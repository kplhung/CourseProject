        <p>In most political contests, Labor Day is a point of embarkation: the start of a two-month journey during which the candidates campaign in earnest, when the themes and issues that will shape the race fall into place, and when voters start to judge who the candidates are and what they are saying.</p>
        <p>But for Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio, the starting gun is firing on a Senate race that has, in one form or another, been running for nearly 20 months now. The result is what both sides described this weekend as a distorted playing field that is complicating nearly every strategic decision they face between now and Election Day, and that is working to the decided disadvantage of the Democratic first lady and the Republican congressman from Suffolk County.</p>

        <p>In most political contests, Labor Day is a point of embarkation: the start of a two-month journey during which the candidates campaign in earnest, when the themes and issues that will shape the race fall into place, and when voters start to judge who the candidates are and what they are saying.</p>
        <p>But for Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio, the starting gun is firing on a Senate race that has, in one form or another, been running for nearly 20 months now. The result is what both sides described this weekend as a distorted playing field that is complicating nearly every strategic decision they face between now and Election Day, and that is working to the decided disadvantage of the Democratic first lady and the Republican congressman from Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>For the electorate, the extended ramp up to the general election has resulted in a form of voter fatigue, the result of an unusual familiarity with the candidates that comes from the near-saturation coverage of this race. That is particularly the case for Mrs. Clinton, who has been at this almost full time since last summer, but also for Mr. Lazio, who bounded onto the field in May.</p>
        <p>Senior advisers to both candidates say this has raised the bar on what the candidates need to do to capture the attention of New Yorkers, and it accounts for the early barrage of high-octane attacks from both campaigns.</p>
        <p>As important, advisers to both candidates say, this long preamble has brought a magnifying glass to the political skills of Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton, neither of whom has ever run for statewide office before. As a result, the discussion among political leaders on this Labor Day is more apt to be about the candidates' weaknesses, which are considerable, rather than their strengths. And there is a realization that with nine weeks left to go, these two candidates are unlikely to get much better.</p>
        <p>''Both of them are in a bad dynamic,'' said Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant who was a senior adviser to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's aborted Senate campaign.  Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant who is not affiliated with either candidate, said the long run-up to the general election has made things ''much, much harder'' for both of them.</p>
        <p>Consider Mrs. Clinton. The first lady is, by any measure, a much more skilled candidate than she was when she began her ''listening tour'' in upstate New York in July 1999. She has told friends in Washington that she has come to appreciate, if not quite share, her husband's passion for the campaign trail, after a long period in which she viewed it as an unpleasant chore.</p>
        <p>Yet Mrs. Clinton continues to come across as scripted, measured and, at times, uncomfortable in public settings. To the continued frustration of many Democratic leaders, she remains stubbornly cautious and averse to taking chances, a trait that is arguably not ideal for someone seeking a public office in New York.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is said to be more apt to rely on lessons drawn from past races and on contemporary polling, rather than on her instincts or those of her advisers, in deciding how to proceed. Thus, although Mrs. Clinton is in the thick of a highly unconventional contest, she is running a very conventional campaign. Her talk of ''children and families'' and attempts to tie Mr. Lazio to conservative policies in Washington make her sound very much like dozens of Democrats who are running for Congress but happen not to call the White House their home.</p>
        <p>There are many New York Democrats who contend that that approach is not enough to defeat Mr. Lazio, given the unusually strong dislike for Mrs. Clinton among many voters. And many of them also note that a comparison of polls today with those of a year ago suggests that she is running in place. But her strategy is unlikely to change, said one of Mrs. Clinton's longtime advisers, who described her as confident and comfortable with the careful course she has charted.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Lazio, when he first entered the race, several Democrats warned that he posed a more serious threat to Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Giuliani did. He did not carry the weight of Mr. Giuliani's unpopularity in some parts of New York, and, perhaps most important, he seemed to bring a hunger for victory and an appetite for campaigning that Mr. Giuliani seemed to lack.</p>
        <p>But this weekend, it was as easy to find Republican officials expressing concern about Mr. Lazio's campaigning skills as it was to find Democrats fretting about Mrs. Clinton. (These are the kind of observations that tend to be offered anonymously -- to guard against charges of disloyalty -- but enthusiastically, in the hope that a public airing of the views might prod the candidates into reconsidering their ways.)</p>
        <p>The most serious and abiding concern about Mr. Lazio is how he comes across as a candidate. Although he is 42 and was elected to Congress in 1992, his own advisers acknowledge that he sometimes seems more like a junior member of a Suffolk County town board than a potential successor to Daniel P. Moynihan, one of the nation's most distinguished senators. Mrs. Clinton's advisers view this as a definite advantage, and are considering such things as having the first lady deliver a foreign policy address in an academic setting to press the difference.</p>
        <p>And to the concern of some senior New York Republican leaders, Mr. Lazio has yet to do anything to address this liability. Instead, he has indulged in some campaign moments that seem to stress the lighter side of his personality. For example, he was photographed plunging, feet first, down a slide at the Erie County Fair; a few days later, he wiped his feet on a doormat with Hillary's name affixed to it. At the same time, he has made only one major speech, on tax cuts, and has resisted pressure from some advisers to do more.</p>
        <p>The other area of concern among Republicans is the lax pace of Mr. Lazio's campaign, which stands in contrast to Mrs. Clinton's more energetic efforts this year. For example, both candidates announced that they were taking off a few days before Labor Day, with Mr. Lazio heading out to the Hamptons and Mrs. Clinton going to the White House and to the Finger Lakes.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton seemed to do anything but vacation. In Washington, she summoned her campaign staff to the White House, where she went through several hours of debate practice, with Bob Barnett, a Washington lawyer and book agent, playing the part of Mr. Lazio. Mr. Barnett played the part of President Bush in mock debates with Bill Clinton in 1992.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also went to two fund-raisers and spent three hours at the State Fair in Syracuse.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Lazio appears to have been serious about his vacation plans, venturing out only once -- to a beach club in Breezy Point, Queens, yesterday, where he shook hands and pronounced himself ''very comfortable with where we are in key parts of this state.'' He has gone days without appearing at a single public campaign event. And when he offered a tax cut plan two weeks ago, one reason it was notable was that it the first major policy address he had given since entering the race.</p>
        <p>''She is working a lot harder,'' said a senior New York Republican strategist who is one of Mr. Lazio's most public supporters. ''And she's beginning to hit her stride.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, said the candidate had used this time to raise money and prepare himself for the fall campaign. And there are clearly some strategic considerations here: Mr. Lazio has told his aides that the best way to win the race is to keep the spotlight on Mrs. Clinton. He has, one adviser said, repeatedly resisted stepping up his campaign schedule or scheduling any more major speeches for now.</p>
        <p>But some of Mr. Lazio's advisers have concluded that that tactic will not work against Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Dal Col said Mr. Lazio would soon begin to spell out a more detailed campaign agenda. The question then will be whether he waited too long.</p>
