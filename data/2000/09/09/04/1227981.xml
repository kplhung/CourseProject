        <p>There's a lot of good news to report this Labor Day. Unemployment is very low and wages are rising. The benefits of the booming economy are being widely distributed.

        <p>There's a lot of good news to report this Labor Day. Unemployment is very low and wages are rising. The benefits of the booming economy are being widely distributed. Workers at the bottom are finally enjoying significant increases in their inflation-adjusted wages. Better yet, the U.S. is experiencing a surge in the growth of labor productivity which, as noted in a book-length report from the Economic Policy Institute, is ''probably the best indicator of an economy's capacity to provide for the material needs of its population.''</p>
        <p>This good news is the result of the rapid economic growth and most especially the sustained low unemployment that really got rolling in the mid-1990's. The key issue has always been the same for working people -- jobs, jobs, jobs.</p>
        <p>''Employment opportunities have expanded considerably, especially for historically disadvantaged groups, including women, blacks and Hispanics,'' the report said. ''The long-term rise in job instability and job insecurity, which continued well into the current economic recovery, finally appeared to have abated at the end of the last decade.</p>
        <p>''Even the share of workers in nonstandard -- often substandard -- work arrangements, such as temporary work and part-time work, has declined as opportunities for regular full-time employment have grown.''</p>
        <p>Nirvana, yes?</p>
        <p>Well, no.</p>
        <p>For one thing, there's the time crunch. Families with children have had to work harder and harder over the past few decades to maintain a decent standard of living, and that phenomenon continues. The number of earners per family has increased, as have the average number of weeks worked per year, and the number of hours worked per week.</p>
        <p>That doesn't leave a lot of quality time for families to enjoy the benefits of their added income. As a woman in New Jersey recently said: ''We're a working family all right. That's all we do is work.''</p>
        <p>And then there's the matter of indebtedness. The institute's report, which is titled ''The State of Working America 2000-01'' and is published by Cornell University Press, makes it clear that despite the rosy stock market stories of the past few years, the typical American family accumulated more debt in the 1990's than it made from the appreciation of stocks.</p>
        <p>The authors wrote:</p>
        <p>''The total wealth of the typical American household improved only marginally during the 1990's. The net worth of the typical household rose about $2,200 in the 1990's -- from $58,800 in 1989 to $61,000 in 1998. While this household's assets grew modestly -- stock assets were up by $5,500 and nonstock assets by $8,500 -- its debt rose as well, by $11,800. Thus, the relatively modest gains in stock and nonstock assets combined with the offsetting rise in household debt meant that the 1990's were far less generous to typical households than business-page headlines often suggest.''</p>
        <p>''Middle-income families are ahead of where they were four or five years ago to the tune of two or three or four thousand dollars, and that's not chicken feed,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist and one of the authors of the report. ''But they are more indebted, working more and more hours, and the stock market boom has largely passed them by.''</p>
        <p>The times may be terrific, but American working families are not well-prepared for significant downside economic surprises. ''On some level,'' said Mr. Bernstein, ''their future is largely dependent on staying where we are with regard to unemployment and productivity.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the public profile of the poor has diminished almost to the point of invisibility. But they are still there. Despite the economic gains of the past few years, the national poverty rate in 1998 -- the latest year for which complete statistical data was available -- was 12.7 percent, just one tenth of a percentage point less than in 1989, and one full percentage point higher than in 1979.</p>
        <p>Nearly one in five American children lives in poverty.</p>
        <p>The tight labor market is helping, and poor families are working more. But the progress is painfully slow.</p>
        <p>Historians will look back at Labor Day 2000 and marvel at how well America was doing. And then they will assess how wisely, during these best of times, we invested our considerable resources in the unfinished business of creating a brighter future for everyone.</p>
