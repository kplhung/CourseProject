        <p>A fast-moving fire, apparently set by an arsonist who doused a staircase with flammable liquid, roared through a Bedford-Stuyvesant building early yesterday morning, killing a woman who was trapped behind a locked window grate in a third-floor apartment and a man in the building, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>A second man was seriously injured in his leap to the sidewalk from a third-floor window, and four firefighters suffered minor injuries extinguishing the blaze.</p>
        <p>The fire broke out shortly after 6:30 a.m. in a narrow brick building at 1483 Fulton Street in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Lt. Michael Bell, of Engine Company 214, was one of the first to arrive. He said one victim, Richardo Williams, 36, was lying on the sidewalk, having jumped from the building's top floor. Mr. Williams suffered multiple fractures and ruptured several organs, firefighters said, but he managed to tell bystanders that others were trapped inside.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Bell and other firefighters fought their way up the front staircase to search the five single-room apartments on the top floor.</p>
        <p>''It looked like a river; the middle of the stairs was burning,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When they reached the third floor, firefighters found the body of Armony Bevel, 18, who had been burned to death, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Another team of firefighters climbed the rear fire escape and found a severely burned woman, identified only as Viola, unconscious underneath a third-floor rear window. Burns covered 90 percent of her body, fire officials said. The woman's arms were also cut, apparently from breaking the window and then trying, in vain, to remove a lock on a grate that prevented her from reaching the fire escape.</p>
        <p>Viola, who was 55, died about 3:45 p.m. yesterday at Interfaith Medical Center-St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Brooklyn. She had not regained consciousness, fire officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams was in critical condition last night after surgery at Kings County Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>The fire was under control at 7:30 a.m., the authorities said.</p>
        <p>No arrests were made in the hours immediately after the fire, but police and fire marshals said they were pursuing several leads.</p>
        <p>One witness, who was walking down the street with her laundry as the fire erupted, said she saw a man, who is believed to have ignited the entire three-story length of the inside staircase, running from the building with one of his sneakers on fire. He kicked off the burning sneaker and then jumped into a sport utility vehicle and sped away, the witness said.</p>
        <p>Fire officials said they recovered the shoe, which they described as a black Nike basketball sneaker.</p>
        <p>The police were also interviewing Gina DuBong, the owner of the building and of two businesses that had recently operated in it, who was said to have been involved in several recent disputes.</p>
        <p>Mr. DuBong, who the authorities and his neighbors said is a transvestite, ran a tarot card shop out of his second-floor apartment. The shop's sign advertised ''Sister DuBong, Spiritual Doctor, African Reader, Adviser,'' and neighbors said several people had been angry at what they described as its consistently wrong predictions.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the authorities and neighbors said, Mr. DuBong also ran the Underground Network record store from the building's ground floor, but neighbors said many customers thought they had been bilked, and the shop closed in late June.</p>
        <p>Many in the neighborhood said they were bothered by the late-night parties, replete with booming music and dancing, that Mr. DuBong was said to have held regularly in the tarot card shop.</p>
        <p>The authorities said Mr. DuBong had been grazed in the forehead during a shooting last year. They also said they believe that Mr. DuBong is the father of Mr. Bevel, the 18-year-old man who died in the fire.</p>
        <p>Deputy Chief Charles R. Blaich, the fire division commander, said the building had at least two fire code violations, one for the locked window grate and one for not having sprinklers in the single-room apartments on the third floor.</p>
