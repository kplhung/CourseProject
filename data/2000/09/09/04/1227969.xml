        <p>Negotiators for Bridgestone/Firestone and the union representing 8,000 of its workers continued talks in St. Louis yesterday as they sought to reach a tentative contract and avert a threatened strike.</p>

        <p>Negotiators for Bridgestone/Firestone and the union representing 8,000 of its workers continued talks in St. Louis yesterday as they sought to reach a tentative contract and avert a threatened strike.</p>
        <p>The union, the United Steelworkers of America, said there had been enough progress in the talks to warrant keeping workers on the job even though the union originally planned to begin a strike early Saturday if no agreement was reached by then.</p>
        <p>''We are still slogging away,'' said John Duray, a union spokesman. ''If progress weren't being made, we wouldn't still be at the table.''</p>
        <p>Officials with Bridgestone/Firestone, which is based in Nashville, also said yesterday that they were optimistic a settlement could be reached without a strike threatened at 9 of its 11 United States factories.</p>
        <p>A strike would involve workers at factories in Akron, Ohio; Bloomington, Ill.; Decatur, Ill.; Des Moines; Noblesville, Ind.; Oklahoma City, Russellville, Ark.; LaVergne, Tenn.; and Warren County, Tenn.</p>
