        <p>Upset with himself for walking Torii Hunter in the 10th inning yesterday, Mariano Rivera tried to get back into his normal routine: he glanced toward the runner at first from the set position, then looked away, all the while deciding where to throw the ball.</p>
        <p>With Rivera in the set position, Hunter, the Minnesota Twins' center fielder, took off for second base. Rivera seemed oblivious to what was happening.</p>
        <p>First baseman Tino Martinez and shortstop Derek Jeter began yelling: ''Step off! Step off!'' But by the time Rivera heard their shouts, Hunter was more than halfway to second and Rivera had committed to throwing to first.</p>
        <p>The play was blown, and as a result, the Twins had a runner in scoring position in a 1-1 game. After Manager Joe Torre ordered an intentional walk of Jacque Jones, the No. 8 batter in the lineup, Rivera served up a two-out single to pinch-hitter Denny Hocking, which drove in Hunter and gave the Twins a 2-1 victory at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>The odd lapse, which Rivera said had never happened to him before, cost the Yankees a chance at a series sweep of the Twins and sullied another strong performance by Roger Clemens, who threw eight solid innings, nearly half of them in the rain, allowing three hits and one run. Afterward, Rivera (7-4) was angry with himself, not for taking his eyes off the runner, but for walking the speedy Hunter to begin with.</p>
        <p>''When I hear 'Step off' that means throw to second, but I was already on my way to first,'' Rivera said. ''If I had thrown to second, it would have been a balk. But that's not the point. The point is that if I never walked the guy, that never would have happened. He just timed it perfect. I was aware that he wanted to run, but I wasn't expecting that.''</p>
        <p>Torre said that the Yankees worked on that scenario throughout the spring, and that Rivera usually handled the situation better than anyone else.</p>
        <p>''He obviously didn't see the runner, because normally you see the runner and just step off -- that's your first natural reaction,'' Torre said. ''We beat ourselves basically with that play. It's unfortunate that we let this one get away because at home you should win extra-inning games.''</p>
        <p>Had the Yankees been able to solve the rookie right-hander Matt Kinney, who held them to two hits and one run over six innings, Clemens would have emerged with his eighth straight victory. Working masterly through the Twins' lineup, Clemens registered eight strikeouts while walking one. His one weak moment came in the seventh, when Ray Coomer sent a fastball over the left-field wall.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, Clemens was the dominating pitcher fans have seen since he was activated off the disabled list on July 2. Yesterday's outing was his 13th straight without a loss since his return.</p>
        <p>''Roger was terrific,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Facing a lineup that entered with a .140 batting average against him (13 for 93), Clemens retired the first nine Twins he faced. Minnesota's first hit came in the fourth, on a ground ball to left field by second baseman Jay Canizaro.</p>
        <p>Clemens got the next three hitters out, then the rain came. The umpires told Clemens that a delay might soon follow, so, for a moment, he admitted to slipping out of his groove. Still, the Twins managed only one hit over the next two innings.</p>
        <p>In the eighth, the rain began falling with the speed and ferocity of one of Clemens's fastballs. After another 1-2-3 inning, Clemens walked slowly off the field, knowing that his work was through. The tarp came next, starting a 54-minute delay.</p>
        <p>Kinney was not as powerful as Clemens, but his slick timing with his curveball kept the Yankees off balance.</p>
        <p>Only Martinez got to him, hammering his 13th home run of the season in the second inning.</p>
        <p>''He had pretty good stuff -- he was kind of funky,'' Martinez said of Kinney. ''He threw hard and had a good breaking ball and a funky delivery.''</p>
        <p>Martinez nearly ended the game in the ninth when he drove a pitch from Eddie Guardado (5-3) off the top of the wall in right-center field. When Martinez connected, the Yankees in the dugout, including Torre, rose, hoping the shot would clear the fence.</p>
        <p>When it didn't -- it was a long single -- the 10th inning, and Rivera's strange gaffe, followed.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH threw for the first time in five days before the game, but Manager JOE TORRE said it could be awhile before he plays. ''He's going to come out early tomorrow,'' Torre said. ''If he looks good, we can consider putting him in there. I'm not really sure how I would do that right now. He has to be comfortable after not playing in a while. The first thing will be to take some batting practice so he can get comfortable. Then, we'll make a decision on when he can play.'' . . . The Yankees will begin a four-game series at Kansas City tonight. ANDY PETTITTE (16-7) will pitch for the Yankees.</p>
