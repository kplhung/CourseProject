        <p>Two strategic substitutions by United States Coach Bruce Arena turned out for the best and for the worst in a World Cup qualifying game this afternoon against Guatemala.</p>
        <p>The insertion of Cobi Jones paid the highest dividend. He created the game's only goal, with a perfect cross to Brian McBride, in the United States' 1-0 victory.</p>
        <p>The victory came before a sellout crowd at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium and put the Americans a step closer to advancing to the regional finals. That six-nation round-robin tournament next year will decide the three nations that will represent the North and Central American and the Caribbean region in the 2002 World Cup finals in Japan and South Korea.</p>
        <p>Jones, who entered the game in the 57th minute, took a pass from Jovan Kirovski on the right flank. He accelerated to the penalty area and then crossed the ball to McBride at the far post, who scored from 6 yards with a low, left-footed shot in the 72nd minute, with the Americans a man down.</p>
        <p>''We needed a goal,'' Arena said of his decision to insert Jones for Tony Sanneh and Eddie Lewis for Earnie Stewart. The United States then went to a 3-5-2 formation -- three defenders, five midfielders and two forwards -- after having used a 4-4-2.</p>
        <p>Lewis, the other substitution, was ejected seven minutes after he entered for a violent foul on Guatemala's Fabricio Benitez. His ejection left the Americans a man short against a disciplined and determined Guatemala's defense.</p>
        <p>''One change worked, the other didn't,'' Arena said.</p>
        <p>Jones found a way to make the right play after the Americans had failed to come up with the formula to beat the Guatemalan defense and goalkeeper Edgar Estrada.</p>
        <p>''Cobi basically made a perfect ball,'' McBride said of the pass. ''He teased the goalkeeper a little to the point he had to come out, and left me with an easy job.''</p>
        <p>It was McBride's second goal of this qualifying round and 13th in 45 international appearances for the United States. He scored the team's only goal in the 2-1 loss to Iran in the 1998 World Cup that left the Americans last among the 32 countries in France.</p>
        <p>The United States (2-1-1) is second in its regional semifinal group with 7 points. Costa Rica (3-1), which posted a 3-0 victory today over Barbados, is first with 9 points. Guatemala (1-2-1) is third with 4 points. The Americans have two games left in the group, against Costa Rica (Oct. 11 in Columbus, Ohio) and at Barbados (1-3) (Nov. 15). The top two teams will qualify for the regional finals.</p>
        <p>Before McBride scored, the Americans had little offensive success. Their crosses from the flanks were elementary to defend and they were losing their air battles at both ends of the field.</p>
        <p>Arena decided to start Kirovski in place of Jones because he wanted to have the flexibility of changing strategies during the game. ''Jovan is the most natural-looking player who can become a third forward if we decide to change tactics,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Arena added: ''This was a great win for our confidence. Guatemala is a tough team to break down. It was a great play by Cobi on the goal. We expected this to be a 1-0 game. The crowd was also 50-50, and it was good for us.''</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>The crowd of 51,996 was the third largest to watch the Americans in a World Cup qualifying game. . . . EARNIE STEWART drew his second yellow card in this qualifying round and he will miss the game against Costa Rica. . .  Guatemala's JULIO GIRON, EVERALDO VALENCIA and DWIGHT PEZZAROSSI will also miss the next game for getting yellow cards. . . .The Americans have gone without a loss in a World Cup qualifying game at home since a 1-0 loss to Costa Rica in 1985, a stretch of 15 games.</p>
