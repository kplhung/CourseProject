        <p>Nassau County's long road back to fiscal health starts Tuesday, when County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta is to present the outlines of a fiscal plan intended to bring the county back from the brink of bankruptcy,</p>
        <p>The proposal is to be presented to Frank G. Zarb, who heads the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the independent oversight board set up by the state to help the county restructure its debt. Tuesday's informal proposal is to be followed by a formal four-year-plan and a 2001 budget to be presented on Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's task is daunting. He must balance a budget that is currently projected to be $70 million in the red and find a combination of cuts and revenue increases of $150 million in the following two years. If he fails to do so by the end of next month, the authority will morph into a control board, seizing control of the county's finances and leaving elected officials with little or no say about spending and taxation.</p>
        <p>And Judith A. Jacobs, the majority leader of the County Legislature, said that Mr. Gulotta's financial advisers told her tonight that they expect an additional $60 million gap in the 2001 budget. According to Ms. Jacobs, a Democrat, the shortfall involves deficits at the Nassau County Medical Center, unforseen debt service obligations and higher-than-expected costs for public transportation.</p>
        <p>''It's very disappointing,'' Ms. Jacobs said.</p>
        <p>As officials await the report from Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, almost no one in either party is expressing any optimism that a workable plan to solve the county's budget crisis is in sight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta has raised eyebrows with a preliminary plan that he has brought to financial meetings over the past month. The proposal offers things like $6 million in savings from streamlining the government, but offers no specifics on how those savings will be achieved. It offers millions in savings in the police budget, even though there is no contract for next year and relations with the Nassau County Police Benevolent Association are frayed.</p>
        <p>It does not mention property tax increases, and Mr. Gulotta has said in the past that he would not raise them. Nor does it address the antiquated property tax system. Because of overinflated assessments of homes and businesses, property owners contest them, and win judgments. As a result, school districts find their budgets short millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Property values are being recalculated in a countywide property reassessment, but no one is sure whether the new assessments will eliminate or reduce challenges. The challenges affect the county, not just school districts, because, in an arrangement found virtually nowhere else in the state, the county is bound by law to pick up the debt of its school districts and towns. Year after year, Mr. Gulotta's budgets have failed to anticipate that expense, officials in both parties say.</p>
        <p>''Quite frankly, he has not been that forthright to this point,'' County Comptroller Frederick A. Parola, a Republican, said of the Gulotta plan. ''He needs to produce a balanced blueprint. The budget has to be real and can be lived with. I'm deeply concerned. He doesn't have a good track record.''</p>
        <p>An official with the new finance authority, who has listened to Mr. Gulotta's most recent proposals and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, was more blunt. ''What is required here are significant property tax increases and a reduction in county services. That's the reality. No one believes he's bringing that to the table on Tuesday. There is no core to his plan.''</p>
        <p>No one disputes the depth of the county's problems. Nassau, with one of the wealthiest tax bases in the country, now finds itself more than $2 billion in debt. Wall Street bond-rating agencies have downgraded the county's bonds to a level just above junk, and it took a $105 million, five-year bailout from the state to keep the county solvent.</p>
        <p>The first problem for Mr. Gulotta is that only $600 million of the county's $2.2 billion budget can be cut without violating state or federal laws or union contracts. And of that $600 million, much of it is tied up in necessary departments like the district attorney's office and sewer districts. Ultimately, the conditions of the deal that created the finance agency will force Nassau to pare back one of the most generous arrays of public services -- in schools, parks and police -- anywhere in the nation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta is required by Mr. Zarb to hand the proposal to Ms. Jacobs and to Peter J. Schmitt, the legislature's Republican minority leader, before tomorrow. But as of today, neither had seen his proposal. Mr. Gulotta did not return phone calls to his office seeking comment, but his spokeswoman, Diane Baumert-Moyik said: ''We're still working on it. It's due on the 5th and we can't offer any specifics until then.''</p>
        <p>''It's the 11th hour and there is no consensus,'' said Mr. Schmitt. ''My guess is that Gulotta leaves the dirty work to us. He'll offer something unrealistic, like he has for the past four-and-a-half years. He's said he'll wrangle concessions from the unions, but there'll be no concessions.''</p>
        <p>There is agreement that there are four issues Mr. Gulotta will need to address in his blueprint: union concessions, the streamlining and reorganization of county government, tax increases and the looming property tax reassessment that could double the tax burden for some of the county's wealthiest voters.</p>
        <p>The two largest unions in Nassau County are the Police Benevolent Association, which represents nearly 3,000 officers, and the 6,000 member Civil Service Employees Association. The police budget is $520 million, 23 percent of the county budget. Nearly 90 percent of those costs are salaries and benefits that are mandated by the union's contract.</p>
        <p>The contract expires at the end of this year and Mr. Gulotta and the union representatives are trying to hammer out an agreement in order to avoid uncertainties if the control board should take over. According to officials familiar with the deal, police salaries will rise by 20.5 percent over the next five years, even though Nassau's officers are among the highest-paid in the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta has estimated that the county will spend $60 million less if the five-year contract is approved than the officers would receive if the county was forced by binding arbitration to pay 5 percent yearly increases -- similar to those won by Suffolk County officers last year.</p>
        <p>By the county executive's arithmetic, the county will also save money through attrition: 200 officers are expected to retire this year and 100 next year. Those positions will not be filled. Instead, 100 officers on desk duty will be assigned to patrol work, and lower-paid civilians will be hired to take up the desk duties. Smaller savings will be realized by measures like reducing police overtime and eliminating Flag Day as a paid holiday, officials said.</p>
        <p>The proposal now sits on the desk of union officials. ''The devil is in the details,'' said Gary DelaRaba, the police union president. ''I believe it is possible to offer raises and bring in savings. We're just not there yet.''</p>
        <p>Legislators who must ratify any contract, are skeptical.</p>
        <p>''Gulotta can't say there are $20 million of union concessions, and the contract still costs 2 percent more every year,'' said Ms. Jabobs, the majority leader of the Legislature.  ''I haven't seen that contract. There has been no analysis here.''</p>
        <p>The largest county workers' union also appears unwilling to make further concessions. Anthony Giustino, president of Local 830 of the Civil Service Employees Association, said that his members had agreed in June to a one-time deal where they would defer two weeks of pay this year, which they will receive when they resign or retire. The measure saved the county $20 million and Mr. Gulotta backed off on his threat of layoffs.</p>
        <p>The union's members ''were told that's all we would need to do,'' Mr. Giustino said. ''We were told that would be it. Any attempt to get more out of us would be a renege on the deal. We don't have anything more to give.''</p>
