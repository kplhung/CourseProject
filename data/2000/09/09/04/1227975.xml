        <p>Editorial rejects Richard Cheney's charge that Clinton administration has been 'willy nilly' designating millions of acres of public land as national monuments, thereby protecting them from mining and other forms of commercial development; says land already belongs to federal government and Interior Sec Bruce Babbitt has indeed consulted with local residents</p>

        <p>Last week, Richard Cheney provided further evidence of the divide between the two main presidential candidates on environmental issues when he criticized the Clinton administration for the way it has been designating millions of acres of public land as national monuments, thereby protecting them from mining and other forms of commercial development.</p>
        <p>The Republican vice presidential nominee did not, as originally reported, threaten to ''rescind'' these monument designations, nor did he say that he would ask Congress to do so. Under law, only Congress has the power to roll back a designation. However, he made one telling remark that has annoyed the White House while reinforcing the impression that a Bush administration would be much more reluctant than Mr. Clinton has been to use federal power to expand wilderness protections.</p>

        <p>Last week, Richard Cheney provided further evidence of the divide between the two main presidential candidates on environmental issues when he criticized the Clinton administration for the way it has been designating millions of acres of public land as national monuments, thereby protecting them from mining and other forms of commercial development.</p>
        <p>The Republican vice presidential nominee did not, as originally reported, threaten to ''rescind'' these monument designations, nor did he say that he would ask Congress to do so. Under law, only Congress has the power to roll back a designation. However, he made one telling remark that has annoyed the White House while reinforcing the impression that a Bush administration would be much more reluctant than Mr. Clinton has been to use federal power to expand wilderness protections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney charged that Mr. Clinton had used his authority ''willy-nilly all over the West'' without consulting local residents or accommodating their needs. Mr. Clinton has designated 11 monuments -- the first encompassing 1.7 million acres in Utah's canyonlands, the latest protecting 197,000 acres of the Hanford Reach, the last undammed stretch on the Columbia River. Mr. Cheney's remarks suggested that in these and other designations, Mr. Clinton had undermined private property rights. But in fact the land in question already belonged to the federal government. A monument designation simply gave it a higher level of protection against future intrusions by, say, the mining industry. Furthermore, the interior secretary, Bruce Babbitt, has spent weeks talking to local residents. The interests of existing stakeholders, mainly ranchers with grazing allotments, have been largely preserved.</p>
        <p>It is also true, however, that a monument designation is a quintessentially federal act, imposed from above by the executive branch. Although that is just what Congress intended in 1906 when it passed the Antiquities Act, giving the president unilateral authority to rescue historic sites imperiled by Congressional inaction, recent Republican presidents have resisted using it. Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush are the only chief executives since 1906 not to designate at least one monument.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush is on that wavelength. He says he sees an important federal role in conservation, but mainly as a manager of existing parks and wilderness areas and as a ''partner'' in local conservation efforts. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, is prepared to use federal powers pre-emptively to protect additional lands from development, and presumably Mr. Gore would do the same. It is that expansive view of the federal role, as much as anything, that prompted Mr. Cheney's criticism.</p>
