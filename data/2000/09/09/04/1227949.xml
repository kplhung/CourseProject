        <p>It's hardly a surprise to be told that every good artist creates a world of her or his own. But to move from the world of Alice Neel to that of Barbara Kruger (separated by a single floor at the Whitney Museum of American Art) is to feel you have moved from one species to another, from people who claim their individuality as a natural right to people who see the world as one big central casting agency in which everyone, not least themselves, is a desirable or an undesirable type.</p>
        <p>Of course it's a question of temperament. Neel was a humanist who treated her subjects with clinical compassion. Ms. Kruger is a critic and muckraker who treats hers with satirical fury. But history separates these artists every bit as much as temperament. Neel was born in 1900. She came of age when the particulars of neighborhood, region, faces and bodies, however unlovely, dominated the culture's imagination.</p>

        <p>It's hardly a surprise to be told that every good artist creates a world of her or his own. But to move from the world of Alice Neel to that of Barbara Kruger (separated by a single floor at the Whitney Museum of American Art) is to feel you have moved from one species to another, from people who claim their individuality as a natural right to people who see the world as one big central casting agency in which everyone, not least themselves, is a desirable or an undesirable type.</p>
        <p>Of course it's a question of temperament. Neel was a humanist who treated her subjects with clinical compassion. Ms. Kruger is a critic and muckraker who treats hers with satirical fury. But history separates these artists every bit as much as temperament. Neel was born in 1900. She came of age when the particulars of neighborhood, region, faces and bodies, however unlovely, dominated the culture's imagination.</p>
        <p>Like so many artists during the Depression, Neel worked for the Federal Arts Project, painting all the neighborhoods of New York City. But her love of portraiture and place had begun in the 1920's, when she was living la vie de boheme in the Village, and it continued through her years in Spanish Harlem and Midtown Manhattan. (It seems she never met a visual abstraction she much liked.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Kruger was born midcentury, in 1945. The mass media was already revved up in the 1920's, but baby boomers grew up during its imperial expansion years when everything from newspapers to televisions to computers made their way into every home and sometimes every room of every home. The fantasies of advertising, movies and television belong as much to our unconscious as do those Greek tragedies and German fairy tales psychoanalysts dissected in such detail. (Or as an analyst friend of mine once said about someone: ''I get it. His inner life is based on Tom and Jerry.'')</p>
        <p>Neel, who died in 1984, was a purist about her medium, devoted to painting and painting only. Ms. Kruger is an insistent hybrid: she reworks old (but rarely pre-1940's) and contemporary photographs that she finds in all kinds of places -- business, movie and fashion magazines, how-to books and manuals -- then joins them to uncluttered (even stark) graphic design.</p>
        <p>Every picture has its verbal element. And words come at you; she covers floors and walls with them. They shout, they sneer, they challenge (''If you're so successful, why do you feel like a fake?''). They insist on their power and righteousness, be it social, religious, ethnic or sexual. ''What I love is more compelling than what you love. More profound, more riveting, sexier. My taste is more developed than yours. Hipper, more knowing, more evolved.'' And ''God said it. I believe it. And that settles it.''</p>
        <p>Everything is fortissimo. The images are just as strong but more layered and fractured; her reworkings move everyday photographs toward the gothic. See a middle-aged white man with strangely crumpled skin and one eye at the bottom of his forehead. Look at the black rectangle on his chin and read the words ''Look like us'' in white type. A large pair of scissors lies partly open. They look black and cast a gray-black shadow on the white surface. Between the blades is a red box with the question  ''Who speaks?'' in white type. Beneath the handle is an identical box with the words ''Who is silent?''</p>
        <p>''It's good to get back to the human,'' I heard a woman say as we entered Neel's exhibition space. But that was no indictment of Ms. Kruger but rather a stricken acknowledgment of the artist's power. ''Back to the human'': Neel lets us go back and see ourselves as people who have life outside of ruthless cultural and political scripts. Look at her aged mother in ''Last Sickness'': the scared eyes and the mouth pressed into a tight little line; the messy hair and the dowdy bathrobe. It's that awful thing you see in the dying: the physical letting go and the emotional holding on.</p>
        <p>The young man from Spanish Harlem in ''Call Me Joe'' is a beauty with his pompadour and elegant long-sleeved white T-shirt beneath a short-sleeved print shirt? Why is he so melancholy? What does he know about his future that we don't? And did Henry Geldhazer, the curator of 20th-century art at the Metropolitan Museum when Neel painted him, really want to be seen with that chilly, rather petulant expression, trying so hard to look languid and at ease? (Did he see that portrait before he left Neel out of the show he was then organizing, ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970''?)</p>
        <p>Portraiture invites people to honor what sets -- or at least appears to set -- one person apart from others. This must be why it has become so popular again among those wealthy enough to commission portraits of themselves and their families for posterity.</p>
        <p>Work like Ms. Kruger's insists that we see ourselves in the grip of generic thoughts, gestures and words; always on the verge of turning into media objects or receptors.</p>
        <p>That both these artists did portraits of Andy Warhol says everything about the cultural shifts they -- and we -- have lived through. Warhol was the white-faced, white-blond wizard of metamorphosis, turning fine art into mass art, high culture into pop culture. That one-of-a-kind painting became the endlessly reproducible photograph and print; introspection became advertising; and the individual as psychological subject became an icon for mass worship.</p>
        <p>Neel turned Warhol back into a psychological subject. She painted him with his shirt off, in 1970, two years after he had been shot by Valerie Solanis. His eyes are closed; his hands are pressed between his knees: his breasts sag and he wears a stomach brace. He looks like the weary old working-class man, born Andy Warhola, that he might have become had he not remade himself so relentlessly.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kruger places Warhol on the border between the private and the public, or between the psychological and the iconographic. In her photograph he looks cannily boyish, as he did at his peak. But wary too (look at how his hand touches his cheek). All this wizardry had its price. And there in the middle of his face are the words ''Not cruel enough.'' And framing his face, in red, are words that serve as an elegy not unlike the one F. Scott Fitzgerald had a nameless mourner offer at Jay Gatsby's funeral: ''The poor son of a bitch.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kruger's four-square elegy reads: ''Not beautiful enough.'' ''Not man enough.'' ''Not real enough.'' ''Not pathetic enough.'' She does the same thing with portraits of Malcolm X, Eleanor Roosevelt and Marilyn Monroe. They form a quartet of cautionary ghost stories.</p>
        <p>Looking at the work of these women makes me think artists worry too much about being ahead of their time. Maybe the hardest thing of all is to be a real part of one's time, to take it in with all the courage and imagination one can muster.</p>
