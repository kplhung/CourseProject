        <p>Vice President Al Gore begins the fall stretch of the presidential campaign buoyant in the polls and brimming with confidence.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the strongest sign of this self-assurance is the Gore campaign's visible grab for Florida, a state that has been perceived as favoring Gov. George W. Bush for months and where Mr. Bush's brother Jeb is the governor. Gore operatives say they are now slightly ahead in Florida. Mr. Gore has visited the state twice in the last week and is popping into Tampa on Monday morning during his 24-hour whirlwind Labor Day tour.</p>
        <p>In addition, advisers said, either Mr. Gore or Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate, will visit Florida at least once a week from now through the November election, as they will regularly visit other battlegrounds that are becoming increasingly more plausible for the Democrats: Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.</p>
        <p>And while the campaign has already bought television time in three swing markets in Florida -- Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach -- it is planning a big investment in Miami, Tallahassee and other areas as early as this week.</p>
        <p>''When we turn on the lights there,'' said one top Democrat, ''watch out!''</p>
        <p>There is no question that the Gore team is pumped and basking in a spate of positive media coverage. But its euphoria is tempered with caution. There are tricky shoals for Mr. Gore to navigate, and the campaign has some decisions to make. These concern how he will respond to attacks from Mr. Bush, how to present himself as a change from President Clinton even while advocating many of Mr. Clinton's policies, and how to counter the impression of voters that Mr. Gore is weaker on certain personality traits.</p>
        <p>A memorandum from Hickman-Brown Research Inc., a firm that conducts polls for the Gore campaign, says that Mr. Gore has made strides in important ways. His personal popularity is up, it says, and voters agree with his positions on most issues that are most important to them and have more faith in him than in Governor Bush to carry out certain presidential duties, like managing foreign policy and preparing the country for the future.</p>
        <p>But the memorandum also says that Mr. Gore has shown major improvements in some areas of vulnerability. The pollsters refer to these as ''key personal dimensions,'' which they define as traits related to leadership and trustworthiness, although Republicans perceive him as vulnerable on matters of credibility.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush is an aggressive opponent, however, flush with cash, and he has already demonstrated that he will not lie down for a Gore steamrollering. The Republicans, who have spent twice as much as Mr. Gore on television commercials, are on the air now skewering Mr. Gore's credibility on improving the campaign finance system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is also stepping up his criticism that the Clinton administration has squandered the opportunities of the last eight years. Republicans say that commercials in the works show Mr. Clinton making the same promises in 1992 -- for a middle-class tax cut, for a prescription drug benefit for the elderly -- that Mr. Gore is making today.</p>
        <p>How severely, and how soon,  should Mr. Gore respond? He has a reputation as a cutthroat competitor whose aggressiveness can fire up the partisans but alienate independents and swing voters. The Gore team is deploying countless surrogates, including Mr. Lieberman, to make the case against Mr. Bush. But there is some internal debate about the level on which Mr. Gore should engage.</p>
        <p>His recent challenge that Mr. Bush should ''put up or shut up,'' ridiculed by the Bush campaign as a playground taunt, gave a hint of Mr. Gore's eagerness to get in the fight. But the Democrats withheld a commercial they had prepared last week criticizing Mr. Bush's record in Texas. That is likely to be broadcast in the coming week.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most nettlesome question for the Gore campaign is how to take advantage of the humming economy. In times of peace and prosperity, the incumbent party is almost always rewarded. The good news for the Gore campaign is that internal polling suggests that in several important states, a majority of voters perceive the nation to be on the right track. This has historically been one of the most important indicators for whether or not incumbents are re-elected.</p>
        <p>But for Mr. Gore to have climbed to his place in the polls only now suggests that other factors are at work. The central concern is that while voters appreciate the good times, there is lingering resentment toward Mr. Clinton over his personal behavior, creating a complex web of emotion that still seems to ensnare Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Allan J. Lichtman, a political analyst at American University, who has written about the basic factors on which people vote, said: ''The fundamentals are in Gore's favor. Peace, prosperity, tranquillity at home and a united incumbent party. Why has the race even been close? The Clinton scandals.''</p>
        <p>Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, said that of all the issues voters rank as important, one, declining moral values, hurts Mr. Gore most.</p>
        <p>''This is the aftereffect of impeachment,'' Mr. Goeas said. ''Voters didn't want Republicans to impeach Clinton because they thought it would rock the boat. Now that that is no longer an issue, they are indulging in a second emotion -- they didn't want Clinton impeached, but they think what he did was wrong.''</p>
        <p>Will Mr. Gore pay for that? He has worked hard to close the Clinton chapter, staging a ''passing of the baton'' ceremony before his convention last month and declaring himself in his acceptance speech his ''own man.'' Still, the centerpiece of his campaign is the thriving economy, and the economy is the most sterling part of the Clinton legacy.</p>
        <p>''This election is not an award for past performance,'' Mr. Gore told workers here today. ''I'm not asking you to vote for me on the basis of the economy we had; I'm asking for your support on the basis of the better, fairer, stronger economy that we're going to create together over the next four years.''</p>
        <p>The coming week should reveal more of the Gore strategy as the vice president focuses on the economy, including in a major speech in Cleveland on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's current strategy is to stick to the issues, and to try to make the campaign about the issues on which he has an advantage. Internal polling suggests that undecided voters side with Mr. Gore on health care, Social Security and the economy. They side with Mr. Bush on crime and moral values, and in many states they rate the candidates about even on education.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials indicated that they were not so worried about the lack of support on crime, noting that it is not as big an issue as it was in 1992, and not one that swing voters are making their decisions on.  Also, they suggest, few voters think Mr. Gore has had anything to do with crime rates anyway, so it is not very fertile ground for him.</p>
        <p>But declining moral values are another matter. Mr. Gore is well aware of this, and it goes a long way toward explaining why he picked Mr. Lieberman, with his reputation for rectitude and his history of criticism of Mr. Clinton's personal behavior, as his running mate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goeas said that education and values ranked as the top issues for married women, and that married women, who make up 60 percent of female voters, tended to support Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Tad Devine, a chief strategist for the Gore camp, said that at this point the campaign was trying to reach as broad an audience as possible. In the next few weeks, he said, different groups of people will click in to the election, and they will be ''persuadable'' at different times. He said the campaign was talking about broad themes now, but as the pool of persuadable voters shifted and shrank, the campaign would deliver its message more to specific audiences, largely through direct mail, radio advertising and campaign destinations.</p>
