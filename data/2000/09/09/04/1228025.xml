        <p>For most of the spring and summer, with a seemingly durable advantage in the polls, Gov. George W. Bush chatted genially with voters about his own good intentions, and his swipes at Vice President Al Gore were fairly perfunctory.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore belittled him, Mr. Bush expressed something akin to bemusement.</p>
        <p>No more. As Labor Day opens the curtain on the pivotal act in the 2000 presidential campaign, and Mr. Bush confronts the evaporation of his lead, he and his advisers said that it is no longer enough to tell Americans why they should want the Texas governor in the White House.</p>
        <p>Voters must simultaneously be convinced that they do not want Mr. Gore there. And that is precisely what the Bush campaign intends to do, as it readjusts and adapts its strategy to the higher stakes of the presidential race and the relentless ticking of the clock.</p>
        <p>In interviews over the last few days, Republican officials tied to the Bush campaign said a new Republican television commercial last week that cast Mr. Gore as an untrustworthy, untruthful chameleon was a harbinger of similar television salvos.</p>
        <p>And it signaled what will be a generally heightened aggressiveness by the Bush campaign, apparent today at a news conference here in which Mr. Bush sought to gain the upper hand on the debate over presidential debates, which Mr. Gore has been winning.</p>
        <p>With nine weeks until Election Day, Mr. Bush's advisers said they will also begin picking apart and poking holes in Mr. Gore's policies more assiduously and raising more pointed questions about his leadership abilities.</p>
        <p>''The people who are left after the conventions are the hard sells,'' said Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, referring to the small, crucial cluster of undecided voters.</p>
        <p>''They are no longer going to be driven just by the exposition of a positive agenda,'' Mr. Rove said. ''They're going to say, 'That's fine, but how does that differ from the other guy's?' And that means drawing sharp distinctions and differences in an appropriate way.''</p>
        <p>So when Mr. Bush this week begins discussing a plan for prescription drug benefits under Medicare, he will not simply present his ideas, advisers said. He will also tell older Americans that Mr. Gore's proposal, which involves more federal regulation, smacks of nationalized health care and represents a bid for ''the government to be their pharmacist,'' said Karen P. Hughes, director of communications for the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes was previewing more than a sound bite; she was making clear that the Bush campaign, with increasing vigor, would portray Mr. Gore as an old-style Democrat bent on intrusive government solutions.</p>
        <p>Other Bush campaign officials said that they planned to put a more exacting microscope over Mr. Gore's calls for increased government spending and assert that the vice president's appetite for new programs endangered projected federal surpluses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has levied the same charge against Mr. Bush's sweeping tax cut proposal.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign is also paying close attention to other aspects of the fight -- monitoring polls in battleground states so that Mr. Bush can tailor his schedule to those fluctuating yardsticks.</p>
        <p>After meetings on Saturday in  which Mr. Bush's aides hashed over new evidence that Mr. Gore was pulling ahead in Pennsylvania, the Bush campaign extended his schedule for this week to include a second visit, on Friday, to that crucial state. Mr. Bush was already planning to be there on Tuesday for the unveiling of his prescription drug plan.</p>
        <p>''We're trying to be agile and flexible and change things around as we go,'' one Bush aide said.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bush is already deep into  debate preparation. Last Monday, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a close Republican ally of Mr. Bush's, visited Austin in his role as the stand-in for Mr. Gore in rehearsals, one of Mr. Bush's advisers said.</p>
        <p>The adviser said that Mr. Gregg and Mr. Bush did not actually position themselves at lecterns or simulate the formal trappings of a debate, but practiced some of the back-and-forth exchanges that would probably occur between the candidates.</p>
        <p>Amid all this activity, Mr. Rove's use of the phrase ''an appropriate way'' to describe how Mr. Bush would distinguish himself from Mr. Gore pointed to a potential problem for the Bush campaign as it gets more aggressive.</p>
        <p>Sharp attacks on Mr. Gore could come across as a hypocritical contradiction of Mr. Bush's pledge to ''change the tone'' of politics.</p>
        <p>But Republican officials said that pitches like the one used in last week's commercial -- which mocked Mr. Gore's appearance in 1996 at a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple and his boasts about a role in creating the Internet -- had tested well with independent-minded, swing voters in focus groups conducted by the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Bush, in an interview on Friday, hinted that there was plenty more ammunition against Mr. Gore. ''There's a lot of different things we could have used,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was on a day trip to Louisiana and Arkansas that reflected the campaign's ongoing analysis of the electoral map. Neither of those states belongs firmly to either candidate.</p>
        <p>The governor's advisers expected him to dominate elsewhere in the South and will focus most strongly on Florida, where Mr. Gore was mounting a strong challenge. Its 25 electoral votes are the the nation's fourth-richest prize, behind California and New York, where Mr. Gore should prevail, and Texas, which is a cinch for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bush will visit California next week and his advisers want to force Mr. Gore to spend time and money there, their only  genuine hope on the West Coast seems to be Washington.</p>
        <p>The Northeast, with the exceptions of New Hampshire and possibly Maine, is also a stronghold for Mr. Gore, which leaves the states in or abutting the Midwest as the most intense war zone.</p>
        <p>His advisers regard Indiana as an almost sure win, and Ohio and Missouri as likely victories that need tending. As these advisers seem to see it, Illinois and Minnesota are likely losses, although Illinois will get some attention.</p>
        <p>Wisconsin and Iowa are possibilities. And then come Michigan and Pennsylvania, ripe with electoral votes. Mr. Bush will pass through both of these states more than once this week, along with visits to Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana.</p>
        <p>In terms of events, the Bush campaign plans to extend to other issues its practice of introducing middle-class families who would benefit from his proposed tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will probably stand alongside older Americans who prefer his prescription drug plan to Mr. Gore's and people in their 20's or 30's who like his call for the option of private investment accounts within the Social Security system.</p>
        <p>But several of his advisers acknowledged that Mr. Bush's message had to transcend -- and, in a sense, trump -- policy details, because polls show that more voters see Mr. Gore's positions on issues as compatible to their own.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Bush will assert that no matter where Mr. Gore stands, he cannot deliver, because he lacks the ability to forge bipartisan cooperation. And Mr. Bush will talk, as he has since last year, about Mr. Gore's prescriptions as the reflections of a man who believes in government as the font of all wisdom and his own remedies as a gesture of faith in people.</p>
        <p>''I think if it got to be about specific issue positions, you're playing on Gore's turf,'' one adviser to the Bush campaign said of the upcoming election. ''But if you make issues about broader realities and broader dynamics, you're on our turf.''</p>
