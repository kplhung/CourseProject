        <p>Under the Sun  His real name was Claude Gelee or Gellee. He said his date of birth was 1600. Perhaps it was 1606. What is certain is that this French expatriate, who spent most of his life in Rome, is among the greatest of landscape painters. His brilliance echoes through history under the name Claude Lorrain. Beginning tomorrow in recognition of what tradition records as the 400th anniversary of his birth (he died in 1682), the Morgan Library will pay him tribute in ''Claude and the Ideal Landscape.'' This exhibition of some 40 of his drawings of rustic buildings, rivers and panoramas, assembled from the Morgan's extensive holdings, as well as those of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and private collectors, continues through Oct. 29. Information: (212) 685-0610.</p>

        <p>Under the Sun  His real name was Claude Gelee or Gellee. He said his date of birth was 1600. Perhaps it was 1606. What is certain is that this French expatriate, who spent most of his life in Rome, is among the greatest of landscape painters. His brilliance echoes through history under the name Claude Lorrain.

Information: (212) 685-0610.</p>
        <p>Puppet Parade  In its simplest terms, it's the world on a string. Held every two years, the event is the fifth Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater, which is bringing 26 companies from around the globe for 200 performances on 14 stages in New York from Wednesday through Sept. 24. Featuring 146 artists and more than 600 puppets, troupes will present works for adults and children. Information: (212) 439-7556.</p>
        <p>Jeweler's Art  Drawing on the holdings of the King of Sweden, the Duke of Westminster and private collections around the world, as well as those of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the Forbes Magazine Collection in New York, a major display of the works of the master jeweler and goldsmith Peter Carl Faberge opens on Saturday at the Riverfront Arts Center in Wilmington, Del. Among the  works in ''Faberge'' are six of the Easter eggs he designed in his role as jeweler for the imperial family in czarist Russia. The  exhibition continues through Feb. 18. Information: (302) 777-1600 or (888) 395-0005.</p>
        <p>Footworks  With some things old and some things new, the Dance Theater of Harlem, under the artistic direction of Arthur Mitchell and in its 31st season, opens a 13-performance engagement on Wednesday at City Center. Through Sept. 17, its four programs embody classics, like a restaged Act II of ''Creole Giselle,'' the pas de deux from ''Romeo and Juliet,'' ''A Song for Dead Warriors,'' ''Medea'' and works created especially for Dance Theater of Harlem, like ''Return,'' ''Twist'' and ''South African Suite.'' Information: (212) 690-2800.</p>
