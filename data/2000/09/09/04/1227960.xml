        <p>At the height of the Internet land rush in 1998, an unusual story stood out from the rest: the tiny nation of Tuvalu sold, for $50 million, the rights to its chunk of cyberspace. Tuvalu, a string of islands halfway between Hawaii and Australia with a population of just 10,600, had rarely made world headlines. But the multimillion-dollar sale, to an ambitious Web entrepreneur in Canada, changed all that.</p>
        <p>The story really began when Tuvalu, along with dozens of other nations and territories, was assigned its own two-letter suffix that signifies an Internet domain. Under the assignment, Britain received .uk; France, .fr; and Tuvalu, by chance, .tv.</p>
        <p>Into this picture came Jason Chapnik, a 28-year-old entrepreneur from Toronto. Mr. Chapnik says he came up with the idea of registering names within the .tv domain as early as 1994.</p>
        <p>''We started brainstorming,'' Mr. Chapnik recalled in a telephone interview from his home. ''If we could have dot-anything, what would we want? We made lists -- dot-info, dot-law. Once we hit on dot-tv as a concept, we knew we had it.''</p>
        <p>But getting the rights to the .tv domain from Tuvalu would not be easy. Mr. Chapnik sent written proposals and spent months researching and making contacts with the Tuvalu government. By 1997, other people had come up with the same idea. By 1998, the Tuvalu government had narrowed the prospects down to three companies. So Mr. Chapnik and his wife, Jodi, took a vacation and went to the islands to make their pitch. In the fall of 1998, after months of negotiation, Tuvalu made its decision.</p>
        <p>''I think my wife won it for us,'' Mr. Chapnik said. ''Family is very important to them. Coming down with my wife and not business partners spoke volumes to them.''</p>
        <p>A few months later, Mr. Chapnik secured millions in backing from a leading Internet incubator, Idealab, which provided expertise and the capital needed to pay Tuvalu and build the business.</p>
        <p>Under the deal, Tuvalu is to receive the $50 million over the next 12 years. Already, the company has paid the country $18 million. The payments so far have increased the country's gross domestic product by 50 percent and allowed the government to put electricity on the outer islands and create scholarships for its citizens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chapnik had succeeded at turning his idea into a viable Internet business company, dotTV, which is now 50 percent owned by Idealab.</p>
        <p>The company's business plan is simple. It wants to be the next Network Solutions. As the wholesaler to the registrars of .com, .net and .org, Network Solutions made millions registering Internet addresses, largely because of the aura of the popular .com domain.</p>
        <p>DotTV believes it can have the same kind of success with its domain, which it says is made up of the most recognizable two letters on the planet.</p>
        <p>The company, which has its own site at www.tv, registers addresses on its Web site and through third parties like Dotster and GreatDomains.com. Most prices start at $100. Words and letter combinations with higher perceived value, like call letters of a television station, are auctioned off, starting at $1,000. Three names -- free.tv, china.tv and net.tv -- have each sold for $100,000, the company said last month.</p>
        <p>The company's most recent success involved the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, which agreed to relocate from emmys.org and emmycast.com to emmys.tv. It also sold .tv domains to the Pax broadcast network.</p>
        <p>''This is an industry that is exploding,'' said Craig Francis, dotTV's chief operating officer. ''Even at $100 a pop, which is what most names go for,'' he added, ''this has the potential to be very profitable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Francis would not say how many names had been sold so far, only that it was in the tens of thousands.</p>
        <p>To sell more names, dotTV is trying to make the .tv domain synonymous with ''rich'' media on the Web,  singling out organizations that will use video, audio and interactive features on their sites.</p>
        <p>''Right now there is this fundamental shift in the Internet from static text to rich and engaging information that is much more television-like,'' Mr. Francis said. ''We want the .tv domain to tell people that this is what a site is doing.''</p>
        <p>But achieving .com-like status for the new domain could still prove a challenge.</p>
        <p>Clay Shirky, a partner at Accelerator Group, a consulting firm that works with Web start-ups, says the company's plan is based on the scarcity of commercially available domain names -- a scarcity that he says is not going to last.</p>
        <p>''It is true that most of the 'good' .com names have been taken,'' Mr. Shirky said. ''But the crash of the Internet market has cooled people's desire to pay buckets of cash for an easy-to-remember domain name.''</p>
        <p>Adding to dotTV's hurdles, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, the international group charged with administering the domain-name system, plans to release a set of new domains, which might include suffixes like .web, .store and .sex, early next year.</p>
        <p>So far, the only clear winner is Tuvalu. With some of the money it earned in the dotTV deal, it has financed the process to join the United Nations. Tomorrow at the United Nations, the organization will have a flag-raising ceremony for Tuvalu.</p>
        <p>Koloa Talake, chairman of the nation's public sector reform program and a member of the board of dotTV, is quick to see a connection.</p>
        <p>''The world's recognition of Tuvalu as an independent country has been made possible by the relationship with dotTV,'' he said, adding that the company was helping Tuvalu ''get into the 21st century.''</p>
