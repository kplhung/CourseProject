        <p>Editorial extols the short few weeks after Labor Day that constitute a season all their own, not quite summer and not quite fall</p>

        <p>Sometimes it seems as though summer is just three days long: Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day. Where the rest of summer goes is anyone's guess, but such is the headlong life we live. Summer was once an endless tract of time. Now, there is one day to set out the lawn furniture, one day to sprawl on it, and one day to put it away and get out the Christmas tree stand while you're at it. The last of those days has come. The ark of one's leisure is about to run aground. The September fashion bibles -- fat as phone books -- are already on the newsstand. School buses are already on the road. A chill is in the air, or so they are saying somewhere much farther north.</p>
        <p>But Labor Day is really the beginning of a short season all its own, an in-between time, a month of not-quite-summer, not-yet-fall. That season, whatever you call it, often feels more like the new year than the New Year itself -- new books, new exhibitions, new music, new commitments, and never mind that it has all been in the planning for months. The city is full again and no longer in dishabille. The leaves are still green. None of the races, pennant or political, have been run to the wire just yet. Night closes in on both ends of day, and still on fair evenings the light seems to linger. The subways begin to exhale.</p>

        <p>Sometimes it seems as though summer is just three days long: Memorial Day, Independence Day and Labor Day. Where the rest of summer goes is anyone's guess, but such is the headlong life we live. Summer was once an endless tract of time. Now, there is one day to set out the lawn furniture, one day to sprawl on it, and one day to put it away and get out the Christmas tree stand while you're at it. The last of those days has come. The ark of one's leisure is about to run aground. The September fashion bibles -- fat as phone books -- are already on the newsstand. School buses are already on the road. A chill is in the air, or so they are saying somewhere much farther north.</p>
        <p>But Labor Day is really the beginning of a short season all its own, an in-between time, a month of not-quite-summer, not-yet-fall. That season, whatever you call it, often feels more like the new year than the New Year itself -- new books, new exhibitions, new music, new commitments, and never mind that it has all been in the planning for months. The city is full again and no longer in dishabille. The leaves are still green. None of the races, pennant or political, have been run to the wire just yet. Night closes in on both ends of day, and still on fair evenings the light seems to linger. The subways begin to exhale.</p>
        <p>Somehow, in this strange, short season, the days seem to flock together, as if they were about to begin their migration, like a flight of doves. There are only a few weeks before fall is really here and summer is indisputably absorbed into the past. Perhaps what makes the short season after Labor Day so pleasing is the fact that we catch only glimpses of it on the fly.</p>
        <p>This is the time we should take off from work -- only we never do -- to watch summer and fall collide, to feel the sharp nights and the warm days, to walk through a garden that is ripening and dying all at once. In the country, a morning will come soon enough when all the gnats have disappeared, a sign that this short season is over.</p>
