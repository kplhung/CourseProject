        <p>New York City has long held a special place in American life as a metropolis that perpetually renews itself with waves of foreign immigration. That has never been truer than today, when the city is brimming with newly arrived residents. At the end of a decade in which one million newcomers swept into the city, 40 percent of New Yorkers are now foreign-born, the highest level since 1910. The city is enriched by the immigrants, but it also faces major challenges in helping to integrate them fully into the life and economy of the city.</p>
        <p>The earlier generations of immigrants who passed through Ellis Island were largely from Europe. The fastest-growing groups these days are from South Asia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and the nations born of the breakup of the Soviet Union. In Queens alone 167 nationalities and 116 languages coexist. That variety is one of New York's most distinctive traits. While other cities tend to attract immigrants primarily from one or two foreign regions, New York is a magnet for the whole world. The immigrants come because of the city's reputation as a point of entry and the presence of friends and relatives.</p>

        <p>New York City has long held a special place in American life as a metropolis that perpetually renews itself with waves of foreign immigration. That has never been truer than today, when the city is brimming with newly arrived residents. At the end of a decade in which one million newcomers swept into the city, 40 percent of New Yorkers are now foreign-born, the highest level since 1910. The city is enriched by the immigrants, but it also faces major challenges in helping to integrate them fully into the life and economy of the city.</p>
        <p>The earlier generations of immigrants who passed through Ellis Island were largely from Europe. The fastest-growing groups these days are from South Asia, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and the nations born of the breakup of the Soviet Union. In Queens alone 167 nationalities and 116 languages coexist. That variety is one of New York's most distinctive traits. While other cities tend to attract immigrants primarily from one or two foreign regions, New York is a magnet for the whole world. The immigrants come because of the city's reputation as a point of entry and the presence of friends and relatives.</p>
        <p>If it were not for immigration, the city's population would be decreasing today. The newcomers culturally and economically revitalize abandoned neighborhoods, and their presence bolsters the economy and contributes to the tax base. But the surge has also brought a slew of challenges. Many immigrants do not speak English, and long lines of people are turned away from the too-few English classes sponsored by nonprofit organizations and community colleges. The inability to speak English keeps immigrants in very low-paying jobs. Many Mexican and Dominican immigrants, for instance, earn less than $20,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a shortage of affordably priced housing has led to overcrowding in poor areas. It is not uncommon in some Bronx neighborhoods for four or more people to live in a single room. Schools are also inadequate in these neighborhoods, with enrollments straining already sparse resources.</p>
        <p>Because newly arrived immigrants are not eligible to vote -- and turnout is low among those who have become citizens -- many of these problems do not receive the attention they deserve from political leaders. Naturalized citizens should be encouraged to register to vote, and local politicians need to make more effort to reach out to these traditionally ignored populations. In addition, immigrants are often unaware of the programs that do exist to help them. Public housing aid and child health insurance, for example, are not widely used by immigrants who are eligible for them. Many immigrants use emergency medical care but also rely on unlicensed community clinics, in part because they are unaware of the dangers associated with such clinics.</p>
        <p>Poverty rates among immigrant populations are high, and if current problems are allowed to grow, they could lead to a permanent underclass of immigrants. With the city's foreign-born population expected to grow even larger in the years ahead, the health of the city will depend in no small measure on how successfully it absorbs its newest residents.</p>
