      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Joan Claybrook (Public Citizen) says Congress bears much of responsibility for late response of National Highway Traffic Sarety Administration to Firestone tire blowouts and resulting rollovers of Ford Explorers; cites Reagan-era cuts in agency's budgets and Congressional interference on behalf of industry in safety recall cases (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>As Congress begins hearings this week on the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, questions will be raised about why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn't take action sooner against Firestone and the Ford Motor Company over tire blowouts and resulting rollovers of Ford Explorers.</p>
        <p>One answer is the agency's budget, now more than 30 percent lower in real dollars than it was in 1980. A 50 percent cut during the Reagan administration still hampers the agency's capacity to regulate an ever-growing automobile industry. Congressional interference on behalf of industry in safety recall cases has also shackled the regulators, and they lack needed authority to police automakers.</p>

        <p>As Congress begins hearings this week on the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, questions will be raised about why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration didn't take action sooner against Firestone and the Ford Motor Company over tire blowouts and resulting rollovers of Ford Explorers.</p>
        <p>One answer is the agency's budget, now more than 30 percent lower in real dollars than it was in 1980. A 50 percent cut during the Reagan administration still hampers the agency's capacity to regulate an ever-growing automobile industry. Congressional interference on behalf of industry in safety recall cases has also shackled the regulators, and they lack needed authority to police automakers.</p>
        <p>When it is time to drop the enforcement hammer, the safety agency can strike only lightly. The maximum penalty it can impose on Firestone or Ford is $925,000 for refusal to recall  products. The penalty for withholding a document is a pitiful $l,000, no matter how long it is withheld. And there are no federal criminal penalties for these violations, regardless of how many people are killed by a company's reckless behavior. The agency sent legislation to Congress in March to increase penalties, but the proposal for a maximum of $4 million in fines is still far too low to ensure deterrence of large corporations.</p>
        <p>The agency's standards for tires and the strength of automobile roofs are 30 years old. Existing tests for roofs are virtually useless in protecting occupants in rollovers.</p>
        <p>Over and over, the auto industry has succeeded in stopping strong safety measures like a rollover prevention standard and my proposal for tire inflation indicators on dashboards. Ford and Firestone now argue that consumers helped cause the current problem by not properly inflating Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Would these standards and legislative authority have prevented this disaster? Absolutely. But the agency must also be more proactive: seeking information about defects from repair shops, fleet owners, insurance companies, and lawyers for crash victims; issuing consumer alerts about possible defects and gathering facts from the public; and using its subpoena power to prevent the auto industry from withholding information.</p>
        <p>When regulation of automobile safety is hampered or lax, the public pays the ultimate price.</p>
