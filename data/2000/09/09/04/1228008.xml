        <p>It was an unusual preseason for the Giants' defensive players, who occasionally found themselves being asked if they could keep up with the improved and surging Giants' offense.</p>
        <p>''We weren't as worried about us as everybody else seemed to be,'' Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead said today. ''I knew we'd come out strong.''</p>
        <p>Armstead spoke in the wake of the Giants' 21-16 victory over Arizona, a game in which the Giants' defense didn't dominate the wounded Cardinals, but overwhelmed them early and held on. In the fourth quarter, Arizona scored two touchdowns -- one in the final minute -- to cut into an 18-point Giants lead.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't perfect and we're still learning to play together,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said. ''But we played well. And we won.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' defensive effort was a mixture of strong and average performances. On the one hand, the Giants' defensive front four completely stuffed the Cardinals' running game. But the same defensive linemen did not pressure Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer, who was not sacked and was rarely harried in the pocket.</p>
        <p>The Giants' linebackers contributed to help stop the run, but according to Giants Coach Jim Fassel were responsible for some of the 28 passes Plummer completed.</p>
        <p>And the Giants' secondary, which many feared would be the easiest unit to attack, generally had a strong game, although it gave up two late touchdown passes from Plummer to wide receiver David Boston. Plummer threw for 318 yards.</p>
        <p>''I was disappointed at the end and with the way we went out at the end of the game,'' Fassel said. ''But our defense had to play with an attitude -- an attitude that took command. And until the very end, they did that. There are things to work on, but I thought they did a lot right.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' defensive front made the early statement, as Arizona's top draft pick, running back Thomas Jones, found out. He gained 2 yards in his first rushing carry, then lost a yard in each of his next two rushes. By halftime, with Jones totaling 1 yard on 6 carries, the Cardinals had all but abandoned their running game.</p>
        <p>''We may have given up a lot of passing yards,'' said Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn, who led the Giants in tackles with eight. ''But that's just because that's all they were doing in the second half. They're going to get some passes completed if they throw it 50-something times.</p>
        <p>''But for a defense, it's an accomplishment if you can throw them completely off balance. You can contain most teams if they're only trying to move the ball one way. And that's what our defensive line did in this game.''</p>
        <p>Fassel conceded that the Giants will have to find ways to get a pass rush from the front four. The Giants occasionally blitzed their linebackers, but still didn't succeed in getting to Plummer.</p>
        <p>The Giants' new middle linebacker, Mike Barrow, had six unassisted tackles and a fumble recovery. His presence on a stunt standing over Arizona center Chris Dishman probably led to the fumble of the snap between Dishman and Plummer in what was a key turnover. The Cardinals were at the Giants' 13-yard line, trying to convert on a fourth and 1. The Giants led, 14-0, at the time.</p>
        <p>''What I liked about that is that we were being aggressive,'' Fassel said. ''They were going for it on fourth down and we were going back at them.''</p>
        <p>In the secondary, while the Cardinals frequently went after left cornerback Dave Thomas, it was not an especially fruitful tactic. Sehorn, meanwhile, was steady and broke up a long pass down the sideline intended for Boston.</p>
        <p>Nickel cornerback Emmanuel McDaniel had two interceptions, including one late in the first half that halted another Cardinals drive into Giants territory. Shaun Williams, making his first start at free safety for the Giants, intercepted Plummer midway through the third quarter, again as Arizona was driving toward the Giants' goal line.</p>
        <p>''We played with a lot of balance,'' said Armstead, who was already talking about next week's opponent, Philadelphia, which scored 41 points in defeating Dallas today. ''We've got things to work on. But we did what we had to. And we won.''</p>
