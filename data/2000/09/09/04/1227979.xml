        <p>Some Unexplored Options For a Missile Defense  The debate about a national missile defense system has obscured the potential candidacy of a lesser-known antimissile weapon known as the theater missile defense system, designed to protect American troops and bases in relatively small regions. Theater missile defense systems potentially could be expanded to protect larger areas and perhaps even the entire United States, analysts inside and outside the military say.</p>

        <p>Strong Challenger in Yugoslavia  In the race for president, polls suggest that the moderate nationalist Vojislav Kostunica, the most serious opposition candidate ever to challenge Slobodan Milosevic, ought to be able to win. The election is being closely watched by the United States and NATO, which bombed Yugoslavia for 78 days last year over Kosovo and have labored since to push Mr. Milosevic out of office.</p>

        <p>U.S. Voice for U.N. Support  With President Clinton preparing to visit New York this week for a meeting of world leaders at the United Nations, the American ambassador, Richard C. Holbrooke, said that the United States must focus more on its relations with the organization, which he called ''indispensable'' to American foreign policy.</p>

        <p>Shaking Lebanon's Status Quo  Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri dealt a crushing electoral blow to the country's Syrian-appointed government led by Salim al-Hoss in final parliamentary voting, early results showed, sweeping all of Beirut's seats and gaining a powerful majority of backers in Parliament.</p>

        <p>Japan Displays Its Troops  More than 7,000 uniformed soldiers participated in an earthquake preparedness drill in central Tokyo. Critics called it a public relations operation for the military, saying that many politicians would choose to revise the Constitution to allow Japan to field a full-fledged army for the first time since its defeat in 1945.</p>

        <p>Bush Offers Debate Dates And Tries to Turn Tables  Trying to end questions about his willingness to debate and turn the tables on his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush announced a schedule of three hand-picked debates that he wanted to do, only one of which is guaranteed to be broadcast on the three major networks. Mr. Bush pointedly challenged Vice President Al Gore to meet him on these chosen dates and terms. His idea drew an immediate reaction from Mr. Gore, who said he was ''very disappointed.''</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore begins the fall stretch of the presidential campaign buoyant in the polls and brimming with confidence. But the Gore team's newfound euphoria is tempered with caution.</p>
        <p>A14</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman kicked off a round-the-clock Labor Day campaign swing designed to portray them as the ticket for the working class.</p>

        <p>More Immigrants in Work Force  The percentage of immigrant workers in the nation's labor force has climbed to its highest level in seven decades. This influx -- immigrants now represent 12 percent of the nation's workers -- is having profound effects on the work force and the economy, helping hold down wages in unskilled jobs and giving many companies the employees needed to expand. Immigration analysts estimate that nearly 5 million of these workers are illegal immigrants.</p>

        <p>What War-Ready Means  The 49th Armored Division of the Texas National Guard -- nominally under Gov. George W. Bush's command -- has the lowest ranking for wartime readiness that the Pentagon gives, according to military officials. It has been that way for the last three years. But just as the Pentagon disputes that its active-duty forces are not ready for combat, the 49th Guard division's case reveals a far more difficult question about the overall state of the American military today. It involves an arcane, sometimes subjective readiness accounting system that can be misleading and is not easily reduced to the sound bites of a presidential campaign.</p>

        <p>Quake Reveals New Fault Line  An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2 rattled Northern California's wine country, taking place along a previously undiscovered fault line and surprising seismologists.</p>

        <p>Movie Theaters Build Themselves Into a Corner  The two new theaters facing each other on 42nd Street near Eighth Avenue offer stadium seating and the latest digital sound technology. Together, they have 38 screens and more than 8,100 seats. But analysts say they are signs of an industry in trouble, with too much building and not enough hits to go around.</p>

        <p>A Question of Money  In the three months since the New Jersey primaries, Representative Robert D. Franks, the little-known Republican candidate for United States Senate, has managed to raise just over $1 million. Jon S. Corzine will spend more than that on television commercials this week. That blunt contrast, more than anything else, is shaping the fall campaign.</p>

        <p>Tighter Tire Standards Scuttled  After the last huge Firestone recall in 1978, when tread separation problems resulted in hundreds of crashes and dozens of deaths, Congress and regulators recommended a series of proposals to tighten federal tire standards. But the rules were never revised and many of the same problems have arisen again in the Firestone tires being recalled today.</p>
