        <p>Like college students pulling an all-nighter together, Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman today kicked off a round-the-clock Labor Day campaign swing designed to portray them as the ticket for the working class.</p>
        <p>On the holiday weekend traditionally seen as the start of the stretch run to the November election, Mr. Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, continued the populist themes on which he has based his general election run.</p>
        <p>''The key difference in this election is we're for the people, they're for the powerful,'' he told 100 cheering construction workers in the unfinished Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman set a grueling schedule from this afternoon through Monday night.</p>
        <p>Dubbed ''Al and Joe's Hard Day's Night Tour'' by the campaign, it aimed to cram as many appearances in as many swing-state media markets as possible into a little more than 24 hours.</p>
        <p>They flew here together from Philadelphia for a rally at the airport and a late-night meeting with hospital workers at Hurley Medical Center. From here they were to fly to Tampa, Fla., where they planned a predawn visit to an all-night diner, followed by breakfast with firefighters and a rally at a firehouse.</p>
        <p>From there, they planned to double back to the North.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was scheduled to join a Labor Day celebration in Pittsburgh, and end his day with another Labor Day event in Louisville, Ky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman was booked to fly from Tampa to Detroit on Monday morning for an A.F.L.-C.I.O. event, take in a game of the minor league Mud Hens team in Toledo, then wrap up the marathon in Peoria, Ill.</p>
        <p>''I'm beginning to think that vice-presidential candidates should have collective bargaining rights,'' Mr. Lieberman said of the pace. ''You know, this guy's working me.''</p>
        <p>After stopping at Pat's, a well-known cheese steak restaurant in Philadelphia, Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman made their way to the dusty construction site, which leaked water in a driving rain. They addressed a carefully screened group of construction workers -- some work on the project, some do not -- and tried out the campaign's theme for the week, stewardship of the economy.</p>
        <p>''If you want a job done right, have it done by union workers,'' Mr. Gore said. ''If you want a job done right on our economic policy, take a look at the blueprint. There are two competing blueprints.''</p>
        <p>The Democratic plan, he said, would mean a balanced budget, securing Social Security and Medicare, investing in education, and tax cuts aimed at the middle class.</p>
        <p>''I will not accept the blueprint from the other side,'' he said, ''that proposes to give away all the surplus in a giant tax cut to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, that stops our prosperity and progress.</p>
        <p>''We tried the other side's approach before, and you saw what happened eight years ago, with the high unemployment and the big deficits.''</p>
        <p>Some workers at the event said they knew little about politics or economic policy, beyond the remarkable growth they have seen under President Clinton and Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Patrick Stafford, 21, an electrician, said, ''Clinton did a real good job with the economy, and Gore was his V.P., so he's the next-best thing to Clinton if we can't have Clinton. Also, Gore's pro-union and Bush isn't.''</p>
