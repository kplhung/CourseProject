        <p>Larry Brown was reminiscing recently about a much simpler time in international competition, when an Olympic basketball player for the United States had no one to carry his bags during training camp in Hawaii, when you could not order coconut shrimp as an appetizer.</p>
        <p>''Nobody in '64 had ever been to Hawaii that I know of,'' said Brown, an assistant coach with the 2000 team and in 1964 a point guard for Hank Iba's Olympic team that played in Tokyo, which also featured Bill Bradley, Walt Hazzard and Jim Barnes.</p>

        <p>Larry Brown was reminiscing recently about a much simpler time in international competition, when an Olympic basketball player for the United States had no one to carry his bags during training camp in Hawaii, when you could not order coconut shrimp as an appetizer.</p>
        <p>''Nobody in '64 had ever been to Hawaii that I know of,'' said Brown, an assistant coach with the 2000 team and in 1964 a point guard for Hank Iba's Olympic team that played in Tokyo, which also featured Bill Bradley, Walt Hazzard and Jim Barnes.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't like we got bags, jackets, shirts and shoes like this group,'' he said. ''In '64, they hit us with a lei, put us on a military bus and drove us to Pearl Harbor. We stayed in the enlisted men's quarters, which was one big room. We ate in the military mess hall, cafeteria-style.''</p>
        <p>Brown has always been skilled at delivering in-my-day rants, going on about the hardships and realities of old-school players. But he is especially good today.</p>
        <p>''To wake us up, they came in with a garbage can and a shovel and banged on it,'' Brown said. ''That was our alarm clock. We got on a bus to the Marine base, where we practiced on an open court. The top was covered, but the sides were open. We had two-a-day practices.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Iba didn't have a curfew, but there was no way were going. We were too tired. Besides, they had one of those military-police guys with a gun if you wanted to leave. We were there for 31 straight days. We had a half a day off where we were allowed to go to the other side of the island if we wanted to swim or surf. A half-day in 31 days. That was my Hawaiian experience.''</p>
        <p>Ray Allen and Allan Houston overheard Brown and shook their heads in disbelief. They and 10 teammates resided at a five-star Maui hotel for more than a week. If they wanted, butlers drew orchid baths for $50. The pool bar had some concoction called a Lava Flow that was more dessert than drink.</p>
        <p>These are not college kids who have never been abroad. They are multimillionaire basketball players, living large in paradise. They work hard, they play hard. It is the only way Olympic officials could get National Basketball Association All-Stars to come. Private charters, bell men and concierges are all they have known since they turned pro.</p>
        <p>Allen Iverson would like it here.</p>
        <p>''I would have loved for him to be here,'' Brown said of Iverson, the Philadelphia 76ers point guard with whom he seems to be locked in an eternal power struggle. ''Allen needs something like this.''</p>
        <p>The story of the old-school coach and the Slam magazine point guard trying to coexist is already collecting dust. Iverson takes a day off, Brown blows up, trade rumors swirl and, in usually less than a week, they make up and promise to do right by each other. Just as Brown's patience has reached its threshold, the education of Iverson continues. For better or worse -- or until a megadeal does them part -- this is the dance they do.</p>
        <p>But even across the Pacific Ocean, you can see the worry in Brown's eyes. After all the skipped practices and insurrections, he does not want to see Iverson, one of the most talented players in the world, waste his gift.</p>
        <p>''I'm not asking him to do anything that any other coach wouldn't ask a player to do,'' said Brown, who said he had not spoken to Iverson over the summer. ''What he said to other players and our management is that he wants to do all those things. It's a nonissue if he does. If he doesn't, there's no hope.''</p>
        <p>No hope?</p>
        <p>''It's irreconcilable if he doesn't show up to practice,'' Brown said. ''I'll lose my whole team. You ask any one of our players. Anybody that works for you, if they're constantly late, or they don't show up or they don't want to work. If he does the right things, we got no problem.</p>
        <p>''I've never criticized his game or his heart. But he tells me he wants to be the leader, the captain and a great player. And my response to him is: 'You've got control over all that. Not me.' If any player on any team did the things that have happened in the past with him, you got no chance. I'm hopeful that's over.''</p>
        <p>Brown will attend his team's N.B.A. training camp the day after he returns from the Games in Sydney, Australia, just as many of the Olympians will. Unless a trade is swung before then, there Brown will meet up with Iverson. He will try not to sound like the father who tells his son how many miles he had to walk to school in the snow.</p>
        <p>But this is a pivotal juncture in the career of Iverson. A bit of history may be what the future needs.</p>
        <p>''I've always felt his hope would be around Patrick or Alonzo or Karl Malone,'' Brown said, citing Patrick Ewing and Alonzo Mourning. ''It's about pitting him with a guy that has so much respect for the game and has accomplished so much and is so professional. He needs to see that.</p>
        <p>''Our guys are professional and I have as many warriors on my team as anybody in the league -- respect the game, respect your teammates -- but they don't have the reputation or the credentials that Zo, Malone or Patrick would have. To have them to say something to him or to show him the right way is really meaningful. I feel bad he hasn't been exposed to that.''</p>
