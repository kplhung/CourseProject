        <p>Trying to ignite viewer interest in ''Big Brother,'' the CBS reality television show whose ratings have paled in comparison with those of CBS's summer runaway hit, ''Survivor,'' the producers plan to pay one of the six remaining contestants $10,000 to quit this week, allowing the show to introduce a fresh face.</p>
        <p>The producers hope that the new entrant into the camera-filled house, where the contestants have been confined for eight weeks, will be dynamic enough to instill some dramatic tension into the occupants' personal relationships.

        <p>Trying to ignite viewer interest in ''Big Brother,'' the CBS reality television show whose ratings have paled in comparison with those of CBS's summer runaway hit, ''Survivor,'' the producers plan to pay one of the six remaining contestants $10,000 to quit this week, allowing the show to introduce a fresh face.</p>
        <p>The producers hope that the new entrant into the camera-filled house, where the contestants have been confined for eight weeks, will be dynamic enough to instill some dramatic tension into the occupants' personal relationships. Dramatic tension is an element the producers -- and apparently most viewers -- have found distressingly absent from ''Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>Or at least from the American ''Big Brother.'' Unlike the contestants in versions of the show in other parts of the world, the American participants are overly aware that they are on television, the producers said. Also, American viewers seem unwilling to accept contestants who stray from mainstream values or opinions.</p>
        <p>''It is definitely frustrating and confounding,'' said Douglas Ross, one of the show's executive producers. ''Will and Jordan and Karen and Brittany have given us some great television.'' But they are the four contestants the audience decided to eliminate. (The house's members nominate two potential losers for the audience to vote on in elections held every other week.)</p>
        <p>Left with six contestants who the producers say seem to be doing everything possible to appear inoffensive, the show's creators have decided to ''introduce a new impulse,'' said Paul Romer, the producer from the Dutch company Endemol, which developed ''Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>So on Wednesday night the contestants will be presented with a briefcase filled with $10,000 and given two minutes to decide whether one of them will take the money and run. (The ultimate winner of the game will receive $500,000.) What they will not know is that if a contestant does leave, Beth, a 22-year-old from Florida and a former alternate for ''Big Brother,'' will enter the house as a replacement. (The producers revealed no other personal details about Beth, other than Mr. Ross's observation that she was ''very attractive.'')</p>
        <p>This move has always been an option because the rules allow anyone voluntarily exiting the game to be replaced. The producers are resorting to the strategy, which CBS agreed to after some initial reluctance, to stir up some conflict in a group in which seldom is heard a discouraging word. Although the producers say they are confident that someone will take the $10,000, if no one volunteers -- or if the contestants cannot decide among themselves -- they will withdraw the money and probably offer it again later.</p>
        <p>In another departure from the European versions of ''Big Brother,'' no one here has volunteered to quit. ''It's something in the American mentality,'' Mr. Romer said. ''You don't want to be seen as a quitter.''</p>
        <p>That mentality seems to have affected ''Big Brother'' in other ways, too, beginning with the extreme media awareness of the United States contestants. ''In the American house, our contestants never forget they're on camera,'' Mr. Romer said. ''In Europe they stopped thinking of the cameras very quickly.''</p>
        <p>The American group, Mr. Ross added, ''are all trying to produce themselves.''</p>
        <p>The American show also has much less sexual tension than the other versions. ''Europeans have seen people hooking up in the house,'' Mr. Romer said. ''Americans are a little more prudish. Nudity is a bigger issue here.'' Indeed, in the German version one female contestant courted popularity by flashing her breasts on camera ''every 10 minutes,'' Mr. Romer said.</p>
        <p>''That would be a bit of a problem on CBS,'' he observed.</p>
        <p>But nothing has stunned the producers more than the vote last week to dump Brittany Petros, a 25-year-old pharmaceutical saleswoman from Minneapolis, distinguished on the show by her avowed virginity and her hair's changing colors (including purple and green). She had previously won an online contest as the most popular occupant of the house, but in the recent audience telephone election to dismiss someone, she easily received the most votes.</p>
        <p>''We were very surprised,'' Mr. Romer said. ''But maybe the audience felt she was too out of the mainstream.''</p>
        <p>That certainly seems to be what Ms. Petros believes. ''It's got to be the older people who didn't like the chick with green hair on TV maybe becoming a role model,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' thrived largely because its most overtly scheming character, Richard Hatch, took control of the game; but the audience, which loved to hate Richard, never had a chance to vote him off the island.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure Richard would have been voted out of the house the first week on our show,'' Mr. Romer said.</p>
        <p>And that is clearly a large part of the problem with ''Big Brother.'' American television viewers may love their villains, but if you ask them to vote, they will choose more with their hearts than with their tastes.</p>
        <p>''In a traditional scripted show, audiences get hooked on the villain,'' said Mr. Ross, whose production company, Evolution, has created many other reality shows for American television. ''In reality television, people start to think of the people on the show as their friends, and so they seek to protect their friends from the villain.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Romer said that in all the ''Big Brother'' versions, anyone exhibiting ''antisocial behavior'' was quickly dispatched by the viewers. But in the American version the threat of expulsion seems to hang over anyone who appears the least nonconformist.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the producers should not have been surprised. Tom Smith, the director of the General Social Survey for the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, said that the audience preference for inoffensive personalities on ''Big Brother'' is little different from the conflict-avoidance exemplified by American politics.</p>
        <p>It is the reason, Mr. Smith said, that ''we have two political parties that run to the middle, with both trying to outdo the other in looking more moderate.''</p>
        <p>''We penalize parties and people who are extreme,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bland politicians and, apparently, bland contestants on reality shows like ''Big Brother'' are the results.</p>
        <p>Ms. Petros said that she suspected that her expression of strong opinions had inspired as many people to dislike her as to like her. ''Some of the others are just kind of 'there,' '' she said. ''How can you dislike someone who's just kind of 'there?' ''</p>
        <p>The ''Big Brother'' producers were concerned enough about the lack of a strong personality to propose a radical way to fill the opening that might be created by one contestant walking away with the $10,000. They were going to bring back Jean Jordan, known only as Jordan on the show, the student and former part-time exotic dancer who was kicked off more than a month ago.</p>
        <p>After some negotiation about the terms of her reassignment, the deal fell through.</p>
        <p>If Beth from Florida moves into the house, she will have her work cut out for her. She has not been watching the show because she was so disappointed over not being one of the original choices. And she can probably expect a less than warm welcome. In Europe, every time a new contestant entered the game, he or she was immediately singled out for expulsion by the disgruntled holdover cast members. No replacement contestant has ever won the game.</p>
        <p>Still, the producers believe this move is worth a try. ''We want to give the show more energy,'' Mr. Romer said.</p>
        <p>And if this doesn't work, ''we have more ideas to stir things up,'' he added. ''I'm sure things will start to happen. In the last two or three weeks the prospect of winning the money is there. A lot of scheming will go on.''</p>
