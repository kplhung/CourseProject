        <p>The new grass at Giants Stadium had a shaky National Football League debut. After the portion down the middle of the field was replaced last week, heavy showers Saturday apparently loosened some of the sod. Two gaping pieces came out after a pileup caused by a fumble by Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer late in the first half. One resembled a New York City pothole.</p>
        <p>Officials spent some of their time patching the holes, and the grounds crew tried halftime maintenance. A Giants Stadium worker was tending to the field after fans left.</p>
        <p>''It was coming up,'' Giants offensive lineman Lomas Brown said. ''When they were fighting for that fumble, there were a lot of divots.''</p>
        <p>Tiki Barber had no complaints. He said he loved running on grass after accumulating 144 yards on 13 carries. Barber tore a knee ligament on the old artificial turf here in 1997.</p>
        <p>Fines for Hilliard and Dixon</p>
        <p>Wide receivers Ike Hilliard, a veteran starter, and Ron Dixon, a rookie, missed practice Saturday and will be fined the team maximum. Coach Jim Fassel said the players were staying together and overslept until a team telephone call awoke them. Fassel considered suspending them for the game but did not think that would have been fair to their teammates, and he thought that not starting but playing them would be ceremonial. Fassel discussed his decision with the team captains before announcing the fines. He did not disclose the amount of the fines.</p>
        <p>''I'm not taking it lightly,'' Fassel said. ''I'm not happy with it. They know it.''</p>
        <p>Teams walk through their plays on Saturdays as a final tuneup for the game.</p>
        <p>Garnes Knocked Out</p>
        <p>Safety Sam Garnes sustained a concussion in a fourth-quarter collision with Jessie Armstead and was taken to the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan for tests.</p>
        <p>Armstead's right shoulder hit the left side of Garnes's helmet, and the safety lay face down and motionless on the field for over a minute. Fassel said Garnes lost consciousness for 30 to 40 seconds and was still foggy afterward. He walked to a cart that drove him off the field.</p>
        <p>Longest Run in 41 Years</p>
        <p>Tiki Barber's 78-yard touchdown run was the longest for the Giants since Frank Gifford ran 79 yards against Washington in 1959. Hap Moran's 91-yard run against Green Bay in 1930 is the longest in team history. Eddie Price ran 80 yards at Philadelphia in 1951.</p>
        <p>Another Stormy Day</p>
        <p>The only other lightning delay in Giants Stadium football history occurred in a Jets-Colts game in 1996. Kansas City played host to Seattle and the league's last lightning delay in 1998. . . . The Giants are 4-0 on opening day under Fassel. They have lost the next two games in each of his previous three years.</p>
