        <p>A couple of years ago, a very wealthy couple finished building a very large house in this southern Vermont hamlet.</p>
        <p>It was truly a fine house, built of stone, nearly 13,000 square feet, set on 460 acres near the top of Stonegate Mountain, with panoramic views of verdant Vermont wilderness.</p>
        <p>It was a house so large and so fine, in fact, that when it came time to bill its owners for property tax, the town's Board of Listers, as assessors here are known, put its value at about $6 million, a nearly unheard-of sum in a modest rural state where log cabins are still far more common than starter mansions.</p>
        <p>That's not fair, protested the property owners -- Jim P. Manzi, former head of Lotus Development, whose stock in the company was worth $78 million when I.B.M. bought the business in 1995, and his wife, Glenda -- faced with an annual property tax bill of more than $100,000. (Or rather, their lawyers said it.) The house may have cost nearly $6 million to build, they asserted, but it is so idiosyncratic that no buyer would ever pay so much for it. The value of a property, they argued, is what it would bring on the market. They set the house's value at less than $2 million.</p>
        <p>No, responded the Bridgewater listers. Under a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, cost is a valid measure of such a property's value, they argued; plus, by their calculations, $6 million was close to what recent sales of comparable property indicated the house would bring if sold. An insurance company appraisal also coincided with the $6 million figure. It was unheard-of, they said, but it was right, particularly in a super-charged economy.</p>
        <p>''In the last five years or so, Vermont has become like the coast of Maine was -- the superrich are starting to discover it, and we are seeing that happen here,'' said Thomas K. Standish, chairman of the three-member Board of Listers. ''We're the first to confront the fact that very high-end properties are scarce as hen's teeth.''</p>
        <p>Despite what the Manzis say, the home's features as described by the listers sound luxurious but hardly eccentric: seven fireplaces, radiant heat in the floors, stonework in the bathrooms and old barn beams used in the construction.</p>
        <p>The dispute is now about two years old, with another hearing scheduled next week, but this much is clear: in a boom-time of got-rich-quick millionaires indulging their house fantasies, such tussles abound from the mountains of Vermont to the shores of Puget Sound.</p>
        <p>In 1997, William H. Gates briefly questioned the assessors' estimate that the 40,000-square-foot high-tech house his Microsoft billions built near Seattle was worth more than $50 million, saying no one else would pay such a price. He later withdrew the objection, and the assessment has since risen to about $110 million, putting his annual property tax at over $1 million.</p>
        <p>Also in 1997, Michael Dell, the Dell Computer mogul, challenged his county property-appraisal office in Austin, Tex., because it said his new 33,000-square-foot home was worth more than $22 million; he insisted it was worth no more than $5 million or $6 million. The two sides compromised this year on $12 million.</p>
        <p>Over all, several hundred such disputes about extra-luxurious houses may be under way around the country, said Dick Netzer, a professor of economics and public administration at New York University and an expert on property taxation. And the conflicts are not limited to houses: in a classic tax case, he noted, the owners of the New York Stock Exchange argued decades ago that it should not be assessed at what it cost to build, because it had virtually no value to anyone but the exchange.</p>
        <p>In towns like Bridgewater, with a population of about 960 people mainly of modest means, these tax conflicts can take on a tinge of David versus Goliath. Studies on other regions have found that the fanciest of houses are routinely underassessed, both because it is hard to place a value on unique properties and, some say, because towns lack the resources to fight legal challenges.</p>
        <p>When towns are challenged, ''they very frequently give way on legal battles about property taxes and zoning, in order to avoid the costs of litigation,'' Professor Netzer said. ''It happens all the time.''</p>
        <p>But not in Bridgewater. Mr. Standish and his two fellow listers, elected officials paid $9 an hour for their time, have devoted more than 1,000 hours, they estimate, to fighting the Manzis' appeal, and they show no signs of flagging.</p>
        <p>''The argument that the rich don't know what they're doing with their money, and will build toys they'll never get their money back out of is not a credible one, in our opinion,'' Mr. Standish said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manzi, through his Boston lawyer, Michael Lynch, declined comment on the dispute. Mr. Lynch provided only this written statement: ''All property taxes assessed against the Manzis' Bridgewater property have been timely paid and will continue to be paid in the future. Any further comment would be inappropriate in light of the pending litigation.''</p>
        <p>Coming up in that case, which is before a state administrative judge, is testimony from Marc Nadeau, a developer and appraiser from Guilford, Conn., who has been hired by the town to testify about the market for superfancy houses.</p>
        <p>In his recent experience, he said, top-of-the-line houses are in such demand it is hard to overspend on them. A house may be idiosyncratic, but that hurts ''only if there's something terribly unusual or dysfunctional about it.''</p>
        <p>''If you had, hypothetically, 10 or 15 people who could buy a house like the Manzis' 10 or 15 years ago,'' he said, ''now there are hundreds of them, and Vermont is a prime getaway market.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Standish said that the Manzis' side has argued that houses generally do not sell for astronomical sums in Vermont. They originally argued the valuation of the house should be $1.5 million, he said, and have since come up to $2.8 million.</p>
        <p>That, the listers say, they still cannot accept. For one thing, 75 percent of the town's property taxes go to education, where they are sorely needed. But for another, they say, if they accept too low a valuation, and then the property is sold for much more, the state could deem the whole town underassessed, and everybody's taxes could go up.</p>
        <p>Already, said Nelson Lee, the chairman of the town Board of Selectmen, Vermont's recent property tax reform is hurting Bridgewater, and cases like the Manzi house further fuel the anger among old-style Vermonters that is visible these days in the thousands of ''Take Back Vermont'' signs along the state's roads.</p>
        <p>''People born in Vermont are having to give up their properties because of the tax rate being rammed down their throat by people who are like the Manzis,'' Mr. Lee said. ''It's happening in Colorado, it's happening in Maine'' he added. ''You should see what's going on there. The gentrification and the tastelessness -- and the disregard of the local guy.''</p>
