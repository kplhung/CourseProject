        <p>WorldCom in Talks to Buy Communications Concern  WorldCom is in advanced talks to acquire Intermedia Communications, a telecommunications operator in Tampa, Fla., for almost $3 billion in cash and stock, executives close to the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>Intermedia has been an attractive takeover target because it has a 54 percent stake in Digex, which provides Web-hosting services for corporate sites. WorldCom entered negotiations with Intermedia after talks between Intermedia and Global Crossing broke down. A third suitor, Exodus Communications, offered to acquire Digex directly but was rebuffed by Intermedia. [Page C2.]</p>

        <p>Trademarks Winning Domain Fights  In the continuing battles between the owners of trademarks and individuals with Internet domain addresses identical to them or nearly so, the trademark owners appear to be way ahead. Of 1,000 cases that have gone before four approved arbitration boards, three quarters have been won by the trademark owners. New Economy. [C3.]</p>
        <p>A Tiny Nation Profits From the Web  As the wholesaler to the registrars of .com, .net and .org, Network Solutions made millions registering Internet addresses, largely because of the popular .com domain. Now a company called dotTV believes it can have the same kind of success with its domain, .tv, which it says are the most recognizable two letters on the planet. But to get the name it had to pay $50 million to the nation that owned it: Tuvalu, a string of islands halfway between Hawaii and Australia. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Sports Sites Revamp Sales Strategy  Sports Web sites cheer the coming of autumn as fans increasingly flock to their computers to trade gossip, scores and injury reports on football, basketball and hockey. A year ago, many of those sites also promoted new online stores. Twelve months later, these ''sports content'' sites are putting as much distance as they can between themselves and their e-commerce experiments. They are not eschewing e-commerce altogether. Rather, many of them are taking a new approach to selling goods online, placing the site's store in the hands of an outside company. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C5.]</p>
        <p>MP3.com Disputes Copyrights  In the copyright-violation case involving Universal Music Group and MP3.com, which created a database of compact discs to allow users to listen to music from their collections on the Internet, a federal judge is set to rule this week on whether MP3.com willfully broke the law or started the service in good faith. That ruling will help determine damages. But MP3.com's lawyers now dispute the validity of Universal's copyrights because the company designated them ''works for hire,'' a concept that they argue has no legal basis. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Builder Seeks Debt Relief in Japan  A large Japanese construction company, Kumagai Gumi, is expected to ask its creditors to forgive $4.25 billion in debt. The company joins a number of debt-burdened businesses, many of them construction companies, that have asked for relief from their creditors. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Station Goes From On-Air to Online  Last Monday, a radio station in California became the first United States broadcaster to depart the FM dial and continue on the Internet without an interruption in programming. The new Web-only entity is an experiment by its parent company, Clear Channel Communications, which sold the station's two frequencies, along with 83 others, to allay Justice Department concerns about its recently completed $23.8 billion purchase of AMFM.

        <p>Chicago Markets Call Off Talks  A proposed merger of two financial powerhouses fell through late last week as the Chicago Board Options Exchange called off talks with the Chicago Board of Trade. The combination had been proposed as a way for the two exchanges, which have been fighting over trading rights, to retain their dominant positions in the face of increasing electronic competition.

        <p>U.S. Markets Closed Today  United States financial markets and banks are closed today in observance of Labor Day. Most financial markets in other countries are open.</p>
