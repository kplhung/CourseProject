        <p>Editorial says there is little justification for New York State to require electronic fingerprinting of welfare recipients and even for it to extend this antifraud weapon to 440,000 adults who qualify for Medicaid; says Medicaid fraud is largely committed by doctors and other health care providers, a problem that fingerprinting does nothing to address (M)</p>

        <p>New York was among the first states to require electronic fingerprinting of welfare recipients as a way to prevent fraud. But as Nina Bernstein of The Times reported last week, there is little solid evidence that finger imaging actually deters welfare fraud, particularly when stringent work rules, shortened eligibility times and other antifraud measures are already pushing people off public assistance rolls at a brisk pace.</p>
        <p>In fact, a study conducted for the state three years ago found that finger imaging made no difference in the approval or dropout rates of welfare recipients. Yet despite that finding, state officials are still pushing this strategy, and they are seeking approval for $9.9 million to extend a contract with a finger imaging company an additional year, to 2002.</p>

        <p>In fact, a study conducted for the state three years ago found that finger imaging made no difference in the approval or dropout rates of welfare recipients. Yet despite that finding, state officials are still pushing this strategy, and they are seeking approval for $9.9 million to extend a contract with a finger imaging company an additional year, to 2002.</p>
        <p>The state now wants to expand electronic fingerprinting to 440,000 adults who qualify for Medicaid, a proposition that makes even less sense than fingerprinting welfare recipients. Few patients are likely to seek extra medical treatment by posing as two people. In fact, Medicaid fraud is largely committed by doctors and other health care providers, a problem this measure does nothing to address.</p>
        <p>Finger imaging will merely intimidate some Medicaid applicants or cause them to stay away because of privacy concerns. The process for getting Medicaid is already complicated and difficult. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and other officials are putting together campaigns to encourage eligible uninsured individuals to enroll in Medicaid. This is no time to erect a useless, expensive hurdle that may dissuade low-income people from getting the care they need.</p>
