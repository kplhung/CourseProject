        <p>In the early 80's the outlaw country singer David Allan Coe released very small quantities of two underground albums of songs that are among the most racist, misogynist, homophobic and obscene songs recorded by a popular songwriter.</p>
        <p>Bootlegged by fans and college fraternity members for years, those songs have recently been stirring up new trouble on the Internet: they are being passed around as e-mail files accompanied by sexually explicit and racist animation and they are being posted as computer files on Web sites like www.whitesonly.net.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coe, who has long distanced himself from the music and toned down his act for his last record deal with Sony/Lucky Dog, has decided to start making money from the old music anyway. He is selling the songs on one CD on his own Web site for $45 plus shipping ($25 for cassette), though he refuses to put his name on the disc or packaging.</p>
        <p>All of this comes as Mr. Coe is being exposed to a new audience, thanks to the Detroit rap-metal star Kid Rock, who invited Mr. Coe to be an opening act on his current tour, which ended Friday. The pair also recently recorded several songs together in a Detroit studio. Some music fans are wondering how Kid Rock, who has collaborated with black rappers and has made a living through appropriating their music, can be touring with a songwriter responsible for blatantly antiblack material.</p>
        <p>In one song on Mr. Coe's ''X-Rated Hits'' CD, he rails against white women who sleep with black men, singing that it makes him want to throw up; in another, the chorus has it that some blacks ''never die/They just smell that way.'' The lyrics are a far cry from the songs Mr. Coe is better known for writing: Johnny Paycheck's ''Take This Job and Shove It,'' Tanya Tucker's ''Would You Lay With Me (In a Field of Stone)'' and his own hits like ''The Ride'' and ''Willie, Waylon and Me.'' In fact many of Mr. Coe's ''X-Rated Hits'' even make Eminem's heavily attacked recent album seem tenderhearted.</p>
        <p>''Everyone in my office -- black, white, male, female -- is going to Napster and downloading these Coe songs,'' said Randy Weiner, who is president of Aka.com, a network of hip-hop and rock Web sites. ''And the reaction is always the same: they laugh at the first song they hear, thinking it's a funny country parody. But by the third or fourth song about hating women and black people, they start to get uncomfortable and angry.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Coe very rarely performs his obscene and racist material in public, despite fan requests, he does sell the ''X-Rated Hits'' CD at his own shows. It is unclear, however, whether he is also selling the music at Kid Rock concerts because of conflicting reports from fans and spokesmen for the concert acts. Despite being called several times, Mr. Coe's manager, Bill Quisenberry, would not speak on the record about his client's ''X-Rated'' recordings or sale. A spokeswoman for Kid Rock said that she was unable to reach the singer or his management for comment.</p>
        <p>Kid Rock is a strange amalgam of influences, reveling in white-trash culture while appropriating black music, imagery and terminology. Embodying the contradictions of the mainstream genre of rap-metal, Kid Rock drops black slang into his songs, like saying that he ''macks like a real G.'' At the same time he says he is ''a John Deere-driving . . . hick.'' On one hand hiring Mr. Coe to open his shows is a natural fit for the side of Kid Rock that proudly says he was brought up in a trailer (though, like Mr. Coe's unsubstantiated boast that he murdered a fellow inmate who tried to seduce him in prison, it's  a dubious assertion).</p>
        <p>Kelefa Sanneh, the deputy editor of Transition, a journal of black culture, said that the concert pairing was evidence of hip-hop's infiltration so deep into American culture that it is no longer necessary to be hip, multicultural and cosmopolitan -- or even to care about black culture -- to be part of it. ''It's no different than when Southern rock bands in the 70's were playing blues-rock and flying the Confederate flag,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coe's obscene songs were released briefly in 1980 and 1982 as two homemade albums -- ''Underground'' and ''Nothing Sacred'' -- and sold through biker magazines. ''He recorded those when he was riding with an outlaw motorcycle gang,'' said Bill Davis, a Web designer who runs a David Allan Coe fan site. ''They were biker humor records, but then they became a big hit. It seems like he gets a lot of the young college kids with the 'X-Rated' stuff, and that then turns them on to his real music.''</p>
        <p>On Mr. Coe's official Web site, it is explained that Mr. Coe decided to reissue the material on one CD as ''a collector's item'' on his own label because he was tired of seeing other people make money by selling bootleg copies. The Web site adds that ''he will not agree to using his name on the records or to promote their sale.''</p>
