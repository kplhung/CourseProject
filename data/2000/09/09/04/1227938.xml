        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The College Board agrees with Robert J. Massa when he writes that the SAT ''is but one factor'' in the college admission process (''Who Needs the SAT?'', Op-Ed, Aug. 28). Most admission officers use the SAT, along with grades, extracurricular activities, essays and recommendations to do the difficult work of fairly selecting talented, diverse students for their institutions.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The College Board agrees with Robert J. Massa when he writes that the SAT ''is but one factor'' in the college admission process (''Who Needs the SAT?'', Op-Ed, Aug. 28). Most admission officers use the SAT, along with grades, extracurricular activities, essays and recommendations to do the difficult work of fairly selecting talented, diverse students for their institutions.</p>
        <p>Eighty-three percent of four-year colleges use the SAT in admission, a percentage that has remained stable for at least 10 years. Over the last 30 years, only 10 colleges have made the SAT optional.</p>
        <p>Eliminating the SAT would result in increasing reliance on more subjective measures of college readiness. That would hardly qualify as a ''pioneering step.'' The SAT is the single common yardstick available to benefit both students and colleges.</p>
