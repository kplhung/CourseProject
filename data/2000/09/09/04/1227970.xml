        <p>Here are three reasons why the college football season matters as soon as the ball is teed up on the first full weekend of games:</p>
        <p>*The first national title casualty was recorded as underappreciated U.C.L.A. beat overrated Alabama, 35-24.</p>
        <p>*Unheralded Toledo of the Mid-American Conference prompted soul searching in no less a gridiron icon than Joe Paterno by whipping the Nittany Lions, 24-6, on Penn State's home field.</p>
        <p>*Florida fans booed the sloppy performance of their own team and Coach Steve Spurrier punted on third-and-26 rather than watch his inept offense stumble through another play. The Gators were beating Ball State, 33-19, at the time. Name another sport where opening day matters as much it does in college football, where standards vary from program to program and so often are interconnected.</p>
        <p>Here on Saturday afternoon, Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie bounced off the field, hugged his athletic director, Kevin White (who may or may not fire him), and raised his hands asking a sold-out crowd for more noise. The Irish had outlasted Texas A&amp;M, which was ranked No. 25, by 24-10 for their first victory since midseason last year.</p>
        <p>Later in the day in Columbia, S.C., Davie's predecessor, Lou Holtz, had to chase goal-post seeking fans off the field so South Carolina could officially finish a 31-0 shutout of New Mexico State. It was the Gamecocks' first victory in 21 games -- 11 of those losses were under Holtz.</p>
        <p>Who would have thought that an Alabama team ranked No. 3 in the nation would go to the Rose Bowl to begin a national title drive against a U.C.L.A. team that had the 107th-ranked defense in the nation last year, only to leave there upset and preoccupied with different numbers? Mainly, the number of losses by other teams.</p>
        <p>''We still have an opportunity to achieve all our goals,'' Alabama guard Griff Redmill said. ''They say if you're going to lose, lose early. You can't lose any earlier than we lost today.''</p>
        <p>It is possible for the Crimson Tide to climb back to the Bowl Championship Series title game. In 1993, Florida State lost to Notre Dame during the season and earned the title. In 1996, Florida lost to Florida State but was declared national champion after winning a rematch against the Seminoles in the Sugar Bowl.</p>
        <p>But it's unlikely. Alabama must win its next 10 games, as well as the Southeastern Conference championship game, and hope that only one other team goes undefeated. Then they must hope that the computers and the polls rank them as the toughest of the one-loss teams. Either way it makes for a tense season.</p>
        <p>And who would have thought that Paterno might have to wait until next year to notch the seven victories needed to pass Bear Bryant as the coach with the most Division I-A victories? Seven victories come as sure as the cold to Happy Valley in autumn.</p>
        <p>Yes, the Nittany Lions lost the defensive stars LaVar Arrington and Courtney Brown to the National Football League and their opener to Southern California. Yes, quarterback Rashard Casey may be distracted after being arrested in the off-season and charged in the assault of an off-duty police officer in his native New Jersey. But Toledo? In Beaver Stadium?</p>
        <p>''I think we need to take a realistic look at whether we are any good,'' Paterno said after the loss. ''We have not played a decent offensive game in two weeks.''</p>
        <p>You expect the caustic Spurrier to show his disgust when quarterback Jesse Palmer goes 21 of 46 against a team that had not won a game in 17 consecutive tries. Spurrier did -- midway through the third quarter when, facing third-and-26, he decided to punt. ''It was like third-and-50,'' he said. ''We were just hoping to not get it blocked.''</p>
        <p>But even the thickest-skinned Gators were stunned on the subsequent drive when the Florida Field crowd serenaded them with boos after Ball State blocked a punt and recovered it on Florida's 13-yard line.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I've ever been booed by my own fans,'' tailback Bo Carroll said. ''It wasn't exactly the outcome we wanted.''</p>
        <p>The Gators forced a Ball State turnover and went on to a 40-19 victory. But their coach, of course, was not surprised at how the school's fans treated his team. ''We didn't play that super,'' Spurrier said. ''We won't be too full of ourselves after this one. We've got a lot of improving to do.''</p>
        <p>They better. As Week 1 demonstrated, the college football season can be over for some teams almost as soon as it begins.</p>
