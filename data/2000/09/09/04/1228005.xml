        <p>The full-page, front-page picture and the blaring tabloid headline instantly took one reader back more than 20 years, back to a Saturday afternoon at Yankee Stadium when a George Steinbrenner minion tapped him on the shoulder in the press box and said: ''George is in his office. Why don't you go see him?''</p>
        <p>The rare invitation for an audience with the Yankees' principal owner came 21 years to the day before his oral antipersonnel bomb landed on Jeff Nelson, Mike Stanton and Chuck Knoblauch. In the earlier instance, Ken Clay was the target of Steinbrenner's contrived wrath.</p>
        <p>As on that occasion, a Steinbrenner henchman facilitated this one by reaching out to a reporter and suggesting that he call the owner in Florida.</p>
        <p>The tap on the shoulder 21 years earlier came after Clay, a struggling young pitcher, squandered a 5-0 lead his teammates gave him in the first inning. He let Kansas City score a run in the second inning and three runs in the third. Clay did not survive the third inning of a game the Royals would win, 9-8.</p>
        <p>The reporter, uncertain what to expect, walked into Steinbrenner's office.</p>
        <p>''Ask me about Ken Clay,'' Steinbrenner said.</p>
        <p>''What about Ken Clay?'' the reporter asked against his better judgment.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner proceeded to tell the reporter what about Clay:</p>
        <p>''In horse racing we have what we call a morning glory. The horse works a great three or four furlongs in the morning workout and looks sensational. Then when the race comes, he starts sweating during the parade to the post and when he gets in the gate and the race starts he stinks the place out. He spits the bit.</p>
        <p>''Kenny Clay is a morning glory. He spits the bit. He doesn't have the courage. That may be harsh, but that's the way I feel. He goes one good outing and three putrid ones. This was putrid. He looks great in the bullpen, but he gets on the mound and chokes.</p>
        <p>''He was scared stiff out there. He's one of the biggest disappointments I've had since I've had the Yankees. He gets five runs, goes out and spits the bit, chokes. Word is around he doesn't have the guts. Give the guy the benefit of the doubt and he goes out and chokes like that.''</p>
        <p>Because Steinbrenner has adopted a low-key public profile in recent seasons, some people think he has mellowed. He would probably be insulted if someone said that to his face, but he doesn't have to worry that his tough-boss image is fading. He hasn't changed one bit. The Yankees just haven't given him many chances to pull out the old George.</p>
        <p>What can even Steinbrenner find to fault with a team that wins 114 games in a season, that loses only three postseason games in two years, that wins three World Series in four years, that wins 12 consecutive World Series games?</p>
        <p>How many fat toads come along to rouse his public ire?</p>
        <p>But this season the Yankees, for the most part, have not been their dominating selves. They have never been in danger of falling short of the postseason, but they weren't moving toward it with their late 1990's intimidation. They weren't burying Boston and Toronto in the standing. They weren't implementing the scorched-earth style Steinbrenner demands.</p>
        <p>And then their pre-Rivera relief tandem of Nelson and Stanton began giving up game-altering home runs and assorted other hits and walks. Knoblauch, already having frustrated the owner along with everyone else with a mysterious throwing problem, languished on the disabled list with a mysterious elbow ailment.</p>
        <p>Finally, the window of Steinbrenner's opportunity was open, and he leaped through it, mouth first. His timing, however, was weird.</p>
        <p>Despite suffering whatever problems the owner perceived as undermining the immediate future of the most expensive team in baseball history, the Yankees have been winning with regularity. Seventeen victories in the 25 games before yesterday represented their best 25-game stretch since the first month of the season. Their six-game lead over the Red Sox was their largest of the season.</p>
        <p>But as if to fuel Steinbrenner's worst fears, the Yankees suffered an improbable loss yesterday, 2-1, in 10 innings to the Minnesota Twins.</p>
        <p>The Yankees with their $100 million-plus payroll and Roger Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award winner, against the team with the major leagues' lowest payroll ($14,887,500) and a rookie pitcher making his third major league start. Ten players in the Twins' starting lineup earning a collective $5,252,500 against 10 players in the Yankees' lineup with salaries totaling $58,507,143, with half the Yankees' starters each earning more than the entire Twins' lineup.</p>
        <p>''Biggest number in Vegas,'' Tom Kelly, the Minnesota manager, said of the betting odds on the game. ''You look at that number and you go, 'Oh my.' ''</p>
        <p>But Matt Kinney, the 23-year-old rookie, stifled the Yankees on one run and two hits in six innings. Three relievers kept the Yankees stifled the rest of the way. A couple more games like this one, and the owner will be storming through the press box, telling reporters to ask him about Bernie Williams and David Justice and Glenallen Hill.</p>
