        <p>Quarterback Vinny Testaverde felt the rush of emotion as he left Lambeau Field and then he sat in his locker crying yesterday, the relief of his comeback checkered by memories of his father Al, who died in February 1999 and to whom he has dedicated the season. With his 44 attempts, Testaverde passed Phil Simms to take over 15th place on the National Football League's all-time pass attempts list.</p>
        <p>Testaverde's 23 completions also sent him past Simms into 18th place and leave him just three short of passing Jim Hart for 14th place on the all-time completions list. Testaverde received a game ball.</p>

        <p>Quarterback Vinny Testaverde felt the rush of emotion as he left Lambeau Field and then he sat in his locker crying yesterday, the relief of his comeback checkered by memories of his father Al, who died in February 1999 and to whom he has dedicated the season. With his 44 attempts, Testaverde passed Phil Simms to take over 15th place on the National Football League's all-time pass attempts list.</p>
        <p>Testaverde's 23 completions also sent him past Simms into 18th place and leave him just three short of passing Jim Hart for 14th place on the all-time completions list. Testaverde received a game ball.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't any one point I thought I made it to this point,'' Testaverde said. ''This was probably one of my most enjoyable victories.''</p>
        <p>Penalty Woes</p>
        <p>If there was a downside to the Jets' performance, it was the play of left tackle Jason Fabini. He was called for four of the Jets' 10 penalties and accounted for 35 yards of penalties by himself. It was an unusually error-prone effort by Fabini, who took over the left tackle spot when Jumbo Elliott -- who has since come out of retirement -- left after last season.</p>
        <p>One of Fabini's penalties nullified a play in which Wayne Chrebet caught a touchdown pass. Fabini was benched after that, and Kerry Jenkins, who started the game at left guard, played left tackle while the backup David Loverne played left guard.</p>
        <p>Fabini left the locker room quickly after the game and Groh would not say that he would definitively start Fabini next week. Elliott, who was serving a one-game suspension this week, will be available next week. ''We'll take some more analysis,'' Groh said. ''No player is worth penalties.''</p>
        <p>Forcing the Issue</p>
        <p>The rookie Shaun Ellis, who did not start at left end after being given a prodigious opportunity to win the spot in the preseason, performed as if he was trying to force his way into the lineup. He had three tackles, and on a sack of Brett Favre, he forced a fumble that the Packers recovered. Ellis also recovered a fumble by Ahman Green that was forced by Rick Lyle.</p>
