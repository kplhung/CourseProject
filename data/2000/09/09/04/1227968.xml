        <p>Ogen Rintzler came from Israel to the blue-green waters of the Black Sea this afternoon to say farewell to his parents and to heal a wound even deeper than their loss. Chefner Tudor made the journey in memory of his best friend. Ilana Blum came to acknowledge the father whose death she had long refused to accept.</p>
        <p>They were among 70 relatives and friends from around the world who gathered for a memorial service at sea honoring 778 Romanian Jews and crew members who died in 1942 when a Russian submarine sank their disabled ship, the Struma.</p>
        <p>They all had their own memories of loss as a cantor's voice carried the song of the dead across the calm, sun-drenched water. They wept, they held each other and they seemed to find solace in finally saying goodbye.</p>
        <p>''Now we can pass this memory to the next generation so that they don't forget the Struma,'' said Mr. Rintzler, 73.</p>
        <p>The sinking of the Struma was a wartime horror that the world had largely forgotten. But some of the sensitivities surrounding the episode were resurrected by the effort led by a grandson of two of the victims to locate the wreckage and hold the memorial service. Turkey refused at first to grant permission for dives to try to find the wreckage.</p>
        <p>When the divers went down anyway, their vessel was boarded by the Turkish Coast Guard and the crew was held for several hours. Their release came only through the intervention of one of the country's wealthiest families.</p>
        <p>Approval for the dives finally came after Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel raised the issue with his Turkish counterpart, Bulent Ecevit, during a state visit late last month. By then, time was too short to find the wreck. But the search leader said he was confident it was in 250 feet of water, about five miles offshore near where the Bosporus joins the Black Sea north of Istanbul. The graves of seven victims were discovered in the cemetery of a coastal village.</p>
        <p>Just as the modern search for the Struma was enmeshed in politics, so was its sinking at the height of World War II.</p>
        <p>The Struma left the Romanian port of Constanta on Dec. 11, 1941, carrying Romanian Jews fleeing persecution and heading for Palestine. Its engine failed on the Black Sea and it was towed into Istanbul.</p>
        <p>Turkey, trying to remain neutral, refused to allow anyone off the ship. The British, who controlled Palestine, were refusing entry to large numbers of Jews because they did not want to antagonize the Arabs.</p>
        <p>''We had a very clear policy of restricting immigration to Palestine,'' said David Logan, the British ambassador to Turkey, who attended today's service with his wife, Judy. ''In retrospect, we could obviously have adopted a more humane attitude.''</p>
        <p>The Struma sat in Istanbul for 70 days, growing more squalid by the day. The ship was a converted steamer with a single outlet for fresh water. The only food came from the city's Jews. Efforts to repair the engine failed.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 23, 1942, the police towed the Struma up the Bosporus as passengers hung signs from its sides pleading ''Help us.'' The ship was set adrift in the Black Sea and at dawn the next day it was sunk by a Russian submarine for unknown reasons. Only one person survived.</p>
        <p>Though it was the biggest loss of life in the exodus to Palestine, the episode might have remained relegated to academic studies if not for Greg Buxton, a computer programmer from Birmingham, England, whose paternal grandparents perished on the ship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buxton spent two years and all of his money organizing the search. He said today he expected that future efforts by the governments of Israel and Turkey would find the ship. But from the outset, he said the more important goal was remembering those who died with the memorial service.</p>
        <p>Ogen Rintzler was 14 in early 1941 when his father and mother, Ahron and Fanni Rintzler, sent him, their only child, to Palestine. His parents had visited the country in the 1930's and his father fell in love with the dream of a Jewish homeland. His parents booked passage on the Struma to join him.</p>
        <p>''The entire family was against my parents getting on the Struma,'' Mr. Rintzler said. ''They sent a rabbi to convince my father not to take the ship.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rintzler has remained in Israel, marrying, building a business career, raising his own children. He learned to live with the deaths of his parents, but several years ago he discovered something that renewed and increased his sorrow. An uncle told him that his mother was pregnant when she boarded the ship.</p>
        <p>''This was the heaviest blow,'' Mr. Rintzler said mournfully, looking at a photograph of himself as a boy with his parents in Bucharest. ''Knowing what they suffered, what my mother suffered while she was pregnant, it was worse than the deaths.''</p>
        <p>Chefner Tudor, 80, came to Istanbul from Haifa, Israel, to honor his best boyhood friend, Norbert Storfer. Were it not for an accident of history, someone might have been there today remembering Mr. Tudor.</p>
        <p>''I was registered on the Struma, but there were delays and another ship became available,'' Mr. Tudor said. ''I told Norbert he should come with me, but he said he was enrolled on the Struma and he would wait.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tudor sailed on the Dorian II, arriving in Istanbul with about 600 Jews from Romania and Bulgaria. The people from that earlier ship were allowed to disembark and proceed to Palestine by train and bus, and Mr. Tudor has  lived there ever since.</p>
        <p>Horia Lobel was the Struma's doctor. His pregnant wife stayed behind and planned to join him with the baby in Palestine later.</p>
        <p>''My mother was always waiting for him to send for us,'' said Ilana Blum, the daughter Dr. Lobel never knew. ''There were rumors of survivors.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Blum, a professor at a Tel Aviv medical school, and her mother were given shelter by a Christian family in the Romanian mountains during the war. She was 14 before she knew she was Jewish. She was 58 before she accepted her father's death.</p>
        <p>''Until now, I always thought that maybe he somehow survived,'' she said sadly as flowers tossed onto the sea by mourners floated past the ship. ''Now I have closed the circle.''</p>
