        <p>With President Clinton preparing to visit New York this week for a meeting of world leaders at the United Nations, the American ambassador, Richard C. Holbrooke, said on Saturday that the United States must focus more on its ties with the organization, which he called ''indispensable'' to American foreign policy.</p>
        <p>''American dollars spent on the United Nations are worthwhile,'' Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview. ''We need to fix it and save it, rather than walk away from it or weaken it.''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Clinton will open a three-day series of speeches and round-table discussions by more than 150 heads of government, many of whom will also be talking privately in dozens of specially constructed conference nooks or in diplomatic missions around New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke, who is completing a year as ambassador to the United Nations, has found much of his time consumed in lobbying his administration colleagues on international issues and in carrying out demands made on the United Nations by Congress. A group of congressmen who have often been hostile to the United Nations have established multiple hurdles to full American participation, blocking payment of past dues and some new assessments.</p>
        <p>''The U.S. will have to have a more profound discussion on how the U.N. fits into its security objectives,'' Mr. Holbrooke said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke's potential foreign policy role in a new Democratic administration -- if Vice President Al Gore wins the presidency in November -- is the focus of unending speculation among other diplomats. But he said he intended to ''work straight through until Jan. 20'' no matter what the outcome of the election. His arrival here was delayed a year by Congressional blocks and federal ethics investigations, largely into his contacts with American embassies after he left a federal post.</p>
        <p>He said that he did not disagree that reform was still needed in the United Nations and that, in his dealings with the organization's international civil servants, he had been ''dismayed at the bureaucratic behavior and obstructionism.''</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Holbrooke has been vocal in criticizing United Nations shortcomings, especially when members of Congress are visiting, there is no doubt that his job has been made more difficult by Congressional restrictions imposed in the name of reform, other diplomats say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke and another ambassador, Donald Hays, a budget and management expert assigned full time to the American mission to the United Nations, have spent many hours fighting to get United States  dues to the organization reduced -- to 22 percent of the regular budget, from 25 percent, and to 25 percent of peacekeeping costs, from just over 30 percent. Congress has demanded the reduction, but other member nations regard any reduction as a violation of treaty obligations.</p>
        <p>It is far from certain they will succeed, most other diplomats say, since 188 nations will have to agree to let the richest country in the world cut back on payments geared to the American portion of the international economy, which is higher than the Congressional targets.</p>
        <p>The American delegation has also had to expend much diplomatic capital this year to get the United States back on an important budget committee, where it had lost a seat because of other nations' anger at its  failure to pay its dues.</p>
        <p>When any peacekeeping operation is planned, Mr. Holbrooke must hold up a final decision by the Security Council for 15 days in order to notify Congress and give members the right to object. At the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a spokesman said that this was a pledge made voluntarily by the Clinton administration, not a Congressional rule, and that it reflected the administration's unwillingness to fight on Capitol Hill over United Nations issues.</p>
