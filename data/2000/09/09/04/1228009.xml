        <p>Given the customary symbolism affixed to season-opening games, the Giants' debut performance of the 2000 season was not particularly nouveau in style or stylishly notable. In the Arizona Cardinals, the favored Giants recognized a team in disarray and quickly stomped to a large early lead they gingerly protected in a 21-16 victory.</p>
        <p>But for the Giants, a team with few achievements in recent seasons, there was an execution of purpose -- and an unexpected flash -- within today's solid, clean victory at Giants Stadium. The Giants may have defeated a team that could be the least proficient of any Giants opponent this season, but there is always some credit to following a plan as designed.</p>
        <p>The Giants had set out to run the ball and gained 223 rushing yards, the most in three years. They had set out to win the turnover battle, and they created four while committing only two turnovers of their own.</p>
        <p>The offensive line, a fidgety, unsure lot that disrupted the offense's rhythm with its penalties and breakdowns last season, did not have a penalty and did not yield a sack. The defense sagged late but stuffed the Cardinals early, holding them to 3 points in the first three quarters.</p>
        <p>Then there was the thunder and lightning.</p>
        <p>Above the stadium, with a crash and a bolt, it appeared to the west, bringing about a 23-minute delay of the game early in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>On the new grass field of the stadium, the self-labeled Thunder and Lightning combination of Giants running backs Ron Dayne and Tiki Barber scored three touchdowns. Barber had the Giants' first two scores, one on a crazy-legged touchdown dash from sideline to sideline and another on a 78-yard burst up the middle.</p>
        <p>''You play to win the game, and that's what we did,'' said Giants Coach Jim Fassel, who is now undefeated in four season openers. ''I know there were things that didn't go exactly right at the end. We'll work on that. But let's not forget all the good parts of the game, too.''</p>
        <p>And for the Giants, the best part was that they did not flop in a game they probably could not afford to lose. Not with the Philadelphia Eagles, who overpowered the Cowboys in Dallas today, playing host to the Giants next weekend.</p>
        <p>''What's important is that we beat a team we were supposed to beat,'' said Lomas Brown, the Giants' new, but 15-year veteran at left tackle. ''Yeah, we've got to play better. But this is a big first step.''</p>
        <p>The Giants played with poise and confidence from the beginning today -- at least until the fourth quarter -- and showed cohesion that belied all the turnover on the roster.</p>
        <p>Compared with their starting lineup in last year's opening game, there were nine new starters. But the Giants looked unified, sending an early message when they sent the Cardinals off the field after only three plays at the start of the game.</p>
        <p>Offensively, the Giants moved the ball early, and though they played conservatively and rarely threw the football downfield against an Arizona secondary that kept its safeties deep, they took a lead on their second possession that they never relinquished.</p>
        <p>On that 66-yard, 10-play drive, Kerry Collins, who completed 17 of 25 passes for 172 yards, converted on consecutive third-down plays with a 24-yard pass to Ike Hilliard and a 13-yard screen pass to fullback Greg Comella.</p>
        <p>Barber, who had 144 yards on 13 carries, and Dayne, 78 yards on 23 carries, took the Giants to the Cardinals' 10-yard line.</p>
        <p>Barber then took a toss to the right but found the Cardinals waiting for him. Barber said he followed his instincts, which meant reversing his field to the left. ''It's a risk and reward type of thing when you do that,'' Barber said.</p>
        <p>Barber's speed, brought on in part by added strength and a few less pounds, reduced the risk. He outraced two Arizona defenders to the end zone.</p>
        <p>Early in the second quarter, after an 11-yard pass from Collins to wide receiver Amani Toomer eased the Cardinals' safeties off the line of scrimmage slightly, the Giants gave the ball to Barber again, this time on a quick slant to the right side.</p>
        <p>The Giants' remade offensive line, which steadily protected Collins and opened a variety of holes, provided Barber an impressive gap to run through. Barber dashed between center Dusty Zeigler and right guard Ron Stone -- with right tackle Luke Petitgout sealing the outside. Barber outran cornerbacks Aeneas Williams and Tom Knight to the end zone, the 78-yard scoring play the fourth-longest running play in team history.</p>
        <p>''I guess I'm getting a little faster in my old age,'' said Barber, who added that he expected to have a big day. ''I hope to have 15 more big days.''</p>
        <p>It is part of the Giants' strategy for Barber to help the team take a lead and Dayne to help protect it. To that end, Dayne saved his best running between the tackles for the fourth quarter. And on the final play of a 15-play drive, Dayne powered in over right guard for a 7-yard touchdown that gave the Giants a 21-3 lead.</p>
        <p>''I think we saw a little of what Ron can do for us,'' Fassel said of Dayne, who had 36 yards on 6 attempts on the Giants' last touchdown drive. ''And he'll get better.''</p>
        <p>After the Giants took their 18-point lead, the Cardinals began to take more chances -- and the Giants played more prevent defense.</p>
        <p>That combination led to two touchdown passes from Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer to wide receiver David Boston, the second coming with only 39 seconds left in the game.</p>
        <p>Plummer's two touchdown passes did not negate his three interceptions, and though he threw for 318 yards while completing 28 of 49 passes, it did not make up for an otherwise sloppy game.</p>
        <p>''I think it was a game that we controlled,'' Giants linebacker Jessie Armstead said. ''We needed that. Opening day is about getting off on the right foot and feeling good about yourself. We got both those things done.''</p>
