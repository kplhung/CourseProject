        <p>As smoke pots simulating fires spewed yellow fumes from the buildings, military trucks rumbled today into Shirahige Nishi, a dilapidated quarter of Tokyo, rushing in olive-uniformed reinforcements for civilian rescue squads overwhelmed by the wounded.</p>
        <p>Just when the action seemed to reach its peak, as clattering helicopters danced green against the blue skies above, this show's director swooped in. Following an elaborate schedule with clockwork precision, he visited neighborhood after neighborhood to view staged earthquake devastation.</p>
        <p>The choreographer of all of this action was Shintaro Ishihara, the very pleased-looking governor of Tokyo prefecture who has long been known as a populist conservative showman. It was clearly a moment of glory for this politician, who had turned a boring annual earthquake-readiness drill, traditionally held in early September in recognition of the great Tokyo earthquake on Sept. 1, 1923, into one of the largest military exercises most Japanese have seen since the end of World War II.</p>
        <p>The prime minister had to content himself with a low-profile visit to a basement command room of Japan's armed forces to monitor the  progress of the drill before rushing off to greet the visiting Russian president.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ishihara, who flitted from one neighborhood to another all day aboard a red rescue helicopter, was fulfilling a nationalist's dream: returning the military to the national stage, and getting hugged by female admirers at every step.</p>
        <p>Beyond the rope lines of eager supporters who waved to the governor all along his passage today, the appearance of more than 7,000 uniformed soldiers in the streets of central Tokyo has also revived discussions of a militarist past that is fast fading from living memory.</p>
        <p>Political activism may be feeble in Japan, but pacifism here still runs deep. Many Japanese who questioned the need for a military drill on this scale said that they saw the exercise, Tokyo Big Rescue, as being as much a public relations operation for the military as a disaster-preparedness drill.</p>
        <p>Japanese politics have been inching rightward in recent years, these critics say, and one of the cherished goals of many in the governing Liberal Democratic Party is a revision of the Constitution to allow Japan to field a full-fledged army for the first time since its defeat in 1945.</p>
        <p>''There are two purposes behind this exercise,'' said Atsuo Nakamura, an opposition member of Parliament. ''Ishihara wants to change the Constitution, and turn Japan into a big military country again. The other purpose is that Japan is in very bad economic condition, and politicians like this are trying to blame people of other nationalities for our troubles.</p>
        <p>''That is a very classic way of dealing with problems, just like Hitler did. The Japanese people are very nationalistic, and he wants to awaken this feeling to become more popular.''</p>
        <p>The earthquake drill's link to questions of constitutional reform, nationalism and xenophobia is the doing of Mr. Ishihara, who has made a career of right-wing causes, from planting Japanese flags on tiny islands disputed between Japan and China to worshiping at shrines associated with war criminals.</p>
        <p>In April, Mr. Ishihara set a divisive tone for the exercise while addressing members of the army. ''Third-country nationals and foreigners who have entered Japan illegally have perpetrated heinous crimes,'' he said. ''In the event of a major earthquake, riots could break out, and there is a limit to the police's ability to cope with such a situation alone. I want you to carry out your mission, not only to deal with natural disasters, but also to maintain law and order.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ishihara has since apologized to Tokyo's foreign residents for his remarks, after having been reminded that as many as 7,000 Koreans were killed by mobs of Japanese troops and civilians during the turmoil of the 1923 earthquake after rumors spread that they were committing sabotage or had even caused the natural disaster. His aides have since tried to focus the debate on the need to use the rarely activated army to assist in disaster relief.</p>
        <p>But his office continues to make xenophobic statements. ''Generally speaking the Koreans have made a good adjustment to this country, but we still have many illegal Chinese who are penetrating this country illegally and are carrying out terrible crimes,'' Atsuyuki Sassa, a security adviser to Mr. Ishihara, said yesterday. ''There are Iranians, and others. We have many new problems as a result of this. And what Mr. Ishihara was saying is that we must maintain peace and order in the case of a disaster.''</p>
        <p>And yesterday, Mr. Ishihara himself dismissed critics of the drill as ''left-wing idiots.''</p>
        <p>Several associations of foreign residents in Japan have responded warily to the drill, seeing it as the latest sign of mounting hostility toward other Asians in Japan.</p>
        <p>''The right wing in Japan has always been very hostile to Koreans and Chinese,'' said So Chungo On, director of Chosensoren, an association of residents of Korean descent. ''These kinds of people feel that the past history of the military in Japan is glorious. All we can do is hope that this drill is not aimed at us. More than 55 years has passed since the war ended, and the old ways of thinking should have changed by now as we enter the century of internationalization. The governor himself should be a leader.''</p>
        <p>In Shirahige Nishi, an area of grassy plots and collapsing hovels chosen for the drills, Kudo Chisato, a lifelong resident, peered out from her shingled home, one of the few sturdy buildings remaining in the area. She declared the drills great entertainment as the first helicopters began appearing and firemen began extinguishing imaginary blazes with their hoses.</p>
        <p>But asked if such a show of force was needed to rein in lawless foreigners, she scoffed. ''I'm not worried at all,'' she said, before referring to the 1923 quake, with its mob killings. ''What happened before was 80 years ago. The Japanese are gentle now, and it is unlikely that foreigners would pose a threat either.''</p>
