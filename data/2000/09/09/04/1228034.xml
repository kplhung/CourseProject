        <p>An earthquake with a magnitude of 5.2  rattled Northern California's wine country before dawn today, taking place along a previously undiscovered fault line and surprising seismologists.</p>
        <p>The epicenter of the earthquake was three miles southwest of Yountville, Calif., under Mount Veeders, the most prominent peak in the area.</p>
        <p>''This does not put it on any known fault, making it a totally new event,'' said Pat Jorgenson, a spokeswoman for the United States Geological Survey in Menlo Park, Calif.</p>
        <p>''It's unusual because with all today's technology we really feel we have most of the faults located,'' Ms. Jorgenson said. ''But then something like this happens and we go, 'Oops, I'll be darned.' ''</p>
        <p>The agency will analyze the fault line, add it to maps and eventually name it, she said.</p>
        <p>The earthquake occurred at 1:36 a.m. and lasted 18 seconds. Two aftershocks, of magnitude 1.5 and 1.8,  were reported. People near the epicenter of an earthquake in the range of 5.2 experience ''heavy shaking and things being knocked off shelves,'' Ms. Jorgenson said. In contrast, a 6.5-magnitude earthquake would cause serious structural damage to buildings and bridges.</p>
        <p>Several dozen minor injuries were attributed to the earthquake, and at least three people suffered more serious injuries when they fell or were hit by falling objects.</p>
        <p>About 10,000 residents lost power and 500 lost gas service, said Pacific Gas and Electric, which expected all service to be restored by Monday.</p>
        <p>While most restaurants and wineries seem to have been spared major damage, Bistro Don Giovanni in Napa, about six miles from Yountville, lost about 60 percent of its wine.</p>
        <p>''Everything in our bar came down, everything in our wine room came down, everything in our kitchen all came crashing down,'' said Bettina Rouas, the general manager. ''The walls in the office are all cracked.''</p>
        <p>Many residents who had experienced previous earthquakes described this episode as a sudden, violent shock, compared with the fluid rolling action of other quakes.</p>
        <p>''For me it was a big one,'' said Mimi Ramirez, 27, a cashier at a 7-Eleven, who was sleeping when the earthquake hit.</p>
        <p>''When I opened my eyes, it was like a shock, like thunder storming, you know. And I felt like the ground was opening,'' Ms. Ramirez said.</p>
        <p>Although the shaking was most severe near Napa, tremors were felt from San Francisco to Sacramento.</p>
        <p>''My husband and I heard it and thought someone was trying to open our garage,'' said Arnita Leneir, 34, of Sacramento. ''Then after a while we both just kind of sat up in bed and said, 'Oh my God, that was an earthquake.' ''</p>
        <p>Earthquake or no earthquake, the crowds flocking to wine country this holiday weekend for its culinary and scenic diversions were not changing their plans much.</p>
        <p>Crowded as ever, the Napa Valley wine train chugged out for its three-hour run around the region on schedule. And hot air balloons floating over the vineyards touched down right on time for the accustomed champagne brunch.</p>
        <p>''There has been absolutely no disruption for our tourists,'' said Dave Means, a volunteer at the Napa Valley Conference and Visitors Center.</p>
