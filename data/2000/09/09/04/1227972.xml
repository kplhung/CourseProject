        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I was recently seated in the second row at a preview performance of ''Imperfect Chemistry,'' a new musical at the Minetta Lane Theater. As the couple seated beside me were settling in, the woman apologized to those within earshot for any potential inconvenience.</p>
        <p>She explained that she had rescued an injured pigeon from the street, got a paper bag from a nearby store and brought the poor creature to the theater so she could take it to the veterinarian afterward.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I was recently seated in the second row at a preview performance of ''Imperfect Chemistry,'' a new musical at the Minetta Lane Theater. As the couple seated beside me were settling in, the woman apologized to those within earshot for any potential inconvenience.</p>
        <p>She explained that she had rescued an injured pigeon from the street, got a paper bag from a nearby store and brought the poor creature to the theater so she could take it to the veterinarian afterward.</p>
        <p>There was some crinkling and crackling of the bag at first as the bird rattled around, but as the first musical number began, it settled down and was quiet for the rest of the show. One can only suppose it approved of the music.</p>
        <p>JARRETT KROLL</p>
        <p>It was a perfect August night, and Cindy Wallis was at Lincoln Center at an outdoor jazz concert featuring the saxophonist Sonny Rollins. Suddenly her attention was riveted by the man in front of her. She couldn't believe her eyes. He had picked the pocket of the person in front of him, lifted the cell phone and calmly proceeded to make a call. When the conversation ended, she watched mesmerized as the ''thief'' gently returned the phone to the pocket.</p>
        <p>SEPTEMBER</p>
        <p>Today's warm breeze</p>
        <p>Still filled with flowers</p>
        <p>Has a shiver in its touch.</p>
        <p>CONSTANCE BROCK</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Maria's Hot Dogs, a stand in Rockland County, is run by a young woman who has frequently been asked the same questions and obviously reached the end of her patience. She posted a notice that is excerpted here:</p>
        <p>1. Are you married? No</p>
        <p>2. Can we go out as friends? No</p>
        <p>3. Am I a real blonde? No</p>
        <p>4. Do you work out? No</p>
        <p>5. Do I want to have your baby? No</p>
        <p>6. Did you pose for Playboy? No</p>
        <p>7. Am I lying? No.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I was walking along 63rd Street near Broadway waiting for a green light so I could cross over to Lincoln Center. A large tour bus full of passengers pulled over near the curb. The bus driver honked his horn and opened the door. He called my name and turned to his passengers and said, ''Everybody, I would like you to meet Mrs. Dawson, my kindergarten teacher.''</p>
        <p>All the people waved at me, shouted ''hello,'' and stared. The driver, Tex Williams, was in my kindergarten class at Public School 191 behind Lincoln Center about 40 years ago.</p>
        <p>It made me feel so special and remembered. I know now what it feels like to be a celebrity in New York City, to be recognized and acclaimed by a doting public.</p>
        <p>RITA V. DAWSON</p>
        <p>Susan Winkler's octogenarian aunt, Shirley Fisher, was at 14th Street and First Avenue, trying unsuccessfully to find a taxi to take her to a doctor's appointment uptown. After 10 minutes, a man about 40 appeared at her side, also trying to hail a taxi. ''Just remember, I was here first,'' she said. Another 10 minutes went by, and as she paused in her taxi efforts, she noticed that the man had disappeared. Soon after, an occupied cab slowed down, the back window rolled down and a voice said, ''Hop in.'' She did, and made her appointment on time. The man had walked over to Second Avenue where there was less traffic and succeeded in getting a taxi.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>A friend recently took me to lunch at a Midtown steakhouse. Shortly after we were seated, we noticed a solitary man across the aisle being served a beautiful and expensive porterhouse steak. He asked for some ketchup, and when it arrived poured most of the contents of the bottle over the steak.</p>
        <p>A woman at a table adjacent to his commented to her companion, ''What a terrible thing to do to a perfectly good steak.''</p>
        <p>''Madam,'' the gentleman replied calmly, ''if you are willing to pick up the check, I'll eat the steak any way you want me to.''</p>
        <p>HARVARD HOLLENBERG</p>
        <p>Clyde Lynwood Sawyer Jr. has passed on what might be called the New Yorker 10-Second Shell Theorem. It originates with his friends Ron and Di Oates, recent visitors from England. Their conclusion: ''In any given encounter (cash register, ticket desk, sidewalk collision), New Yorkers will be indifferent, brusque, uncivil and even hostile. If, however, you are willing to wait 10 seconds, until their public carapaces have melted, they will become the most gracious, accommodating people on earth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sawyer admits that they might have a point. But he says, ''I'm still waiting for some public exchange lasting more than 10 seconds to test out their postulate.''</p>
        <p>SCHOOL DAYS</p>
        <p>Old yellowed buses</p>
        <p>Filled with low octane fuel</p>
        <p>And high octane kids</p>
        <p>Accelerate across fresh paved roads</p>
        <p>As yet untouched by the skid marks</p>
        <p>Of either joy or sorrow.</p>
        <p>On these early mornings</p>
        <p>Worn-out grinding gears</p>
        <p>Downshift away from the</p>
        <p>Certainty of academic madness</p>
        <p>And steer clear of the wild</p>
        <p>Turns of first-love sadness.</p>
        <p>And as the days drive</p>
        <p>Toward an untouched future</p>
        <p>Any overworked adult who</p>
        <p>Used to be a child, recollects</p>
        <p>The sweetness of hopeful hearts and</p>
        <p>Recalls the dream of fresh starts.</p>
        <p>ROGER GRANET</p>
        <p>Scene: Outdoor cafe on Broadway.</p>
        <p>The players: Tina Kramer and Peter Seligman of Derwood, Md., and their 9-year-old daughter, Molly.</p>
        <p>Action: Molly observes the endless parade of chic New Yorkers with fascination. After some time, she turns to her mother and asks, with some concern, ''Mom, did you pack me any black clothes?''</p>
        <p>Mom hadn't, but Molly did acquire a black outfit before her return home.</p>
        <p>Marcie Livingston still remembers the young boy who lived next door when, as a newlywed, she moved into Stuyvesant Town. ''Do you live here?'' he asked as he saw her going into her apartment.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''My neighbor used to live here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I was walking near Grand Central Terminal when I noticed one of New York's finest arresting a sidewalk vendor with a blanket full of homemade CD's -- all the latest releases, shrink-wrapped. As he was being handcuffed, the vendor was protesting loudly. ''There's no difference in this and Napster! Why are you arresting me?''</p>
        <p>The officer kept fastening the cuffs behind the man's back and asked, ''What's Napster?''</p>
        <p>The vendor replied that it was on the Internet. The officer chuckled and said, ''Well, I don't patrol the Internet.''</p>
