        <p>A major Japanese construction company, Kumagai Gumi, is expected to ask its creditors to forgive 450 billion yen in debt, or $4.25 billion.</p>
        <p>The company joins a number of debt-burdened businesses, many of them construction companies, that have asked for relief from their creditors. Japan's construction industry has been among the most heavily indebted.</p>
        <p>Kumagai Gumi said in a statement on Friday only that it was in talks with its main creditor, the Sumitomo Bank.</p>
        <p>But reports here said that in return for debt relief, Kumagai Gumi had agreed to cut jobs sharply and to reduce back orders to half their current level. The company, the reports said, is also seeking a partnership with the Kajima Corporation, one of the largest Japanese general contractors, which would inject fresh capital into Kumagai Gumi.</p>
        <p>A number of big contractors including Tobishima, Aoki and Haseko have already reached accords with their lenders, seeking waivers of debt in the hundreds of billions of yen. ''All weak construction companies are close to having some form of debt relief,'' said Garry Evans, a strategist with HSBC Securities here.</p>
        <p>Other companies have not been so lucky. Sogo, a department store chain that collapsed in July, had asked banks to forgive loans totaling nearly $6 billion. The bailout plan fell through when one of the biggest creditors, Shinsei Bank -- acquired last year by foreign investors led by Ripplewood Holdings of New York -- balked. Shinsei is also a major creditor of Kumagai Gumi.</p>
        <p>But analysts say that construction companies are too politically connected to fail. ''Construction firms are basically not allowed to go bust,'' Mr. Evans said. The industry employs more than 10 percent of the Japanese labor  force, and construction workers often campaign in support of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
