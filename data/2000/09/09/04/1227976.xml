        <p>THE wispy young woman paces at the back of the crowd, nodding incessantly as Al Gore makes another arcane point about the intricacies of Medicare.

        <p>THE wispy young woman paces at the back of the crowd, nodding incessantly as Al Gore makes another arcane point about the intricacies of Medicare. She claps gently and gives her fist a half-pump,  almost as if afraid that someone will see. It is not every 27-year-old, after all, who can be driven to ecstasy by a candidate's pledge to put the Medicare surplus in a lock box.</p>
        <p>But Sarah A. Bianchi is not just any twenty-something. In the five years since she graduated from Harvard, where she shared a suite in Leverett House with Mr. Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna Gore Schiff, Ms. Bianchi has worked as an assistant to the associate director for health at the Office of Management and Budget, an assistant director for health policy at the president's domestic policy council, the senior health care adviser to the vice president and now as deputy issues director of the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gore has increasingly positioned his politics around his devotion to policy, Ms. Bianchi has become one of his most visible staff members. Last week, after pulling near all-nighters to compile briefing papers on health care, she worked the campaign's press filing centers doggedly and sat in on conference calls, answering reporters' questions about the details of Mr. Gore's proposals and taking shots at those of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, at a health care forum in Albuquerque, a woman in the audience asked Mr. Gore whether his proposal to expand the federal Children's Health Insurance Program would cover prenatal care. He had no idea.</p>
        <p>''Is Sarah out there somewhere?'' Mr. Gore pleaded, scanning the crowd. She wasn't, having stayed in a nearby filing center, where reporters and Gore aides were watching the event on closed-circuit television.</p>
        <p>Hearing her name, Ms. Bianchi scurried to the rescue. She assured the woman, and Mr. Gore, that the plan would restore prenatal care coverage that had been cut several years ago.</p>
        <p>''It's something that Gore's been fighting for for a long time,'' Ms. Bianchi told the woman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, laughing at himself, said, ''As I was saying, part of my proposal is to restore the coverage for people in that situation.''</p>
        <p>Over the course of the campaign, Mr. Gore and his aides said, Ms. Bianchi has earned a place at the table with a passionate commitment to social policy, a steel-trap mind for numbers, a quiet confidence that belies her age and a determination that policy not be compromised by politics. If some Gore aides once dismissed her because of her youth, they now know that she has his complete confidence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, in an interview, described Ms. Bianchi -- ''Sarah B.'' to the Gore family -- as ''scary smart,'' and possessing an encyclopedic expertise on health and welfare policy.</p>
        <p>Didn't it make him nervous to place someone so young in a position of such responsibility and visibility? ''Yes,'' he said, ''it did. For about a week. After that I lost any apprehension at all. She handles herself like a seasoned pro.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bianchi, an Atlanta native, has long been enamored of policy. In college, she wrote a senior thesis about welfare reform in Georgia. Her father is the founding headmaster of a progressive private school. Her mother is a developmental psychologist.</p>
        <p>She came to know the Gores through her ties to Ms. Schiff, and she spent time playing basketball at the vice president's residence and water skiing with the Gores in Tennessee. But several Gore aides said she had risen on the merits, and Ronald Klain, Mr. Gore's former chief of staff, said he first hired her without even knowing of her connections to the Gores.</p>
        <p>Campaigns, of course, are often populated with bright young people who are valued for their enthusiasm, their stamina  and their willingness to sleep on futons. Mr. Gore's research director, David Ginsberg, is 25. Michael B. Feldman, a senior adviser, is 31. Mr. Gore's national field director, Donnie Fowler, is 32, as is his speechwriter, Eli Attie. His press secretary, Chris Lehane, is 33.</p>
        <p>MS. BIANCHI, a fan of black pinstripes, fuels her days with candy bars and Diet Cokes. Her cell phone has become an appendage, and she acknowledges that she has no life outside the campaign. But youth, she suggests, can be overcome, particularly with a resume as deep as hers and a long list of mentors.</p>
        <p>''I feel comfortable,'' Ms. Bianchi said, ''that I've had a lot of experiences that, though they were quick, have built on each other.''</p>
        <p>She acknowledged feeling the doubts of her  colleagues in early strategy sessions, but said that Mr. Gore had helped establish her credentials.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure there have been meetings with senior staff where they come in and think, 'What is she doing here?' '' Ms. Bianchi said. ''But then he'll call on me and say, 'Sarah, tell us about that program.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bianchi's most important role, said several Gore aides, may be in fighting the temptation to push the campaign's rhetoric beyond the limits of its policies.</p>
        <p>''There have definitely been moments when far more important people than me were advocating a position that I was not,'' she said. ''You know, it's 'Why can't we say it this way?' and I have to say, 'Because it's not true.' And then they say, 'Well, can't we just make it true?' And you have to say 'no.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Schiff said that Ms. Bianchi was ''not afraid to be the buzz kill'' in staff meetings. ''When there's something that might play well politically,'' Ms. Schiff said, ''Sarah's always the reality check.''</p>
