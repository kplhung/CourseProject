        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* BLACK EYED PEAS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. To say they're energetic doesn't begin to describe it; the three Los Angeles hip-hoppers in Black Eyed Peas simply put on one of the most dynamic shows in the genre. Dancing, freestyling, beat-tossing, it all happens in overdrive at a Black Eyed Peas show. This one offers music from the group's long-awaited second album, ''Bridging the Gap'' (Interscope), which features luminaries like DJ Premier, Macy Gray, De La Soul and the omnipresent Wyclef. If any special guests show up, they'll have to compete for the spotlight with their boisterous hosts. Sunday night at 9; admission is $20 (Ann Powers).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* BLACK EYED PEAS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. To say they're energetic doesn't begin to describe it; the three Los Angeles hip-hoppers in Black Eyed Peas simply put on one of the most dynamic shows in the genre.

If any special guests show up, they'll have to compete for the spotlight with their boisterous hosts. Sunday night at 9; admission is $20 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>JIM BLACK'S NO AXIS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. The drummer whose rhythms -- itchy, rushed, original -- defined a big chunk of downtown improv since the mid-90's, playing with Tim Berne, Pachora, Tiny Bell Trio and others, has his own band now; besides his seemingly constant partner, the saxophonist Chris Speed, it also includes the bassist Skuli Sverisson and the guitarist Hilmar Jensson. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $10 (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MICHAEL BLAKE'S FREE ASSOCIATION, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Blake -- probably best known as the saxophonist from the Lounge Lizards -- has a lot at his disposal: he's got a big sound, a familiarity with music from both hemispheres, and he thinks his way through improvisations rather than simply shifting around matrices of licks. This band includes the pianist Frank Kimbrough, the bassist Ben Allison and the drummer Mike Mazur, all moving parts of the refreshingly idea-rich Jazz Composers Collective scene. Tomorrow at midnight; admission is $4 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>BULGARIAN WOMEN'S CHOIR ANGELITE, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. The Bulgarian Women's Choir Angelite isn't the same group that made the ''Mystere des Voix Bulgares'' albums, but it represents the same Bulgarian tradition: singers steeped in folk music assembled as a chorus, performing 20th-century compositions based in regional music. The singers harmonize with sustained, celestial purity or eerie dissonance; they swoop from near silence to chordal shouts, and pungent individual voices leap out of the ensemble. Sunday night at 7; tickets are $30 and $40, $15 for students (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>CARL CRAIG, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The disc jockey and producer Carl Craig started out with techno music in Detroit; since then he has broadened his music to include anything from jazz to abstract electronic swooshes and thuds. He tops a bill that also includes Moodyman, who's a techno minimalist, and DJ Hannah. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $25 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* STEVE DAVIS QUINTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. This ought to be good; the trombonist Mr. Davis has been working hard with Chick Corea's band lately, and the association has also resulted in Mr. Davis's new solo album, ''Portraits in Sound,'' on Mr. Corea's record label, Stretch. Mr. Davis's main accomplice on the record, the vibraphonist Steve Nelson -- a laconic wizard on the instrument whom musicians love -- will be there, as well as the pianist David Hazeltine, the bassist Dwayne Burno, and the drummer Eric McPherson. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $15; two-drink minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>TEDDY EDWARDS QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. One of the best could-have-been-a-contenders in jazz history, Mr. Edwards has roots in black Los Angeles and in the exciting tenor-saxophone dialogues he recorded with Dexter Gordon in the late 1940's. Like many others who stayed on the West Coast and plunged into studio and soundtrack work, he didn't get quite the recognition he deserved. But he remains tall, trim and hale, and he's worth hearing. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover the 8 and 10:30 shows, $18 for the midnight show; Sunday night at at 7 and 9, with a $18 cover; there is a $10 minimum for all shows (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>GONG, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. In the 1960's, Daevid Allen was part of a coterie of arty rockers in Canterbury, England, who ended up forming groups like Soft Machine, Caravan and National Health. Mr. Allen came with Gong, a group that combined a genial mythology -- with pothead pixies flying around in teapots -- with music full of jazzy phrases and psychedelic loops and echoes. Tomorrow night at 9; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* GRUPO MONO BLANCO, Washington Square Church, 135 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 545-7536. The son jarocho, from Veracruz in Mexico, is a three-chord miracle: string-band music, for harp and various-size guitars, that sounds like a music box with steely, three-against-two syncopations and the gift of improvisation. Grupo Mono Blanco plays sones jarochos (including ''La Bamba'') and, adding another layer of rhythm, dances the zapateado, which looks like a hybrid of flamenco and clog dancing. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20, $15 for students (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* TOSHI KUBOTA, S.O.B.'S, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. The foot of Mount Fuji isn't where you'd expect a soul singer to receive his lightning bolt of inspiration, but that's what happened to Toshi Kubota, who grew up in Shizuoka, Japan. This crooner moved to New York a few years back to get his groove on with collaborators like Rafael Saadiq and Angie Stone, but he retains his international flair (although singing in English) on his fine new album, ''Nothing but Your Love'' (Sony/Epic). Stylish cosmopolitans, take note. Tonight at 9; admission is $18 (Powers).</p>
        <p>PAT McGEE BAND, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The Pat McGee Band is on the country end of the jam-band spectrum. Its benevolent, unhurried songs have the lilt of the early Doobie Brothers, topped with close-harmony vocals. It shares the bill with Great Big Sea, from Newfoundland, whose robust, fiddle-driven songs are kin to sea chanteys, jigs and reels, and with the jam band Cravin' Melon. Tonight at 8; tickets are $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MOCEAN WORKER, Limelight, 660 Sixth Avenue, at 20th Street, Chelsea (212) 807-7780. Mocean Worker, alias the disc jockey and producer Adam Dorn, likes a happy dance floor. He delves into old funk, disco and Latin percussion alongside house beats and the buzzes and blips of analog synthesizers, making tracks that are lighthearted and inviting rather than pushy. Tomorrow night at 1 a.m.; admission is $25 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* MARISA MONTE, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. One of Brazil's most popular singers, Marisa Monte has a melting mezzo-soprano voice that never runs out of breath and a repertory that runs from Caetano Veloso to the Velvet Underground. Her sets jump north and south, following up bluesy American rock with songs that have deep Brazilian roots, insisting that modernity has nothing to do with letting go of roots. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $35 and $45.</p>
        <p>MAE MOORE, Fez, 380 Lafayette at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. A Canadian songstress with a voice clear as mountain-stream water, Ms. Moore has gone through the usual dramas: major label semi-success and subsequent abandonment, a period of retreat and a new start on an independent (in Ms. Moore's case, the indie is Big Hips, owned by fellow Canadian Jann Arden). Her recent songs are suitably grown-up and down-to-earth. Tonight at 8; admission is $15 (Powers).</p>
        <p>MARIA MULDAUR, B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Maria Muldaur has been many places at many times other than ''Midnight at the Oasis,'' but that song remains her inescapable trademark. It's too bad, in a way, because the ditzy sexpot the singer plays in that infectious hit offers an extremely partial picture of her talent. Since the spotlight left her, she's become a highly praised mainstay on the blues scene; her latest albums pay tribute to her old friend the late pianist Charles Brown, and the dirt-wise sound of the Mississippi Delta. This performance should show her range. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $20 (Powers).</p>
        <p>NORTH MISSISSIPPI ALL-STARS, THE SUGARMAN 3, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. The North Mississippi All-Stars want to update the down-home. They studied the clatter and lurch of backwoods Mississippi juke-joint blues with its older generation and learned some of the secrets of its sputtering, lurching momentum. They set out to combine the old blues with jam-band Southern rock. The Sugarman 3 is a funk band. Tonight at 8; admission is $12 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>BOBBY PREVITE'S COUNTERCLOCKWISE, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A new trio for this hard-working, groove-loving, concept-hatching drummer who has written tons of his own music in a 15-year recording career. It includes the bassist Cameron Brown and the saxophonist Tony Malaby. Tonight through Sunday night, sets are at 8 and 9:30; tickets,  $10 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* DEWEY REDMAN QUARTET, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Since his original days as Ornette Coleman's foil in the late 60's Mr. Redman has often displayed the quality Mr. Coleman has all but gotten rid of: the late-night blues part. Solo to solo he's unpredictable in good ways, and his playing is so wise and startling that even his cameos on other people's records are memorable. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 show tonight and tomorrow night; cover is $20 tonight and tomorrow, $18.50 on Sunday; there is a $10 minimum for all shows (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>WALLACE RONEY QUINTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. The best parts of this trumpeter's playing are the interior moments, when he's parsing phrases before he produces them and offers you their shy essences. He knows how to create improvised form with a band, too; that's why his performances are considerably better than his records. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>OTIS RUSH, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, below 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Good-time blues are far away when Otis Rush is at his best. In his Chicago blues, there's pure pain seeking release: bitter, desolate singing and guitar lines that slice with ruthless, serrated fury. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9:30, 11 and 12:30; admission is $25 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SASHA AND JOHN DIGWEED, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-1600. A longing for rapture and transcendence is never far from the surface of dance music, particularly in the utopian pulsations set out by the English disc-jockey partnership of Sasha and John Digweed. In their marathon sets of trance music, steady repetition holds time at bay, and floating, whooshing sounds and voices suggest freedom from the rigors of form. Tonight doors open at 11, with Sean Cusick warming up, and John Digweed and Sasha continuing well past dawn. Admission is $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MARY STALLINGS WITH THE ERIC REED  QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. She's little known in New York, but Ms. Stallings has a few decades of experience on the West Coast, performing with Billy Eckstine and Count Basie, among others. Her voice, sturdy and nonvirtuosic, has a rich low end; its clearest template is Dinah Washington. And above all it's a jazz voice, not an R&amp;B voice; she's for real. The pianist Eric Reed and his clean, effective trio back her up. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30 and 11:30; cover is $20 on weekends and $15 on Sundays; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>SUN RA ARKESTRA, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The jolly Sun Ra experience continues under the direction of the saxophonist Marshall Allen, and as always, there's no way to know whether you're going to get long, loopy Sun Ra originals with African percussion instruments, Fletcher Henderson charts or old romantic ballads yelled through a megaphone. Tonight at 9 and 11; admission is $14 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* TINA TURNER/JOE COCKER, Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9300. At the center of a lavish rock spectacle, Tina Turner plays her archetype to the hilt. She's the indomitable woman, scarred but never defeated, strutting and singing in a voice that won't give in. Joe Cocker, still overwrought after all these years, heaves and twitches. Sunday night at 7:30. Tickets are $45 to $125 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>PHIL WOODS QUINTET, Iridium, 44 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. The prime sources for Mr. Woods, the alto saxophonist, are in bebop before it became canonized; there's a freshness and force in the continues phrases of his playing, and music school is probably the last thing it will remind you of. Sets through Sunday night are at 8:30 and 10:30; with additional sets tonight and tomorrow at 12:15 a.m.; cover charge is $25; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
