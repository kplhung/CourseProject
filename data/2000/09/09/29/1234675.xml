        <p>Microsoft said yesterday that its co-founder Paul G. Allen and the former Hewlett-Packard executive Richard Hackborne were resigning from the board. Mr. Allen and William H. Gates founded Microsoft 25 years ago to market the BASIC computer language to hobbyist computer users. Later, on the strength of a contract from I.B.M. to development MS-DOS, a simple personal computer operating system, Microsoft grew into the world's dominant independent software publisher. Mr. Allen, through his Vulcan Ventures, is a powerful force in new media and other technology companies. He left Microsoft in 1982 when he contracted Hodgkin's lymphoma, but had remained a board member. He owns 3.5 percent of Microsoft's stock.</p>
