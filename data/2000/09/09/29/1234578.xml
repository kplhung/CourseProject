        <p>Three broken ribs and a punctured lung sustained 42 days ago were supposed to end Mike Ammann's season. But he has recovered so well in such a short time that he will be the starting goalkeeper when the MetroStars play the Chicago Fire on Saturday night at Giants Stadium in Game 2 of the Major League Soccer semifinals.</p>
        <p>Ammann said he hoped to inspire his teammates to perform better than they did in their 3-0 loss at Chicago in Game 1 on Tuesday. The first team to compile 5 points in the series will advance to the M.L.S. championship game on Oct. 15.</p>

        <p>Three broken ribs and a punctured lung sustained 42 days ago were supposed to end Mike Ammann's season. But he has recovered so well in such a short time that he will be the starting goalkeeper when the MetroStars play the Chicago Fire on Saturday night at Giants Stadium in Game 2 of the Major League Soccer semifinals.</p>
        <p>Ammann said he hoped to inspire his teammates to perform better than they did in their 3-0 loss at Chicago in Game 1 on Tuesday. The first team to compile 5 points in the series will advance to the M.L.S. championship game on Oct. 15.</p>
        <p>''I know the Willis Reed thing, but I am a Kirk Gibson guy because I am a Dodgers fan,'' Ammann said after a grueling practice today at Kean University, evoking the former Knick center and the former Dodger outfielder who inspired their teams to championships by playing hurt. ''We need something because the guys are disappointed and embarrassed for what happened in the first game.''</p>
        <p>Ammann was expected to be out for the season after being injured in a collision with Mamadou Diallo of Tampa Bay on Aug. 16. He looked fine today, working with Phil Wheddon, the MetroStars' goalkeeping coach, and the team's other goalkeepers, Paul Grafer and Russell Payne.</p>
        <p>After that workout, Coach Octavio Zambrano tested Ammann for another 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Barring any extraneous circumstances, he will go Saturday,'' Zambrano said. ''I will have meetings individually with every player, but I think he's ready.''</p>
        <p>With Tim Howard playing for the United States Olympic team, the MetroStars have been without an established goalkeeper.</p>
        <p>Grafer stepped in and did a good job during the MetroStars' sweep of the Dallas Burn in the first round of the playoffs. Grafer was not at fault on the three goals in Chicago on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Except for Tab Ramos, who sustained a pulled groin muscle today and left practice early, all the MetroStars finished practice on a high note. ''I think it's going to be O.K.,'' Ramos said as he walked off the field. ''I just don't want to make it worse.''</p>
        <p>Zambrano and his players said they would have to be more aggressive than in Game 1. Chicago seemed to win every loose ball, and capitalized on counterattacks for two of its goals.</p>
        <p>''When it came down to 50-50 balls, we went 30 and they went 70,'' Zambrano said. ''Two of the goals came as a direct result of losing the ball in midfield.''</p>
        <p>Steve Jolley said: ''We have to raise our intensity a notch. I think you'll see more aggressiveness on Saturday because everyone is angry about the way we played in the first game.''</p>
        <p>Petter Villegas said the forwards need to convert their chances and not miss the way they did in the first game. ''We were there,'' Villegas said. ''It's just that we didn't score. Our forwards need to put the ball in the back of the net.''</p>
        <p>To avoid elimination, the Metrostars will have to be productive offensively and Ammann will have to be on top of his game.</p>
