        <p>Directed by Jason Priestley  Not rated; 90 minutes</p>
        <p>Readers who are not knowledgeable about pop music ought to know a couple of things about the group called Barenaked Ladies. When they perform, they are clothed. And at all times they are men.</p>
        <p>Barenaked Ladies is a Canadian band that started on the streets of Toronto and in the course of a decade built a devoted following with an ingratiating combination of rock, jazz and folk music; plenty of good-natured humor, intelligence and an unpretentious attitude.</p>
        <p>As one of their fans says in the new documentary ''Barenaked in America,'' ''They look like guys you see working in the Gap.''</p>
        <p>''Barenaked in America,'' directed by Jason Priestly, best known as the actor who played Brandon Walsh in ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' is an unabashed valentine to the band, which consists of Ed Robertson and Steven Page, who sing and play guitars; Jim Creeggan, who sings and plays double bass and bass guitar; Kevin Hearn, who plays keyboards, accordion, electric guitar and sings; and Tyler Stewart, who plays drums and sings.</p>
        <p>The film, which opens today at the Loews State (Broadway at 45th Street), has cameo appearances by the comedian Jon Stewart, the actor Jeff Goldblum and the television host Conan O'Brien and many a jocular reference to Canada's cornucopia of show-business talent. It follows the Barenaked Ladies on a tour of the United States as the band attempts to raise its visibility south of the border.</p>
        <p>So, as the group plays places like Buffalo, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston and New York, the camera documents its members individually and collectively, in performance and behind the scenes, and as they deal with Mr. Hearn's battle with leukemia.</p>
        <p>From time to time, their business associates and experts on Canadian pop music discuss the talent and career arc of Barenaked Ladies, but the band and its music are the principal focus.</p>
        <p>''Barenaked in America'' may not be dispassionate filmmaking, but it is certainly entertaining.</p>
