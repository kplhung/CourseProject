        <p>R. S. Thomas, a Welsh clergyman and poet whose spare, often bleak verse reflected the rugged people and landscape of his native land, died on Monday at his home in Llanfairynghornwy, Anglesey, Wales. He was 87.</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Thomas's poems were evocative sketches of the Welsh countryside. In ''Tares'' (1961), he included a poem titled ''Abersoch,'' in which he captured a moment at the seashore:</p>
        <p>There was that headland, asleep on the sea,</p>
        <p>The air full of thunder and the far air</p>
        <p>Brittle with lightning; there was that girl</p>
        <p>Riding her cycle, hair at half-mast,</p>
        <p>And the men smoking, the dinghies at rest</p>
        <p>On the calm tide. There were people going</p>
        <p>About their business, while the storm grew</p>
        <p>Louder and nearer and did not break.</p>
        <p>In the course of some 40 years as a priest, mostly in the hill country of northern Wales, he came to identify with the villagers who struggled to wrest their livelihood from an unforgiving land, people he described as ''tough, materialistic, hard-working'' who ''measured one another by the acre and by the pound.''</p>
        <p>Strongly nationalistic, he deplored what he saw as the cheapening of Welsh culture by a steady infiltration of vacationers from England and elsewhere and the growing triviality and commercialism of contemporary life. His vision remained uncompromising. In ''Funeral,'' from ''The Bread of Truth'' (1964), he wrote:</p>
        <p>. . .On the cheap coffin</p>
        <p>The earth falls more cleanly</p>
        <p>than tears.</p>
        <p>What are these red faces for?</p>
        <p>This incidence of pious catarrh</p>
        <p>At the grave's edge? He</p>
        <p>has returned</p>
        <p>Where he belongs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas was well into his 30's when he mastered the Welsh language, although he continued to write his poems in English and saved his Welsh for prose. He published his first book of poetry, ''The Stones of the Field,'' in 1946, followed by ''Songs at the Year's Turning'' (1955), ''Poetry for Supper'' (1958) and ''Tares'' (1961). His later works included ''Laboratories of the Spirit'' (1976), ''Mass for Hard Times'' (1992) and ''No Truce With the Furies'' (1995).</p>
        <p>Ronald Stuart Thomas was born in Cardiff in 1913 and grew up in Holyhead, Anglesey, in northwest Wales. He was ordained a deacon in 1936 and became a priest in 1937. After retiring from the priesthood, he turned to prose, publishing a series of biographical essays.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas's first wife, Mildred Eldridge, an artist, died in 1991. He is survived by his wife, Elisabeth, and a son from his first marriage.</p>
