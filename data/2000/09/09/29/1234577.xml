        <p>The head coach stalked off the practice field after a heated address to his players. A top receiver carefully worded his frustrations over the sputtering passing game.</p>
        <p>As recently as Wednesday, Giants players were confident that they left Sunday's loss to the Redskins behind and were looking ahead to the Tennessee Titans. Apparently, some frustration is still lingering.</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel and receiver Amani Toomer each used different methods today of voicing their displeasure. Fassel ripped into his team following practice, criticizing players for a poor attitude as they gathered after practice.</p>
        <p>''I'm just upset about some things,'' Fassel told reporters. The coach, using profanities, said he was irritated at the team's casualness and challenged players to join him in his displeasure.</p>
        <p>Fassel, whose job status was an issue before the Giants began the season, did not say what upset him, but when asked if players were complacent, Fassel replied: ''I don't know. Maybe. I'm going to shake it out of them, though.''</p>
        <p>Fassel indicated players had not learned from their failings in a 16-6 loss to Washington Sunday and said his displeasure from that game was still festering, and it surfaced today.</p>
        <p>Players agreed, to an extent. While maintaining that they were upset with their performance against Washington, they struggled to pinpoint what went wrong in today's practice.</p>
        <p>''I agree with him 100 percent,'' free safety Shaun Williams said. ''We just lost last week. We need to come out this week with some fire and some spark and get ready to play. We should be angry that we played that bad. He shouldn't have to say anything, but he obviously didn't think we were that motivated out there today and we didn't have the right attitude.''</p>
        <p>Kerry Collins said the Giants' lapses were limited to the end of practice, but added that the team was tight entering the game against Washington and played tighter when it fell behind.</p>
        <p>Fassel's voice was a constant companion to players during the practice, which ran beyond its normal two hours. He barked several times and yelled at players joking following a penalty: ''Don't laugh. I don't think it's funny.''</p>
        <p>Strong safety Sam Garnes said Fassel has been riding players all week. ''I know people around here, they're definitely going to respond,'' Garnes said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Toomer suggested the passing game should be more aggressive.</p>
        <p>''I can't complain,'' Toomer said. ''We're 3-1, but I feel there's some games that wouldn't have been as close if we used the pass more.''</p>
        <p>Toomer's 79 receptions last season set a Giants team record, and he led the team with six touchdowns, including catches of 61 and 80 yards. He had four 100-yard games.</p>
        <p>This season, Toomer has 19 catches but is averaging just 9.1 yards a reception, down from his 15-yard average last year. The passing game has not been the wide-open attack envisioned by Sean Payton, the new offensive coordinator. He said much of Sunday's problems stemmed from failures on first down, which created long-yardage situations. Fassel this week stressed using more deep passes.</p>
        <p>''I definitely want to be involved,'' Toomer said. ''I want to be a part of it. It doesn't really matter that much. It's just that I feel I can help the team if I get the ball in my hands.''</p>
        <p>Today was a day of mini-dramas. Kicker Brad Daluiso tried convincing listeners that he would be ready to play Sunday despite being held out of practice with a stiff back. Daluiso said his back stiffened on Wednesday but did not bother him during practice, and he only stayed off the field today at the suggestion of trainers so as not to aggravate it.</p>
        <p>''I'm kicking,'' Daluiso said. ''My back is fine. I can go kick right now.''</p>
        <p>Fassel, in his sub-two-minute address to reporters, sounded more ominous. ''I've already made contingency plans,'' he said without elaborating.</p>
        <p>Brad Maynard, the punter and holder, would be the emergency kicker if Daluiso went down in a game, but Maynard has never attempted a kick in a National Football League game and the Giants would be more likely to bring a kicker in if Daluiso was questionable for Sunday.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Tennessee added linebacker GREG FAVORS (ankle) to its injury report, making nine Titans questionable for Sunday's game. The Giants expect most of them to play, with the notable exceptions of receiver YANCEY THIGPEN (hamstring) and tight end FRANK WYCHECK (concussion).</p>
