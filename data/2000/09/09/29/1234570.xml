        <p>Donald P. Jacobs, one of the most influential people in management education, will step down next spring after a quarter-century as the dean of Northwestern University's business school, the university announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs, 73, has served longer than any current major university president or other business school dean, higher education experts said.</p>
        <p>Since taking over in 1975 -- reluctantly, and only after three other candidates turned down the job -- Mr. Jacobs oversaw changes that many rival schools have since imitated. The Kellogg Graduate School of Management, as it is now known, built an executive education center, complete with a hotel, that has brought a financial windfall to the school. Kellogg was also among the first business schools to interview all of its applicants and to encourage students to play a major role in designing the curriculum.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Jacobs said yesterday, people began to see that the ideal student -- and executive -- is not a rugged individual but rather ''one who is a team player and plays a number of leadership roles on campus.''</p>
        <p>During his tenure, Kellogg also climbed in the rankings published by national magazines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs was a banking expert on the school's faculty before becoming the dean. He also served as the chairman of Amtrak in the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>He said he began to consider retirement after he became ill last spring, and though he has recovered in recent months, he still decided to step aside. ''It means I can go back and be a professor again before time runs out,'' said Mr. Jacobs, who now teaches management.</p>
        <p>Northwestern said it would appoint a search committee and consider both internal and external candidates.</p>
