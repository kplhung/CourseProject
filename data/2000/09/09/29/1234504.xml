        <p>MARTIN BAUMAN  Or, a Sure Thing  By David Leavitt  387 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $26.</p>
        <p>Martin Bauman, the title hero of David Leavitt's new novel, bears more than a passing resemblance to his creator. Like Mr. Leavitt, he grew up on the West Coast and came east to attend an Ivy League college. Like Mr. Leavitt, he published a story while still in his early 20's in The New Yorker (or, in Martin's case, a magazine much like The New Yorker), worked briefly at a publishing house and went on to achieve a measure of renown as a novelist and short-story writer.</p>

        <p>MARTIN BAUMAN  Or, a Sure Thing  By David Leavitt  387 pages. Houghton Mifflin. $26.</p>
        <p>Martin Bauman, the title hero of David Leavitt's new novel, bears more than a passing resemblance to his creator. Like Mr. Leavitt, he grew up on the West Coast and came east to attend an Ivy League college. Like Mr. Leavitt, he published a story while still in his early 20's in The New Yorker (or, in Martin's case, a magazine much like The New Yorker), worked briefly at a publishing house and went on to achieve a measure of renown as a novelist and short-story writer.</p>
        <p>''Martin Bauman; Or, a Sure Thing'' is told in the first person and set down in an intimate, confessional voice reminiscent at once of Philip Roth's ''Ghost Writer'' and Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited'': a voice inclined toward nostalgia and rumination, a voice sure to remind readers at times of the supple sonorities of Mr. Leavitt's brilliant debut collection of stories, ''Family Dancing'' (1984).</p>
        <p>This novel, however, divides peculiarly into two halves. The first, both heartfelt and polished, stands as a classic Bildungsroman about a young man's coming of age and provides as poignant and funny an account of literary apprenticeship as that found in the opening pages of William Styron's ''Sophie's Choice.'' It focuses on Martin's contentious relationship with his former writing teacher, the irascible Stanley Flint, and his subsequent efforts to achieve independence from his onetime mentor.</p>
        <p>The second half of ''Martin Bauman'' is an altogether messier, more haphazard production -- a rambling, self-indulgent chronicle of Martin's romantic difficulties and the intramural squabblings of his best friends. These latter pages, like the slush-pile manuscripts Martin reads at the publishing house, echo ''in their coarse sincerity'' the ''confessional talk shows'' of the 90's: Martin rambles on here at wearying length about everything from his endless sessions of television-watching to his medical treatment for genital warts.</p>
        <p>We feel as if Mr. Leavitt were allowing us to eavesdrop on Martin's whining therapy sessions instead of giving us a shapely account of his hero's travails. It's a criticism echoed by Martin's friend Seamus, who says he wishes Martin would ''get over his obsession with stupid little picayune domestic details.'' Did Tolstoy write about masturbation? Seamus wonders. Did Shakespeare?</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, these later sections of the novel illustrate some of the very things that an editor criticizes in Martin's stories: the ''tone is sometimes condescending'' and ''there aren't any likable characters'' -- that is, ''characters with whom we can sympathize, whose points of view we want to share.'' Martin's warmly observed portrait of his mother and the comical portraits of his roommates give way, as the book progresses, to carping descriptions of people the reader has no reason to want to get to know.</p>
        <p>Martin portrays his boyfriend, Eli, as a grievance-hoarding hothead and dogmatic gay ideologue who won't even go to his best friend's wedding because she is marrying a man instead of a woman, and he depicts their mutual friend Liza as a self-absorbed careerist who does little but obsess about her sex life. Their acquaintances in the literary world are equally tiresome: a collection of phonies, self-promoters and hypocrites, who seem more interested in gossip and in social climbing than in writing.</p>
        <p>As for Martin himself, he evolves from a callow young man, likable in his bumbling efforts to excel, into an openly ambitious, even opportunistic fellow who clearly tries the patience of just about everyone, including the author. He is needy and possessive in his relationship with Eli, throwing a histrionic fit when Eli spends an evening comforting a distraught friend instead of staying home with him; later, he will cavalierly cheat on Eli with an assortment of other men.</p>
        <p>When it comes to his career, Martin can be similarly self-serving, courting literary success the same way he once strove to get straight A's in school. When Flint speaks disparagingly of Martin's novel in progress, Martin tries to get his former teacher in trouble by ratting him out to his boss, suggesting that Flint's womanizing may be cause for dismissal.</p>
        <p>It is Martin's relationship with Flint that serves as the primary motor behind this book. Flint not only represents a father figure whose blessings signify the approval of the grown-up world that the young Martin so desperately craves, but he also embodies all the glamour and sophistication that Martin projects onto the literary world in New York City.</p>
        <p>In the opening sections of the book, Mr. Leavitt does a dexterous job of delineating Flint's aura: his mythic reputation among young writers; his use of cruel put-downs and over-the-top praise to maintain a hold over his students; his rigorous, unforgiving aesthetic. He also uses Flint's contentious, emotionally fraught relationship with Martin -- much the way he used the relationship between the concert pianist Richard Kennington and his protege, Paul Porterfield, in ''The Page Turner'' (1998) -- to show his hero's ambivalent progress toward adulthood and autonomy.</p>
        <p>When Flint recedes into the background in the second half of the book, much of the novel's energy is lost, as the reader is abandoned to the narcissistic navel-gazing of Martin and his friends. But while this portion of ''Martin Bauman'' is sorely in need of some editing, while this part of the book points up Mr. Leavitt's difficulties with the long-distance form of the novel, the voice he uses in much of this volume -- confiding, meditative and pliant -- marks his rediscovery of one of his greatest strengths as a writer, and it points the way toward more satisfying achievements.</p>
