        <p>BACK in Norway, they heard about the victory tour, the commercials, the sponsorships, when the United States won the Women's World Cup in 1999.</p>
        <p>''The United States has more money,'' said Silje Joergensen, who plays defense for Norway. ''They are rich.''</p>
        <p>The Norwegian players did not sulk about losing to the Americans as they went back to their jobs, playing for local clubs for a few extra kroner. The countries are different. The cultures are different. The economies are different.</p>
        <p>And besides, the Norwegians have been known to beat the United States more than occasionally -- and even ticked off the Yanks with a choreographed choo-choo train celebration after winning in their semifinal of the 1995 World Cup in Sweden.</p>
        <p>''Archenemies'' is the word Tiffeny Milbrett once used to describe the Norwegians, although last night the effervescent Milbrett was saying, ''Gosh, you've got to give them credit.''</p>
        <p>Hearing word of the way corporate and hometown America fell for the women last summer, the Norwegians could only remind themselves that their time would come around again.</p>
        <p>It arrived in the final of the Summer Games last night when Norway outlasted the United States, 3-2, in sudden death. Norway is the only nation to hold an advantage over the Americans, 15 victories to 13 losses with 2 ties.</p>
        <p>''Money is not everything,'' Joergensen said. ''We showed that tonight.''</p>
        <p>The two old rivals, who have been storing up bruises and cuts, grudges and resentments, in the decade and a half of this sport in the Olympics, staged a classic game, as good as sport gets. The United States tied the game in the dying seconds of regulation time, and then Norway clutched the victory in the 12th minute of overtime.</p>
        <p>The leaping header by the 5-foot-2-inch Milbrett was as stunning as Mookie Wilson's eccentric at-bat in the 1986 World Series. And the stunning overtime goal was as dramatic as Bill Mazeroski's home run that ended the seventh game of the 1960 World Series -- and more controversial because it involved a potential hand ball by a Norwegian forward.</p>
        <p>Fans will debate how Hege Riise's perfect lofting pass was touched by Joy Fawcett and then bounced onto the chest/shoulder/upper arm of Norway's Dagny Mellgren, who lashed a grass-cutter under the fingers of Siri Mullinix.</p>
        <p>The referee, Sonia Denoncourt of Canada, showed common sense in deciding that Mellgren had not blatantly positioned her upper arm to control the ball.</p>
        <p>Would the call have gone that way in the jingoistic confines of the Rose Bowl in 1999? The Yanks got the benefit of the doubt when goalkeeper Briana Scurry leaped forward -- in violation of the rule -- to smother a Chinese penalty kick. Last night, Norway won on neutral turf, with many Norwegians sprouting Viking horns and painting their faces red.</p>
        <p>These Americans and the Norwegians have become the Fraziers and the Alis of women's sport. When they become grumpy old women, they will still remember the mutual testiness.</p>
        <p>In 1991 the Yanks beat Norway, 2-1, in China to win the first World Cup. In 1995 the Yanks were offended when the Norwegians crawled around the field clutching the ankles of the players in front of them. And the Norwegians were not thrilled when the Yanks beat them,  2-1, in overtime in the semifinals of the 1996 Summer Games in Athens, Ga. But they usually come back.</p>
        <p>The two nations have produced the greatest offensive and defensive players in the history of the sport, Michelle Akers and Linda Medalen, the latter a detective who treated the Americans like suspected perps.</p>
        <p>Without them, the legend grows. Gro Espeseth, Norway's defender, who missed the 1999 World Cup because of knee surgery, was back last night, scoring on a header off the desperate flying foot of Shannon MacMillan. That goal gave the Norwegians a reprieve at 1-1.</p>
        <p>''I think we wanted it more,'' said Marianne Pettersen of Norway.</p>
        <p>Milbrett conceded that the Yanks have a problem when they play Norway.</p>
        <p>''With every other team, we play the way we want, but they know how to beat us,'' Milbrett said. ''We just played the best game of the tournament, and we're going home with a silver medal.''</p>
        <p>The Americans are also going home to a professional league that begins next April. And, yes, the Norwegians have heard about the chunk of change being spent.</p>
        <p>''I play soccer because I love it,'' said Joergensen, who is attending college to learn to teach retarded children. ''I would love to play soccer for money. I would go to the United States to play in that league.''</p>
        <p>She would be welcome. And she would be gracious enough to not mention the status of the Norwegian-American rivalry, at least not very often.</p>
