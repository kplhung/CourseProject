        <p>In a typical fairy tale, a frog is an enchanted creature just waiting for his true self to be revealed. In ''Boonah, Come Down,'' the frog is also on a quest, but his transformation is achieved through meditation, -- no princess's kiss required.</p>
        <p>If this doesn't sound like the Brothers Grimm, well, it's probably because they never explored Eastern philosophy. ''Boonah, Come Down'' is a Japanese story, and its United States premiere at the Kaye Playhouse will give Americans a look at adventures through a Buddhist lens.</p>
        <p>''The world is not constant, it's always changing,'' said Kazuto Ohira, the play's producer. ''That is the philosophy of Buddha. You have to pray for the peaceful mind.''</p>
        <p>Adapted by Tsutomu Mizukami from his 1972 children's book, ''Boonah, the Tree-Climbing Frog,'' and presented by the Seinenza Theater Company, a Japanese troupe, the play concerns a spirited young frog who wants to see the world from a treetop. But his journey proves dangerous as well as dazzling.</p>
        <p>Fifteen actors portray Boonah's story, using colorful costumes, animal masks, musical instruments and songs. (Audience members will hear a translation of the Japanese dialogue on headsets.) At two and a half hours including intermission, it is recommended for children over 10, but Mr. Ohira believes that younger ones may enjoy it, too.</p>
        <p>''This kid frog now knows that the world is complicated,'' he said. ''He must survive with other animals.''</p>
        <p>''Boonah, Come Down,'' through  Thursday at the Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, (212) 772-4448. Today and Tuesday through Thursday at 7 p.m.; tomorrow and Sunday at 3 p.m. (Sunday is sold out.) Tickets: $40; students, $15.</p>
        <p>Pikachu to the Rescue</p>
        <p>''Please be aware that strobe lights and pyrotechnics are used during the performance.''</p>
        <p>This warning could be the preamble to a magic show or a three-ring circus. What it actually precedes is a little bit of both: ''Pokemon Live!,'' the stage version of the Nintendo video game turned television series.</p>
        <p>The producers have good reason to worry about pulsating lights: when the strobe effects in an early episode of the ''Pokemon'' series were broadcast on Japanese television, hundreds of children were treated for seizures. No one seemed to be similarly afflicted on opening night of the live show at Radio City Music Hall, although children certainly had paroxysms of joy. (Think of a small-fry version of a Beatles concert.)</p>
        <p>From an adult's perspective (which hardly counts), it would have been gratifying if Norman J. Grossfeld, who conceived the show, and Michael Slade, who wrote it, had created some new themes. Much of the music is recycled from the television series, and the plot echoes that of the first Pokemon movie: a villainous attempt to take over the world by using Mewtwo, a pokemon, or pocket monster, with extraordinary powers (in this case, a robot version).</p>
        <p>The surprises are in the packaging: Ash and Misty, two of the heroes, have become adolescents rather than tweenagers, and their budding romance, only hinted at on television, is a major subplot. With its polished dance sequences, 18 songs and even a simulated helicopter landing, the production seems to be trying to be a grown-up Broadway show: ''Pokemon'' meets ''Footloose'' meets ''Miss Saigon.''</p>
        <p>But the young fans who stayed awake (the extravaganza is two hours long) didn't mind; they were too busy cheering Ash and his sidekick, Pikachu, and booing Team Rocket, the bumbling bad guys. So you may as well earn a badge of approval and take your own little Pokemon trainers: just buy lots of popcorn and make sure to see a matinee.</p>
        <p>''Pokemon Live!,'' through Sunday at Radio City Music Hall. Today at 4 and 7 p.m.; tomorrow at 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m. and 7 p.m.; Sunday at 10 a.m., 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. Tickets: $24.50 to $44.50. Information: (212) 247-4777. Ticketmaster: (212) 307-7171.</p>
        <p>Tunnel of Love</p>
        <p>Even as a college student, Robert Diamond had a child's love of digging underground. And in 1980 he found his treasure: an 1844 subway tunnel, the world's oldest, lying beneath Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>This weekend Mr. Diamond will offer tours of the tunnel, which he first heard about on local television. It was then believed to be a legend, but other digging (through city records) showed that a branch of the Long Island Rail Road had once gone beneath the Brooklyn streets.</p>
        <p>''The tunnel was half a mile long, because then downtown Brooklyn was only half a mile deep,'' Mr. Diamond said. When the train came out, he added, ''it was in the woods.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Diamond's 90-minute tours (visitors should take flashlights and wear comfortable shoes) will include local lore. The tunnel's demise came after the Civil War, when a real estate developer ''wanted to build a copy of the Champs-Elysees on Atlantic Avenue,'' he said. That never happened, but Mr. Diamond, a transportation consultant, hopes his own plan will: to make the tunnel part of a restored trolley line.</p>
        <p>Though languishing, the tunnel is both safe (''it was overbuilt, much like the Brooklyn Bridge,'' Mr. Diamond explained) and attractive. ''It was copied from Roman civil engineering practices,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Tours, tomorrow and Sunday at 11:30 a.m. and 1, 2:30 and 4 p.m., starting at the corner of Court Street and Atlantic Avenue, downtown Brooklyn, (718) 875-8993. (Look for the tent.) Tickets: $15; children, $10.</p>
