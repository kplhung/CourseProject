        <p>East-West</p>
        <p>Lured home by promises of Soviet citizenship, Russian emigres returned after World War II only to be caught in a Stalinist purge that led them to death and disaster. Aleksei Golovine and his rebellious French wife, Marie (Oleg Menchikov and Sandrine Bonnaire, left), are spared because he is a doctor who decides that his own good behavior is the best way to protect his family. With its old-fashioned American big-movie feeling, Regis Wargnier's moving film, A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, ''may justly be faulted for dissolving the horrors of history in the catharsis of melodrama, but it also uses the resources of melodrama to shed light on forgotten history.''</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36; DVD, $29.95. 115 minutes. French and Russian with English subtitles. PG-13. Release date: Oct. 3.</p>

        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36; DVD, $29.95. 115 minutes. French and Russian with English subtitles. PG-13. Release date: Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>U-571</p>
        <p>A damaged German submarine carrying a coveted code machine is forced to the surface, whereupon the device is captured by the Americans. But never count the Germans out underwater. One dirty trick deserves many others as the American crew, led by an untested young officer (Matthew McConaughey), battles to stay watertight while the director,  Jonathan Mostow, ''does an impressive job of moving his cameras around very cramped spaces and uncomfortably close to his actors'' (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>2000. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $26.98. 120 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>Joe Gould's Secret</p>
        <p>Ian Holm is ferociously front and center as the title character in Stanley Tucci's otherwise rather somnolent film adapted from Joseph Mitchell's New Yorker profiles of 1942 and 1964, ''Professor Sea Gull'' and ''Joe Gould's Secret.'' An unstable Harvard graduate, Gould came to New York in 1916 and started panhandling while supposedly beginning his masterwork, the million-word-plus ''Oral History of Our Time.'' Or so he maintained during raucous decades being the Greenwich Village character twice examined by Mitchell, played credibly by Mr. Tucci. But lacking dramatic tension, the film settles for being an atmospheric biography of someone's most unforgettable character. ''It could have been so much more'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. USA. $56.49; DVD, $24.95. 108 minutes. R.</p>
        <p>Final Destination</p>
        <p>About to take off with his classmates on a senior trip to Paris, Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a strong enough premonition of disaster to rear up from his seat and demand to be taken off the plane, which explodes on takeoff. For the rest of the film, he and several other survivors try to stay ahead of the grim reaper who, having been cheated once, is now picking them off one by one in a series of bizarre accidents. ''But even by the crude standards of teenage horror, 'Final Destination' is dramatically flat'' (Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. New Line. $117.30; DVD, $24.95. 110 minutes. R.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>THE PALLISERS. When it came to prolificacy, the Victorian novelist Anthony Trollope outdistanced Dickens. Here we have the first eight episodes of Simon Raven's adaptation of Trollope's six ''political'' novels, rendered in 26 parts for the BBC and broadcast on PBS during the 70's. The aging, unwed Duke of Omnium (Roland Culver) needs an heir. Should he take a young wife or leave the job to his nephew, Plantagenet Palliser (Philip Latham), and his bride, Lady Glencora (Susan Hampshire)? 1977. Acorn. $79.95, four cassettes, DVD, $79.95, four discs. 400 minutes. Information: (800) 999-0212.</p>
        <p>CAT ON A HOT TIN TIN ROOF, THE CAFETERIA and A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE. In the first of three PBS American Playhouse productions, Tommy Lee Jones, Jessica Lange, Rip Torn and Kim Stanley star in Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' (144 minutes). Bob Dishy portrays a refugee infatuated with a Holocaust survivor (Zohra Lampert) in Isaac Bashevis Singer's ''Cafeteria'' (53 minutes). In John D. Weaver's ''Matter of Principle'' (56 minutes), Alan Arkin and Barbara Dana play a cantankerous West Virginia scrooge and his wife. Monterey Media. $19.95 each. Information: (800) 424-2593.</p>
        <p>DOO WOP 50. Fifty minutes of hits from the 50's and 60's are performed by the Platters, the Skyliners, Johnny Maestro and the Brooklyn Bridge and the Capris. 2000. Rhino. Two cassettes, $19.98 each; DVD, $29.99. 150 minutes.</p>
