        <p>Catherine Deneuve is a little tired. It's been a long day, interview after interview. So much talking. She reaches into her purse, pulls out a sweetener pellet and drops it with a plink into the fresh cappuccino that has just been delivered to her hotel suite, the dregs of an ice-cold espresso pushed aside. She makes eye contact, that breathtakingly perfect, porcelain face leaning forward to take a good, solid pull on a thin, elegant cigarette.</p>

        <p>Catherine Deneuve is a little tired. It's been a long day, interview after interview. So much talking. She reaches into her purse, pulls out a sweetener pellet and drops it with a plink into the fresh cappuccino that has just been delivered to her hotel suite, the dregs of an ice-cold espresso pushed aside. She makes eye contact, that breathtakingly perfect, porcelain face leaning forward to take a good, solid pull on a thin, elegant cigarette.</p>
        <p>''It is very difficult, these long days of interviews,'' she said. ''You are always talking about the same film, over and over. And yet you must go on.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Deneuve, perhaps the most famous actress in French film history, has taken to dividing her time between lavish period epics and small  quirky independent films. None, however, have been quite as quirky as the one that took her to Beverly Hills for this long day of interviews.</p>
        <p>Her role as a factory worker in Lars von Trier's ''Dancer in the Dark'' began, she said, when she saw the director's ''Breaking the Waves'' several years ago and wrote him a letter. He wrote back, they talked about working together and, eventually, he offered her a role in this dark, downbeat drama -- part musical, part suicide note -- that won the top prize at Cannes this year and opened the New York Film Festival  this month to intensely mixed reviews.</p>
        <p>She loves the film, she said. She is very proud to be a part of it. But it is also clear that she would be happy to talk about something else for a while.</p>
        <p>''I find that I am watching too many films these days at home,'' she said. ''I much prefer to go to the cinema. There, where it is dark and the screen is so large, you can more focus your attention. At home, your attention can wander. And there is the sound, which I find is often the most important part of a film.''</p>
        <p>She is often shocked, she says, by the poor quality of the prints and the sound systems in the Left Bank cinemas that she frequents. ''Often, I will leave them a note to complain or even demand to talk to the manager,'' Ms. Deneuve said.</p>
        <p>On today's filmmakers: ''They are not quite like the directors from before, they are a different sort.''</p>
        <p>This is spoken with clear authority. Ms. Deneuve has worked with Francois Truffaut, Luis Bunuel, Jacques Demy, so many others, and she vividly remembers an age, now lost, of imposing, intellectual filmmakers. The directors today, they are a different sort.</p>
        <p>''I do not think the new directors are as interested in the storytelling as the older directors were,'' she  said. ''To them, it is more often always about emotion. Not the emotion of the characters on the screen, but the emotion in the audience. They are always trying to play on the emotion in the audience, to make them scared or happy or frightened, all the time. I think perhaps I would prefer a story.''</p>
        <p>Patience and 'Titans'</p>
        <p>Gregory Allen Howard had just about given up, figuring he was never going to make it as a film writer. ''When you hear no that much, you just begin to think, 'I guess they're right,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>After several years writing for sitcoms and dreaming of a career in movies, Mr. Howard thought a change of venue might help. He moved away from Los Angeles, which he says he hates, and settled in Alexandria, Va., near enough to  Washington to provide some urban sizzle but suburban enough to meet the slower, more comfortable life he craved.</p>
        <p>Surely, he could write from there as easily as from West Hollywood. But he was never able to make anything stick, he said, and was within inches of giving it all up and going back to school to get a teaching certificate. Then one day when he asked his neighbors why their corner of Alexandria seemed to be so much more happily integrated than any other part of the Washington area, they told him it was because of a high  school football team.</p>
        <p>''Virginia is second only to Texas in their fanaticism over high school football,'' Mr. Howard said. Two decades ago the city decided to merge two high schools, one that was predominantly black and one that was predominantly white. But when it came time to choose the head football coach for the new school, the administrators decided to go with a black coach, stunning the white community. And Mr. Howard's resulting film, ''Remember the Titans,'' with Denzel Washington playing the black coach, opens around the country today (review on Page 10).</p>
        <p>''This project was rejected by everybody, and I mean everybody,'' Mr. Howard said. ''I was turned down by every financing entity in the movie business.'' Then, one day, it fell into the hands of Jerry Bruckheimer Films, best known for big-budget action blockbusters but interested in starting up a new division for smaller films. ''And now, 18 months later, it's a movie,'' Mr. Howard said. ''I'm still getting used to the idea. Really, after having the idea rejected in so many places, all I really wanted was to get the project into development somewhere. But now it's a movie.''</p>
        <p>An Intimidating Father</p>
        <p>Jay Roach said he always envisioned ''Meet the Parents'' as a certain kind of movie, something along the lines of David Lynch's ''Eraserhead'' or Martin Scorsese's ''After Hours'' -- a movie in which an innocent man is drawn gradually deeper into a Kafkaesque nightmare that is partly, but only partly, of his own making. ''I always saw it as an anxiety dream,'' Mr. Roach said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roach, best known for directing the two ''Austin Powers'' comedies, said he had some trouble getting studio bosses to see him at the helm of a more character-driven comedy like ''Meet the Parents,'' which opens on Oct. 6. And it was only after Steven Spielberg had briefly flirted with the idea of directing the project and Jim Carrey had considered starring in it that it came back to Mr. Roach and Ben Stiller, the star Mr. Roach said he had always envisioned in the lead role. Not long after, Robert De Niro expressed an interest in playing the future father-in-law. ''We always knew it would be somebody kind of scary,'' Mr. Roach said.</p>
        <p>The idea was to have the hero engage in a string of small, white lies intended to ease his introduction to his future in-laws, only to have them grow and gradually ensnare him.</p>
        <p>''I always saw it as having this universal quality,'' Mr. Roach said. ''It's something that almost everyone has to go through, meeting your future spouse's parents. You're trying too hard, making stupid jokes, maybe bringing an inappropriate present, and you're previsualizing disaster at every step. Which, of course, only helps make it happen.''</p>
