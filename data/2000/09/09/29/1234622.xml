        <p>Federal regulators announced yesterday that they had tightened pollution standards for some dredge materials to be dumped off the New Jersey shore.</p>
        <p>The standards are critical because off-shore dumping remains the most viable way to dispose of dredge material, the soupy mud scooped off the sea floor to keep shipping channels  open.</p>
        <p>Advocates of tighter standards say they help reduce pollutants released into the ocean and ingested by sand worms, lobsters and other links in the food chain, but opponents fear that tighter standards could curb dredging and threaten the economy.</p>
        <p>The standards involve a 15-square-mile area 6 miles east of Sandy Hook, N.J., known officially as the Historic Area Remediation Site, or HARS, and commonly as the mud dump. The site was closed to most dumping in September 1997, following an agreement brokered a year before by Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>To cap highly contaminated material already dumped at the site, the agreement allowed some disposal of less contaminated material to continue. But elected officials and environmentalists, led by Representative  Frank Pallone Jr. and by Clean Ocean Action, a Sandy Hook-based environmental group, were angered when specific pollution standards growing out of the agreement were issued. Critics said those standards  allowed the dumping of materials that had higher levels of some pollutants than were present at the mud dump.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the federal Environmental Protection Agency announced it was tightening its standard for PCB's to 113 parts per billion, down from 400. The agency also said it would review its standards for other pollutants in dredge materials until July 15, 2001, and that it could alter other standards by October 2001.</p>
        <p>''We've decided to apply the revised PCB guideline now because PCB's were identified as a chemical of concern in the HARS designation,'' said Jeanne M. Fox, regional administrator for the E.P.A.. The agency made the announcement in conjunction with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which issues dredging permits and was also a party to the agreement.</p>
        <p>Representative Bob Menendez, a Democrat, who has tended to emphasize the importance of the shipping industry in debating the dredging issue, issued a statement urging a decision based on ''sound science and thoughtful review, not rhetoric.''</p>
        <p>Other supporters of dumping under the E.P.A. standards in place before yesterday include the International Longshoremen's Association and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The port agency issued a brief statement in response to yesterday's announcement, pledging to ''continue to abide by the federal guidelines for the use of dredged material to remediate the former mud dump site.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pallone, also a Democrat, called the announcement ''a major victory for the ocean and the New Jersey Coastline.''</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican, also welcomed the announcement, and offered to allow qualifying dredge material from New York to be dumped in New Jersey, where some material might be used to cap polluted sites.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Zipf, executive director of Clean Ocean Action, said the new PCB standard fell below the average level found in sand worms at the site, and is about at the average found in lobsters there.</p>
        <p>''It's a step in the right direction,'' Ms. Zipf said of yesterday's announcement. ''Mother always said it wasn't polite to say, 'We told you so.' But we are encouraged and feel some vindication in that the levels have been reduced.''</p>
