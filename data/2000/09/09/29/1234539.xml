        <p>Two systems for developing divers were on display at the Olympic Park Aquatic Center in Sydney, Australia, last night, and the results were as defining as Fu Mingxia's nearly flawless technique.</p>
        <p>Fu won the women's 3-meter springboard title by surpassing her Chinese teammate, Guo Jingjing, on the final two dives. With the victory, she joined two Americans, Greg Louganis and Pat McCormick, as the only divers to win four Olympic gold medals, and she became the first female diver to win five career medals. She also continued the Chinese dominance that has accounted for eight medals so far in this diving competition.</p>
        <p>The two-woman duel between Fu and Guo underscored the efficiency of a state system for identifying potential stars at a young age. Fu was a world champion at age 12, and was 13 when she won the platform gold at the Barcelona Games in 1992. Now 22, and back from temporary retirement, she is a mentor and tutor, as well as inspiration to a new generation. That includes Guo, an 18-year-old, who said Fu ''looks after all the young divers.''</p>
        <p>Among the women left behind last night were two United States divers, Jenny Keim of Miami, who was eighth, and Michelle Davison, who finished 12th and last. They are products of an American system that runs up against social and familial boundaries that inhibit excessive training regimens.</p>
        <p>''The Chinese and their system put a lot of miles on their kids,'' said Tim O'Brien, a United States assistant coach. ''They're so well trained and disciplined. Our kids are training three, four hours a day. Theirs train eight. The Chinese teach them beginning at age 7 or 8. For the most part, people in our country have resisted going in this direction.''</p>
        <p>Davison, a 20-year-old out of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said she would not want to go to such extremes for a sport she pursued because of her passion for it. ''It's such a different society,'' she said of the Chinese. ''To them, diving is their livelihood. In the States there are so many other things.'' That's also true for Keim, who plans to be in law school by the time the 2004 Summer Games are held in Athens.</p>
        <p>Still, the Americans couldn't help being impressed by Fu and the Chinese, for their consistency of effort and technique. ''They always look the same,'' Keim said. ''I don't really understand it.''</p>
        <p>Developing a stronger grass-roots program has been a priority of Bill Walker, who was elected in 1998 as president of U.S. Diving. Among the initiatives are a Future Champions Program, more regional training centers and a possible national training center.</p>
        <p>''We need to plant some roots,'' Davison said, ''and in eight, 10, 12 years, we'll be up there.''</p>
        <p>After sweeping the women's golds in 1996, Fu retired and entered college in Beijing. But she returned in July 1998, citing her love for the sport and concern that she was ''getting fat.'' Last night, at 106 pounds, she stayed close to Guo for three rounds, then edged ahead of her by just more than 1 point on the fourth. On the final dive, Guo faltered on a inward two-and-a-half somersault, and Fu locked up the gold with a clean entry on a reverse one-and-a-half somersault with two-and-a-half twists.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I have a lot of gold medals, but I don't consider myself special,'' she said afterward.</p>
        <p>WRESTLING: ANOTHER U.S. SURPRISE  Brandon Slay of Amarillo, Tex., eliminated the Olympic champion, Bouvaissa Saitiev, at 167 1/2 pounds in the third big American upset of a Russian wrestler in five days. Meanwhile, Cary Kolat of Rices Landing, Pa., won his first Olympic freestyle event, saw it protested, then lost the rematch to the world champion, Mohammad Talaei of Iran, 5-4, in the first round of 138 3/4-pounds competition. It was the third time in four years that a Kolat victory in a world-level championship was stripped by protest. (AP)</p>
        <p>CANOE-KAYAK: DOKTOR REINSTATED  Martin Doktor of the Czech Republic, the reigning Olympic champion in the 500- and 1,000-meter men's canoe events, was reinstated in the shorter event after an appeal. He was disqualified in Wednesday's heats for drifting too close to the leader. (AP)</p>
        <p>EQUESTRIAN: SHOW JUMPING TO GERMANS  Germany pulled off a narrow victory over Switzerland in the team show-jumping event, 15 faults to 16. Otto Becker put in the two clear rounds on Cento that the Germans needed to repeat the gold-medal performance from Atlanta. The bronze was decided by a jump-off, with Brazil beating out France. The United States finished sixth. (AP)</p>
        <p>FIELD HOCKEY: KOREA-NETHERLANDS FINAL  South Korea reached the men's field hockey final for the first time, defeating Pakistan, 1-0, when Song Seung Tae converted a penalty corner in the 56th minute. The Netherlands, the defending champion, needed a penalty shootout to defeat host Australia and also advance to the gold medal game. It ended 5-4 after Dutch goalkeeper Ronald Jansen made a diving save on a shot by Brent Livermore. (AP)</p>
