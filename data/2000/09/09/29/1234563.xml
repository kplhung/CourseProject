        <p>So you get home tonight and you get on AOL and you have a question about your bill or a technical glitch. You go to the AOL help section and get online with an AOL helper, who walks you through your problem, using e-mail back and forth. Do you know whom you're talking to? You're talking to a Filipino techie working in AOL's back office, which, thanks to a fiber-optic cable under the Pacific, is now located here at the former Clark Air Base outside Manila, beneath the Mount Pinatubo volcano.</p>
        <p>The AOL member services center in the Philippines employs 900 young Filipino techies, who, working on computers in three eight-hour shifts, now handle about 90 percent of the 600,000 online billing and technical questions that pour into AOL each month. ''I got this member online one day,'' said Christine Dizon, one of many Filipino AOL techies I interviewed here, ''and she asked me: 'Where are you?' And I said, 'I'm in the Philippines.' And she said, 'You're kidding me, right?' I told her, 'No, I'm really in the Philippines.' Sometimes people ask if we're machines. We tell them no, we're alive and kicking.''</p>

        <p>So you get home tonight and you get on AOL and you have a question about your bill or a technical glitch. You go to the AOL help section and get online with an AOL helper, who walks you through your problem, using e-mail back and forth. Do you know whom you're talking to? You're talking to a Filipino techie working in AOL's back office, which, thanks to a fiber-optic cable under the Pacific, is now located here at the former Clark Air Base outside Manila, beneath the Mount Pinatubo volcano.</p>
        <p>The AOL member services center in the Philippines employs 900 young Filipino techies, who, working on computers in three eight-hour shifts, now handle about 90 percent of the 600,000 online billing and technical questions that pour into AOL each month. ''I got this member online one day,'' said Christine Dizon, one of many Filipino AOL techies I interviewed here, ''and she asked me: 'Where are you?' And I said, 'I'm in the Philippines.' And she said, 'You're kidding me, right?' I told her, 'No, I'm really in the Philippines.' Sometimes people ask if we're machines. We tell them no, we're alive and kicking.''</p>
        <p>It was interesting to visit the two-year-old AOL Philippine center on the same day that in Prague a rogues' gallery of Communists, anarchists, protectionist unions and over-fed Yuppies out for their 1960's fix were denouncing globalization and trying to turn the World Bank-I.M.F. meetings into a molotov cocktail party. Because this AOL call center, one of many sprouting in the Philippines, is also globalization, and for 900 young Filipinos it's their salvation.</p>
        <p>There is a long waiting list for jobs here, which pay about triple the local minimum wage, and come with a 10-kilo bag of rice twice a month, plus health care and one meal a day. The Filipinos here also get free Internet phone and Web access, which many use for hours after work because they don't have home phones.</p>
        <p>''Some people are afraid of globalization because they fear being exploited,'' said Romer Recabar, an AOL techie, ''but what they are missing is that we can use this as a chance to learn. We have the technical know-how here, but AOL is bringing us the knowledge and resources we need to compete, and if we don't compete we perish. . . . My parents have a family business, but I work here so I can bring what I learn from an international company like AOL to our family business.''</p>
        <p>If AOL were not here, said Judith Jane Lyons, one of the thousands of tech grads produced by Filipino colleges each year, ''I would probably be unemployed or underemployed,'' because the number of good tech jobs is limited, so many end up working as clerks or in a factory, if they're lucky.</p>
        <p>''I was looking for a job for almost a year before I got in here,'' said Jojo Echo. ''I have two brothers and one sister. My father is not living, so I am the breadwinner. My mom is so happy on payday, because I give her almost half my salary.''</p>
        <p>You can imagine the pride it produces in young Filipino techies to know they are explaining to Americans and the world how to operate AOL services. There are only two American AOL managers here. All the other managers have been developed from the Filipino staff.</p>
        <p>''When people ask me where I work,'' said Soc Bautista, who has risen to training manager, ''and I tell them 'AOL,' they say: 'Wow! Really?' The pride it gives is immense. Our families share in the pride. Our families say, 'My kid works for AOL. . . .' This gives us the opportunity as a third-world country to improve and be at par [with others].''</p>
        <p>The AOL call center here is but one example of a simple truth -- that the best hope for alleviating poverty around the world is through more globalization, not less, and by encouraging governments to put in place the market-friendly policies, institutions and environmental protections that will attract global investment and jobs. The idea peddled by the Prague protesters that choking off this process will help the world's poor is sheer lunacy.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the people who should be saying that loudly, such as the World Bank head, James Wolfensohn, have become intimidated by the anti-globalization mob, whose only plan is to keep poor people poor. Think of the glib, moronic sign held up by protesters in Prague: ''Make Love, Not Trade.'' Very funny -- unless trade and foreign investment are your only lifelines out of poverty.</p>
        <p>Yo, protesters! Come here for a visit -- or get on AOL's help line and ask the Filipino techies what they think about globalization. Trust me, they'll give you an earful. Trust me, you've got mail.</p>
