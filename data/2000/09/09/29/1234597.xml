        <p>If history is written by the winners, Mexico may be in for a major rewrite.</p>
        <p>The president-elect, Vicente Fox Quesada, has promised to create a ''transparency commission'' when he takes office nine weeks from now. It could be a window into a panorama of secrets, a political Pandora's box.</p>
        <p>If opened, it could destroy the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which ruled Mexico for 71 years and controlled the flow of information, the archives of the state and the official version of history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox, the first man to defeat the PRI for the presidency, has said that the commission, which would have to be approved by Congress, would ''make an accounting of the past.'' Much must be accounted for: many chapters of the official version are false or full of holes, historians and politicians say.</p>
        <p>They say the comission would have to confront Mexico's biggest unsolved mysteries, like:</p>
        <p>What became of billions of dollars spent bailing out banks in 1995? Was the killing of the ruling party's presidential candidate in 1994 a political assassination? Who murdered many of the ruling party's most dangerous opponents during the 1970's and 1980's? And who gave the orders to shoot to kill hundreds of unarmed demonstrators -- a massacre that the leaders of the era still deny ever happened -- 10 days before the 1968 Mexico City Olympics?</p>
        <p>These are dangerous questions, for Mexico as well as for the PRI. ''There are truths which can kill a nation,'' the French author and diplomat Jean Giraudoux once said. And the truth might implicate a generation of past leaders -- including some former presidents.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if Fox will have the strength to do this,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a prominent political history professor. ''You have to open up thousands of closets, and each probably has more than one skeleton in it. It would be an encyclopedia of horror, of power that answered to no one.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox's advisers say that they cannot build public trust in government if the past remains a minefield of secrets and lies. If public opinion counts for something in Mexico -- and, increasingly, it does -- digging up these skeletons would be a popular undertaking, they believe.</p>
        <p>The transparency commission would be ''made up of citizens chosen by Congress who represent all sectors of society,'' who would ''carry out the investigations and present them to Congress,'' said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, a top adviser to Mr. Fox. Much about the idea remains unclear, including whether the citizens could subpoena witnesses or demand documents.</p>
        <p>He said that the power to rewrite the past must be in the hands of Congress, ''because an investigation by the executive branch lends itself to politicization and witch hunts.''</p>
        <p>''Society,'' he said, ''wants the past examined, but within these limits.''</p>
        <p>Those promises may not be enough for the old ruling party. Rafael Segovia, a political science professor and longtime PRI leader, said: ''Frankly, if I were Fox, I wouldn't do it. If he really wanted to seek justice, he would have to accuse thousands of people of crimes. But that is impossible.''</p>
        <p>The PRI was ''the perfect dictatorship'' -- with democratic trappings, but ''suppressing by all means, including the worst, whatever criticism may threaten its perpetuation in power,'' the Peruvian writer Mario Vargas Llosa said a decade ago. That included the Oct. 2, 1968, massacre of demonstrators in the Tlatelolco neighborhood of Mexico City.</p>
        <p>Though witnesses say 300 or more people died and more than 1,000 were wounded, the government never gave an accurate account of what happened. Government-printed history books erased the event. Luis Echeverria Alvarez, then interior minister, later president from 1970 to 1976, has long been suspected of having a hand in the killings and the coverup, but has never responded, beyond admitting in a rambling and evasive interview by a congressional committee in 1998 that the demonstrators were ''sons and daughters of workers, farmers and unemployed people.''</p>
        <p>Hector Aguilar Camin, a writer who led the failed effort to include Tlatelolco in the official histories, doubts that the transparency commission would have the strength to exhume the truth. ''It's got no teeth,'' he said. ''It's more of a politically motivated idea to satisfy partisans who want to see the government clean house once and for all.''</p>
        <p>Nor was Tlatelolco the last event of its kind. Kidnappings and killings of dozens of real and imagined enemies of the state continued during and after the cold war, at the hands of military and intelligence forces. The 1990's saw several massacres of men, women and children in the poorest regions of Mexico, where ''military personnel and police continued to commit serious human rights abuses,'' the State Department said in February.</p>
        <p>But one killing above all fires popular imagination in Mexico: the slaying of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's presidential candidate, in 1994. Like the official investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963, the government's lone-gunman theory in the Colosio case satisfies almost no one.</p>
        <p>Two weeks after the killing, a special prosecutor, Miguel Montes Garcia, said seven suspects ''carried out a concerted action'' to assassinate Mr. Colosio. The investigation then became lost in the labyrinth of Mexico's justice system, which has often proved incapable of doing justice.</p>
        <p>The financial system is a maze, too. The nation's banking laws protect not only the privacy of deposits, but also the secrecy of loans.</p>
        <p>Billions of dollars spent bailing out banks after the peso plummeted in 1994 are suspected to have benefited thousands of politically wired businessmen, whose bad debts will be paid by taxpayers. An independent auditor hired by Congress, Michael Mackey, found 3,300 such loans, totaling $7.8 billion, to the rich and powerful, according to opposition lawmakers who hired a computer hacker to dig up the data in late July.</p>
        <p>And the PRI, one of the world's great political machines until its defeat in the July elections, used the national treasury as a private purse for decades -- ''a small group in control of all political and economic power at the cost of the impoverishment of the citizenry,'' as Mr. Fox's party, National Action, said during the election campaign.</p>
        <p>But two big barriers stand in the way of the transparency commission. First, the PRI still controls a plurality of seats in Congress and could block or hobble the commission.</p>
        <p>''If the PRI perceives this as an onslaught undertaken with the purpose of destroying them as a party, as a way of life, they will recoil,'' said Denise Dresser, a leading analyst of Mexico's politics.</p>
        <p>And even if a search for the truth begins, the records of the past may not remain.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, when the PRI lost its majority in the lower house of Congress, opposition politicians eagerly went looking for the legislative archives. They were gone. The only thing that remained on the shelves was an old encyclopedia.</p>
