        <p>When Vice President Al Gore chose Senator Joseph Lieberman as his running mate, even many Jews wondered how an Orthodox Jew would reconcile his religious obligations with the demands of the job he was seeking. Would Mr. Lieberman take an official phone call on the Sabbath? Would he fly to Washington for a tie-breaking vote in the Senate?</p>
        <p>The senator explained in response that Talmudic scholars had advised him that certain work by public servants on the Sabbath was permissible. But such rulings tell a fascinating story, suggesting that Mr. Lieberman's candidacy, already hailed as a historic event in the history of American Jewry, could also serve as an important moment in Jewish religious law. That history is worth thinking about in this season of the Jewish New Year, beginning tonight, and in an era of internal divisions for Jews in the United States and Israel.</p>
        <p>Sabbath observance is broadly respected among Jews, not simply the Orthodox. The blanket biblical prohibition against working on the Sabbath has always allowed certain exceptions -- for example, when a life is at stake. Still another exception applied historically to a personage known as the shtadlan, the name for the Jewish representative in old European courts -- the court Jew. Because the shtadlan pleaded for the safety of Jews, his working on the Sabbath was deemed necessary, just as the Talmudic doctrine known as pikuah nefesh commands a doctor to work to save a life.</p>
        <p>But of course Mr. Lieberman is not a ''court Jew'' representing the interests of Jews -- a concept that became abused and discredited anyway. He is an observant Jew serving a largely secular and non-Jewish constituency, something that official Jewish law has dealt with only informally. Rabbi Norman Lamm, president of Yeshiva University, the leading Orthodox seminary in the United States, said that the ''court Jew'' precedent was irrelevant but that a Jewish requirement to respect what is known as tsorkhei rabbim -- the needs of the larger community -- could apply to Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>''If he does not take a call from [Russia's president, Vladimir] Putin on Shabbas [the Sabbath], he may be jeopardizing an American interest,'' said Dr. Lamm. But he added that if elected, Mr. Lieberman ''will have to decide these things ad hoc, but under general guidelines of Jewish law.''</p>
        <p>Such fine distinctions are central to Jewish law, life and identity. It will be interesting to see if rabbis and scholars agree that a larger ''American interest'' should become a factor in their interpretations of acceptable Sabbath work in the future, or whether some rabbis will insist on a more strict interpretation. Eventually, Mr. Lieberman's conduct could lead to a significant evolution in Jewish law and history.</p>
        <p>''You can use this as a barometer of how far the Jewish community has come,'' said Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, which serves the Conservative branch of Judaism. ''When Jews lived on the margin, they needed an advocate or defender. Now I would argue that the alleviation from Sabbath laws given to the shtadlan should be transferred to Jews who have moved into the public arena to serve the common good.''</p>
        <p>If Senator Lieberman leads the way on these questions, he may not want to talk about it. Recently he stirred up a furor by saying on the Don Imus radio program that there was ''no ban whatsoever'' on intermarriage. Many leading Jews criticized him -- don't try to be a rabbi, they said -- and the senator now acknowledges that he made a mistake. But Mr. Lieberman's personal attitude was clear when Mr. Imus asked him about the traditional prayer of many Orthodox Jews thanking God that they are not women. ''There is a prayer like that,'' he replied. ''For a long time, I've skipped that one. There's a certain amount of latitude here.''</p>
        <p>With the Jewish community as divided as it is between observant and non-observant Jews -- and between ''modern Orthodox'' Jews like Mr. Lieberman and more insular Orthodox Jews known as the Haredim -- such comments will probably continue to create a commotion. Strictly speaking, Orthodox Jews are uncomfortable with the idea of change in Jewish law, though Mr. Lieberman may be given dispensations by some rabbis for some acts in his official capacity.</p>
        <p>Jewish law itself cannot be changed until a universally recognized authority actually rules, citing reams of precedent and logical conclusions. Since late antiquity no such person or body has existed, and as a result, even among the Orthodox, what is permitted will inevitably be a matter of conflicting opinions among learned specialists. But it is not unreasonable to think that the reality reflected by Mr. Lieberman's situation may eventually find its way into the pages of Jewish legal writings.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Irving Greenberg, president of the Jewish Life Network, an educational foundation, and a friend and spiritual counselor of Mr. Lieberman, said Jewish law needed to take account of the full integration of Jews in American life. ''When the arbiters of Jewish law take responsibility for the revolutionary transformation of the Jewish condition,'' he said, ''then Jewish law will be able to guide those Jews who must take responsibility for the larger society.''</p>
