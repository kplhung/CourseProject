        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 26 note ''From the Editors'' about the Wen Ho Lee case did not review your coverage of two of the many troubling legal aspects of the case: the continuing denial of bail to Dr. Lee and the harsh conditions of his detention.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 14, Attorney General Janet Reno stated that ''Dr. Lee had the opportunity from the beginning to resolve this matter and he chose not to, and I think he must look to himself.'' That is a view more often heard from those who preside over the Communist criminal process; their cardinal maxim is ''leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 26 note ''From the Editors'' about the Wen Ho Lee case did not review your coverage of two of the many troubling legal aspects of the case: the continuing denial of bail to Dr. Lee and the harsh conditions of his detention.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 14, Attorney General Janet Reno stated that ''Dr. Lee had the opportunity from the beginning to resolve this matter and he chose not to, and I think he must look to himself.'' That is a view more often heard from those who preside over the Communist criminal process; their cardinal maxim is ''leniency for those who confess, severity for those who resist.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, other American officials admitted that Dr. Lee's detention was intended to stimulate his confession to spying by maximizing his discomfort.</p>
        <p>The lesson is a familiar one. In seeking to protect our national security against a Communist government, we must not depart from the values and practices that distinguish our society from theirs. You should have looked more carefully into these questions.</p>
