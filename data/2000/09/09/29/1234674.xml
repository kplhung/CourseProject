        <p>Benjamin M. Rosen, a pioneering figure in the personal computer industry and a founding investor in both Compaq Computer and Lotus Development, resigned yesterday as chairman of Compaq. Mr. Rosen, 67, who was a Wall Street analyst during the 1960's and 1970's, is credited with being one of the first analysts to spot the rise of the PC industry. He founded The Rosen Electronics Letter as president of Rosen Research, a technology consulting and publishing firm that he formed in 1980 and later sold to Esther Dyson. Mr. Rosen had stepped in several times to help reorganize Compaq and redirect the company's strategy, most recently last year. Compaq's chief executive, Michael Capellas, above, will now serve as chairman.</p>
