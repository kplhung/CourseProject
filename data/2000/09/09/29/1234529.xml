        <p>WITHIN the color labs of the world's 12 major paint companies, chemists continually tinker with formulas, searching for new effects that will dazzle and entice the auto-buying public.</p>
        <p>But they have always had trouble replicating the ever-changing hues of nature, like the metallic gold-green shimmer of a beetle or the rainbow glints inside a seashell. Now some paint makers are coming closer to matching nature's palette with a synthetic iridescence. Some new paints mysteriously change hues, depending on the viewing angle. Also showing promise as additives to automotive paints are microscopic glass beads, recycled mirror chips, volcanic dust and flakes of processed aluminum.</p>
        <p>Some exotic paint blends have already been tested for durability and long-term exposure at ''paint farms'' and have been presented to auto companies. Paint and pigment producers say glass-enhanced paints could be on a few production cars as early as mid-2002, although no automakers have announced their intentions.</p>
        <p>''There's a revolution going on in coatings, but it will show up in industrial products before it shows up in the auto industry,'' predicted James A. Kangas, co-founder of Hitech Environmental in Irvine, Calif. Hitech produces a volcanic glass that is to be added to Nippon Paint's automotive line in 2004. Glass particles, each far thinner than a strand of hair, create an optical effect when mixed into a base-coat paint. Colors appear purer, producers say, and metallic paints get added sparkle.</p>
        <p>The attention-getting paints are likely to appear first on cell phones, golf clubs, nail polish, decorative papers, helmets, textiles and faux leather. Automakers are likely to follow, since it takes years to test automotive products for durability and to make costly changes in production plants.</p>
        <p>''As effects expand into more products -- sporting goods, fashion, other industrial design -- it will be more acceptable on autos,'' said Jon R. Hall, color development manager for the BASF Corporation in Southfield, Mich., a leading auto-paint supplier.</p>
        <p>Alan E. Eggly, color and trim design manager for the Ford Motor Company, concurred. ''Great novelties that turn your head -- the majority don't want it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Among the most spectacular and costly effects are the color-shifting ChromaFlair pigments by Flex Products. ChromaFlair was first used in 1996 on 1,200 special Ford Mustang Cobras; collectors paid an extra $800 for the paint, which shifts from deep blue to purple-black depending on the viewing angle. This year, Nissan put the chameleon colors on two limited-edition European models. ChromaFlair is also in wide circulation in a nonautomotive application: On the face of the new $20 bill, the numerals in the lower right corner are inked with it.</p>
        <p>Ron Guilliams, a body shop manager in Fountain Valley, Calif., said he felt like a Hollywood celebrity in a General Motors EV1 that had been painted with a color-shifting paint called ''absolute purpleen.''  ''If you're having a bad-hair day, you wouldn't want to be driving this car,'' he said, alluding to the attention the electric-purple electric car attracted.</p>
        <p>Using technology originally developed for the military, where coatings are applied in films as thin as a few molecules, ChromaFlair is created in a five-layer sandwich. Light penetrates the top two layers, but only a portion of the color spectrum is reflected off the third layer. A color-shifting effect occurs on the contours of a painted object as it, or the viewer, moves. Depending on the angle at which a viewer is looking at a car, an array of colors may be seen.</p>
        <p>Color shifts like green-to-purple or magenta-to-gold are achieved by varying the layers' thickness. ''We call it 'color by physics' technology,'' said F. Jerry Droll, marketing manager for Flex, formerly a unit of Optical Coatings Laboratory, which has been acquired by JDS Uniphase. ''We think color by physics will become a mainstay in the auto industry as volume goes up.''</p>
        <p>Flex is backing that assertion with a $15 million expansion of a pigment factory in Santa Rosa, Calif.; it plans two new plants in Asia. ChromaFlair pigments are sold to paint makers like DuPont, BASF and PPG, which tinker with the formulations and market their own hue-shifting paints. Rivals like E. M. Industries plan to produce a competing color-shifting paint in Germany.</p>
        <p>The pigment is likely to find its initial market among custom-car enthusiasts, collectors of scale-model racecars and those willing to pay for a traffic-stopping promotion. The appeal will broaden as consumers see it used more widely, predicted Christina B. Dickey, color and trim manager for Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., citing the color-shifting paint used on a few cars in the refurbished Autopia attraction at Disneyland. ''I think customer interest will go up because of these Disneyland cars,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eggley, at Ford, also likes a new pigment called Xirallic, which E. M. Industries makes from processed aluminum flakes that are coated with metal oxides and give extra sparkle to paint.</p>
        <p>''It is the future, but not before the 2003 model year,'' said Sigrid F. Teaney, automotive manager for E. M., a unit of E. Merck of Germany.</p>
        <p>Several producers suggest that glass-infused paint will be readily adopted by automakers, who rely on new colors to make distinctions between makes and model years. At auto shows this year, General Motors, Ford and Isuzu displayed some concept cars -- design studies that are often future production vehicles in disguise -- that wore glass-chip and glass-bead paints.</p>
        <p>''There is definitely more sparkle, more wow factor,'' said Jon A. Moss, the manager of special vehicles for G.M. Glass paint poses no manufacturing or service hurdles and will be introduced gradually over the next three years, he said.</p>
        <p>Glass additives can lower a paint's cost and improve its durability. Glass-enhanced paint is cooler and easier to match and could make a vehicle more visible at night, said Bob Fritz, vice president in charge of Nippon Paint's color design studio. A supplier to Nippon Paint is Glaztec Inc. of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., which pulverizes recycled glass and mirrors by centrifuge into micron-sized chips.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fritz said that one carmaker had already picked seven glass-chip colors. ''By 2003, you'll see it on cars,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Two industry executives suggested that Toyota would be the first to use glass-chip paint on production cars, though Ms. Dickey, the company's trim manager, would confirm only that the paint was under study.</p>
        <p>In February, G.M. added glass beads 8 microns wide -- about a tenth of the diameter of a human hair -- to its approved pigment list, said David E. Burnett, president and co-founder of Prizmalite Industries, which supplies beads of glass -- new, not recycled -- to paint makers. ''It's not 'if,' but 'when,' this catches on,'' Mr. Burnett said.</p>
        <p>Among the skeptics is Mr. Eggley of Ford, who doesn't consider glass-bead or glass-chip paints to be distinctive. ''You can reproduce the same effects by adjusting pigments,'' he said, although he conceded that glass beads did make it easier to match colors when making repairs.</p>
        <p>''I've spent two years and a lot of resources trying to put glass in everything,'' he said. ''We can't duplicate what we see in show cars'' which are ''tricked out'' under carefully controlled conditions that cannot be duplicated in mass production. ''A pinch of ChromaFlair or Xirallic -- now that makes a difference,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 9, 2000, Monday  An article in the Automobiles section on Sept. 29 about new paint technologies misstated the number of special Ford Mustang Cobras painted with Flex Products' ChromaFlair, a color-shifting paint, and their hues. It was 2,000, not 1,200 cars, and the color changed from dark green to dark purple, not from deep blue to purple-black. The article also misstated the period in which Nissan used ChromaFlair on two cars in Europe. It was 1998 and 1999, not this year.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated Flex Products' investment in new pigment plants, and the number of new plants in Asia. It is more than $45 million, not $15 million, and the company is building one Asian plant, not two.</p>
        <p>The article referred incorrectly to the pigment used on numerals of the $20 bill. It is an ink used only in the printing of securities; it is not ChromaFlair.</p>
