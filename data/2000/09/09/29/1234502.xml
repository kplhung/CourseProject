        <p>Vancouver, British Columbia, is nearly 3,000 miles northwest of New York City. A sampling of attractions, along with travel information, with prices in United States dollars ($1 equals $1.49 Canadian):</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>FOUR SEASONS, 791 West Georgia Street, (604) 689-9333. Canada is justly proud of this Toronto-based chain, and Vancouver has no more prestigious address. Guests can avail themselves of an indoor/outdoor pool and a 165-shop mall that leads off the swanky lobby (with Birger Christensen and Prada as bait for the unwary). From the upper floors sweeping vistas open across the harbor to the mountains. But guest rooms are a bit dowdy, and service is disjointed. Double rooms: $302.58 to $383.27.</p>

        <p>Vancouver, British Columbia, is nearly 3,000 miles northwest of New York City. A sampling of attractions, along with travel information, with prices in United States dollars ($1 equals $1.49 Canadian):</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>FOUR SEASONS, 791 West Georgia Street, (604) 689-9333. Canada is justly proud of this Toronto-based chain, and Vancouver has no more prestigious address. Guests can avail themselves of an indoor/outdoor pool and a 165-shop mall that leads off the swanky lobby (with Birger Christensen and Prada as bait for the unwary). From the upper floors sweeping vistas open across the harbor to the mountains. But guest rooms are a bit dowdy, and service is disjointed. Double rooms: $302.58 to $383.27.</p>
        <p>METROPOLITAN, 645 Howe Street, (604) 687-1122. Built as a Mandarin hotel, the Metropolitan retains that group's understated elegance, and in Diva, it has one of the city's best dining rooms. Blond wood, ribbed silk and chrysanthemum prints evoke Asian tradition; business-class rooms with Frette robes, ergonomic chairs and computer printers plant the Met firmly in the 21st century. This is the kind of hotel where the staff knows your name before you check in. Double rooms: $218.50 to $285.80</p>
        <p>PAN PACIFIC, 300-999 Canada Place Way, (604) 662-8111. Part of Canada Place, where the big cruise ships dock, the 504-room Pan Pacific juts into the harbor beside the five white sails that have become the city's architectural trademark. Glass walls in the three-story lobby take full advantage of the site; guest rooms, trimly furnished in bird's-eye maple, offer hypnotic views. Squash courts and a running track; expensive and worth every penny. Double rooms: $310 to $365.</p>
        <p>SUTTON PLACE, 845 Burrard Street, (604) 682-5511. The choice of many a sophisticated traveler, this was once the property of the French-owned Meridien chain, and it still feels more European than North American. Guests are greeted by antiques, marble floors, lavish floral displays and a friendly front-desk team, and the 397 rooms show a similar attention to detail. An adjacent, connected building offers condominiums for rent by the week. Double rooms, $180.90 to $288.50.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>BISHOP'S, 2183 West Fourth Avenue, (604) 738-2025. John Bishop turns no somersaults and chases no fads. His food is simple and straightforward, marked by clear flavors, bright colors and combinations that work -- grilled salmon with a ginger glaze; seared scallops in a red pepper and chive bisque, topped with a potato galette; halibut on a warm potato salad.  The service is suave, personal, polished. This is a restaurant that will thrive for years.</p>
        <p>C, 2-1600 Howe Street, (604) 681-1164. The C stands for contemporary and for sea, which nicely sums up this glass-and-steel pavilion hard by False Creek, just across from Granville Island. In winter it's best at night; in summer go at midday, sit on the terrace and watch the world go by, in kayaks, on in-line skates and on bicycles built for two. The blue-plate lunch, for a mere $11 a head, includes a refined tomato bouillon, five plates of light, delectable seafood dim sum, and a few sweet tidbits. Top wines from everywhere.</p>
        <p>LE CROCODILE, 100-909 Burrard Street, (604) 669-4298. Michel Jacob named his restaurant for the three-star classic in his hometown, Strasbourg, and there are always Alsatian dishes on the menu, like onion tart and pheasant on sauerkraut. They are impeccably cooked, like everything else here, including liver with onions, and sweetbreads with Calvados. This is a place to savor the fondly remembered flavors of yesteryear; Proust would have adored it.</p>
        <p>KIRIN MANDARIN, 1166 Alberini Street, (604) 682-8833. Vancouver's best northern Chinese food, served by uncommonly gracious waiters in a bright, postmodern room. Suggestions: among the dim sum, the deep-fried prawn and yellow chive roll; among the big dishes, half a Peking duck, served in two courses: the sensationally crisp skin with scallions, pancakes and a very light hoisin sauce, followed by the duck meat steamed with cabbage and mushrooms.</p>
        <p>LUMIERE, 2551 West Broadway, (604) 739-8185. Rob Feenie is Vancouver's culinary phenom, and his welcoming restaurant has been chosen as the city's best for two years running. A typical summer dish: tiny slices of lightly seared salmon, served cold atop a granita made of celery juice, ponzu and shiso. Four tasting menus are offered nightly; I'd be happier if there were a la carte dishes, too.</p>
        <p>PHNOM PENH, 244 East Georgia Street, (604) 682-5777. A Chinatown hole in the wall with irresistible Cambodian and Vietnamese food, including crunchy, garlicky deep-fried spot prawns; cold chicken and cabbage salad and a sour fish soup with chilis, pineapple, purple basil and waterlily stems, deemed ''out of this world'' by Mrs. A. Five copious dishes, two beers, two Cokes: $45.</p>
        <p>PICCOLO MONDO, 850 Thurlow Street, (604) 688-1633. A small, serene realm of Old World courtesy, this is one of the city's hidden treasures. George Baugh and Michele Geris, husband and wife, soft-spoken and able, serve zephyr-light pastas and definitive, mahogany-dark osso buco. With which, praise the Lord, one can drink attractively priced 10-year-old red wines from the likes of Bruno Ceretto, Angelo Gaja and Monte Vertine. Just try that in New York.</p>
        <p>SUN SUI WAH, 3888 Main Street, (604) 872-8822. Marvelous dim sum and a lot more in a squeaky-clean room designed by Bing Thom, a leading Vancouver architect. The gentle flavors of the best Cantonese cooking prevail here, and the XO sauce, all the rage at the moment, is as good as any on the continent. Ask Allan Yung, the knowing manager, for guidance; but don't miss the tripe, squab and ham sui gok (deep-fried dumplings made from glutinous rice.)</p>
        <p>TOJO'S, 202-777 West Broadway, (604) 872-8050. Reserve a seat at the counter; watching Hidekazu Tojo work, seeking his counsel and laughing at his (bad) jokes is integral to the experience. The B.C. roll (''inside out'' salmon skin) is the trademark, but the seasonal specials are better. Sablefish in broth with sliced pine mushrooms, served in a bowl covered with parchment, thrilled us. So did halibut cheeks and citrus-cured albacore.</p>
        <p>VIJ'S, 1480 West 11th Avenue, (604) 736-6664. On the menu at Vikram Vij's animated, clean-lined restaurant, tucked behind a shiny black Art Deco facade just off Broadway, it says ''curry art.'' At the peak of their season, he chooses perfectly ripe mangoes and combines them with acidic tomatoes in a Gujarati sauce spiked with cumin. Slimline lamb chops (''popsicles'' in Vij-speak) are bathed in a red curry rich in fenugreek. Even the rice (basmati) is noteworthy, as is Mr. Vij's attention to his clients. No reservations.</p>
