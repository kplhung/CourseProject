        <p>John Ciardullo is planning to build himself a new home on Rock Shelter Road in the northern Westchester hamlet of Waccabuc, and why not?  He carved the road itself out of rocky wooded terrain, designed, engineered and built all the 7 houses on it, and will do the 14 yet to come.</p>
        <p>''I'm creating a community,'' he said during a recent visit, ''so why not live in it?''</p>
        <p>The community, set amid the rolling countryside, horse trails and estates of Waccabuc, an affluent hamlet in the town of Lewisboro, might have never been built had it not been for the tenacity of Mr. Ciardullo, whose projects in the New York City area have included public schools and parks, luxury high-rise apartments, low-income housing in the South Bronx and a refurbishing of the Algonquin Hotel. The story of his development and his singlemindedness shows the difficulties that developers can face in some areas even with comparatively small projects.</p>
        <p>In 1985, Mr. Ciardullo bought a 100-acre parcel of land for $900,000 and an adjoining 7-acre lot for $120,000, and then spent the next 11 years filing, revising and refiling plans to prove that he would meet the requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act and other state and local regulations.</p>
        <p>Among the agencies with jurisdiction over his project were the Lewisboro Planning and Town Boards; the Westchester County Health Department; the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, because the property is part of the city's watershed; and the State Department of Environmental Conservation. The process was complicated because his acreage contained wetlands.</p>
        <p>''I had to submit documents on the effect of the development on the topography, on the vegetation, on the wetlands, on endangered wildlife,'' Mr. Ciardullo said. ''We had to do an archaeological study to see if anyone had ever lived there before, and we found a cave on the property that dates back 4,000 years -- which gave us the idea for the name of the street. I also had to put in a salamander crossing -- and salamanders aren't even endangered.''</p>
        <p>Though getting approval for a subdivision is usually a lengthy procedure, ''the amount of time it took is extraordinary,'' said Adam Wekstein, a land-use lawyer who represented Mr. Ciardullo during the last three years of the process.</p>
        <p>Once the hurdles were cleared, and Mr. Ciardullo had sunk $5 million more into the venture, he began to put in the road and build a model house.</p>
        <p>Though he intended to offer only custom homes tailored to the individual preferences of the buyers, he has built several houses on speculation as models and then sold them. ''People have no imagination,'' Mr. Ciardullo said, ''no ability to visualize what it will look like unless they can see something.''</p>
        <p>The first spec house was sold two years ago for $250,000 less than it had cost him to put up, he said. ''We gave it away for $1.3 million because though people were interested, no one wanted to be the pioneer in a new subdivision,'' he said. ''People didn't know if we would survive. And no one knew the economy was about to boom.''</p>
        <p>Today, with six more houses completed and sold, two under construction and three on the drawing board, he is not giving anything away. Prices, which are agreed upon before any job begins, have risen with each house, to $2.4 million in the latest agreement.</p>
        <p>''The buyers, generally people in their 20's and 30's, have been mostly  people in the financial industries,'' he said. ''Doctors can't afford these houses anymore.''</p>
        <p>Three of the buyers have been content to buy spec houses rather than ones in which they had any input.</p>
        <p>''My husband wanted a new house, I wanted something older and this made us both happy,'' said Amanda Brown, who now lives in one of the houses that was built on speculation. ''And,'' she added, ''it had so many things we wanted we didn't feel the need to personalize.''</p>
        <p>Though he considers himself a modernist, Mr. Ciardullo has limited the Rock Shelter Road houses, replete with such details as Palladian windows, elaborate door casings and porticos, to classic Colonial style (albeit with the most current luxury appliances). ''Modern houses don't sell today,'' he said. ''Everyone wants Colonial so we give them an exact replica with all the modern accouterments.''</p>
        <p>Rambling in size from 6,700 to 7,400 square feet, they all combine formality (in living and dining rooms) with informality (large kitchens that flow into family rooms) and include vaulted ceilings, colonnades, expensive tile work and thick moldings. One of the spec houses had closets that were so large that the buyers turned two of them into children's bedrooms.</p>
        <p>Set on four-acre lots, the houses are built into terrain that is sloping, densely wooded and clearly a construction challenge. ''I like to figure out how to enhance land, not destroy it,'' Mr. Ciardullo said. He has put in stone walls along all the road and in other places within the property and incorporated the numerous outcroppings into the landscaping. For one of the houses under construction, he said, he had to blast 3,700 cubic yards of rock.</p>
        <p>Because he is a one-man band, doing everything from laying out septic systems to helping clients decide on the depth of their Jacuzzis, Mr. Ciardullo gets to know his clients well. And when the job is done, he said, ''you get me as a friend for all time.''</p>
