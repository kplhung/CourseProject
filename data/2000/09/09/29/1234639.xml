        <p>The Yankees will play the Florida Marlins at Yankee Stadium on Monday to make up the game that was rained out July 15. Or will they?</p>
        <p>Management and labor, not to mention the commissioner's office and the Yankees, disagree over the need for the game, leaving its status as uncertain as the series of races still being run in the final days of the season.</p>
        <p>Maybe someone will file a grievance and delay the start of the playoffs for a few days.</p>
        <p>Actually, delaying the start might not be a bad idea because it would give teams a little time to get everything straight. With three days left in the season, not one of the four postseason pairings has been set. In the National League, teams are still playing for home-field advantage. In the American League, teams are playing not only for home-field advantage, but also for the West Division title and the wild-card spot.</p>
        <p>The scheduling scenario is so fluid that the Yankees and the Mets could wind up playing first-round games on the West Coast at the same time, then play games in New York on the same day, a week from tomorrow. That part of the possible scenario is a result of the Yankees' recent rash of losses. They were cruising toward the home-field advantage, meaning games at Yankee Stadium next Tuesday and Wednesday, until they began losing.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' makeup game, scheduled for a noon start, was announced by the commissioner's office yesterday, as was another makeup involving a playoff contender. That game would have Oakland playing at Tampa Bay at 6:05 p.m. The games will be played, the commissioner's office said, because teams are so closely grouped in the quest for the West Division championship, the wild card and home-field advantage.</p>
        <p>But the players association, citing the tie-breaking guidelines in the collective-bargaining agreement, said the games should not be played unless they have a bearing on which teams make the playoffs. Union officials initially were unaware that the makeup games had been scheduled.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing of the development, Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said: ''A lot of people better keep their fingers crossed over the next few days that these matters become academic because there is a serious question about the propriety for playing these games.</p>
        <p>''My position has always been that we play games to determine who plays in the playoffs. We do not play games to determine where they play. I believe all of our agreements and documents that underlie our agreements point in that direction.''</p>
        <p>Joe Torre wasn't thrilled either.</p>
        <p>''I never thought this was going to happen,'' the Yankees' manager said in Florida before last night's game with Tampa Bay. ''I didn't think it was the right thing to do. But as of right now, nobody from the commissioner's office has called for my position on the matter.''</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, Torre said, ''I'm just going to make sure I'm at the back of the line of whatever bus or plane we're getting on.''</p>
        <p>Presumably, if the games remain on the schedule despite the union's position, but the unfinished races are resolved by the end of the games Sunday, the makeup games would be canceled. But no one of authority was in the commissioner's office late yesterday afternoon to comment on that possibility. All of the important people were in Milwaukee for the final game at County Stadium, home of the team the commissioner used to operate.</p>
        <p>Orza left open the possibility that the union would drop its objection to the games.</p>
        <p>''I'm not ruling out the possibility that we'll say under present circumstances we'll do this,'' he said, ''but it's an issue and should not be treated as a foregone conclusion. We'll have to discuss this, but in the meantime everyone involved in the discussions should do some good finger crossing the next few days.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees could have avoided the whole matter by winning a few more games. Two weeks ago, they had a five and a half game lead over Seattle and a seven and a half game advantage over Oakland in the quest for the home-field advantage. After last night's 11-3 loss to the Devil Rays, the Yankees were one and a half games behind Seattle and one game behind Oakland. Twelve losses in 15 games can make that sort of difference.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, of course, would like to be the home team in Games 1, 2 and 5 of the division series. They can recall that the only two times in the 90's when they were eliminated from the playoffs short of the World Series occurred in the fifth game in the other team's park -- 1995 in Seattle and 1997 in Cleveland.</p>
        <p>But Torre indicated his team would not necessarily go all out to gain the extra game at home if it has to play Monday. He doesn't plan, for example, to alter his playoff pitching plans for that game, most likely using Denny Neagle, who would be scheduled to pitch anyway.</p>
        <p>Should the Yankee game Monday create a tie, say, with the Mariners for home-field advantage, the teams would not play a game Tuesday to break the tie. The Mariners would gain the edge because they won the season series with the Yankees, six games to four.</p>
