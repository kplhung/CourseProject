        <p>Canada's largest bank, Royal Bank of Canada, has agreed to buy the Dain Rauscher Corporation of Minneapolis, a retail brokerage firm and investment banker, for $1.456 billion. At $95 a share, the offer is 19 percent above Dain Rauscher's trading price Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The chairman of Royal Bank, John Cleghorn, said the acquisition would provide ''an established U.S. presence and a platform for growth.'' In June, the bank bought the insurance businesses of the Liberty Corporation of Greenville, S.C., and indicated that it wanted to develop cross-marketing of banking, insurance and brokerage services that are not yet permitted in Canada. The latest transaction requires approval from regulatory agencies and shareholders.</p>
