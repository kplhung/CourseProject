        <p>A dozen current and former workers at one of Chinatown's largest restaurants have taken the novel step of suing its management under a federal anti-racketeering law for what they call extortionate practices that they say deprived employees of their pay and sought to break their union.</p>
        <p>The civil suit was filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan by 318 Restaurant Workers Union, which has been trying for years to organize workers at the New Silver Palace Restaurant, a 900-seat dim sum parlor on the Bowery near Canal Street.</p>

        <p>A dozen current and former workers at one of Chinatown's largest restaurants have taken the novel step of suing its management under a federal anti-racketeering law for what they call extortionate practices that they say deprived employees of their pay and sought to break their union.</p>
        <p>The civil suit was filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan by 318 Restaurant Workers Union, which has been trying for years to organize workers at the New Silver Palace Restaurant, a 900-seat dim sum parlor on the Bowery near Canal Street.</p>
        <p>The suit accuses the restaurant's management of devising ''a complex plan through which they carried out their extortion and labor law violations.''</p>
        <p>Because of the conspiracy nature of the harassment, the lawsuit said, the management is liable under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law targeting organized crime that can also be used in civil suits against corporations that commit specified illegal acts.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the suit marked the first time that the act has been invoked in a lawsuit brought by a union against an employer.</p>
        <p>''We hope this will tell the employer, 'Look, stop the harassment,' '' said Kwong Hui, president of the union. ''You can't extort money from your workers.''</p>
        <p>Jonathan Chiu, an owner of the restaurant, denied the charges.  ''This isn't organized crime,'' he said as he swept a hand across the bustling dining room at lunchtime yesterday. ''Do you see organized crime around here?''</p>
        <p>Several of the plaintiffs are members of the union, while the others are union supporters.</p>
        <p>In the suit, they accuse the management of ''minimum-wage violations, unlawful expropriation of tips, failure to pay overtime as required by law'' and other labor law violations.</p>
        <p>In interviews, several of the plaintiffs said that managers had in recent years taken as much as 25 percent of the tips earned by waiters at the restaurant.</p>
        <p>Jian Feng, a waiter who had been at the restaurant since 1989, said the management often uses anti-union workers to collect everyone's tips, then divide them at the end of the night using a chart. The managers would end up with a share, he said.</p>
        <p>The restaurant has also been accused of charging laid-off employees $5,000 each to get their jobs back.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chiu said many of his approximately 45 waiters, busboys and dim sum servers did not support Mr. Hui's union. They had instead formed a ''self-help'' group, he said, which is called the New Silver Palace Workers Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chiu also denied that the workers who collected the tip pool and divided it gave any of the money to management.</p>
        <p>''We have the best income, the best benefits at the New Silver Palace,'' he said. ''Everyone dreams of working here. The union also dreams of controlling us.''</p>
        <p>One reason the union used the federal anti-racketeering law in its suit is because violations of it entitle a plaintiff to treble damages for successful claims, such as for lost wages, said Kenneth Kimerling, a legal director at the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, which is representing the plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>For supporters of organized labor, the New Silver Palace has come to symbolize the plight of Chinese immigrants chained to backbreaking working conditions.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit is the latest volley in a five-year battle between organized labor and the restaurant. In 1997, the original Silver Palace, the first unionized restaurant in Chinatown, closed for four months.</p>
        <p>When it reopened under the ownership of Jonathan Chiu, many of the union workers were not rehired. That prompted the union to file a complaint in 1998 with the National Labor Relations Board.</p>
        <p>Last year, Howard Edelman, the National Labor Relations Board judge who heard the case, ruled that the restaurant had violated several labor regulations. That ruling is being appealed.</p>
        <p>Last year, the restaurant laid off several union supporters. The union went to court, and a federal judge in Manhattan ruled in January that the restaurant had to rehire those workers.</p>
        <p>''The labor department, the labor court, the labor judge all belong to the workers,'' Mr. Chiu said. ''So the employers always get charged.''</p>
