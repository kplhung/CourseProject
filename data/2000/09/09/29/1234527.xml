        <p>In sight of the famous waterside Opera House and the Olympic rings emblazoned across the Sydney Harbor Bridge, the United States crews of J. J. Isler and Pease Glaser, and Paul Foerster and Bob Merrick, raced to silver medals this afternoon in the waning days of the Olympic regatta.</p>
        <p>Competing in the men's and women's divisions of the double-handed 470 dinghy, the twin silvers represented the best results for the United States sailing team in two Olympiads. But if their performance was exhilarating for the Americans, the day was positively euphoric for the home team, which delivered the greatest day ever by an Australian Olympic sailing squad.</p>
        <p>With helicopters wheeling overhead, dozens of spectator boats cordoned off alongside the race course, and large crowds craning seaward from shoreline vantage points, the Australian duos of Tom King and Mark Turnbull, and Jenny Armstrong and Belinda Stowell, capped off strong, consistent regattas to capture the respective 470 gold medals. It had been 28 years since Australia's last sailing gold.</p>
        <p>Both United States pairs started the day off with golden possibilities, but their destinies were not entirely in their own hands. Isler and Glaser, in third place after 10 races, were 9 points behind the Australians. Theoretically, a race victory coupled with a poor finish by the Australians could propel them to first. But, in the points,  a bad race could have dropped the United States sailors from medal contention.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Foerster and Merrick began the day in second, 5 points behind the Australians. A race victory coupled with an Australian finish of sixth or worse would have earned the Americans the gold.</p>
        <p>The women's race went off first. The American boat got off to an inauspicious beginning. ''The breeze came in very quickly,'' Isler said, ''and we didn't get off the line very well.''</p>
        <p>Midway through the race, Isler and Glaser were mired in ninth place and sailing astern of the Australians, Israelis and Ukrainians, who were directly in their path to the medal podium. It appeared that the American pair was out of the running. But on the second-to-last downwind leg, Isler noticed a stream of wind pulsing off Bradley's Head, a promontory lined with spectators. Among them was her husband, Peter, like his wife a veteran of the America's Cup.</p>
        <p>''A couple of boats passed us by going really close to the headland and getting a big puff,'' Isler said. She made a mental note of exactly where.</p>
        <p>It paid off on the final leg.</p>
        <p>''On that last run, we saw the same kind of puff developing, so we kind of reached up for it,'' Isler said, ''and the next thing we knew we were crossing the Israelis.''</p>
        <p>Peter Isler, running along the coastline, noticed it, too. ''There was a sweet spot right at the point, and they also got a nice ride from a powerboat wake,'' he said.</p>
        <p>They were also passing several boats, and their sixth-place finish in the race -- the Aussies, to raucous cheers from the Manly Ferry, were first -- propelled the Americans to the silver medal.</p>
        <p>''I'm really happy,'' J. J. Isler said. ''Our best international finish coming into this regatta was a seventh. This is all we could ask for.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the women's team, the men's team, featuring Foerster, a silver medalist in 1992, and Merrick, came into the Olympics as one of the favorites. And on the final day, sailing a near-flawless race, they almost earned the top prize. ''We got a good start,'' Merrick said. ''We were able to go exactly where we wanted to go.''</p>
        <p>Like Isler and Glaser, the men realized that the point off Bradley's Head was paying huge dividends, and sailed directly for it. They rounded the top mark in first, with the Aussies a distant ninth.</p>
        <p>''We'd seen them earlier and knew they were a few back,'' Merrick said. ''But they're great sailors. From our point of view, they really needed to be about 15th at that point to not be able to come back.''</p>
        <p>But, the Australians did come back, rolling through the fleet to camp right behind the Americans. The United States team hung on to win the battle, but the Australians, with their second-place finish, won the war, and the gold.</p>
