        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR.'' Amato Opera's new season opened earlier this month, and, sadly, for the first time in nearly 50 years the fans of this family-run opera company were not greeted in the theater lobby by the co-founder Sally Amato, who died last month at 82. But the company, still run by Ms. Amato's husband, Anthony, goes on. Its first offering is a revival of its production of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' with performances tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon. Mr. Amato conducts. Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery; tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $25 ($20 for seniors and children under 12); (212) 228-8200 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>

        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR.'' Amato Opera's new season opened earlier this month, and, sadly, for the first time in nearly 50 years the fans of this family-run opera company were not greeted in the theater lobby by the co-founder Sally Amato, who died last month at 82. But the company, still run by Ms. Amato's husband, Anthony, goes on. Its first offering is a revival of its production of Donizetti's ''Lucia di Lammermoor,'' with performances tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon. Mr. Amato conducts. Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery; tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $25 ($20 for seniors and children under 12); (212) 228-8200 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''MADAMA BUTTERFLY,'' New York City Opera. Mark Lamos's production of Puccini's great work, introduced at the Glimmerglass Opera in 1997 and at the City Opera the next year, stands up well, offering a clean canvas for the compelling lighting design of Robert Wierzel. The performance mostly does justice to the production, with Andrew Richards a strong Pinkerton and Jake Gardner a worthy foil as Sharpless. The whole thing may be even better by now if Susan Bullock, effective in her middle range in the title role, has toned down the shrillness of her high notes on opening night and Jorge Mester, the conductor, has arrived at a considerate balance for the singers. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''LE NOZZE DI FIGARO.'' This John Copley production has been in the New York City Opera's repertory for about a quarter century, but it is attractive and compact, and does what a ''Figaro'' production should, which is foster the sense of ensemble and precision comic timing upon which the work depends. The company offers a youthful, well-balanced cast that includes Sari Gruber as Susanna, Dean Ely as Figaro, Paula Rasmussen as Cherubino, Pamela Armstrong as the Countess and John Hancock as the Count. Steuart Bedford conducts. Sunday at 1:30 p.m., the New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>''SAMSON ET DALILA.'' The Metropolitan Opera's 1998 production of Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila'' is back, and Placido Domingo, as Samson, is the main draw. Nearing 60, Mr. Domingo is singing better than opera buffs have any right to expect. He has to work harder vocally, but his voice still has its poignant timbre and clarion power. The mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves sang with some tentativeness on opening night, but the dusky richness of her voice was still essentially present, and she is surely one of the loveliest Dalila's ever. Elijah Moshinsky's production fills the stage with hanging scrims and sliding panels brush-stroked with reds, oranges and pinks, not to mention a troupe of scantily clad men and women for the Bacchanal scene. But the theatrics don't compensate for the stretches of tepid melodrama in Saint-Saens's second-rate score. Metropolitan Opera House, Friday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $180 to $250; also standing-room tickets at $12 and $16; (212) 362-0068 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''LA TRAVIATA,'' New York City Opera. Here is something increasingly rare at the City Opera: a work from the center of the repertory in a fully conventional production, this one of Verdi's opera by Renata Scotto. The sets, offering a certain Zeffirellian sumptuousness on a small scale, require singers with a strong stage presence, and Mary Dunleavy, in the title role, certainly fills the bill, with a lovely voice put at the service of an all-around dramatic intensity. Stephen Powell, as Giorgio Germont, stood up to her on opening night; Bruce Fowler, as Alfredo, fared less well in a colorless performance. Joseph Rescigno conducted loosely. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., New York State Theater, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $98 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''TURANDOT,'' Metropolitan Opera. If any opera can stand up to the excess Franco Zeffirelli has cultivated in his Met stagings, it is this one by Puccini, set in the Chinese court of legendary times. But strong vocal and dramatic presences are needed to register against the spectacular sets. The lead singers in this first performance of the season, Alessandra Marc (filling in for Sharon Sweet, who is ill) in the title role and Richard Margison as Calaf, bring vocal heft to bear, if not great subtlety; how the chemistry between them works dramatically remains to be seen. Marco Armiliato conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $180 and $250 and standing room tickets at $12 and $16 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>''WHAT PRICE CONFIDENCE?'' Ernst Krenek wrote ''What Price Confidence?,'' his bleakly satirical one-act opera, in 1945-46 for four singers from the Metropolitan Opera who wanted an unusual work that could be performed in a small theater with just piano. But the singers never learned it, and the opera was not performed until 1962 in Germany. Now Elysium, an organization that presents works that intersect between European and American cultures, is producing the New York premiere of this fascinating chamber opera in the Theater of the Riverside Church. The story concerns two couples in late Victorian England who test each other's confidence and wind up swapping partners in the process. The inventive 12-tone score is quite effective at conveying the subtleties of the drama. The able young cast and the fine pianist John W. Simmons serve the opera well in this appropriately simple staging. Theater of Riverside Church (enter at 91 Claremont Avenue and West 120th Street, Morningside Heights). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets $25 and $15; (212) 870-6784 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BACHWORKS. Not surprisingly, the provocative organist and conductor Anthony Newman is a vital presence in this Bach year, the 250th anniversary of the composer's death. Here, Mr. Newman, the artistic director of this chorus and orchestra, presents three of the composer's celebratory sacred cantatas: ''O Ewiges Feuer'' (No. 34), ''Nun Ist das Heil und die Kraft'' (No. 50) and ''Lobe den Herrn'' (No. 137). Tomorrow at 8 p.m., St. Paul's Chapel, Columbia University, Amsterdam Avenue at 116th Street, (212) 724-9315. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. It is a weekend for Classicism and early Romanticism at this floating concert hall. Tonight and Sunday, the violinist Mark Peskanov, the pianist Eduard Auer and the cellist Ronald Thomas offer Schubert's Piano Trio in E flat (Op. 100), Schumann's ''Fantasiestucke,'' for cello and piano, and Beethoven's Violin Sonata No. 8 in G. Tomorrow evening, Simon Wynberg, a guitarist who has made some interesting recordings on the Chandos label, is to join Mr. Peskanov, the violinist Jennifer Trahan, the violist Tania Susi and the cellist Inbal Segev, in the most famous of Boccherini's guitar quintets, the ''Fandango.'' He will perform a group of Schubert songs arranged for solo guitar, and a Paganini sonata for guitar and violin. The concert opens with Haydn's ''Rider'' String Quartet. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 and Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061 or 624-2083. Tickets: $27, $25 for the elderly, $15 for students (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>EROICA TRIO. This group of attractive young women -- Adela Pena, violinist; Erika Nickrenz, violist; and Sara Sant'Ambrogio, cellist -- has quickly established itself in the musical scene with a combination of cheesecake publicity and, by all accounts, excellent performances. Here they offer the famous Chaconne from Bach's D minor Violin Partita, arranged by Anne Dudley; Martinu's Piano Trio No. 1; and Dvorak's F minor Trio (Op. 65). Sunday at 2 p.m., Colden Center for the Performing Arts, Queens College, Kissena Boulevard at the Long Island Expressway, Flushing, (718) 793-8080. Tickets: $30, $28 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK GILBERT AND SULLIVAN PLAYERS. This inventive troupe -- the lone survivor of what was, not long ago, a thriving Gilbert and Sullivan tradition in New York -- usually presents its performances during the holiday season. This year it is starting early with a sampler, ''Glorious G &amp; S!'' -- an evening of patter songs and other highlights from some of the less ubiquitous Savoyard operettas, among them ''The Yeomen of the Guard,'' ''Patience'' and ''The Grand Duke.''  Sunday at 3 p.m., Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $31 to $46 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Kurt Masur produced one of his first seeming miracles with this orchestra weeks before he officially took over as music director in 1991, achieving a rare lightness and grace in a concert of Mendelssohn at Tilles Center on Long Island, which included the incidental music to ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Here, as part of a welcome three-week festival of Mendelssohn, Mr. Masur leads the orchestra and the American Boychoir in the same work and in choral pieces by the composer. Today at 11 a.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $17 to $66 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>BIRMINGHAM ROYAL BALLET. A lively and sometimes unconventional British company concludes its New York debut with ''Jazz Triple,'' a rousing program of one-act ballets to jazz scores choreographed by George Balanchine and David Bintley, the troupe's director. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 (Jack Anderson).</p>
        <p>CHERNIAK DANCE. ''Autumn Engravings,'' a suite of works by Susan Cherniak, includes dances to Mahler and to new music by Peter Hyde. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30 p.m.  Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, 11th floor, West Village, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $15 (Anderson).</p>
        <p>DANCE AS EVER. Peter Boal, a principal dancer of the New York City Ballet, appears as a guest artist in a new solo created for him by Leigh Witchel to George Butterworth's ''Shropshire Lad.'' Like the score, the choreography is inspired by A. E. Housman's poems about youth and transience. The program also includes group works by Mr. Witchel. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20; $12 for students and the elderly. Pace Downtown Theater, Spruce Street between Park Row and Gold Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 780-3413 (Anderson).</p>
        <p>AN EVENING OF BRAHMS. Five choreographers (Zvi Gotheiner, Ze'eva Cohen, Stefa Zawerucha, Doug Varone and Peggy Baker) celebrate the passion and tenderness of Brahms's chamber and vocal music in a program with live accompaniment by eight musicians. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30. Tickets: $15. St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, at Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 674-8194 (Anderson).</p>
        <p>JODI OBERFELDER. Six dancers perform heroic feats in acrobatic physical exchanges in ''Slay the Dragon,'' a full-evening piece, set to music by John Zorn, that addresses triumphing over adversity. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8. Tickets: $20; rush tickets, students and seniors, $15. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 226-2407 (Jennifer Dunning).</p>
        <p>REGGIE WILSON'S FIST AND HEEL PERFORMANCE GROUP. Reggie Wilson, a choreographer who marches to his own distinctive though quiet drumbeat, celebrates the new millennium and his own 33rd birthday with ''Wangena: The Birthday Concerts.'' Mr. Wilson blends an un-self-conscious postmodernist cool with a lovingly perceptive appropriation of folk materials. Tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets: $20; $14 for members, students and the elderly. Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 (Dunning).</p>
