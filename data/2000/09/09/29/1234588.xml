        <p>Vice President Al Gore said today that ''prosperity itself will be on the ballot'' on Nov. 7 and then repeatedly portrayed Gov. George W. Bush's proposed income tax cut as a serious threat to the country's economic health.</p>
        <p>''That's not tax relief,'' Mr. Gore said of his Republican rival's $1.3 trillion tax reduction plan. ''That's a massive tax on America's potential.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made his comments in a notably brief speech to a group of scholars and staff members at the Brookings Institution, one of Washington's most prominent research organizations. It is a nonpartisan group that conducts research on a broad range of domestic and foreign policy topics.</p>
        <p>The vice president made no new proposals during his address, which he read somewhat impassively from a teleprompter while standing at a lectern. But he did introduce new language, and aides said the speech, like other Gore addresses this week, was designed as something of a test drive for Mr. Gore's first debate with Mr. Bush, which is set for Tuesday night in Boston.</p>
        <p>If that is the case, viewers can expect to hear a vigorous assault on Mr. Bush's tax cut plan. Mr. Gore attacked the Bush plan five times in his 13-minute address. The candidates' disparate approaches to tax cuts provide perhaps the clearest distinction in this year's campaign, and Mr. Gore has long maintained that the Republican plan risks a return to heavy deficits.</p>
        <p>The Bush proposal would reduce all income tax rates, double the child credit, provide a break for married couples, repeal the federal estate tax and expand the deductibility of charitable contributions.</p>
        <p>It would reduce federal revenue by $1.3 trillion in the nine years starting 2002 and would use $1.6 trillion of the federal surplus because of increased interest costs that the government would incur if the surplus is used for tax cuts.</p>
        <p>The surplus is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to be $4.3 trillion during the same period.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, by contrast, opposes any across-the-board reduction in tax rates. He has proposed a $500 billion array of targeted tax cuts and credits aimed at providing relief for the middle class. They would include financial breaks intended to encourage retirement savings and to make college tuition, health insurance and child care more affordable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would spend more than Mr. Bush on education and health care, and he would devote significant sums to paying down the national debt.</p>
        <p>''Consider this fact,'' Mr. Gore said of Mr. Bush's proposal. ''The other side's plan gives more in tax cuts to the wealthiest 1 percent -- $667 billion of the surplus -- than all the new money they would invest in education, health care, prescription drugs and the national defense combined.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I believe in smart investments for the future, not massive tax cuts for the few that could bring us back into deficit.''</p>
