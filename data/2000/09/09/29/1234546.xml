        <p>For nearly every first-time Olympian, even one with lofty goals and an abundance of talent, tonight's achievement would have been more than enough. For Marion Jones, it was merely the end of Phase 2.</p>
        <p>After wringing the suspense out of the 200 meters with an ease and controlled class that made it clear she would win before she came charging out of the curve, Jones now has two gold medals and the first sprint double at the Olympics since Florence Griffith Joyner in 1988. Jones's time of 21.84 seconds was the best of the season and she won by a stunning 13 feet, but instead of the wide-eyed, fist-pumping paroxysms of joy which normally would accompany such a feat, there was only a glimmer of delight on her face and a somewhat subdued victory lap.</p>
        <p>The remarkable Jones is far from finished here, and she is intent on not losing her focus; not in the face of doping allegations against her husband C. J. Hunter in the middle of what were scripted to be her Games; not in the face of two gold medals when there are three more to be won.</p>
        <p>''It's not even halfway over,'' Jones said tonight, as she made her way cordially and professionally past a long line of television crews. ''As you all know, I'm here for greater things than two gold medals. I came to prove to myself it's possible to walk away from Sydney with five gold medals. So in a certain way I'm checking them off the list, but I'm still enjoying them.''</p>
        <p>She could have been excused for gloating. Her victory margin of 43-hundreths of a second over the silver medalist, Pauline Davis-Thompson of the Bahamas, was the largest in an Olympic 200 since 1960 when another African-American, Wilma Rudolph, dashed to gold in Rome. Not even Griffith Joyner, in her season of dominance in 1988, won by as much in Seoul.</p>
        <p>Jones later made it clear that it had been more of a struggle than it might have appeared, that she was not in a class by herself. But she said that while sitting next to Davis-Thompson and the bronze medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka. After Jones left, Davis-Thompson set the record straight.</p>
        <p>''I think Marion definitely is in a class by herself,'' Davis-Thompson said. ''She's a very talented athlete and you can take nothing away from her. She knows how to compete under pressure, and that's very tough.''</p>
        <p>Hunter, the reigning world shot-put champion, was watching from the stands tonight after it was revealed on Monday that he had tested positive in July for the steroid nandrolone. ''Just because something like this comes up doesn't mean he's going to hide in his apartment,'' Jones said, after embracing her husband during her victory lap. ''That's ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>Asked if she feared her husband's positive test might give the public the impression that she was not clean, Jones responded coolly, ''I don't have that fear, because the people that know me and support me and train me and coach me know I'm a clean athlete. So I don't think that at all.''</p>
        <p>Nor does Jones think that the revelations and resulting news media frenzy will have an impact on her performance here as she goes after gold medals in the long jump on Friday night and the 4x100 and 4x400 relays on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''None of us just started training this year, and this has been a dream of mine for a lot of years,'' she said. ''To let one event in your life, as dramatic as it might be, ruin it, that wouldn't be worth it at all.''</p>
        <p>While Jones surprised no one by winning the women's 200, Konstantinos Kenteris of Greece surprised everyone but himself by winning the men's 200. Entering the Olympics, Kenteris's personal best was 20.25 seconds -- not even good enough to put him in the top 20 in the world. But tonight, in a close and relatively slow race, he got the better of the favorite Ato Boldon down the stretch to win in 20.09. The silver went to Darren Campbell of Britain in 20.14; the bronze to a leg-weary Boldon in 20.20, 47-hundredths slower than his personal best.</p>
        <p>''That's what the Olympics are about;  the guy nobody counts on having the race of his life,'' said Boldon, who won a silver medal in the 100 on Saturday. ''He did, and I'm happy for him.''</p>
        <p>Not nearly as happy as Kenteris's fellow Greeks were for him. With the Olympics coming their way in four years, they have their first men's gold medal in a running event since Spiridon Louis won the marathon in the first modern Olympics in 1896 in Athens.</p>
        <p>Kenteris, 27, will now have a busy social calendar between now and 2004. Though he was unknown to track mavens, he was not unknown to Boldon, who beat him in the world junior championships in 1992. Since then, Boldon has gone on to fame and the beginnings of a fortune, while Kenteris has struggled with a chronic groin injury and paid the bills by becoming a physical education teacher. Kenteris began to hit his stride when he switched from the 400 to the 200 this season and joined a team of sprinters that includes the women's 100-meter silver medalist Ekaterini Thanou.</p>
        <p>Other winners tonight included Ivan Pedroso of Cuba in the long jump; Erki Nool of Estonia in the decathlon, and Yanina Korolchik of Belarus in the women's shot- put. Pedroso did not secure victory until the last of his six attempts, jumping 28 feet  3/4 inch to leap past Australia's flamboyant Jai Taurima, who already had jumped 27-10 1/4 with a lot of vocal support from the 110,000 fans in the stands. Roman Schurenko (27-3 1/4) of Ukraine won the bronze. For the first time in Olympic history, no American man won a medal in the long jump (excluding the 1980 Games which the Americans boycotted).</p>
        <p>While Nool, the first Estonian to win a gold, was below par in the pole vault and the javelin, he still managed to outscore the opposition with 8,641 points. That was more than 300 points lower than the world record held by the Czech decathlete and defending world champion Tomas Dvorak, who finished sixth while suffering from a torn stomach muscle. Dvorak's countryman Roman Sebrle won the silver with 8,606 points; Chris Huffins of the United States the bronze with 8,595 points.</p>
        <p>Huffins led after nine events, but after a relatively poor javelin throw left him with only a 14-point edge over Nool, Huffins knew that his chances of holding onto any medal were slim if he did not record a personal best in the 1,500. He would do that and more, slicing 12.49 seconds off his previous best to hold onto third place, 28 points ahead of Britain's Dean Macey.</p>
        <p>''I don't think any of us had an idea how fast I could run,'' said the 30-year-old Huffins, ''I think I earned a lot of people's respect today, including my own.''</p>
        <p>The American middle-distance runner Marla Runyan has earned respect with her success on the track despite a visual impairment that has left her legally blind. Tonight, she qualified for the 1,500-meter final by finishing sixth in her semifinal in a time of 4 minutes 6.14 seconds.</p>
        <p>''I started to feel the pressure, and then I thought about it and turned it around,'' she said. ''It's not pressure. It's an opportunity. I have the opportunity to show the world and kids that are losing their vision what life is going to be like. 'Now there's a girl who's legally blind, and she's in the Olympic final.' I hope parents out there will say, I'm going to let my child be whatever she wants to be.''</p>
        <p>As for Jones, the questions are whether she can overcome her technical shortcomings to beat Heike Drechsler of Germany, Fiona May of Italy and others in the long jump and whether her teammates can give her enough help in the relays. Without Jones in the lineup, the Bahamas won the 4x100 at last year's world championships. Davis-Thompson, a vivacious and voluble 34-year-old, was on that team.</p>
        <p>''We are still the underdog,'' she told Jones tonight, ''and we love being in that spot. It's just going to make our victory a little bit sweeter.''</p>
