        <p>A third of American women who had lumpectomies or other breast-conserving operations for early-stage breast cancer from 1990 to 1995 did not receive other needed treatments, a new study says.</p>
        <p>The study found that the women did not have radiation or lymph-node biopsies, both called for by standard treatment guidelines. Such incomplete treatment can double a patient's risk that the cancer will come back, and it is of particular concern because more women are having lumpectomy instead of mastectomy, said Dr. Ann Butler Nattinger, a professor of medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and lead author of the study, which is being published today in The Lancet.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nattinger's study, based on the records of nearly 145,000 women treated from 1983 to 1995, did not explain why the recommended procedures were sometimes skipped. Dr. Nattinger said she could only guess the reasons, and suggested that some doctors might not know the treatment guidelines, or might disagree with them.</p>
        <p>''The concern is that there is a real possibility of undertreating at least some of these women,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The current recommendations for treating early-stage breast cancer, issued by the National Institutes of Health in 1990, call for either mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery like lumpectomy. But neither procedure alone is sufficient. Both are supposed to include lymph-node biopsies, to see if the cancer has spread and if the patient needs chemotherapy. Women who have mastectomy usually do not need radiation, but lumpectomy, even for tiny tumors, is supposed to be followed by radiation.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nattinger said the best protection for patients was to learn as much as possible about breast cancer, seek second opinions and see  specialists in radiation and chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nattinger and her colleagues based their conclusions on medical records of 144,759 women 30 and older from around the United States who were treated for early breast cancer from 1983 to 1995. The data were taken from a registry of cancer patients created by the National Cancer Institute, and showed diagnoses and treatments.</p>
        <p>In 1983, only about 15 percent of patients had breast-conserving surgery, while the rest had mastectomy. By 1995, 50 percent had breast-conserving procedures. The proportion who also had radiation and lymph-node biopsy increased over time, but by 1995, 35 percent still lacked one or both of the additional procedures.</p>
        <p>But researchers at the National Cancer Institute, which provided the raw data for the study, questioned the findings and said their own analysis, not yet published, indicated that far fewer women were missing out on needed treatments and that the percentage receiving them was increasing.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rachel Ballard-Barbash, associate director of applied research in the division of cancer control and population science at the cancer institute, said, ''There have been substantial improvements in appropriate therapy, but there is still room for further improvement.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Ballard-Barbash said she thought 35 percent might be too high because women in the study were counted as having received radiation only if they got it within three months of their surgery. But some may have received it later, she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nattinger and other researchers said that it was not realistic to expect 100 percent adherence to any medical guidelines, and that in some cases there might be legitimate reasons to chart a different course. They said that for very elderly patients, especially those with other illnesses, the odds of living long enough to worry about a recurrence of breast cancer might not be high enough to justify the pain and inconvenience of radiation and lymph-node biopsies.</p>
        <p>Dr. Patrick Borgen, a breast cancer surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who was not involved in the research, said the study was ''such an important national snapshot.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Borgen said the study confirmed his observations. He said he saw women ''every week, all the time,'' who had received incorrect therapy at other hospitals.</p>
        <p>''The tragedy,'' he said, ''is when they come in because they have a recurrence, and you find out they had no radiation, no lymph-node dissection and therefore they didn't get chemotherapy.''</p>
