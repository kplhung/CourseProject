        <p>Apple Computer said today that its fourth-quarter earnings would fall far below analysts' estimates because of weak September sales, an announcement that sent the company's shares plunging in after-hours trading.</p>
        <p>''We've clearly hit a speed bump,'' said Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, adding that before investment gains, Apple would earn about $110 million rather than the expected $165 million for the quarter, which ends Sept. 30.</p>

        <p>Apple Computer said today that its fourth-quarter earnings would fall far below analysts' estimates because of weak September sales, an announcement that sent the company's shares plunging in after-hours trading.</p>
        <p>''We've clearly hit a speed bump,'' said Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, adding that before investment gains, Apple would earn about $110 million rather than the expected $165 million for the quarter, which ends Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>''Though this slowdown is disappointing,'' Mr. Jobs said, ''we have so many wonderful new products and programs in the pipeline, including Mac OS X early next year, and remain positive about our future.''</p>
        <p>Apple says it now expects earnings of 30 to 33 cents a share in the fourth quarter, well below the consensus estimate of 45 cents, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company earnings. The company said it expected to report revenue of $1.85 billion to $1.90 billion.</p>
        <p>Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., made its announcement after the close of the market. Apple shares, which had closed at $53.50, up $4.56 on Nasdaq, dropped as low as $28.25 in after-hours trading. Apple's last profit warning came a year ago when the company's results lagged forecasts because of parts shortages.</p>
        <p>Although Apple's loyal user base has often buffered it from the seasonal swings of the broader personal computer industry, analysts said the company was not immune to the global slowdown affecting the business this quarter. Last week, the Intel Corporation sent jitters through the technology sector when it warned of a slow quarter, which it attributed primarily to a soft market in Europe. The Dell Computer Corporation said in August that second-quarter sales rose more slowly than expected because of weak demand.</p>
        <p>But analysts said the bigger fear for Apple was whether the shortfall indicated that the company's much-heralded turnaround -- tied to Mr. Jobs's return to the helm and the introduction of the popular iMac desktop computer -- had run out of gas. For Apple to continue growing at the pace it had been, it has to claim new computer users and former PC users for its Macintosh computers, something it has been doing. Now it is unclear whether the company can continue to make gains among those users, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time since Steve returned the company to profitability in the fourth quarter of '97 that they've truly hit a wall,'' said Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read. ''It's not that its so dramatic a wall, but it is, in my mind, an ominous one. The scary part is maybe their ability to attract new users to the Mac platform will be more difficult in the future.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, Fred D. Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer, attributed the expected shortfall to three factors. ''First, we experienced lower-than-expected September sales due to a business slowdown in all geographies,'' he said. ''Second, our education sales, which normally peak during September, were lower than expected. And third, our Power Mac G4 Cube is off to a slower-than-expected start, resulting in revenues below expectations.''</p>
        <p>Although the G4 Cube has won rave reviews for its sleek design, it appears to be selling primarily to Mac loyalists rather than winning over new users, analysts said. The slowdown in education sales, traditionally an Apple stronghold that accounts for about 25 percent of revenue, is particularly troubling, they said, because it could indicate the loss of market share.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Apple began shipping a public beta test version of Mac OS X, the new version of its operating system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said the company would provide lower growth targets for the next quarter and the next fiscal year when it announced final results on Oct. 18.</p>
