        <p>The Senate today passed a stopgap spending measure that will allow the federal government to function through Oct. 6, seven days after the end of its fiscal year.</p>
        <p>With the Senate's 96-to-0 vote to approve the short-term spending measure and the House approval of the legislation on Tuesday, Congress has now given itself more time to debate the remaining 11 spending measures that finance a variety of federal agencies, including the State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
        <p>Only two spending bills -- one a  $288 billion measure for the military and another, smaller, bill that provides funds for military construction -- have been approved by Congress and signed by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>During a lengthy debate in the Senate on the stopgap financing bill, known as a continuing resolution, Democrats criticized Republicans for failing to enact the 11 spending measures, comparing the Republican-controlled legislature with the ''do nothing'' Congress of 1948.</p>
        <p>''I'm afraid that we have now developed an operating procedure around here that is a disaster,'' said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota. ''We end up with no accountability and no control and chaos at the end. That's where we are today. This is chaos.''</p>
        <p>Much of the Democrats' ire has been directed toward Republican leaders who have held off presenting for Senate passage three major spending bills. One finances the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Housing and Urban Development; another provides money for the Commerce, Justice and State Departments; the third authorizes the budgets for the Treasury Department and other agencies.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have also expressed anger at a tactic the Republican leaders had used recently. The  latter had asked the Senate to vote on a House-Senate conference spending measure for military construction projects that included the full spending bill for the Treasury Department, even though the Senate had not debated or voted on the Treasury measure. The bill was defeated.</p>
        <p>''We are poisoning the institutional role of the United States Senate, rendering it weaker and weaker in influence and usefulness,'' said Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia.</p>
        <p>For their part, Republicans said they had to use unorthodox methods to get spending bills passed because Democrats had been stalling, attaching amendment after amendment to spending bills to delay passage.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, the process has broken down,'' said Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah. ''If I were to look for a place to place blame, I would look towards'' the Democratic leadership.</p>
        <p>Amid all the finger-pointing, some lawmakers acknowledge that one cause of the slow pace is the caution bred by a fear of making a political mistake at a time when the balance in the House and the Senate, as well as in the presidential race, rests on a razor's edge.</p>
        <p>''The stars are all aligned,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. ''You are going to elect a new president, and both houses are in play. That doesn't happen often.''</p>
        <p>Even as Congress gave itself breathing room to work out agreements between Republicans and Democrats and between Capitol Hill and the White House, the House moved toward a confrontation today with the administration about the water flows of the Missouri River.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 301 to 117, the House approved a compromise worked out in a House-Senate conference on a $23.6 billion spending measure that finances the Department of Energy, including the national laboratories where nuclear weapons are developed, and other federal water and energy programs. The Senate is scheduled to consider the measure next week.</p>
        <p>The energy and water bill, however, also contains an amendment that prevents the Army Corps of Engineers from revising its plan to manage the upper reaches of the Missouri River.</p>
        <p>For years, environmentalists have urged the corps to increase the springtime Missouri flows, thus providing a more hospitable habitat for threatened species like the pallid sturgeon and two endangered birds, the piping plover and the least tern.</p>
        <p>But the proposed change is opposed by downriver lawmakers in Missouri like the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, a Democrat, and Senator Christopher S. Bond, a Republican. They say that changing the water flows of the Missouri in the spring could mean reduced flows in the river in the late summer. As a result, Mr. Bond has argued, barge operators would have difficulty navigating the river.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists and other Democrats -- including the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle, an up-river lawmaker from South Dakota -- have persuaded the administration to veto the measure.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, wrote a letter declaring that unless the amendment barring the Corps of Engineers from revising its management of the Missouri was dropped or substantially modified, ''the president will veto this bill.''</p>
