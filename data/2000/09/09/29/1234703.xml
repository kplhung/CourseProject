        <p>The Official All Star Cafe, a five-year-old theme restaurant that helped to transform Times Square into a tourist destination, closed Tuesday night to make way for another theme restaurant owned by the same company.</p>
        <p>Planet Hollywood will move its flagship restaurant, on 57th Street near Seventh Avenue, to the newly vacant space at 45th Street and Broadway, company officials said.</p>
        <p>Planet Hollywood International, which owns both restaurants, has been closing unprofitable restaurants and franchising others since it filed for bankruptcy protection last October.</p>
        <p>Company officials said the new Planet Hollywood would open this year.</p>
