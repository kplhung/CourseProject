        <p>The federal Environmental Protection Agency has notified New York City officials that it believes changes made in the city's lead-paint law last year are critically flawed. It said the law is now likely to result in more lead poisoning of children and called on the city to close the loopholes.</p>
        <p>The agency acted after pleas from health experts and tenant groups who opposed the city's revisions as dangerous to children, who can suffer mental, physical and emotional impairment and sometimes even death from ingesting lead dust and paint chips.</p>
        <p>Under E.P.A. rules, work to remove lead paint completely in residences must be done by specially trained workers, and after its completion, a test must be conducted to ensure that no lead dust or other contamination remains.</p>
        <p>The city law, which deals with lead-control work other than full removal, does not require trained workers or follow-up tests. The federal agency's rules do not cover such work, although the agency is considering extending its regulations.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A.'s concerns were expressed in letters sent last week by Jeanne M. Fox, the agency's New York regional administrator, to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker; and several other officials.</p>
        <p>''While I applaud the law's intent and its clear movement in the right direction for protecting children, I believe that Local Law 38, as currently written, falls short of the protection that children deserve and need,'' Ms. Fox wrote. She said the city law omits the ''two critical additional steps'' of requiring qualified workers and follow-up tests.</p>
        <p>Without these steps, cleanup efforts would probably lead to greater lead hazards, a higher risk of lead poisoning in children and, in some cases, children with higher blood levels than before the cleanups, she said in the letter. ''But preventing this unintended consequence is clearly within the control of New York City.''</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration defended its policies but said it would confer with the federal agency. Mr. Vallone also praised the city's approach, but said he was open to making improvements.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fox said she planned to meet with city officials to urge that they adopt the changes. She said the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development had imposed similar rules for housing it subsidizes.</p>
        <p>Trained workers and contamination testing were among the major issues that split the usually unified Council, which last year passed the revision of the lead law 36 to 15. The changes updated the city's original 1982 lead law to reflect findings that efforts to contain lead were safer than attempts at complete removal.</p>
        <p>Critics accused Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Vallone of doing the bidding of campaign donors from the real estate industry, which opposed stricter rules as unnecessary and costly.</p>
        <p>''The E.P.A. is saying exactly what the experts told the City Council last year,'' said Matthew J. Chachere, a lawyer for the New York Coalition to End Lead Poisoning, which has been pressing for more city action to eradicate lead poisoning.</p>
        <p>Both the Giuliani administration and Mr. Vallone pointed out that reported cases of lead poisoning had declined for five years, with 896 last year. But Mr. Chachere said the latest law did not take effect until the end of 1999. Despite a state requirement that all children be tested, most are not. The blood test for lead measures recent exposure but does not detect lead elsewhere in the body.</p>
