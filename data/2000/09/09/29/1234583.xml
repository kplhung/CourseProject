        <p>The owner of The Boston Herald is purchasing the Community Newspaper Company, a group of four daily and 88 weekly newspapers in the Boston suburbs, from Fidelity Capital, the new business and venture capital arm of Fidelity Investments.</p>
        <p>The purchase price was not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The deal gives Patrick J. Purcell, the owner of Herald Media Inc., a regional platform from which to compete with The Boston Globe, particularly in the wealthy suburbs west of the city. The Globe is owned by The New York Times Company, which earlier this year completed its purchase of The Worcester Telegram &amp; Gazette, Massachusetts's third-largest newspaper, for $295 million.</p>
        <p>The Telegram &amp; Gazette circulates in many of the same western suburbs where Community Newspapers owns weeklies. The biggest of the four daily newspapers, The MetroWest Daily News, is published in Framingham.</p>
        <p>In a conference call yesterday, Mr. Purcell declared, ''Let the battle begin.''</p>
        <p>In the six and a half years since he bought The Herald -- which has a daily circulation of 266,000 -- from his old employer, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Mr. Purcell has impressed industry analysts and New England newspaper executives with his ability to keep The Herald profitable.</p>
        <p>The same observers say that Fidelity struggled to get consistent returns on its investment in the newspapers and niche publications that serve 140 communities in eastern Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>''In my view, Fidelity has not operated these newspapers well,'' said Steven Barlow, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>William B. Ketter, the former editor of The Patriot Ledger in Quincy, Mass., who is now chairman of Boston University's journalism department, said: ''I think Fidelity has found that the newspaper business is a very difficult business. They tried the concept of 100 little mice trying to be an elephant, and they realized that it didn't work.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Purcell, operating from a strong base in Boston, may be able to find economies and combinations that enhance The Herald's reach and profitability, while increasing the margins of the community newspapers, which have a combined circulation of about 900,000. ''I think the purchase of the Fidelity papers by The Herald moves them up a significant notch in competition with The Globe,'' Mr. Ketter added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Purcell said yesterday that ''this is an extraordinary revenue-generating opportunity.'' He added that ''the ability to generate ad revenue in this combination is enormous.'' He also noted that his was by far the biggest community newspaper operation in a single region.</p>
        <p>Two other companies have pursued a similar strategy. Pulitzer Inc., the owner of The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, paid $165 million in the summer for Suburban Journals of Greater St. Louis, including 38 newspapers and some niche publications. Hollinger Inc., the parent of Hollinger International, owns Chicago's No. 2 newspaper, The Chicago Sun-Times, as well as the suburban Pioneer Press newspapers.</p>
        <p>The announcement of the Community Newspaper sale came on the same day The Globe started its new Thursday GlobeWest section, serving 35 communities in Boston's western suburbs. The Globe has also just finished a redesign, and has recently added new editorial initiatives, including focused weekly business coverage of the biotechnology industry -- a growing part of the economy of the same western suburbs.</p>
