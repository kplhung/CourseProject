        <p>The North American debut of Sony's new Playstation 2 video system appears to have become a marketing nightmare.</p>
        <p>After days of rumors, Sony confirmed on Wednesday that it would fall far short of meeting its promise to have a million devices ready for sale on Oct. 26. At least 500,000 consumers Sony had expected to satisfy immediately -- many of whom had made deposits with retailers -- will be turned away. Sony blamed shortages of electronic components, though it offered no details.</p>
        <p>Analysts estimate that despite Sony's plans to ship 100,000 units a week from the end of October until Christmas, sales of the $299 device will fall at least 700,000 units below previous projections for the Christmas season, costing more than $200 million in revenue. And that is not counting lost sales from game software and compact discs that can be played on Playstation 2, the first device that lets users play video games, browse the Internet and play DVD-format discs on one machine.</p>
        <p>Rivals asserted that Sony was squandering a huge opportunity in the $8 billion games industry, where 60 percent of sales come in the last quarter of the year.</p>
        <p>''You have to have something under the Christmas tree, '' said Peter Moore, president and chief operating officer of Sega of America, which is shifting its $149 Dreamcast video units from container ships to air freighters to fill what it describes as soaring demand from retailers frantic to stock up on alternatives to Playstation. ''Rain checks won't work with kids.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts were not so sure. While some sales would be lost, they said, Playstation 2 is such an advance on competing systems that many serious game players, however annoyed, are likely to wait until Sony works out its production bottlenecks. While Sega will certainly experience a measurable lift, they say, Playstation 2 will not face true competition until the fall of 2001, when both Microsoft and Nintendo are expected to introduce products with comparable features.</p>
        <p>Sony said Wednesday that it would catch up with its previous production promises by the end of its fiscal year next March 31, its target date for having sold 10 million Playstation 2 consoles worldwide. The device was introduced in Japan last March.</p>
        <p>''They are just shifting revenue from the end of this year to the first three months of 2001,'' said James Lin, an analyst at Sutro &amp; Company. ''The impact is minimal once you do the math.''</p>
        <p>Sony's stock and shares of game designers like Electronic Arts and Activision rebounded in heavy trading yesterday from sharp declines on Wednesday, when rumors about Sony's problems had swirled through the markets.</p>
        <p>Sony's American depository receipts rose $5.06 yesterday, to $104.44, after falling $9.38 on Wednesday. Electronic Arts rose $4.94, to $50.13; Activision climbed $1.38, to $14; and THQ rose $3.44, to $24.50.</p>
        <p>Sony's problems represent the latest variation on a familiar theme this year for electronics consumers and investors. The entire industry has been hit by shortages of memory chips, displays, several types of processors and even humdrum components like capacitors -- tiny devices that cost a few cents but are crucial to managing power on chips.</p>
        <p>Some companies, including I.B.M.,  Palm and the cellular phone giant Ericsson, have lost so much production to shortages that it has had a material impact on earnings. Analysts expect fewer such announcements in the coming months as many of the shortages are eased, but several component markets are expected to remain tight for at least another six months.</p>
        <p>Sony's inability to pull together the components needed to create a huge inventory of Playstation 2 units for rollout contrasts with the situation at Sega, which ironed out the mass-production kinks that Dreamcast encountered last year and has been able to build a slight buffer of inventory this year.</p>
        <p>Sony's shortfall, though, is vast even by gaming industry standards, and many retailers are fuming that they were not warned sooner.</p>
        <p>The battle for short supplies is certain to be tense for months, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''The big question is how it is distributed among the big versus the small shops,'' said John-Paul McNealy, a consumer electronics analyst for the Gartner Group in San Jose, Calif. ''We think the mom-and-pop stores are going to get pinched.''</p>
