        <p>Since June 17, when Shane Mosley dethroned Oscar De La Hoya and seized the World Boxing Council welterweight title by a decision, Mosley has played some basketball, taken a Caribbean cruise and basked in the accolades. But he has not been in the ring.</p>

        <p>Since June 17, when Shane Mosley dethroned Oscar De La Hoya and seized the World Boxing Council welterweight title by a decision, Mosley has played some basketball, taken a Caribbean cruise and basked in the accolades. But he has not been in the ring.</p>
        <p>A bout Nov. 4 will mark his first title defense, but it will not be a rematch with De La Hoya. Instead, Mosley will fight the junior welterweight champion, Antonio Diaz, in the Theater at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>''I'm very anxious to get into the ring and fight,'' Mosley said yesterday on a conference call.</p>
        <p>His promoter, Cedric Kushner, tried to schedule the rematch, but De La Hoya has put his boxing career on hold. Kushner hopes to arrange a May 5 bout against De La Hoya and is negotiating a Feb. 24 fight against Arturo Gatti.</p>
        <p>The 28-year-old Mosley (35-0), of Ponoma, Calif., will earn $3 million for the Nov. 4 fight; Diaz (32-2), 24, from Michoacan, Mexico, will earn $360,000. Hector Camacho Jr. will fight Goyo Vargas on the undercard.</p>
