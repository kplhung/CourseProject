        <p>David Zwirner Gallery</p>
        <p>43 Greene Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>Through Oct. 7</p>
        <p>Presenting the work of two artists who have much in common yet are also poles apart, this pair of solo shows gives voters a real choice.</p>
        <p>In the front room are the impish drawings of Marcel Dzama, a Canadian artist having his second solo show in New York. On empty fields of white paper, Mr. Dzama's neatly rendered ink-and-watercolor drawings isolate encounters that are variously sexual, violent or just plain odd, among humans, animals and literary characters (Oz's Tin Woodman, for example), sometimes accompanied by bits of dialogue. The drawings are hung unframed, three deep in a door-to-door installation; they give the appearance of an extended but disjointed comic book for adults, and one tends to skim along, until a particular vignette reaches out and snares the eye.</p>
        <p>In the second gallery, the equally weird fantasy life of Jockum Nordstrom, a 37-year-old Swedish artist who has never exhibited in New York, is revealed in a series of 14 heavily worked pencil drawings, mostly interiors but with a few landscapes and one dazzling seascape. Each is a more or less truculent crazy quilt of images, styles and events. Past and present are one, and the subconscious is present in figures in the carpet, doodlings on the ceiling or unexpected presences -- Captain Hornblower, for example -- on the kitchen table.</p>
        <p>The drawings reflect attention to both traditional folk art and the art of the insane; a fascination with music and musicians, especially of the jazz variety; a familiarity with furniture and architectural design; and a discreet use of favorite photographs or family snapshots. They share common ground with early David Hockney, Tom Trosch's clogged interiors and the dense drawings of the German artist Erwin Pfrang. But Mr. Nordstrom's drawings have a hallucinatory power all their own, which emanates less from his imagery than from the extraordinary range of drawing techniques that bring it into being.</p>
