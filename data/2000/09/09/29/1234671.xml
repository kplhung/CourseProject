        <p>As tensions deepen for him at home, President Alberto K. Fujimori of Peru flew to Washington today to seek support from the United States and inter-American countries and organizations for his plan to transfer power to an elected successor, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's trip stunned Clinton administration officials, who last week were acutely worried that he might be ousted by military officers loyal to his fired intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos.</p>
        <p>Those fears eased somewhat after Mr. Montesinos took refuge in Panama. But American officials said that Mr. Fujimori's hold on power remained precarious and that Mr. Montesinos remained capable of influencing events in Peru.</p>
        <p>Ten Peruvian lawmakers have withdrawn their support from Mr. Fujimori, and an 11th has been expelled from his Peru 2000 coalition since the president announced on Sept. 16 that he would call elections.</p>
        <p>The lawmakers' departure has cost the autocratic Mr. Fujimori his majority in the Congress and confused a political climate that was for nearly a decade anchored by him  and his rarely photographed but ubiquitous spy chief, Mr. Montesinos.  The Congress did, however, accede to Mr. Fujimori's request to abolish the National Intelligence Service, which Mr. Montesinos led.</p>
        <p>In several areas of Peru, a transportation strike gained ground. The affected zones included the second-largest city, Arequipa. Dozens of Peruvians were arrested in protests in coastal cities as demonstrators called for an end to high fuel prices, lower unemployment and Mr. Fujimori's immediate departure.</p>
        <p>After a round of hurried calls to Washington late Wednesday, Mr. Fujimori arrived and met Cesar Gaviria, the secretary general of the Organization of American States. Since denouncing Mr. Fujimori's re-election in May as fraudulent, the 34-nation hemispheric forum has pressed him to hold a new vote.</p>
        <p>A senior administration official said Mr. Fujimori, after having spurned the O.A.S. for months, was now seeking its embrace to thwart political or military challenges at home as he arranged a transition. Mr. Fujimori's aides have indicated that he is considering holding elections in March, with the inauguration of a president in July.</p>
        <p>''He's coming to the O.A.S. to lift his standing and to show he's in control,'' the official said. ''It's very gutsy.''</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Fujimori's challengers is the democratic opposition, which includes Alejandro Toledo, the candidate for president who withdrew from the race in the spring as signs of electoral fraud developed.</p>
        <p>There is also a small but powerful group of army leaders who owe their careers to Mr. Montesinos.</p>
        <p>''Fujimori is trapped between the military, which wants Montesinos back or wants a coup, and the opposition which wants an immediate transition,'' said Eduardo Gamarra, an Andean expert at Florida International University.</p>
        <p>Last week, the army leaders sent menacing signals to bolster their demand that Mr. Montesinos be granted permanent haven in Panama. Panamanian authorities are considering his request for asylum, a status that would make it harder to prosecute him for political extortion, murder and other abuses attributed to him by human rights groups.</p>
        <p>American officials and Mr. Gaviria, a former president of Colombia, had pressed President Mireya Moscoso of Panama to admit Mr. Montesinos in the first place. The officials said it would be up to Peruvian and Pananamian officials to determine whether he should be prosecuted.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said Mr. Montesinos, who reportedly has vast files on Peruvians, including Mr. Fujimori, has long had an informal relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on Friday morning. American officials privately said he appeared determined to protect a mixed legacy. It has weakened democratic institutions, but it has also neutralized threats posed by guerrilla groups, fought the narcotics trade and opened up the Peruvian economy.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the State Department, Philip T. Reeker, said, ''We will, of course, when we do meet with President Fujimori, emphasize our support for a peaceful, democratic, constitutional transition of power for the continuation of that O.A.S. dialogue that has been going on and which we very much supported.''</p>
