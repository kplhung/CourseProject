        <p>Food That Travels Well</p>
        <p>Delicious, nutritious and portable, sandwiches are the perfect meal for people on the go. These dozen places offer great sandwiches. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Boerum Hill  Food Company</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(718) 222-0140</p>
        <p>134 Smith Street,</p>
        <p>near Bergen Street</p>
        <p>Brooklyn</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Boerum, a pleasant cafe with a small display of prepared foods, offers a small rotating menu of sandwiches, salads and dishes that travel well, like crepes with chicken sausage, spinach, roasted red onions and cheddar, and meaty chicken drumsticks painted with a fruity barbecue sauce. The turkey club sandwich made with turkey breast and thick slices of bacon, served on excellent challah with cranberry sauce, sweet-potato puree and mustard mayonnaise, is so good it may make people forget that turkey is only for holidays.</p>
        <p>2. Carnegie Deli</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 757-2245</p>
        <p>854 Seventh Avenue,</p>
        <p>at 55th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>You can't consider sandwiches in New York without paying proper respect to the pastrami sandwich, as emblematic of the city's culinary roots as the egg cream and the blintz. If not the very best, Carnegie's pastrami sandwiches are at the highest level. They are legendarily enormous, big enough to feed you and a friend and still provide lunch for tomorrow. Beyond pastrami, the cheese blintzes with sour cream are also wonderful and only slightly more modest.</p>
        <p>3. Cosi Sandwich Bar</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 949-7400</p>
        <p>38 East 45th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>With more than a dozen branches in Manhattan, Cosi is now a sandwich empire. Each store offers a sleek, stylish assembly line for building sandwiches to your specifications. As you line up at the sandwich counter, you can stare into the flame of a towering metal oven where Cosi's crisp Roman flatbread is baked. The bread, tasting of olive oil and salt and wonderful by itself, is the constant: you can choose one, two or three fillings, like tandoori chicken, buffalo chicken or cucumber and blue cheese spread. And now these sandwiches are available all over Midtown and the financial district.</p>
        <p>4. The Lobster Club</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 249-6500</p>
        <p>24 East 80th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Anne Rosenzweig's small, casual restaurant offers many dishes that are new and creative yet comforting. Matzo brei with wild mushrooms is light, focused and delicious. Crispy rock shrimp are a glorious appetizer, while Mom's meatloaf, roast chicken and roast suckling pig are all excellent versions of familiar favorites. Her lobster club sandwich, the restaurant's namesake, is terrific. The unusual wine list is arranged by price and includes an exceptional selection of hard-to-find bottles.</p>
        <p>5. Lobster Place</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 255-5872</p>
        <p>Chelsea Market</p>
        <p>75 Ninth Avenue,</p>
        <p>near 15th Street</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The block-long Chelsea Market, set in an old Nabisco factory near 15th Street between 9th and 10th Avenues, is the home of Lobster Place, a retail fish market filled with gleaming fresh seafood. In the rear of the shop you can find the wonderfully meaty lobster roll, full of plump, flavorful chunks of lobster on a hot-dog roll. It's a great sandwich and hard to resist snacking on as you wander the stores looking for a meal to take home.</p>
        <p>6. Peanut Butter And Company</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 677-3995</p>
        <p>240 Sullivan Street, near West Third Street</p>
        <p>Greenwich Village</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>A whole restaurant built around the peanut butter sandwich? Is it a joke? Apparently not, though some of the sandwiches are more funny than good. The Elvis, grilled peanut butter on white or wheat bread drizzled with honey and stuffed with sliced bananas, is as syrupy sweet as the king at his worst, and the peanut butter-Nutella combination is like eating a Reese's cup on bread. The spicy peanut butter sandwich with grilled chicken and pineapple jam is a step toward real food, still sweet but tasty nonetheless. Give Peanut Butter and Company credit for staying in character, right to packing your sandwich in a lunch bag and sticking in a wax paper baggie of carrot sticks. Eat them all and you can have dessert: four big and not-too-sweet peanut butter cookies.</p>
        <p>7. Pepe Rosso to Go</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 677-4555</p>
        <p>149 Sullivan Street, near Houston Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>At this small Italian takeout shop, the first in what has become a minichain, the aroma of freshly baked focaccia is a magnet for hungry passers-by. Mauro Servisi, the owner and chef, makes what is almost a perfect sandwich: bresaola, or air-cured beef, with goat cheese, arugula and truffle oil on circular focaccia. It is ideally proportioned, allowing you to get your mouth around the sandwich without squeezing the life out of it. Each element of flavor and texture -- the spiciness of the beef, the creaminess of the cheese, the bitter edge of the arugula, the pungency of the truffle oil, the oily bite of the focaccia -- joins to form a perfectly balanced coherent unit. It's almost enough to make you forget the fine pastas and other dishes that are also offered.</p>
        <p>8. Saigon Bahn Mi</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 941-1541</p>
        <p>88 East Broadway, Unit 108</p>
        <p>Chinatown</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>The Vietnamese are master sandwich makers, a legacy of their time under the French, when they were introduced to French bread and fine coffee among other things. You ordinarily won't find Vietnamese sandwiches, or banh mi, in restaurants, though. They are considered street food, great for a quick snack or lunch. Saigon Banh Mi is a tiny storefront at the 88 East Broadway Mall, practically under the Manhattan Bridge. If you can squeeze in, place your order and watch as the counterman slices open a crusty French roll and fills it with barbecued pork that has a deep, dark, intense flavor that comes from fermented fish sauce. He then adds thin slices of a pale seafood sausage and finishes with fresh cucumber, marinated carrots, cilantro and, if you wish, hot sauce. It is a great combination of savory and cool.</p>
        <p>9. Sandwiches</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 255-0930</p>
        <p>60 Greenwich Avenue, near Seventh Avenue South</p>
        <p>Greenwich Village</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>The brothers Marcos and P. J. Ramirez preside over this quirky takeout shop, and they are as likely to challenge you on how you wear your hair as they are to look at you. Order a chicken salad, and they'll advise you to get the meatloaf sandwich. Agree to get the meatloaf, and they'll act astonished that you're not getting the roast beef. It's all in fun, though, because all the sandwiches are terrific, better than the jokes, in fact. The fresh lemonade is wonderful, too, but don't try to tell that to the Ramirezes. ''It was pretty good, maybe, last time you had it,'' they'll tell you, ''but it's even better now.''</p>
        <p>10. Sandwich Planet</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 273-9768</p>
        <p>534 Ninth Avenue,</p>
        <p>near 40th Street</p>
        <p>Clinton</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>At this trim little takeout shop near the Port Authority Bus Terminal, you can design your own sandwich or order one of the classics, like the fine bacon, lettuce and tomato on sourdough bread, or meatloaf on white. Or try the Lollobrigida, named for the actress, a combination of bresaola, goat cheese and truffle oil, a perfect blend of salty, creamy and earthy, served on your choice of excellent breads.</p>
        <p>11. Sosa Borella</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 431-5093</p>
        <p>460 Greenwich Street, near Canal Street</p>
        <p>TriBeCa</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>From the extensive list of delicious sandwiches at midday to the Argentine menu that comes out at night, Sosa Borella, a quiet, handsome, out-of-the-way restaurant in TriBeCa, does well by its food. Among the best sandwiches are smoked turkey with brie and roasted peppers on a baguette, and prosciutto with mozzarella and roasted peppers on ciabatta. Meat is the focus of the Argentine dinner menu, with choices like a thin round steak flavored with garlic and parsley, lightly breaded, quickly fried and served with two fried eggs on top. It's delicious and helps motivate a workout the next day.</p>
        <p>12. Toast</p>
        <p>+++</p>
        <p>(212) 662-1144</p>
        <p>3157 Broadway,</p>
        <p>near Tiemann Place</p>
        <p>Morningside Heights</p>
        <p>$ Visa and Mastercard</p>
        <p>This pleasant coffeehouse serves a tender and beefy steak sandwich with just the right amount of grilled onions and peppers; a decent rendition of pork barbecue, thin-sliced, smoky and flavorful; a thick bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich; and other soups, salads and sandwiches. All sandwiches come with either a good little green salad or French fries, which are hand-cut, but like most French fries don't survive a steamy trip in a takeout container. Go for the salad. If you don't mind the loud music, it's a good place to sit with one of the excellent draft beers that are always available.</p>
