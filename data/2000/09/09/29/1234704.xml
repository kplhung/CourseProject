        <p>Staples Inc., the office-supply company, will open a Northeastern distribution center in the Orange County town of Montgomery, investing $40 million to buy and renovate a building formerly occupied by a company that is now bankrupt. The new warehouse is expected to employ 300 people by the end of next year, and 450 within five years, Staples said.</p>
        <p>Staples was the high bidder for the 760,000-square-foot building, 66 miles north of Manhattan, that was used by the Service Merchandise Company before it was forced into bankruptcy proceedings in which some of its assets are being sold, according to an announcement by Gov. George E. Pataki and Senator Charles E. Schumer.</p>
