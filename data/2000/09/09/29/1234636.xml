        <p>The federal government today renewed its contract with the private organization that runs the nation's organ transplant system, a move that appears to end two years of dispute over how scarce livers and other organs are distributed.</p>
        <p>After competitive bidding, the contract was again awarded to the United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit organization based in Richmond, Va., that had resisted new federal rules requiring organs to be distributed across broad geographic areas to the sickest patients first.</p>
        <p>The three-year contract explicitly calls for the network to accept those rules.</p>
        <p>''We're extremely pleased to have retained this important contract and thus continue to serve the needs of the more than 71,000 patients awaiting transplants,'' said Walter Graham, the network's executive director.</p>
        <p>The contract, Mr. Graham said, affirms the government's ''continued confidence in our ability.''</p>
        <p>But the contract does not give complete authority to the network, which has run the transplant system since the mid-1980's. The organization will continue to maintain the list of patients who are waiting for new organs and will run the computer system that matches waiting patients with donated organs.</p>
        <p>But federal health officials selected another organization, the University Renal Research and Education Association of Ann Arbor, Mich., to run the scientific registry that examines how transplant patients fare and how changes in organ distribution policy affect them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Claude Earl Fox, the administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, the Health Department unit that oversees the transplant system, said he hoped that the awarding of the contracts would help the government, ''settle the dust and move forward with the transplant community'' to improve the quality of care for patients.</p>
        <p>The contract with the Richmond group is worth $52 million over three years. About $1.5 million a year will come from taxpayers, while the rest comes from fees paid by transplant patients or their insurers. The Michigan group will receive $2.5 million a year from taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Today's decision came one day after Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, announced that she was creating an advisory committee on organ transplantation to help guide her on medical and ethical questions.</p>
        <p>In announcing the committee, Dr. Shalala said it would provide her with ''top-notch, science-based counsel on transplantation policy.'' She said the organ sharing network had worked over the summer to develop new policies for distributing livers, which are in especially short supply, and that the advisory committee would help assess those proposals.</p>
        <p>There are more than 62,000 Americans now waiting for donated organs, and each year, about 4,000 people die while they wait. As a result, the dispute over who should receive donated organs is intense.</p>
        <p>In 1998, when Dr. Shalala first proposed revamping the organ sharing system to force sharing across broad geographic regions, reaction to the proposal was swift and intense.</p>
        <p>Under the system that had been in effect since the mid-1980's, when the organ sharing network got its start, the country was divided into 62 local areas, which comprised 11 larger regions. Donated organs were first offered to patients in those local areas. Only if there was no need locally, were they offered in the larger regions.</p>
        <p>Citing great disparities in waiting times for transplants from region to region, Dr. Shalala argued that the old system was unfair and sought to replace it with one that would break down the old geographic barriers.</p>
        <p>The organ sharing network resisted, however, and soon the debate moved to Congress, which put the administration's rules on hold until March of this year.</p>
        <p>The debate was not only political but also economic. Small transplant centers feared that the new rules would put them out of business by steering organs to larger, big-city hospitals.</p>
        <p>In addition, transplant surgeons argued bitterly among themselves. Some states also stepped into the debate, passing legislation that would prevent organs from being shipped to neighboring states.</p>
        <p>Despite today's decision, Congress could still step in. The National Organ Transplant Act, the 1984 law that created the organ allocation system, expired several years ago and is up for reauthorization. Congress could use the reauthorization as an occasion to reshape the system yet again.</p>
