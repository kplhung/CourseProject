        <p>Contrary to rumors that the young British artist Damien Hirst has forsaken art for the business of advertising or restaurant running, he seems to have gone into overproduction. His third solo show in New York, which inaugurates the palatial redesign of the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea, is an extravaganza of paintings and room-size vitrine sculptures, including two that have been outfitted as gynecological examination rooms and then filled with water and fish, to great Surrealistic effect.</p>
        <p>Walking through this museum-size show, which can sometimes seem about twice too big, it is irresistible to wonder, first, which cost more, the renovation of the gallery or the production of the works on view, and, second, what Mr. Hirst would have done had he not had so much money at his disposal.</p>

        <p>Contrary to rumors that the young British artist Damien Hirst has forsaken art for the business of advertising or restaurant running, he seems to have gone into overproduction. His third solo show in New York, which inaugurates the palatial redesign of the Gagosian Gallery in Chelsea, is an extravaganza of paintings and room-size vitrine sculptures, including two that have been outfitted as gynecological examination rooms and then filled with water and fish, to great Surrealistic effect.</p>
        <p>Walking through this museum-size show, which can sometimes seem about twice too big, it is irresistible to wonder, first, which cost more, the renovation of the gallery or the production of the works on view, and, second, what Mr. Hirst would have done had he not had so much money at his disposal.</p>
        <p>But to a certain extent the ends justify the means. This is a strong show, far more coherent than the jumble of work Mr. Hirst presented in his previous Gagosian effort. There are undeniable duds. I would avoid anything with Ping-Pong balls, bobbing or stationary; also the pair of shrouded faux cadavers titled ''Adam and Eve.'' And the giant anatomical figure made of painted bronze in the front gallery might as well be a kiosk pointing the way to other works.</p>
        <p>Still, so long as the fish remain healthy, this exhibition shows Mr. Hirst moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce.</p>
        <p>This show presents what might be called the Damien Hirst Universe. It is a big, shiny place with gigantic graph-paper grids printed on many of the walls; pale dot paintings; expanses of gleaming glass, mirror and stainless steel; and scores of pristine, beautifully presented objects -- elements that frequently coalesce into moments of clarity and beauty and something approximating wisdom.</p>
        <p>Row upon row of shiny medical instruments occupy one wall vitrine along with two skeletons, separately coffered. In another, the handmade, actual-size models of 8,000 pills are laid out like gems on thin metal shelves. ''Trinity'' consists of three towering wall cabinets whose brightly colored anatomical mannequins and models of organs and limbs gaily deconstruct the human body.</p>
        <p>In the best works, Mr. Hirst brings the visual and mental, the material and the literary, into perfect balance. One shiny vitrine presents the artificial skeletons of two dozen small mammals, all perfect and white with their miraculous engineering everywhere apparent; it is as wonderful to look at them as structures as it is to identify the animals (several dogs and cats) and to find one's reverence encapsulated in the work's title, ''Something Solid Beneath the Surface of Several Things Wise and Wonderful.''</p>
        <p>The displays confirm that Mr. Hirst has raided every postwar art movement from Minimalism to Pop to Super Realism to Neo-Geo. His main feat is the appropriation of the Minimalist box. His vitrines and, now, vitrines-within-vitrines are crucial in the way they encase, monumentalize and aestheticize his tableaux and create a needed sense of distance for the viewer. And despite his Neo-Geo-like use of store-bought commodities, this show also reminds us that his work is so sincere, and even sweet at times, that it should be called post-postmodern.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirst's main objective seems to be to get us to look at the wonders and horrors of natural life and to realize not only that they are often the same thing, but also that both have been intensified by man's pursuit of knowledge. Another objective may be to simply prepare us for the inevitable: decline and death. It is somehow comforting to be introduced to all those medical instruments in the guise of art. The next time many of us see them, they may be being applied to our own bodies.</p>
        <p>He is interested in both sides of any position. In ''A Way of Seeing,'' he creates a comforting image of a scientist as bohemian and as seer: a meticulously real life-size sculpture inside a double vitrine depicts a man with a ponytail who is wearing a lab coat and jeans as he sits at a desk staring into a microscope, surrounded by a strip of sandy, carefree beach.</p>
        <p>Yet the pitfalls of progress are also in evidence. In ''Looking Forward to the Total and Absolute Suppression of Pain,'' a walk-in vitrine where the use of clear and mirrored glass may bring to mind the work of Dan Graham, four television monitors, installed at hospital-room height, blast the viewer with nonstop commercials for painkillers.</p>
        <p>There are moments when Mr. Hirst's pursuit of accessibility rolls over into obviousness, as in the segmented vitrine filled with plump garbage bags and room fresheners where the punch line is ''Stop Me B4 I Kill Again,'' scrawled on the tarnished mirror of an old wardrobe. And the way these works fit together and play against one another can make you wonder how some of them will stand on their own. But on the whole this exhibition gives New York a sense of Mr. Hirst as an artist with big, life-affirming messages to get across, determined to do so without preaching, and in terms as close to purely visual as possible.</p>
        <p>''Damien Hirst: Models, Methods, Approaches, Assumptions, Results and Findings'' is at the Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 741-1111, through Dec. 16.</p>
