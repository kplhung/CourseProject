        <p>Rangers Coach Ron Low and the rookie goaltender Jason LaBarbera were both asked tonight to name LaBarbera's strengths after he matched the Devils' Martin Brodeur save for save in a preseason game that ended in a 2-2 tie.</p>
        <p>They both came up with the same answer.</p>
        <p>''My size, I guess,'' said the 20-year-old LaBarbera, who is listed at 6 feet 2 inches and 205 pounds.</p>
        <p>''He's big,'' said Low, who was obviously impressed. ''And pretty solid, too.''</p>
        <p>LaBarbera was all that, and agile enough to stop 15 of 17 shots in his National Hockey League preseason debut.</p>
        <p>Last season, LaBarbera was tending goal in the Western Junior Hockey League. This week, he was making his first preseason start for the Rangers' top minor league affiliate in Hartford. And 94 seconds into the game tonight, LaBarbera was staring at a five-on-three advantage for the defending Stanley Cup champion Devils without giving up a goal.</p>
        <p>''What an adrenaline rush,'' he said. ''The first half of the game was all adrenaline for me. And what a nice way to start, with a five-on-three right off the bat.''</p>
        <p>LaBarbera played the entire game. He allowed two goals, both to defensemen, both on slap shots. The Devils' Colin White scored with the teams skating four to a side, 2 minutes 29 seconds into the game. Then Sascha Goc, who is bidding to make the Devils as their seventh defenseman, squeaked his first of the preseason past LaBarbera at 11:38 of the second period to give the Devils a 2-0 lead.</p>
        <p>But Petr Nedved and Valery Kamensky beat Brodeur 2:16 apart midway through the third period to rescue the Rangers, who have not beaten the Devils in a game that counted since the 1997 playoffs.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Rich Pilon played as if he were playing for his job.</p>
        <p>Despite reporting to camp in perhaps the best shape of his life, Pilon, 32, was left unprotected by the Rangers in Friday's N.H.L. waiver draft. But tonight he gave a rare display of the nastiness that he possessed years ago with the Islanders.</p>
        <p>Near the end of the first period, Pilon crunched the Devils' Ed Ward along the boards, then pummeled him in a fight with a series of lefts.</p>
        <p>''I want to play here,'' Pilon said. ''And my style is to hit.''</p>
        <p>Less than a year after the Rangers claimed Pilon off waivers from the Islanders, Pilon's future is in jeopardy as the Rangers seek ways to fit some younger defensemen on their roster. Dale Purinton, who turns 24 next week, should make the team. Despite his training-camp holdout, Mike Mottau, 22, has given himself a chance with his play this preseason. Hence the decision to leave Pilon unprotected.</p>
        <p>Despite his pugnacious play, Pilon was erratic: he gave up the puck in his own zone on what turned into the Devils' second goal.</p>
        <p>Goc is still in the running for a job because the Devils' best defenseman, Scott Niedermayer, remains unsigned, and Vladimir Malakhov, one of the top defensemen during their playoff run last season, signed with the Rangers this summer.</p>
        <p>LaBarbera shut out the Devils the rest of the way and may have earned him another shot with the Rangers, who are looking for someone to back up Kirk McLean until the injured Mike Richter is ready to play again.</p>
        <p>''We want somebody to step up and grab it,'' said Low, who has watched goalies Jean-Francois Labbe and Johan Holmqvist struggle in goal at times. ''Nobody has.''</p>
