        <p>Acknowledging that the city's Buildings Department has been mired in systemic corruption for at least three decades, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced steps yesterday to overhaul the agency by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>''I should have anticipated doing this six or seven years ago,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference attended by the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, who has conducted a series of fruitful investigations of the agency over the last quarter-century.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was no exception: two hours before Mr. Giuliani's news conference, Mr. Morgenthau held one of his own, announcing the indictments of five Buildings Department employees, including that of Deputy Commissioner Barry G. Cox, the second-ranking official at the agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox was charged with accepting gifts -- including a family trip to Florida, the use of an apartment, Rangers tickets and wine -- from a middleman, or ''expeditor,'' who had been hired to ease the way through the city's daunting approval process by a client with a building under construction. In exchange for the gifts, officials in Mr. Morgenthau's office said, the expeditor received building approvals for his client.</p>
        <p>''This kind of conduct is reprehensible,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''and it's not the kind of conduct that is acceptable on the part of any public official and in particular at high levels in city agencies. Unfortunately, when people violate the law like this, they have to be singled out and they have to be used as examples.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox is charged with two felony counts of failing to report the gifts on government disclosure forms and four misdemeanor counts of receiving unlawful gratuities. Mr. Cox's lawyer, John L. Pollok, did not return telephone messages left at his office and at home yesterday, but on Wednesday he said,  ''I am sure that my client will be fully vindicated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox, reached at home last night, said he had no comment on his indictment or the mayor's remarks. George Arzt, a friend of Mr. Cox's who worked with him in the Koch administration, said this week that the indictment was ''penny-ante stuff that represents a lapse in judgment but does not rise to a criminal indictment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said he would clean out the Buildings Department with the appointment of a task force, whose members -- chiefly commissioners of other agencies -- he announced at the news conference. The task force is to be headed by Bart M. Schwartz, a former prosecutor who worked for Mr. Giuliani when the mayor was a United States attorney.</p>
        <p>Although numerous city administrations have reacted to corruption in the Buildings Department by firing large numbers of inspectors, Mr. Giuliani is the first mayor to call for a top-to-bottom review. He appeared to address potential skepticism about the effectiveness of yet another task force when he said that he expected the group to report back in two months and that he wanted complete change. As an example, Mr. Giuliani said that the task force would consider having the Fire Department take over the buildings agency.</p>
        <p>He added that the task force could recommend tougher restrictions on inspectors who move back and forth between the Buildings Department and jobs in the construction industry, a practice agency critics say breeds cronyism and corruption.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also said that his desire to restructure the agency was not connected to the collapse of an apartment house in Brooklyn that killed a worker last year and whose builder had sought help from City Hall. ''I would not connect the two things,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''I don't see any connection between this investigation and that one. None.''</p>
        <p>The indictments of the Buildings Department officials, along with three others, came as a result of a two-year joint investigation by Mr. Morgenthau's office and the city's Department of Investigation. Officials said they originally focused on expeditors, some of whom were arrested midway through the investigation. They pleaded guilty, officials said, and then cooperated with the investigation by providing information about the Buildings Department. At least one expeditor wore concealed recording equipment.</p>
        <p>Edward J. Kuriansky, the commissioner of the Department of Investigation, said yesterday that the indictments were notable in that they reached to such a high level at the Buildings Department. ''And if these people have their hands out,'' Mr. Kuriansky said, ''what can we expect from lower-level personnel?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuriansky added that although there were only about 200 buildings inspectors, more than 100 were arrested and charged with crimes in the last decade.</p>
