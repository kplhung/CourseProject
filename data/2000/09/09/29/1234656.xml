        <p>They were rustled in the dead of night and sprayed with graffiti, saddled by children and derided by critics. And last night the cows of the city's CowParade New York 2000 did yeoman's service one more time, raising $1.35 million for charity.</p>
        <p>As featured cows rose up and down on hydraulic lifts in the ornate former bank lobby of Cipriani 42nd Street, a sold-out crowd that had paid up to $350 per ticket bid enthusiastically, with most of the cows going for several times their estimated prices.</p>
        <p>The highest bid of $60,000 went to Adele Moros's ''Tiffany Cow,'' painted to look like stained glass. A cow by the pop artist Peter Max went for $24,000, as did a cow that unfolds into a real piano. The president of a chain of Japanese steakhouses, Tony Fujita, bought two cows, paying $48,000 for ''Lady Cowdiva,'' a ladylike cow seated atop a Holstein, by Tim Gaydos, and $24,000 for ''La Vie Bovine,'' by Matt Maraffi.</p>
        <p>For the auction, a committee selected 75 of the 500 life-size cows, each sponsored by a corporation, civic group, cultural institution or other organization. The cows were deployed in public spaces this summer, with most of them, 480, in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Most of the remaining 425 cows, including one that was signed by the cast of the television show ''Survivor,'' which took place on a cow-free tropical isle, are being sold on Amazon.com in an auction that began at 12:01 a.m. today. Bidding closes on Oct. 9.</p>
        <p>Proceeds will benefit charities chosen by the city, including the City Parks Foundation, God's Love We Deliver, Hale House, City Meals-on-Wheels, New Yorkers for Children and the Center for Arts Education, organizers said.</p>
        <p>Though each artist began with one of only three fiberglass cow models (standing, grazing or seated), the designs ranged widely. Among the crowd pleasers was a  cow with a Slinky toy body, which sold for $34,000. On the head-scratching side, there was ''Ceci N'est Pas une Vache'' (''this is not a cow,'' a reference to a painting by Rene Magritte, ''Ceci N'est Pas une Pipe''). It was not among those auctioned last night.</p>
        <p>There were cows hailing taxis, cows covered in ersatz moola and a cow catching a Frisbee in its mouth. But there were no sliced cows a la Damien Hirst, the British artist whose work in ''Sensation,'' at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, caused a stir last year.</p>
        <p>The cows, billed as the first public art event to be held in all five boroughs, were popular with tourists but derided by many locals, who pointed out that New York is not the cow town that Chicago, the first city in the United States to play host to a cow parade, can claim to be.</p>
        <p>Art critics, too, bemoaned what they called the hokey designs and the hackneyed puns in the titles. (''Moo York'' was used a dozen times.) Roberta Smith, writing in The New York Times, located the hoofed creations ''somewhere between a Happening and an art class at summer camp.''</p>
        <p>Such slings and arrows, it seems, placed Pat Smith, a spokesman for CowParade Holdings Inc., on the defensive.</p>
        <p>''In answer to the question, 'Is this really art?' '' he wrote to a reporter, ''we offer representatives from Phillips Auctioneers, the third-largest auction house in the world, which is lending its prestige to this event and providing its services at no charge.''</p>
        <p>New York's cows did not fetch as high a price as Chicago's, which went for an average of $42,000 at its auction, as opposed to $18,000 per cow last night, according to figures given by Jerry Elbaum, the president of CowParade Holdings. In Chicago, a cow decorated with handprints of patients at a children's hospital went for $110,000.</p>
        <p>Oprah Winfrey spent $110,000 on three cows. But she had a place to put them: her Indiana farm. Where, on the other hand, would the average New York auctiongoer put one of the statues?</p>
        <p>Barbi Benton, the actress and singer, hoped to take home 20 cows for her 40-acre sculpture garden in Aspen, Colo. (She got none, but plans to shop online.)</p>
        <p>Oliver Mendell, a senior officer at Chase Manhattan Bank, said that if he bid successfully on  ''Twin Cowers,'' two cows modeled after the World Trade Center, he would put them in his summer house. ''Pound Ridge, New York,'' he said. ''Everybody has a summer house, don't they?''</p>
        <p>Naomi Campbell of Park Slope, Brooklyn, said her paintings never sold for as much as her cow, which was auctioned off for $24,000 by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. But, she said, ''that more than made up for it tonight when I saw how much the cow went for.''</p>
