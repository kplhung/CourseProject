        <p>Editorial supports bill to permit imports of American-made pharmaceutical drugs that are sold at low prices abroad</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Now that the Republican leadership has joined forces with President Clinton, Congress is almost certain to pass a bill that would permit imports of  American-made pharmaceutical drugs that are sold at low prices abroad. The Republican leaders may have come around to the idea to insulate themselves from charges that they have failed to protect Medicare and other patients from soaring drug prices. To be sure, a proposal designed to lower price is by no means a sufficient answer to the problem that millions of the elderly have no coverage for prescription drugs. Yet it is worth trying in an effort to curb prices and instill more evenness in global pricing.</p>
        <p>American manufacturers often sell patented drugs abroad for less than they charge in the United States. One analysis showed that a month's supply of an osteoporosis drug sold for $170 in the United States but only $45 in Canada and $51 in Mexico. The typical discount for patented drugs is smaller. Taking into account price reductions offered to Americans enrolled in managed care or otherwise insured, foreign drugs probably sell for 15 to 30 percent less. Under current law, wholesalers are not permitted to buy American-manufactured drugs abroad and resell them in the United States. The proposed bill would remove that prohibition.</p>

        <p>Now that the Republican leadership has joined forces with President Clinton, Congress is almost certain to pass a bill that would permit imports of  American-made pharmaceutical drugs that are sold at low prices abroad. The Republican leaders may have come around to the idea to insulate themselves from charges that they have failed to protect Medicare and other patients from soaring drug prices. To be sure, a proposal designed to lower price is by no means a sufficient answer to the problem that millions of the elderly have no coverage for prescription drugs. Yet it is worth trying in an effort to curb prices and instill more evenness in global pricing.</p>
        <p>American manufacturers often sell patented drugs abroad for less than they charge in the United States. One analysis showed that a month's supply of an osteoporosis drug sold for $170 in the United States but only $45 in Canada and $51 in Mexico. The typical discount for patented drugs is smaller. Taking into account price reductions offered to Americans enrolled in managed care or otherwise insured, foreign drugs probably sell for 15 to 30 percent less. Under current law, wholesalers are not permitted to buy American-manufactured drugs abroad and resell them in the United States. The proposed bill would remove that prohibition.</p>
        <p>Yet the savings to consumers will almost certainly be smaller than sponsors expect because there are many ways the manufacturers can minimize the impact. The drug companies might raise their prices abroad, cutting the price differential. Or they might restrict exports to levels that foreign countries will absorb for their own use, leaving little for wholesalers to import back to the United States. Or they might change the dimensions of the pills sold abroad so they are no longer the same as the drugs that are approved for sale in this country. The rules that federal regulators will issue to insure that reimported drugs are safe will add to costs, wiping out some of the potential saving.</p>
        <p>Yet the proposal is worth trying for the simple reason that American patients now bear the brunt of development costs for drugs that are used worldwide. Protected by patent laws and the prohibition against imports, American manufacturers charge high prices in the domestic market. The profits cover the cost of finding the next blockbuster drug. Having recovered development costs in the domestic market, manufacturers can sell abroad at low, government-set prices and still add to their profits. The proposed legislation would attempt to tilt the market in favor of American consumers.</p>
        <p>If the proposal works as promised, and thus lowers the profit margins of drug companies, there is some risk that manufacturers might cut their research budgets for new drugs. That risk seems small because the incentive to discover new drugs would remain substantial. The drug import bill is no substitute for providing prescription drug coverage for the elderly. But it is worth enacting because it might do some good and poses no great harm.</p>
