      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE ANDREAS, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. With her high sweet soprano and eager intensity, Ms. Andreas embodies an eternal ingenue who is just waking up to the realization that life doesn't have a fairy-tale ending. Although the smart Brazilian-flavored arrangements for a pop-jazz quartet led by Lee Musiker don't always match her floating Broadway lyricism, Ms. Andreas leaves her romantic imprint on songs like ''He Loves Me,'' ''How Insensitive,'' ''And So It Goes'' and Dave Frishberg's wonderful, little-known ballad ''Listen Here.'' Through Oct. 14. Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; dinner available but not required 6 p.m. to midnight (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>CHRISTINE ANDREAS, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. With her high sweet soprano and eager intensity, Ms. Andreas embodies an eternal ingenue who is just waking up to the realization that life doesn't have a fairy-tale ending.

Through Oct. 14. Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; dinner available but not required 6 p.m. to midnight (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>''BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 239-6200. If this is not a flawless revue, it is nevertheless an ingratiating tribute to Kurt Weill's achievement. Today, Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Wednesday at 3 p.m.; Sunday at 4:30 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>* HOWARD FISHMAN QUARTET, Sardi's, 234 West 44th Street, (212) 221-8440. Powerful echoes of Stephane Grappelli and Bix Beiderbecke are among the influences rippling through the Howard Fishman Quartet's seamless swing. The group -- Mr. Fishman on guitar, banjo and vocals; Russell Farhang playing virtuosic Grappelli-style violin; Erik Jekabson on trumpet; Jonathan Flaugher on bass -- folds elements of vintage jazz, swing and early bluegrass into rhythmically animated, richly allusive jazz chamber music. Whether the music is Stephen Foster (a bubbly ''Old Folks at Home''), Gershwin (''Soon'') or Romberg (''When I Grow Too Old to Dream''), it is all translated into lilting, fine-tuned ensemble music that transcends time and idiom. Friday nights at 10:30. No cover charge, but $15 minimum at tables (Holden).</p>
        <p>KAREN MASON, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. The high-strung, likable performer from Chicago still exudes the effervescent eagerness of a hometown drama student who has just arrived in New York bursting with starry-eyed ambition. Her new cabaret show concentrates on popular standards. High points include zany 60's cabaret numbers like Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh's ''When in Rome'' and Stephen Sondheim and Mary Rodgers's bossa nova spoof, ''The Boy From . . .'' But her big ballads are undermined by a tendency to overbelt. Friday and Saturday nights at 8:30 and 11; Sunday nights at 8; Wednesday and Thursday nights at 9. Through Oct. 15. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at Arci's Place, Mondays at 8, Jim Caruso in ''Live and in Person,'' with musical direction and piano accompaniment by Billy Stritch. Through Dec. 18. Cover: $25; $15 minimum. (Holden).</p>
        <p>* MAUREEN MCGOVERN, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. Ms. McGovern's gorgeous voice and the melodies of Richard Rodgers were meant for each other. This singer's demureness and sense of proportion prevent Rodgers and Hammerstein ballads like ''Climb Ev'ry Mountain'' and ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' from turning to mush. She brings a fine mixture of wit and precision to Rodgers and Hart standards like ''To Keep My Love Alive.'' Not only is the singer the closest American equivalent to Julie Andrews in her vocal prime, but she also adds a jazzy, coloratura panache. Through Oct. 14. Friday and Saturday nights at 9 and 11:30; Tuesday through Thursday nights at 9. Cover: $50, with dinner required for early shows on Fridays and Saturdays; $15 minimum for other shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7. Also at the Algonquin, Sunday jazz brunch at 2 p.m. (seating begins at 12:30), Laverne Butler, singer. Cover: $50, includes brunch. International Festival of Cabaret: Sunday night at 9, Michel Hermon, singer; Monday night at, Natlie Gamsu, singer; $40 cover and $15 minimum; Sundays and Mondays through October (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes. He focuses on what he calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight and Monday through Wednesday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55; ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).</p>
