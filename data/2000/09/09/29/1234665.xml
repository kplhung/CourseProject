        <p>Turner, Claude Lorrain, painters of the Hudson River School and other masters of 17th- to 19th-century landscape are brought into these gigantic canvases by the Danish painter Nina Sten-Knudsen, with the aim of joining then with now.

        <p>'The Landscape, Later'</p>
        <p>DCA Gallery</p>

        <p>Turner, Claude Lorrain, painters of the Hudson River School and other masters of 17th- to 19th-century landscape are brought into these gigantic canvases by the Danish painter Nina Sten-Knudsen, with the aim of joining then with now. Ms. Sten-Knudsen does not so much paint the romantic landscape as she paints about it, revisiting in post-past fashion questions of space, perspective, figuration and other approaches taken for granted in pre-20th-century work.</p>
        <p>Her scenes, complicated by layers of allusion and multiple focuses not governed by perspective, can't be read in conventional landscape terms. In the show's title painting, ''Landscape, Later,'' for instance, a vast Turneresque terrain of theatrical intensity opens up, with hazy distant peaks and a romantic sunset. But a heavy cloud bank of unrelieved black suggests the monochrome space of modern paintings.</p>
        <p>More in the Hudson River School line, trees, tiny figures and a rustic cabin appear at various distances, while close up there are two ancestral images from 19th-century photographs and, at right, a realistic vignette of a figure bent over what could be a typewriter. As a questioning of traditional landscape, this medley doesn't really work, but its scale and ambition makes it interesting.</p>
        <p>In ''Sigma,'' a network of twinkling city lights is superimposed on a dark background of painted and photographed monumental ruins from the past combined with painted and photographed fragments of present-day structures and advertising signs. A panel flush next to it is a pure monochrome gray rectangle meant, I take it, to convey contemporary concerns and also to cool down the busyness of the adjacent scene. But the whole comes off as more of a stage backdrop than a painting in depth.</p>
        <p>Still, although their execution leaves something to be desired, the ideas of landscape as theater in this show are worth examining.</p>
