        <p>HE is called Mad Dog the way bald guys are called Curly, or penny-pinchers are called Big Spenders. It is the flip side of what is. If he were, in fact, a canine, he might be the ultimate thinking man's pooch, a bloodhound, say, or one of those Labrador retrievers who remarkably leads the cops to the packet where the coke is stashed.</p>
        <p>If there has ever been a cooler, craftier, better-controlled pitcher mentally, physically and even facially than Greg (Mad Dog) Maddux, it had to be Sidd Finch, or at least Christy Mathewson. It's true that the surname Maddux lends an alliterative lilt to the nickname, but it fits perfectly for its opposite implications.</p>
        <p>Last night, Maddux went to the mound for Atlanta against the Mets looking for this 20th victory against eight losses this season, seeking to extend his scoreless inning streak that stood at 361/3  innings -- the equivalent of four games and a few tokens -- and in conspicuous contention for the Cy Young Award, which would be his fifth, a major league record.</p>
        <p>But after three perfect innings, Maddux ran into trouble in the fourth when the Mets scored three times, primarily on two infield hits and a  single to right by Todd Pratt. It ended Maddux's scoreless streak at 39 1/3 innings.</p>
        <p>This was less than Maddux's most fortunate outing. He allowed one solid hit in the game, the single by Pratt, while walking two and striking out seven. But the Mets had a 4-1 lead by the time he left after five innings, and wound up winning by 8-2. ''I thought I pitched good,'' Maddux said. ''I wanted to pitch good enough to win, but I pitched good enough to lose.''</p>
        <p>It wasn't just personal gain Maddux was after, but a victory for his team, too. While the Braves have won the National League East title, they still haven't secured home-field advantage in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Maddux was facing a Mets team that was still in seventh heaven, and perhaps with champagne lingering in its hair, after having beaten the Braves the night before to clinch the wild-card berth.</p>
        <p>The bill of Mad Dog's cap always looks a little too long, and so the inexpressive eyes in his small, college-sophomore-like face appear to be viewing things from within a cave. He appears no more imposing on the mound than some groundskeeper, no lanky rancor of Randy Johnson, no lean nefariousness of Pedro Martinez, none of the portly desperado of David Wells. Mad Dog stands 6 feet tall, weighs 185 pounds and doesn't throw as hard as any of the other top pitchers in the game. His breaking balls aren't eye-popping. His weapons, however, are the equivalent of an artist's palette.</p>
        <p>''I've been the pitching coach with the Braves for eight years,'' said Leo Mazzone, ''and I'm still in awe of Mad Dog. When he's going well, as he has recently, he can hit the target about 97 percent of the time. He does it with various speeds on his fastballs, and his breaking balls go in on both right-handed and left-handed hitters, and away from them. Most pitchers can do one or the other. And his changeup is virtually pin-point perfect.''</p>
        <p>Mazzone also remembers a time when Maddux threw close to Eddie Murray, who made noises that Maddux was trying to hit him. The Braves' catcher, Charlie O'Brien, said to Murray: ''Eddie, relax. Mad Dog's control is so good that if he wanted to hit you, he'd hit you right between the eyes.''</p>
        <p>Maddux, at age 34 and in his 15th big league season, had a rocky start, for him, this season. Yet in his eight losses, he has given up a paltry 13 runs. He had a 2.91 earned run average, just shy of his 2.82 mark coming into the season.</p>
        <p>''Everything is on the corners, or two inches off,'' said Jay Payton, the Mets' center fielder. ''He never gives you a cookie, one right down the middle. And every time you think you've outguessed him, you gotta guess again.''</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, Bobby Cox, the Braves' manager, went to the mound and suggested to Maddux that he walk the next hitter. Maddux told him, no, he'd get the batter to pop to third.</p>
        <p>''Bobby came back to the bench,'' Mazzone recalled, ''and the batter popped to third. Bobby said, 'Well, I'll be.' I asked him what it was. And he said, 'Mad Dog told me exactly what he was going to make the guy do -- and he did it!' ''</p>
        <p>Maddux was asked about this Wednesday. ''I don't remember it,'' he said with a sly smile.</p>
        <p>''Don't remember it?'' came the response. ''You who makes a study of every pitch to every batter in every inning?'' ''Well, it's pitching,'' Maddux replied. ''Hitters read that stuff  -- or someone tells 'em about it. I don't want them knowing what I'm thinking.''</p>
        <p>But last night, even against the mighty Maddux, the Mets had an inkling, and that turned out to be more than enough.</p>
