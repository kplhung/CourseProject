        <p>It promises to be the political fund-raising event of the fall season in New York. The cost to attend is as much as $100,000 for an evening of cocktails and dinner at a Manhattan hotel, alongside some of the most powerful Republicans in the state.</p>
        <p>And a featured speaker at the dinner, which is expected to raise several million dollars in soft money for the state Republican Party, is Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate, who has mounted something of a crusade in recent weeks to expunge soft money from the race for Senate.</p>
        <p>The Lazio campaign yesterday defended the candidate's decision to lend his imprimatur to the event, saying the money would be used for voter drives, not commercials, and so would not violate an agreement he reached with Hillary Rodham Clinton that restricted the use of soft money. Still, his prominent role at the fund-raiser was disclosed as the  agreement, announced with some fanfare over the weekend, seemed to be fraying on several fronts.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is now in California, raising soft money, though, she said again there yesterday, not for her commercials. And an abortion rights group declared yesterday that it would not abide by the deal and had prepared a commercial attacking Mr. Lazio that it would most likely put on the air in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>These developments reinforce what aides to both campaigns have acknowledged in recent days: that for all the talk of principle by Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton in embracing a soft-money ban, both sides are conducting business very much as usual.</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton sought to present themselves as trailblazers in campaign reform, their aides are describing the pact as a pragmatic and shaky gesture. For Mr. Lazio, it was a way to seize an instant financial advantage over Mrs. Clinton, because she has a strong edge over him in this type of contribution. His aides said Mr. Lazio is preparing to overwhelm Mrs. Clinton with spending of the more regulated kinds of funds known as hard money, where he has the decided advantage.</p>
        <p>For Mrs. Clinton, it was a chance to clear the deck of a troublesome issue.</p>
        <p>The campaigns also acknowledged another calculation yesterday: this agreement could easily crumble in the final weeks before the election -- and neither side would be unhappy if it did. Both candidates and their allies are thus amassing large amounts of soft money, which, they said, they will be prepared to dump into television advertising at the first sign that the deal is collapsing.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Lazio said yesterday that his agreement to be one of the banner names at what state Republicans described as their premier soft-money fund-raiser of the year would not violate the deal and was not inconsistent with his recent denunciations of such fund-raising practices. They said the money raised would be used only for get-out-the-vote efforts,  which are permitted under the deal,  and not for television advertisements.</p>
        <p>''This is a party fund-raiser,'' said Dan McLagan, Mr. Lazio's communications director. ''This is party-building. This is to get out the vote.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has insisted in recent weeks that he has not raised soft money specifically for the campaign because he has not set up a special committee to do so, as Mrs. Clinton has. Her soft-money committee has taken in several million dollars in contributions that have paid for extensive advertising, which, according to the agreement, should have stopped as of this past Wednesday.  Still, by helping to sponsor the event, Mr. Lazio is now essentially raising soft money for the state party.</p>
        <p>Soft money is collected by party committees in unlimited amounts in an effort to get around strict limits on contributions to candidates. Soft money is not supposed to be spent to help candidates directly, but in recent years, the parties have bought commercials that promote or criticize candidates without mentioning the election.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, denounced Mr. Lazio for taking part in the fund-raiser. ''Rick Lazio has repeatedly looked New Yorkers in the eye and said he wasn't raising or spending soft money,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''We now know that was a lie.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McLagan noted that in the protracted negotiations between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio over soft money, Mr. Lazio had offered to cease raising soft money entirely, and Mrs. Clinton had declined. She said she wanted the agreement to cover only commercials.</p>
        <p>''She didn't want to deal,'' Mr. McLagan said. ''She very pointedly excluded that. Now she's gallivanting across the country raising goodness knows how much money for goodness knows what groups.''</p>
        <p>He asserted that Mrs. Clinton's campaign was now guilty of hypocrisy: ''She wants to raise soft money and say that Rick can't do that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio brought the issue of soft money to the fore at his debate with Mrs. Clinton in Buffalo two weeks ago, when he walked across the stage and demanded that she sign a form promising to renounce the use of such contributions. She declined. Mr. McLagan said that at the time, Mr. Lazio had already agreed to lend his name to the Republican Party soft-money fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>After prodding Mrs. Clinton into agreeing to the ban, Mr. Lazio has embraced it as a central element of his candidacy. ''If you look at who's got credibility on this issue, has been calling for campaign finance reform, who's been calling on a ban for soft money, who's not been raising soft money in his campaign, who's not been spending soft money on his campaign, we've been doing it,'' he said on ''This Week'' on ABC last Sunday.</p>
        <p>The hosts of the Republican fund-raiser -- the New York Victory 2000 dinner -- on Oct. 11 are Gov. George E. Pataki; William D. Powers, the state Republican Party chairman; and Earle I. Mack, a real estate developer. Individual tickets cost $1,000, which covers cocktails and dinner only. Individuals and corporations raising or contributing $100,000 or more get 17 tickets to attend what a memorandum sent to potential Republican contributors describes as a ''photo-op reception'' with Republican dignitaries, which is likely to include Mr. Lazio, officials said.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Lazio, among those being honored are Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who himself has been critical of the use of soft money, even though he held a fund-raiser to collect such funds when he was in the race against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's senior political adviser, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, defended the mayor's decision to attend the event and said that based on his understanding of the event, it would not violate the agreement that Mr. Lazio reached with the first lady. Mr. Teitelbaum had initially moved to form a soft-money committee to run advertisements on behalf of Mr. Lazio, but abandoned the effort in light of the agreement.</p>
        <p>''The event, as I understand it, is a generic Republican effort to turn out the vote on Election Day,'' Mr. Teitelbaum said. ''Hillary Clinton, true to form, will try to distort the truth and spin this into something it's not.''</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, the state affiliate of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League held a news conference to denounce the soft-money agreement. Under the agreement, the two campaigns have urged the political parties and advocacy groups to cease buying commercials to influence the contest.</p>
        <p>The abortion rights group, which supports Mrs. Clinton, said it had produced a commercial attacking Mr. Lazio's record on abortion, but would not put it on the air immediately. Its executive director, Kelli Conlin, said she was concerned that if the group did so, the fact that it was breaking the agreement might overshadow the ad's content.</p>
        <p>''We have an important message to get out to voters,'' Ms. Conlin said, adding that the Clinton and Lazio campaigns were trying to suppress the free-speech rights of legitimate advocacy groups.</p>
        <p>The Conservative Leadership Political Action Committee, which opposes Mrs. Clinton, has also pledged to run commercials soon.</p>
