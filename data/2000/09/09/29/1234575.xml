        <p>The testimony of a Libyan double-agent once expected to be the star witness in the Lockerbie trial ended today after defense lawyers accused him of being not only a liar but also a black market currency dealer and an opportunist hoping for the $4 million reward offered by the United States.</p>
        <p>But his closing morning on the stand was somewhat overshadowed later in the day by a set of odd and hostile exchanges between the defense and an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
        <p>The agent, Harold M. Hendershot, has been part of the Lockerbie case since the early days, watching search teams pick up pieces of Pan Am 103 on the Scottish moors. He was called today by the prosecution, apparently to bolster details of testimony given by Abdul Majid Giaka, the Libyan turncoat who had just been subjected to two days of withering cross-examination.</p>
        <p>For the first few minutes, Mr. Hendershot explained how, in an interview aboard an American warship off the Mediterranean island of Malta in July 1991, Mr. Abdul Majid claimed he saw the defendants, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, in late 1988. They were carrying a brown Samsonite suitcase through customs at the Malta airport, Mr. Abdul Majid said.</p>
        <p>The point is important because the defense asserts that Mr. Abdul Majid made up the incident in 1991 in a bid to get the F.B.I. to adopt him as a protected witness. Investigators believe that the bomb that blew up Pan Am 103, killing 270 people, was in a brown plastic suitcase checked in as unaccompanied luggage in Malta.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendershot said he remembered that Mr. Abdul Majid was ''very general'' about the date in his July 1991 interview, saying he had seen the suitcase sometime between October and December 1988.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdul Majid later became more specific, claiming to remember the exact date and giving other details about the day.</p>
        <p>But when the defense began to cross-examine Mr. Hendershot, he became very vague about details of his own investigation. He even answered that he did not remember whether one suspect he tried to interview had spit in his face.</p>
        <p>Presented with the chance to question Mr. Hendershot, the defense had shifted the ground away from the Libyans. Its own theory is that Pan Am 103 was blown up by a Palestinian terrorist cell based in Germany working with another in Sweden. Scottish investigators have said the German group was their prime suspects for many months, until attention shifted to the Libyans.</p>
        <p>The defense lawyers, William Taylor and Richard Keen, asked Mr. Hendershot about a trip he took to Sweden in 1989 to investigate the Palestinian group led by Muhammad Abu Talb, who was in prison there for other bombings. He confirmed that he had asked the Swedish police to get a warrant to search Mr. Talb's apartment.</p>
        <p>But he repeatedly answered ''I don't recall'' to questions about the apartment's contents: whether it contained disassembled clocks and watches and barometric devices -- all potential bomb triggers; whether it contained clothing made in Malta,  as clothing wrapped around the Lockerbie bomb was; whether it contained a calendar with a circle around the date of the bombing, Dec. 21, 1988.</p>
        <p>Mr. Keen was openly skeptical about Mr. Hendershot's vague recollection and his contention that he had not taken any notes during the search.</p>
        <p>''Isn't that unusual,'' Mr. Keen asked imperiously, ''for an F.B.I. agent to attend a search and not take notes?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendershot replied that notes might not be taken when the search was in a foreign country.</p>
        <p>That followed an even rougher exchange with Mr. Taylor, the other defense lawyer, who expressed disdain that Mr. Hendershot could not remember whether Mr. Talb had spit on him.</p>
        <p>''Would you look at your notes please overnight and come see me tomorrow?'' Mr. Taylor asked.</p>
        <p>He later told the court that he would not recall the agent to the stand, ''as I can get the information I need from other witnesses.''</p>
