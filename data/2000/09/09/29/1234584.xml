        <p>After Keyshawn Johnson was traded, Vinny Testaverde tweaked his former teammate by saying that Curtis Martin, not Johnson, was the team's most valuable player. Here's more proof:</p>
        <p>Martin was named the American Football Conference's offensive player of the month, largely because of his contributions in the Jets' 21-17 defeat of Tampa Bay, during which Johnson caught 1 pass for 1 yard.</p>
        <p>Martin has 88 carries for 331 yards -- second to Denver's Michael Anderson in the A.F.C. -- and two touchdowns, as well as 17 catches for 105 yards and 2 touchdowns. He is third in the conference with four touchdowns. He also, of course, threw the season's most heralded touchdown pass, the 18-yard halfback option lob to Wayne Chrebet that beat Tampa Bay. Martin also caught a pass from Testaverde, broke two tackles and scored the touchdown that, combined with a 2-point conversion, pulled the Jets to within 17-14.</p>
        <p>Martin has had a hand in fourth-quarter game-winning touchdowns in two of the team's four victories. He caught the game-winning 3-yard touchdown pass with 3 minutes 28 seconds remaining to beat Green Bay in the opener.</p>
        <p>''Curtis puts a smile on your face,'' Coach Al Groh said. ''The way you see him play is just the tip of the effort he's put forth in many behind-the-scenes ways. There are not many jobs you give Curtis Martin that aren't done at a high level of excellence.''</p>
        <p>It was the first time Martin was named player of the month.</p>
        <p>Testing, Testing, 1,2. . . .</p>
        <p>Now that the mini-tsunami over Vinny Testaverde's displeasure has died down, Coach Al Groh today offered an explanation for why the appropriate player substitutions were not always made against Tampa Bay. Testaverde had referred to this when he spoke of everyone needing to be accountable for the offense's troubles.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Groh said, the radio headsets that the Jets coaches use to communicate with the quarterback were not functioning. The system did not work for the entire game. The coaches on the sideline could talk to the coaches calling the plays in the press box, but the coaches on the sideline -- primarily the assistant head coach Maurice Carthon and the tight ends coach Ken Whisenhunt -- had to use hand signals to relay plays to Testaverde.</p>
        <p>Groh said the problem has occurred intermittently in previous games, but this was the first time the system was down for the entire game.</p>
        <p>Revenge for Another Jet</p>
        <p>Wayne Chrebet probably took special pleasure in beating Tampa Bay this week. But consider how thrilled Laveranues Coles was.</p>
        <p>Coles, the rookie wide receiver, had requested an interview with Bucs representatives during the predraft combine in Indianapolis. Coles hoped to convince teams that he was a good citizen, despite his dismissal from the Florida State team following his involvement in a department store scandal. Jets Coach Al Groh talked to Coles at the combine, but the Bucs refused.</p>
        <p>Playing in place of the injured Vincent Brisby, Coles had two catches, his first as a pro, and caught the 2-point conversion pass in the fourth quarter. Coles did not know he was going to play until just before game time. He had not taken many repetitions during practice as a receiver and had to do a quick cram session with the playbook in the minutes before the game.</p>
        <p>Coles impressed Groh during the combine interview because he was forthright about his troubled past. Since he arrived, Coles has remained quiet, declining to speak about the incidents that continue to hang over him. But he has a guardian in the veteran Dwight Stone, one of the most well-liked and respected members of the locker room. Stone has taken Coles under his wing, and, among other things, conveyed the importance of excelling on special teams as an entry to the team. Stone even kept in touch with Coles after he was cut and before he was brought back to the team, largely just because Groh wanted him around.</p>
        <p>''He's a bright spot in my football career,'' Coles said of Stone. ''He said, 'Listen to me, I won't steer you in the wrong direction.' I did that. I didn't know how important special teams are, and it took Dwight to explain how important it is.''</p>
