        <p>Nat Fein, who won a Pulitzer Prize for capturing one of the sports world's most poignant images, a rear-view photograph of a dying Babe Ruth receiving his final accolade at Yankee Stadium in June 1948, died Tuesday at Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood, N.J.

        <p>Nat Fein, who won a Pulitzer Prize for capturing one of the sports world's most poignant images, a rear-view photograph of a dying Babe Ruth receiving his final accolade at Yankee Stadium in June 1948, died Tuesday at Pascack Valley Hospital in Westwood, N.J. He was 86 and lived in Tappan, N.Y.</p>
        <p>In his three decades with The New York Herald Tribune, Mr. Fein, who called himself ''just a human-interest photographer,'' took thousands of pictures evoking life in New York. Using a bulky Speed Graphic camera, he photographed circus elephants sleeping, Mayor Fiorello La Guardia leading the Sanitation Department orchestra, and Dr. Albert Schweitzer kneeling to shake a little girl's hand.</p>
        <p>On the rainy afternoon of Sunday, June 13, 1948, Mr. Fein was at Yankee Stadium when Ruth, terminally ill with throat cancer, appeared at home plate in his old uniform at a ceremony marking the stadium's silver anniversary season.</p>
        <p>''When we were in the dressing room, he sat beside his old No. 3 locker and we made a picture there,'' Mr. Fein wrote in an unpublished memoir. ''Then he pulled out the belt showing how much thinner he'd got and I wanted to make a picture then, but they told me he's going to have all he can do to get out there -- he's a very sick man -- and the least bother here as possible because there's going to be a ceremony outside.</p>
        <p>''He came over to home plate. Of course, the story was No. 3 bows out, the uniform being retired and all, and as they played 'Auld Lang Syne,' I was trying to make a picture showing No. 3, but it's only on his back. So I walked around behind with the band still playing 'Auld Lang Syne' and there was his figure, his thin legs compared to his bulky body, and his No. 3 showing. So I made the picture from his back.''</p>
        <p>The photo of Ruth leaning on a bat he borrowed from the star pitcher Bob Feller, whose Cleveland Indians played the Yankees that day, appeared on Page 1 of The Herald Tribune. Mr. Fein sent a copy to Ruth, asking him to autograph it, but Ruth never responded. On Aug. 16, 1948, Ruth died at age 53.</p>
        <p>Reflecting on the picture, which brought him the Pulitzer Prize for news photography in 1949, Mr. Fein once said, ''I didn't think it was a great shot,'' but he acknowledged that he ''got the feeling'' of the moment.</p>
        <p>Nathaniel Fein was born in Manhattan, joined The Herald Tribune as a copy boy in the early 1930's and became a staff photographer in 1939. He served as a photographer in the Army Air Forces during World War II, then returned to The Herald Tribune and remained there until it went out of business in 1966.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fein's photographs appeared in Edward Steichen's ''Family of Man'' show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1955, and a collection of his photos was published as ''Nat Fein's Animals'' (Gilbert Press, 1955).</p>
        <p>He is survived by a son, David, of Tappan.</p>
