        <p>Efforts by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to champion grand new ballparks for the Yankees and the Mets took a fresh turn yesterday, with the mayor proposing a financing formula in which each team would pay one-third of the costs of new stadiums. He said the city and state should divide the remaining costs down the middle, resulting in an even three-way split.</p>
        <p>''The city has the money to do it,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a City Hall news conference. He said the Mets had been told of the proposed financial formula more than a year ago.</p>
        <p>The mayor made his comments in response to a report that the owners of the Mets, long thought to favor construction of a new Ebbets Field-style ballpark, were now leaning toward renovating Shea, a far less expensive option.</p>
        <p>''That is a possibility,'' said Fred Wilpon, the co-owner of the Mets, who is spearheading the team's negotiations with City Hall. But when asked last night if he had given up on the prospect of a new Mets stadium, he said, ''Absolutely not.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' trepidation over new construction was more apparent yesterday in a report by The Associated Press, which quoted the Mets' other owner, Nelson Doubleday, as saying Shea Stadium ''can be refurbished and made up to date.'' He added, ''I don't see a great deal of taxpayer money to build the New York Mets a stadium.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has already pushed through new stadiums for single-A minor-league franchises of the Yankees and the Mets, paid for entirely by the city and under construction on Staten Island and at Coney Island.</p>
        <p>The impact on the Mets of Mr. Giuliani's public bargaining posture remained unclear yesterday.</p>
        <p>But the idea may have come as a surprise to both the Yankees' principal owner, George M. Steinbrenner 3rd, and Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>''This is the first I've heard'' of the mayor's proposal, said Charles Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation and Governor Pataki's chief adviser on economic development projects. But he said in an interview that the state was prepared to pay for road repairs and other infrastructure improvements necessary for new or renovated New York City stadiums, and that the mayor's formula might provide a reasonable division of costs.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Yankees declined last night to comment on the mayor's financing proposal.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Giuliani has for years promoted the idea of a new domed stadium on the West Side of Manhattan, which he said could serve as a home for the Yankees, the proposal has taken a back seat in recent weeks to City Hall negotiations aimed at luring the Jets as anchor tenants in the mayor's grand West Side stadium proposal.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, asked if his three-way financing formula would be offered to the Jets, Mr. Giuliani said ways of paying for a football stadium ''haven't been discussed yet.''</p>
