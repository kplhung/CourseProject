        <p>No matter how many international tournaments the United States has won, Norway has always played the role of asterisk in the American domination of women's soccer.</p>
        <p>It is the one nation with a winning record against the United States, the one team with the same unyielding resolve and expectation of victory. Norway did not capitulate tonight when overtime of the Olympic gold medal match came in the most excruciating of ways, Tiffeny Milbrett heading a brilliant cross from Mia Hamm into the net half a minute from the end of regulation. The Norwegians grew angry, not discouraged.</p>
        <p>''I got mad,'' defender Gro Espeseth said. ''I said: 'No, we are going to win this. We don't want them to do this again.' It was our turn. We weren't going to lose.''</p>
        <p>The 3-2 Norwegian victory over the United States, before a crowd of 22,848 at Sydney Football Stadium, will be remembered as one of the greatest women's games ever played, wide open and full of wild swings, breathless creativity, stirring defense, rapturous victory and inconsolable defeat.</p>
        <p>The decisive play developed 12 minutes into sudden death, when midfielder Hege Riise sent a long, arcing pass into the penalty area. Joy Fawcett got her head on the ball but could not control it for the American defense. The ball ricocheted off the upper left arm of forward Dagny Mellgren and bounced free and unobstructed toward the goal. Mellgren reached it and pushed a shot from 14 yards past the diving American goalkeeper, Siri Mullinix, sending Norway into ecstatic celebration and leaving the Americans in stunned silence, hands on their hips, silver medals around their necks when they had expected gold.</p>
        <p>The outcome of the game will be widely debated because of the potential for a hand ball to be called on Mellgren's winning goal. The rules say that a violation occurs if a player touches the ball on purpose or gains an advantage from the contact.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know it was hitting me,'' Mellgren said. ''I didn't see it. I didn't do it on purpose.''</p>
        <p>Brandi Chastain, the American defender, said she was satisfied that, unlike the National Football League, international soccer did not rely on videotaped replays to confirm or contradict a referee's decision.</p>
        <p>''The referee is part of the game, for good calls and bad,'' Chastain said. ''I'd prefer her to make the call in that instant than to rely on videotape.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, Julie Foudy, the American captain, sought an explanation from Referee Sonia Denoncourt of Canada. The referee put up her hand and said, ''Don't do this to me, Jules,'' said Foudy, who added that Denoncourt thought the ball had hit Mellgren's chest.</p>
        <p>The referee did not speak to reporters, but the Americans did not challenge the call, remaining gracious in defeat, calling the loss shocking but not unfair.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to focus on that,'' Foudy said. ''I think we need to applaud Norway for a great game.''</p>
        <p>Norway has built a 15-13-2 overall record against the Americans, winning four and tying one of their eight matches this year. It was Norway that handed the Americans their most bitter defeat, a 1-0 loss in the semifinals of the 1995 Women's World Cup, infuriating the United States when Riise and her teammates crawled on their knees across the field in a celebration ritual called ''the train.''</p>
        <p>A year later, the United States defeated Norway in overtime of the 1996 Olympic semifinals. The Americans opened the Sydney Games with a 2-0 victory, dominating a Norwegian team that seemed slow and listless. Tonight, however, a rejuvenated Norway prevailed on tactical resourcefulness, fresher legs and more reliable goalkeeping.</p>
        <p>The Americans scored in the first five minutes when Hamm elbowed her way around the defender Goeril Kringen and crossed a pass to Milbrett, who chipped it into the net from six yards.</p>
        <p>''Oh, no, not again,'' Espeseth told herself in the Norwegian defense. ''Why should they win again and again and again?''</p>
        <p>She would not let them. A minute before halftime, Riise lifted a corner kick from the right side and Espeseth outjumped the American defender Kate Sobrero, flicking the ball with her head. Guarding the left goal post, Shannon MacMillan raised her left leg, but the ball deflected into the net for a 1-1 tie. A minute before halftime, the Americans had given a dormant team new life and purpose.</p>
        <p>''That was a momentum crusher,'' Foudy said.</p>
        <p>Norway had opened the game in a 4-4-2 alignment with four defenders, four midfielders and two forwards. After halftime, it switched to five midfielders and began to pressure the Americans, closing space that had been wide open. In the 78th minute, Mullinix rushed 12 yards off her line to punch away a long pass, but instead collided with Fawcett, knocking her off the ball. Ragnhild Gulbrandsen's header bounded into the empty net and put Norway up, 2-1.</p>
        <p>Roaming the penalty area had made Mullinix an assertive goalkeeper this year in replacement of an injured Briana Scurry, but it also made her a risky last line of defense. She did not do the one thing that is mandatory when she strayed from the goal mouth: get her hands on the ball. ''I don't think it was a lack of experience,'' Mullinix said. ''That's my style.''</p>
        <p>The Americans remained composed, and only 30 seconds before the end of regulation, Hamm floated a crossing pass from the right flank to the 5-foot-2 Milbrett, who outjumped a Norwegian defender and headed in the tying goal. Criticized because she did not score in the knockout round of the 1999 Women's World Cup, Hamm finished the Sydney Games with the clever, dependable, relentless play that is to be expected from someone with her reputation.</p>
        <p>''I just looked up to heaven and said, 'Thank you,' '' Hamm said of the tying goal. ''I didn't know what happened.''</p>
        <p>Norway might have folded at this point, but as it gathered before overtime, Espeseth said her teammates were telling one another: ''This is our Olympics. We're not going to lose.'' Mellgren had entered the game only 12 minutes earlier. While Hamm and Milbrett had been running up and down nonstop, the Norwegian forward had rested legs.</p>
        <p>''We knew the Americans would be tired at the end, and we had fresh legs to put in,'' Norway Coach Per-Mathias Hagmo said.</p>
        <p>Twelve minutes into the overtime, Mellgren ran onto Riise's long pass, lifted her arm slightly toward the ball, let it bounce and fired a shot toward Mullinix. The American goalkeeper lunged to her left and got a hand on the ball but could not stop it. Norway had won. Goalkeeping provided victory for the Americans at the 1999 Women's World Cup, but tonight it was not steady enough to prevent defeat.</p>
        <p>''We have enormous will on our team,'' Mellgren said. ''We are strong mentally and physically. We decided to win against every team. I knew that if we kept going, we'd score a goal.''</p>
        <p>After Mellgren's winning goal, Hamm squatted on the field and put her face in her hands. Several of her teammates stood there with disbelieving looks. Others hugged and cried in each other's arms. ''I was in shock until I got to the locker room,'' Hamm said.</p>
        <p>Having won a pair of World Cups and the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, the Americans had changed the way women's sports were viewed. They drew 90,000 fans to the Rose Bowl for the 1999 World Cup final, and 40 million television viewers in the United States. No longer could anyone say that people would not pay in large numbers to watch women play sports.</p>
        <p>A professional women's soccer league will start next April. The players are finally able to make a living at their sport. But the Americans had wanted this Olympic tournament as validation of their greatness, a confirmation that they could win a major tournament outside the United States, a final victory before many of the players considered retirement.</p>
        <p>''I wanted so badly to do it for this group,'' Foudy said. ''It's possibly our last time together. It's irreplaceable, this bond.''</p>
        <p>In the end, though, there were no excuses. Chastain, ever a student of the sport, said defeat, as bitter as it was, was tempered by the magnificence of tonight's game.</p>
        <p>''It's the greatest game I've ever been part of,'' she said.</p>
