        <p>The odds are you have never heard of the star of ''Lifegame,'' the piquant, oddly touching new offering from the ever-resourceful Improbable Theater. Certainly, I had never heard of one Nancy Rosenthal, who on the night I caught the show held the stage of the Jane Street Theater with a commanding, radiant centeredness. I would recommend that you go see the charismatic Ms. Rosenthal, a self-described ''stay-at-home Mom'' of 45, except that her run ended the night it began. The stars of ''Lifegame'' are stars for only two hours.</p>
        <p>This latest work from the young British troupe that turned Scotch tape into ectoplasm in ''70 Hill Lane,'' the real-life haunted-house drama that was their maiden outing in New York, is now turning instant biography into instant, multiform theater.

        <p>The odds are you have never heard of the star of ''Lifegame,'' the piquant, oddly touching new offering from the ever-resourceful Improbable Theater. Certainly, I had never heard of one Nancy Rosenthal, who on the night I caught the show held the stage of the Jane Street Theater with a commanding, radiant centeredness. I would recommend that you go see the charismatic Ms. Rosenthal, a self-described ''stay-at-home Mom'' of 45, except that her run ended the night it began. The stars of ''Lifegame'' are stars for only two hours.</p>
        <p>This latest work from the young British troupe that turned Scotch tape into ectoplasm in ''70 Hill Lane,'' the real-life haunted-house drama that was their maiden outing in New York, is now turning instant biography into instant, multiform theater. The show is based riskily on the classic premises that everyone has a story to tell and that no examined life is truly boring.</p>
        <p>Each evening, a preselected volunteer (not drawn from that night's audience) is brought onstage and asked basic biographical questions by a single, mercifully tactful interviewer (who changes nightly). This is conducted rather in the manner of a television talk show, though not of the confrontational sort. The volunteer's answers are quickly -- sometimes even simultaneously -- turned into vignettes by the company's seven-member ensemble. This is your life, indeed.</p>
        <p>''Lifegame,'' which was created by Keith Johnstone and has been previously seen in London and San Diego, sounds like the kind of performance that you would attend only at gunpoint and then spend staring at your shoes. After all, the potential for disaster, of both the humiliating and the boring varieties, is large. Anyway, haven't we had enough of ordinary people doing psychological (and sometimes literal) stripteases on daytime television?</p>
        <p>Yet there is a glowing gentleness about ''Lifegame,'' a curiosity coupled with respect, that keeps it a healthy distance from a tabloid sensibility. It is made clear from the beginning that the guests control the direction of the evening: they can provide and withhold information as they see fit. As the show progresses, the effect is less Jerry Springer than Federico Fellini -- that is, as in the later, warmer memory films of Fellini, like ''Amarcord,'' or its American cousin, Woody Allen's ''Radio Days.''</p>
        <p>As in those movies, basic recollections of childhood are given an exaggerated life that combines comic flourish with deep wistfulness. Ms. Rosenthal, for example, had to give only a few particulars of her child's eye view of her mother -- as a glamorous looking woman who served food in a Brooklyn school cafeteria -- for three ensemble members to assemble an immediate vision of boys lining up to have their plates filled by a ladle-wielding femme fatale. ''The boys were crazy about her,'' said Ms. Rosenthal, nodding at the scene before her.</p>
        <p>The most commonplace recollections are often the most inspirational for the seven-member company: Ms. Rosenthal's description of turning down a date in junior high school became a musical set piece with an impromptu ballad of teenage angst and an ice-skating puppet. A passing reference to a troubled love affair turned into a hilarious five-second portrait of the reckless boyfriend who fast became history. Extemporaneous music, from keyboard and sax, floated in counterpoint, providing the soundtrack that every life begs for.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it takes a fair amount of questioning to arrive at an incident the performers can ride to interpretive heights. A couple of vignettes died on the vine. Yet longeurs are few and usually overridden by the combined feelings of suspense and good will one feels for the people onstage.</p>
        <p>Each night, the visiting subject of ''Lifegame'' chooses an alter ego among the performers. Guests may also participate as actors if they choose. Ms. Rosenthal chose to and was remarkably effective at playing her own grandmother and a nun schoolteacher who sang the prepositions as a mnemonic device. She also recounted a most tangled tale of courtship with the man who would become her husband that left the others on stage open-mouthed and temporarily silenced.</p>
        <p>This was either lucky or unlucky for the troupe, depending on your point of view, since Ms. Rosenthal often upstaged the professionals without ever seeming to try. It is telling that the company appeared entirely comfortable with the situation, even shaping the material so the evening would end logically with the reappearance of the popular singing nun as embodied by Ms. Rosenthal.</p>
        <p>Indeed, what makes ''Lifegame'' so appealing is the clear sense that its performers are there not to show off their obvious talents but to provide a frame for others. It is as selfless-seeming a slice of show business as I have ever witnessed.</p>
        <p>The show is nearly impossible to review in any conventional way, since its tone and shape depend entirely upon its volunteer guest star. But from my single experience of ''Lifegame,'' I can attest that I was far more engrossed by the story of the protracted, conflicted romance of Ms. Rosenthal and her husband-to-be than I have ever been by chronicles of Bruce and Demi or Gwyneth and Ben.</p>
