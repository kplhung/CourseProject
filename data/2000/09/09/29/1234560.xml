        <p>After a year filled with setbacks, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced yesterday that it would sell its Clairol beauty care business and another unit that sells medical equipment so that it could focus more on the highly profitable business of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>In a meeting with analysts and investors, Charles A. Heimbold Jr., chairman of Bristol-Myers, said that after selling the two businesses, prescription drugs would make up 85 percent of the company's sales and 90 percent of its profits.</p>
        <p>''Our best days are still ahead of us,'' Mr. Heimbold told the investors, many of whom have been pressing the company to find ways to improve its bottom line.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heimbold said that the company was not sure how it would divest itself of the two businesses. He said the company might trade the units for another company's pharmaceutical business to avoid taxes on a sale.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers has long resisted pressure from investors to sell Clairol, which had $2.4 billion in sales last year, because the business was founded by the family of Bristol-Myers's former chairman, Richard L. Gelb. The medical equipment business, which is known as Zimmer Inc., sells hip replacements and other supplies. The business is based in Warsaw, Ind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heimbold said the company also planned to pursue more co-promotion agreements in which Bristol-Myers sales representatives help sell other companies' drugs. The company, he said, will also try to increase its sales in Japan, which is the world's second-largest market for prescription drugs. The United States is the largest.</p>
        <p>The stock price of Bristol-Myers has fallen this year after the company was forced to delay its plans for Vanlev, a promising new drug that it was counting on to replace sales of two blockbuster drugs that are losing their patent protection. Once a drug loses that protection, generic drugs can quickly eat into its sales.</p>
        <p>The company postponed its regulatory application for the new drug, Vanlev, a blood-pressure drug, in April after some patients developed severe facial swelling.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers has aggressively filed lawsuits against generic companies to try to keep them from selling a low-priced version of Taxol, a cancer drug that is the company's second-biggest seller. Those tactics recently prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether the company had violated any antitrust laws. The investigation is continuing. Ivax, a generic company, has said that it plans to soon begin selling generic Taxol, a drug that contributed $1.5 billion to Bristol-Myers revenues last year.</p>
        <p>Within months, the company will also lose its patent protection on Glucophage, a diabetes drug that had $1.3 billion in sales last year. And, Bristol-Myers's top seller, Pravachol, a cholesterol drug, has been losing market share this year to a Pfizer drug, Lipitor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heimbold said the company was planning to increase its earnings this year by 11 percent -- a rate that Wall Street is expecting. That rate will increase in the next two years, he said. By 2003, the company expects to be growing 15 percent or more.</p>
        <p>Bristol-Myers shares rose $2.52 yesterday, to $59.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 30, 2000, Saturday  An article in Business Day yesterday about plans by Bristol-Myers Squibb to sell some businesses and focus on prescription drugs referred incorrectly to an earnings projection made by Charles A. Heimbold Jr., the company's chairman, at a meeting with securities analysts and investors. He said the company's earnings per share would increase 14 percent this year, not 11 percent. The company expects earnings per share to increase 11 percent in 2001.</p>
