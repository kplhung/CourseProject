        <p>An abortion using mifepristone, or RU-486, takes place in three steps.</p>
        <p>First, in a doctor's office, a woman takes three pills of mifepristone, which blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone required to maintain a pregnancy. She will return to the  doctor's office 36 to 48 hours later to take two tablets of a second drug, misoprostol, a prostaglandin or hormonelike substance that will make her uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue.</p>

        <p>An abortion using mifepristone, or RU-486, takes place in three steps.</p>
        <p>First, in a doctor's office, a woman takes three pills of mifepristone, which blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone required to maintain a pregnancy. She will return to the  doctor's office 36 to 48 hours later to take two tablets of a second drug, misoprostol, a prostaglandin or hormonelike substance that will make her uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue.</p>
        <p>About 14 days after initiating the abortion the woman will return to the doctor to be sure that she is no longer pregnant and that no fetal tissue remains in her uterus.</p>
        <p>Studies show the drug combination causes bleeding and cramping that usually last 9 to 16 days but can continue for 30 days or more. About half the women also reported nausea and a quarter to a third said they experienced headaches, vomiting or diarrhea. These symptoms usually dissipated after three days.</p>
        <p>About 1 percent of the women who undergo this kind of abortion bleed severely, sometimes requiring blood transfusions and surgical abortions. The abortion is incomplete about 5 percent of the time, requiring that a woman have a surgical abortion to empty her uterus of fetal tissue.</p>
        <p>The pills fail completely in about 1 percent of the women. They remain pregnant and surgical abortions are urged because the pills can cause birth defects.</p>
        <p>While mifepristone is a new drug in the United States, the second drug, misoprostol, is not. It is sold by Searle, a division of the Pharmacia Corporation, under the name Cytotec, and is approved as a treatment for ulcers. Because doctors can legally prescribe any approved drug for any purpose, it does not require a separate approval by the health agency for use in abortions.</p>
        <p>Claudia Kovitz, a spokeswoman for Searle, said that the company did not test it for use in abortions and would not promote it for that application. Ms. Kovitz said that the drug carried a warning stating it was not to be used in pregnancy.</p>
        <p>The Food and Drug Administration placed several restrictions on the use of mifepristone. Women may only use the drug for abortions within the first seven weeks after their last menstrual period (a third of all abortions in the United States now take place within this time);  doctors providing the abortion pills must be able to accurately determine the duration of a pregnancy and to diagnose a tubal pregnancy, which cannot be terminated with the drugs; and doctors must also be able to perform a surgical abortion should one prove necessary or have another doctor available who can do so.</p>
        <p>In addition, doctors dispensing the drugs must report any pregnancies that are not terminated after women take the medications and must report any serious events, like hospitalizations and blood transfusions, to the drug's sponsor, the Population Council, which has agreed to study the drug after it goes on the market.</p>
        <p>Each woman receiving mifepristone must sign an agreement saying she has received and read a ''medication guide,'' which includes a description of mifepristone's effects, how to take it, the risks and side effects of a pill-induced abortion and a promise that she will return in two days to take misoprostol and will return again in two weeks to be sure that her abortion is complete.</p>
        <p>Also, the health agency said, mifepristone will be sold directly to doctors. The doctors or certain other health care workers, like physicians' assistants supervised by doctors, will administer the drug.</p>
