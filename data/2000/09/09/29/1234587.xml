        <p>After more than a year of trying to hang President Clinton around Vice President Al Gore's neck, Gov. George W. Bush took the opposite tack today, saying the main problem with Mr. Gore was that he was not enough like his boss.</p>
        <p>In a speech to workers at a manufacturing plant here, Mr. Bush tacitly praised Mr. Clinton's past calls for an end to ''big government'' and said Mr. Gore was not heeding them.</p>
        <p>Instead, the vice president had ''cast his lot with the old Democratic Party'' in proposing a new level of federal spending and regulation that Mr. Bush said would endanger the country's current prosperity.</p>
        <p>''The vice president was seated right behind Bill Clinton at the State of the Union when the president declared, 'The era of big government is over,' '' Mr. Bush said, referring to Mr. Clinton's address in January 1996. ''Apparently, the message never took.''</p>
        <p>''My opponent seemed interested in reinventing government,'' Mr. Bush said, alluding to one of Mr. Gore's signature phrases. ''Now he seems interested only in expanding it. For him, big government has never really been dead. It's simply been biding its time, waiting for its next chance.''</p>
        <p>Those comments made up some of the sharpened language that Mr. Bush unveiled today to make the case that electing Mr. Gore might mean a return to ''the old ways of tax and spend.''</p>
        <p>Pressing the point, Mr. Bush called on Mr. Gore to promise unequivocally that he would never raise the payroll taxes for Social Security to keep the entitlement program financially solvent. Mr. Bush has made that pledge.</p>
        <p>The references to Mr. Clinton revealed a fresh tactic in Mr. Bush's intrinsically difficult quest to persuade Americans that they should unseat an incumbent administration in a period of unparalleled prosperity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was essentially saying that electing Mr. Gore would not be like re-electing Mr. Clinton, because Mr. Gore was less protege than dissident.</p>
        <p>''He is proposing the largest increase in federal spending in 35 years, since the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The vice president's spending plan proposes three times more in new spending than Bill Clinton proposed in 1992. If the vice president gets elected, the era of big government being over is over. And so, too, I fear, could be our prosperity.''</p>
        <p>In casting Mr. Gore as financially profligate and trying to plant fears that he might raise taxes, Mr. Bush sounded much like his father did in 1988, when then-Vice President George Bush waged a successful campaign for the presidency against Michael S. Dukakis, then the governor of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not use the word ''liberal,'' which was the tag his father placed on Mr. Dukakis at the time. But that was clearly what the Texas governor meant. And what he intended was to persuade voters that prosperity was a potentially fragile thing and that Mr. Gore was not its surest protector but its direst threat, someone who would not use the projected federal surpluses in the right way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush began an effort to wrest  the issue of prosperity at least partly away from Mr. Gore this week when he warned that the vice president was not taking the necessary steps to end an ''education recession'' that imperiled the American economy down the line.</p>
        <p>Today, he warned that too much new government spending could have the same effect. He said that his own proposal for a sweeping tax cut of $1.3 trillion over 10 years was, in fact, ''an insurance policy against an economic slowdown or a recession.''</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, called Mr. Bush's assessments ''absolutely laughable.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hattaway acknowledged that Mr. Gore's 10-year budget plan called for higher expenditures in ''education, health care, Medicare and the environment.'' But he said Mr. Gore's proposal for an estimated $500 billion in tax cuts over 10 years -- less than half the size of Mr. Bush's -- made that spending affordable.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Hattaway said, Mr. Bush's budget ''wastes most of the surplus on a massive tax cut and keeps the nation in debt.''</p>
        <p>Asked about Mr. Bush's pledge not to raise payroll taxes for Social Security, Mr. Hattaway said, ''Did he say, 'Read my lips'? The last time a Bush made a silly pledge like that, he broke it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hattaway said Mr. Gore would not be making a similar vow, because the vice president had already outlined a plan for safeguarding Social Security that did not involve a tax increase.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush mentioned Mr. Clinton twice -- and twice flattered him in comparison with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Previously, Mr. Bush had loudly rued the possibility of ''four more years of Clinton-Gore'' and implied that the vice president was a participant in an administration that, in Mr. Bush's view, was guilty of serious ethical lapses, divisive partisanship and failed leadership.</p>
        <p>But today, Mr. Bush described Mr. Gore as an entirely different kind of politician from Mr. Clinton, one who had ''left the vital center of American politics'' and headed left, leaving behind a moderate group of Democrats that he championed.</p>
        <p>''He has claimed to invent many things,'' Mr. Bush said, referring to that organization, ''but he did help invent the Democratic Leadership Council.''</p>
        <p>IN HIS OWN WORDS: GEORGE W. BUSH</p>
        <p>Remarks yesterday in Green Bay, Wis., on Vice President Al Gore's spending proposals:</p>
        <p>''I'll treat people with respect. I trust them to know their own interests and chart their own course.</p>
        <p>My opponent once had some sympathy for these ideas. He has claimed to invent many things, but he did help invent the Democratic Leadership Council. Senator Lieberman is also a member of that council.</p>
        <p>This is an organization of more moderate Democrats who want to modernize Medicare and Social Security. They want to shrink the federal work force and control spending. They want to use market-oriented ideas to help people in education and in health care. I don't always agree with this group, and they certainly don't always agree with me. But they are leaders, and the kind of leaders I will work with should I become the president.</p>
        <p>Vice President Gore has cast his lot with the old Democratic Party. His promises throw the budget out of balance. He offers a big federal spending program to every -- to nearly every -- single voting bloc in America. He expands entitlements without reforms to sustain them. And when others, Republican or Democrat, propose needed reforms in Social Security or Medicare or education, he opposes them vigorously, and he attacks them. Just when progress on important issues seemed within reach, my opponent has left the vital center of American politics.''</p>
