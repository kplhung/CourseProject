        <p>Shares of Freeserve, the leading provider of Internet access in Britain, fell 3 percent to 235 pence, or about $3.31, after it said first-quarter losses had nearly doubled to $:15.5 million, or about $19 million, as spending on advertising and new services increased. Revenue grew more than threefold to $:14.6 million, and the number of registered users grew to 2 million, compared with 1.4 million a year ago. Freeserve, which is 80 percent owned by Dixons, the British consumer electronics retailer, has been unsuccessful in efforts to find a buyer even as other Internet service providers have rushed to consolidate. Tiscali of Italy and T-Online International of Germany, which have made acquisitions to expand and cut costs, now have more than six  million users each. Freeserve also is facing stiff competition from the American Internet companies Yahoo and America Online.</p>
