        <p>European antitrust regulators plan to block Time Warner's joint venture with the British music conglomerate EMI Group but are much closer to approving Time Warner's $135 billion merger with America Online, people close to the talks said today.</p>
        <p>Mario Monti, the European antitrust commissioner, issued recommendations on both deals on Wednesday in a closed meeting with antitrust regulators from individual European countries, these people said.</p>
        <p>European officials said today that neither Mr. Monti nor most of the national competition regulators were satisfied with EMI's proposed concessions, which include selling a few of its small record labels as well as the logistical operations that physically distribute music products around Europe.</p>
        <p>European officials object that a deal between EMI and Time Warner would reduce the number of worldwide music distributors to four from five, and they are pushing for divestitures that the companies are loath to offer.</p>
        <p>But they are increasingly comfortable with Time Warner's acquisition by America Online, especially if Time Warner abandons the EMI venture. That, European officials say, would reduce anxieties that America Online could use its new power in the music business to cement its dominance in online services.</p>
        <p>One national regulator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the America Online merger could win approval fairly easily if Time Warner either makes big new concessions on EMI or abandons the deal altogether.</p>
        <p>''If the problems with the EMI deal were resolved either way, then that would remove the major impediment'' to approval of the AOL merger, the official said.</p>
        <p>That view was echoed, at least implicitly, by German competition regulators. Ulf Boge, head of Germany's cartel office and a member of the advisory group that met on Wednesday with Mr. Monti, has publicly warned that the EMI deal would severely restrict competition in the music industry. By contrast, Mr. Boge has been silent about the Time Warner merger with America Online.</p>
        <p>Time Warner's spokesman in New York, Edward Adler, broadly acknowledged today that the company's prospects for approval of its deal with AOL looked good while those for the EMI deal were more problematic.</p>
        <p>Regarding America Online, Mr. Adler said that discussions with the European Commission were ''nearing an end''' and that ''we are confident they will be concluded successfully.'' But regarding EMI, Mr. Adler said only that ''the process is continuing and is constructive.'' The United States Federal Trade Commission is also reviewing the EMI deal, but it has not issued an opinion yet.</p>
        <p>Even though both Time Warner and America Online are United States companies, the European Commission has the right to block their proposed merger because the companies conduct more than 250 million euros a year of business in European Union countries.</p>
        <p>If the European Commission does approve the AOL-Time Warner combination, the deal still faces tough scrutiny from regulators at two federal agencies in the United States.</p>
        <p>Officials at the F.T.C. have hinted that they would move to block the deal unless the companies agree to a broad range of rules intended to foster competition, including opening Time Warner's high-speed Internet cable lines to rival Internet service providers on nondiscriminatory terms.</p>
        <p>Lawyers at the F.T.C. have also been examining whether the proposed merger would lead to AOL's moving away from using high-speed telephone lines, as one company memorandum suggested. America Online executives have denied that would be part of their strategy, but the commission is exploring whether to impose conditions that would require AOL, the world's largest Internet service provider, to continue to make use of high-speed telephone lines as well as Time Warner's cable network.</p>
        <p>At the Federal Communications Commission, officials announced today that they had begun a proceeding to determine whether to issue industrywide rules to force all high-speed Internet companies to open their lines to rival service providers on equal terms.</p>
        <p>Officials said that the commission's decision to invite comments from the industry over the so-called open access rules had been prompted by conflicting court opinions on the subject and did not necessarily mean that new rules would be issued.</p>
        <p>The officials also said that final decisions about whether to impose new rules would not be made by the F.C.C. until sometime next year. By then, the agency is likely to have several new commissioners and possibly a different chairman, making it impossible to predict whether the agency intends to take action.</p>
        <p>The officials emphasized that the decision to invite comments about possible new rules had no effect on the review of the proposed merger of America Online and Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Executives of those companies have said that they will volunteer to keep their cable systems open to rivals, but that it would be unfair for the government to impose such conditions on them without also imposing them on other cable companies, like AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>Under its rules, the European Commission must decide on the EMI deal by Oct. 18 and on the America Online merger by Oct. 24. But both the companies and their opponents have already submitted their comments and proposed compromises, and European officials are widely expected to reach a decision much sooner than the official deadlines.</p>
        <p>Time Warner and EMI executives said that they had not given up hope of winning approval for their deal, but the difficulties will be hard to overcome.</p>
        <p>Under the European Commission's rules, companies are supposed to offer their proposed ''remedies'' no later than one month before the deadline for a final decision. That deadline passed last week. And while there is room for bargaining, companies are not supposed to submit entirely new proposals.</p>
        <p>Even if the companies do propose new compromises, both Time Warner and EMI appear reluctant to give up major record labels to win approval.</p>
        <p>It was precisely the union of Warner Music's strength in the United States with EMI's base in Europe that made the joint venture attractive to them.</p>
        <p>Some industry rivals of Time Warner, notably at the Walt Disney Company, are still lobbying hard for Brussels to reject both the EMI and America Online deals.</p>
        <p>Disney officials have argued that they want guarantees of open access, without any discrimination in terms of pricing or technical conditions, for independent suppliers of entertainment and information as well as simply independent Internet service providers.</p>
