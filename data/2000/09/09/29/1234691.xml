        <p>Directed by Josh Evans  Not rated; 90 minutes</p>
        <p>''I should have been born black, man,'' complains the sensitive, stylishly alienated, amateur drug courier Paul (Josh Evans) to his African-American best friend D (the rap performer Sticky Fingaz), who, surprisingly, does not immediately knock him silly.</p>
        <p>Instead, in the great Hollywood tradition of black best friends, he takes a bullet for his white pal when a drug deal goes wrong, and bleeds to death in the parking lot of an Orange County strip mall.</p>
        <p>This makes Paul feel pretty bad, so he picks his way over the bodies and scoops up both the drugs and the money, fleeing with his bisexual porn-star girl friend Anne (Charis Michelsen) to a Los Angeles hotel room. High on the mysterious substance -- a new organic compound called ''blue,'' said to be ''more addictive than air'' -- they entertain themselves with half-hearted sex and vague philosophical musings until a vengeful enforcer (the British musician Goldie, who also wrote the film's score) shows up at the door.</p>
        <p>He wants to remove one of Paul's kidneys (currently the most popular leisure time activity in American film, with similar incidents occurring in ''Urbania'' and ''Urban Legends 2''), and he wants Anne to watch. Anne has other plans. She promptly rams the butt of her hand into the enforcer's face.</p>
        <p>''What you feel is your nose sticking deep in your brain,'' she tells him as she and Paul head for the door and the freedom of the open road.</p>
        <p>Now an officially designated Outlaw Couple on the Run, Paul and Anne are obliged to hop in a car and head for -- where else? -- Las Vegas, which turns out to be rather superficial and materialistic, almost as if it were some kind of metaphor for America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans, who is the writer and director of ''The Price of Air'' as well as its star, may not have been born black, but he was born the son of the producer Robert Evans and the actress Ali MacGraw. Though this is his third film as a director, following ''Inside the Goldmine'' and ''Glam,'' Mr. Evans doesn't seem ready to enter the family business quite yet. Shot on digital video and transferred to film, the picture is a smeary, dreary mess from start to finish.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, Mr. Evans's direction seems to consist of pointing the camera in the general direction of the actors and allowing them to prattle on as long as they like. There's hardly a hint of structure in the flow of the dialogue or the arrangement of the scenes. If the film makes any sense at all, it's largely because Mr. Evans is dealing with such familiar plot conventions that we can fill in the blanks for ourselves.</p>
        <p>So much alienated youth running around requires some extremely alienating adults, and Mr. Evans has supplied a couple of lulus. Michael Madsen plays the sinister drug kingpin Mr. Ball, who spends most of his time in his swimming pool barking orders into a cell phone. A former situation comedy star, Dick Van Patten, plays Mr. Ball's financial backer, an Orange County businessman so powerful that he can commit murder with impunity on the putting greens of his country club.</p>
        <p>''The Price of Air,'' which opens today at the Village East (Second Avenue at 12th Street, East Village), seems very proud of its suggestion that big business and organized crime are morally equivalent, which is all too typical of the movie's sophomoric sensibility.</p>
