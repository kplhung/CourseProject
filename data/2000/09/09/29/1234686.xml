        <p>USA Track and Field, under fire for allegedly suppressing positive drug tests, proposed today that its entire doping control program be handed over to an independent world body.</p>
        <p>Craig Masback, chief executive of the federation, suggested that the World Anti-Doping Agency handle all in-competition and out-of-competition tests for American athletes and investigate any positive cases.</p>
        <p>The federation also announced that it was forming a special commission to review its drug-testing procedures and address allegations that a number of positive cases had been covered up.</p>
        <p>Masback denied any cover-ups, insisting that the federation was bound by American confidentiality laws and rules preventing the disclosure of names of athletes who test positive until due process has run its course. He also said no United States athletes competing in the Sydney Games had failed drug tests. (AP)</p>
        <p>TRACK AND FIELD: WALK DOUBLE  Robert Korzeniowski of Poland became the first man in Olympic history to win both the 20-  and 50-kilometer walk races, capturing gold in the longer distance today in Sydney, Australia. He finished in 3 hours 42 minutes 21 seconds, ahead of Aigars Fadejevs of Latvia by 18 seconds. Joel Sanchez of Mexico won the bronze.</p>
        <p>Korzeniowski won the 20-kilometer title a week ago after Bernardo Segura of Mexico crossed the line first, but was disqualified for failing to maintain continuous contact with the ground.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, an appeal by Romania's world hammer champion, Mihaela Melinte, requesting that she be allowed to compete in today's final was rejected last night. Officials said Melinte, who was told she could not throw just minutes before Wednesday's qualifying competition, took her case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport last night.</p>
        <p>Melinte tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone in Milan, Italy, on June 7. (Reuters)</p>
        <p>DIVING: CHINESE LEAD  Tian Liang and Hu Jia ranked 1-2 after the preliminaries of men's 10-meter platform today, setting up China to capture its record fifth diving gold medal of the Games.</p>
        <p>The Americans David Pichler and Mark Ruiz also qualified for the 18-man evening semifinal. The last diving medals of this Olympics will be determined in the finals tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>WRESTLING: AMERICANS ADVANCE  Sammie Henson, a former world champion, pulled off another comeback today to reach the semifinals at 119 pounds.</p>
        <p>All four Americans wrestling in today's first session were winners. Brandon Slay, who upset the four-time world champion Bouvaissa Saitiev of Russia yesterday, reached the semifinals at 167 1/2 pounds. Lincoln McIlravy at 152 pounds and the heavyweight Kerry McCoy won their first matches.(AP)</p>
        <p>SAILING: RACES POSTPONED  The medal-deciding races in the Europe and Laser dinghy classes were postponed minutes before the start today because of shifting winds. (Reuters)</p>
        <p>CANOE-KAYAK: ANOTHER CONTROVERSY  Petar Merkov, a Bulgarian kayaker who reportedly tested positive for a diuretic this year, advanced to the final of the men's 500-meter kayak today after the International Canoeing Federation refused to stop him from competing. (Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>I.O.C.: 8 ATHLETES JOIN  Eight active athletes were voted onto the International Olympic Committee's athletes' commission today, a prelude to their expected election to the committee.</p>
        <p>Forty-four athletes were nominated for the commission by their national Olympic committees, and 5,216 athletes voted from Sept. 16 to 27. The eight are: Sergei Bubka of Ukraine, the pole vaulter; the swimmers Aleksandr Popov of Russia and Susie O'Neill of Australia; Robert Ctvrtlik of the United States, a volleyball player; Jan Zelezny of the Czech Republic, a javelin thrower; Charmaine Crooks of Canada, a sprinter; Roland Baar of Germany, a rower; and Manuel Estiarte of Spain, a water polo player.</p>
