        <p>We first see Diana Guzman, the heroine of ''Girlfight,'' Karyn Kusama's sweet and fierce directorial debut, through a crowd of teenagers stampeding through the halls of a Brooklyn high school. She's leaning against a locker, head down, her black hair in cornrows along her scalp. Then she slowly raises her eyes, throwing out a glower as fearsome as Robert De Niro's in ''Raging Bull.'' It's a riveting, iconic moment, a glimpse into the soul of an angry, proud young woman. The shot also introduces a powerful, extraordinarily gifted young actress: Michelle Rodriguez. Remember the name.</p>
        <p>The first few scenes, which Ms. Kusama directs with fluid efficiency, establish the basic facts of Diana's temperament and her circumstances.

        <p>We first see Diana Guzman, the heroine of ''Girlfight,'' Karyn Kusama's sweet and fierce directorial debut, through a crowd of teenagers stampeding through the halls of a Brooklyn high school. She's leaning against a locker, head down, her black hair in cornrows along her scalp. Then she slowly raises her eyes, throwing out a glower as fearsome as Robert De Niro's in ''Raging Bull.'' It's a riveting, iconic moment, a glimpse into the soul of an angry, proud young woman. The shot also introduces a powerful, extraordinarily gifted young actress: Michelle Rodriguez. Remember the name.</p>
        <p>The first few scenes, which Ms. Kusama directs with fluid efficiency, establish the basic facts of Diana's temperament and her circumstances. She moves through life in a coiled sulk, ready at the slightest provocation to explode out of quiet truculence into rage -- the kind of adolescent that education professionals would label ''at risk.'' Actually, when Diana's mad, everyone else is at risk, from a stuck-up schoolmate to her own father.</p>
        <p>She's quick with her fists, but her most potent weapon is that stare. When Diana shows up at a rundown gym hoping to sign up for boxing lessons, one of the trainers sneeringly asks if aerobics wouldn't be more suitable. She turns her head slowly and freezes him with a look of pure contempt. ''Was I talking to you?'' she asks. Not many 18-year-old girls can make a grown man cower like a beaten dog.</p>
        <p>Diana lives in the Red Hook housing projects with her father, Sandro (Paul Calderon), and her younger brother, Tiny (Ray Santiago), who dreams of becoming an artist. To Ms. Kusama's credit, she doesn't load the family down with melodrama -- at least not until the end of the movie, when a final confrontation between Sandro and Diana tips over into sensationalism.</p>
        <p>But there is a pervasive feeling of dread and disconnection in the scenes that take place around the table in the family's tiny kitchen. Sandro is sullen and a bully, and yet Mr. Calderon's performance is also full of sorrow and unexpressed tenderness. Sandro is crushing his daughter -- forbidding her to box, walking out in disgust when he sees her in the ring -- but also trying, clumsily, to protect her. The movie's main locus of unresolved pain is in this relationship, between two people who are so much alike and yet fail utterly to reach each other.</p>
        <p>Even though it deals with the new phenomenon of women who box, ''Girlfight'' follows a fairly standard sports melodrama story line: we see a lot of hard training, a few triumphs and setbacks, all on the way to the big fight at the end. Diana is grudgingly admitted to the macho subculture of amateur boxing. Her big break comes when the state declares that amateur bouts and tournaments must henceforth include men and women fighting each other. Although in real life such mixed-gender boxing is extremely rare -- and frowned upon by most authorities, including the International Female Boxers Association -- the movie does not make it seem outlandish.</p>
        <p>The plot takes some unexpected -- if occasionally contrived -- turns. At the gym, Diana meets Adrian (boxing-movie fans will note that this was also the name of the love interest in the ''Rocky'' movies), a handsome young featherweight played by Santiago Douglas. Their friendship soon edges toward a very tender, believable romance (featuring a wonderful first kiss), and before you know it, they're scheduled to meet in the ring, an event foreshadowed by an early sparring session, in which Diana rocks Adrian with a right cross to the temple and then says, for the first time, ''I love you.'' Is this all a bit much? Maybe, but by the time the first bell rings, you'll be in no mood to complain.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kusama's unassuming script and Patrick Cady's fine, gritty cinematography keep ''Girlfight'' anchored in unpretentious realism. Diana and her young male sparring partners and opponents look good, but not too good; they flail with the energy of the youthful amateurs they're meant to be.</p>
        <p>''Girlfight'' sparkles with nice, small touches: a splendidly punch-drunk rendition of ''The Star-Spangled Banner''; the inspirational slogans, hand-lettered on cardboard, hung on the walls of the gym; the sly banter between the wizened trainers.</p>
        <p>The supporting cast brings dimension to Diana's world. Mr. Calderon's eyes and face suggest, more than the few lines he speaks, the suffering behind his brutality. Mr. Douglas brings warmth to his scenes with Ms. Rodriguez, and Jaime Tirelli -- as her gruff, kindly trainer, Hector --  has the loose good humor that this role, hardly the freshest in the fight-picture repertory, requires.</p>
        <p>But the movie belongs to Ms. Rodriguez. With her slightly crooked nose and her glum, sensual mouth, she looks a little like Marlon Brando in his smoldering prime, and she has some of his slow, intense physicality. She doesn't so much transcend gender as redefine it.</p>
        <p>In recent years, athletes like Venus Williams, Rebecca Lobo and Marion Jones have given the world a new, intoxicating image of female beauty rooted in power and confidence as well as grace. Ms. Rodriguez is the first movie star -- and she is, without question, a movie star -- to embody this new ideal. Allow me one lame sports metaphor (after all, this is a review of a boxing movie): she'll knock you out.</p>
        <p>''Girlfight'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and some violent scenes.</p>
        <p>GIRLFIGHT  Written and directed by Karyn Kusama; director of photography, Patrick Cady; edited by Plummy Tucker; music by Theodore Shapiro; production designer, Stephen Beatrice; produced by Sarah Green, Martha Griffin and Maggie Renzi; released by Screen Gems.
