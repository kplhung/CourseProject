        <p>There are a few big-name artists in the Gere collection of landscape oil sketches -- Bocklin, Boldini, Corot, Degas, Leighton and Salvator Rosa -- but they are not the rule.

        <p>There are a few big-name artists in the Gere collection of landscape oil sketches -- Bocklin, Boldini, Corot, Degas, Leighton and Salvator Rosa -- but they are not the rule. Most of these small landscapes, notable for their freshness and immediacy, were done in Italy by all but unknown 17th, 18th and 19th-century talents: Edouard Bertin, Jean-Joseph-Xavier Bildaud, Heinrich Burkel, Giovanni Costa, Louis Gauffier, Josephus Augustus Knip, George Heming Mason, Achille-Etna Michallon and Goffredo Wals, to name a few.</p>
        <p>But these artists did something quite offbeat from the usual practice of their day: they departed from studio work to paint outdoors, registering transient moments of light and atmosphere by sketching quickly in oil directly from nature. The seamed face of a rock, the rush of water through a valley, the play of sunlight on a ruin are among the motifs they used to train hand and eye for more ambitious compositions.</p>
        <p>Although it had been assumed for generations that this ''plein air'' (open air) approach began, more or less, with the Impressionists in the late 19th century, scholars have now determined that the practice goes back to the 17th, and that by the beginning of the 19th century it had been widely adopted. For some years connoisseurs have been tracking down the small landscape oils that resulted, long not considered important enough to be shown with an artist's more finished efforts.</p>
        <p>A pioneering scholar-collector in this field was John Gere (1921-1995), former keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum. Starting in 1950 with an 1870's view of the Crystal Palace in London by William White Warren, an English painter of coastal scenes, he went on in 1954 to acquire ''The Grotto of Posillipo'' (1782) by an obscure Welshman named Thomas Jones, then beginning to attract attention from a small group of cognoscenti.</p>
        <p>The grotto, the ruins of a tunnel built by the Romans to link Naples with nearby Pozzuoli, was an engineering feat and the site of Virgil's tomb. Jones, whose work today is considered among the great examples of the plein-air oil sketch, used the structure, standing against a blue sky with cloud adornments, to study the melting effects of sunlight on the rock face in contrast with the deep blackness of the tunnel opening and that of the tomb entrance.</p>
        <p>As John Gere's widow and collaborator, Charlotte Gere (also an art historian), tells it in the catalog for ''A Brush With Nature: The Gere Collection of Landscape Oil Sketches'' at the Frick Collection, by the time Gere got on to Jones he was aware that these small ''snapshot'' landscape glimpses were ''paintings of a unique kind'' that deserved study as a separate entity and that the best way to study them was to collect them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gere recalls that shortly after meeting her husband-to-be she sought his advice on purchasing a  painting by Jones, on sale in a nearby shop for $:5. Without a word, Gere sprang from his desk and dashed to the shop, where he bought the painting for himself before she trailed in behind him. He later justified his action, Charlotte Gere writes, on the ground that collectors must be ruthless.</p>
        <p>Today the still-growing Gere collection consists of more than 80 works. Sixty-eight of them are on public view for the first time in this show, organized by Christopher Riopelle, curator of 19th-century painting at the National Gallery in London and coordinated for the Frick by Susan Grace Galassi, associate curator. Mainly painted in Italy, for centuries a mecca for the study of ancient and Renaissance masters as well as of atmospheric effects in the surrounding countryside, the sketches are by English, French, Italian, German, Belgian and Scandinavian artists.</p>
        <p>These days knowledge of the open-air sketching tradition in European landscape painting is so well established that it is difficult to recall the state of ignorance that existed in the 1950's, Ms. Gere writes. Acquiring these sketches then was not so much a matter of money as it is now but of searching in the dark.</p>
        <p>Gradually, a list of names to look for emerged, but the sketches, kept in the artist's studio and shown only to pupils and colleagues, were rarely signed. When a studio was broken up, the sketches usually found their way into flea markets or auction job lots. Even when finds came with names attached, they were often incorrect.</p>
        <p>In fact the naming game of matching artists to sketches is still going on. A current example is the very recent reassignment of ''Landscape With Cumulus Clouds'' (1824-29), long attributed to the Belgian painter Gilles-Francois Joseph Closson, but now given to one Andreas Schelfhout.</p>
        <p>A major figure in the development of the landscape sketch was Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (1750-1819). A teacher at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, he encouraged his students to paint informal views as a tune-up for more ambitious compositions. His 1800 treatise on perspective asserted that artists should devote only two hours to a sketch to capture specific effects of light. He also stressed that students should begin their studies with the sky, as tonality for the background.</p>
        <p>Interested in the minutest of effects, Valenciennes also recommended that painters study rushing water to understand movement, and attend closely to expressive tree trunks and their gnarled barks. Thanks to his influence, landscape painting acquired a new importance in France.</p>
        <p>Valenciennes is represented here by two works, ''Rome at Sunrise, From the Janiculum'' and the very crisply painted ''Cow Shed and Houses on the Palatine Hill'' (both from about 1780). Although the attribution of the first painting is still a little shaky, its panoramic view of distant Roman buildings has at least one Valenciennes characteristic: a subtly painted sky, dominated by a brooding black cloud bank, attended by more cheerful white and gray clouds and a glimpse of rosy dawn.</p>
        <p>The artist most represented in the collection is Frederic, Lord Leighton (1830-1896), well known for his tiresome, highly finished academic set pieces devoted to Renaissance and mythological themes. But the eight Leighton sketches in this show are fine examples of on-the-spot landscape treatments, notably his Corot-influenced ''Villa Malta, Rome'' (1860's). A brilliantly lighted view of the villa's asymmetrical tower, framed between two flourishing cypress trees in the foreground, the painting manages to convey the dry heat of the summer atmosphere that envelops it.</p>
        <p>Other striking exhibits include Thomas Kerrich's ''Distant View of Lowestoft From the South'' (around 1794), a seascape that very much resembles the work of the later American painter Fitz Hugh Lane; ''The Cascade at Tivoli'' (1824-29) by Closson, a dramatic, wonderfully detailed view (left unfinished around the edges), of falling water and contrasting foliage seen from the bottom of the gorge, and ''Wooded Bank With Figures'' (probably 1660's), attributed to Salvator Rosa, a dense, powerful depiction of trees and rocks that all but overwhelms three tiny outlawish-looking figures gesticulating in the foreground.</p>
        <p>Tune your eye to small when you look at this show and you'll find it a painterly treasure.</p>
        <p>''A Brush With Nature: The Gere Collection of Landscape Oil Sketches'' is at the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-0700, through Nov. 12.</p>
