        <p>The new head of the federal office that oversees research on people said yesterday that the system was flawed and would be revised to increase protection for human subjects.</p>
        <p>The official, Dr. Greg Koski, said stricter standards were needed because of the increasing number of experiments involving people.</p>
        <p>Dr. Koski, who became director of the Office of Human Research Protections this month, said he would ask universities to verify that scientists dealing with human subjects had formal training in ethics. He also said the review boards at the universities that approve human experiments must show that they have sufficient staff members and expertise to conduct proper ethical reviews of proposed experiments.</p>
        <p>In addition, he is asking the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences to devise a way to measure the performance of the scientists and boards.</p>
        <p>The moves come after several lapses in experiments that Dr. Koski said had shaken public confidence.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Jesse Gelsinger, 18, of Tucson, Ariz., died in a gene therapy experiment. And in the past two years, the federal government has shut down human research at eight major universities and hospitals for failure to abide by the nation's ethics rules, and has cited an additional 34 universities and hospitals for similar violations, according to an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        <p>Dr. Koski said he hoped that most of the changes could be adopted voluntarily by research centers. But if  they are not, he said, public sentiment will probably force Congress to mandate such standards.</p>
        <p>''We must move beyond the culture of compliance, to move to a culture of conscience and responsibility,'' he said at a news conference at his office in Washington.</p>
        <p>Until now, there has been no certification or accreditation of scientists or review boards to make sure they have formal ethics training. Federal officials do not even know how many  review boards there are in the United States, how many experiments are conducted on humans, or exactly what qualifications researchers and ethics reviewers have.</p>
        <p>Instead, under the system in place since the mid-1970's, researchers propose experiments on humans to an ethics review board, usually at their home university or hospital. That board reviews the proposal to assure that patients are not likely to be harmed and that the experiment complies with federal ethics rules. Federal oversight has been minimal.</p>
        <p>Dr. Koski said his office had already increased the number of investigators to six from two.</p>
        <p>For now, he said, the certification of scientists and supervisory boards by universities and medical centers will remain voluntary.</p>
        <p>But in the end, he said, his office has the option of suspending any  program that gets federal money to carry out research. Research carried out with private money is not covered by the system.</p>
        <p>Adil E. Shamoo, vice president of Citizens for Responsible Care and Research, a nonprofit group that has criticized government supervision of human experiments, said the moves  announced by Dr. Koski were ''good first steps.''</p>
        <p>''It will now depend on how they are carried out,'' Mr. Shamoo said, ''and whether they can address the weakest link in the system: that the  review boards themselves are employees of the institutions doing the  experiments. That conflict of interest is the central problem.''</p>
