        <p>If you had put it to a vote, polled the Olympic community, I suspect it would have been a landslide Slobodan Milosevic couldn't ignore. By the time it was announced today that Andreea Raducan wasn't getting her gold medal back, people just wished the little gymnast could wipe away the tears and go home happily to Romania to claim her $30,000 prize.</p>
        <p>And that was before Ion Tiriac apologized for English that is ''not Shakespearean,'' and played host to an Oprah-like panel that included the victimized Raducan and the Romanian gymnastic matriarch, Nadia Comaneci.</p>
        <p>''An aspirin is doping?'' said Tiriac, the whiskered president of the Romanian Olympic Committee. ''O.K., we are machines. We have to act like machines.''</p>
        <p>The onetime career guide for Boris Becker has always been an entertaining fellow, dramatic and bold with his pronunciations. Recently, back in more familiar territory, he reportedly said, on the eve of Marat Safin's blowout of Pete Sampras in the United States Open final: ''Sampras is out of gas. His tank is empty.''</p>
        <p>The Olympic sport of doping is apparently more difficult to handicap. With expectation growing that common sense and plain sentiment would prevail, the opposite occurred. Tiriac apparently believed he had successfully argued Raducan's case in a Wednesday hearing. But before the Romanians gave today's public defense, an unsmiling bureaucrat from the International Court of Arbitration for Sport read a statement that said, in effect: Too bad.</p>
        <p>And no questions from the news media would be answered either.</p>
        <p>It was a cold ending, no pun intended, leaving Raducan to seek comfort in the arms of Comaneci, star of the 1976 Montreal Games.</p>
        <p>Tiriac, meanwhile, lamented that the International Olympic Committee, besieged as it is with drug scandals here, ''didn't have the courage, in this case.''</p>
        <p>Actually, given the imagery of a weepy 4-foot-10, 82-pound pixie, the I.O.C. demonstrated an intrepid resolve that was sure to bring it additional scorn. Especially after its own inadvisable assertion that Raducan had done nothing wrong by accepting a cold pill from a team doctor that contained a banned substance, pseudoephedrine, before the all-around event swept by the Romanians last week.</p>
        <p>Unlikely as it seems that some competitive advantage was being sought, what qualifies the I.O.C. to know beyond a doubt what the Romanians were up to?</p>
        <p>The same day Tiriac was appealing the Raducan decision, the International Amateur Athletic Federation was scoffing at C. J. Hunter's explanation for why he tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone last July. It was pretty much the same sob story: he took a dietary supplement without knowing what was in it.</p>
        <p>If it had been some Romanian weight lifter in the position Raducan was in, would anyone have cared at all?</p>
        <p>All of these sports have their own peculiar cultures. Female gymnasts don't bulk up, for obvious reasons, but most of them look no more natural than the weight lifters. And that's usually the problem with these cases, how they are defended, adjudicated and publicly digested. Few of us know what the stimulants and drugs even do, and at what levels they become significant. No one ever knows for certain what the athletes were thinking, and sometimes, neither do they.</p>
        <p>Remember when Tom Gugliotta, the Phoenix Suns forward, had a seizure on the team bus last season? He went on television the following week and said he had taken a supplement that had been recommended by a friend. Why did he take it? He couldn't say. What was it supposed to do for him? He didn't know.</p>
        <p>Tiriac knew little about the particulars of this story, only that he ''couldn't look himself in the mirror'' if he hadn't fought to get Raducan's medal returned. After vowing to suspend any Romanian doper for life and claiming that everyone on the Olympic team was tested before the Games, he may wish to comb his hair with his eyes closed. Two Romanian weight lifters were thrown out last week and its world-record holder in the hammer throw, Mihaela Melinte, was pulled off the field Wednesday for failing an I.A.A.F. test last June.</p>
        <p>The track federation said that the Romanians were informed of the test two days earlier, and did nothing. You might say Tiriac's track record doesn't exactly support his outrage.</p>
        <p>Twenty-eight years ago, an American swimmer, 16-year-old Rick DeMont, was stripped of his 400-meter freestyle medal in Munich, after taking an asthma medication that contained a banned substance. DeMont wound up suing the United States Olympic Committee for breach of fiduciary duty. Considering the tragedy of those Olympics, the slaying of 11 Israeli athletes by terrorists, DeMont's case was not exactly cause for international dishonor.</p>
        <p>Nor is this one, no matter how frail and sad-eyed the tiny gymnast looked, sitting with her hands folded today, as she explained, ''I've done nothing wrong.'' It's entirely possible she didn't, but then, who can definitively say that Hunter willfully took the steroids he is accused of taking?</p>
        <p>Tiriac's little show today came off no less contrived than Hunter's. He said that Raducan, who turns 17 on Saturday, would get her $30,000 prize. The Romanian who backed into the gold, Simona Amanar, said she was accepting the medal because ''it belongs to Romania.''</p>
        <p>''The winner that day was Andreea, not me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Then Amanar should give Raducan back the medal when they get home, and leave it at that. As Tom Hanks might say, there's no crying in the uneven parallel bars.</p>
