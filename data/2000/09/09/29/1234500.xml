        <p>A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend.

        <p>''AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If only a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more, not less, remarkable, for having as little to do with sex as it does, and almost everything to do with painting. The works, many of them,  anyway, have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays,  9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>

        <p>''AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7).

        <p>* ''ART AND THE EMPIRE CITY: NEW YORK, 1825-1861,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). The point is that during the antebellum years New York began to become, well, New York, America's megalopolis and an international crossroads. The great metaphor was the plan to grid Manhattan: unsentimental, open-ended, utilitarian and democratic, it created the blank sheet on which the city could draw its future. Amusing, gigantic, only marginally an art exhibition, the show is really an ostentatious illustrated history lesson via hundreds of pieces of old crockery, etchings, paintings, rosewood fires creens, daguerreotypes and mother-of-pearl folding fans. Custom-made for our own acquisitive age, the exhibition is probably the only occasion on which a 19th-century brown ceramic water cooler and a six-sided pitcher with pictures of the presidential candidate William Henry Harrison have been presented as if they were the treasures of Pharaoh's palace in ''The Ten Commandments.'' Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''THE CHINESE PAINTER AS POET,'' China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181 (through Dec. 10.) In China, painting, poetry and calligraphy were the dream team of art: the ''three perfections,'' they were called. Any truly evolved person was adept at each, and discussion about any of them was framed in the same terms: rhythm, touch, tone, spiritual energy. This eloquent exhibition examines the three-way partnership through some four dozen paintings, several of them of the first rank, ranging in date from the Song dynasty (960-1279) through the 20th century. In many cases, the artist has inscribed his own poem on the surface of his painting in what amounts to a virtuoso, multimedia solo performance. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays and Thursdays, to 8 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 5 p.m. Admission: $3; $2, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with hand-written words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an ice-breaking introduction to an art that can all too easily seem, to non-Chinese speakers, unapproachable. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''HIP-HOP NATION: ROOTS, RHYMES AND RAGE,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Dec. 31). The complex cultural amalgam of music, poetry, break-dancing, art and fashion that is hip-hop poses a serious challenge to any art museum, but with the proper resources and curatorial expertise, it could have been done. Instead, this show offers a partial outline of hip-hop history, conveyed by photographs, posters, magazine and album covers, memorabilia and monotonous expanses of clothes that make the show nearly indistinguishable from the gift shop. Garnished with graffiti art, it bypasses a slew of other, equally interesting connections to contemporary art. Because the show omits music videos, it manages to be virtually devoid of the sounds, words and moving bodies that are the essence of hip-hop. The results are a cross between a mall and a mausoleum. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE OPULENT EYE OF ALEXANDER GIRARD,'' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400 (through March 18). The first comprehensive look at the multifaceted work of the architect and designer. Girard's contribution to contemporary design was a free approach that incorporated all sorts of visual stimuli, from Italian stage sets to Mexican folk art to motifs from modern technology, making exuberant use of color, pattern, texture and ornament. The exhibition displays -- in photographs, models and objects -- his fabrics, graphics, interiors, furniture, tableware, radio cabinets and much else. A whole room is devoted to the more than 300 fabric and wallpaper designs he did for the Herman Miller Furniture Company from the 1950's to the early 1970's, with fresh patterns and colors that pushed the envelope of middle-class taste. While Girard may not have been a heavyweight in American design, he was one of its liveliest figures. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays, to 9 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $8; $3, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>''PIERRE ET GILLES,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Jan. 7). No history of postmodern photography, fashion photography, celebrity portraiture, record album covers or the high-brow beefcake tradition would be complete without the work of the French photo team known as Pierre et Gilles, who have collaborated on over-the-top, tightly styled, hand-finished photographs since 1976 and become wildly famous in Europe in the process. In their first American museum retrospective, their work feels more than a little embalmed, existing behind a not-so-invisible shield of artistic conservatism. Certain images come to life as art objects -- most notably, one of a beautiful young sailor up to his chest in water with an iridescent night sky behind him -- but they are few and far between. Hours: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; $3, students, artists and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>''IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER,'' Kaikodo, 164 East 64th Street, (212) 223-0121 (through Oct. 21). Kaikodo's sales exhibitions are always a treat, and the sheer number of Chinese and Japanese paintings in this one is a major lure. These days, New Yorkers rarely get to see material in this quantity and variety outside museums. Highlights include an album painting of a flower attributed to the 13th-century artist Qian Xuan (it's very fragile, so you have to ask to see it); a 17th-century calligraphic scroll by the fractious Fu Shan; and a witty four-panel portrait of a family of gibbons, gold-medal acrobats all. Devotees of ceramics and textiles will also find much to admire (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''PORTRAITS OF LEO,'' Leo Castelli, 59 East 79th Street, (212) 249-4470 (through Oct. 7). This tasteful memorial show presents an assortment of affectionate portraits by artists who were supported and promoted by the gallery's founder, Leo Castelli, who died a year ago. It includes a candy-colored picture by Andy Warhol; a small, rumpled photograph of the dealer in a halo of light by Mike and Doug Starn; an amusingly kitschy ceramic head by Meyer Vaisman; the dealer's name spelled in green neon by Bruce Nauman; his ghostly image seen through a jigsaw puzzle screen by Jasper Johns; and an Abstract Expressionist likeness made by Elaine de Kooning in 1954 (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>RAVEN SCHLOSSBERG, James Graham &amp; Sons, 1014 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 535-5767 (through Oct. 7). This young,  New York-based painter mixes a lot of different systems on supports of patterned vinyl: calligraphic brushwork; dribbled or sprayed paint; collaged bits of old advertising, pornography and sappy pictures of children; and the talismanic, abstracted image of a clown, multiplied so that it seems to vibrate through space. It all adds up to work of glittery and jittery dissonance that seems at this point more promising than fully resolved (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ACHARYA VYAKUL, Lawrence Markey Gallery, 42 East 76th Street, (212) 517-9892 (through Oct. 7). Using materials ranging from cow's urine to flowers, these small, simple but highly charged watercolors are done in a ''tantra-folk'' style that melds mystical Hindu-Buddhist images with popular art. They range from enchanting monsterlike figures to an explosion of marks, probably done by fingerprints, that suggests a floral spray. Made by an instinctive but untrained artist (1930-2000) who was born and died in India, they radiate an infectious energy (Glueck).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>WILL BARNET, ''Works on Paper,'' Tibor de Nagy, 724 Fifth Avenue, (212) 262-5050 (through Oct. 14). Mr. Barnet is known today for his illustrative, poetically classicizing figurative paintings. This survey of drawings over seven decades shows that the artist, who was born in 1911, has tried his always adept if rarely original hand at most of the major 20th-century styles, from Social Realism to Cubism to flattened and simplified 50's-style abstraction. Some drawings of children, penciled with exacting, curvy lines in the 1940's, are particularly affecting (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* RINEKE DIJKSTRA, Marian Goodman Gallery, 24 West 57th Street, (212) 977-7160 (through Oct. 28). This Dutch artist's solo debut in the United States includes a video (much seen elsewhere) of dancing teenagers in European clubs and a series of photographs she has been taking since 1997 of children in parks. In the video the kids preen touchingly. The photographs, color pictures along the lines of Thomas Struth's but more casual and less chilly, are heroic portraits, acutely sympathetic (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''AN INTIMATE WORLD,'' China 2000 Fine Art, 5 East 57th Street, (212) 588-1198 (through Oct. 7). China 2000 has long specialized in evoking the rarefied world of the Chinese scholar-artist in a gallery context, and it does so with particular success in this beautifully installed selection of small-scale pieces. They include paintings on paper fans (a radiant scene of a mountaintop pavilion by the 17th-century artist Zheng Zhong, a 1920's painting of wisteria by Qi Baishi) and exquisite table top objects. The visual standout is a brush holder carved from a single piece of bamboo, with patterns of concentric rings that produce an off-kilter, slumped-cake effect (Cotter).</p>
        <p>ROBERT POLIDORI, Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999 (through Oct. 14). In its visual sumptuousness and oblique sociology, Mr. Polidori's architectural photography calls to mind photographers like Andreas Gursky or Thomas Struth. His images of ruined palatial interiors in Palm Springs or Havana are cinematically gripping; his picture of a room in Beirut with a bullet-pocked yellow wall and blue sky showing through another blown-out wall is like a terrible but beautiful dream (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>''PARADISE NOW: PICTURING THE GENETIC REVOLUTION,'' Exit Art, 548 Broadway, near Prince Street, (212) 966-7748 (through Oct. 28). ''We are at a threshold,'' declares the text panel at the start of this show. And we are, you know. Never mind that most of the art isn't great, because with more and more artists tapping into science, something big is bound to happen soon. Think of this as a preliminary report. The works span a decade and run the gamut from paintings and sculptures to the collecting of sperm and the breeding of very tiny exotic frogs. The artists fret predictably about tampering with Mother Nature and stress identity politics, also predictably, but the spirit of the show, an intangible, tips the scales in a positive direction. Scientists may be doing the crucial research, but artists are going to have to help us make sense of it all, the progress of humanity depending historically on a tandem of science and culture (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>RICHARD MISRACH, ''Skies,'' Curt Marcus Gallery, 578 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 226-3200 (through Oct. 14). You might mistake Mr. Misrach's enormous color photographs of nothing but skies shot at various times and in various desert locations for extremely subtle Color Field paintings. Fading from pale yellow to deep purple, or from smoldering orange to velvety blue, the 6-by-7 1/2-foot prints are at once romantic celestial visions and materialist essays on the modulation of color and tone. They occupy the gallery with Rothkoesque gravitas (Johnson).</p>
        <p>JEFFREY SALDINGER, CRG Art, 93 Grand Street, (212) 966-4360 (through Oct. 7). Mr. Saldinger paints a compelling theater of the self. In each of the nine self-portraits that make up the main body of his third solo exhibition, the artist adopts a dramatically exaggerated expression. He purses his lips, furrows his brow, looks angry, quizzical, amazed. In contrast to these theatrics, the painting may seem formally restrained; close examination, however, reveals it to be rich in sensuous complexity (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SELECTIONS FALL 2000,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through Oct. 14). The center's latest show of emerging artists focuses on schematic drawing. It includes Mary Lum's cutout and layered, painted line images of buildings; Lucas Monaco's crystalline transparent street maps; Oona Stern's cartoon wood floor; a mural by Geraldine Lau that resembles an air traffic map; architectural and topographical fragments finely inked and layered by Julie Mehretu; Miranda Maher's semitransparent stacks of utilitarian illustrations; Glenn Grafelman's smudgy fenestration drawings; and photographs of Grady Gerbracht that trace passing scenes on a bus window (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CORBAN WALKER, PaceWildenstein, 142 Greene Street, (212) 431-9224 (through Oct. 7). For his first New York solo exhibition, this Irish sculptor leaned more than 50 gleaming, 14-foot-long plate-glass planks at various angles along two of the gallery walls. Elsewhere, narrow horizontal mirrors and a viewing slot cut through a column at the diminutive sculptor's actual eye level -- four feet -- urge us to think about space, perception and cognition. But the effect of the whole is more elegantly decorative than rigorously formal or intellectual (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>XENOBIA BAILEY, ''Paradise Under Reconstruction in the Aesthetic of Funk -- Phase 2,'' Stefan Stux, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 352-1600 (through Oct. 14). Ms. Bailey takes the homely craft of crocheting colored yarn to eye-dazzling extremes. She creates expansive abstract compositions of overlapping circles that float in Kandinskyesque cosmic space and has knitted a fabulous walk-in tent in the form of a funky, totemic hat called ''Sistah Paradise Great Wall of Fire Revival Tent.'' The mystical exuberance and decorative opulence are irresistible (Johnson).</p>
        <p>SLATER BRADLEY, ''Charlatan,'' Team Gallery, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219 (through Oct. 7). This impressive show presents four brief video projections by an artist completely at ease with his medium, attuned to its various roles in contemporary life and willing to try something different every time he picks up the camera. Each of the works here has its own look, intensity and revelation. Together they form a mesmerizing meditation on obsession, death and the possibilities of art (Smith).</p>
        <p>MILES COOLIDGE, ''Mattawa,'' Casey Kaplan, 416 West 14th Street, (212) 645-7335 (through Oct. 7). Formalism and social realism converge in Mr. Coolidge's installation of 14 large color photographs of small white modular buildings. All shot from the same frontal, close-up perspective, the images convey a sunbaked, almost surrealistic bleakness. The structures are, in fact, storage containers used to house migrant workers in Mattawa, Wash., but there is no evidence of human habitation. One senses, rather, the baleful anonymity of big-time agribusiness (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ROB DE MAR, Clementine, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-5937 (through Oct. 7). Covered in colored flocking and supported by veiny metal armatures that connect grassy knolls, roadways, clouds, ponds and waterfalls, Mr. de Mar's toylike landscapes hover expansively from the gallery's walls. With comic nostalgia, they evoke pastoral dreams of parkway bliss. Small metal houses erected on tall poles and used by the artist for target practice are not so trippy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>WIJNANDA DEROO, ''Recent Photographs,'' Richard Anderson, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-0970 (through Oct. 14). This Dutch photographer roams the world, taking pictures of rooms without people. Her color prints are formally persuasive, but there is also a curious, searching quality to Ms. Deroo's project, as though she were a detective. A room in Curacao is carefully decorated in a funky retro style, with green-and-white striped walls and a shiny, biomorphic sofa; empty mobile-home rooms in upstate New York are grungy, desolate and vaguely menacing (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MARK INNERST, Paul Kasmin, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474 (through Oct. 7). In glossy, vertical paintings of New York City, with dark skyscrapers divided by slots of luminous sky, Mr. Innerst continues to explore a slightly ironic poetry of nostalgic beauty. Up close, the simplified realism melts into layers of watery glazes, enhancing tension between image and abstraction (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MATT MAGEE AND LEWIS DESOTO, Bill Maynes, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 741-3318 (through Oct. 7). Dense fields of small, carefully painted multicolored circles and dots cover the surfaces of Mr. Magee's paintings, to sensuously engaging and mildly trippy effect. In a darkened side gallery, Mr. deSoto's large and beautiful model ocean liner with illuminated portholes drifts slowly and mysteriously around the room, every so often producing its own fog bank (Johnson).</p>
        <p>SAMUEL MOCKBEE, ''The Architecture of the Black Warrior River,'' Max Protetch, 511 West 22nd Street, (212) 633-6999 (through Oct. 21). An architect and professor at Auburn University in Alabama, and a recent MacArthur Foundation grant winner, Mr. Mockbee supervises a program in which architecture students design and build houses for the poor in rural Alabama. Models, photographs and drawings show how inventively they have used salvaged and recycled materials, like old tires or hay bales, to produce buildings of real artistic distinction. Mr. Mockbee has made an inspirational case for the democratization of fine architecture (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ALICE NEEL, ''The Last Years,'' Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774 (through Oct. 14). Late portrait paintings and a fine, small drawing retrospective complement the Whitney's recent Neel retrospective. Some of the most arresting paintings are of children. The ghoulish-looking Jonathan in the arms of his father, Don Perlis, radiates demonic energy. The 15 drawings on paper, from the smoothly penciled ''Sam'' to the densely hatched ''Phil'' to the almost Minimalist ''Andy Warhol,'' argue persuasively for a more extensive show of drawings (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RAM RAHMAN, Admit One, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 463-0164 (through Oct. 7). Through busy documentary images from New Delhi, New York, Paris, Mexico and other places, this canny photographer projects a lively global perspective. Groups of obliquely related black-and-white pictures -- a statue of Queen Victoria juxtaposed with a row of Indian drag queens, for example -- turn out to be loaded with formal and pictorial complexities: compositional parallels, puns, odd shifts of scale, political ironies and sly sexual innuendo (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CHRISTINA S. RAY, ''Stills,'' Radio House Gallery, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 620-7630 (through Oct. 11). In Ms. Ray's complex and accomplished compositions, photographic fragments of objects committed to movement, like trains, roller coasters, doors and windows, are combined with more static elements and painted panels. They play off one another in a delicate counterpoint. The compositions are made more intricate by their construction: the fragments, mounted on Plexiglas, and the painted elements are placed side by side against the wall on wooden ledges, with clear or sandblasted glass strips in front of them (Glueck).</p>
        <p>ALAN SHIELDS, Paula Cooper, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105 (through Oct. 7) and Nicholas Davies, 23 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 243-6840 (through Oct. 14). Intricate constructions of chicken wire, dipped in paper pulp and brightly painted with watercolors, fill these two galleries with a playful, exotic festivity that is grounded in formalist materialism. Mr. Shields has long worked at mixing abstraction and decorative patterning; with his pop-out mandalas, suspended cages, space wheels and other Constructivist contraptions, he looks to be at the top of his game (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CYNTHIA SISSON, Audiello, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 675-9082 (through Oct. 14). For her first New York solo show, this young painter produced a kind of abstract eroticism. Flat, biomorphic shapes evoking the body are layered over diaphanous fields and entangled by carefully painted areas of floral or lacy patterning. With their delicately muted pastel colors and satiny surfaces, they seem an amalgam of Color Field painting, Indian miniature ornamentation and Victoria's Secret fantasy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>SHIRLEY TSE, Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372 (through Oct. 14). An impressive 80-foot blue polystyrene foam shelf wraps around the four sides of the gallery, its surface intricately sculptured by Ms. Tse into a series of abstract topographical designs that suggest miniature land- or cityscapes, ancient and futuristic. The shelf sections also resemble the cushioning used for packaging electronics. This Los Angeles artist's telescoping of space, time, illusion and form is exhilarating (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>KIM KIMBALL, ''Enthusiasm,'' Pierogi, 177 North Ninth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-2144 (through Oct. 9). The main event in this solo debut is a compendium of dozens of short videos made by Mr. Kimball, all filmed in his art-cluttered apartment. He lounges around in the nude, stretches his face through a distorting lens and plays the role of a geek artist named Art who calls phone numbers found on bathroom walls in hopes of landing a date. Mr. Kimball's no-holds-barred self-exposure, whether real or convincingly acted, is hilarious, but it is also a little creepy, which for some reason makes it touching. The gallery is filled with elements from his apartment, including a wall-to-wall curtain of dangling pipe-cleaner chains (Cotter).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''ART AT WORK: 40 YEARS OF THE CHASE MANHATTAN COLLECTION,'' Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-5555 (through Sunday). On the 40th anniversary of the Chase Manhattan Collection, which since 1960 has displayed more than 17,000 works of art in places where Chase does business, a sampling from its multinational, intercontinental holdings is on view here. Filling every corner of the museum, the work includes pieces by contemporary stars like Chuck Close, Scott Burton, Nam June Paik, Richard Prince and Christian Boltanski. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m. Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (John Russell).</p>
        <p>GREGORY GILLESPIE, Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, near East 58th Street, (212) 355-4545 (through tomorrow). This well-selected memorial retrospective includes fascinating  Bruegelesque miniatures from the 1960's; large-scale, altarlike portraits of the artist or his wife that combine Magic Realism, photocollage and raw materials like plywood, tile and metal; works of Robert Arneson-style comedy; ambitious essays in realist portraiture; and more. Gillespie's artistic identity never completely gelled, but it appears sadly clear that his potential was far from exhausted when he died this year at 63 (Johnson).</p>
        <p>KATY GRANNAN, ''Dream America,'' Lawrence Rubin, Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444 (through tomorrow). In her first solo exhibition this member of a new wavelet of young, adventurous female photographers presents a series of large portraits of ordinary, unnamed, mostly unclothed people in their own homes. Subjects answered ads for art models placed by the artist in small city newspapers. One may detect a note of hip condescension in Ms. Grannan's Pop-Conceptualist approach, but the images themselves have a vivid, unvarnished immediacy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* JOHN MORRIS, D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-9460 (through tomorrow). This Queens native works like a spider, spinning webs of wonderfully intricate doodling in graphite, ink, colored pencil and other materials. Eye-strainingly fine circles, arabesques, spirals and ovals are organized around and within larger structures like yin-yang compositions or leaf or egg forms, creating a joyful cosmic vision of organic growth and a layered complexity like that of Baroque music (Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''MARTHA ROSLER: POSITIONS IN THE LIFE WORLD,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Oct. 8), and International Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Sunday). This 30-year career retrospective is also the first major museum show for this seminal Brooklyn-born artist, and even spread over two museums, it's of a piece: crowded, agitated, funny and political. Ms. Rosler was involved in the peace movement and feminism in the 1960's and responded with art that combined moral brashness and a television-generation sense of the absurd. Aware of the co-opting power of the market, she chose mediums that were either ephemeral or easily reproduced and distributed. The show mixes all of them together, with video and photography -- her best work -- concentrated uptown and installations (including a cash-and-carry garage sale) at the New Museum. Despite her self-description as a ''ham-fisted'' artist, her work is full of subtleties. It may have little to say to a viewer for whom taste, style and beauty are the exclusive building blocks of art, but as an art of ideas that lead to actions, its deeply skeptical utopianism is as vital now as it was in the past. Hours and admission at the New Museum: See above. Hours at the International Center of Photography: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Center admission: $6; $4 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
