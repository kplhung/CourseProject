        <p>COMPUTERS have driven this economy to the longest expansion ever. Computer stocks have racked up some of the biggest gains of the bull market.</p>
        <p>But all good things must end someday, and the signs are growing that the end may be here. September has been a horrid one for computer-stock investors. If the growth of the computer industry is slowing, as seems to be happening, that has significant implications for corporate profits and for economic growth.</p>
        <p>The sense of alarm had not spread very far on Wall Street before last night, although bad news from Apple may change that. [Page C2.] Intel, the dominant maker of personal computer chips, is down 41 percent this month since its disclosure that revenue is running well below forecast. But much of the commentary on Intel focused not on the implications for the industry, but on explaining away the price drop. Some said that the market would have reacted more calmly if Intel had quietly prepared analysts, but that it was prevented from doing so by a new regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission barring selective disclosure -- a rule not yet in effect, as it happens.</p>
        <p>Such analysis insults investors and analysts, who are presumed to be able to handle bad news only if it is whispered rather than announced. And it overlooks the fact that many computer-related stocks have declined. Apple, for example, was down 12 percent this month before its bad news came out -- sending it down 45 percent more in after-hours trading. Microsoft rallied briefly after the Supreme Court decided not to hear the company's antitrust appeal immediately, but the shares soon fell to their lowest level since November 1998. (Microsoft, which went public in 1986, had never before traded at a 22-month low.)</p>
        <p>Greg Jensen of Bridgewater Associates, a money management firm, notes that movements in computer-stock prices have been a leading indicator of trends in computer-equipment orders. ''These stocks are now pointing to a big slowdown in computer investment,'' he says.</p>
        <p>If that indication is accurate -- and the government's durable goods figures make it clear that growth in computer orders is slowing sharply -- then slower economic growth is likely. Much of the growth in recent years has reflected the surge of investment in computer equipment.</p>
        <p>That investment has been even more important to corporate profits because money spent on computers counts as revenue for the seller -- thus raising profits -- but is treated as an investment by the buyer, thereby not harming that company's immediate profits.</p>
        <p>Why the slowdown? Many companies accelerated their spending in recent years to replace computers rather than deal with Year 2000 issues in the older equipment. Spending for Internet-related strategies remains strong -- EMC, the biggest company in data storage, is still setting new highs -- but other areas are weakening.</p>
        <p>At the low end -- the home and small-business markets -- computers may be starting to resemble cars. ''If somebody says things are slowing, maybe you wait a year to buy a new auto, or a new computer,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Slower growth for computers does not spell doom for the economy, or for the companies involved. But it does call into question the high multiples that computer stocks have come to enjoy. Even now, Intel trades for 33 times historic earnings. That is double the multiple it fetched a few years ago -- and four times that of General Motors.</p>
