        <p>Federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment today charging Boston's most infamous, and elusive, mob figure and his longtime associate with involvement in the killings of 21 people between them -- from rivals to strangers in the wrong place at the wrong time to their own girlfriends -- in ''a reign of intimidation and murder that spanned some 25 years.''</p>
        <p>Until today, United States Attorney Donald K. Stern said, the main defendant, James Bulger, had never been charged with murder, though he was indicted in racketeering in 1995. But in a long and complex investigation, Mr. Stern said, ''layer upon layer of myth, fear and protection have been stripped away.''</p>

        <p>Federal prosecutors unsealed an indictment today charging Boston's most infamous, and elusive, mob figure and his longtime associate with involvement in the killings of 21 people between them -- from rivals to strangers in the wrong place at the wrong time to their own girlfriends -- in ''a reign of intimidation and murder that spanned some 25 years.''</p>
        <p>Until today, United States Attorney Donald K. Stern said, the main defendant, James Bulger, had never been charged with murder, though he was indicted in racketeering in 1995. But in a long and complex investigation, Mr. Stern said, ''layer upon layer of myth, fear and protection have been stripped away.''</p>
        <p>Some of that protection came from the F.B.I. Mr. Bulger, 71, and his longtime associate, Stephen J. Flemmi, 66, were ''top-echelon informants'' from the early 1970's through the mid-1990's, the agency has admitted, and helped vanquish the local arm of La Cosa Nostra.</p>
        <p>The problem, prosecutors now say, was that while the F.B.I. was protecting Mr. Bulger, Mr. Flemmi and their Irish-dominated mob from other law enforcement agencies to keep their information coming, the two men were committing crimes as frightening as anything their Italian rivals might have contemplated. The case has raised serious questions about the often-murky relationships between law enforcement officials and criminal informers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flemmi is in prison awaiting trial since 1995 on racketeering charges. The relationship between Mr. Flemmi, Mr. Bulger and the F.B.I. emerged in Mr. Flemmi's pre-trial motions, because he has argued that the F.B.I. promised him and Mr. Bulger immunity for any crimes short of murder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bulger, who is known as Whitey, has been on the run since 1995 and is considered one of the most wanted men in America, with $250,000 offered for his capture. The authorities say he may be using the name Mark Shapeton.</p>
        <p>A bit more than a year ago, the outlook for prosecutors appeared bleak, and critics said they might not be able to make their case against Mr. Flemmi and Mr. Bulger stand up. But Mr. Stern said today that they had made great progress, in particular by making deals with associates of Mr. Bulger.</p>
        <p>In recent months, at least two associates, John Martorano, a confessed hit man, and Kevin Weeks, who has been described as Mr. Bulger's top lieutenant, have been given deals for crimes of their own in exchange for information. With it, the authorities unearthed five bodies of victims that they are now charging Mr. Bulger and Mr. Flemmi with murdering. Today, excavation was still under way as the authorities searched for a body in the Boston suburb of Quincy.</p>
        <p>Today's indictment charged Mr. Bulger and Mr. Flemmi with a pattern of violence meant to protect their criminal dealings. Their crimes included, prosecutors said, murdering potential witnesses against them and corrupting law enforcement officers. Also charged in the indictment is Kevin P. O'Neil, another associate of Mr. Bulger.</p>
        <p>The indictment also says the two killed their girlfriends because they thought what they knew posed a threat; other victims were killed, the indictment charges, to gain control of their business, to eliminate rivals, and, in one case, out of revenge for losing a fight. It also accuses the two men of drug-trafficking, extortion, money laundering and more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said today that the crimes in the indictment were not eligible for the death penalty in Massachusetts and the federal system, but that prosecutors would seek life in prison for both men.</p>
        <p>Kenneth J. Fishman, Mr. Flemmi's lawyer, said he could not comment because he had not yet discussed the indictment with his client.</p>
        <p>As more and more damaging accusations surface about Mr. Bulger, officials acknowledge that the F.B.I.'s protection of him looks worse and worse. The case had already prompted sweeping internal investigations of the bureau's Boston branch and a months-long policy review by the Department of Justice, which has moved to tighten its rules for handling such informers.</p>
        <p>Late last year, prosecutors also indicted a retired F.B.I. agent, John J. Connolly Jr., accusing him of racketeering and, in particular, of warning Mr. Bulger of his impending arrest in time for him to escape.</p>
