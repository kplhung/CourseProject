        <p>Consolidated Edison and Orange and Rockland Utilities urged federal energy regulators yesterday to reform New York State's wholesale electricity market to reduce energy prices.</p>
        <p>The utility companies, blamed by  many of their customers for this summer's high electricity bills, contended that they were not responsible for the higher charges, which they called the result of excessively high wholesale energy costs in the state's deregulated electricity market.</p>
        <p>The utilities' request came in papers filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a proceeding involving the New York State Independent System Operator, which administrates the wholesale energy market in the state.</p>
        <p>Among the changes the two utilities urged was revision of Independent System Operator ''market rules and procedures that discourage economically efficient imports'' of electricity from other regions, like New England. They also called for changes in rules power generators must follow, to avoid severe day-to-day fluctuation in electricity prices.</p>
