        <p>The battle between Boeing and Airbus Industrie for the future of large-scale jetliners could reach a decisive point on Friday when Singapore Airlines, the profitable and prestigious Asian carrier more famous for flight attendants than financial muscle, announces its latest plans to buy new aircraft.</p>
        <p>Airbus and Boeing have been courting Singapore Airlines for months in hopes of winning its endorsement of their rival visions of a new superjumbo aircraft capable of carrying at least 500 passengers halfway around the world without refueling.</p>
        <p>Airbus is struggling to generate enough orders to justify production of its 550-seat A3XX. Boeing has countered with a stretched version of its familiar 747 jumbo. Singapore Airlines has said it will announce its choice by the end of next month, but industry executives were speculating that it would do so at a Friday news conference.</p>
        <p>The airline has remained silent on just what purchase it will announce. Even the two rival manufacturers will not be told until shortly before the announcement. Singapore Airlines is also in the market for smaller midrange jets to replace 15 older Airbus A310-300's it now uses across southern Asia. Whatever purchases the carrier announces, ''it's going to be a big order,'' said Rick Clements, a Singapore Airlines spokesman.</p>
        <p>Replacing 15 midrange aircraft could represent billions of dollars in new orders and might indicate whether Singapore Airlines is consolidating its fleet toward a single manufacturer to cut costs, as are many other carriers.</p>
        <p>But a decision on the superjumbo would send a powerful signal about the future of air travel.</p>
        <p>Though it is only Asia's seventh-largest airline, Singapore Airlines is regarded as an industry bellwether. Profitable despite offering a premium service and one of the industry's youngest fleets, Singapore Airlines heralded its global ambitions last year when it announced it would pay nearly $1 billion for 49 percent of Virgin Atlantic, which is controlled by Richard Branson.</p>
        <p>The carrier is considering buying as many as a dozen superjumbo aircraft, according to some people in the industry. A giant order in and of itself, the carrier's choice could influence a debate that has so far centered on whether airlines need larger planes to fly farther, or smaller planes to fly more frequently.</p>
        <p>Singapore Airlines has said it needs a wide selection of just about everything. Mr. Clements said Singapore Airlines is planning to use the superjumbos on its most popular flights to Europe and on longer flights within Asia when they become available in roughly five years.</p>
        <p>Boeing's 747 has been the biggest jetliner for the last 30 years, and is still the only aircraft capable of carrying more than 400 passengers. Airbus hopes to end the jumbo's reign this year by building the A3XX, which it envisions as an airborne cruise ship, complete with a casino and gym.</p>
        <p>An order from Singapore Airlines would be crucial: Airbus needs at least 40 orders by some estimates to justify the $11 billion cost of producing its new behemoth. So far, it has orders for 22 A3XX's from Air France, Emirates Airlines and the International Lease Finance Corporation. Singapore Airlines' biggest competitor, Qantas of Australia, is also considering a purchase of the aircraft, said Sean Lee, regional communications director of Airbus in Singapore.</p>
