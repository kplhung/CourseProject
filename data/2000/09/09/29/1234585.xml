        <p>Leslie Saint Bornstein Op-Ed article on being nonunion actor who has crossed Screen Actors Guild picket line to audition for television commercial; complains that actor cannot get into union unless he or she has union job, and cannot get that job without being in union or knowing somebody with pull (M)</p>

        <p>I am a scab, a nonunion actor who crossed the Screen Actors Guild picket line to audition for and act in a commercial. This may be the first issue on which Susan Sarandon and I disagree.</p>
        <p>At stake is how to pay actors for their work in TV commercials. Advertisers want to pay a flat fee for all ads on network TV, as they do for cable. S.A.G. wants advertisers to continue paying actors each time a commercial is shown on network TV, and to adopt that policy for cable and the Internet, too. On May 1 S.A.G. called a strike, prohibiting its members from performing in commercials.</p>

        <p>I am a scab, a nonunion actor who crossed the Screen Actors Guild picket line to audition for and act in a commercial. This may be the first issue on which Susan Sarandon and I disagree.</p>
        <p>At stake is how to pay actors for their work in TV commercials. Advertisers want to pay a flat fee for all ads on network TV, as they do for cable. S.A.G. wants advertisers to continue paying actors each time a commercial is shown on network TV, and to adopt that policy for cable and the Internet, too. On May 1 S.A.G. called a strike, prohibiting its members from performing in commercials.</p>
        <p>I never wanted to be a scab; I wanted to be in the union. But S.A.G. has a Catch-22 : you can't get into the union unless you have a union job, and you can't get a union job unless you're in the union (unless you know somebody with enough pull or you are exactly what they're looking for). The union dictates that I can't even be considered for a commercial until all S.A.G. actors of my type have been seen. And since I am a middle-aged woman, odds are low that I will even be seen by a casting director.</p>
        <p>But right now I can get into S.A.G. by putting in 80 hours manning the picket lines and harassing non-S.A.G. actors as they go on auditions (there was such an overwhelming response to this offer that the union stopped putting names on the waiting list). I can also join if I alert the union when I book a commercial so they can set up a picket line. By refusing to cross, I will get my card immediately. These conditions may not come under the rubric of illegal labor practices, but they seem pretty unfair to me.</p>
        <p>The strike's most vocal supporters seem to be the least affected. Instead of wearing yellow ribbons to the Emmys, why didn't Matthew Perry and Jennifer Aniston just not show up? After all, the show is supported by advertisers. Or Richard Dreyfuss could say he will never make another movie with a product placement.</p>
        <p>Other unions aren't actively supporting this strike, because S.A.G. doesn't support them. Shortly after the strike began, all 35 S.A.G. film actors on the New York set of ''Perfume'' crossed a picket line of stage employees protesting a nonunion crew. If S.A.G. has no qualms about working with a nonunion crew, why should the crew care whether it works with non-S.A.G. actors?</p>
        <p>At 6:45 on a recent drizzly morning I was greeted by four protesters as I approached the van that was to take me to location. They harangued me and took my photograph. When the strike was over, they warned, I would be forever barred from joining the union. This sounds like a Hollywood blacklist to me, but maybe I'm letting my imagination run away with me.</p>
