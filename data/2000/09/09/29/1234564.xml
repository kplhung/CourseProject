        <p>Shares of Mizuho Holdings Inc., the large bank holding company formed from the merger of three Japanese banks -- Fuji Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan -- rose 6.5 percent today in their first day of trading, despite increasing skepticism about the new institution's prospects.</p>
        <p>Mizuho, which means fresh, juicy rice in Japanese, replaces Deutsche Bank of Germany as the world's largest bank, ranked by assets. The three banks under its umbrella held a combined 134.4 trillion yen, or $1.25 trillion, in assets at the end of the fiscal year on March 31.</p>
        <p>Mizuho's shares rose 53,000 yen today, or about $493 a share, to 870,000 yen, giving it a market value of eight trillion yen, or about $74 billion -- the fourth-most-valuable bank after Bank of America, which has a market value of about $88 billion.</p>
        <p>A bank's size and market value, however, are not necessarily reflections of profitability, ingenuity and strength. A report released this week by Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, was titled ''Consolidation No Cure-All for Japanese Banks.''</p>
        <p>While the report did not refer to Mizuho, many of the concerns it raised relate to the new bank. Naoko Nemoto, the analyst who wrote the report, noted that the negative aspects of consolidation are often ignored, including cultural differences and the risk of hidden liabilities.</p>
        <p>''Standard &amp; Poor's is concerned that the banks are currently not addressing these with sufficient vigor,'' Ms. Nemoto said in a statement.</p>
        <p>There were some signs earlier this summer, however, that the three banks that formed Mizuho were in fact doing enough inspection of each others' books to become concerned about the condition of their partners' balance sheets. At one point, officials at the Financial Reconstruction Commission, the agency that is overseeing attempts to strengthen Japan's banks, were worried that the deal might collapse. In banking circles, competitors were referring to Mizuho as ''mizuko,'' which means aborted or miscarried fetus.</p>
        <p>The financial system has yet to work through its sizable bad-debt problem. While the banks moved quickly to write down problem loans and build reserves in the aftermath of a financial crisis in 1997, their efforts have decreased since the government used trillions of yen in public money to strengthen their capital base in 1999.</p>
        <p>Since then, the bad-debt problem has again increased, partly because of a surge in bankruptcies and debt waivers, and talk of a second injection of public money is on the rise.</p>
