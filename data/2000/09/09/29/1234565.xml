        <p>Several major South Carolina food chains are boycotting Maurice Bessinger's popular barbecue sauce ever since Bessinger, once a forceful advocate for segregation, put Confederate and state flags over his headquarters and lowered American flag; Bessinger is still vocal in his defense of slavery; only notable defender of Bessinger so far has been Patrick J Buchanan, whose presidential campaign established its state headquarters in Bessinger building; photos (M)</p>

        <p>The sauce itself is an act of defiance: a thick, yellow mustardy glaze that dares to call itself a barbecue sauce despite its utter lack of tomatoes. South Carolinians are among the only humans known to allow it upon their meat.</p>
        <p>But it was the racial notions of its maker, not its heretical formula, that led to the banishment of Maurice's All Natural Gourmet Blend BBQ Sauce from the grocery shelves of six major retailers in the Southeast in the last two weeks. The sauce, like the huge Confederate battle flag that flies over its manufacturer's headquarters, has become a redolent symbol of the change in the attitudes in the South, a change that infuriates the sauce's namesake.</p>
        <p>With a white sport coat to match his hair and mustache, Maurice Bessinger even looks like the South of the 1950's, a time when he was a forceful advocate for segregation, and at quiet moments he seems almost wistful for a time when he could state plainly his feelings about race without suffering financially for it.</p>
        <p>''People say my restaurant never served blacks, but that's just not true,'' he said, sitting in the headquarters office of Maurice's Piggy Park, a chain of restaurants that has come to define South Carolina barbecue. ''We just served them on a segregated basis, like every other restaurant did. What the blacks didn't realize was that they got the best food, because their dining room was actually in the kitchen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bessinger spent much of the 1950's and 60's attacking race-mixing, running the National Association for the Preservation of White People and refusing to let blacks into his main dining room, long after most other restaurants had given in. The Supreme Court eventually forced him to comply with the law.</p>
        <p>A few years later, he became a born-again Christian and said he put aside his notions of racial superiority. He set up a religious mission next to his main restaurant, in West Columbia, and began distributing tracts that combined his love of the Confederacy with his religious beliefs, and it is those tracts that have now landed him in trouble. The one attracting most attention is entitled ''Biblical View of Slavery,'' by John Weaver, a Baptist minister from Fitzgerald, Ga., and argues that slavery is not inherently evil because it is permitted in the Bible.</p>
        <p>''Don't let anyone try to load you with guilt and say you need to make reparations for what your forefathers did,'' says the tract, which is on sale for $1 at the restaurant, alongside Bibles and Confederate memorabilia. ''No! What our forefathers did was not evil in and of itself. That doesn't mean that some of our forefathers did not act evilly, wickedly themselves, and if they did, they are responsible for their own sins.''</p>
        <p>The pamphlet also argues that many African slaves ''blessed the Lord'' for allowing them to be enslaved, because their life in slavery was better than in Africa.</p>
        <p>These ideas came to light last month when they were printed by John Monk, a columnist at The State, Columbia's daily newspaper. Mr. Bessinger had already been in the news for lowering the American flag over his headquarters and replacing it with the state and Confederate battle flags after the State Legislature voted to remove its Confederate  flag from the Capitol dome.</p>
        <p>These events led the stores -- including Winn-Dixie, Bi-Lo, Kroger and Wal-Mart -- to stop selling Mr. Bessinger's immensely popular condiment and boxes of his frozen barbecued pork. The stores have apparently decided that the number of Southerners likely to be offended by Mr. Bessinger's beliefs is now greater than the mustard and Confederate traditionalists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bessinger's business activities ''are unacceptable to us as a company and to many of our customers,'' said a statement issued by Bi-Lo Supermarkets, which has 286 stores in the South and is based in Mauldin, S.C. ''We believe that removing his products from Bi-Lo stores will reinforce our belief in the dignity of each individual who shops with us.''</p>
        <p>Other stores cited similar reasons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bessinger said more than 40 percent of his business came from retail sales of his sauce and packaged barbecue and warned of layoffs among his 250 employees if he could not distribute his products. He said his religious rights were being violated, though he acknowledged that the stores had a right to choose which products to sell, and said the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce had organized a politically correct conspiracy against him. (The chamber, which was active in having the flag removed from the Capitol dome, denied a similar role in the sauce's disappearance.)</p>
        <p>''I am not pro-slavery,'' he said, ''but no man on earth can make me deny what the Bible says about slavery. The stores are just yielding to outside pressure from people who want to destroy the Constitution and remake America to fit their globalism strategy.''</p>
        <p>The only notable defender of Mr. Bessinger so far has been Patrick J. Buchanan, whose presidential campaign has established its state headquarters in the Piggy Park building.</p>
        <p>Across the street from the building, in the Food Lion grocery store, there is a wide empty space on the barbecue-sauce shelf that was once filled by Carolina Gold, as Bessinger sauce is sometimes known. Eddie Miles, the store manager, said dozens of people had complained about the missing sauce, but only a few on ideological grounds.</p>
        <p>''I don't think most of them even know about it,'' he said. ''They just like the sauce. You know, it's the only one that has mustard in it.''</p>
