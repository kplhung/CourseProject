        <p>June Kelly</p>
        <p>591 Broadway, near Houston Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>Through Tuesday</p>
        <p>This modest retrospective is a fitting tribute to Hughie Lee-Smith, who died last year at 83. A painter whose easel-scale realism tended to drift into a kind of lucid dreaming with social overtones, Lee-Smith had a deft, understated touch that, at best, produced haunting moods and metaphorically resonant images.</p>
        <p>While the more recent works are too sweetly sentimental or fantastic, paintings from the 60's or 70's have a warm, muted palette and a lonesome, Hopperesque narrative tension. ''Two Boys,'' in which the tiny figures of a pair of youths occupy either side of a desolate, concrete pier, and ''Trio,'' the enigmatic image of three men -- one black, one white, one with his back turned -- on a rubble-strewn beach, both exude an existentialist air of sadness about the possibilities of human connection.</p>
        <p>A motif that recurs throughout the show, beginning with the 1949 ''Bouquet,'' is the image of a girl in a short skirt who seems an unreachable object of desire. In a painting from 1985 she stands at a slight distance before a tilled field, wearing a pink dress and a straw hat casting her eyes in shadow. She might personify the elusive yet fertile spirit of poetry that animated Lee-Smith's art.</p>
