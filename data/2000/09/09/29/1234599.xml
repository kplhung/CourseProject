        <p>Two former top executives of a Georgia medical software company were indicted yesterday, accused of costing investors more than $9 billion in one of the largest financial frauds in American history.</p>
        <p>As co-presidents of HBO &amp; Company for most of 1998, Albert J. Bergonzi and Jay P. Gilbertson used sham deals and bad accounting to inflate the company's revenue and earnings by hundreds of millions of dollars, according to federal prosecutors in San Francisco, who announced the indictments. If convicted, the two men each face up to 10 years in jail and a $1 million fine.</p>
        <p>HBO &amp; Company was acquired by McKesson, a distributor of prescription drugs based in San Francisco, in January 1999 for $14 billion. When the merged McKesson HBO announced that its auditors had discovered fraud in April 1999, its shares fell almost 50 percent in one day, leaving investors $9 billion poorer. McKesson HBO stock has yet to recover.</p>
        <p>The indictment comes as the Securities and Exchange Commission steps up efforts to work more closely with federal prosecutors in cases of serious financial wrongdoing. Over the last two years, Richard Walker, the S.E.C.'s director of enforcement, has visited United States attorneys in several cities to offer the commission's help to prosecutors interested in filing financial fraud charges.</p>
        <p>''I'm hoping cases like this will send a message to corporate boardrooms and suites that they actually could go to jail for this,'' said Leslie Caldwell, chief of securities fraud for the United States attorney's office in San Francisco. ''This isn't just managing your numbers or tweaking accounts here and there. This is putting your whole company at risk, and if you do that, there are going to be serious consequences.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Mr. Bergonzi and Mr. Gilbertson denied the criminal charges, as well as a related civil complaint filed by the S.E.C.</p>
        <p>Dominick A. DeRosa, a former HBO vice president, agreed to pay more than $411,000 to settle an S.E.C. complaint against him in the case. Mr. DeRosa was not charged in the criminal case, and Ms. Caldwell said Mr. DeRosa was cooperating with prosecutors.</p>
        <p>HBO's fast growth in sales and profits made it a favorite of investors throughout the 1990's. Its stock rose more than a hundredfold between October 1990 and October 1998, when HBO agreed to be acquired by McKesson, the largest distributor of prescription drugs in the United States. At the time, the two companies had a combined market value of more than $23 billion.</p>
        <p>But when the merged McKesson HBO announced in April 1999 that its auditors had discovered fraud at HBO during a routine annual review, McKesson HBO shares fell to $34 from $65 in a single day. HBO McKesson stock rose 38 cents, to close at $30.50 yesterday, giving the company a market value of less than $9 billion.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said Mr. Bergonzi and Mr. Gilbertson, desperate to ensure that HBO would meet or beat analysts' expectations for sales and profits, used several schemes to inflate the company's results.</p>
        <p>Throughout 1998, they allowed more than a dozen hospitals to buy HBO software or services with conditional ''side letters'' that allowed the hospitals to back out of the deals, according to the indictment. Then they hid the side letters from auditors and reported those sales as complete, violating accounting rules. In at least one case, a hospital canceled a purchase HBO had booked, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>To further bolster its results, HBO also agreed to huge sham sales with two other large computer companies, according to the indictment. On Sept. 28, 1998, two days before the end of HBO's quarter and just weeks before HBO and McKesson agreed to merge, the two men agreed to buy $73.8 million in software from Computer Associates, supposedly for resale, according to the indictment.</p>
        <p>In return, Computer Associates of Long Island, a maker of software used by big companies, bought $30 million in HBO software, also supposedly for resale.</p>
        <p>To make the deals seem separate, the men ''split the transaction into separate contracts, neither of which made any reference to the other,'' the indictment asserts. In the two years since it bought HBO's software, Computer Associates ''has neither made use of nor distributed any of the $30 million in HBOC software products,'' according to the indictment. Similarly, HBO had sold only a fraction of the $74 million in Computer Associates software it bought.</p>
        <p>In March 1999, McKesson HBO and Data General, a computer hardware maker based in Massachusetts, agreed to a similar deal, prosecutors said. It was that deal that eventually led to the fraud discovery, when Data General disclosed to auditors that what appeared to be a simple $20 million purchase of HBO's software had a side agreement that essentially ensured that Data General would never have to pay for it.</p>
        <p>The frauds increased HBO's revenue by $230 million, or more than 20 percent, in the final three quarters of 1999, according to the indictment. Profits were overstated by $170 million, or nearly 80 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilbertson left HBO in November 1998 to become the president of WebMD, an Internet health care company. He resigned from WebMD in June 1999 after McKesson HBO said it had discovered the fraud. McKesson HBO fired Mr. Bergonzi and other former top HBO executives in June 1999. A McKesson spokesman said yesterday that only one former HBO executive is now among the top 20 executives of the merged company, and that that person joined HBO only in December 1998.</p>
        <p>Ms. Caldwell and S.E.C. officials said that the investigation was continuing and that more complaints or charges might be filed. Charles McCall, the former chairman of HBO, has not been charged with wrongdoing in the case.</p>
        <p>Ms. Caldwell said McKesson HBO was unlikely to be charged with fraud because the company immediately began an investigation when it discovered the problems and told the public and the authorities promptly. ''The company basically did the right thing when they discovered there was a fraud,'' Ms. Caldwell said.</p>
        <p>The case is reminiscent of another pending case, in which three executives of CUC International, including the former chief financial officer, have pleaded guilty to fraud charges stemming from false financial reporting that was discovered only after the company merged with HFS to form the Cendant Corporation. That investigation is continuing.</p>
