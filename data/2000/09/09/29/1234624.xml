        <p>City health officials are urging Staten Island residents to give blood for tests to determine how many people in the borough have been infected by the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>After similar testing last October in northern Queens, the center of the first outbreak, officials said that one in 20 people there had been infected, although most showed no symptoms of illness. This year, Staten Island was the hardest hit of the five boroughs -- 9 of the 13 people who became seriously ill were infected by the virus, which is carried by mosquitoes. The only death was in New Jersey.</p>

        <p>City health officials are urging Staten Island residents to give blood for tests to determine how many people in the borough have been infected by the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>After similar testing last October in northern Queens, the center of the first outbreak, officials said that one in 20 people there had been infected, although most showed no symptoms of illness. This year, Staten Island was the hardest hit of the five boroughs -- 9 of the 13 people who became seriously ill were infected by the virus, which is carried by mosquitoes. The only death was in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The Staten Island blood tests will be handled differently this time, said health officials, who have decided that the Queens blood collection was flawed in an important way. Those samples were collected from anonymous donors using vans parked throughout the neighborhood. That made it difficult to determine whether the donors actually lived in the area, which could have distorted the results, officials said.</p>
        <p>The Staten Island survey will be conducted door-to-door and will be confidential, but not anonymous. Starting Tuesday, officials from the city's Health Department and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will collect blood samples on a voluntary basis from 700 Staten Island residents to see how many have been exposed to the mosquito-borne virus.</p>
        <p>''We're hoping that the residents of Staten Island will roll up their sleeves to help us in our fight against this virus,'' said Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner. ''From the results of this survey, we hope to get a better understanding of how to reduce the risk factors and prevent infection.''</p>
        <p>The Health Department will also set up vans as alternative sites for interviewing and testing. People who are not Staten Island residents will not be allowed to participate, officials said. Participants will be asked whether they took precautions against infection, like staying indoors at dusk or dawn or using insect repellent. They will be sent the test results in several months.</p>
        <p>''The best way to fight this disease is education,'' said Steven M. Ostroff, the West Nile coordinator for the disease control centers. ''We have made so much headway from last year simply by knowing more about this disease.''</p>
        <p>A person who tests positive for the virus, Dr. Ostroff noted, is not contagious and has probably already mounted a healthy immune response to the virus. People most vulnerable to becoming ill include the elderly, children younger than 5 and those with weakened immune systems. The symptoms, including a fever, can resemble the flu. The most serious symptom is encephalitis, a brain inflammation that can be fatal.</p>
        <p>Last year, the virus caused 62 confirmed cases of serious illness in the region, including 7 deaths from encephalitis, according to the disease control centers. After the blood tests in northern Queens, officials estimated that another 530 to 1,900 people there had been exposed to the virus.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 30, 2000, Saturday  An article yesterday about plans to conduct confidential blood tests door to door on Staten Island to detect exposure levels to West Nile virus referred incompletely to the methods used in an anonymous testing program last fall in northern Queens. Blood samples were collected in door-to-door visits, not just at vans in the neighborhood.</p>
