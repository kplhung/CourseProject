        <p>A United States women's volleyball team that arrived here little known and lowly rated took Russia to a fifth game tonight for the right to play for the Olympic gold medal. But the American squad, seeded 10th in a 12-nation field, finally lost to the second-seeded Russians in a tough 90-minute semifinal.</p>
        <p>The Russians, who won, 25-15, 23-25, 25-15, 26-28, 15-8, will face Cuba, the defending two-time Olympic champion, for the gold medal. The Cubans beat third-seeded Brazil, 27-29, 25-19, 21-25, 25-19, 15-9, in the other semifinal. The United States and Brazil will play for the bronze medal on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the United States team repeatedly battled back from huge deficits against the more experienced Russians. After trailing, 19-13, in the fourth set, the Americans won a dramatic series of set points to take the game, 28-26. In the fifth set, the Russians, led by their twin towers,  6-foot-4-inch Yelena Godina and 6-3 Yevgeniya Artamanova, finally pulled away from the Americans. From 7-7 in the final game, Russia won 8 of the last 9 points of the match. Godina finished with 28 kills and Artamanova had 26, Lyubov Chachkova added 23.</p>
        <p>The Olympic veterans Danielle Scott, 27, and Tara Cross-Battle, 32, and Logan Tom, a 19-year-old newcomer, were the mainstays of the American attack. Scott had a team-high 21 kills and Tom 15. While most of the Americans said they were disappointed with tonight's outcome, they took solace in their strong showing in the tournament. They upset fourth-seeded China in four sets and edged fifth-seeded South Korea in a thrilling five-set quarterfinal Wednesday. In that comeback, the Americans rallied from a 12-9 deficit in the fifth set, winning 4 straight points to gain a lead they never relinquished. And tonight they gave the Russians a stiffer challenge than expected.</p>
        <p>The United States team manager, Robert Gambardella, put its Olympic performance in perspective. ''Everybody said we'd finish 10th here,'' he said. ''Instead, this team has made history. Some players have very little international experience and yet they made the semis and the playoff.''</p>
        <p>Scott looked forward to playing again. ''The Russians have been an exceptional team for a long time, but we had a chance to win tonight,'' she said. ''A lot of people didn't think we could get this far. And we are not through yet. We still have a chance for bronze against Brazil on Saturday.''</p>
        <p>And Cuba has a chance for an unprecedented third straight volleyball gold thanks to the victory over Brazil. Cuba raced away from Brazil in the deciding set tonight with a series of spectacular 60-mile-per-hour spikes.</p>
        <p>The Cuba-Brazil match had the feel of a gold medal showdown. Traditional regional rivals with similar aggressive styles, the two teams had clashed after Cuba's heated five-game semifinal victory in Atlanta in 1996. In that match, players sniped at one another during play and the tension boiled over during the post-match handshake at the net. They slapped each other and scuffled again at the tunnel leading to the locker rooms.</p>
        <p>They were well-behaved tonight, although the Cuban blocker Regla Torres glared at the Brazilians from across the net. ''I think there were problems, but those problems are nonexistent now,'' said the Cuban captain, Regla Bell.</p>
        <p>Brazil displayed marginally better form than Cuba going into tonight's match, winning all five of its games in a week of preliminaries. In those games, Brazil accumulated 395 points to its opponents' 272, including a low-gear defeat of the United States team in four sets. Cuba lost only to Russia in the round-robin eliminations.</p>
        <p>Led by the 6-3 Torres, Cuba never trailed in the deciding fifth game tonight, taking some drama out of the finish. ''It was a hard game and both teams were very nervous,'' said Martenis Costa, a Cuban attacker. ''We are used to winning and when we got even with Brazil in the fourth set we felt confident we could win.''</p>
