        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign began broadcasting this 30-second advertisement in downstate New York yesterday. A similar ad, the campaign said, will be shown upstate.</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''Affordable''  PRODUCER -- Team Hillary  ON THE SCREEN -- Various images of Mrs. Clinton campaigning, including shots of her holding a baby, meeting with the elderly and talking with people at a diner. The main points appear in writing superimposed over the video clips. When Representative Rick A. Lazio is mentioned, the screen goes black and the written words appear alone.  THE SCRIPT -- ''Hillary Clinton supports tax cuts. That's right. She has a plan for a $10,000 tax deduction to help pay for college, tax credits for long-term care and for child care, a reduction of the marriage tax and the estate tax, and Hillary's tax cut plan is affordable. We'd still be able to pay down the debt, and extend Social Security. Rick Lazio's tax plan costs more than a trillion dollars. And just like George Bush, Lazio's plans squander the whole surplus. Hillary. The right tax cuts. The right choice.''  ACCURACY -- While opposing across-the-board tax relief, Mrs. Clinton has pushed for limited tax cuts, including those mentioned in the commercial, that promote certain social goals. With her proposal to place ''debt-reduction caps'' on tax cuts and new spending, it is true that her tax cuts would not get in the way of paying down the debt or continuing Social Security. Mrs. Clinton's claim about the high cost of Mr. Lazio's tax plan is grounded in an analysis by Frank J. Mauro of the liberal Fiscal Policy Institute in Albany. The institute is independent, but is financed in part by labor organizations, and Mr. Mauro has worked for the Democrats in the State Assembly. Mr. Lazio's campaign says that the analysis is not objective and estimates that his tax cuts would cost about $776 billion over 10 years, not the $1.1 trillion suggested by Mr. Mauro. The ad's claim that Mr. Lazio's plans would consume the entire surplus is also based on Mr. Mauro's report; Mr. Lazio offers very different numbers. The ad does not make clear that Mr. Lazio's ''plans'' are not just tax cuts, as implied, but include new spending on such things as education and prescription drugs.  SCORECARD -- By its own admission, the ad surprises the viewer with its notion that Mrs. Clinton advocates tax cuts. She has not made cutting taxes a hallmark of her campaign, instead suggesting that far-reaching tax relief would be fiscally irresponsible. Her tax cut proposals are very modest, especially compared with those proposed by Mr. Lazio and other Republicans. Her approach to taxes is very similar to that of Vice President Al Gore, who began running an ad this week that mentions the same college tuition deduction. Dan McLagan, Mr. Lazio's spokesman, said, ''Mrs. Clinton has told a number of fibs during this campaign; this ad is a whopper.'' More accurately, the ad presents a particular version of the truth, one that appears to be aimed at voters who like the idea of tax cuts but assume that Mrs. Clinton opposes them. It also seeks to steal the thunder from one of Mr. Lazio's major campaign initiatives.</p>
