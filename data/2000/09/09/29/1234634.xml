        <p>Last Feb. 22, Gov. George W. Bush lost the Michigan Republican primary to Senator John McCain of Arizona, thanks to a notably poor showing among independents, moderates and women.</p>
        <p>Seven months later, in this same pivotal Great Lakes state, he is again having trouble attracting independents, moderates and women in his race against Vice President Al Gore. The race is close here, with Mr. Gore very narrowly ahead. Demographically very similar to the United States as a whole, Michigan has seen a Bush lead, a Gore bounce and now a bit of a Bush comeback.</p>
        <p>Yet as Mr. Bush arrived in the state for a pair of fund-raisers tonight in Oakland County, just north of Detroit, and an appearance Friday in Saginaw, he was still searching for ways to ratchet his campaign up a notch.</p>
        <p>Prominent Republicans have plenty of suggestions to offer him.</p>
        <p>''He needs to cloak himself in McCain in this state,'' said Jerry Roe, a former executive director of the state Republican Party, who backed Mr. McCain in the primary. ''The moderates and the independents were terribly disappointed when he chose Dick Cheney for vice president. A town hall meeting with McCain, maybe two, in crucial counties like Macomb and Oakland, might do the trick.''</p>
        <p>Other Republican officials said Mr. Bush should carry the fight more directly to the vice president by attacking him as a threat to the auto industry, which is still Michigan's lifeblood (although much of the action has switched from the Big Three automakers to dozens of small, innovative engineering outfits along the expressways fanning out from Detroit).</p>
        <p>Anything that cut into Mr. Gore's union support here would be invaluable to the Texas governor. Almost a third of Michigan's likely voters live in union households, and Mr. Gore leads among them by 55 percent to 28 percent, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll of 1,145 registered voters between Sept. 22 and 25.  Governor Bush leads among nonunion voters.</p>
        <p>The survey, which had a margin of sampling error of three percentage points, showed Mr. Gore ahead by seven points among all registered voters, but only four points ahead, 45 to 41, among likely voters. If the numbers are adjusted to account for past turnout patterns, the race is even.</p>
        <p>Bill Ballenger, who publishes ''Inside Michigan Politics,'' a highly regarded newsletter, said that Mr. Bush's ''character'' campaign against Mr. Gore had failed, and that the focus of the campaign had switched to issues. On the most important ones, he asserted, the vice president has the advantage, with ''a more understandable prescription drugs plan and a tax plan that's selling because it helps pay down the deficit and puts more resources into the kind of programs that people here want.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, interviews with voters in the state suggest, Mr. Gore has been damaged by a tendency to exaggerate or even to fabricate, and his staunch advocacy of protecting the environment can cut both ways.</p>
        <p>In his book ''Earth in the Balance'' Mr. Gore described the internal combustion engine as ''a mortal threat to the security of every nation -- more clearly than that of any military enemy we are again likely to confront.''  Sensing a big opening for Mr. Bush, Rusty Hills, the Michigan Republican chairman, who is a close associate of Gov. John Engler, said on Wednesday: ''That is just plain nutty. If we can tell every auto worker Gore said that, we can win this election.''</p>
        <p>One way to do so would be in television commercials, but 35 percent of Michigan voters, the Times/ CBS poll shows, already view Mr. Bush's advertisements as negative, compared with 21 percent who view Mr. Gore's as negative. Probably not coincidentally, 48 percent said the vice president's commercials had given them an improved image of him, while only 32 percent thought better of Mr. Bush after watching his commercials.</p>
        <p>As in a half-dozen other states, voters here have been immersed in the campaign, though the effect is not yet clear. Well over three-quarters of respondents in the polls said they had seen commercials for the presidential nominees -- a surprisingly high figure more than five weeks from Election Day -- and the news is jam-packed with politics. Yet 4 out of 10 of each man's backers had reservations about their votes.</p>
        <p>''The sheer volume of advertising, back to back, day after day, the constant political palaver, may have reached some kind of limit of influence,'' said Hugh McDiarmid, political columnist for The Detroit Free Press. ''It may be a wash. At any rate, nothing is producing any marked changes so far.</p>
        <p>''In this kind of situation, I think the debates could count a lot.''</p>
        <p>David W. Rohde, a political scientist at Michigan State University in East Lansing, argued that this election differs from many in the last two decades in its fluidity. In 1980, with an unpopular incumbent, Jimmy Carter, the result was more or less foreordained, he said, as it was again in 1996, with a popular incumbent, Bill Clinton.</p>
        <p>This time, he said, ''with no incumbent and both candidates relatively moderate in relation to their parties, you get the feeling that nothing is locked in for the 10 percent that drifts back and forth -- exactly the kind of race where the outcome could be affected by a dramatic event like the debates, especially the first one.''</p>
        <p>That will take place next Tuesday in Boston, with two more later.</p>
        <p>The uncommitted and uncertain voters in this state tend to be ticket-splitters, a phenomenon evident as long ago as 1964, when President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, carried the state by a million votes, while George Romney, a Republican, was winning the governor's race by 300,000 votes. So local politicians would not be even slightly surprised to see Mr. Gore and Senator Spencer Abraham, a Republican, pulling off the same trick in November.</p>
        <p>But in other respects Michigan has changed radically. The state is no longer singing the Rust Belt blues, and its population, 9.3 million in 1990, is approaching 10 million. Both its politics and its economy, long static, have entered a dynamic era, marked by widespread innovation and reform.</p>
        <p>The change is particularly noticeable here in the belt of suburbs, exurbs and edge cities north of Detroit.  Macomb County is no longer dominated by the party-switching Democrats who helped Ronald Reagan win a majority of the union vote in 1984, and Oakland County, the state's second largest, after Wayne (Detroit), is no longer as automatically Republican as it once was.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's fate in Michigan may well depend on how he does in Macomb and Oakland, both of which were carried by his father in 1988 and 1992. Former Senator Bob Dole of Kansas lost both, and Michigan, four years ago.</p>
        <p>Representative Sander M. Levin, a Democrat whose district includes parts of both counties, said he thought that Mr. Gore had ''managed to hack his way through most of the thicket of negative Clinton associations, like Monica and Whitewater, which has allowed prosperity to pop through as the leading issue.'' In his area, he said, ''virtually everything has gotten better for most people, though not everyone, over the last eight years, from better schools to better race relations to considerably better pay and conditions on the job.''</p>
        <p>Twenty-five years ago, Mr. Levin said, only 10 percent of the children in Macomb County went to college, and their parents felt left out of the American success story. Now, more than half get degrees, he said, and their parents ''have joined the rest of us in the scramble of middle-income life.''</p>
        <p>Former Gov. William G. Milliken, a moderate Republican, said he thought that despite Mr. Bush's promise of ''compassionate conservatism,'' he was having trouble fitting into the pattern of economic conservatism and moderation on social issues that seems to succeed best in the suburbs. Specifically, Mr. Milliken mentioned as problems Mr. Bush's opposition to campaign-finance reform, as espoused by Senator McCain, and his steadfast opposition to abortion.</p>
        <p>Governor Engler ran Mr. Bush's campaign against Mr. McCain, promising to erect a firewall against the insurgent. He and the wall were torched. Now he is once again at the helm, with assistance from Warren K. Erdman, a former aide to Senator Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, who was sent into the state when Mr. Bush began slipping. But this time, Mr. Engler's profile is lower.</p>
        <p>Professor Rohde of Michigan State said the best the governor could do for Mr. Bush in any event is ''some small influence on the Republican turnout, roughly equal to the impact of the labor unions on the other side.''</p>
        <p>This week, Mr. Bush has promised larger public roles for, and better coordination with, Republican governors in two neighboring Midwest states -- Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin and Bob Taft of Ohio. But so far at least, there has been no evidence that he is planning to push Mr. Engler out front.</p>
        <p>''George Bush doesn't want to turn this into another referendum on a controversial governor,'' said Mr. Ballenger, the newsletter publisher, ''and pull the independents out to cast protest votes for Al Gore.''</p>
        <p>Already, a ballot proposal that would legalize the use of state funds for private and parochial schools through a system of vouchers has complicated the Michigan situation for the national Republican ticket.  Mr. Engler opposes vouchers, which has split Republican ranks wide open; Elisabeth DeVos, who strongly supports them, resigned as the state party chairman in order to back the campaign for the ballot initiative, which is known as Proposal 1.</p>
        <p>The Times/CBS poll shows two-to-one backing for vouchers. Private schools were explicitly prohibited from using them in a 1970 amendment to the state constitution. Television campaigns, pro and con, are just beginning, but the Roman Catholic Church, under Cardinal Adam Maida of Detroit, is said to have set aside $1.5 million to support the proposal.  Hundreds of thousands of yard signs have already been ordered by opponents of the proposal, so it seems inevitable that the issue will soon loom large in voters' minds.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cheney did not mention the subject in a speech in Troy on Wednesday, and Mr. Bush, an eager advocate of vouchers, is not expected to use the ''v-word'' here either.</p>
