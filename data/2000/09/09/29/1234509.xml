        <p>A major gift has transformed the University of Oklahoma into a repository of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings.</p>
        <p>Clara Weitzenhoffer, an art collector and longtime arts supporter who died in July, bequeathed her collection of 33 works, including 22 paintings and 11 works on paper by van Gogh, Degas, Gauguin and Monet. It is the largest collection of French Impressionist art ever given to a public American university.</p>

        <p>A major gift has transformed the University of Oklahoma into a repository of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings.</p>
        <p>Clara Weitzenhoffer, an art collector and longtime arts supporter who died in July, bequeathed her collection of 33 works, including 22 paintings and 11 works on paper by van Gogh, Degas, Gauguin and Monet. It is the largest collection of French Impressionist art ever given to a public American university.</p>
        <p>The collection was formed in the 1950's and 60's by Mrs. Weitzenhoffer and her husband, Aaron, a founder of the Davon Oil Company who died in 1960. They lived in Oklahoma City and La Jolla, Calif.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weitzenhoffer also gave the university her collection of 17th- and 18th-century furniture and decorative objects. The total gift is valued  at more than $50 million.</p>
        <p>Both the art and objects will eventually be on display in a new $10 million addition to the university Museum of Art in Norman, Okla. The addition, which is being designed by the Washington architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen, will not be completed for several years, but the collection will be displayed at the Museum of Art from Nov. 14 through Jan. 14.</p>
        <p>David L. Boren, former Oklahoma governor and senator and the president of the university, said that he  met Mrs. Weitzenhoffer through her son, A. Max Weitzenhoffer, a theater  producer and university alumnus, and that her son played a role in the gift. The highlights include a van Gogh portrait (circa 1886-88) of Alexander Reid, a British art dealer and  painter; Gauguin's ''Copenhagen'' (1886), a snowy street scene, in muted tones; Pissarro's ''Shepherdess Bringing In the Sheep'' (1886); and Monet's ''Riverbank at Lavacourt'' (1879).</p>
        <p>''Norman will become a destination,'' Mr. Boren said. ''We had 100,000 visitors in the first week when we opened our Natural History Museum this spring.'' Since 1994 the university has been working to improve its arts complex. The campus now has a new $16 million concert hall and the Charles M. Russell Center for the Study of Art of the American West.</p>
        <p>In planning the wing, Mr. Boren said, the museum has decided to recreate a series of period rooms. ''It will be a wonderful educational experience to see the paintings alongside the antiques and decorative objects,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Gift to New Museum</p>
        <p>Corporations are becoming more creative about their art collections. An example is Altoids, the maker of ''the curiously strong mints.'' A subsidiary of Philip Morris, a major supporter of the arts, Altoids has been quietly putting together a collection of works by emerging artists for three years.</p>
        <p>This week it announced that it had donated the entire collection of some 70 works to the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo.</p>
        <p>The collection, amassed with the help of a panel of arts professionals, features artworks by visual artists working in the United States, with each piece acquired for less than $2,500.</p>
        <p>Each year Altoids has presented its new acquisitions in a tour of five or six cities, including New York, Chicago and Miami. But Altoids decided it needed a permanent home for its growing collection where the public could view the artworks on a regular basis. Every time a tour ended, explained Andrew Burke, brand manager for Altoids, the company felt that the works needed more exposure.</p>
        <p>The donation is the first corporate gift to the New Museum as well as the biggest collection it has received.</p>
        <p>''We looked at a lot of places,'' said Mr. Burke. ''But the New Museum, we felt, was the best for trying to recognize these great artists.''</p>
        <p>The gift includes works by artists including Laylah Ali, D. L. Alvarez, Jessica Craig-Martin, Sam Durant Barry McGee and Dario Robleto. It is conservatively valued at $175,000, Altoids said</p>
        <p>The company plans to keep collecting -- buying 12 to 18 works a year -- and to keep organizing its tours. After each tour, the pieces will go to the museum. The arrangement is a five-year renewable commitment.</p>
        <p>Lisa Phillips, director of the New Museum, said she became acquainted with the Altoids company after she was asked to be on the company's selection panel. ''They've been really bold in their collecting,'' she said. ''It's a terrific collection that's been a well-kept secret.'' The works will go on view at the museum from Jan. 12 to 28.</p>
        <p>Into Jasper Johns</p>
        <p>With the completion of its new $50 million building designed by the architect Jose Rafael Moneo, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston is focusing on expanding its collection. It has made progress in strengthening its photography holdings and is now turning its attention to contemporary art.</p>
        <p>Among its latest acquisitions are Jasper Johns's ''Untitled (Red Yellow Blue)'' painting from 1984, six related etchings and a lithograph.</p>
        <p>The painting, which experts value  from $12 million to $15 million, was purchased from the artist with funds from the Brown Foundation in Houston.</p>
        <p>''We bought Johns's 'Ventriloquist' in 1984 from Leo Castelli and we have the related prints and drawings,'' said Peter C. Marzio, the museum's director. ''So we contacted Jasper Johns and said we wanted not just a paintings but work that showed its beginnings and its afterlife.''</p>
        <p>''Untitled (Red Yellow Blue)'' consists of three panels divided into horizontal sections and incorporates many of the artist's familiar motifs: stenciled letters, imprints of the artist's hand and a handkerchief suspended from two nails (in homage to the 19th-century American trompe l'oeil painter John Frederick Peto).</p>
        <p>The painting's surface is in the artist's signature encaustic, a technique involving pigment suspended in wax that Mr. Johns is frequently credited with reviving. The material sets rapidly and allows every brush stroke to remain distinct.</p>
        <p>The works will go on view toward the end of October, Mr. Marzio said.</p>
