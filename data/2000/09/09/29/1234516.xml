        <p>''I like to go to beautiful places, places that are nice and calm and quiet,'' says Nasia (Candace Evanofski) in ''George Washington.'' This dream of a movie is set in such a place; with its delicate shifts of tone, it could be a fairy tale by Faulkner. The picture is also bursting with talent, from its very young cast -- most of the actors are preteens to 14-year-olds -- to its first-time feature writer and director, David Gordon Green, who puts his trust in his ensemble. It comes through for him.</p>
        <p>The movie seems to be an antidote to the forced and gruesomely engineered kid comedies that exaggerate trite incidents in the protagonist's life. What Mr. Green does is slow down the pace and ease the film into the rhythms of the South, where nothing is hurried.

        <p>''I like to go to beautiful places, places that are nice and calm and quiet,'' says Nasia (Candace Evanofski) in ''George Washington.'' This dream of a movie is set in such a place; with its delicate shifts of tone, it could be a fairy tale by Faulkner. The picture is also bursting with talent, from its very young cast -- most of the actors are preteens to 14-year-olds -- to its first-time feature writer and director, David Gordon Green, who puts his trust in his ensemble. It comes through for him.</p>
        <p>The movie seems to be an antidote to the forced and gruesomely engineered kid comedies that exaggerate trite incidents in the protagonist's life. What Mr. Green does is slow down the pace and ease the film into the rhythms of the South, where nothing is hurried. (It was filmed in North Carolina, an area that's both lush and run down, where hunks of rusting metal compete with the glowing greens of the landscape.)</p>
        <p>In one scene, Buddy (Curtis Cotton III) stands in a decrepit auditorium wearing a rubber dinosaur mask and delivering a soliloquy, and you may be put in mind of the wonderful details and distinctive timing that Bill Forsyth lent to his best work, ''Gregory's Girl'' and ''Local Hero.'' But it's not simply imitative; in his debut Mr. Green has found a style that's defiantly his own.</p>
        <p>''George Washington,'' which will be shown tonight and Sunday at the New York Film Festival, is essentially plotless but lively and inviting nonetheless. The cinematographer Tim Orr has accomplished something remarkable: the African-American children seem to have been lighted from within, and their skin has a slight burnished glow, as if the sun is deftly tracing across their bodies. (Mr. Orr emerges as a star as well. This may be the best-photographed film of the year; it's not ostentatious or showy, and the look helps create a sense of place.)</p>
        <p>It helps, too, that Mr. Green has chosen a group of new young players who don't have the antic need to ingratiate that is often found in child actors who compete for face time. Instead, each is different, and what  appears to be idle, sporadic chatter is character revelation.</p>
        <p>George (Donald Holden, who resembles a young Branford Marsalis when he is still, which is often) is slightly closed off and doesn't reveal everything about himself for the camera. That could be why Nasia has fallen for him, because his self-containment makes him seem so full of possibility. He's constantly picking up animals -- he adopts a smelly stray dog and plays with a wet ferret while in church watching his little sister rehearse with the choir. George seems to relate to these animals because he's a scrubby loner -- he can't be immersed in water because of a skull condition; the water could irritate his brain and kill him. So he wears a football helmet to protect himself.</p>
        <p>The African-American girls, talking matter of factly about affairs of the heart as they work on one another's hair, are hilarious; their engrossing self-esteem is simply there for us to observe. We get the same thing with the boys as they discuss diving and belly-flop technique, while in the background one of them climbs a wall and hangs from a hook. The last time a director captured this kind of life so well on screen was when Spike Lee made ''She's Gotta Have It.''</p>
        <p>Nasia narrates the film, and Ms. Evanofski has the natural grace and charisma of someone born to sit in front of the camera, teasing it as it tries to get to the heart of her talent. She's the center of a love triangle with George and Buddy, whom she breaks up with at the beginning of the movie. ''She dumped me last week at church; she had this glaze in her eyes that made me tingle all over,'' Buddy rhapsodizes.</p>
        <p>The movie takes the characters as seriously as they take themselves, and adults and kids have conversations as if there were no boundaries between them. The kids are given to spinning philosophies and wrestling with the need to express themselves, and they aren't all as naturally articulate as Nasia. The beefy Vernon (Damian Jewan Lee) commiserates with Sonya (Rachael Handy), his ambitious partner in auto theft, and Mr. Green plays with the contrast: she's a reed-thin blond white girl of about 9. And these child lovers talk about the politics of relationships as if they've been having them for years.</p>
        <p>Like a Faulkner tale, ''George Washington'' takes a dark turn, but no one is punished for the sake of melodrama. There's nothing tawdry about the bumps in the characters' lives, and regret darkens the souls of all involved. Mr. Green's adults are sometimes crankier than the children and less aware of their feelings. George and his sister live with his Uncle Damascus (Eddie Rouse), whose anger keeps him from holding a job and whose hatred of animals makes George nervous. Damascus seems to be the opposite of the somber, sensitive George, but it turns out that he wants to do good as much as his nephew but lacks the ability to express himself.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Lee, Mr. Green is especially able to construct scenes with men struggling to be in command of a conversation. There are several among railroad workers, including the oddball Rico (well played by Paul Schneider, who doesn't overemphasize the goofiness), that are a loving tribute to the Southern penchant for wasting time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green has a sense of proportion and taste. No scene goes on for a beat longer than it should. And his  world is so believable despite its period influence -- no one uses profanity -- that children are bound to be swept into its generous expanse.</p>
        <p>Nasia believes that George is the key to her future and the world's future as well -- she calls him George Washington -- and she makes him worthy of being the picture's focal point by fixing her amber eyes and sassy intensity on him. ''I hope you live forever,'' she tells George and, thanks to her and this movie, he will.</p>
