        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Giants (3-1) at Tennesse (2-1)  On the surface this looks like a loss for the Giants. Tennessee is seeking its 10th consecutive victory at Adelphia Coliseum. Quarterback Steve McNair has almost fully recovered from a bruised sternum and running back Eddie George is one of the most intimidating offensive players in football. But here is why the Giants will win: Tennessee makes its living running the ball, and the Giants defense has enough quickness and toughness on defense to slow down George. The Giants(TM) weakest link, the secondary, won't be challenged by a passing offense, in which the tight end is the leading receiver. Giants, 15-13</p>
        <p>MONDAY 9 P.M.</p>
        <p>Seattle (2-2) at Kansas City (2-2)  It is always difficult to win at Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs are still euphoric after their sizzling victory at Denver last week. Kansas City quarterback Elvis Grbac, 11-6 as a starter against division opponents, is playing well now. He(TM)s the difference. Chiefs, 18-10</p>

Kansas City quarterback Elvis Grbac, 11-6 as a starter against division opponents, is playing well now. He(TM)s the difference. Chiefs, 18-10</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Indianapolis (2-1) at Buffalo (2-1)  After the 43-14 pasting Peyton Manning put on a pretty good Jacksonville team last week, the Colts made a major statement to the rest of the league: The Rams and Buccaneers are good, but so are we. They would make an even bigger statement by traveling to Buffalo and beating the Bills, which will be difficult, but will happen, mainly because Buffalo doesn't have the offense to keep up. The game will be extremely close because Buffalo has good corners and speedy linebackers and has won 8 of 9 at home against the A.F.C. East. But the feeling is that Indianapolis is on a roll. Colts, 16-13</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:05 P.M.</p>
        <p>New England (0-4) at Denver (2-2)  Denver quarterback Brian Griese has postponed possible shoulder surgery until the end of the season, which is good news for the Broncos. That is, if the shoulder holds up. His backup, Gus Frerotte, is terrible. If Griese plays the entire game, Denver wins. If not, the Patriots get a much-needed victory. Broncos, 22-14</p>
        <p>Chicago (0-4) at Green Bay (2-2)  The problem with the Bears is they don't know what they want to do offensively. The scheme sometimes resembles that of a Division 1-AA team -- lots of misdirection and trick plays. In other words, it is a pubescent West Coast offense. Whatever happened to simply running the football up the middle? In eight home games against Chicago, Brett Favre has averaged a 97.3 passer rating and owns a 6-2 record. Packers, 20-13</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>San Diego (0-4) at St. Louis (4-0)  The numbers St. Louis is putting up are stunning. The offense has scored 30-plus points in 10 straight games -- an N.F.L. record. The Rams have scored 160 points and are on pace for 640, which would shatter the league record set by Minnesota in 1998 by 84 points. Kurt Warner has thrown for four consecutive 300-yard games. With all due respect to the Chargers and their good little defense, the team has no chance against that kind of firepower. Rams, 35-16</p>
        <p>Baltimore (3-1) at Cleveland (2-2)  Entering the season, many felt quarterback Tony Banks was the weak link for the Ravens. Banks is changing people's minds. He has won 7 of his last 9 starts and has been a mature, patient leader that the team respects. The Ravens' defense is finally coming around after a rough start. It has not allowed a 100-yard rusher in the past 21 games -- tops in the conference. This season Baltimore has allowed a league-low five trips to the red-zone. Ravens, 28-6</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:05 P.M.</p>
        <p>Miami (3-1) at Cincinnati (0-3)  At 63, Cincinnati interim coach Dick LeBeau is the oldest rookie head coach in 30 years. Unfortunately for LeBeau, there is no time to celebrate. He has a lot of work to do with a team that is in disarray after the resignation (mercy killing?) of Coach Bruce Coslet. Miami has allowed 22 total points while Cincinnati has scored a total of only 7. This game is ugly, ugly, ugly. Dolphins, 25-6</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Dallas (1-3) at Carolina (1-2)  The smart yet cold-hearted thing to do with a Cowboys offense that is melting down would be to bench quarterback Troy Aikman and start Randall Cunningham. Aikman is a champion and future Hall of Famer, and he deserves respect, but the harsh truth is the offense flows better with Cunningham at the helm. Carolina, after a disappointing start, is due for a breakout game. This is the week it happens. Panthers, 21-13</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh (0-3) at Jacksonville (2-2)  Pittsburgh quarterback Kent Graham is hurting all over with all kinds of sore body parts. Expect to see Kordell Stewart at some point. The Steelers will take advantage of the Jaguars cornerbacks, playing the worst pass defense in the conference. But Jacksonville is dominant at home and prevails. Jaguars, 28-12</p>
        <p>Minnesota (3-0) at Detroit (3-1)  Quarterback Daunte Culpepper is for real. So are the Vikings. The offense is clicking as usual, but it is the defense that is the surprise. The Vikings are allowing 300.3 yards per game -- no, they aren't the Buccaneers -- but that number is down from 373.7 yards a game through three games last season. The Vikings' defense keeps the Lions in check. Minnesota Coach Dennis Green's three-year contract extension gives the Vikings an emotional edge. Vikings, 28-21</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:05 P.M.</p>
        <p>Arizona (1-2) at San Francisco (1-3)  49ers wide receiver Terrell Owens says he was praying when he twice ran to midfield last week after scoring touchdowns against Dallas. Lame excuse. Owens's hot-dogging overshadowed two things. First, San Francisco quarterback Jeff Garcia is playing well, and has four, multi-touchdown games in his past five, and has a passer rating of 100.6, second in the conference. And Owens has three touchdowns in his past two games. The 49ers will miss him: he has been suspended for last week's taunts 49ers, 28-17</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 8:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>Atlanta (2-2) at Philadelphia (2-2)  Yawn. Boring game. The Falcons will run the ball until Jamal Anderson can't run any more and then will see lots of Eagles running back Duce Staley. The Eagles have the better defense. That's why they win. Eagles, 21-14</p>
        <p>GAME WEEK OF THE WEEK  SUNDAY 4:15 P.M.</p>
        <p>Buccaneers 3-1 Redskins 2-2  The Buccaneers lose to the Jets and all of a sudden Tampa Bay is the Cincinnati Bengals. Everyone relax. The Buccaneers are still a Super Bowl-caliber team. Still, they will have a difficult time at Washington because the Redskins are feeling more confident. Linebacker LaVar Arrington gets the start and will make some plays, as will quarterback Brad Johnson. But this is a bad week to play Tampa Bay. The players are angry, especially the defense, and feel they have something to prove. Buccaneers, 20-12</p>
        <p>Jets, Oakland and New Orleans do not play this week. All times Eastern.</p>
