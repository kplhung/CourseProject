        <p>Hallmarks of suburban life in Nas sau County  pristine parks, swimming pools and baseball fields -- would suffer in myriad ways under County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta's budget proposal, the head of the Department of Parks and Recreation told county lawmakers today.</p>
        <p>As if that were not enough to depress residents at a crowded legislative budget hearing, a county fiscal analyst then said that Mr. Gulotta's 2001 budget plan included enough money to clear only two snowfalls.</p>
        <p>''If we, by chance, have two severe storms this winter, we don't have enough money to plow the roads,'' said Mark Young, the financial adviser to the County Legislature.</p>
        <p>The bad news began when John Kiernan, an 11-year commissioner of the Department of Parks and Recreation who will retire soon, said that whoever succeeded him would face tough decisions: whether to abandon or close some of the county's 19 parks and 11 pools; how tall to let the  grass grow, and which of the 300 county buildings will get the use, on any given day, of the department's sole plumber or painter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiernan said park services for 1.3 million residents would change drastically because roughly 120 departmental employees are expected to retire early, take a severance package or be laid off, trimming a  work force that numbered 888 people a decade ago to about 225.</p>
        <p>Things are no better in the Department of General Services. In vivid testimony, its deputy commissioner, William K. Long, said Mr. Gulotta's proposed budget would leave the department with just 274 full-time employees, a 64 percent reduction in personnel since 1988, and would leave it $1 million short for fuel to heat county buildings.</p>
        <p>''Have we looked into handing out sweaters?'' Jeffrey Toback, a Democrat and the chairman of the legislative Government Services Committee, asked Mr. Long.</p>
        <p>''No, we haven't,'' Mr. Long replied.</p>
        <p>After the hearing, Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the County Legislature, vowed to avoid as many of the proposed cuts as possible, mainly by proposing a steeper property tax increase than the 4 percent Mr. Gulotta has proposed for next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiernan said an average tax increase of $22 per household would keep park services at the same or even better levels. He asked Judy Goldstein, a resident who criticized the service cuts, if she would be willing to pay that much.</p>
        <p>''Yes, yes, yes,'' she said.</p>
