        <p>The B Com3 Group in Chicago said yesterday that it would reorganize management of its largest agency networks, Leo Burnett Worldwide in Chicago and D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles Worldwide in New York.</p>

Ms. Wolf also takes the title of chairwoman at Burnett; Richard B. Fizdale, 61, who had been chairman at Burnett, continues as vice chairman at B Com3.</p>
        <p>Robert C. Brennan, 41, chief operating officer at the Starcom MediaVest Group, the media services unit of B Com3, becomes president at Burnett, responsible for North America.
