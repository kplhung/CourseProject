        <p>Udomsak Krisanamis, who immigrated to the United States from Thailand in 1991, may be the Frank Stella of current painting. He started out in the mid-1990's with widely admired, physically distinctive black-and-white abstractions that reduced painting to ground zero. His working process -- combining East and West, art and craft, real and abstract, chance and plan -- entailed making collages of newsprint and then blacking out everything except the O's and zeroes, initially, with a felt-tip pen. The resulting paintings were as mind-bogglingly straightforward in conception as they were mesmerizing in effect -- evoking star-clogged night skies, twinkling cityscapes and blinking digital universes.</p>

        <p>Udomsak Krisanamis, who immigrated to the United States from Thailand in 1991, may be the Frank Stella of current painting. He started out in the mid-1990's with widely admired, physically distinctive black-and-white abstractions that reduced painting to ground zero. His working process -- combining East and West, art and craft, real and abstract, chance and plan -- entailed making collages of newsprint and then blacking out everything except the O's and zeroes, initially, with a felt-tip pen. The resulting paintings were as mind-bogglingly straightforward in conception as they were mesmerizing in effect -- evoking star-clogged night skies, twinkling cityscapes and blinking digital universes.</p>
        <p>But like Mr. Stella of the late 1960's or Brice Marden in the mid-1970's, Mr. Krisanamis has had to face the challenge of what next, knowing that the only way is up, toward greater physical and pictorial complexity. His third solo show, like his second, is transitional. His solution is, again, to do the same, only more, creating deeper, more layered suggestions of space with surfaces more heavily encrusted with self-referential materials (Thai noodles and snippets of his psychedelic 1997 exhibition poster) and with thicker, more colorful paint.</p>
        <p>Big open grids suggesting city streets or plaids dominate these compositions, but it is the myriad detail -- the constant shifts in color, texture, pattern and spatial depth --- that rule. What's missing is the startling gap between, to paraphrase Mr. Stella, what you see and what you get, between the stupefying mundanity of the actual surface and its dazzling visual effect. The new paintings are much the same at any distance, which is incredibly rich and complex, but also more conventionally abstract.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krisanamis's means remain distinctive, personal, culturally suggestive and full of possibility. But at least for the moment, the visual effect is not nearly as clearly his own.</p>
