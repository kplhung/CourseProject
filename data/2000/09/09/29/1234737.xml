        <p>A rubber track surrounds it, and steel beams criss-cross the ceiling. Seton Hall's fieldhouse is nothing special, but for P.J. Carlesimo it contains the fondest memory of his 12-season reign as a coach.</p>
        <p>Thousands gathered there on April 5, 1989, to welcome Carlesimo and his Pirates home after their improbable run in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament ended with an 80-79 overtime defeat to Michigan in the championship game. Last night, hundreds gathered in the fieldhouse to honor Carlesimo and Seton Hall basketball players.</p>
        <p>The 51-year-old Carlesimo, who was married in July and is now the co-owner of a restaurant in San Francisco, is a color broadcaster for the San Antonio Spurs and ESPN. But he said he wants to coach again, preferably in the pros. This was his first return to the campus in South Orange, N.J., in seven years. He was fired after three seasons as coach of the Portland Trail Blazers despite a winning record, then spent two-and-a-half tumultuous years with Golden State.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 1, 1997, Latrell Sprewell choked him during a practice, and the Warriors terminated Sprewell's contract. Sprewell was later traded to the Knicks, and Carlesimo was fired last December after compiling a 46-113 record with the Warriors. Carlesimo said the incident was something he and Sprewell were happy to put behind them. ''I think at some point in the future, Latrell and I will get a chance to someday maybe sit down and talk,'' he said. ''If it does happen, it will certainly happen in a one-on-one, in a setting away from other people's eyes and ears.''</p>
