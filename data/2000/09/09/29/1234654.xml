        <p>The Mets are not used to relaxing. Sometimes they press, sometimes they focus, but not since the end of the 1997 season had the Mets been able to kick back and play ball for the heck of it. With nothing on the line last night, the Mets had no trouble beating the best pitcher of this generation.</p>
        <p>The Mets clinched the National League wild-card berth on Wednesday, so four everyday players took last night off. Two other starters are out with minor injuries. A sold-out crowd of 52,134 at Shea Stadium paid to see the Mets' bench try to hit the Atlanta Braves' Greg Maddux. They left the park happy for the privilege.</p>
        <p>With Maddux trying to win his 20th game and build on a lengthy streak of scoreless innings, the Mets' reserves knocked him out after five innings, en route to an 8-2 victory. Todd Pratt drove in three runs, Darryl Hamilton had two hits, Timo Perez scored twice and Kurt Abbott hit a two-run homer, in the sixth.</p>
        <p>''Guys are not as uptight,'' Hamilton said. ''You have a good time out there. If you give up a run, you just say: 'So what? We'll go try to get it back.' It's definitely more relaxed when the clinching process is over.''</p>
        <p>The Mets did give up the first run of the game, and it did not matter. They scored three times in the fourth inning off Maddux (19-9), giving the right-hander Bobby J. Jones all the support he needed. Jones worked eight innings, allowing two runs (one earned) to improve to 11-6. The strong effort could complicate the Mets' decision about who will be their fourth starter in the division series against St. Louis or San Francisco.</p>
        <p>The Mets almost certainly will use four starters; if they don't, two starters would have to pitch on short rest in a five-game series. General Manager Steve Phillips, Manager Bobby Valentine and the coaching staff will meet today to discuss plans for the playoff roster and rotation, and one question they will ponder is whether Jones or Glendon Rusch will get a turn.</p>
        <p>''That's something that I have no control over, so why worry about it?'' Jones said. ''I'm just thrilled to be a part of a playoff team. Last year, my injury kept me out of it.''</p>
        <p>This year, the worst slump of his career nearly did. Jones, who had bursitis in his shoulder last year, had a 10.19 earned run average after eight starts this season. Since accepting an assignment to Class AAA Norfolk, Jones is 10-3 with a 3.69 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>''Bobby's a very good pitcher who I think is capable of winning a game any time of the season,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Valentine, whose team was eliminated from playoff contention on the final day in 1998 and clinched a playoff spot in a one-game tie breaker last year, rested shortstop Mike Bordick, catcher Mike Piazza, third baseman Robin Ventura and first baseman Todd Zeile last night. Two outfielders -- Derek Bell (bruised left knee) and Benny Agbayani (strained right hamstring) -- also sat.</p>
        <p>Lenny Harris, who started at first base, said Jones must have been dejected when he saw the lineup. ''I might have to take one for the team,'' Harris imagined Jones saying. But the backups -- a collection Harris calls the Terror Squad because they are terrible to be around in the dugout -- came through.</p>
        <p>The Braves scored in the second, aided by a ground ball that squibbed out of Harris's glove for an error. The 1-0 lead looked like enough for Maddux, who came in with 36 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings and needed 26 pitches to set down the first nine Mets.</p>
        <p>But Perez, who sparked two rallies on Wednesday, drew a leadoff walk in the fourth and was running when Hamilton rolled a grounder to second. Keith Lockhart was covering the bag and could not get Hamilton's grounder, and Perez went to third. He scored on an infield single by Harris, and Pratt knocked in two with a single, putting the Mets up by 3-1.</p>
        <p>Perez walked with one out in the fifth, advanced to third again on a Hamilton single and scored on an error by shortstop Rafael Furcal. There would be no victory party for Maddux.</p>
        <p>''It was easy to get up for tonight's game, when Maddux was going for 20,'' said Hamilton, who is 7 for 13 against the four-time Cy Young award winner.</p>
        <p>Perez climbed from Class A to the majors this year, and he has made an impression, especially since Agbayani was injured last Friday. In four games since, Perez has scored 7 runs, with 5 hits in 16 at-bats.</p>
        <p>But Agbayani, the regular leadoff hitter, is progressing well. He took batting practice yesterday without pain, and said he will be ready for the start of the playoffs. When asked if Perez's performance could have an impact on Agbayani's playing time, Valentine said: ''I don't know; I don't think so. Darryl's playing, too, and Benny looks like he's coming around.''</p>
        <p>The Mets have three regular-season games left, against Montreal at Shea, then take two days off before their playoff series starts on Wednesday. A reunion with the Braves awaits if both teams win their first-round series.</p>
        <p>While Atlanta took the season series from the Mets, 7-6, the Mets were encouraged by their strong finish. If it helps them break the Braves' spell, last night's game may have meant something after all.</p>
        <p>''We look at it as three of the last four, because we won the last game at Turner Field last week,'' Hamilton said. ''Getting that kind of monkey off our back with the Braves gives us some added confidence if we play them again in the playoffs.''</p>
