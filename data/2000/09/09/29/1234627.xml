        <p>Slobodan Milosevic's resounding defeat in Yugoslavia's presidential elections is being celebrated by large and joyous crowds around the country. Yesterday Serbia's Orthodox Church joined most of Yugoslavia's political parties, President Clinton and leaders across Europe in recognizing the election of the opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica. Regrettably, Mr. Milosevic himself does not yet seem to have gotten the message. His allies in the government-controlled election commission have brazenly shaved just enough votes off Mr. Kostunica's winning margin to call for a runoff vote next month. That insults democracy and invites  political turmoil. The international community, including Russia, must firmly insist that Mr. Milosevic step aside now.</p>
        <p>The most reliable vote count comes from opposition poll watchers who observed the official ballot tabulation at almost every voting place in Yugoslavia. Adding up the local tally sheets, each signed by observers from all major parties, shows Mr. Kostunica with a clear majority of 52.54 percent, enough to avoid a runoff, with only 35.01 percent going to Mr. Milosevic.</p>

        <p>Slobodan Milosevic's resounding defeat in Yugoslavia's presidential elections is being celebrated by large and joyous crowds around the country. Yesterday Serbia's Orthodox Church joined most of Yugoslavia's political parties, President Clinton and leaders across Europe in recognizing the election of the opposition candidate, Vojislav Kostunica. Regrettably, Mr. Milosevic himself does not yet seem to have gotten the message. His allies in the government-controlled election commission have brazenly shaved just enough votes off Mr. Kostunica's winning margin to call for a runoff vote next month. That insults democracy and invites  political turmoil. The international community, including Russia, must firmly insist that Mr. Milosevic step aside now.</p>
        <p>The most reliable vote count comes from opposition poll watchers who observed the official ballot tabulation at almost every voting place in Yugoslavia. Adding up the local tally sheets, each signed by observers from all major parties, shows Mr. Kostunica with a clear majority of 52.54 percent, enough to avoid a runoff, with only 35.01 percent going to Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The opposition count has been endorsed by Washington and leading European governments. Similar results have been announced by Yugoslavia's leading independent vote monitoring group and even by some parties previously allied with Mr. Milosevic. But early yesterday morning the election commission announced a total of 48.96 percent for Mr. Kostunica and 38.62 for Mr. Milosevic. Producing those figures required disqualifying several hundred thousand voters and dispensing with the legal requirement of reconciling the commission's numbers with the tally sheet totals compiled by the opposition. If these cooked numbers are allowed to stand, neither candidate would have the 50 percent needed for a first-round victory, forcing an Oct. 8 runoff.</p>
        <p>The opposition has rightly refused to accept this latest attempted manipulation by the Milosevic camp. New balloting would give the beleaguered dictator time to regroup and once more try to steal victory through systematic vote-rigging and violent repression. Instead Mr. Kostunica has summoned his supporters to the streets to defend his victory, and plans to call for civil disobedience. Hundreds of thousands of Yugoslavs have already rallied in Belgrade and other major cities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic is understandably desperate to cling to power. Out of office, he might find it harder to avoid eventual trial before an international war crimes tribunal for his treatment of Kosovo's Albanians. But he should not be allowed to take Yugoslavia down with him. An attempt to prolong his rule by further electoral fraud could produce unrest, even violence, making it difficult for Yugoslavia to end its economic and political isolation from the rest of Europe.</p>
        <p>Russia, which has traditionally seen itself as the protector of Yugoslavia's people, has thus far stood apart from European demands for Mr. Milosevic's immediate departure. Moscow should now make clear to him that the Yugoslav people have voted him out of power and he must yield.</p>
