        <p>Because of Rosh Hashana this weekend, several public high school football games in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were played yesterday rather than on Saturday.</p>
        <p>But the day of the week did not seem to matter much to Edgemont (4-0), as the Panthers cruised to a 61-0 victory over Irvington (1-3) at Irvington.</p>
        <p>Edgemont, the two-time defending Class C champions in New York State, did most of its damage in the first half, sprinting to a 42-0 halftime lead.</p>
        <p>Joey Tarasiewicz (5 carries for 232 yards, 3 touchdowns), Matt Bernstein (17 carries for 190 yards, 2 touchdowns) and Jessie Brooks (4 carries for 142 yards, 2 touchdowns) combined for 574 rushing yards.</p>
        <p>Joe Olsen returned an interception 65 yards and Alex Bernstein, Matt's younger brother, returned one 55 yards.</p>
        <p>Two 100-yard rushers helped Suffern (2-2) to a 21-7 victory over Saunders Tech of Yonkers, which is 0-4.</p>
        <p>Brian Williams, a senior running back, carried 12 times for 123 yards and scored on a 50-yard pitch around left end.</p>
        <p>Tom Murphy, a sophomore runner, carried 17 times for 112 yards and dived into the end zone from a yard out. The junior fullback Gabe Perez scored Suffern's other touchdown on a 5-yard run.</p>
        <p>Defensively, Suffern was led by Bart Simmons, a senior captain, who had four tackles for losses, including two sacks. He also forced two fumbles and deflected a pass.</p>
        <p>In a Nassau County game, the Garden City Trojans (3-0) defeated MacArthur (1-2), 26-14, at MacArthur.</p>
        <p>In his first game back from an ankle injury, Dave Kang, a senior quarterback, completed four of six passes for 113 yards, including two scoring passes of 27 and 57 yards to Chris Gumiela. John Birgner scored both touchdowns for MacArthur on a 50-yard punt return and a 60-yard run.</p>
        <p>In Suffolk County, John Glenn (2-1), behind three touchdowns by Onyi Momah and a 146-yard rushing performance by Jimmy Gradis, defeated visiting Bayport (1-2), 26-15.</p>
        <p>Momah, who rushed for 136 yards on 21 carries, scored on runs of 10, 21 and 9 yards. He also had 10 tackles as an outside linebacker. Gradis had 13 tackles.</p>
        <p>The Commack Cougars (3-0) kept their undefeated season alive as they defeated Central Islip (1-2), 26-6. The Cougars, playing at home, set the pace on their first possession, driving 80 yards on 12 plays before Clint Riggs ran it in from a yard out.</p>
        <p>On Commack's next possession, the Cougars put together another long drive, this time for 83 yards, capped by Jeff Dena's 2-yard run.</p>
        <p>Commack's next touchdown came in the third quarter when Michael Prahalis passed to Bryan Tornee for 33 yards. The Cougars put the game away when Noah Gottlieb recovered an onside kick after Dena's touchdown in the third quarter. Two plays later, Prahalis connected with Tornee from 18 yards out.</p>
