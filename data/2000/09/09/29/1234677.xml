        <p>Cisco Systems said yesterday that it had acquired two privately held communications companies to expedite its efforts to deliver voice over data networks. Vovida Networks is a supplier of networking protocols and communications software. IPCell Technologies provides software for broadband networks. By enabling it to combine voice, video and data services over packet networks, the acquisitions will help decrease network costs and generate new revenue for network service providers, Cisco said. The two deals were valued at $369 million in Cisco common stock.</p>
