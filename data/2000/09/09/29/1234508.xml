        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly un related vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical, it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form as ''Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all familiar with (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 student rush at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''GORE VIDAL'S 'THE BEST MAN.' '' Whatever the weaknesses of this unsteady revival, it definitely makes you wish that Mr. Vidal were writing the dialogue for the forthcoming, much-debated presidential debates. Despite the notoriously short shelf life of satire in the theater, this 1960 morality tale of a national political convention still rings with the whip cracks of abiding worldly wisdom dispensed in quips. At its best the play brings to the back-stabbing world of campaigning some of the fiery verbal artifice that the movies ''All About Eve'' and ''The Sweet Smell of Success'' brought to the back-stabbing worlds of show business and journalism. Unfortunately, what those movies have that this production does not is a rousing, melodramatic vigor. Led by Charles Durning, Spalding Gray and Christopher Noth, under the direction of Ethan McSweeney, the starry ensemble often feels frustratingly tentative. Despite fine work from Mr. Gray, Mr. Durning and Michael Learned, the show lacks the necessary conviction to be big (2:20). Virginia, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 to $75 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''KISS ME, KATE'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it is entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER.'' This revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's 1939 farce, starring Nathan Lane in a role famously modeled on Alexander Woollcott, feels busy without being lively. Under the direction of Jerry Zaks, the production seems to exist in neither the then nor the now. Much of the acting is a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes without being anchored to character or context. And Mr. Lane, looking like a cuddly Mattel-made Sigmund Freud doll in his beard and spectacles, never quite comes up with a coherent performance; it's as if he is still experimenting with his options. Tony Walton's richly colored set is a showroom-perfect evocation of period style that fits nicely into the newly restored American Airlines Theater (formerly the Selwyn). But the evening's most authentic glimpses into a vanished era of madcap celebrities are provided by Lewis J. Stadlen, in a character inspired by Harpo Marx, and Byron Jennings, as a charming Noel Cowardesque narcissist. Unfortunately their appearances onstage feel as brief and brilliant as lightning (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $70, half-price for children 18 and under; very limited (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>+ ''THE CRUMPLE ZONE.'' This new play by Buddy Thomas is uneven, but it has a lot going for it: a nicely structured plot about a gay household with a love triangle coming to crisis, sequences of physical comedy that are antic without being overblown into slapstick and an effective set that evokes a pleasantly chintzy apartment on Staten Island. Most of all, though, it has a bristling, funny performance by Mario Cantone, who plays the squeaky wheel, a clamorously lonely man on the outside of the triangle looking in. Mr. Cantone is known for his high-pitched stand-up comedy work, and he knows how to take over a room. In this case the room is a tiny apartment, but he works it as a diva would. He is the kind of actor who seems most in control when he's in a tizzy, with a voice that easily and naturally runs up to shrill. But this is not a shrill performance. Even in high dudgeon there's no tension in Mr. Cantone's face or his body language, just the wicked glee of a man who loves to seize the spotlight. The magnitude of his neurotic charisma in such a small space gives his character the hilariously keening pathos that makes the play work (2:00). Rattlestick, 224 Waverly Place, near West 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 206-1515. Mondays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $39 to $45 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>''IT AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT THE BLUES.'' This slick musical revue, a Tony nominee in 1999, has been slimmed down to a supper-club-brisk 80 minutes in its new cabaret home, but its strength remains in its high spirits and the marvelous voices on display. The six performers are the happiest blues singers you'll ever see -- it's thematic that the show begins and ends with ''Let the Good Times Roll'' -- and each brings a full throat and a flawless sense of pitch to standards like ''I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,'' ''I Put a Spell on You'' and ''I Can't Stop Lovin' You.'' Showbiz values keep things cheerful and the performers on a strict leash, and as a result longtime blues fans may miss the music's mordant spirit, its down and dirty heart. There's a blues-lite feel to the evening that wouldn't suit a roadhouse, but it's perfectly apt here: the blues for the new Times Square (1:20). B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>*+ ''JITNEY.'' ''Don't put your business in the street,'' advises a character in this splendidly acted production of August Wilson's early comic drama about a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh. As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays about the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where private business is always on parade: real life is always the best show in town. ''Jitney,'' which has been revised since its first production in 1982, could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality and is rendered with such stylish detail that a complete urban symphony emerges. There are occasional whiffs of melodrama. But under Marion McClinton's sensitive direction, every performer shines as a soloist and as a member of the chorus. It's the finest ensemble work of last season (2:35). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* ''BOXING 2000.'' Like many artists of his generation, the young writer-director Richard Maxwell is a connoisseur of cliches. None of the nine characters in his latest work, a deliberately listless story of amateur prize fighting, have anything remotely fresh to say. Their conversations, if you overheard them in a supermarket, would inspire glum thoughts that people as a whole are not an interesting species. Yet Mr. Maxwell, who achieves his distinctive tone as much through his direction (of a mostly nonprofessional cast) as his writing, is listening hard to his characters and demands that we do, too. By slowing down rhythms of speech and inflating pauses, he parses the banalities of everyday talk and finds the whispering fear and confusion beneath. His somnambulistic characters paradoxically generate a wide-awake energy, the quickened, hopeful heartbeat that comes from seeing a genuinely original talent at work (1:00). Present Company Theatorium, 198 Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 420-8877. Through tomorrow. Tonight and tomorrow at 8. Tickets: $15 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''LYPSINKA! THE BOXED SET.'' At a moment when models in fashion magazines are looking more and more like Stepford wives, here is Lypsinka anatomizing feminine artifice -- and its dangers -- like no one else.  The alter ego of a man named John Epperson, Lypsinka has always been something more than the usual drag act, not just another instance of a boy who enjoys being a girl. Instead, this enameled creature, who moves her mouth to artfully arranged recordings of songs and movie dialogue, shows a gimlet eye for the mechanics of the feminine mystique as manufactured in the mid-20th century. In ''Boxed Set,'' a sort of ''greatest hits'' show, the star again demonstrates the supreme physical control of a Balanchine dancer and a funny, troubling sense of how women can be prisoners of their images (2:00). Westbeth, 151 Bank Street, West Village, (212) 206-1515. Through tomorrow. Tonight and tomorrow at 8:30. Tickets: $27.50 to $32.50 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''RICHARD II'' AND ''CORIOLANUS.'' Unlike many movie stars, Ralph Fiennes doesn't shrink as a presence onstage. Indeed, those who know him largely through his subtle, inward work on film may be jolted by the brazenly exterior performances he is giving as Shakespeare's most peevish tragic heroes in these productions from the Almeida Theater of London. The actor's signature moodiness is certainly in evidence, but stylized, enlarged and spotlighted, as if part of some public monument. His energy, charisma and command of language are formidable. But while you know what he's trying to convey -- the signals go off like flares -- you don't necessarily feel it. The productions themselves, staged by Jonathan Kent, are strong in their pacing and accessibility, and crisply register Shakespeare's vision of the harsh vagaries of politics. But deeper interpretive revelations are faint, as is any sure emotional grip. The productions engage your interest, but they don't hold it captive. The supporting cast notably features Barbara Jefford, who is magnificent as a dragon of a Roman matron in ''Coriolanus'' (3:10 each). Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100. Through Sunday. ''Richard II'': Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m. ''Coriolanus'': Today at 7:30 p.m.; tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $75; very limited. Returned tickets at box office 90 minutes before curtain (Brantley).</p>
