        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio today sought to rebut the perception that he has been too upbeat in the face of economic suffering upstate, asserting before the Rotary Club here that new jobs are being created while acknowledging that ''the recovery here has not reached every single family.''</p>
        <p>Addressing the group a week after his opponent in the Senate race, Hillary Rodham Clinton, told it that Mr. Lazio was out of touch, he stuck close to a stance that has generated some debate upstate and has led even some fellow Republicans to question his approach.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Lazio heard Joel A. Giambra, the Erie County executive and a Republican, present brighter figures on the economy that buttressed the more cautious ''we're not out of the woods yet'' view he gave to a newspaper last week. Today, Mr. Giambra said that while ''boosterism is not going to solve the economic problems here,'' the ''fiscal free fall has stopped'' with the net gain of 11,000 jobs in the past 18 months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, noting the statistics, said, ''It is symptomatic of a dynamic economy -- of an economy that's changing, that's flexible, that's adapting, that in the end that is growing.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I know the recovery here has not reached every single family. I know there is still a lot of work to do, and I know that the next senator of New York will need to be a leader of that effort. But the question is: Do we want to build on our recent accomplishments or do we want to return to the policies that caused the recessions in the first place?''</p>
        <p>In the end, however, Mr. Lazio did not lay out a plan aimed at the region, saying his overall plan to cut taxes and encourage partnerships between the public and private sectors would stimulate the economy. He did say that he would encourage more high-technology businesses to settle here and suggested that the region would benefit from a high-speed rail link to downstate, but he did not speak of the ideas in detail.</p>
        <p>Some in the audience expressed impatience, asking for specifics on what he would do as senator.</p>
        <p>Patrick Mills, who would not give his party affiliation but said he had not decided whom to vote for in November, told Mr. Lazio that he had spent too much time telling the group what ''disqualifies your opponent rather than what qualifies you.'' Another man, John Ford, pointed at the dock outside and asked Mr. Lazio what he would do to develop that area. Mr. Lazio replied that it would depend on the vision of local officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has spent the past few days emphasizing his tax-cut plan in speeches, but he no longer assigns a figure to it. When he unveiled it in a speech last month, he said it would amount to $776 billion over the next decade, but Democrats and news reports suggested the figure was closer to $1 trillion, putting it much more in line with the one proposed by Gov. George W. Bush. Mr. Lazio's aides have since conceded that some of the figures he used were outdated, though he has stood by the plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's latest swing through the state, which began Wednesday and concludes Saturday, is a prelude to a high-energy drive to secure the upstate vote, his strategists say.</p>
        <p>Although it is a traditionally Republican area, polls -- both independent and Mr. Lazio's -- suggest that Mrs. Clinton poses a strong challenge after heavily campaigning  with the message that the upstate economy is hurting and that she will focus on fixing it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's assistants said he would spend considerable time upstate next month, focusing on potential supporters of Vice President Al Gore who tell pollsters they are undecided on a choice for Senate. ''Anyone who says they support Gore but are undecided in this race does not want to vote for Hillary Clinton,'' a top Lazio official said. ''They are looking for a reason not to vote for Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides said he had been hurt by commercials from Mrs. Clinton and her supporters that have set back his efforts to tell voters who he is.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has complained that the advertisements have distorted his record, and on this trip he has made an effort to correct what he considers misconceptions, especially regarding Medicare. Mrs. Clinton's camp has run commercials saying that Mr. Lazio voted to cut Medicare by $270 billion; Mr. Lazio instead voted to cut the rate of growth in the program, a position Mrs. Clinton has also supported. In his speeches, Mr. Lazio has told people not to pay attention to the advertisements.</p>
        <p>Later, at a nursing home in Rochester, Julia Macikowski, 89, asked Mr. Lazio about his Medicare plan.</p>
        <p>He replied: ''I'm going to work to make Medicare stronger and to strengthen Social Security. I know how important that is to you.''</p>
