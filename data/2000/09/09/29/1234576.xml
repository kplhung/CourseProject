        <p>Andreea Raducan still can't believe that her gold medal for winning the gymnastics individual all-around competition was stripped from her for taking a cold medication that contained a substance banned by the International Olympic Committee.</p>
        <p>And even today, as the Court of Arbitration upheld the I.O.C.'s decision, the 16-year-old continued to be mystified that taking an over-the-counter drug, pseudoephedrine, that was administered by the Romanian team doctor, could result in such a drastic outcome.</p>
        <p>''I took an innocent pill because I wasn't feeling well,'' she said through a translator during a news conference. ''It didn't help me to compete but gave me some dizziness that impeded my competition.''</p>
        <p>''I am disappointed,'' she added. ''It's not for me to judge the decision, but I am convinced and my heart is at peace that I did everything right and competed fairly.''</p>
        <p>Raducan won the all-around event on Sept. 21, but a subsequent urine sample detected traces of pseudoephedrine, leading the I.O.C. to take back her gold medal. On Wednesday, the International Court of Arbitration for Sport, which settles international sporting disputes, heard her appeal during a four-and-a-half-hour hearing.</p>
        <p>The three-member panel acknowledged that pseudoephedrine did not enhance Raducan's performance, but ruled that the positive drug offense violated the Olympic anti-doping code.</p>
        <p>''A strict liability test must thus be applied,'' the court said in a brief opinion, ''the consequence being automatic disqualification as a matter of law and in fairness to all other athletes.''</p>
        <p>The court held that the ''presence of a prohibited substance in a competitor's bodily fluid'' is the threshold issue, not whether Raducan intended to ''ingest the prohibited substance.'' As a result, it said, the anti-doping code  ''must be enforced without compromise.''</p>
        <p>Those who defended Raducan at the hearing sought an exception to the zero-tolerance policy, precisely because there was no sinister intent and because of her confidence that her doctor would not give her a banned substance. But to the court, ignorance of the code was not a defense.</p>
        <p>Nadia Comaneci, who won three gold medals competing for Romania in the 1976 Summer Olympics, including one in the individual all-around event, said, ''It's difficult for me to explain to her that she is innocent, but she's having the medal taken from her.''</p>
        <p>Ion Tiriac, the president of the Romanian Olympic Committee, criticized the Court of Arbitration for being less interested in the law than it should have been.</p>
        <p>''I always believed it was a court of law and nothing about sports, and it would look at every case for its merits where somebody has to be proved guilty beyond any other doubt, particularly with this case,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We're talking about aspirin, not drugs.'' Regarding the I.O.C., he said, ''They don't have the courage to say in this case they might have been mistaken.''</p>
        <p>Tiriac said he would resign his position rather than enforce against Raducan his blanket policy of banning for life all Romanian athletes from competing in the Olympics if they test positive for drugs. ''I could not look her in the eyes and for an aspirin ban her for life,'' Tiriac said.</p>
        <p>Tiriac defended the doctor who gave Raducan the medication yet blamed him for his apparent ignorance about the banned substance. The doctor, Ioachin Oana, was expelled for the remainder of the Summer Games and banned from the 2002 Winter and 2004 Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p>''He's a good man, but he will be the devil from now on,'' Tiriac said. ''He does his best, but he uses what's on hand for the sick. He's experienced but not really Olympic experienced.''</p>
        <p>Tiriac added, ''He didn't study every cold remedy, but may have known it was on the banned list.''</p>
        <p>The beneficiaries of the revocation of Raducan's gold medal were her Romanian teammates: Simona Amanar moved up from the silver, and Maria Olaru swapped bronze for silver. The fourth-place finisher, Liu Xuan of China, gets the bronze.</p>
        <p>''For me, the medal doesn't mean anything,'' Amanar said. ''I'm going to accept it because it belongs to Romania. But I didn't win it. The Olympic champion that day was Andreea, not me.''</p>
        <p>Although Raducan lost the all-around gold, she was allowed to keep the gold she won as part of the team competition and the silver medal she won in the vault.</p>
        <p>''My whole dream in my life was to come to the Olympics and maybe win a medal,'' Raducan said. ''I did that. But life goes on and I just have to get over this as soon as I can. We did a good job here. I lost a medal, maybe, but in my soul, I know it was my place.''</p>
