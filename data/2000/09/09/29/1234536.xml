        <p>Confirming rumors that first emerged online, the producers of ''Seussical'' said yesterday that the director and choreographer Rob Marshall will be brought in to help doctor the highly anticipated musical.</p>
        <p>In a terse two-sentence statement the producers said: ''Rob Marshall will be joining the 'Seussical' rehearsals to lend an additional pair of eyes to the show. We're glad to have him with us.'' Frank Galati will remain the director.</p>
        <p>The announcement comes after several weeks of heavy tinkering with the show, inspired by Dr. Seuss, which retreated to New York on Sunday after a bumpy monthlong tryout in Boston. In recent weeks the show's costume designer has been replaced, blocking and lyrics have been dropped and added, and the first Broadway preview was pushed back three days, to Oct. 18. The producers have sought a positive spin, saying no musical is born wart-free and pointing to the show's early sales (some $4.5 million).</p>
        <p>News of Mr. Marshall's involvement first leaked through a theater Web site, Broadway.com. Mr. Marshall, whose credits include the recent revivals of ''Cabaret,'' ''She Loves Me'' and ''Damn Yankees,'' joins his sister on the creative team of ''Seussical''; Kathleen Marshall is the show's choreographer.</p>
        <p>Young British Anguish</p>
        <p>Between plays like Jez Butterworth's ''Mojo'' and Mark Ravenhill's ''Shopping and . . .,'' New York stages in recent years have been awash in the angst of young British playwrights. Now comes news of two more imports from two of Britain's most touted -- and twisted -- young talents.</p>
        <p>Second things first. Beginning in late January audiences will see the return of Martin McDonagh, who has already had three major productions in New York, most famously ''The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' the tale of a wretched old woman and her impulsively homicidal daughter. (A stove poker was involved.)</p>
        <p>That play, which won four Tony awards on Broadway, was the first of three that Mr. McDonagh, a 30-year-old Londoner, set in the soggy -- and fictional -- Irish town of Leenane. In 1999 he returned to New York with ''The Lonesome West,'' the trilogy's third segment, which followed the lives of two brothers at war in a dank room. It fared less well with critics but featured one of the greatest demolitions of a stove in stage history. (A gun was involved.)</p>
        <p>Now the Roundabout Theater Company has announced it will produce the second installment of the Leenane Trilogy: ''A Skull in Connemara,'' which, like its predecessors, promises lots of dark humor and a felony or two. (No weapons have been announced.) The play had its United States debut at A Contemporary Theater in Seattle in July. The New York production, at the Gramercy Theater, will include much of Seattle's creative team, including the director Gordon Edelstein.</p>
        <p>Several months before Mr. McDonagh's return, another British playwright will make a posthumous debut under more somber circumstances. She is Sarah Kane, the onetime enfant terrible of the British theater whose short career ended last year when she committed suicide in a London hospital. She was 28.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kane scandalized and electrified audiences in London in 1995 with her first play, ''Blasted,'' the story of a tabloid journalist who lures a mentally retarded girl into his home. Ms. Kane followed that work with several other provocative scripts, including ''4:48 Psychosis,'' her final play. Its subject? Despair.</p>
        <p>A small Greenwich Village theater, the Axis Company, will stage the American premiere of one of Ms. Kane's most highly praised plays, ''Crave'' (1997), the story of four voices warring for an individual's soul.</p>
        <p>One of those voices may sound familiar to fans of 1980's-era pop: Deborah Harry, the lead singer of Blondie, will play one of Ms. Kane's troubled spirits. Performances are scheduled to begin on Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>Aged, That Aquarius</p>
        <p>Three months after taking over as artistic director of Encores!, the annual concert series at City Center, Jack Viertel is ready to announce his productions for next spring. He's not sure of the order or the directors, but considering the nature of one of his choices, that's cool, man.</p>
        <p>It is ''Hair,'' the seminal 1968 antiwar musical, which ran 1,750 performances on Broadway and set the standard for nudity long before ''The Full Monty.'' (No word if Encores! will recreate the original, um, mise-en-scene.)</p>
        <p>Also on tap this season are two earlier gems, including ''A Connecticut Yankee,'' the 1927 Rodgers and Hart tale (revised in 1943) about a bumbling bachelor who suddenly finds himself at play in King Arthur's Court (or so he believes).</p>
        <p>And finally there's ''Bloomer Girl,'' with music by Harold Arlen and lyrics by E. Y. Harburg, from 1944. The musical is the story of an irrepressible suffragette, played by Celeste Holm in the original. No word yet on who might fill the bloomers this time around, but Ms. Holm herself is busy, and at City Center, no less. She is to join Joanne Woodward, Edward Herrmann and Alec Baldwin in a reading of ''Arsenic and Old Lace,'' the inaugural production of the new Voices! series, on Nov. 11.</p>
        <p>'Slightly Ragged Writer'</p>
        <p>Sunday's is the final performance of ''Middle Finger,'' a little-noticed production by a prolific young writer with some big credentials.</p>
        <p>He is Han Ong, who won a MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' grant worth $200,000 in 1997 at the ripe old age of 29. Mr. Ong, the author of three dozen plays, says that while the award was a ''huge shock,'' it has done little to enhance his name recognition. ''I think I received a sum total of zero offers,'' he said, laughing.</p>
        <p>His current effort, at the Blue Heron Arts Center, at 123 East 24th Street in Manhattan, is produced by Ma-Yi, a company devoted to work about and by Filipino-Americans, and tells the story of two young men suffering through puberty.</p>
        <p>And while not much attention has been paid, Mr. Ong isn't discouraged; his next play will be produced by Ma-Yi in the spring, around the time that his first novel is published. ''I'm a prolific but slightly ragged writer,'' he said. ''I can't imagine spending a year on anything.''</p>
        <p>ON STAGE AND OFF</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 17, 2005, Sunday  An article on April 3 about Martin McDonagh referred incorrectly to Leenane, where his play ''The Beauty Queen of Leenane'' is set. It is a village in western Ireland; it is not fictional. (The error also appeared in the On Stage and Off column in the Weekend section on Sept. 29, 2000.)</p>
