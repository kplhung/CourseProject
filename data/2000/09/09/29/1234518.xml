        <p>The exhibitions of Bridget Riley's work at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea and at PaceWildenstein on East 57th Street may be a case of perfect timing. At a point when contemporary art can seem bogged down with narrative, language and representation, when photographic images and video maintain an around-the-clock bombardment, and when realism is one of the few connecting links between mediums and styles, Ms. Riley's bracingly pure abstractions, sustained for four decades, seem literally to clear the air.

        <p>The exhibitions of Bridget Riley's work at the Dia Center for the Arts in Chelsea and at PaceWildenstein on East 57th Street may be a case of perfect timing. At a point when contemporary art can seem bogged down with narrative, language and representation, when photographic images and video maintain an around-the-clock bombardment, and when realism is one of the few connecting links between mediums and styles, Ms. Riley's bracingly pure abstractions, sustained for four decades, seem literally to clear the air. They are a sight for sore eyes, even if they sometimes cause them, too.</p>
        <p>In ways alternately supremely refined and mechanically rudimentary, these works repeatedly demonstrate that the art experience is at base one of pure, unadulterated looking. You place your eyes in front of an artwork and something happens that happens no place else in the world.</p>
        <p>At 69 Ms. Riley might be described as the grand dame of British art, the queen to Lucien Freud's king, but she has never received her due in New York. The small 25-year survey of paintings at Dia, and the show of studies from the 1960's and paintings from the 1980's and 90's at PaceWildenstein, are the first New York exhibitions of Ms. Riley's art since 1990; together they constitute the first local attempt to account for her achievement. The closest any of her several retrospectives has come to New York City was one at the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, N.Y., in 1979.</p>
        <p>Mustering a total of 41 works, the two shows should finally start bringing New York up to speed with Ms. Riley's stringent yet accessible brand of abstraction. Nearly half of the 19 paintings at Dia are the black-and-white canvases whose eye-popping patterns instantly established her reputation in the early 60's and, to her detriment, defined her as a pillar of Op Art.</p>
        <p>''Perceptual abstraction'' was the name the Museum of Modern Art gave Op when it mounted its ''Responsive Eye'' exhibition in 1965 and put the buzzy, marcelled lines of Ms. Riley's black-and-white ''Current'' on its catalog's cover. But whatever it was called, Op was viewed more as a fad than an art movement in New York, where Color Field and Minimalism were the formalist tendencies of choice. People tend to forget that ''The Responsive Eye'' included a host of New York painters never tainted with the Op label, from Ad Reinhardt and Josef Albers to Kenneth Noland, Ellsworth Kelly, Larry Poons and Frank Stella.</p>
        <p>The fallback assessment of Ms. Riley's work, especially in New York, has often been that the early black-and-white paintings are her main achievement, far better than the paintings using color that began to emerge in the late 60's. But the Dia and Pace shows outline the achievement of an impressively consistent, continually striving artist who has pursued an evolving idea of optical ity through stripes, waves, elongated toothsome wedges and diagonal patterns of all kinds, investigating different sites along the color spectrum in the process and even, at Dia, working directly on the wall. Her determination to maintain forward motion, to avoid repetition without losing her thread, has an aura of extreme, almost monastic dedication similar to that of Jasper Johns.</p>
        <p>At Dia especially it's great to be able to see so many of the paintings in person; they shed their pseudo-scientific aura and turn out to be delicately handmade from beginning to end. For example, when you think that a plume of whitish or grayish haze hovering above a work's geometric shapes has been delivered via spray can, look again; the effect is achieved by infinitesimal shifts in the tones of the shapes themselves.</p>
        <p>The exhibitions indicate that Ms. Riley has produced weak and strong work throughout her career. The black-and-white Op paintings can be lovely and subtle. ''Static 2'' from 1966 is simply a pegboardlike grid of small black dots on white. But each dot is, in fact, a carefully angled ellipse; the field of them generates a thin, off-register tufted pillow of pictorial space.</p>
        <p>Flanking a window in the small chapel-like final gallery of the Dia show, this painting faces a shimmering charcoal painting from 1967 titled ''Deny II,'' in which the ellipses are larger, like Mr. Poons's paintings from the same time and shrouded in a hazy chevron, like Mr. Noland's. Together, in this room, the two works constitute one of the best viewing experiences presently available in the city.</p>
        <p>But other examples of Ms. Riley's early paintings can be so aggressive that they don't simply stimulate vision in the traditional sense, they commandeer it, take it on a careering joy ride and leave it in a frazzled heap. There is, for example, the slithery contraction of the black-and-white checkerboard perpetuated by an Op classic like ''Movement in Squares'' of 1961 or the colorful fireworks that can result from looking too hard at ''Crest,'' whose thin black-and-white hairpin curves are a cousin of ''Current.''</p>
        <p>In the early 1980's, the appropriationist painter Philip Taaffe used ''Crest'' as the basis for a nearly identical work called ''Brest.'' Looking at the original, one realizes that he did not so much ''finish'' the work, as he maintained, as soften it, giving it a lustrous patina of age that Ms. Riley's works never have. These exhibitions also indicate that her use of color grew naturally, if warily, out of the black-and-white works. Her approach is traced in the 14 gouache studies at Pace, all from the mid- to late 60's, through strikingly beautiful, incipiently colorful shades of gray.</p>
        <p>For me the color works similarly divide between what I might call cheap tricks and genuine ones. Spend time with the candy-cane rivulets of ''Entice 2'' (1974), which also might be compared to the twists of a Baroque column, and its bulging surface will suddenly tilt inward into a series of concave troughs, which can literally be a headache. But in the 1973 ''Paean,'' vertical tripartite stripes of red, green and blue on white are so succinct in hue and juxtaposition that the lines start to break up into little pulsating squares, like those in Mondrian's ''Broadway Boogie Woogie.'' And there are the radiant color reciprocities and battenlike spatial illusions of Ms. Riley's pungently pastel stripe paintings of the early 80's: ''Samarra'' at Dia and ''Isfahan,'' ''Blue Quiver'' and ''Poppy'' at Pace.</p>
        <p>Also at Pace are the slightly less impressive paintings from the early 90's: ''Dark Light,'' ''In Attendance'' and ''By Way of Yellow.'' Dominated by stacks of short diagonals in a wide-ranging palette, and clearly inspired by Seurat, these works are distinguished by a faceted shifting sense of hue and depth that is simultaneously blurry and crystal clear. One looks through them as one might look through trees dappled with light.</p>
        <p>For the New York state of mind in the 60's Ms. Riley's main offense must have been her persistent involvement with optical illusion at a time when ''the flatness of the picture plane'' was the mantra on either side of the Color Field-Minimalist aisle. Clement Greenberg saw flatness as painting's essence; Donald Judd saw it as an escape route into three dimensions.</p>
        <p>In contrast Ms. Riley's project suggests that spatial illusion itself is both painting's essence, and its road forward, that its possibilities are not exhausted. Furthermore her work implies that this optical transformation is simply the clearest example of the magic we should expect in some guise from all art.</p>
        <p>Finally, as long as one is criticizing Ms. Riley's paintings for their aggressiveness, it should be noted that there are plenty of assaultive artworks outside painting, in video and installation. It makes a certain sense that Ms. Riley admires the work of Bruce Nauman. (She has written an essay on him.) Think of some of her tougher canvases as the painting equivalent of Mr. Nauman's brawling video installation ''Clown Torture,'' and keep in mind her desire, as she once put it, for ''a painting to be an extremely naked kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>''Bridget Riley: Reconnaissance'' is at the Dia Center for the Arts, 548 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-5566, through June 17. ''Bridget Riley: Paintings 1982-2000 and Early Works on Paper'' is at PaceWildenstein, 32 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 421-3292, through Oct. 21.</p>
