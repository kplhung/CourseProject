        <p>Watching ''Big Brother'' has been as exciting as watching vegetables grow. More precisely, it has been as exciting as watching people put together a jigsaw puzzle, one of the many inane tasks assigned to the 10 contestants who agreed to live in a house for three months with cameras on them 24 hours a day. You may be wondering why producers would even imagine that seeing people set up dominoes or ride a stationary bike would create dynamic television, but it turns out that such stupid human tricks are not to blame for the show's failure.</p>
        <p>Similar tasks have been used in the 10 other versions of ''Big Brother'' around the world, and they have still become hits as the franchise has spread from the Netherlands through Germany to Spain. What's wrong with us? Or is the United States the only ''Big Brother'' to get things right, philosophically, even if that philosophy has meant stultifying television?</p>

        <p>Watching ''Big Brother'' has been as exciting as watching vegetables grow. More precisely, it has been as exciting as watching people put together a jigsaw puzzle, one of the many inane tasks assigned to the 10 contestants who agreed to live in a house for three months with cameras on them 24 hours a day. You may be wondering why producers would even imagine that seeing people set up dominoes or ride a stationary bike would create dynamic television, but it turns out that such stupid human tricks are not to blame for the show's failure.</p>
        <p>Similar tasks have been used in the 10 other versions of ''Big Brother'' around the world, and they have still become hits as the franchise has spread from the Netherlands through Germany to Spain. What's wrong with us? Or is the United States the only ''Big Brother'' to get things right, philosophically, even if that philosophy has meant stultifying television?</p>
        <p>The major difference between our ''Big Brother'' and the others is bland niceness. Other countries' contestants sniped at one another, had sex, created drama. The Americans acted as if they were in some celibate, selfless commune, and just happened to be wearing body mikes. They are walking, talking symbols of the sensitive, Oprah-ization of American culture.</p>
        <p>Tonight's live, hourlong finale (at 8 on CBS) will reveal which of the three remaining contestants has won $500,000. (The others were tossed out, one by one, by viewers who phoned in votes at 99 cents a call.) But the truer cultural revelation has been shaping up for weeks. The CBS ''Big Brother'' veered away from sensational chair-tossing television and displayed how  Americans want to think of ourselves -- good-natured and noncompetitive -- which is not necessarily the same as who we are.</p>
        <p>''Big Brother'' should have been the ultimate in living life for the camera, with a half-hour of filmed excerpts five nights a week, an hourlong live show weekly and 24-hour Web casts presenting what the television versions did not. Every other week, contestants voted on which two (or more) of them would be nominated for expulsion; that meant they had to play to each other. But they also had to play to the television audience. The potential for mind games, poses and strategies makes ''Survivor'' look like a day at the circus.</p>
        <p>But ''Big Brother'' is the anti-''Survivor,'' and its weaker ratings are just the start. It is a commercial disappointment. CBS has tried to spin this by noting how much ''Big Brother'' ratings have improved over last summer's programs, but last summer CBS presented reruns, not this hugely hyped event.</p>
        <p>The casting was timid; people in the European houses were on the average younger and more daring. Then there was the dreadful editing, which often dropped viewers into confusing conversations yet could spend excruciating minutes watching someone nail up letters spelling ''Happy Anniversary,'' then watch someone else correct his spelling.</p>
        <p>These failures hurt, but the real problem was the group's sense of community. Viewers of ''Survivor'' loved its intrigue, as Richard Hatch plotted his success. The cast members of ''Big Brother'' think strategy is a dirty word; they say that ''the experience,'' as they so sensitively call it, is more important than money.</p>
        <p>Blandness Paid Off</p>
        <p>Voters in the audiences seem to have bought this psychobabble. The most confrontational contestants were the first to go, starting with Will. The only black man in the group, he determinedly stirred up intense conversations about race. The manipulative and self-absorbed Jordan, a former stripper, went next. The most successful contestants used blandness as protective cover (whether calculatedly or because they couldn't help it, we may never know).</p>
        <p>The producers will reveal little about the voters, except to say they form a small percentage of total viewers. Whether the voters are typical or not, they have placed two of the most agreeable personalities among the three finalists, all of them men in their 20's.</p>
        <p>Josh, originally cast as the womanizer, has turned out to be meek. It was news on the Web this week when two members of the Italian ''Big Brother'' had sex. In England, after a flirty woman called Mel was voted out, that Web site wrote, ''Sex kitten's memory lives on.'' Here the attitude seems to be, ''No sex, please, we're CBS.''</p>
        <p>Once, Josh almost kissed Brittany, the sometimes pink-haired, sometimes green-haired self-proclaimed virgin. ''The reason I don't want to kiss you is because I like you,'' he said, saving himself for a meeting with her outside the house. This sincere self-restraint can't be what the producers hoped for.</p>
        <p>Another finalist is Curtis, a law school graduate whose every comment is followed by a big infectious laugh that saves him from ever seeming harsh. The producers tried to stir up trouble. In the so-called Red Room, where contestants talk directly to the camera and name their candidates for expulsion (out of earshot of their housemates), the disembodied voice of Big Brother asked, ''Are you nominating Josh because he's competition for you?'' Curtis said, ''I hope not.''</p>
        <p>And when the earnest Cassandra (voted out three weeks ago) was asked a similar question about whether she was strategizing, she stomped out of the Red Room and said, ''I'm so insulted.'' A common refrain in the group was, ''I'd nominate myself if I could.''</p>
        <p>A Rebellion That Fizzled</p>
        <p>The only finalist who has been direct about wanting to win the contest is Eddie, a straightforward New Yorker who lost a leg to cancer when he was a boy. ''As much as they say it may be about the 'experience,' it's about money,'' he told the Red Room camera. But with the slightest nudge he agreed when his self-abnegating housemates suggested a mass walkout.</p>
        <p>That loony attempt at rebellion isn't up there with the Boston Tea Party, but it was the series' high point. For a day or so it was satisfying to watch as the producers nearly lost control of their show. The revolt was started by George, a roofer in his 40's, who seemed like a sane family man at first. Soon, he was letting Brittany dye his hair green, and Jamie, a would-be actress who won the Miss Washington USA pageant, try out her makeup on him. George inexplicably wore a toga on the night he was voted out; like so many of his attempts at humor, the get-up was baffling.</p>
        <p>Last month, George misread the fine print in the contestants' contract with ''Big Brother,'' and decided that if the remaining six members walked out together they would share the prize money. (The runner-up gets $100,000 and the third-place finisher $50,000.) He was convinced that this was the secret intent of the producers all along, the hidden message those European ''Big Brother'' houses had failed to get: teamwork and brotherhood. He even convinced Eddie to go along. The rebellion collapsed when the producers explained that no one would get anything if they all walked out.</p>
        <p>Let's not forget that they all walked in because they were willing to trade their privacy for the possibility of fame and $500,000. Still, it's easy to see why this misguided idea of unity appealed to them. They had been isolated from contact with the outside world for two months; they had become increasingly suspicious of the producers; they were intensely aware of the cameras. Brittany, interviewed on the show after she had left the house, explained how conscious everyone had been of the producers' attention. ''Once you say something they think is important, you'd hear 'Whrrr,' '' as the hidden camera zoomed in.</p>
        <p>Unanswered Questions</p>
        <p>How much of the contestants all-for-one attitude was genuine? How much was smart posturing for each other and the public? How much was the delusional result of having been in captivity?</p>
        <p>They're not letting on. The recently expelled contestants have continued to gush about their terrific ''experience.'' Jordan has griped that the editing made her look bad, but she was sent home so early it's impossible to separate her bitterness from sour grapes.</p>
        <p>Despite the disappointment of this ''Big Brother,'' CBS may try another, this time with a more volatile cast. Americans can create reality television in a livelier way. MTV's ''Real World'' loads a house with  young people raging with hormones and curiosity, and actually sends them out of the house. This season's cast lived in New Orleans and produced a public-access television show.</p>
        <p>The success of confrontational reality shows exposes the gap between our noblest self-image and our mischievous delight in others' conflicts. What the public says it wants and what it watches are two different things. If viewers had been voting on ''Survivor,'' Richard, who was at the bottom of popularity polls, might have been voted off first. That would have been the ''correct'' choice, proving how good-natured we are and how we admire straightforwardness.</p>
        <p>The ''Big Brother'' contestants have turned this attitude to their advantage, but their determination to be likable may have been short-sighted. Jamie, who was tossed out only three days ago, brooded recently when a plane flew over the yard trailing the message that she was ''two-faced.'' Her housemates assured her they didn't believe it. (Despite many suspicions, the producers say that neither they nor CBS had anything to do with the many banners flown over the house. An early one read: ''Big Brother is worse than you think. Get out now.'')</p>
        <p>Money and Celebrity</p>
        <p>But in England's ''Big Brother,'' Craig, a builder who went on to win, dramatically confronted Nick, a stockbroker, across the kitchen table. ''How can you be so two-faced?'' Craig asked, challenging Nick after he had been caught lying about passing notes and trying to orchestrate the nominations (a violation of the ''Big Brother'' rules). Nasty Nick, as he was called by the English tabloids, had done worse than that. He had concocted a sob story that his wife had been tragically killed in a car crash. The producers kicked him out for cheating, but he went on to  sell his story to a tabloid for as much money as the ''Big Brother'' grand prize, and become the most famous character on the series.</p>
        <p>''Big Brother,'' after all, is a game show about money and celebrity. The Americans' togetherness quietly undermined the show's crass, humans-on-display tone, but it didn't change the world. When they get out, they have to face a harsh reality; in their isolation, they seem to have thought that a huge audience has been paying attention.</p>
