        <p>Leave it to Barbra Streisand to turn her own life into a musical fairy tale, one with a resoundingly happy ending. That is the essence of the farewell show Ms. Streisand brought to Madison Square Garden for two sold-out performances on Wednesday evening and last night.</p>
        <p>The personal story she tells in songs and anecdotes is a variation on  any number of myths in which a lonely, gifted child who never knew her father finds and marries a handsome prince. She also becomes  queen of the Hollywood dream factory with her spellbinding voice.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streisand's show even includes a child version of herself: the gifted young singer Lauren Frost is used to fine dramatic effect playing the singer as an adolescent girl recording ''You'll Never Know.'' Ms. Streisand eventually chimes in, and the two join voices on ''Something's Coming.''</p>
        <p>Later, in the most effective of several video sequences, Ms. Frost and Ms. Streisand rejoin voices with video images (two live and one from the  movie ''Yentl'') singing ''Papa Can You Hear Me?'' The song is the touching climax to Ms. Streisand's anecdote about being sent a love letter her father wrote to a woman (not her mother) when he was 19.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the show, which was taped for Home Box Office, is a fairly  straightforward career retrospective that carries the singer from that early recording session to nightclubs to Broadway, and finally to Hollywood and a late-blooming romance and marriage to the actor James Brolin. The closer it gets to the present, the more shamelessly sentimental the show becomes. The love songs that accompany Ms. Streisand's wedding and happily-ever-after pictures with Mr. Brolin are pure greeting-card mush. The wonder is that Ms. Streisand's voice can make such sing-songy romantic doggerel sound, if not deep, at least deeply heartfelt. No pop singer invests the word love with such a swooning sense of expectation, voluptuously half-rolling the l, tremulously intoning the o, purring the v, lending the silent e an aura of breathless anticipation.</p>
        <p>The show offers no less than two grand finales. The first finds Ms. Streisand ascending a stairway to the stars after segueing a quiveringly tender version of the kitsch  inspirational anthem ''I Believe'' with ''Somewhere'' (from ''West Side Story''), dressed up with grand, thumping flourishes. During the second finale, a gorgeously sung sequence of ballads that includes a pensive ''Before the Parade Passes By'' and ends with a triumphal ''People,'' Ms. Streisand briefly discusses her retirement from live performance but promises to keep making records and films.</p>
        <p>What's most surprising about Ms. Streisand's show is the degree to which her personal fulfillment has lightened up her singing. She has always been better in a relaxed,  tender mode than in her steely stentorian one. In her recordings, especially her more recent ones, Ms. Streisand's perfectionist drive has tended to eradicate spontaneity in the quest for an inhuman technical perfection.</p>
        <p>Again and again, the singing on Wednesday conveyed a relaxed joy, a playful tenderness that rarely makes it to Ms. Streisand's recordings nowadays. If some of her top  notes have disappeared, her middle register has gained in fullness, and the breathless, spinning vibrato she wields like an emotional slingshot is more expressive than ever.</p>
        <p>Among the show's many magical moments, some of the most memorable were a wistful ''The Way We Were,'' a tender ''Something Wonderful,'' ''Alfie,'' ''Send in the  Clowns,'' ''Don't Like Goodbyes,'' and a big, pumping Brazilian-flavored ''Come Rain or Come Shine.'' Only two numbers seriously grated: the frantic disco hit ''The Main Event'' (Cher does this stuff much better) and a mismatched beyond-the-grave video duet with Frank Sinatra on ''I've Got a Crush on You.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately the concerts reconfirmed Ms. Streisand's status as the last (and possibly the greatest) true believer in the old romantic myths that are vanishing from pop. She's  living proof that schoolgirl dreams really do come true, and happy endings aren't just found in fairy tales. But if these are really her last concerts, her happy ending is our loss.</p>
