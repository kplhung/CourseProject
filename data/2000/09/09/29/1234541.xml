        <p>The young, brooding guard from Italy was shaken, his words tumbling over each other after the wrenching, last-second loss to Australia.</p>
        <p>''We started well on defense,'' began 26-year-old Andrea Meneghin, fingering his black beard, ''but then Mr. Gaze does something out of the ordinary. I still can't come to terms with what he did.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Gaze is almost gray at age 35. He shuffles around the floor almost hunched over, the way arthritic former athletes walk. Gaunt and stoop-shouldered, he looks less the part of an Olympic shooting guard and more that of a volunteer bus driver from Perth. Or of a pastry chef from Adelaide.</p>
        <p>When the Australian point guard, Shane Heal, referred to him as ''the Michael Jordan of Australia'' today, Gaze shook his head.</p>
        <p>''It is grossly inaccurate, mainly because I have zero athleticism,'' he said. ''And I think that the only small, faint resemblance would be the profile in Australia -- you know. But no similarities. Zero.''</p>
        <p>Yet insert Gaze into the crucible of a tight game, and Australia's ancient gym rat will still pull up from anywhere on the court. He scored 13 of Australia's last 15 points today in a 65-62 thriller over Italy, dropping in 3-point bombs and crucial free throws before a crowd of nearly 15,000 at the Super Dome who stood and applauded for several minutes after the team left the court.</p>
        <p>Scoring 27 points, Gaze willed Australia within one victory of its first medal in men's basketball, setting up a semifinal showdown with France on Friday night. The winner almost certainly gets the United States in Sunday afternoon's gold medal game.</p>
        <p>Several hours after Gaze's memorable performance, Team USA struggled early against Russia before advancing with an emotionally charged 85-70 victory. The 15-point margin was the third-lowest a team of National Basketball Association players had won by in an Olympic game.</p>
        <p>Vince Carter nearly got into an altercation with the Russian point guard Yevgeny Pachoutine, who appeared to nudge Carter with an elbow to the groin as he took flight toward the basket near the end of the half.</p>
        <p>The United States will meet Lithuania Friday night in a semifinal game. Lithuania was an upset victor over Yugoslavia in the other quarterfinal tonight. France knocked off Canada, advancing to the semifinals for the first time since 1956 in Melbourne. The French have not played for a gold medal since 1948.</p>
        <p>But Gaze and Australia stand in the way of the French. If the Australian captain and five-time Olympian could muster another night of magic, NBC probably would not mind showing him off on Sunday.</p>
        <p>A victory over France would propel the upstart Australians and their flag-bearer against Carter and the invincible Americans for everything in the Olympic kitty.</p>
        <p>How the Boomers, the Australians' team nickname, became compelling over the last week is almost as big a mystery as why no team can stop the indefatigable Gaze.</p>
        <p>Losing their first two preliminary games, the Boomers have won five straight games. With Gaze and Heal supplying the ammunition from outside and Luc Longley and Mark Bradtke pounding away inside, the Australians have shared the ball and become the second-most entertaining team in the tournament after Carter, Kevin Garnett and the United States.</p>
        <p>''You go ask the other guys, particularly the Americans, they see the way we play as a throwback to the 60's,'' Gaze said. ''You know, we've got Luc Longley cutting from the 3-point line to the basket. We're moving players around.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, they lost a 10-point lead and trailed by 53-50 when Gaze fired in a 3-pointer with 5 minutes 42 seconds remaining. He added another a minute later and then a short jumper in the key. He hit two clutch free throws with 13 seconds remaining to preserve the margin of victory.</p>
        <p>When the drama ended, the Super Dome crowd rose and applauded the old man and his resilient teammates. Gaze also shot down Russia by knocking down a late 3-pointer last week.</p>
        <p>''This happened many times in this tournament,'' said the Italian coach, Bogdan Tanjevic, through a translator. ''He saved the match against Russia. This is an honor to him, to be 35 years old and be the best player on the pitch. I congratulate him.''</p>
        <p>Most Americans remember Gaze as the shaggy-haired perimeter threat from Seton Hall, who gunned the Pirates into the national championship game against Michigan in 1989. A string of tryouts, two 10-day contracts and short stints in the N.B.A. followed, most recently as a seldom-used reserve with the world-champion San Antonio Spurs in 1999. He also played in Greece and Italy.</p>
        <p>He became the greatest player in Australian history, winning 13 scoring titles and seven most valuable player awards for his hometown Melbourne Tigers of the National Basketball League. Gaze once scored 60 points in a game and averaged 44 points for a season.</p>
