        <p>Ken Johnson reviews art by Stephanie Brooke at Ten in One Gallery (S)</p>

        <p>Ten in One Gallery</p>

        <p>Through Oct. 14</p>
        <p>Conceptually funny and formally clever, the works of Stephanie Brooks also give pause for deeper philosophical reflections. This young Chicago artist's method is to conflate ordinarily unrelated verbal or visual systems and to embody these odd couplings in sleek signs or objects. A pair of illuminated star charts, for example, have constellations labeled by the names of fancy chocolates: ''Black Forest truffle,'' ''apricot cream,'' and so on, bringing together, one might say, celestial and terrestrial versions of the sublime. In a series of blue plastic plaques, white-lettered texts predict emotional developments in the cadences of a weather report: ''Mostly moody in the morning with scattered dramas and a few tears; increasing loneliness in the afternoon.''</p>

        <p>Conceptually funny and formally clever, the works of Stephanie Brooks also give pause for deeper philosophical reflections. This young Chicago artist's method is to conflate ordinarily unrelated verbal or visual systems and to embody these odd couplings in sleek signs or objects.

        <p>Ms. Brooks's works can make you think about the degree to which we may be trapped by familiar categories. We may put a set of smooth, slant-sided wooden objects on the floor into the Minimalist sculpture category until the title -- ''Projects/Ideas/Notes/Budget/ Addresses'' -- magically transforms them into giant file folder tabs. And coming to a set of 12 photographs of ordinary-looking people, titled ''Academics and Seafood Haters,'' one studies the faces to figure out which is which, even as one realizes the absurdity, and potential danger, of such categorization.</p>
        <p>Some philosophers might argue that we can never get free of categories; some might point to Ms. Brooks's work as evidence that we can escape at least momentarily through art and laughter.</p>
