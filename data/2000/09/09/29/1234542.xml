        <p>Ten days ago, Venus and Serena Williams arrived as two players in the Olympic medal mix, but they left today after overwhelming the scene like a dye drop in a pool.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the Williams sisters spread their talents until they became the dominant vision on the medal stand. Just 24 hours after Venus Williams won a gold medal in singles, she joined her sister Serena, to take the gold for America in doubles.</p>
        <p>''Our competition is over,'' Venus Williams said. ''We can't do anything more.''</p>
        <p>Before it was over, Venus and Serena Williams created the buzz of the tournament. Without them, the draw would have come up short in style, flair and name value. Unlike Martina Hingis and others, the Williams sisters did not consider playing for their country too taxing on their schedule. Instead, they embraced the opportunity and found joy in the Olympic atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Upon match point, Venus and Serena Williams tossed their rackets in the air, wrapped their arms around each other at the service line and hugged all the way to the net, where they greeted Miriam Oremans and Kristie Boogert, the Dutch pair they dismissed in 50 minutes.</p>
        <p>''For me, this is almost bigger than singles,'' Venus Williams said. ''It's right up there because I have this victory with Serena, my sister, my family member, my best friend.''</p>
        <p>Together, they left Oremans and Boogert all but pock-marked from the Williams mortar shots during the 6-1, 6-1 American victory.</p>
        <p>''It has been fantastic here,'' Serena Williams said. ''Just to win the gold medal, it has been a great thing for me and my family. We've worked so hard. It's great for everyone, for the whole U.S. team.''</p>
        <p>When United States Coach Billie Jean King assembled the women's team, the plan was to sweep the singles, as well as doubles. If Lindsay Davenport hadn't injured her foot, the United States might have delivered. As it was, Monica Seles won the bronze for the United States only after losing to Venus Williams in the semifinals, leaving only the silver in singles up for grabs. Russia's Elena Dementieva gladly grabbed it while she could.</p>
        <p>In the background of the Williams sisters, the Russians were quietly asserting themselves as a world power in tennis. Although Marat Safin made an early exit in the men's draw, Dementieva backed up her coming out party at the United States Open with an encore at the Olympics. And although the men's draw was more threadbare of stars than the women's side, the Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov found adrenaline from the sight of his country's flag and came up with a gold medal today in one of the best matches of the tournament.</p>
        <p>By devouring short balls with swinging forehand winners, leaning on his big serve when faced with disaster, and being patient in the heat of every intense baseline rally, Kafelnikov outlasted Tommy Haas of Germany, 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-2, 4-6, 6-3.</p>
        <p>''When I lost the fourth set today, I talked to myself,'' Kafelnikov said. ''I said, 'You have come all the way here to play the final match in the Olympics. If you lose the match, you are going to regret it the rest of your life.' And that's what kept me motivated.''</p>
        <p>There was not any shame in taking a silver back to Russia -- which Kafelnikov was reminded of in a prematch telephone conversation with his wife, Mascha, and children -- but he was inspired by the moment to win the gold.</p>
        <p>The Williams sisters felt the same way. For almost two weeks, they were not individuals but part of a team. They were not being guided by their parents, but being coached by King and her assistant, Zina Garrison. As a result, there were some tweaks made in the Williams sisters' technique. Their volleys were sharper and their doubles movement was more synchronized.</p>
        <p>''They listen very well,'' said King, who, along with Garrison, may continue some spot coaching of the sisters. ''They really want to improve.''</p>
        <p>Right now, they are close to invincible. Any better, and the Williams sisters would be untouchable. As their Olympic competition ended, Venus Williams's singles winning streak stood at 32; and the sisters had won 33 of 34 doubles matches. Putting her name down in history, Venus Williams also became the first woman to win gold medals in the singles and doubles since Helen Wills in 1924. Tennis rejoined the Olympic program in 1988, after an absence of 64 years.</p>
        <p>''Where we are right now is just good,'' Venus Williams said. ''We have done everything we could at the Olympics. When we compete, we do all that we can. Even if it's a bad decision, we give it 110 percent. Right now, we are in a really good place.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>The Williams sisters were asked to respond to JOHN McENROE's latest critique of them. In a British newspaper, McEnroe described the sisters as less than gracious in victory. ''I don't think we are here to talk about that,'' SERENA WILLIAMS said. ''I'm sure he's a great guy.'' . . . The United States women won the gold medal in singles and doubles for the third straight Olympics. In competitions where more than one gold is awarded, a country has swept the top award only three times in at least three consecutive Olympics. The most dominant team was the United States men's diving team, which swept all gold medals in 1924, 1928, 1932, 1936, 1948 and 1952.</p>
