        <p>An Indonesian court dismissed the government's corruption case against former President Suharto today after court-appointed doctors declared him medically unfit to stand trial.</p>
        <p>The ruling immediately touched off violent clashes outside the auditorium where the trial was being conducted between hundreds of supporters and opponents of Mr. Suharto, whose 32-year rule ended in 1998.</p>
        <p>As two busloads of his defenders arrived, anti-Suharto student demonstrators pelted them with rocks. The police said that one Suharto supporter was beaten to death and two were severely injured, and that a bus was set on fire.</p>
        <p>''This ruling, even though it may be legally correct, sends the wrong message to the average person: that there's still no justice in Indonesia,'' said Indira Samego, a political analyst. ''It says that politics in Indonesia are still run by the same old forces, and that's what people are going to believe until the government proves otherwise.''</p>
        <p>The ruling was a major setback for Indonesia's democratically elected government, which sought to bring the ailing 79-year-old Suharto to justice for human rights abuses. The government had also charged him with embezzling $590 million from state charities while in office.</p>
        <p>But doctors testified today that he had suffered three strokes last year that left him unable to understand or answer complex questions. One doctor said Mr. Suharto had the communications skills of ''a kindergartner'' and took up to a minute to answer basic inquiries.</p>
        <p>''We declare Suharto is unfit to stand trial,'' said Dr. Zakaria, who led a team of 24 doctors who examined Mr. Suharto over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Attorney General Marzuki Darusman expressed deep disappointment with the court's ruling, saying the justice system had failed the people. ''The thing that we aimed for, which was to truly obtain justice for the people, was not achieved,'' said Mr. Darusman, who had insisted Mr. Suharto was well enough to stand trial.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said they would appeal the decision, but they acknowledged that Mr. Suharto's declining health made it unlikely they would prevail.</p>
        <p>The corruption case was more than a reckoning with the former president and his cronies for enriching themselves at public expense. It was seen as a litmus test for restoring the rule of law and a sense of equality to Indonesia, where corruption permeated nearly every aspect of society under Mr. Suharto's government. Mr. Suharto, along with his six children, is believed to have stolen billions of dollars through a broad network of deals in which his family made money from almost every sector of the economy.</p>
        <p>The Justice Ministry today ordered the detention of Mr. Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, who is known as Tommy Suharto, after the Supreme Court overturned a lower court decision and sentenced him to an 18-month prison term for corruption.</p>
        <p>Tommy Suharto has been in the public eye since President Abdurrahman Wahid first ordered him arrested on Sept. 15 after a spate of bomb explosions in Jakarta.</p>
        <p>As word of the decision not to prosecute the former president spread, hundreds of protesters converged on his house in central Jakarta, where they were met by dozens of police officers who fired tear gas and plastic bullets into the stone-wielding crowds. The situation remained tense this evening as large numbers of officers were brought into the capital to maintain order. Many people expressed fear of increasing violence in the aftermath of the decision.</p>
        <p>''Suharto, we're coming in there to get you,'' screamed an engineering student, who identified himself as Ryacudu. ''He's not sick at all. He's pretending, just like Pinochet did.''</p>
        <p>Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, was arrested in Britain in 1999 on a warrant issued by Spain to face charges of torture and other human rights abuses, and was held under house arrest for 16 months until British doctors determined he was too sick to be extradited. On his return to Chile in March, however, General Pinochet smiled, waved his cane to acknowledge supporters and walked on his own, raising doubts about his infirmity.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Suharto had been under house arrest for more than four months during the legal and judicial gyrations of the government's case. His lawyers and doctors had repeatedly said he was too sick to attend the trial. But government physicians maintained that he was capable of understanding the case against him.</p>
        <p>After he refused to appear for two earlier court sessions, judges ordered an independent checkup, which was released today.</p>
        <p>For the new administration of President Wahid, losing the case could not have come at a worse time. Indonesia, with the world's fourth-largest population, is struggling to forge a new democracy despite a weak economy, political infighting and growing sectarian violence that has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands more.</p>
        <p>President Wahid, who was elected in October in the country's first contested election, and Attorney General Darusman are now under pressure to show that they can bring Indonesia's former regime to justice.</p>
        <p>''If the government doesn't do something to make up for the loss of the Suharto case, it will handicap the entire process of political and economic reforms, especially the sense of enforcing law and order,'' said Teten Masduki, coordinator for Indonesia Corruption Watch. ''Like it or not, despite the good that he might have done for the country, Suharto remains the focus of people's hatred.''</p>
        <p>J. E. Sahetapy, a legislator and chairman of the National Law Commission, said that to regain its credibility, the Wahid government has no choice but to vigorously prosecute Mr. Suharto's family and friends, who are accused of being active participants in the corruption schemes.</p>
