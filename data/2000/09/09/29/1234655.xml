        <p>Investigators are looking into whether a former Queens school superintendent received kickbacks of $100,000 and favorable financing terms on real estate investments in exchange for steering more than $6 million in school computer contracts to a Long Island technology company, law enforcement officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The former superintendent, Celestine Miller, 57, who was ousted last year as the leader of Community School District 29 in southeast Queens over her handling of a gun incident in one of her elementary schools, persuaded the Board of Education to award the company, Business Innovative Technology Inc. of Melville, $6.3 million to install computers at 15 schools in her district from 1996 to 1998, said the law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The president of the Long Island company is a business associate of Thomas Kontogiannis, the Queens real estate developer who sold Ms. Miller at least four houses, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The case is under investigation by the Queens district attorney's office, a Queens grand jury and the special investigator for the city school system, Edward F. Stancik, several officials said. Neither office would confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. Officials said Mr. Stancik was trying to find out whether Ms. Miller personally profited from the awarding of the contracts.</p>
        <p>The investigations come at a time when District 29, which encompasses Laurelton, Rosedale and Springfield Gardens, continues to be embroiled in turmoil over a permanent replacement for Ms. Miller. In February, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy suspended the local school board, saying it had mishandled the superintendent search, and appointed Michael A. Johnson as acting superintendent. After being reinstated, the board selected a candidate that was then rejected by Mr. Levy.</p>
        <p>Investigators are looking at whether Ms. Miller received kickbacks, including $100,000 in cash and the opportunity to buy at least four homes from Mr. Kontogiannis, who required little or no down payments and then financed her mortgages, the officials said. Officials estimated the total value of the property at $1 million, although it was unclear whether Ms. Miller had made a profit on the real estate, which she has resold to the developer, according to her lawyer, Ira Cooper.</p>
        <p>The investigation, first reported yesterday in The New York Post, centers on business dealings between Ms. Miller and Mr. Kontogiannis, who is an associate of the president of the technology company that won the contracts, Kinson Tso, and whose wife is the landlord of the District 29 headquarters in Rosedale. The investigation is also focusing on the role of one of Mr. Kontogiannis's lawyers, Raymond Shain, who first told Ms. Miller about the technology company, according to her lawyer. Mr. Shain was paid as a consultant on two of the contracts and as a subcontractor on one, the law enforcement sources said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller is in a hospital recovering from surgery and cannot comment, according to Mr. Cooper.</p>
        <p>''What she did may have been an impropriety, but it was not a crime,'' Mr. Cooper said.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Tso nor Mr. Shain returned telephone calls to their offices yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kontogiannis denied any wrongdoing. He said Ms. Miller made down payments on the homes, all in Queens, and mortgage payments, adding, ''I never gave that woman one single dollar.''</p>
        <p>''This is too big of a lie,'' he said.</p>
