        <p>A JURY in Manhattan came down hard on Radovan Karadzic this week, ordering the former Bosnian Serb wartime leader to pay $4.5 billion in damages to victims of rape, torture and genocide.</p>
        <p>The case is one of a series of suits brought against foreign leaders by the Center for Constitutional Rights in recent years, all of which have had a similar outcome: a huge money judgment that everyone agrees will be impossible to collect.</p>
        <p>Everyone, that is, except Jennifer  Green, one of the lawyers who argued the Karadzic case in federal court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be hard,'' Ms. Green says -- an understatement, with Dr. Karadzic at large. And of the other cases, she says, ''No money has been collected yet.''</p>
        <p>You never say never, do you?</p>
        <p>''That's my attitude,'' Ms. Green, 38, says firmly. ''Look at the Holocaust cases that 50 years later are getting settled. The clients don't get involved because they expect to see a judgment tomorrow, they do it to hold the person accountable. And the judgment can have other effects besides the transfer of money. The case we had against Gramajo'' -- the former Guatemalan defense minister Hector Gramajo, sued for damages regarding murder and torture -- ''he was being groomed for the presidency of Guatemala, and he's no longer a candidate.''</p>
        <p>A pleasing memory, which makes the lawyer grin.</p>
        <p>''He was sued on his graduation day from the Harvard School of Public Policy, in '91. It was my graduation day, too -- I went to Harvard Law. There was a great picture of him being served in The Boston Globe. I showed it to my mother and said, 'This is what I'm going to do.' ''</p>
        <p>There are human rights types who are deadly serious. Then there is Jennifer Green. She is serious about her work, all right: there are 12-hour days, an office crowded with files, and of course the nightmare she had after the Karadzic trial ended. An interesting look into the soul of the lawyer, that nightmare.</p>
        <p>But she also laughs a lot, particularly at herself, little self-deprecating contrapuntals of, ''Yeah, right, Jen,'' or remonstrations for her Midwestern accent: ''God, I sound like Fargo, and they were two states away.''</p>
        <p>Home was the college town of Madison, Wis., where her father was an electrical engineer and her mother a teacher who was involved in social services. Ms. Green's mother may have pointed her toward activism -- looking out for an elder brother who was born with a heart defect and a learning disability made Ms. Green protective -- but it was Marlon Brando who took her concerns global.</p>
        <p>He blows into Wisconsin on behalf of the Menominee Indians, and before you know it Ms. Green is on the Amnesty International mailing list.</p>
        <p>AS for the Karadzic case, with which she has been involved since 1993, Ms. Green can tell you the stories of the 13 plaintiffs who testified, all of whom were Bosnian Muslims who suffered at the hands of Serb soldiers. Sometimes doing this, she uses the tag ''John'' or ''Jane,'' used in court to protect identities. Sometimes she skips a name, for there were many Johns and Janes who could not face the ordeal of testifying.</p>
        <p>''John One,'' Ms. Green begins, looking down, her arms folded protectively. ''Soldiers pulled his teeth out with pliers. He was forced to perform sexual acts with other male prisoners. He also testified about people being decapitated, then the soldiers forced them to play soccer with the people's heads. Yeah, they could be real creative. John Two, he was so badly beaten he has trouble now turning his head. John Three, he's a man named Dr. Emil Kapetanovic: he was forced to stand naked against the wall, also to play Russian roulette. They tortured him with the door open so other people could hear.''</p>
        <p>She turns, when that accounting is over, to the women.</p>
        <p>''Jane One, she was 16 years old at the Trnopolje concentration camp, taken out of a line where she was waiting for water and gang-raped. Jane Two and Three withdrew.''</p>
        <p>Moving on.</p>
        <p>''Jane Seven was waiting for a bus in Sarajevo with her husband -- we showed footage of the bombing in Sarajevo at the trial. The last thing she remembered was looking at her watch, then looking at her husband, who had been blown in half.''</p>
        <p>She talks about the pain involved in eliciting that testimony.</p>
        <p>''In terms of our clients, we were constantly on the alert for whether we were retraumatizing them in some way. Some questions you don't ask. There were issues about people having trouble sleeping.''</p>
        <p>How was it for the lawyers?</p>
        <p>''A couple of the others said they were having troubles with nightmares. I was O.K. until the trial ended; then it hit me.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Green's nightmare, the telling of which requires prompting:</p>
        <p>''Someone was being chased, I couldn't stop something from happening.'' A prompt. ''Someone was going to get killed, it was a kid, it was in the woods, which some of our clients had been describing. I came up and saw this thing happening.'' A prompt. ''No, it wasn't a gun. It looked like a knife. Then I woke up.''</p>
        <p>The nightmare recurred later the same night. The second time, though, Ms. Green was able to change the ending.</p>
        <p>What happened the second time?</p>
        <p>''I got the kid and ran.''</p>
