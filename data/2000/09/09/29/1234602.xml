        <p>Reassuring comments by Procter &amp; Gamble about earnings helped pull stock prices out of a late-September slide yesterday as two major gauges posted their biggest advance since May 30 and the Nasdaq market jumped 3.34 percent to regain more than half the ground lost in the preceding five sessions.</p>
        <p>Traders and investors were relieved that an unusually bloody quarter with many warnings about reduced corporate earnings was coming to an end.</p>
        <p>But much of the optimism evaporated after the formal 4 p.m. close when Apple Computer warned that its fourth-quarter earnings would be below estimates. Shares of Apple, which had climbed $4.56, to $53.50 during regular hours, plunged more than 24 percent to around $29.19 in after-hours trading.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index  gained 122.02 points, to 3,778.32, narrowed its decline so far this year to 7.15 percent.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index, which is also heavily weighted with technology issues, gained 31.72 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,458.29.</p>
        <p>For the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, which joined the S.&amp; P. in posting its biggest gain since late May, it was Procter &amp; Gamble and J. P. Morgan each accounting for more than 30 points of a surge totaling 195.70 points, or 1.8 percent. At 10,824.06, the Dow is 5.85 percent lower than at the end of last year.</p>
        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson, down $1.75, to $93.38, was the biggest drag on the Dow industrials, with Eastman Kodak, pummeled after warning of lower profits on Tuesday, losing another $1.19, to $41.31. Of the 30 Dow stocks, 23 advanced.</p>
        <p>Exodus Communications, which agreed to buy Global Crossing's Web unit, lost $4.13, to $49.13.</p>
        <p>Cisco Systems was the most actively traded stock, with 90.5 million shares changing hands. It closed at $59.31, up $2.00, after trading as low as $54.63.</p>
        <p>An analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  cut his rating of the stock and also that of Nortel Networks. Nortel rose $3.7213, to $63.00.</p>
        <p>Some financial stocks were standout gainers, with Lehman Brothers, Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan up more than five points each after it was announced that Dain Rauscher, up $13, to $92.88, was being sold to the Royal Bank of Canada.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Rise  By The Associated Press</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as oil prices continued a weeklong retreat and the government reported benign inflationary news.</p>
        <p>The 10-year Treasury note rose 3/32, to a price of 99 19/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.80 percent from 5.82 percent on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32, to 105 5/32. The bond's yield fell to 5.88 percent from 5.90 percent on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Crude oil futures plunged for a sixth consecutive session on expectations more supply will hit the market soon. November crude futures fell $1.12, to $30.34 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
        <p>High oil prices could slow the economy by reducing consumer discretionary spending and by helping fuel inflation.</p>
        <p>Bond investors also took comfort in economists' comments that a revised calculation by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the consumer price index would have little effect on the overall inflation picture.</p>
