        <p>IT is late morning on a muggy day in August. Most of New York City seems to be rushing to appointments or toiling in air-conditioned offices. But in a cramped, dusty East Village space on 13th Street, four people who make their lives working in the theater are talking about a hat.</p>
        <p>This is a costume meeting for the Classic Stage Company's production of ''I Will Bear Witness,'' a one-man adaptation of the diaries of Victor Klemperer. ''Witness'' is one of four productions that make up the company's current season, and this meeting is one of the countless, painstaking rituals of preparation that the company has gone through over the last several months to make it all come together.</p>
        <p>A nonprofit theater's season planning is a craft all its own, one of mundane logistical maneuvering as well as lofty creative ambition; of sleepless-night angst and pride-swelling triumph; of big-picture matters like building audiences and details as precise as choosing a hat. It's a balancing act of egos, schedules, budgets and creative visions. The process is happening at theaters all over the country and at many in New York, but it formally begins in earnest in the spring and ends in the fall. The planning is conducted at many levels, depending on an institution's finances. And it almost always involves a deep and consuming commitment of passion and time.</p>
        <p>At the 33-year-old Classic Stage Company, which has an operating budget of $1.3 million and is on a par with Off-Broadway companies like the Atlantic and the Vineyard, the first offering of this season, ''Texts for Nothing,'' started previews yesterday and opens on Oct. 15. It is a one-man performance of prose pieces by Samuel Beckett featuring and directed by Bill Irwin. After that is ''Race'' by Ferdinand Bruckner, about the effects of the Nazis' election on a group of medical students in Germany in 1933. This will be performed in repertory in February and March with ''I Will Bear Witness,'' which was adapted for the stage by Karen Malpede and George Bartenieff and will be performed by Mr. Bartenieff. These will be followed by ''In the Penal Colony,'' a music-theater work by Philip Glass based on Kafka's story, which will run in June and July.</p>
        <p>Watching this theater company create its season over the last six months offers a window into not only the running of a small nonprofit institution but also the making of art.</p>
        <p>March</p>
        <p>When Barry Edelstein, 35, was selected to be the artistic director of the Classic Stage Company in 1998, one of first things he did was call artists he had worked with in the past to say, essentially, ''I'm running this theater now; come work with me.'' The first of them was Mr. Irwin, perhaps best known for his performance with David Shiner in the hit Broadway show ''Fool Moon.'' Mr. Irwin had performed a version of ''Texts,'' developed by Joseph Chaikin, in 1991 at the Public Theater. He wanted to go a little further with the Beckett play, in which he brings his clowning skills to portraying a tramplike figure searching for his place in the universe.</p>
        <p>At this point, everything looks like a go: scheduling has been worked out, and the theater has agreed to Mr. Irwin's idea of building a large hillside with water and real dirt. Doug Stein will design the set. The one sticking point is getting the rights to the material from the Beckett estate, famously zealous in controlling the staging of the playwright's works. Mr. Irwin has had an exchange of letters with Beckett's nephew, Edward, in which Mr. Beckett has expressed some reservations about the project. In particular, he is opposed to any changes, and Mr. Irwin had hoped to perform 5 of the 13 original texts with a few minor excisions for pacing. This is nail-biting time; will Mr. Irwin get the green light or won't he?</p>
        <p>It looks promising, but projects do sometimes fall through. In just a few weeks, Classic Stage's original choice for its fourth slot, an adaptation of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses,'' which takes place in a giant swimming pool, will evaporate because of scheduling problems with the director, Mary Zimmerman.</p>
        <p>In choosing material, Mr. Edelstein says, several considerations are at work. First of all is scheduling. That includes questions like ''Is so-and-so free then?'' and ''Who's going to come downtown in May to see a play about the Nazis?'' But more important is the composition of a season. Classic Stage's mission is to present classics for contemporary American audiences, which means rewriting and reimagining works that already exist. The company's last two seasons have included ''Naked,'' by Luigi Pirandello; Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot''; and ''The Misanthrope'' by Moliere.</p>
        <p>''That's what makes my job exciting,'' Mr. Edelstein says. ''You're dealing at an incredibly abstract level with big philosophical questions: What is a classic? How does time intervene to change a piece of art? Then you have to find a community of artists who have perspective on that.''</p>
        <p>''What I'm trying to talk about is the deep inner heart of the play -- the way men and women relate, the way that power works, the questions that are at the heart of what the drama is talking about,'' Mr. Edelstein continues. ''You can slap a three-piece suit on Hamlet; does that make a contemporary work? I don't think so. Yes, these plays survive across time. But aspects of these plays don't, and when they don't you learn that society has changed. So thinking about a play from 400 years ago, you have an opportunity to think about our world.''</p>
        <p>April</p>
        <p>In planning a season, a theater also has ticket sales to consider, and featuring stars can help get people in the door. In the two seasons that Mr. Edelstein has been at Classic Stage, the company has featured Uma Thurman, Mira Sorvino and John Turturro. But he is frustrated because some people now associate Classic Stage with celebrities. ''Those are the ones that generate attention,'' he says.</p>
        <p>''The strategy is to cast the best actor for the part,'' he adds. ''Of course, it's also to explore exciting people we think audiences are going to want to see.''</p>
        <p>Stars also matter to Beth Emelson, 34, Mr. Edelstein's partner as the company's producing director, because she is concerned with building Classic Stage's audiences. ''Beth's challenge to me,'' Mr. Edelstein says, ''was, 'Give me two names people know in each season brochure.' ''</p>
        <p>Whether because of big names or because they simply like the shows, more and more people are coming to Classic Stage these days. In the last two years, the theater's membership has increased to 1,200 from 224. Classic Stage members -- who tend to be between the ages of 25 and 45 -- pay $25 a year and see any play for $20.</p>
        <p>Growth is important to the company because more money will allow for more shows with longer runs and larger casts. This year the theater's operating budget has grown to $1.3 million from $500,000. Ms. Emelson and Mr. Edelstein concluded their first year at the company with a surplus of $250,000, which was used to help pay off an eight-year debt of about $100,000, to increase the staff to seven from three, to buy computers and to upgrade dressing rooms.</p>
        <p>Without an advertising budget, Classic Stage has to be creative about getting the word out. Ms. Emelson devotes much of her time to reaching out to the Union Square neighborhood. She makes contact with colleges in the area like New York University, the New School and Baruch College, puts up posters in dormitories, gets material about the theater into orientation packets and speaks to professors about incorporating Classic Stage productions into the curriculum. This season, for example, Ms. Emelson has been talking to the German department at N.Y.U. about organizing a conference around Holocaust drama in connection with ''Race'' and ''Witness.'' ''It's a wasted opportunity if we don't,'' Ms. Emelson says.</p>
        <p>Other Classic Stage efforts include special student matinees for high school students; a program called Classic Stages/New Visions that presents new works on classic themes; Saturday symposiums at which scholars talk about topics related to a current Classic Stage play; and Tuesday Talks, at which the actors and designers meet with the audience after a show.</p>
        <p>In April the company started a Web site, www.classicstage.org.</p>
        <p>May</p>
        <p>Construction is about to begin. For the 33 years that Classic Stage has occupied a former stable on East 13th Street, no productions have been mounted in the summer because the theater had no air-conditioning and the heat was too much for audiences to bear. (Legend has it that during one season that ran into June, Mr. Turturro was forced to perform Brecht in a full-length leather coat on a 115-degree day and that the theater's board members had to spritz the audience.)</p>
        <p>Now, thanks to an $850,000 capital campaign that is also paying for a new lobby, renovated bathrooms and a raised ceiling, the theater will have not only central air but also central heat. In the past the theater used two gigantic gas blowers that were so loud they could be used only before performances and at intermission. While it may seem to most like an incidental upgrade, to the theater it is a seismic change; whereas Classic Stage functions 12 months of the year, it has been able to earn money only during seven -- from October through April. Now the theater will be able to produce shows year-round -- renting the space out to others as well as producing its own -- and its directors can hardly contain their excitement.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly it's a brand-new day in terms of what the calendar looks like,'' Ms. Emelson says. ''Up till now, a key resource in planning the season was the Farmer's Almanac -- what's it going to be like outside? And those days, happily, are gone.''</p>
        <p>Classic Stage was founded by Christopher Martin, who was followed as artistic director by Carey Perloff, then David Esbjornson. In June 1998, Mr. Edelstein heard that the position was open, threw his hat into the ring and got the job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edelstein, born and reared in Fairlawn, N.J., is a cerebral man with wire-rimmed glasses. He majored in drama at Tufts University, where he started directing, and on graduating in 1986 won a Rhodes Scholarship and earned a master's in philosophy from Oxford University, where he specialized in Shakespeare. After another year in London, Mr. Edelstein came to New York, worked at the Public Theater under Joseph Papp, taught Shakespearean acting at Juilliard and began directing. He eventually built a career as a freelance director -- working at Williamstown Theater Festival, the Roundabout Theater Company and the Public -- and he continues to direct plays. He did ''Julius Caesar'' in Central Park this summer and will do ''Race,'' which he also adapted, at Classic Stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edelstein says he wanted to run a theater because he was interested in having more control over his career. ''This is a place where I can do work I believe in on my own terms,'' he says. ''I have a home now.''</p>
        <p>He and Ms. Emelson both call their partnership strong, saying they consult on every decision, from the color of the lobby to how many season brochures to print and how best to approach a certain actor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Emelson, who radiates warmth and organization, is from California, Pa., the daughter of arts educators. She moved to New York City 14 years ago to attend N.Y.U., where she earned a degree in arts administration and theater management. Then came work at the Public, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Lincoln Center Theater.</p>
        <p>''There is a certain satisfaction in selling tickets and raising money -- that's part of the job, that's what's expected,'' Ms. Emelson says. ''But the part I most enjoy is working with writers and directors.''</p>
        <p>June</p>
        <p>With the Ovid play now off the schedule, Classic Stage is casting about for a production to fill its final slot. The company has had a reading of Neal Bell's play ''Monster,'' an adaptation of Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein.'' Another possibility is ''In the Penal Colony,'' a new music-theater piece by Philip Glass,  directed by JoAnne Akalaitis, with scenery by John Conklin and lighting by Jennifer Tipton -- what Mr. Edelstein calls a ''dream team of the avant-garde theater.'' The production is being staged first at A Contemporary Theater in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Classic Stage decides to go with the latter, excited to present the production's New York premiere and relieved that the season is finally set, though a bit nervous about pulling off something so ambitious. The show requires a live quintet -- which may turn out to be imported from Europe -- two opera singers and three actors. ''Nobody else in his right mind would try to do it,'' Mr. Edelstein says.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Edelstein is not worried about at this point is the fact that the season as a whole is looking grim, with two Holocaust plays and an opera about capital punishment coming on the heels of Beckett. Mr. Edelstein says he simply needs to feel good about each individual project -- and he does. ''My own philosophy is, in New York the whole notion of season planning is different,'' he says. ''In a city where you're the one major professional theater and there are five smaller theaters, then I think you know your 20,000 subscribers are going to see your entire season and in that case a pu pu platter is a good idea -- a little of this, a little of that. In New York, people don't experience theater in a seasonal way. You have members who see everything, and we do. But they are a relatively small proportion of our audience.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Edelstein says, he is not concerned with how the plays he selects relate to one another; he doesn't plan a season around a theme or any other common thread. ''There are people who regard season planning as a curatorial activity,'' he says. ''They've got to have these five plays dealing with war, or one play for every decade of the 20th century. Our view of this season is, 'Let's get great projects, each one of which is a legitimate response to our mission.' ''</p>
        <p>July</p>
        <p>At a meeting on ''Texts'' at the theater, amid the scaffolding and rubble of renovation, Mr. Irwin says he is optimistic about getting the necessary approval from Edward Beckett. ''I think we're in good shape,'' he says. ''I think I see my way clear to sending him something he will say yes to.'' Mr. Irwin is also clearly excited about the prose pieces from the original book, ''Stories and Texts for Nothing,'' that he has selected. ''Like the continent of Africa,'' he says. ''The more I read them, the deeper I can go.''</p>
        <p>''His respect for you as an artist is so profound that he's going to say yes,'' Mr. Edelstein predicts hopefully. Later in the month Mr. Beckett faxes Classic Stage permission to go ahead, but Mr. Irwin ultimately decides to perform the pieces without any cuts.</p>
        <p>They discuss the blurb about the play that will appear in the brochure. Mr. Irwin worries that it promises too much in the way of humor and suggests ''a drier tone.'' Mr. Edelstein says he has a drier version but adds that the idea is to get people to come. ''The preference has been to do a zippier version in the season brochure,'' he explains. ''I'm stressing witty because our season is Nazis and capital punishment. The comedy highlight is Samuel Beckett.''</p>
        <p>Appreciating this, Mr. Irwin nevertheless persists. ''I would hate,'' he says, ''to set up a false expectation.'' The blurb ends up being toned down.</p>
        <p>They go on to discuss costume designers. Will one be too busy because she is also doing a Broadway show? Another knows period costumes well, another has done Woody Allen films. ''You should meet them,'' Mr. Edelstein advises Mr. Irwin, ''and make the call.'' Mr. Irwin later decides on Anita Yavich.</p>
        <p>Then they talk about sound designers. Is this one ''too composery''? And stage managers. Is that one tough enough or too nice?</p>
        <p>Although ''Texts'' is a one-man show, Mr. Irwin -- whose work includes unorthodox physical techniques -- is interested in exploring the possibility of featuring a second set of hands that resemble his own. This idea is later eliminated, but for now the creative people worry about getting someone to take the job. ''I couldn't get a 50-year-old man to play Julius Caesar,'' Mr. Edelstein quips. ''I don't know how we're going to get a 50-year-old guy to play a hand for half the money.''</p>
        <p>August</p>
        <p>George Bartenieff discovered the brown fedora in a bin at the Barneys warehouse sale, and he is proud of the find; it is just right, he says, to help capture the painful transformation of his character, Victor Klemperer in ''I Will Bear Witness,'' from a distinguished scholar to just another downtrodden Jew suffering through the Holocaust with a yellow star sewn into his coat over his heart. ''A professor in his society was at the top of the rung,'' Mr. Bartenieff explains at the costume meeting in the temporary offices the company is using while the theater is being renovated. ''Even if he went into a grocer, they would call him professor.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, Classic Stage's production team gathers to talk nitty-gritty numbers. In addition to Mr. Edelstein and Ms. Emelson, those present are Angela Wendt, the costume designer for ''Race'' and ''Witness''; Rachel M. Tischler, the theater's new general manager; and Ian Tresselt, production manager.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wendt asks what her budget will be for the two shows. ''The whopping sum of $9,000 for both,'' Ms. Tischler reports. But Ms. Wendt, who designed ''Rent'' on Broadway, doesn't blink. Somehow, actors, directors and designers who work in the big time are also willing to lend their talents to a theater like Classic Stage for considerably less than their normal fees. Mr. Edelstein and Ms. Emelson often say it's because they make up in personal attention what they can't offer in compensation. But the creative people say it's because they simply go where the good work is.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the most exciting forays I've every made,'' Mr. Irwin says. ''And it's as well supported here as it could be anywhere in the world.''</p>
        <p>''The mortgage,'' Mr. Irwin adds, ''will have to be paid by some other kind of work.''</p>
        <p>September</p>
        <p>It's time for Classic Stage to give a progress report to its board. A table for the evening meeting has been set up in the lobby -- with hard hats as a humorous centerpiece. Ms. Emelson, typically covered with sawdust of late, is wearing high heels and pearls. Although ''Texts'' is to start performances in just a week and power tools are still whirring in the background, she seems typically upbeat.</p>
        <p>''This is where the eternal optimist of Beth Emelson ends up coming into play,'' she says. ''I really feel it's going to all get done.''</p>
        <p>Arriving at this point hasn't been easy. Ms. Emelson and Mr. Edelstein have been putting in 14-hour days, 7 days a week. And the schedule does not promise to get much lighter; both try to be in the lobby to greet people at nearly every performance. ''It's important for an audience not to perceive the theater as faceless,'' Mr. Edelstein says.</p>
        <p>The pressure is also on to raise money; this is the time of year that theaters make their big push to find financing. Ms. Emelson says she has sent out 130 proposals and letters seeking support from government agencies, corporations and individuals. In the first few months of running the theater, Ms. Emelson and Mr. Edelstein met ''with anybody who would open the door,'' she says. ''We were out there all the time with our dog-and-pony show.''</p>
        <p>Now they have established some reliable donors, but they never stop worrying about money and would like to build up a considerable cash reserve ''so the panic moments don't shake the place quite as much as they can,'' Mr. Edelstein says.</p>
        <p>It is working on projects like Mr. Irwin's, he explains, that makes all this worthwhile. ''Watching Bill is an incredible treat,'' Mr. Edelstein says. ''That's why I got into this, to be around artists like that. You watch him step onto that mountain and you can't believe your eyes. All the rest -- waiting for permits to come, sweating out the cash flow -- recedes far into the background when Bill Irwin does some crazy move with his shoulder.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Edelstein says, there is no shortage of things to be nervous about: Will the renovation be finished? Will the season stick? Will people buy tickets? Will critics like the shows? Will audiences show up? ''There's always something to keep you awake at night, to turn your hair gray,'' says Mr. Edelstein, whose hair does seem to be looking a little grayer.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sleeping because I'd much rather be awake,'' he adds. ''I love what I do when I wake up in the morning. So who needs to sleep? I'd rather be here.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, this is a moment for Classic Stage that happens to be full of promise, when all the pieces seem as if they might actually have fallen into place. ''What a relief, we've got a season,'' Mr. Edelstein says. ''And there you go -- we're finished.''</p>
