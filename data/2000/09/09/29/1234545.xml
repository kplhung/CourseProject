        <p>SOME Olympic days are more defining than others. Yesterday was one of those days -- and one of those nights -- of clarity that brings fleeting insight into the essence of the Olympic spirit.</p>
        <p>Not of the spirit that the International Olympic Committee shamelessly sells and parcels out. Not of the spirit that compels some athletes to load up with drugs. This was a glimpse into the spirit of competition, of what the Australians call the ''fair go.'' This is what you don't see when watching the television coverage.</p>
        <p>This was the evening of Day 14, a night when Marion Jones won her second gold medal, a night when Konstantinos Kenteris became the first Greek man to win a gold in a running event, the 200 meters, since 1896, a night when Cuba's men broke the American domination in the long jump.</p>
        <p>Jones cruised home in the 200 with the fastest time in the world this year, 21.84 seconds.</p>
        <p>The silver medalist, Pauline Davis-Thompson of the Bahamas, was so into the moment that she began crying tears of joy as soon as she realized that she had finished second. When she stepped up to get her medal, her mind was exploding with the names and faces of all the people who helped get her there.</p>
        <p>This was a night when you learned a little more about Jones, whose husband, C. J. Hunter, is involved in a controversy concerning his failed tests for a performance-enhancing drug.</p>
        <p>Jones puts on the good public face and seems authentic.</p>
        <p>When the stadium announcer made a mistake before the 200-meter final and introduced her as an athlete from the Bahamas, Jones shrugged her shoulders and smiled. Then she went out and beat everyone by 13 feet. She ran one race and the rest of the field ran another.</p>
        <p>Afterward, someone asked Jones if, in light of the news about Hunter, she was afraid people might think she wasn't clean.</p>
        <p>''No, I don't have that fear,'' she said evenly. ''The people that know me, the people that support me, train with me and coach me, know that I'm a clean athlete.''</p>
        <p>Someone else asked about the source of her focus, her ability to block out distractions. She said her goals give her the focus she needs.</p>
        <p>''I'm here to prove to myself that it's possible to walk away from Sydney with five gold medals,'' she said. ''This has been a dream of mine for a lot of years, and so to let one event ruin your life, as dramatic as it might be, that wouldn't be worth it at all. All the days my mother would travel four or five hours to take me to a track. To let one event ruin it -- no way. No way.''</p>
        <p>During the interviews, Jones accepted good-natured teasing and gave it back.</p>
        <p>When Davis-Thompson said, in one of her extended answers, ''I'm outspoken,'' Jones grabbed the microphone and said with mock surprise, ''Noooo!''</p>
        <p>Later, when the subject of the women's 4x100 relay came up, Davis-Thompson said: ''We are still the underdog and we love being in that spot. It's just going to make our victory a little bit sweeter, Marion.''</p>
        <p>Then she added: ''I know you have a little bit of Caribbean blood in you, too, Marion'' -- alluding to Jones's mother's Belizean heritage -- ''so you're almost like one of us.''</p>
        <p>The room broke up and Jones lowered her head and laughed.</p>
        <p>Grace and ease.</p>
        <p>Davis-Thompson was asked to compare Jones with the late Florence Griffith Joyner, since she had run against both of them. ''They're both very dominant,'' she said. ''Marion seems more down to earth.''</p>
        <p>Just before the women's 200, I had been to the tennis site to listen to Serena and Venus talk about their gold medal performance in doubles. Serena spoke of walking around and watching the performances of other great athletes, and how it enabled her to see herself, and her accomplishments, in a larger context.</p>
        <p>Jones said that context is what makes this more than a mere track meet, more than a tennis tournament where athletes are sequestered in their own worlds.</p>
        <p>''Just getting a chance to meet fellow American athletes who I have never met and probably will never meet again, from rowers to judo experts, from everyone,'' she said. ''Even the big stars, the men's basketball team, the women's basketball team. Venus, Serena, Monica, Lindsay. To see how humble they were really puts this whole thing in perspective.''</p>
        <p>When the news conference broke up, the other sprinters stayed and chatted. Jones sprang up, and the soft smile gave way to an all-business gaze. In an instant she was gone.</p>
        <p>Who knows what Days 15 to 18 hold.</p>
        <p>Day 14, off camera, was pretty impressive.</p>
