        <p>Testimony concluded yesterday in Marty McSorley's assault trial in Vancouver, British Columbia, with the player set to learn the judge's verdict next Friday.</p>
        <p>McSorley, 37, who has played in the National Hockey League for 17 seasons, could get up to one and a half years in prison if convicted of assault for clubbing Vancouver's Donald Brashear in the head during a game on Feb. 21 between the Boston Bruins and the Canucks.</p>
        <p>The judge will try to determine whether such an attack in an N.H.L. game constitutes assault. Brashear sustained a concussion but has fully recovered.</p>
        <p>The former Boston player Steve Heinze testified yesterday that hits to the head are a common occurrence in the N.H.L.</p>
        <p>''You always get your bell rung a few times a season,'' said Heinze, who now plays for the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets. ''Pinpoint accuracy is not something that occurs as a guy is flying by you. You can only aim for a spot.''</p>
        <p>His testimony was intended to reinforce McSorley's claims that he intended only to hit Brashear in the upper shoulder. McSorley was fined $72,000 and suspended for the final 23 games of last season by the N.H.L. He is now an unrestricted free agent. (AP)</p>
        <p>DWYER SUSPENDED FOR 23 GAMES: Tampa Bay left wing Gordie Dwyer was suspended without pay by the N.H.L. for 23 games, including the Lightning's first 21 regular-season games, for leaving the penalty box and making contact with officials during a preseason game against Washington Sept. 19.</p>
        <p>Dwyer will be eligible to return Nov. 27 against the Islanders. He will forfeit $39,510 in salary, the N.H.L. said. Dwyer made contact with the linesman David Brisebois during a fight with Capitals defenseman Joe Reekie. While serving his penalty, he left the penalty box and tried to fight Reekie again, but knocked the referee Mark Faucette to the ice. (Bloomberg News)</p>
