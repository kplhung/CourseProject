        <p>It may not be down in writing but censorious fig leaves placed over genitals probably weren't what the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier had in mind five years ago when he formulated his so-called Vow of Chastity, the set of stringent movie-making rules known as Dogma 95.</p>
        <p>Mr. von Trier, whose ''Dancer in the Dark'' opened the New York Film Festival last week, seeks to purge the frills and tricks and anything else remotely Hollywood from the process. Presumably, that would include the requirements of the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, which mandates that genitalia be covered if a film is to receive an R instead of an NC-17.</p>

        <p>It may not be down in writing but censorious fig leaves placed over genitals probably weren't what the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier had in mind five years ago when he formulated his so-called Vow of Chastity, the set of stringent movie-making rules known as Dogma 95.</p>
        <p>Mr. von Trier, whose ''Dancer in the Dark'' opened the New York Film Festival last week, seeks to purge the frills and tricks and anything else remotely Hollywood from the process. Presumably, that would include the requirements of the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, which mandates that genitalia be covered if a film is to receive an R instead of an NC-17.</p>
        <p>And covered they are in Mr. von Trier's ''Idiots,'' which will be released on Tuesday by USA Home Entertainment. To get the R before short theater runs in New York and Los Angeles, USA Films added black patches when and where required in the movie, which follows a commune of well-to-do Nordic layabouts who wander about irritating the bourgeoisie by acting as if they are mentally retarded.</p>
        <p>Often a video is released in R and unrated or NC-17 versions, but not in this case. The black squares remain in the one and only ''Idiots,'' still rated R. A spokeswoman for USA said that there was no consumer interest in an unrated version.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to say what's more idiotic,'' A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times, ''a director who treats his audience like uptight prigs in need of a gratuitous shock, or an industry organization that treats filmgoers like children.''</p>
        <p>Double Scare</p>
        <p>''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' is one of two big new re-issues for Tuesday. The midnight staple is 25 years old, ripe for a commemorative tape and two-disc DVD from Fox with soundtracks enough to let one shout along with the mobs in the theater.</p>
        <p>The other film is ''Rosemary's Baby'' (1968). ''It opens like a Doris Day movie; that was the whole point,'' said Richard Sylbert, the production designer on a new DVD and tape from Paramount. Having completed ''Dance of the Vampires'' (a k a ''Pardon Me but Your Teeth Are in My Neck'') the year before, Roman Polanski, the director, said he was looking away from horror and more toward making a skiing movie -- Robert Redford in ''Downhill Racer,'' perhaps.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Redford was considered for the role of Guy Woodhouse in ''Rosemary's Baby'' before Mr. Polanski decided that a harder, darker New York type like John Cassevetes would better portray the ambitious actor who accepts Satan's help with his career in return for letting the devil father his child.</p>
        <p>In the beginning Rosemary was envisioned as a ''milk-fed American girl,'' far from the gaunt young woman portrayed by Mia Farrow. Mr. Polanski said that when he first read the script, adapted from Ira Levin's novel, he thought it was a soap opera. The film still has a remarkably sunny look. ''The great horror film without any horror in it,'' Mr. Sylbert said.</p>
