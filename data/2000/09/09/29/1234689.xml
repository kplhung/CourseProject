        <p>'A Romantic Comedy'  Directed by Greg Berlanti  R; 94 minutes</p>
        <p>The circle of gay best friends portrayed in Greg Berlanti's ''Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy'' is bound together by many things, one of which is the pleasure these young men of West Hollywood take in playing conversational games.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlanti introduces them in the middle of a spirited round of ''Who Can Act Straight the Longest?,'' in which the players exchange aggressively butch observations about sports, beer and the best bars for picking up women, until one of them loses by revealing an Obviously Gay Trait -- or O.G.T., in the shorthand slang, which Mr. Berlanti captures with entertaining, anthropological precision.</p>
        <p>The central figure in the group is Dennis (Timothy Olyphant), a photographer facing his 28th birthday with the vague sense that it is time to grow up and settle down, though he has no clear idea of how to go about it. No longer content with the pursuit of casual sex and physical beauty, he yearns for commitment and stability in a romantic relationship, commodities not easily available in the bar scene of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Dennis's friends include the compulsively seductive, contentedly superficial actor Cole (Dean Cain, the Superman of television's ''Lois and Clark''); Benji (Zach Braff), a spiky-haired punk with a weakness for musclemen; the furrow-browed Patrick (Ben Weber), who worries that he isn't good-looking enough; Howie (Matt McGrath), a graduate student who fatally overanalyzes his relationships; and the self-dramatizing Taylor (Billy Porter), a professional cook still milking a recent breakup.</p>
        <p>Acting as a father figure to the group is the wise, patient Jack (John Mahoney), the gay proprietor of a restaurant where many of the characters work, and the manager of the softball team -- the Broken Hearts -- that gives the film its title.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlanti's previous experience includes a stint writing for the television series ''Dawson's Creek,'' and his film -- his debut as a writer-director -- reflects a benign television sensibility. It plays almost like a pilot for a potential series, with its cast of immediately identifiable and likable characters, its way of weaving in and out of several different subplots and its cozy sense of family and belonging, which it extends to the viewer.</p>
        <p>The downside of this style is an unfortunate, shorthandlike way of writing off minor figures as caricatures and a certain emotional glibness expressed through facile, heart-tugging plot devices like funeral gatherings and near-fatal accidents -- time-honored ways of provoking feelings that the material doesn't quite justify.</p>
        <p>''The Broken Hearts Club'' may find its real model in ''Steel Magnolias,'' the 1989 Herbert Ross melodrama that featured Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah and Julia Roberts as the pillars of a Southern beauty salon.  One of the games that Mr. Berlanti's characters like to play is to cast one  another in an imaginary West Hollywood remake of the Ross film, and the match between the various parts is sometimes harrowingly close.</p>
        <p>Like ''Steel Magnolias,'' ''The Broken Hearts Club'' emerges as an engaging if occasionally hokey inspirational melodrama about the importance of community in the face of life's disappointments.</p>
        <p>''The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes  strong language and sexual situations.</p>
