        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>LIEBERMAN CONTINUES CRITICISM  Senator Joseph I. Lieberman accused Republicans yesterday of deceiving voters about the Democratic plan to pay for prescription drugs, the second time this week he has called them dishonest. ''What Bush and Cheney are saying about our Medicare plan is downright deceptive,'' Mr. Lieberman said, joined by other Democratic lawmakers on the steps of the United States Capitol.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, he said Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney had repeatedly made promises that were contradicted by ''their records and the details of their plans.''</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>LIEBERMAN CONTINUES CRITICISM  Senator Joseph I. Lieberman accused Republicans yesterday of deceiving voters about the Democratic plan to pay for prescription drugs, the second time this week he has called them dishonest. ''What Bush and Cheney are saying about our Medicare plan is downright deceptive,'' Mr. Lieberman said, joined by other Democratic lawmakers on the steps of the United States Capitol.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, he said Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney had repeatedly made promises that were contradicted by ''their records and the details of their plans.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore has proposed adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Mr. Bush has derided the plan as forcing older people into a government-run health maintenance organization and has proposed a more limited program.</p>

        <p>THE ADVERTISEMENTS</p>
        <p>BROTHER AGAINST BROTHER  Handgun Control Inc. will begin broadcasting television commercials this weekend that feature the actor Martin Sheen criticizing Gov. George W. Bush's record on gun control.</p>
        <p>In the 30-second commercial, Mr. Sheen, who portrays the president on the television series ''The West Wing,'' sits in front of an American flag and says: ''Should the next president be the candidate of the gun lobby? Should he have signed a bill that allows hidden handguns in churches, hospitals and amusement parks? Should he be someone of whom the N.R.A. has said, that if he is elected, they'll be working right out of the Oval Office? That's Governor Bush's record.''</p>
        <p>One reason Handgun Control sought Mr. Sheen is that his brother Joseph Estevez did the voice-over for a commercial opposing gun control produced by a gun industry group, said Joseph Sudbay, the group's political director. Mr. Sudbay said Handgun Control has bought more than $300,000 in time on stations in Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis. The commercials have been timed to coincide with the season premier of ''The West Wing.'' Last season's finale featured an assassination attempt on Mr. Sheen's character.</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>Economic expansion is over if Vice President Al Gore becomes president, Gov. George W. Bush told supporters in Michigan and Wisconsin. Mr. Gore, in Washington, said as much of Mr. Bush. The candidates continue racking up frequent flier miles, wooing voters and hacking away at their opponents' credibility.</p>
        <p>Here are the stats:</p>
        <p>Length of the Official Day: Gore, 13 1/2 hours; Bush, 13 hours</p>
        <p>States Visited: Gore, 1; Bush, 2</p>
        <p>Towns and Cities Visited: Gore, 1; Bush, 2</p>
        <p>Events: Gore, 1; Bush, 2</p>
        <p>Press Conferences/Press Availability: Gore, 0; Bush, 0</p>
        <p>Press Interviews (Includes newspaper and television interviews): Gore, 5; Bush, 0</p>
        <p>Debate preparation: Gore, 1 hour; Bush, 0 hours</p>
        <p>Main message: Gore, economics; Bush, economic agenda, budget comparisons</p>
