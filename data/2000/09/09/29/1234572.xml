        <p>A federal judge threw out part of the government's suit against the tobacco industry today, narrowing the avenues by which the Justice Department can seek billions of dollars in damages.</p>
        <p>The judge, Gladys Kessler of Federal District Court here, dismissed two counts in the Justice Department suit, rejecting theories that the government could use two statutes enacted some four decades ago to recover money spent on smoking-related health care. Those statutes empower the government to seek damages from outside parties it deems responsible for medical expenses borne by the taxpayers.</p>
        <p>But Judge Kessler declined to throw out two other counts accusing the industry of operating a ''racketeering enterprise'' and seeking recovery of ill-gotten gains.</p>
        <p>Each side issued a statement saying it was happy.</p>
        <p>''We look forward to proceeding to trial and holding the tobacco companies accountable for the fraudulent conduct alleged in this lawsuit,'' said David W. Ogden, the assistant attorney general who heads the Justice Department's Civil Division.</p>
        <p>William S. Ohlemeyer, vice president and associate general counsel for Philip Morris, one of the defendants in the suit, called today's ruling ''an important first step in the ultimate dismissal of the case.''</p>
        <p>A government official who commented on condition he not be quoted by name had this perspective: ''Would we rather have had a one-line ruling saying that the motion to dismiss is denied? Sure. But this is still a big lawsuit.''</p>
        <p>The judge said as much. ''While the government's theories of liability have been limited,'' she wrote, ''the extent of defendants' potential liability remains, in the estimation of both parties, in the billions of dollars.''</p>
        <p>The government suit was filed last September and sought to use the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the Medical Care Recovery Act and provisions of the Medicare Secondary Payer statute to pry money from the tobacco companies.</p>
        <p>Rejecting the government's efforts to use the last two, Judge Kessler concluded that Congress had not intended those laws to be used the way the Justice Department sought to employ them.</p>
        <p>Referring to the Medical Care Recovery Act of 1962, she noted ''its total nonenforcement by the Department of Justice for 37 of those 38 years.''</p>
        <p>In ruling that the RICO portion of the suit could proceed, the judge held that the government had established a sufficient basis for its claims, ''which is all it must do at this early stage.''</p>
        <p>The suit is the first the government has filed against an entire industry using the RICO statute. The statute was enacted 30 years ago to fight organized crime, although federal prosecutors have more recently used it against businesses and others it contends have engaged in a pattern of illegal acts.</p>
        <p>The government sees such a pattern going back to at least 1953 among the tobacco companies. It accuses them of promoting biased research, wrongly asserting that nicotine was not addictive and aiming their products at children.</p>
        <p>When the suit was filed last year, Attorney General Janet Reno accused the companies of engaging in ''a campaign designed to preserve their enormous profits whatever the cost in human lives, human suffering and medical resources.''</p>
        <p>The tobacco industry has accused the government of ''politically correct extortion,'' as Greg Little, a top Philip Morris lawyer put it a year ago, and of bullying an entire industry in a way it has treated no other legal enterprise.</p>
        <p>The suit is separate from the cases that resulted in settlements totaling some $246 billion that the tobacco industry reached with various states in 1998 over smoking-related Medicaid costs for the poor and disabled.</p>
        <p>In addition to Philip Morris, a division of the Philip Morris Companies, the defendants are R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; the former American Tobacco Company; the Brown &amp;  Williamson Tobacco Corporation, a division of British American Tobacco P.L.C.; the Lorillard Tobacco Company, a division of Loews; the Liggett Group, a division of the Vector Group; the Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. Inc.; and the Tobacco Institute Inc.</p>
        <p>Judge Kessler rejected a request by the Liggett Group to exempt it from the racketeering suit on grounds it broke with other tobacco companies four years ago and settled with several states.</p>
        <p>Anti-tobacco groups expressed pleasure at today's ruling. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said it hoped that Congress would not succumb to pressure to cut off money to pay for the Justice Department suit.</p>
        <p>''Taxpayers deserve their day in court to hold the tobacco companies responsible for their illegal behavior,'' the organization said.</p>
