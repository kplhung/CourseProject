        <p>The movie screen lifted dramatically yesterday, and there was the first head coach of the New York/New Jersey Hitmen, Rusty Tillman, hunkered on a bar stool, hair shorn almost to the scalp, dressed in a tough-guy black suit with a black shirt.</p>
        <p>Then Tillman tugged on a black cap and began to talk, and there was no slowing him down.</p>

        <p>The movie screen lifted dramatically yesterday, and there was the first head coach of the New York/New Jersey Hitmen, Rusty Tillman, hunkered on a bar stool, hair shorn almost to the scalp, dressed in a tough-guy black suit with a black shirt.</p>
        <p>Then Tillman tugged on a black cap and began to talk, and there was no slowing him down.</p>
        <p>The more excited he gets, the redder he gets, and that's what this is all about, said Drew Pearson, the general manager of the Hitmen, the local franchise of the new football league, the XFL, bankrolled by the World Wrestling Federation and NBC.</p>
        <p>Well, that is at least what the marketing part of the XFL is all about. The league, which begins play next February, is selling itself as a brand of pro football that will have more sizzle than the National Football League.</p>
        <p>Tillman said one of the rule changes that the new league is thinking about is prohibiting a fair catch on punts.</p>
        <p>''We might have to go to the toughest parts of New York to find a punt returner,'' Tillman said, smiling.</p>
        <p>But the people behind the XFL also know that the best way to make the league successful is to stock its front offices with people with N.F.L. experience.</p>
        <p>Tillman, 53, worked as an assistant coach in the N.F.L. for more than 20 years; he was a defensive coordinator in Seattle, Tampa Bay and Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>Pearson also announced yesterday that Joe Mack, who had evaluated players for the Redskins, Panthers and Browns, would join the Hitmen as their director of player personnel.</p>
