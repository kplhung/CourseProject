        <p>In the first debates of the Republican primaries, Gov. George W. Bush did not have to do much. With six candidates dividing an hour and a half, no one got more than 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Bush filled up even less than that, his diaphanous answers sometimes ending many seconds before the allotted time. And while his opponents talked longer and louder  during those early December meetings, few seemed as self-satisfied as the Texas governor. His lips twisted into an expression that opponents  quickly branded ''the smirk.''</p>
        <p>Within two months, however, he had grafted a layer of earnestness over any arrogance for his ninth debate, a special edition of CNN's ''Larry King Live.'' There were just two other contenders left at that point. But Mr. Bush was suddenly a font of interjections and rebuttals, as if he had to rush to fit in all that he had to say.</p>
        <p>As he approaches his first debate with Vice President Al Gore in Boston next week, it is impossible to know which incarnation of Mr. Bush will show up.</p>
        <p>He and his aides are hoping for the better version, and will devote much of the weekend to debate preparation. It is their final push in a process that began last spring, and it is a recognition both that the campaign is entering a new phase, to be dominated by the three debates between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, and that these events represent Mr. Bush's best chance to erase any lingering questions about how serious and seasoned he really is.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Gore is a well-known quantity in this arena, a fresh, thorough review of Mr. Bush's 10 debates during the primaries and his two earlier debates in Texas showed him to be an unpredictable, uneven performer. At the same time, it revealed someone who, despite his image in some quarters as an overconfident slacker, can be capable of significant improvements, important adjustments and little surprises.</p>
        <p>''The jury is still kind of out on Bush,'' said Greg Mueller, who was a senior adviser to the publisher Steve Forbes, one of Mr. Bush's former rivals for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mueller was referring to Mr. Bush's aptitude for debates, but he said there was one clear lesson from the primaries: Mr. Bush brings weapons to the battle that should not be overlooked.</p>
        <p>Foremost among them is his talent for humorous asides, some cleverly self-effacing and some clearly spontaneous, and Mr. Bush drew on this with increasing frequency and effectiveness as he progressed through the debates last winter.</p>
        <p>At his fourth one, in early January, he was asked, ''Would you take an expression like 'What would Jesus do?' into the Oval Office?''</p>
        <p>''I would take an expression into the Oval Office of 'Dear God, help me,' '' Mr. Bush answered, without missing a beat.</p>
        <p>When Gary L. Bauer, another rival, muttered that the same thought would go through his head if Mr. Bush were president, Mr. Bush again found a fast and fitting retort.</p>
        <p>''That wasn't very Christian of you,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush also, in the same forum, mispronounced ''obfuscate,'' even though he was following his habit of edging up slowly to multisyllable clusters of consonants, as if pondering dangerous potholes on his oratorical highway.</p>
        <p>That error demonstrated one of his debate liabilities: a wobbliness (and sometimes wackiness) with words that was present even in the Larry King performance, when Mr. Bush signaled his commitment to a growing economy by saying, ''We ought to make the pie higher.''</p>
        <p>His debates to date form a fairly apt metaphor for his candidacy and, really, for his political identity.</p>
        <p>At his worst, Mr. Bush came across as cocky, tongue-tied and only glibly engaged with the nuts and bolts of the matters at hand. At his best, he projected a genuineness of belief, buoyancy of spirit and affability of character that trumped any of his opponents' charms.</p>
        <p>At all times, he leaned -- arguably a few inches further than other candidates do -- on transparently scripted, broad statements about his principles and qualifications, no matter what he had been asked.</p>
        <p>The most memorable example was his answer, in a December debate in Phoenix, to a question about what he had learned from a biography of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson that he had previously said he was reading. Mr. Bush simply reverted to foreign-policy lines from his stump speeches.</p>
        <p>But his aides and advisers are not talking much these days about that balance sheet of strengths and weaknesses; they are too busy building Mr. Gore into the most fearsome forensic gladiator in the empire.</p>
        <p>In recent interviews, one of them called the vice president ''the most effective and lethal debater in modern presidential politics.'' Several others said Mr. Bush would be lucky simply to remain upright in the face of Mr. Gore's onslaught.</p>
        <p>The name of this game is the management of expectations, and Mr. Bush's associates played it perfectly in 1994, when he was running for Texas governor against a quick-witted incumbent, Ann Richards.</p>
        <p>A recent look at the sole Bush-Richards debate that year left little doubt that she was funnier, more agile with facts, and more authoritative. And some of Mr. Bush's canned goods verged on hokey, as when he concluded his remarks by quoting the state song, ''Texas, our Texas, all hail the mighty state.''</p>
        <p>But he had never previously engaged in a formal debate, so the fact that he stood his ground and stated his platform succinctly, clearly and sometimes even forcefully impressed many skeptical observers.</p>
        <p>''Nobody thought he won,'' said Bill Miller, a political strategist in Austin, who has worked for both Democrats and Republicans. ''But nobody said, 'Gee, Richards just wiped the floor with this guy,' so he came out of it well.''</p>
        <p>Several weeks later, he defeated Ms. Richards in the election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's advisers are now trying to create a similar dynamic.</p>
        <p>They can, and will, tell anyone who asks that since 1984, Mr. Gore has debated about 45 times. They can,  and will, recite chapter and verse of a long article about Mr. Gore's evolution as a debater in the July issue of Atlantic Monthly, the cover of which depicted the vice president as a political vampire.</p>
        <p>But many of Mr. Bush's advisers acknowledge that behind the scenes, Mr. Bush has been practicing and practicing, to a degree that is not wholly characteristic.</p>
        <p>During the primaries, for example, he did not bother with a single mock debate. For the general election, he began such rehearsals about four months ago, several advisers said. In May, he sat with aides in the governor's mansion in Austin and watched a videotape, edited by the campaign's chief media adviser, Mark McKinnon, that included scenes from Mr. Gore's debates as well as high points from past presidential debates.</p>
        <p>In early June, he and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the stand-in for Mr. Gore, actually stood at lecterns in a room at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport, Me. It was a scenario repeated over subsequent months, with Stuart Stevens, another media adviser with the campaign, acting as a moderator.</p>
        <p>On Friday night, at Mr. Bush's ranch near Waco, he and Mr. Gregg will hold a timed rehearsal at the same late hour as Tuesday's event, a dry run that will test him past his usual bedtime. They may do a second rehearsal on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Advisers said that one goal of all this work had been to brief Mr. Bush thoroughly on the details of Mr. Gore's record and proposals. But another goal has been simply to make sure that Mr. Bush goes into Tuesday's debate feeling as comfortable as possible, because that often dictates whether he seems clipped or convivial, herky-jerky or fluid.</p>
        <p>Many political analysts said that the way he showcased his personality would be a key to his success.</p>
        <p>''His forte is not speed or specificity,'' said Roderick P. Hart, a University of Texas professor of communication and government who has observed Mr. Bush through the years. ''But contrary to popular reports, he's an intelligent man.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Hart said, ''he has some of that genial quality that President Reagan had in debates.''</p>
        <p>The debates in the primaries bear out that assessment. Some of Mr. Bush's best moments came when he relaxed enough to unleash a playful streak that made him seem accessible and smart and accomplished other goals as well.</p>
        <p>In late January, in his eighth debate, he responded to several of Mr. Forbes's attacks on his Texas record by saying, ''So many half stories, so little time.''</p>
        <p>It was the kind of Reaganesque, ''there-you-go-again'' line that is certain to be trotted out on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the last debate, on March 2, he drew laughter and applause when he answered a question about his familiarity with the Internet by saying that he ''e-mailed my mother the other day.''</p>
        <p>''She told me to stand straight, by the way, when I was at your debate,'' he added. It was a quick, self-effacing and humorous way to work his family connections.</p>
        <p>But this was also the debate in which Mr. Bush went a laugh too far, chuckling when one of his questioners mentioned that some death row convicts in Texas had had lawyers who slept during their trials.</p>
        <p>A more persistent trait of Mr. Bush's responses was his tendency to talk about foreign policy in the most general, well-worn terms. When Mr. King asked about the appropriate occasions for military force, Mr. Bush lapsed into a kind of mantra.</p>
        <p>''When it's in our national strategic interest,'' he said. ''The Far East is in our national strategic interest. Our own hemisphere is in our national strategic interests. The Middle East, protecting Israel, is in our national security interest.''</p>
        <p>The answer, to many observers, was much safer than it was illuminating.</p>
