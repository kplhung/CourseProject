        <p>If anyone bothered to turn on one of the four television sets hanging from the ceiling in the visitors' clubhouse here tonight, the Yankees would have known whether they were about to clinch the American League East.

        <p>But the TV screens were empty and the Yankees dressed in almost total silence here, preoccupied with their own vulnerability after sinking even more deeply into their late-season slump.

        <p>If anyone bothered to turn on one of the four television sets hanging from the ceiling in the visitors' clubhouse here tonight, the Yankees would have known whether they were about to clinch the American League East. They would have known whether Chicago eliminated Boston, once and for all.</p>
        <p>But the TV screens were empty and the Yankees dressed in almost total silence here, preoccupied with their own vulnerability after sinking even more deeply into their late-season slump. They had just suffered a three-game sweep by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, obliterated again tonight, 11-3, in a game started by their ace, Roger Clemens.</p>
        <p>It was the Yankees' fourth consecutive defeat, their 12th loss in 15 games and the sixth time in 15 games that they have been beaten by eight or more runs.</p>
        <p>The Yankees boarded the bus to the airport, on their way to Baltimore, when the Red Sox finally edged the White Sox, 7-6. Not that it matters to baseball's supermen, who have seemingly lost their powers and don't understand why.</p>
        <p>''Who cares what Boston does?'' Derek Jeter said sharply before leaving Tropicana Field. ''If we don't win, we don't go anywhere, and that's how you have to look at it. If you played like that, anybody would beat you.''</p>
        <p>Said Manager Joe Torre: ''Unfortunately, we're making other people do our job.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees look helpless, with the playoffs scheduled to start next week. Incredibly, they edged closer to wrapping up the division during their debacle here. The Toronto Blue Jays were eliminated when they lost to Baltimore, 23-1. If Boston loses one more game, or the Yankees win one more game, the Yankees will clinch.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees left here without their 72 bottles of Champagne. They had already boarded their plane when word flashed to them that the Red Sox are still alive.</p>
        <p>''My parents said they won, 7-6,'' said reliever Jeff Nelson. ''Is that true? Is that a final?''</p>
        <p>There is no chance George Steinbrenner would participate in even a muted celebration, however. He has owned the spotlight in times of celebration during the Yankees' rebirth over the last five years, but as Tampa Bay whipped his team tonight, Steinbrenner sat near the back of his private box, a silhouette on television screens, and walked out of Tropicana Field before the eighth inning.</p>
        <p>His anger has occasionally boiled over through this strange season, but he has been relatively sedate the last couple of days. There is nothing he can do now, of course; the Yankees will either rebound or their reign will end.</p>
        <p>The Yankees abandoned their clubhouse quickly Wednesday after Tampa Bay crushed them, a loss variously described by the players and Torre as humiliating, embarrassing, disgusting. Torre said he was disappointed and hung the wreath of defeat on the pitching; Torre leans toward the notion that the slump is mostly the result of poor pitching, given that the Yankees have allowed 114 runs in 15 games, an average of more than seven runs per game.</p>
        <p>Others offered different reasons. Reliever Mike Stanton said that since the Yankees swept the series in Boston earlier this month, ''the intensity we had up until that point hasn't been there.''</p>
        <p>Stanton continued: ''I think there was a big exhale once this Boston series was over. It's like the old parable: You push to row upstream in a river, and you don't stop rowing once you get to where you want. You have to keep pushing, and for a short time, we've stopped rowing.''</p>
        <p>They are being swept away in the last days of the regular season, and there is a growing sense of desperation as they try to stop the regression.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' players were particularly animated in the dugout before Wednesday's game, Torre sensing that they were trying to build some energy, and the defeat seemed to make them even more determined.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get the sense that was just another loss,'' said Stanton.</p>
        <p>Tonight, a platoon of Clemens's teammates watched him finish his warmups and offered him high-fives and encouragement as he walked by. The Yankees were sending their ace to the mound, they were all very serious and very determined and over the last five years, that has usually been enough.</p>
        <p>And everything went wrong, again, bizarrely. Jose Canseco walked with one out in the second inning, before Tino Martinez smashed a line drive to center field, over the head of the Rays' Gerald Williams, probably the hardest Martinez has hit the ball in weeks. Canseco broke well off first base and, although he is not particularly fast, he proceeded toward home. The throw from center field beat him to the base, but Canseco slid to the third base side of the plate and seemed to touch the plate with his foot before the tag was applied. He was called out.</p>
        <p>But the play was not over: Martinez tried advancing to third on the play, and when the throw from catcher Mike DiFelice rolled away from third baseman Aubrey Huff, Martinez rose and broke for home in short, choppy steps -- and was cut down easily when Huff fired home. Two outs and no runs on a double off the wall. Canseco stood at the plate, still waiting to argue the call, as Martinez rose from the dirt. The Yankees were all stunned, and perhaps 30 seconds to a minute passed before any of them wandered on the field for the bottom half of the second inning.</p>
        <p>Clemens walked Fred McGriff to lead off the second and the journeyman Ozzie Timmons pulled a line drive just inside the left-field foul pole for a two-run homer. Clemens stared in disbelief. Later, he would say he felt as if he had been pitching with 25 percent of his game, and merely throwing with the other 75 percent.</p>
        <p>''I truly believed the guys would've scored a bunch of runs tonight,'' Clemens said. ''Every time I threw a ball up there hard and they busted it.''</p>
        <p>It was only the beginning. Randy Winn slapped a run-scoring single in the third inning, and in the fourth, Huff and Mike Smith clubbed back-to-back home runs off Clemens, whose second-half sheen of invincibility has been wiped away in his last two starts. Clemens did not lose a game from June 9 to Sept. 18. But in his last two starts, he has been pounded for 13 runs in nine innings, by the Detroit Tigers and the Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had all been at the rail in front of their dugout during their at-bats in the early innings, but after Clemens was knocked out and the Devil Rays began to run up the score, many retreated to the bench. From there they watched a litany of Tampa Bay rallies, fueled by a wild pitch and a passed ball and an error.</p>
        <p>They could see the developing score of the game between the Red Sox and Chicago and understood its possible implications, and baseball's supermen waited to see if the White Sox would rescue them from their own failures. But next week, they will be left to fend for themselves.</p>
        <p>''For sure, if we get to Tuesday and we win the division,'' Torre said, ''I think there will be a certain amount of freshness. I really don't think this stuff will carry over.''</p>
