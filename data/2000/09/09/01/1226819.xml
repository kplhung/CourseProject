        <p>''Very banged up'' but with no major damage found by doctors, Lance Armstrong, the American who won his second successive Tour de France this summer, was resting at his home in Nice today after he was hit by a car during a training ride.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing broken or serious,'' he reported on his Web site, www.lancearmstrong.com. He was otherwise unavailable for comment.</p>
        <p>''I had a helmet on so we're safe there, but I'm off the bike for two days or so,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dan Osipow, director of operations for Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service team, confirmed that the rider ''was not hurt seriously'' after the head-on crash on Tuesday. It occurred as Armstrong was descending a hill in the countryside near Nice with two American teammates, Tyler Hamilton and Frankie Andreu.</p>
        <p>Hamilton was also knocked down by the car, but, also writing on the Web, said, ''I made it through relatively unscathed.'' He scraped an elbow and knee. ''Frankie didn't crash at all, thankfully,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Hamilton said the three were on a mountain road, descending through some hairpin turns, when ''a speeding car appeared out of nowhere.''</p>
        <p>''The car drove straight into Lance, but luckily his bike took most of the impact,'' he wrote. ''Lance went flying off the bike and tumbled down the road.''</p>
        <p>After Armstrong went to the hospital, the team reported, X-rays to his back and neck proved negative.</p>
        <p>Johan Bruyneel, Armstrong's team director, said: ''There isn't a concussion. It's important that he completely rests for several days.''</p>
        <p>He added that the rider's program for September remains unchanged. Although Armstrong was scheduled to ride in at least one more European race, the Grand Prix des Nations, his major goal for the rest of the year is the time trial championship at the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, this month.</p>
        <p>Armstrong, 28, will also ride in the road race there, but has said he will primarily be assisting another teammate, George Hincapie.</p>
        <p>This was the second notable accident this year for the Tour de France champion. In May, while he was training in the Pyrenees, his bicycle hit a pothole on a descent and he went flying over the handlebars. He was taken to a hospital in Lourdes for tests, which proved negative. After he skipped a scheduled race and rested at home, Armstrong returned to action and two months later won the Tour for the second time.</p>
