      <abstract>
        <p>Credit Suisse reports first half income rose 36 percent, to 3.6 billion Swiss francs ($2.1 billion) (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Swiss financial services group Credit Suisse said income in the first half rose 36 percent, to 3.6 billion Swiss francs, or $2.1 billion, buoyed by securities trading and asset management fees. But shares in Credit Suisse, which agreed this week to acquire Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, tumbled for the second consecutive day, apparently reflecting investor concern over mounting personnel costs, which were driven up 33 percent by soaring bonuses, increasing operating expenses by 28 percent, to 11.7 billion Swiss francs. Income at the company's private banking unit, which invests money for wealthy clients, rose 61 percent, to 1.4 billion Swiss francs. Income from fees and commissions rose 51 percent, to 7.5 billion francs. And income from securities trading rose 49 percent, to 5.4 billion francs. Unlike its bigger Swiss rival, UBS A.G., which reported that its assets under management declined 3 percent in the first half, Credit Suisse said its assets changed little in the second quarter, and rose almost 5 percent in the first three months.</p>
