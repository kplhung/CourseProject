        <p>Responding to fresh signs that the Federal Reserve may be able to avoid further interest rate increases, investors pushed stock prices up briskly yesterday, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index approaching a record.</p>
        <p>The government reported that factory orders declined 7.5 percent in July, the biggest decline on record, and another report showed that industry in the Chicago area contracted in August to the lowest point since 1996. The nation's merchants also reported that sales in August rose only 3 percent, below analysts' expectations.</p>
        <p>The data suggests that six interest rate increases by Fed policy makers since June 1999 may be taking hold and slowing the economy, possibly easing the central bank's concern about inflation.</p>
        <p>Shares of brokerage firms and other financial companies were standouts, continuing to benefit from this week's bid by Credit Suisse for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. J. P. Morgan leaped $16.13, to $167.19, accounting for most of a 112.09-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average that reversed Wednesday's decline. The Dow closed up 1 percent, to 11,215.10. It is now down 2.5 percent for the year.</p>
        <p>But the better general performance was in the Nasdaq composite index, which has made gains in 13 of the last 15 sessions. It soared 102.54 points, or 2.5 percent, to 4,206.35.</p>
        <p>''The market is more pleased about what steady interest rates mean for valuations than worried about what a slower economy will do to earnings,'' said Byron R. Wien, chief United States strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</p>
        <p>The S.&amp; P. 500 advanced 15.09 points, or 1 percent, to 1,517.68, giving it a 3.3 percent gain for the year. Of its components, 306 rose while 167 fell and 27 were unchanged. It is now just 10 points shy of its record.</p>
        <p>''I'm not excited by the performance of the Dow, but I am excited by the S.&amp; P. and Nasdaq creeping up'' out of established trading ranges, said Michael Strauss, managing director of Commonfund, which invests college endowments.</p>
        <p>He said he thought the markets were encouraged by the post-convention bounce in the polls by Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, because it suggested maintenance of the political status quo in Washington assuming Republicans maintain their majority in Congress. ''Divided government is better for financial markets,'' Mr. Strauss said.</p>
        <p>Others, including Andrew Brooks of T. Rowe Price, were reluctant to seek trends in a preholiday summer period. ''It's easy to push stocks around this week because a lot of people are out,'' he said. Some investors were no doubt engaged in month-end transactions, while others remained on the sidelines awaiting today's report on the August labor market.</p>
        <p>Volume did perk up, with 1.07 billion changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 818.4 million on Wednesday. Advancing issues there outnumbered declining ones by 1,727 to 1,156, while 137 stocks made new 52-week highs and 29 slumped to new lows.</p>
        <p>Ford Motor, which has lost about one-fifth of its value over the last three weeks, was among the day's most prominent casualties. The automaker, caught up in a huge tire recall and found by a court in California to have knowingly installed faulty ignitions, dropped as low as $23.81 before closing at $24.25, down $1.75.</p>
        <p>Retail stocks continued to sag, with Target skidding $2.88, to $23.19, after warning of a profit shortfall in the third quarter. J. C. Penney, which said it might trim its forecast, also slumped.</p>
        <p>Clear Channel Communications, down $5.38, to $72, and Ford were the most heavily traded Big Board issues, with 28.5 million shares traded for Ford, the most for the company in a single day in at least 20 years. Dell Computer, the subject of a prominent article in The Wall Street Journal, climbed $3.69, to $43.63, on Nasdaq as 64.2 million of its shares changed hands, the most of any issue.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Rise  By The Associated Press</p>
        <p>Bond prices rose yesterday after reports suggested the economy was slowing, a situation that greatly eases inflation fears.</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 17/32, to 100 8/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.72 percent from 5.79 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year bond rose 30/32, to 108 12/32. Its yield fell to 5.66 percent from 5.73 percent.</p>
        <p>Treasuries were lifted by a Commerce Department report that showed factory orders dropped a record 7.5 percent in July, while orders excluding transportation dipped a smaller 2.6 percent.</p>
        <p>The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said business activity fell to 46.5 in August from 52.0 in July. The figures indicate Chicago-area manufacturing activity is contracting -- something that is probably happening nationwide, analysts said.</p>
