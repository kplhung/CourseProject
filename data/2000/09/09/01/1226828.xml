        <p>To most people at the barbecue fund-raiser here, J. Dennis Hastert, the most powerful Republican in the House, looked like just another middle-aged, gray-haired car buff admiring the antique black Cord parked on the lawn.</p>
        <p>''Who is that?'' one Republican donor asked, nudging a photographer.</p>
        <p>Unlike his predecessor, Newt Gingrich, a legendary fund-raiser for Republicans, Mr. Hastert does not make a grand entrance: He does not travel with a large entourage. His roly-poly face scarcely jogs the memory. He often flies coach, and his ego does not snub a night at the Ramada. ''I'm not very pretentious,'' Mr. Hastert says.</p>
        <p>But Republican leaders say that Mr. Hastert, in his own quiet way, is outdoing even Mr. Gingrich in raising record sums of money for the party and for House candidates through personal appearances. It is a feat few would have expected from a man who, while lauded by his colleagues, lacks star wattage and a  national following.</p>
        <p>Since the last election in 1998, Mr. Hastert has raised $40 million, but this includes only the money he has collected by appearing at fund-raisers. The next two months should increase that total considerably, since the season directly before an election is the busiest for contributors.</p>
        <p>It is a testament both to the power of the position of speaker and his relentless schedule on the road.</p>
        <p>Direct comparisons to the amount of money Mr. Gingrich raised are difficult to make, House Republicans say, mostly because members add up their dollars in different ways. Mr. Gingrich raised a total of $60 million to $75 million for the last election, a sum that takes into account many donations he received through telemarketing and direct mail, Republican leaders say.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia and other Republican leaders are as likely to sign off on mail as Mr. Gingrich was when he was speaker.</p>
        <p>''The key with Denny is he is indefatigable,'' said Mr. Davis, the chairman of the House Republican campaign committee. ''He is not as high-profile as Newt Gingrich, but he has raised more money than Newt Gingrich ever did.''</p>
        <p>''Gingrich, everybody knew who he was,'' he added. ''The faithful would come out to see him in a blizzard. They don't do that for Denny. Newt had that. But Denny overcomes that by working slowly and methodically.''</p>
        <p>In an election year awash in money, critics of the campaign finance system say it should come as no surprise that Mr. Hastert has managed to raise $40 million so far. As anonymous as he is to the public, his job is a powerful one. Had Mr. Gingrich still been speaker, he would almost certainly have outstripped his own fund-raising records, working to maintain the razor-thin Republican margin of seven House seats, analysts say.</p>
        <p>House Democrats, led by Richard A. Gephardt, are breaking their own records, raising more money than ever before. Mr. Gephardt, one of the party's most prolific fund-raisers, has so far raised $41 million, a figure that includes direct mail contributions.</p>
        <p>In total, the House Republican campaign committee has collected $90 million and the Democratic committee has raised $60 million; both Mr. Hastert and Mr. Gephardt raise money for their respective committees, as well as for individual candidates and the party as a whole.</p>
        <p>''It's what's at stake,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. ''If you are the speaker of the House, like any politician, the sense of preservation leads you to do almost anything to retain your job. For Hastert, it's not winning his seat; it's keeping hold of the speaker's chair, which means he has to keep Republicans in control.''</p>
        <p>When he is not in Washington, Mr. Hastert approaches fund-raising with yeomanlike devotion, crisscrossing the country for Republican candidates and the party and doing little else. He has visited 66 districts in 33 states, and so far has attended 104 fund-raisers this year.</p>
        <p>This is Mr. Hastert's third fund-raiser in Los Angeles for Representative James E. Rogan, a California Republican, a pit stop he sandwiched between events in Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Missouri, Arizona and Washington. It raised $45,000 for Mr. Rogan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert's focus on fund-raising on his off time is single-minded, House Republicans and party officials say. Unlike his more famous predecessor, they say, Mr. Hastert, who accepted the job of speaker only after colleagues beseeched him, harbors no presidential, senatorial or gubernatorial ambitions that colleagues know of. He is not writing a book of any sort. He does not lecture at universities.</p>
        <p>''I see this as a task that comes with the job,'' Mr. Hastert said, sitting in an armchair inside the house of Tom and Eva Jeffers, the hosts of the barbecue fund-raiser for Mr. Rogan. ''You just have to do it. Newt was a great speaker and a great political thinker. I've always had success just by going to work and getting things done. Sometimes it's just plodding away to get it done.''</p>
        <p>All the fund-raising, he said, is one reason why he does not make the television news show rounds on Sunday morning.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to do that and to do this at the same time,'' Mr. Hastert said.</p>
        <p>His style is diametrically opposed to Mr. Gingrich's, but that was one of the qualifications for the job during the tumult of 1998, when House Republicans suffered stinging losses in the polls. Mr. Gingrich's persona overshadowed the party, and while at first, this served the party well, by 1998, it was seen as counterproductive.</p>
        <p>There is no flash to Mr. Hastert; he does not advertise his power. He arrives quietly at the Sunday barbecue in a black Suburban, with two aides and two security agents assigned to guard him. A slightly rumpled figure in brown blazer and khaki pants, Mr. Hastert poses for photographs with the host committee members alongside the Jeffers' house, then mingles with the crowd on the lawn, chitchatting unself-consciously.</p>
        <p>On the stump, Mr. Hastert sticks to a meat-and-potatoes speech, stripped clean of lofty phrases. He talks about what House Republicans have done and will do before the election: ''common sense'' tax cuts, as he calls them, a prescription drug benefit, protecting Social Security. He pronounces pundits as ''pundints,'' a hated group among politicians. He is what he is -- a onetime high school wrestling coach.</p>
        <p>''Newt was a great speaker and had a great mind,'' Mr. Hastert said, ''He was off talking about new paradigms all the time and what the 21st century was going to be, and I think what I try to do, is put in place good things for us.''</p>
        <p>All this work on the road has earned him the respect of House members, especially those with safe seats who are under strict orders to raise a total of $15 million for those candidates and incumbents who face competitive races in November. Few members actually enjoy fund-raising.</p>
        <p>''He just focuses on it like a laser beam,'' said Representative Deborah Pryce of Ohio, a Republican leader. And while Mr. Hastert's style may not inspire awe, Ms. Pryce said, he connects with people on a level that does not intimidate. ''He comes across folksy and real because he is,'' she said. ''There are no airs about him.''</p>
