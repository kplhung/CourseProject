        <p>John C. A. Watkins, the longest-serving publisher of The Providence Journal, died Wednesday in Newport Hospital in Rhode Island. He was 87.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins, a decorated World War II fighter pilot, was publisher of The Journal for 25 years, from 1954 to 1979, and retired as chairman of The Providence Journal Company in 1985.</p>
        <p>He led the paper's transformation from a 40,000-circulation daily overshadowed by its afternoon rival, The Evening Bulletin, to a respected regional newspaper whose circulation peaked at more than 218,000.</p>
        <p>He also pushed the company to expand into other areas, acquiring two radio stations and a cable television system. In addition to shepherding the business side of The Providence Journal, he was known for dispatching page proofs to editors with grammatical errors or misused words circled in red, the newspaper said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins was born in Corpus Christi, Tex., on Oct. 12, 1912, and started in journalism in 1934 as a reporter at The Dayton Herald and Journal in Ohio. A year later he moved to The Sun in Baltimore, where his reporting assignments included riding aboard Pan American Airways' Yankee Clipper on the first trans-Atlantic passenger flight in 1939.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins inherited a love of aviation from his father, a military pilot, and he left The Sun in June 1941 and joined the Army Air Force. He served as the operations officer for the 325th Fighter Squadron in the Mediterranean, flying 49 combat missions in P-40 and P-47 fighter planes and surviving at least one crash landing unscathed.</p>
        <p>After three of his five brothers were killed in the war, he was ordered out of combat. His decorations included the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins left the military in 1945 as a lieutenant colonel and joined The Providence Journal as assistant to the publisher. He was named assistant publisher in 1950, then associate publisher in 1953. A year later, at age 41, he was named publisher.</p>
        <p>In 1961, he was named Journal Company president, a post he retained until 1974. He then became chairman and chief executive. In 1983, he left the chief executive job, and stepped down as chairman two years later.</p>
        <p>During his tenure as publisher, The Journal won a Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting in 1974 for a story detailing President Nixon's small tax payments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins married Helen Danforth in 1943 and the couple had four children before divorcing in 1959. In 1960, he married June Watkins, a former actress, who died in 1989.</p>
        <p>Mr. Watkins is survived by two sons, Fanchon M. Burnham of Washington and Stephen D. of San Francisco; a daughter, Jane P. Watkins of Ketchum, Idaho; a stepdaughter, Izetta Smith of Portland, Ore.; and five grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 2, 2000, Saturday  An obituary yesterday about John C. A. Watkins, a former publisher of The Providence Journal, referred incorrectly to a survivor. Fanchon M. Burnham is his daughter, not his son.</p>
