        <p>Ron Howard, the director, and James Horner, the composer, were huddled behind an enormous control panel overlooking the scoring stage where, minutes earlier, Mr. Horner had conducted a full orchestra in a climactic sequence from ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas.''

        <p>Ron Howard, the director, and James Horner, the composer, were huddled behind an enormous control panel overlooking the scoring stage where, minutes earlier, Mr. Horner had conducted a full orchestra in a climactic sequence from ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas.'' As the scene played back on a movie screen on the far wall, the two men listened intently to the way the lush music worked with the dialogue and the on-screen gymnastics of Jim Carrey.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a funny tone in there,'' Mr. Howard said. ''What do you think?'' Mr. Horner listened and nodded. At issue was whether the soaring music was undercutting the comic aspects of Mr. Carrey's performance. It was a tricky question.</p>
        <p>The movie is based on the classic Dr. Seuss children's book about a fuzzy green creature who is so bitter that he conspires to ruin everybody's Christmas in Whoville, the town beneath his mountaintop lair. Mr. Carrey plays the Grinch in full green regalia, including long furry fingers and latex snout, but with yellow contact lenses. In the scene, he bounces around the snow-capped cliff like a pinball, clutching at his heart.</p>
        <p>If the music is too emphatic and emotional, it might drown the comedy. But if the music is toned down too much, the scene might not give the audience the emotional catharsis it wants from the climax. ''It's like being a tightrope walker with one foot in the air at all times,'' Mr. Horner said. ''My feeling is that the funniness is going to come through whatever, so I tend to err on the side of making things emotive.''</p>
        <p>The scoring stage is about the size of a basketball court, strewn with instruments awaiting the afternoon session. A gaily decorated Christmas tree stands in one corner, and brightly wrapped packages are scattered around the room. Mr. Horner's crew members often decorate the stage to match the film on which they are working. For ''The Perfect Storm,'' the same stage had been festooned with ships and plastic frogmen.</p>
        <p>The score, the computer effects and the final sound mix are always the last pieces to be put into place in the weeks before a movie's release. In this case, Mr. Horner and his musicians are working with a little time to spare; ''Grinch'' is not due in theaters until Nov. 17, vying with films like ''102 Dalmatians,'' ''Rugrats in Paris'' and the new Adam Sandler comedy, ''Little Nicky,'' for the lucrative Thanksgiving market.</p>
        <p>During the lunch break, Mr. Horner walked through the crowded scoring stage, picking his way through the tangle of cellos and electronic synthesizers to a line of oddly twisted plastic hoses resting on the floor. Each of the peculiar objects was a musical instrument, created by Mr. Horner's team to make the kind of odd sounds that might come from the Baroque-meets-Dali instruments drawn by Dr. Seuss for his Whoville town band. He picked one up and energetically blew into it, producing a vibrating honk that sounded at once plaintive and hostile. ''We had one that had a slide on it, like a trombone, but it took two people to work it,'' Mr. Horner said.</p>
        <p>One of the most prolific movie composers of the last quarter-century, Mr. Horner has worked on more than 100 film and television scores, though he is perhaps best known for his Oscar-winning work on ''Titanic.'' (He won for best score and best song, ''My Heart Will Go On.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Horner said he usually took about six weeks to write the initial score. ''I do it at a desk with pen and paper,'' he said. ''I don't use a computer in writing at all. I'm sort of old-fashioned about it.''</p>
        <p>In a way, the public aspect of his job -- when he must stand up before a room filled with seasoned musicians, explain what he wants and then conduct them through it -- is the most uncomfortable. ''I tend to be a shy person,'' he said. He does not, for instance, go to the premieres of his films, when he must walk a red-carpet gantlet of television cameras, unless he is forced to attend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Horner wandered into a side office to work on that afternoon's pieces of the score. He is feeling pretty confident about the way things are going on the ''Grinch'' score.</p>
        <p>''When it makes me cry, then I know I've nailed it,'' he said. ''I can't do any better.''</p>
        <p>Joys of Summer</p>
        <p>Michael Tollin was excited. He was preparing to direct the final scene for ''Summer Catch,'' a romance between a poor boy (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and a rich girl (Jessica Biel) set in the world of the Cape Cod summer baseball league, and Ken Griffey Jr., center fielder for the Cincinnati Reds, was going to be playing a key role.</p>
        <p>''It's a pivotal scene,'' Mr. Tollin said. ''We needed a guy who really transcended the sport, who was more recognizable than the average baseball player, and Junior said he was up for it. The scene is a confrontation between him and Freddie's character, and there is some scripted dialogue and some chances for him to do some ad-libbing. I think he's really got the chops.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tollin, a producer for live-action programs on the Nickelodeon network, directed his first film, ''Hank Aaron: Chasing the Dream,'' in 1995. Indeed, he has shown a decided inclination toward the national pastime. In addition to directing ''Summer Catch,'' tentatively scheduled for release next spring, he is producing ''Hardball,'' another movie for release next year that is about a young man in the Chicago projects who becomes a Little League coach.</p>
        <p>''I've always enjoyed working with professional athletes,'' he said. ''Stunt casting -- call it whatever you want. For 'Summer Catch' I got Hank Aaron to come down and do a cameo, Carlton Fisk plays himself, Richie Allen plays a scout and Curt Gowdy is the Cape Cod league announcer.''</p>
        <p>Internet at Sundance</p>
        <p>The Sundance Film Festival, which runs for 10 days every January in Park City, Utah, has decided to institute an Internet component next year. Film festival organizers all over the world have been struggling with how to embrace the work being done on the Web, and Sundance decided this was the way.</p>
        <p>Starting on Jan. 18, the opening day of the next Sundance gathering, the Sundance Online Film Festival -- StreamSearch.com, the company that staged the Internet Film and Music Festival in February, is to produce it -- will present work created specifically for the Web. Festival organizers said they would consider all types of work, including animation, live-action, documentary, interactive and experimental.</p>
        <p>''The dynamic material currently being generated for the Web is something we are excited to present,'' said Geoffrey Gilmore, a co-director of the festival.</p>
