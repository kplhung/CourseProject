        <p>In his fourth year with the Giants, Christian Peter has finally attained the security of a starting job. Just do not tell him that he is under any less pressure.</p>
        <p>After practice today, Peter said that the second he fouls up, ''I'm not going to be the starter.'' The defensive tackle probably has more slack than that.</p>
        <p>Peter inherited the tackle position from Robert Harris, whom the Giants released during the off-season, and Peter responded with a strong preseason that included two sacks.</p>
        <p>Peter has a history in opening games. Last season he recovered a fumble in the season opener and ran 38 yards for a touchdown against the Buccaneers at Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>This season, with little depth at defensive tackle, the Giants are taking a gamble. Keith Hamilton is a fixture. He has started 54 consecutive games for the Giants since 1996. But the team decided to make the rookie Cornelius Griffin strictly a backup defensive end, and that leaves George Williams and Ryan Hale as the backup tackles. They have a combined 12 career tackles in 3 seasons.</p>
        <p>That lack of depth could hamper an attempt by the Giants' defense to return to glory. Long known as the team's strength, the defense has buckled the last two seasons and has raised questions this preseason.</p>
        <p>Peter acknowledged that the defense feels pressure.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' he said. ''We know we can be a dominant defense, but we have to prove ourselves week after week. I think we've proved that we're a solid defense. We've been dominant. We just have to be more consistent.''</p>
        <p>The defense has taken a steady downturn since Coach Jim Fassel's first season in 1997. After finishing third in the league against the run in 1997 by allowing 90.7 yards a game, the Giants have struggled to maintain that high standard the last two seasons. In 1998, the Giants were 23rd against the run (125.3 yards) and last season they were 13th (97.5 yards).</p>
        <p>''There were times last year I thought we played really good defensively,'' said the defensive coordinator, John Fox. ''Like most 7-9 teams in the league, it's not consistently enough.''</p>
        <p>Much of last year's defense featured Peter at tackle because of injuries to Harris. In the 10 games Harris did not play, opponents averaged 108.3 yards rushing.</p>
        <p>Harris missed the final nine games with a broken fibula and a sprained right ankle.</p>
        <p>The Giants finally released him during the off-season, partly because of chronic injuries and also for salary-cap considerations.</p>
        <p>Dixon Expected to Play</p>
        <p>Ron Dixon, a wide receiver-kick returner, spent most of practice today leaning on his right knee, watching his teammates do drills from the sideline. He was dressed in pads but wore red sneakers instead of spikes and walked with a limp as he carried his helmet across the field.</p>
        <p>The Giants still believe that Dixon will be able to play Sunday against Arizona, although he has not practiced since he cut his right heel at the start of practice Wednesday when a teammate stepped on the back of his foot during a special teams drill.</p>
        <p>Dixon, a third-round draft pick, asserted himself during training camp and was arguably the brightest surprise among the rookies.</p>
        <p>With the exception of a game at Jacksonville, in which he dropped two punts, Dixon excelled as a kick returner and won the fourth receivers job.</p>
        <p>He returned a kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown against Baltimore last Friday. On Sunday, he is expected to return kicks and be featured on four-receiver plays.</p>
        <p>''Dixon's going to be fine,'' Jim Fassel said. ''Everything says for the game he's fine.''</p>
        <p>Team Leaders</p>
        <p>The Giants players voted for their captains. Jessie Armstead and Michael Strahan were selected on defense and Kerry Collins and lineman Ron Stone were picked on offense.</p>
        <p>Lomas Brown was selected as the ''special captain,'' a player teammates admire, Jim Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Brown is a 15-year lineman.</p>
