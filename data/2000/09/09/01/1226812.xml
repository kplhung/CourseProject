        <hl1>Return of the White House Turnstile</hl1>

      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on Times articles about David Chang's political donations; says White House must explain who arranged Chang's inappropriate access to Pres Clinton; adds that case raises questions about judgment of Sen Robert Torricelli, who received money, and Clinton fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Well after the 1996 fund-raising scandals brought charges that President Clinton had effectively ''sold'' the Lincoln Bedroom for campaign contributions, big donors continued to gain easy access to the White House in return for their donations. The famous White House turnstile was alive and well at least through last year, when a generous donor named David Chang, who subsequently pleaded guilty to channeling illegal contributions to Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, was granted a number of visits with Mr. Clinton, in both formal and informal settings.</p>
        <p>As outlined in The Times this week by Tim Golden and David Kocieniewski, Mr. Chang and his employees gave more than 100 contributions totaling $325,000 to various candidates of both parties. Although no specific favors from the White House were reported, Mr. Chang was able to meet with National Security Council officials and attend various functions with the president, including two state dinners and a ''movie night.'' He also had pizza with Mr. Clinton at a hotel in Seoul in 1998.</p>

        <p>Well after the 1996 fund-raising scandals brought charges that President Clinton had effectively ''sold'' the Lincoln Bedroom for campaign contributions, big donors continued to gain easy access to the White House in return for their donations. The famous White House turnstile was alive and well at least through last year, when a generous donor named David Chang, who subsequently pleaded guilty to channeling illegal contributions to Senator Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, was granted a number of visits with Mr. Clinton, in both formal and informal settings.</p>
        <p>As outlined in The Times this week by Tim Golden and David Kocieniewski, Mr. Chang and his employees gave more than 100 contributions totaling $325,000 to various candidates of both parties. Although no specific favors from the White House were reported, Mr. Chang was able to meet with National Security Council officials and attend various functions with the president, including two state dinners and a ''movie night.'' He also had pizza with Mr. Clinton at a hotel in Seoul in 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chang appears not to have won support from the administration for his main effort, which was to get repayment of what he said he was owed by North Korea for grain shipments. But Mr. Chang apparently tried to use the perception that he was close to the president and other politicians to secure various business deals. The White House should come forward to explain who arranged for his inappropriate access.</p>
        <p>The case raises questions about the judgment of Senator Torricelli and of Mr. Clinton's chief fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe. The Justice Department is reportedly investigating whether the senator accounted properly for Mr. Chang's donations. Mr. Torricelli's office says he was a victim of Mr. Chang's maneuvers, not a collaborator in them. Mr. McAuliffe says he had no fund-raising ties to Mr. Chang but was simply hired by him in 1998 to help him try to buy a life insurance company in South Korea. Both Mr. Torricelli and Mr. McAuliffe should have been more cautious in their choice of political or business associates. With unregulated campaign donations, everybody gets tainted, and the entire process is diminished as a result.</p>
