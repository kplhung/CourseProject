        <p>The NTT Communications unit of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan has completed its $5.5 billion acquisition of Verio, an Internet service provider based in Englewood, Colo., a week after the White House determined the transaction was not a risk to national security. Concern had emerged that Japan could gain access to delicate government information with the deal. NTT hopes to broaden its corporate Internet services with the purchase of Verio, which operates more World Wide Web sites than any other company. Masanobu Suzuki, president and chief executive of NTT Communications, said the merger ''will position us even more strongly to serve our customers throughout the globe.''</p>
