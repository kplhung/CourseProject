        <p>The Democratic National Committee abandoned plans today to release a commercial that seriously questions Gov. George W. Bush's record in Texas, choosing to yield the spotlight to a new Republican attack advertisement against Vice President Al Gore in the hope that it will backfire.</p>
        <p>And after news reports about the Republican advertisement appeared this morning, Mr. Gore himself immediately revised his plans for the day, backing away from a speech about health care so that the Republicans' message -- an assault on Mr. Gore's credibility -- would come through loud and clear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore then deployed Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, his vice presidential running mate, to denounce the commercial.</p>
        <p>''I'm very sad to tell you that today, rather than focusing on the serious issues before our country, our opponents have hit the airwaves with paid political negative personal attack ads,'' Mr. Lieberman said at a rally in Seattle, with Mr. Gore standing behind him. ''And that's wrong.''</p>
        <p>Democratic officials said they believed that the Republican commercial would backfire as being unfair, and they did all they could to promote that impression. They also said that releasing their own attack against Mr. Bush now would have undermined their own credibility in trying to brand Mr. Bush as too negative, though they acknowledged that they were saving that commercial for later.</p>
        <p>''We'll track it over the weekend and see what happens,'' said one Democrat.</p>
        <p>The Democratic commercial was based on a federal court ruling last month that Texas had failed to abide by the terms of a 1996 consent decree that it improve health care for poor children.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gore followed Mr. Lieberman to the lectern, he delivered his standard stump speech, with only a modest emphasis on the planned topic of the day: a patients' bill of rights.</p>
        <p>In stark contrast to the other health-care speeches he delivered this week, Mr. Gore pointedly chose not to criticize Mr. Bush's record. The point, Gore aides said, was not to distract from news of the Republican commercial.</p>
        <p>The commercial uses pictures of Mr. Gore greeting monks at a much-maligned fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in California and at a separate event taking credit for creating the Internet.</p>
        <p>The Republicans, meanwhile, maintained that the commercial would not backfire and said that their investment of millions of dollars to broadcast it in 17 states was proof that they believed it was valid and would be effective.</p>
        <p>Asked whether the commercial was negative, Bill Pascoe, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said: ''This is not a personal attack. This deals specifically with Gore's credibility on campaign finance, the issue that he says is his No. 1 priority, and that makes a discussion of his credibility fair game.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''What's negative about merely showing video clips of Al Gore saying things?''</p>
