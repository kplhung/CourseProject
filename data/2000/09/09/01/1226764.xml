        <p>In a week of giant DVD releases, it's good to note smaller ones like Dana Ranga's ''East Side Story,'' about Soviet bloc musicals from the 30's through the 60's. ''We have sex; we have all that here,'' says a proponent of the lyrically limited but often wildly colorful shows Stalin loved and indeed rescued when he personally lifted the ban on ''The Jolly Fellows'' in 1934. On Tuesday Kino will release the disc along with a DVD of Carlos Marcovich's ''Who the Hell Is Juliette?'' (1997), a partially fictionalized documentary about a free-wheeling 16-year-old Cuban girl whose gambols, ranging from Havana to New York, have the makings of a musical themselves.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Marcovich's film, Juliette (Yuliet Ortega) befriends a Mexican model several years her senior (Fabiola Quiroz), makes a music video and frolics in front of the camera, childish one minute and seductive the next. And behind what was once the Iron Curtain in ''East Side Story,'' the workers get frisky. ''Rocka docka,'' someone sings. ''We sing the song of the coal press.''</p>

        <p>In a week of giant DVD releases, it's good to note smaller ones like Dana Ranga's ''East Side Story,'' about Soviet bloc musicals from the 30's through the 60's. ''We have sex; we have all that here,'' says a proponent of the lyrically limited but often wildly colorful shows Stalin loved and indeed rescued when he personally lifted the ban on ''The Jolly Fellows'' in 1934. On Tuesday Kino will release the disc along with a DVD of Carlos Marcovich's ''Who the Hell Is Juliette?'' (1997), a partially fictionalized documentary about a free-wheeling 16-year-old Cuban girl whose gambols, ranging from Havana to New York, have the makings of a musical themselves.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Marcovich's film, Juliette (Yuliet Ortega) befriends a Mexican model several years her senior (Fabiola Quiroz), makes a music video and frolics in front of the camera, childish one minute and seductive the next. And behind what was once the Iron Curtain in ''East Side Story,'' the workers get frisky. ''Rocka docka,'' someone sings. ''We sing the song of the coal press.''</p>
        <p>Together these films make a sporty pair out there in some mighty big company. DVD has entered the era of the one-million-disc release, another sign that it is on its way to becoming the format of the future. ''Jaws,'' issued in July, was the first older title to reach one million. This week there are ''Braveheart,'' Mel Gibson's 12th-century Scottish saga, and ''The Sound of Music'' from Fox. Always good for another sell-out edition, come whatever the anniversary or format introduction, George Cukor's film version of the Trapp family musical is so clear on DVD, wrote a reviewer, that one notices the texture of the nuns' wimples when they're praying in the abbey.</p>
        <p>''Braveheart'' has an entertaining documentary about the making of the movie, with Mr. Gibson sprinting from the start of battle scenes he leads as the rebel William Wallace to a position behind the camera, where he takes up the rest of the fray as director. Another thing one learns about making a film near Inverness in the chilly Scottish north is that when it rains one might as well keep shooting because it isn't going to stop anytime soon. It was almost enough to keep Mr. Gibson from taking his shirt off -- almost.</p>
        <p>In the week's third big DVD release, a two-disc edition of Paul Thomas Anderson's ''Magnolia'' from New Line, it is raining frogs in California as the director trots frenetically around various sets in an excellent documentary included on the disc. Slickly packaged in a slip case, ''Magnolia'' probably won't break the million mark, as is certainly the case with ''Men in Black,'' to be issued in three editions next week by Columbia Tri-Star. In its most elaborate version, Barry Sonnenfeld's sci-fi action comedy, starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, includes editing workshops that let viewers chop up a scene to their liking and other extra features from ''character animation studies'' to ''tunnel scene deconstruction'' and for more along those lines, the ''Edgar Bug fight scene deconstructed using angles.''</p>
