        <p>If it's a fine late summer day and you can't get into the U.S. Open, the best thing to do is to give up on the Williams sisters and walk from the National Tennis Center to the Queens Museum of Art, in nearby Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.</p>
        <p>The current show, ''Art at Work,''  commemorates the 40th anniversary of the Chase Manhattan Collection, which since 1960 has displayed more than 17,000 works of art in places where Chase does business. The show fills every corner of the museum, and its rivalry with the glorious views from the upper windows ends in an honorable draw.</p>

        <p>If it's a fine late summer day and you can't get into the U.S. Open, the best thing to do is to give up on the Williams sisters and walk from the National Tennis Center to the Queens Museum of Art, in nearby Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.</p>
        <p>The current show, ''Art at Work,''  commemorates the 40th anniversary of the Chase Manhattan Collection, which since 1960 has displayed more than 17,000 works of art in places where Chase does business. The show fills every corner of the museum, and its rivalry with the glorious views from the upper windows ends in an honorable draw.</p>
        <p>As the annual intake of the collection has averaged nearly 300 works of art -- paintings, sculptures, photographs, mixed-media works, antiquities, ethnic and anthropological adventures -- they could create an effect of confusion. Furthermore, local loyalties had to be considered worldwide, though this was initially a pioneer push on behalf of contemporary art.</p>
        <p>Many familiar figures look well in the Queens Museum. There is Chuck Close's 1980 portrait of Philip Glass, done with stamp ink on paper. There is a monumental table and chair by Scott Burton in white flint and a triptych by Peter Halley, done in 1990, that is believed by some to have been intended to prevent anyone from falling asleep while making a presentation in the conference room in 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza.</p>
        <p>There is a piece by Nam June Paik called ''Video Flag Y'' made up of 84 television sets, three video disc players, eight electric fans and plastic frame video players. And there is a trio of photographs by Richard Prince, dated 1980 and called ''Untitled (Three Women Looking in One Direction),'' that sets up a palpable atmosphere of unease and wariness. There are three felt suits, dated 1970, by Joseph Beuys.</p>
        <p>And there is a photograph called ''Man and Woman Drinking'' (1991) by the French artist Christian Boltanski. It comes with its own electric light and has the effect of a vintage French movie that is taking a break.</p>
        <p>What was necessarily omitted from the show is illustrated in the very handsome commemorative volume called ''Art at Work: 40 Years of the Chase Manhattan Collection.'' Since this retails for $140 it is not likely to find many casual buyers, but it represents the full range of what is by now a multinational, intercontinental collection.</p>
        <p>It also documents a conversation between David Rockefeller, who was president of Chase when the collection was founded in 1959; Robert Rosenblum, who has been on its committee since 1974; and Manuel Gonzalez, who has directed the Chase Art Program since 1988. Given the circumstances none of them could be expected to take a bare-knuckle approach to anything, but something of history blooms in the talk.</p>
        <p>The illustrations offer many surprises. There are, for instance, photographs of Ella Fitzgerald and Joe Louis by Carl van Vechten. There is a photograph of a Chase dining room that was decorated from floor to ceiling in 1982 with yellow and white stripes by the French artist Daniel Buren. (Reactions were mixed.)</p>
        <p>There is an astonishing photograph by Cindy Sherman in which she appears as a heavily bearded and Holbeinesque ecclesiastic. A painting dated 1987 by Ed Ruscha called ''Man, Wife'' also held my attention with its imagery, which shows two big ships under full sail in a heavy wind. The one is forging ahead, the other is way behind. As to which is which, all bets are open.</p>
        <p>There is also a huge list of anonymous art objects from many parts of the world: Afghanistan, Bolivia, Botswana, Burma, the Cameroons and so through the alphabet to Swaziland, Syria, Tahiti, Tibet and West Samoa.</p>
        <p>The quiet, persistent and imaginative spirit behind the collection has been that of Mr. Rockefeller, who at the outset was vice chairman and president of the Chase Bank. It was he who brought back a Coptic painting from Ethiopia and at once gave it to the collection, thereby setting a new note for its future. It was also he who worked with the plaza on Wall Street -- not least in dealing with Jean Dubuffet and his big sculpture, ''Group of Four Trees,'' which is for many people the signature of a certain phase in the life of New York.</p>
        <p>Though himself a long-established  collector, Mr. Rockefeller did not try to dictate the choices for the collection. ''Needless to say,'' he said lately, ''a lot of things were selected that I didn't love, but I kept quiet about it, though I always spoke up for the things that I did love.''</p>
        <p>Within the bank there were intermittent rumbles. In 1992 a lengthy avenue of fluorescent lights and stainless steel by Dan Flavin was installed in the new Chase MetroTech Center in Brooklyn. In no time at all a party of high-ranking dissidents within the bank went out to pick up their chairman and chief executive at the airport and demanded that the Flavin be removed. (It wasn't.)</p>
        <p>In the late 1950's the Chase Bank was in nine different buildings around the city. To Mr. Rockefeller, this seemed ''an inefficient way to run things.'' And, as he said lately, ''one of my many assignments was to find a single location for the bank.''</p>
        <p>In 1957 ground was broken for 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza on a two-acre piece of prime land that Chase had acquired on Wall Street. So it was decided to devote two-thirds of the space to an open plaza that would let in light and air and add a certain exhilaration to the idea of living and working on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>It is now almost universally agreed that outdoor art, well chosen, can add to the quality of life. (Bad outdoor art can make a penance of our daily walks, but that is another matter.) There may not always be enough good art nearby to go round or enough money to buy it. But in that respect, as in others, the Chase Collection has led the pack.</p>
        <p>''Art at Work: 40 Years of the Chase Manhattan Collection'' remains at the Queens Museum of Art, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-5555, through Oct. 1.</p>
