        <p>Reeling from a crisis over defective tires, Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. faces the possibility of a strike tomorrow by 8,000 workers at nine American factories -- a move that could set back the company's efforts to replace 6.5 million recalled tires.</p>
        <p>Officials with the United Steelworkers of America, which represents the Bridgestone workers, said they had scheduled a strike for a minute after midnight, barring a settlement, because of the failure to reach a new contract after months of talks.</p>
        <p>Wayne Ramick, a steelworkers' spokesman, said the union and the company were engaged in intensive nearly round-the-clock talks.</p>
        <p>He declined to predict the likelihood of a settlement before the strike deadline. ''At this point, it's going to be a nail biter,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The strike threat is the latest crisis for Bridgestone/Firestone, and its Japanese parent, the Bridgestone Corporation, which faces Congressional investigations and a raft of lawsuits over tires that federal regulators say might have been involved in 88 deaths and 250 injuries. Two weeks ago, the company recalled more than six million 15-inch tires after Federal officials disclosed complaints that the tread can separate from the rest of the tire, with such failures blamed for dozens of rollover accidents.</p>
        <p>John Lampe, Bridgestone/Firestone's executive vice president, was somewhat upbeat about the progress made in talks and the prospects of avoiding a strike.</p>
        <p>''We think they're going well; we're optimistic we can come to an agreement,'' he said in an interview yesterday morning in Nashville, where the company is based.</p>
        <p>A strike now would hit Bridgestone at an especially vulnerable time in its efforts to restore its badly shaken reputation. It expects to need six months to replace all of the recalled tires, most of them from Ford sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>Some labor experts suggested that the union had threatened a walkout at this point because it believed it might be able now to wrest the most out of Bridgestone.</p>
        <p>Company officials said a strike this week would have a minimal effect on production and on working down the backlog of recall orders.</p>
        <p>Noting that the company was airlifting in tires produced at its factories in Japan, Christine Karbowiak, Bridgestone/Firestone's vice president for public affairs, said, ''We're working very hard to identify and secure tires from as many different sources as possible.''</p>
        <p>Union officials said that they were not trying to pressure Bridgestone at a time of trouble. Rather, they said, workers at the nine plants, who have been working under temporary extensions since their contracts expired, have grown frustrated about not having reached a new agreement after months of talks.</p>
        <p>''It seems that it's high time,'' Mr. Ramick said. ''Negotiations have been going on a long time, and the company has been stalling for a long time in the talks.''</p>
        <p>Union officials said the two sides were focusing on numerous issues, including pensions, wages, seniority rights, grievance and arbitration procedures and the company's policy over absences. Pay for the unionized workers ranges from $9 an hour for new workers to $19 an hour for experienced workers, who receive various production incentives.</p>
        <p>''The company is certainly vulnerable right now,'' said David Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at University of Michigan. ''At the same time, the labor force has an agenda to put forward, and they don't want to be left out of the game.''</p>
        <p>But Professor Cole suggested that it would be unwise for the union to squeeze the company too hard.</p>
        <p>''In the best of conditions, they're going to lose market share,'' he said. ''The real concern is they could end up in a position where they can't support the labor force.''</p>
        <p>The union is threatening strikes at six factories covered by a master contract that expired April 23. They are in Akron, Ohio; Decatur, Ill., Des Moines; Noblesville, Ind.; Oklahoma City, and Russellville, Ark.</p>
        <p>The strike would involve three other factories -- in Bloomington, Ill., LaVergne, Tenn. and Warren County, Tenn. -- covered by separate contracts that have also expired.</p>
        <p>A factory in Wilson, N.C., is not threatened with a walkout because it is not covered by a union contract. The Wilson plant is one of those producing replacement tires for sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>''Our top priority, along with serving customers, is achieving fair and reasonable agreements here,'' said Mr. Sharp, the company spokesman. ''A strike will benefit no one. We're working very hard to avoid any sort of disruption.''</p>
        <p>Many steelworkers are still bitter toward Bridgestone over its extensive use of replacement workers in a 27-month period from 1994 to 1996. During that strike, Bridgestone said it would permanently replace 2,300 of the 4,200 strikers.</p>
        <p>The dispute began with a 10-month strike in July 1994. The union agreed to end the strike in May 1995, but because of the company's use of replacement workers, all the union members were still not taken back to work by November 1996, when a new contract was reached.</p>
        <p>Ford officials said many of the defective tires were made in the Decatur plant when it was using replacement workers.</p>
        <p>''Sure, there's bitterness about that strike, and I've seen T-shirts that say, 'Never forget.' '' said Larry Odum, the steelworkers' regional coordinator for the Southeast. ''Anytime some people are out of work for two and a half years there's going to be some bitterness. But there are also a lot people willing to work with the company and help it through the situation now.''</p>
        <p>The 1994 strike was begun by the United Rubber Workers, but that union, its funds depleted by the strike, merged with the steelworkers' union in 1995.</p>
