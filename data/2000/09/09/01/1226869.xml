        <p>There was the sound of camera shutters madly clicking like a playing card in a bicycle spoke, but the zoom lenses captured no hint of emotion in the dark brown eyes of Andre Agassi.</p>
        <p>There were delicately worded questions about the recent disclosure concerning the diagnosis of breast cancer in his mother last year and in his sister last month, but the inquiries barely caused a rumple in the deep creases of Agassi's forehead.</p>
        <p>He was understandably detached, unmoved and monotone in his responses. Instead of a public catharsis, Agassi chose to keep what he was feeling inside. It was the same way on the stage of Arthur Ashe Stadium. When his opponent, Arnaud Clement, peered through his wraparound shades, he could see an unfocused defending United States Open champion across the net.</p>
        <p>He was not himself. Normally, Agassi's reflexes are quick, his instincts have an edge and the crafty angles of his shots appear choreographed by a pool shark. Normally, when he stands to return serve, he shuffles his feet before pouncing on the ball. Normally, he wouldn't go down like this.</p>
        <p>But this was the un-Agassi yesterday. In the end, Clement, who is ranked 37th in the world, seized upon Agassi's distracted performance on his way to a straight-set upset of the Open's top-seeded player, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. With second-seeded Gustavo Kuerten having been undone on Tuesday, it will mark the first time in the Open Era, which began in 1968, that the top two seeded players will not advance to the third round.</p>
        <p>Agassi was out, and the dream semifinal against Pete Sampras was over. As Agassi exited from the stadium to sympathetic applause, he waved, signed an autograph and briskly departed like a man with more important issues to handle.</p>
        <p>''He is a tennis player fueled by his heart, emotions, beliefs and those he holds dearest to his heart,'' said Gil Reyes, Agassi's friend and trainer for 10 years. ''When all is not well, you can see it in his actions.</p>
        <p>''He is like every human being. We all have issues that we carry deep within. Usually, it stays inside of Andre until he has it sorted out. Right now, I think he's in the process of sorting it out.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, playing didn't seem at all therapeutic for Agassi. Not that anyone could have helped pull him through, but the popular player's support group was thin on size. While the suites were filled, there was a vast ring of empty blue seats at the top of Arthur Ashe Stadium. At the same time, there were lines filled with Anna Kournikova fans forming to get into Louis Armstrong Stadium.</p>
        <p>They had to get their Kournikova fix. Kournikova fed their addictions -- and ended their fears of a second-round exit -- by cutting down her errors to erase a series of early service breaks. The instant she dismissed Sandra Kleinova, 6-4, 6-1, there was a sigh of relief on the grounds.</p>
        <p>Although Serena Williams advanced to the third round in less than an hour last night, the afternoon was inundated with deep exhales by a couple of top women. Fourth-seeded Mary Pierce had to regroup after a series of careless forehands and mishandled volleys caused her to drop the second set against the youngest of the flying Maleeva sisters. But Magdalena, the sibling of Manuela and Katerina, could not sustain her run of five second-set aces, and Pierce went on to close her out, 7-5, 2-6, 6-1.</p>
        <p>Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport also had a scare. For the entire first set, the nimble Kim Clijsters ran down Davenport's heavy ground strokes, transferred that incoming power into blistering passing shots and had her slower opponent on a futile chase around the court. But as Clijsters's drop-shots began to sit up too high, when she couldn't combat Davenport's rise in intensity, she left worn and defeated, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.</p>
        <p>''It's a Grand Slam,'' said Davenport, who fought off a break point in the third game of the second set, then ran off five games in a row. ''I mean, I wasn't ready to walk out yet.''</p>
        <p>Agassi left almost eagerly. Moments after his match, he walked into the interview room, listened to the questions and dispersed short replies. When asked if his heart was in the match, he said flatly, ''Yeah, very much.'' When asked if his recent back injury hampered his movement, he said, ''No.'' After being asked at what point he found out that his mother and sister were ill, he said, ''When it happened.''</p>
        <p>Earlier in the week, and for the first and only time, he did discuss the health of his sister, Tammee, and his mother, Elizabeth, during an interview with the CBS tennis analyst Mary Carillo. At one point, he talked about how difficult it was to maintain his concentration.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, that was evident. An initial hit of adrenaline -- which left him up 2-0 in the first set -- quickly petered out. On break point in the eighth game of the first set, Agassi failed to get his feet in position for a forehand that careened into the net. By the end of the first set, Agassi had lost 14 of 17 points.</p>
        <p>''For sure he can't play a great match today,'' said Clement, whom Agassi credited for his ability to finish off the big points. ''He did a lot of mistakes. Me, I don't think about him. I just think about me.''</p>
        <p>It sounded cold. But few could blame him. Agassi's issues were his own. ''He'll work it out,'' Reyes said. ''He's a strong person.''</p>
        <p>Agassi is a soul-searcher by nature. Through his many incarnations -- from the rock-star blond, to the Zen friend of Barbra Streisand, from an everyman dealing with his failed marriage to Brooke Shields, to a 30-year-old with perspective -- Agassi's career has fluttered up and down according to his personal life. When he's at peace, he's at his best.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, even if his remarks were unrevealing, his play gave a transparent look into his soul.</p>
        <p>''It's not easy to set aside everything and play,'' Reyes said. ''He's going through a lot right now.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>In the men's second-round matches, seventh-seeded THOMAS ENQVIST beat CHRIS WOODRUFF, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2; ninth-seeded LLEYTON HEWITT quickly dispatched the Frenchman JULIEN BOUTTER, 7-6 (6), 6-4, 6-4, and 11th-seeded TIM HENMAN had no trouble with FERNANDO GONZALEZ in a straight-set victory. But sixth-seeded YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV was surprised by the ground strokes and harder serve of ALEXANDER POPP before regrouping to end the threat, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.</p>
