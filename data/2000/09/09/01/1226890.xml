      <abstract>
        <p>Canada's gross domestic product rose at 4.7 percent pace in second quarter; exports rose at 8.5 percent annual rate and imports at 10.2 percent rate; consumer spending rose at 3.6 percent yearly rate; gdp graph (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With a surge in business investment, Canada's economy continued to grow at a strong annual pace, 4.7 percent, in the second quarter, slightly below the 5.1 percent gross domestic product advances of the two previous quarters. Spending on machinery and equipment, mainly computers and related high-tech components, grew by 19.5 percent annually. Exports advanced at an 8.5 percent yearly rate, led also by high-tech sales, and imports were 10.2 percent higher. Considering that much of Canada has endured a cool, wet summer, consumer spending was stronger than expected, rising at a 3.6 percent annual rate.</p>
