        <p>Store windows, each a fantasy world, are ways to seduce the public into entering the shop's inner sanctum and seeking personal fulfillment by buying the fashionable products on view. Unlike the flat world of magazine advertising, the three-dimensional store window, with life-size mannequins and realistic props, has functioned over the years as a small, though frozen, performance space in which passers-by can imagine themselves as players.</p>
        <p>As an inveterate pedestrian along Madison Avenue from 57th to 86th Streets, I have been monitoring and shopping these windows for years. Lately I have been bemoaning the clinical look of stores like Giorgio Armani, at 65th Street, which strip down their displays to a minimalist modernism of dressed torsos, with not so much as a gesturing hand to suggest personality.</p>
        <p>In the past year, though, something even newer has been added, an element altering the illusion of these little theatrical vignettes that glow at night as you proceed up the avenue. Instead of the make-believe sets or an anywhere emptiness, many stores have introduced large-scale background photographs of models wearing garments and accessories, a few of which are actually placed in the window's foreground.</p>
        <p>Just weeks after I first noticed these billboard-style photographs in New York shop windows, a daily walk up the Kings Road during a week in London, followed by a few days of strolling along the Boulevard St.-Germain in Paris, confirmed this innovation as an international phenomenon and a movement to be reckoned with.</p>
        <p>While the new background photographs come in many varieties, the effect is the same. They flatten the space and dampen the imagination. Influenced primarily by the media world of magazine and television advertising, the photographs distance rather than seduce shoppers. The glamour of the models in these larger-than-life images makes the fashions appear unattainable to the average person, who can readily identify with the more human scale of mannequins.</p>
        <p>Gap, in its 86th Street store, took the lead with a summer installation featuring a tableau similar to that of its swing-dance television ads, in which a group of groovy people live it up. Lined up next to the photograph were four stiff, headless mannequins wearing pieces of clothing that matched the outfits on the dancers. But the real outfits looked a bit baggy, more like what Gap customers wear. Understandably, the contrast between the svelte look of the clothes in the photograph and the real garments on the mannequins might discourage the typical shopper, unable to attain such sleek perfection.</p>
        <p>Mercifully, Polo Ralph Lauren, at 72nd Street, and Prada, at 70th Street, held the line earlier this summer with settings that evoked life at  some fashionable southern resort by a turquoise sea. Polo Ralph Lauren's windows must have the shallowest space in town, but still the designers succeeded in scaling down the props to create realistic, comfortable and inviting scenes.</p>
        <p>In its window, on a tiled balcony or terrace overlooking the water, two bronzed female mannequins in sunglasses, wearing sunny yellow and white, leaned companionably against a column, near a ceramic urn and a beach umbrella. Only the reflection of a car in the window brought me back to Madison Avenue.</p>
        <p>When Polo Ralph Lauren succumbed to the photography trend later this summer, the magic was gone. Here, instead of large-scale photographs, the store introduced into each window a seemingly careless assortment of three framed black-and-white photographs of the size to be hung on a living room wall. Each group consisted of a glittering Manhattan skyline in the style made famous by (but not as good as) Berenice Abbott's 1932 ''New York at Night,'' along with two fashion photographs that featured fall clothes similar to those worn by mannequins in the window.</p>
        <p>While the arrangement was meant to suggest fine photography in a New York setting, these and other Madison Avenue photographs lacked even the high quality of the work in fashion magazines.</p>
        <p>In Prada's summer yacht windows, as in its earlier Mercedes-Benz windows featuring pieces of automobiles, the designers placed a section of yacht with a railing and a seat for a headless mannequin dressed for a day of cruising (her hat necessarily on the deck). This installation, against a distant blue horizon, had a jaunty air completely missing in Prada's more recent windows, which included a billboard-style photograph of a model in a chic strapless wool dress for fall, carrying a red handbag. The real handbag was placed on a Lucite shelf next to the photograph like a piece of sculpture, lacking vitality.</p>
        <p>Roberto Chavez, Prada's United States coordinator for window display, says all of the design themes for its store windows are developed at the central office in Milan and then translated all over the world. This latest concept, which Prada considered more modern and realistic, was dubbed simply Advertising Campaign.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, when the photographic message seems right, the store leaves out the fashions altogether. Ann Taylor's windows are tall enough to be actual billboards, and last Mother's Day the store simply exhibited 1940's and 50's photographs of mothers and daughters with the greeting card sentiment ''Remember her.'' And in case you missed it at 60th Street, you could always catch it 20 blocks farther uptown, at the second Ann Taylor on Madison. But generally, Ann Taylor piles a few garments at the bottom of the window. A stack of jerseys and a straw hat on a stand accompanied tall color photographs of models traveling in the desert heat.</p>
        <p>Emanuel Ungaro, at 67th Street, did not even bother with mannequins or stands in its window, which featured a photograph of a model in a tiered chiffon slip dress seated in a  contemporary wire-grid chair. A similar dress in another color, with yellow backless shoes, was simply draped across the bottom of the window.</p>
        <p>In an attempt at abstract photography, Krizia, at 66th Street, superimposed colored circles on a slightly out-of-focus portrait of a man's face.  The circles were to complement the abstract color fields that covered the intimate body parts of a mannequin wearing an otherwise transparent dress.</p>
        <p>Valentino's windows, at 65th Street, represented the other extreme: a busy montage of small color photographs resembling an actual magazine layout. They portrayed a pseudo-sophisticated gathering of friends, who bore little relationship to the ramrod mannequins, which looked decidedly like squares left out of the party.</p>
        <p>DKNY, at 60th Street, goes in for pouty, seductive photographs in its glass-fronted warehouse of a store; similar images are plastered on the interior walls. Only a few mannequins are on view, for most of the garments in the windows hang on clothes racks and are arranged by color with no indication of style or cut. Even Godiva Chocolatier, at 67th Street, has followed suit, with blowups of chocolate to seduce the customer, as if the gold boxes of delectable candies in the window were not enough.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, a few stores on Madison are holding the line, among them  Moschino, near 68th Street. Its surrealistic settings recently included a superabundant Claes Oldenburg-style fruit-and-vegetable stand, with  ties and handbags strewn among the produce. This summer a blossoming tree of roses sheltered a romantic tryst.</p>
        <p>But the new movement reached its apotheosis in the five-story billboard that camouflages the BCBG construction site at 66th Street. It portrays a model in the sensual pose of fingering her blouse, already open to reveal her navel.</p>
        <p>The question is why this innovation of large-scale photography, so lacking in finesse and originality, has moved like wildfire along the avenue. Now a walk up Madison is like flipping through the pages of a fashion magazine. There is something about the three-dimensional human shape of a mannequin, even when it's headless and armless, that makes you dream a bit, even about how to resurrect clothes at home. Advertising photography, on the other hand, is pure calculation, leaving nothing to the imagination. The sad part is now that these photographs have been introduced into shop windows, what once suggested life is lifeless.</p>
