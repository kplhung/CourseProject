        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>''AFRICAN MASTERWORKS FROM THE COLLECTION OF BEATRICE RIESE,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sept. 10). Beatrice Riese, a New York abstract painter who saw her first African sculpture in 1937 in Paris, has collected a wealth of impressive objects, 30 of which are in this show. They include fine bronze Benin plaques and a female ancestor mask from Angola with scars like tears on its cheeks. Especially magnetic is a Songye power figure with a bunched-up body and a sideways-looking face, a compact monument to ferocity. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month). Admission: $4; $2, students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>
        <p>''AMERICAN SPECTRUM: PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURE FROM THE SMITH COLLEGE MUSEUM OF ART,'' National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880 (through Sept. 10). The Smith College Museum of Art cuts a swath of some 250 years in American art, and here and there in this show -- works on loan to the academy while the Smith museum is renovated -- there is something particularly enticing. Among the highlights are Edward Hopper's painting of Helen Hayes's Nyack, N.Y., house, ''Pretty Penny''; Florine Stettheimer's portrait of the art critic Henry McBride; and the ''Mourning Picture'' by Edwin Romanzo Elmer. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $4.50, students and the elderly (John Russell).</p>
        <p>''ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE: 20th ANNUAL EXHIBITION,'' Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, (718) 681-6000 (through Oct. 15). Organized by Lydia Yee and Edwin Ramoran, this is the 20th edition of an annual residency program show for 36 participants. Three dozen artists are about two dozen too many for the allotted basement space (a survey of past Artist in the Marketplace alumni fills the upstairs galleries), and with room for only one or two entries a person, almost everyone gets the benefit of the doubt, critically speaking. Some work always manages to make an impression, and the most promising this year takes the form of a light-touch brand of text-based conceptualism. Hours: Wednesdays, 3 to 9 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $3; $2, students and the elderly; free on Wednesdays (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''CURIOS AND TREASURES,'' Costume Institute, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Jan. 21). Well-selected, expertly installed and beautifully lighted, this exhibition is permeated with the sense of several sets of eyes doing the right thing. Its 65 garments and accessories, some fancy, some very plain, are all from the institute's collection. They travel through four or five centuries of European culture, touching down lightly here and there. Highlights include a suite of dresses and capes by the great Mariano Fortuny, a pielike leather hat from early 17th-century Austria, a formidable farmer's smock from 19th-century England and three rare 17th-century men's doublets. While this assortment may sound a bit piecemeal, the overall effect is close to magical, conveying a vivid sense of how invention, evolution and historical borrowing combine in the life of any art form. The installation makes the act of looking a nearly undiluted pleasure. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>''DANCING DEMONS: CEREMONIAL MASKS OF MONGOLIA,'' Asia Society at Midtown, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street, (212) 288-6400 (through Sept. 17). The religious art of Mongolia is a hybrid of shamanism and Buddhism. It takes a particularly dynamic form in fantastic sculptural masks made to be worn in epic-scale religious dramas that were part morality play, part circus and part public exorcism. Several of those masks -- vividly painted, larger than life -- are in this show. They represent skeletal henchmen of the god of death, clownish holy men and bug-eyed protectors of the Buddhist law who look like demons but were meant to frighten evil away. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''FROM THE STUDIO: ARTISTS IN RESIDENCE 2000,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through Sept. 17). In the past this annual show has given its three artists separate spaces in the gallery; this year the curator, Thelma Golden, mixed them together, amplifying common themes, all of which touch on history. The paintings of Nicole Awai, from Trinidad, take colonialism as their subject in overlaid images of tropical birds, antique prints and illustrations from the British-published schoolbooks she grew up with. Terry Boddie, from Nevis in the eastern Caribbean, in a hushed blend of photography, paint and collage, looks back to Africa and to his family. California-born Sanford Biggers, who is the standout here, brings together art history, 1960's black-power politics, world religion and hip-hop culture with a wry, urban energy. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Fridays, noon to 8 p.m.; admission is $5; $3 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''GOOD BUSINESS IS THE BEST ART: 20 YEARS OF THE ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE PROGRAM,'' Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000 (through Sept. 10). This episodic sampler of a show is a toast to the Bronx Museum's annual 12-week seminar to coach emerging artists in the byzantine process of establishing their careers. Dozens of former participants are represented by work installed in the galleries, accessible in flat files or reproduced in slide format. Glenn Ligon, Whitfield Lovell, Tomie Arai and Fabian Marcaccio are among program veterans from the 1980's. Rina Banerjee, Lane Twitchell, Paul Henry Ramirez and Katharina Bosse bring the roster up to date. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).</p>
        <p>BARBARA KRUGER, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Oct. 22). A lot has changed about the art world in the 20 years or so since Barbara Kruger came on the scene with her snappy photomontages, but a lot has not changed about her work. Her trademark red, white and black text-and-photograph montage is a brand product of the immediate past. Dense and noisy, this retrospective, including audio embellishments, has an intended carnival atmosphere without frivolity. Your reaction will necessarily depend upon a blend of generational sympathy, political concord, aesthetic expectation and tolerance for sarcasm. Ms. Kruger was one of the 80's artists adapting Conceptualism via mass- media forms for political ends, thereby helping to broaden the purview of contemporary art and make the art world more sex-balanced. Young artists reacting against her sort of political stridency now explore subtler, more aesthetically varied routes toward expressions of selfhood. Ms. Kruger, in a sense, helped to pave the way for her own diminished currency, which for a political artist like her may be viewed as a kind of success. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive for the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition that it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ALICE NEEL, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600 (through Sept. 17). The pleasures of this rewarding exhibition are dampened by the feeling that Neel's long, fruitful career could have sustained a larger effort, one that parses her evolution chapter and verse, on paper and canvas, instead of concentrating on the well-known portraits of her last 25 years. These portraits, which usually feature family members or denizens of the art world, are frequently great and always marvelously loquacious. Color, shape and brushwork, along with Neel's signature distortions of body and face, all have their say, and both the painterly process and the human psyche are repeatedly laid bare. Neel, never less than interesting and always striving, operated in the gap between the Stieglitz circle and the Abstract Expressionists with a fruitfulness matched only by Stuart Davis; like his late work, hers is an indelible part of the postwar period. It's time for a full-dress, or in Whitney terms, a two-floor, treatment. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>''1900: ART AT THE CROSSROADS,'' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Sept. 10). A wacky exercise in historical simulation, the excuse being a new century. It is hard to remember the last time so many bad pictures were in one place at one time, unless you consider eBay a place. There is also a good deal of excellent art mixed in among the dogs, and sometimes what is best is not what you would expect, which is partly the show's point. We're meant to look anew at a moment 100 years ago when it was not yet clear who would be the pioneers in the 20th century and who would be forgotten. Thus recapturing innocence, we can make connections that for the sake of simplification or because of ignorance art historians have glossed over. The show provides just enough compensatory rewards for its schlock quotient and whatever might be unclear about its inclusionary standards. But patience is required. The weak-hearted and modern-day cultural Pharisees may never get past the shock of confronting so much of the art that the abstractionists were rebelling against in a museum created as a shrine to 20th-century abstraction. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''PASSAGES,'' Photographs in Africa by Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sept. 24). This exhibition is like a giant walk-in issue of National Geographic: it is entertaining, titillating and, in places, thrilling; but as art and anthropology it is kitsch. Ms. Beckwith, an American, and Ms. Fisher, an Australian, have sought out remote African tribes whose traditions continue to flourish, apparently unaffected by outside influences. Big to mural-scale color photographs and short videotapes show people from all parts of the continent, in traditional finery, dancing, marrying, tending children, conducting funerals and so on. The Africa that emerges is a sanitized paradise of beautiful noble savages. Hours and admission: See above (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>* ''MARTHA ROSLER: POSITIONS IN THE LIFE WORLD,'' New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222 (through Oct. 8), and International Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Oct. 1). This 30-year-career retrospective is also a first major museum show for this seminal Brooklyn-born artist, and even spread over two museums it's of a piece: crowded, agitated, funny and political. Ms. Rosler was involved in the peace movement and feminism in the 1960's and responded with art that combined moral brashness and a television-generation sense of the absurd. Aware of the co-opting power of the market, she chose mediums that were either ephemeral or easily reproduced and distributed. The show mixes all of them together, with video and photography -- her best work -- concentrated uptown and installations (including a cash-and-carry garage sale) at the New Museum. Despite her self-description as a ''ham-fisted'' artist, her work is full of subtleties. It may have little to say to a viewer for whom taste, style and beauty are the exclusive building blocks of art, but as an art of ideas that lead actions, its deeply skeptical utopianism is as vital now as it was in the past. Hours at the New Museum: Wednesdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, noon to 8 p.m. New Museum admission: $6 or $3 for students, artists and the elderly. Hours at the International Center of Photography: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Center admission: $6 or $4 for students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''THE S-FILES/THE SELECTED FILES,'' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272 (through Sept. 24). This museum has a policy of reviewing all slides sent in by artists, and for this group show the curators Deborah Cullen and Yasmin Ramirez selected submissions from the last year for a lively show. It has no overriding theme, and certain political and religious images automatically tagged as Latino are absent or at least played down. The results don't exactly constitute a postidentity gathering, but on the whole the show takes an oblique approach to social issues, exploring them by way of forms and materials. Work by Domingo Nuno's, Juana Valdes, Fernanda Brunet, Alejandro Diaz and the artists who go by the names of Malika, Rabindranat and Vargas-Suarez Universal look particularly good. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $4, $2, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''TREASURES FROM THE ROYAL TOMBS OF UR,'' Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, (212) 685-0610 (through Sept. 10). The Sumerians flourished in third-millennium B.C. Mesopotamia, creating one of the earliest civilizations as they devised essentials like writing, numbers, the wheel and irrigation methods. This sumptuous exhibition attests to their visual achievement with gold, silver and carved calcite vessels; weapons, tools and cylinder seals; and ingenious jewelry made of lapis lazuli, carnelian and gold. On view as well are several of art history's most familiar, if least exhibited, masterpieces. All belong to the University of Pennsylvania and are part of one of archaeology's greatest discoveries: the intact, lavishly equipped royal tombs excavated at Ur in the 1920's by C. Leonard Woolley. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $8; $6, students and the elderly (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>JAMES LEE BYARS, ''The Poetic Conceit and Other Black Works,'' Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through Sept. 16). Relentlessly pursuing perfection, the conceptualist Byars (1932-1997) was a performer and object maker in the tradition of Duchamp. His influences included Zen philosophy and Noh drama, and his work ran to austere shapes of gold, marble, glass and paper. In his legendary performances he did things like enveloping 100 nude volunteers in a single overall garment and arranging in an exactly symmetrical pattern 100 white marbles on the floor of an all-white room. His favorite colors were red, gold, black and white, but this small show is devoted to works in black, including ''The New Moon'' (1993), a poetic wall arrangement of seven black crescents cut from silk paper, each covered by a crescent of glass that gives it a silvery edge. Byars's own presence was very much part of his work, and it's not at all surprising that his fey anima still seems to inhabit it (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>''SIX WOMEN ARTISTS,'' Kate Ganz, 25 East 73rd Street, (212) 535-1977 (through Sept. 15). This show's main attraction is a group of four small works on paper by Eva Hesse, three from the early 1960's made under the influence of Abstract Expressionism and one from 1968 depicting a pair of white circles that is closer to her mature sensibility. Also included are a brushy, four-square abstraction by Grace Knowlton; loopy, linear prints by Dorothea Rockburne; Seurat-like charcoal landscapes by Susan Crowder; more or less abstract drawings by Deborah Hede and Sarah Plimpton; and a pale, multiframed narrative by Emily Brown (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>''LUX ET TENEBRAE,'' Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through Sept. 15). This fine selection from 20 years' worth of Peter Blum's print publishing includes a giant, crisp woodcut by Alex Katz; many surreal autobiographical etchings by Louise Bourgeois; exquisitely refined Constructivist compositions by David Rabinowitch; an allegory of racism in the tropics done in overripe colors by Eric Fischl; sensuous yet cerebral colored woodcut checkerboards by Sherrie Levine; and floating blocks made of squiggly red lines by Yukinori Yanagi (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''SONIC MATTERS, SONIC KOLLABORATIONS,'' Printed Matter, 77 Wooster Street, (212) 925-0325 (through Sept. 9). Young artists are always aspiring to the equivalent of rock star status. The members of the music collective called Sonic Youth are the real thing. In the early 1980's they formed an artists' band that was integral to the downtown club scene in and around the East Village. In addition to producing records, they have turned out poetry, art and promotional graphics, books and self-published magazines. Examples of all these are on view here, and although the material is archival, its anarchic energy still generates heat (Cotter).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>LIZ RIDEAL, Lucas Schoormans, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 243-3159 (through Sept. 8). For the last 15 years this British photographer has made the photo booth, that popular mug-shot dispenser, her primary tool. Works here focus on colored fabrics that the artist manipulates in various ways, producing elegant photographic updates of Color Field painting. In ''Arras Suite Red'' more than 800 little squares depicting slightly crumpled red fabric coalesce into a vibrating field of ordered sensuality (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>''AT THE EDGE: A PORTUGUESE FUTURIST -- AMADEO DE SOUZA CARDOSO,'' AXA Gallery, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street, (212) 554-1704 (through Sept. 16). One of those perfect dropped-from-the-sky retrospectives, this show introduces a talented and ambitious Portuguese modernist who died at 30 in 1918. In the previous 10 years he had absorbed several budding modern art movements in Paris, especially Cubism and Futurism, combined them with references to things Portuguese, and produced vividly colored, carefully calibrated paintings. They seem ahead of their time in their mixing of styles, images, materials and cultural references. His exceptional draftsmanship is shown in a series of ultrarefined drawings that suggest Ingres high on Cubism (Smith).</p>
        <p>LINDA DANIELS AND TAMARA GONZALES, ''A Few of My Favorite Things,'' Cheryl Pelavin, 13 Jay Street, TriBeCa, (212) 925-9424 (through Sept. 9). In very different ways these two artists each deal cheerfully with the sacred. Ms. Daniels makes neat square or diamond-shaped mandala paintings with hypnotic checkerboard and pinwheel motifs. Ms. Gonzales assembles a children's yellow wading pool, strings of Christmas lights, colorful crepe paper decorations and an inflated black smiley-face cartoon character into a funky altar to the Hindu deity Jagannath (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''THE MORRIS MUSEUM: A COLLECTED CENTURY,'' PaineWebber, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212) 713-2885 (through Sept. 8). This miscellaneous sampler from New Jersey's third-largest museum presents selections from all its departments, from paintings to fashion to natural science. The selection includes a bronze statue of Pan by the sculptor Frederick William MacMonnies, beaded Victorian handbags, Navajo rugs, a mechanical Popeye the Sailor toy and a contemporary painting by Wolf Kahn. While almost everything is interesting, nothing in the show is really amazing (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''PASTORAL POP!,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through Dec. 15). Nature-inspired kitsch is the theme of this delirious seven-artist show. It includes Rob de Mar's comical landscape in the form of a spindly tree, Lisa Ruyter's psychedelic update of Seurat's ''Grande Jatte,'' Alyson Shotz's grove of weird plant machines, Peter Gould's transformation of the guard station into a bucolic cartoon, Jason Middlebrook's Styrofoam stonewall planter, Katrin Asbury's miniature diorama in a planter and Rachel Feinstein's suspended Rococo-style pitcher exploding flowers like a pinata (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>''THE CHANGING FACE OF LIBERTY: FEMALE ALLEGORIES OF AMERICA,'' New-York Historical Society, 2 West 77th Street, (212) 873-3400 (through Sunday). Uncle Sam, the allegorical male representative of the United States, has always had a female counterpart, the damsel dressed in flowing robes who came to symbolize Liberty. As a sequel to its ''Uncle Sam'' show, the historical society mounted this very lively display of his iconic sister in her many guises, from ''L'Amerique,'' an Indian princess with feathers in her hair who represented the New World in post-Columbus maps, to the matronly Lady Liberty portrayed in the Bartholdi statue that stands in New York Harbor. The fascinating story of Liberty's evolution is told in posters, cartoons, illustrations and photographs. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students over 12 and the elderly (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* CHARDIN, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). This retrospective doesn't tell us much that wasn't already known about Jean-Simeon Chardin, but there's nothing wrong with being reminded occasionally of what great painting is. The art, by contrast with so much Rococo art, is about love, not sex. Quiet and deliberation were Chardin's essential ingredients, combined with a perfect mastery of abstract form. He was the best still-life painter ever because he made the most of the least, his work focusing on the same humble cups and pans in one painting after another, one decade after another. This results in a compilation of precise little observations that together make as true a record of the value of seeing as exists in the history of art. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>''DRAWINGS BY 20TH-CENTURY AND CONTEMPORARY MASTERS,'' Forum Gallery, 745 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 355-4545 (through today). With work ranging from Picasso and Matisse to contemporaries like William Beckman and Robert Cottingham, this selection of more that 60 drawings is loaded with good work. Some highlights include a finely drawn Cubist cityscape by Lyonel Feininger; a radiantly colorful crayon picture of mill buildings by Oscar Bluemner; a pair of sensuously exploded fantasy girls by Willem de Kooning; and David Levine's caricature of the museum mogul Thomas Krens (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''GLASS WORKS: EMERGING ARTISTS,'' Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Sept. 3). Thirteen Brooklyn artists were invited to produce a glass artwork in response to a piece from the permanent collection. Their creations are distributed throughout the museum, each presented near the work that inspired it. Highlights include Robert Panepinto's heavy blown-glass vase with the image of an Indian deity traced inside; a thick, frosted tortoise shell shield by Himiko Ohta; Beth Lipman's three-dimensional copy of a complicated 19th-century American still-life painting; and Jeff Zimmerman's mirrored, suspended bulbous form, a deliberately contrary response to Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait's sentimental painting of a girl and a fawn. Hours and admission: See above (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RONNIE LANDFIELD/ DAN CHRISTENSEN, Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606 (through today). Both these contemporary painters look as if they belong more to the 1960's than to the present. Mr. Landfield makes big stain paintings with broad swaths of pure color that call to mind the Color Field paintings of Friedel Dzubas. Mr. Christensen, also a stain painter, makes blurry white lines on black fields, creating compositions that read at once as large, impulsive doodles in neon and as diagrams of possibly cosmic significance (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''OPULENT,'' Cheim &amp; Read, 521 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-7727 (through today). ''Opulent'' makes a good case for the visual pleasure principle. It includes Lynda Benglis's lustrous gold intestinal hemisphere; an exotic bronze bell by St. Clair Cemin; paintings of lush profusion by Chris Ofili, Beatriz Milhazes and Richmond Burton; and more orderly stripe or grid-based paintings by Juan Usle and Philip Taaffe. The prize for interesting materials goes to Jeff Perrone's funky stripe paintings made of richly colored sand and buttons (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''PERFECT DOCUMENTS: WALKER EVANS AND AFRICAN ART, 1935,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). At first glance, the photographs of African sculpture taken by Evans (1903-1975) are a far cry from the intensely American depictions of places and people that made his reputation. But actually they are all of a piece, esthetically, with his other work. Symmetrically positioned and tightly cropped, with soft lighting that created no shadows, they preview the compressed compositional style he later used. The 50 vintage images here -- masks, figures, jewelry, utilitarian objects -- are from the more than 450 Evans took to document the show ''African Negro Art'' at the Museum of Modern Art in 1935. The sculptures, of course, are remarkably photogenic; but Evans saw them for the masterpieces they are and conveyed their power with real devotion. Hours and admission: See above (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''RESOLUTIONS: A STITCH IN TIME,'' American Craft Museum, 40 West 53rd Street, (212) 956-3535 (through Sunday). The latest effort by the veteran feminist artist Judy Chicago is a good candidate for worst museum show of the year. A series of posterlike pictures combine familiar verbal slogans and bland, cartoonish illustrations -- as in ''Hitch Your Wagon to a Star,'' which features a family of hopeful African-Americans in an old wooden wagon. Various forms of needlework added by skilled collaborators, all women, embellish the pictures. At the center, a life-size sculpture of a heroic maternal figure made of beige plastic has an embroidered valentine heart and the words, inscribed in many languages, ''Find it in your heart.'' Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursday to 8 p.m. Admission $5; $2.50 for students and the elderly (Johnson)</p>
        <p>''SIX ABSTRACT PAINTERS,'' Karen McCready, 425 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 243-0439 (through today). Emphasis on process is the link in this show. Carleen Sheehan paints lush postcard-size fields of dots, nets and stripes; Margaret Lanzetta layers grid patterns in black, gray and white; Garry Mitchell's loosely gridded pictures are elegantly blurred and richly colored; Beth Miller and Janis Provisor produce drippy, scrawly compositions; and Nicole Parcher mixes gestural drawing and collage (Johnson).</p>
