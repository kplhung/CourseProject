        <p>When the developers of Waterside Estates at Cresthaven in the Whitestone Woods section of Queens began sales two years ago, they deliberately set prices low -- $500,000 and up -- in hopes of building demand.</p>
        <p>Now less than halfway through the planned 110 houses, they say the strategy has worked so well, with help from the generally rising real estate market, that their prices are  running about $100,000 higher than they had originally projected that they would be getting now. The fact that the houses sit near the waterfront did not hurt, either.</p>
        <p>''We knew we opened below market, but that is a common strategy,'' said Philip Megna, a partner in the Mattone Group of College Point who is overseeing the Waterside Estates project. He said that he had assumed the houses would be selling in the mid- to high-$600,000's by now, but that they were selling in the mid-$700,000's. ''There is a lot of demand to live in that area, and we have a very strong economy.''</p>
        <p>Forty-three houses have been built or are under construction and 67 more are planned. By the time all 25 houses in the first phase were under contract in October, they were selling for up to $675,000. Some buyers in that group have already moved in and the remainder are expected to do so in the fall.</p>
        <p>Prices for the second phase (27 houses, of which 19 have been sold) began rising about three months ago, starting at $605,000 and going up to $750,000, depending on which of three models was chosen. There will be 58 houses in the last phase, some of them on larger lots and all of them either on the water or with water views. ''We anticipate that the waterfront housing will sell in the $1 million area,'' Mr. Megna said.</p>
        <p>The development is on 12 acres of prime real estate between the Whitestone and Throgs Neck Bridges, where Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, once operated a children's summer camp. Associated Development Corporation of Bayside is collaborating in the development with the Mattone Group. The architect is John Stacom and the financing is being handled by the CFS Bank, based in Westbury, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The houses are similar, all basically long and narrow, on plots 40 to 45 feet wide by 100 to 120 feet long. The differences are in the details, the slope of a roof, the shape of a window, the style of a kitchen cabinet.</p>
        <p>Buyers have been individualizing  them by choosing everything from the color of the exterior bricks to the shape of the kitchen sink faucets.</p>
        <p>Besides the basic choices, appliances, decorative touches and amenities can be upgraded for additional fees. The first houses were sold strictly on the basis of dollhouse-size models. ''People were spending a half a million dollars on houses they hadn't seen, on land that hadn't been cleared,'' Mr. Megna said.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the proximity to water has been a draw. There will be a private beach for the use of residents.</p>
        <p>''There is very little waterfront property in Queens and certainly very little available for development,'' said Lawrence Rosano, a member of the development team. ''A house in the neighborhood sold for $900,000 last year and the buyer tore it apart and probably put in another $400,000.''</p>
        <p>The taxes are another attraction.  Thanks to the city's 421b tax abatement program, the taxes for the first two years of ownership are based solely on the assessed value of the raw land. ''That means that for the first two years, they would be $400 to $500 a year,'' said Marilyn Larsen, owner of Lane Realty in Great Neck, N.Y., and the director of sales. ''So a $750,000 home here is $500 a year and will be phased in to a full $4,000 a year at the end of eight years.''</p>
        <p>A comparable house in Glen Cove in Nassau County would probably be taxed at more than $18,000, she said.</p>
        <p>None of the houses in Westside Estates are built until they are sold.</p>
        <p>''They are not being put up on spec,'' Mr. Rosano said. ''In Queens, more routinely you build and then sell. Buyers are used to seeing something complete.''</p>
        <p>Once there are contracts and mortgage commitments, the houses go up in clusters. Two of the three models, the Driftwood and the Sandpiper, are high ranches, with the living room, dining room, kitchen and two or three bedrooms upstairs, and a large recreation room downstairs. The center-hall, colonial-style Sandcastle has the more traditional configuration of living room, dining room and kitchen downstairs, and three bedrooms upstairs.</p>
        <p>The developers say that their project marks a departure from the attached houses and town houses that have dominated new construction in the area in recent years. ''We think this may be the largest single-family development in maybe 50 years,'' Mr. Megna said.</p>
        <p>So far, 98 percent of the buyers have been from Queens. ''For most of them, this is their second or third home,'' Mr. Megna said.</p>
        <p>When the former day camp was sold, Catholic Charities kept six and a half acres, where it plans to build three low-rise buildings with 200 apartments for elderly people with moderate incomes.</p>
