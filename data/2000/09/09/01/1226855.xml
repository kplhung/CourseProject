        <p>President Clinton today vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill to repeal the federal estate tax and stepped up the election-year sparring over tax cuts and how best to spend the budget surplus.</p>
        <p>In remarks in the East Room of the White House, Mr. Clinton said the bill ''fails the test of fairness and fiscal responsibility'' because it is costly and, according to administration figures, benefits only the wealthiest 2 percent of the population.</p>
        <p>The president accused Republicans of threatening to hamstring the booming economy by devising a series of tax cuts that he said would leave little money for Medicare, prescription drug benefits, education and a host of other programs.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore has repeatedly lobbed the same charge at his opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who supports repealing the estate tax. And in vetoing the bill today, Mr. Clinton adopted the same sort of language heard from Mr. Gore on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>''I believe that this latest bill, this estate tax bill, is part of a series of actions and commitments that, when you add it all up would take us back to the bad old days of deficits, high interest rates and having no money to invest in our common future,'' Mr. Clinton said, echoing Mr. Gore's attacks on Mr. Bush's tax plans.</p>
        <p>The bill ''shows a sense of priorities that I believe got us in trouble in the first place in the 1980's, and that if we go back to those priorities, will get us in trouble again,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Congress, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois immediately announced that the House would try to override the veto as its first order of business when it returned next week.</p>
        <p>The effort, which requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress, is expected to fail in the Senate and may fall short in the House, as well. Neither Republicans nor Mr. Clinton ruled out the possibility of a compromise today.</p>
        <p>''The death tax punishes families for being successful,'' Mr. Hastert said, using the Republicans' preferred term for the estate tax.</p>
        <p>''It punishes farmers. It punishes small business owners. It punishes those who have not planned ahead with an array of lawyers and accountants to keep their money in their family,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Down the road,'' he added, ''it will punish our young entrepreneurs, who are just starting their own Internet or high-tech ventures.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert has said he will also try to override Mr. Clinton's veto of a bill to give married couples a tax break, one in a series of bite-size tax cut proposals that Republicans have sent to the president in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>The bill to repeal the estate tax had drawn broad Democratic support in Congress, especially in the House, where members recognized its allure to voters. Today, Mr. Clinton was careful not to dismiss the idea of curbing the estate tax and highlighted his party's proposals, which the Democrats say will provide more modest tax breaks for a greater number of people but which Republicans dismiss as having little impact.</p>
        <p>''We are not against wealth and we are not against opportunity,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''If I were against creating millionaires, I have been an abject failure in my years as president.''</p>
        <p>The current tax applies to estates worth more than $675,000, or $1.3 million for a family-owned farm or business, and by 2006 the limit would rise to $1 million. The Republican plan would have phased out the tax entirely over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Only 2 percent of the families of those who die pay the estate tax, but Republicans argue that no one should have to pay the tax, which has a 55 percent top rate.</p>
        <p>According to Congressional and White House estimates, the bill would cost $105 billion in the first 10 years, as the tax is phased out, and then $750 billion in the decade after the tax is repealed.</p>
        <p>Although recent public opinion surveys show that the bill has proven popular among voters, Mr. Clinton's advisers say that is largely because it has been misunderstood. ''Of the $750 billion the repeal costs, one-half -- nearly $400 billion -- goes to the top one-tenth of one percent of estates,'' said Gene Sperling, the president's national economic adviser.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush, who has proposed a $1.3 trillion tax cut over 10 years, has endorsed the Republican estate tax repeal, incorporating it in his own plan. Today, Mindy Tucker, Mr. Bush's press secretary, accused Mr. Gore of ''showing weak leadership'' in ''standing by while his administration vetoed a bill that would help so many hard-working Americans and their families.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's proposal is more in line with the Democratic alternatives. Instead of phasing out the estate tax entirely, it would exempt all estates worth less than $5 million, and the results would be immediate.</p>
        <p>''Most of the benefits under the Republican plan goes to the extremely wealthy,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore campaign spokesman.</p>
        <p>Since the national conventions, both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have jousted over the scale and wisdom of tax cuts at a time when the country is prospering economically.</p>
        <p>The two have used the debate to underscore the two parties' traditional political philosophies, a theme House and Senate lawmakers are also pitching on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>Republicans say the surplus --  money not spent on protecting Social Security -- should be returned to the taxpayer and not spent by the government. Democrats believe it should be steered toward education, health care, Medicare and other programs.</p>
        <p>''You let the surplus sit there in this town and people will spend it,'' Mr. Hastert said at a recent fund-raiser. ''The best thing we can do is take that surplus off the table.''</p>
        <p>Setting aside their campaign rhetoric, though, both sides have inched toward the center, promising to pay down the debt and protect Social Security. While Democrats are devising their own tax cuts, Republicans are talking about spending more money on education.</p>
        <p>Each party is also repackaging its ideas. House Republicans, for example, devised a different approach to tax cuts this year, after Mr. Clinton vetoed their mammoth tax-reduction bill last year. (''A cannonball that was too heavy to fly,'' Mr. Clinton said today.)</p>
        <p>They divided the bill into smaller pieces and portrayed them as common-sense tax breaks for married couples and grieving families who do not want to break up the family farm to pay the tax man.</p>
        <p>The idea of breaking up the bills has proved relatively fruitful, since it drew Democratic votes and appeared to please voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton called the approach clever today, but then excoriated the end result, saying it would still cost too much and do little for low- and middle-income taxpayers.</p>
        <p>''Everybody knows there is a lot more hard work to be done, and there are differences of opinion about what we ought to do and how we ought to do it,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''That's why we're having another election this year. And that's up to the American people to decide.</p>
        <p>''But I believe that prosperity imposes its own difficult choices, because there are so many temptations to do things that seem easy that will have adverse consequences.''</p>
