        <p>In Row 37, at the top of the aisle between Sections 101 and 103 of the Rutgers football stadium, small pieces of broken concrete rested on the steps at the base of a metal handrail. Workers recently drilled and replaced defective grouting there and elsewhere to secure the railings more firmly. The problem was widespread and unexpected in a stadium that was built in 1994.</p>
        <p>While men in hard hats worked beneath a walkway leading to the high seats on Wednesday, Robert Mulcahy, the Rutgers athletic director, said spectator safety would not be compromised when the Scarlet Knights opened their season here Saturday against Villanova.</p>
        <p>''We've had structural engineers and architects in here,'' said Mulcahy, who added that the university was suing the construction company for cost of the repairs. ''I have no concern about the stadium now.''</p>
        <p>There is concern about the football team. After a 1-10 season last year, Coach Terry Shea, beginning his fifth season here, is thought to be under pressure to produce his first winning record or find another job.</p>
        <p>''Once the season starts, I support whatever coach it is and we do the evaluation at the end of the year,'' Mulcahy said. ''My position is clear. We have to improve game by game, practice by practice. Is it fair to say the pressure is on? Yes.''</p>
        <p>The sounds of the laborers' voices and tools carried out to the practice field next door as background to the voice of Shea, who called an angry finish to a sloppy practice. Unless his offense gets focused, Shea shouted to his players, ''we will set an all-time record Saturday night for delay of game.''</p>
        <p>The coach discussed the challenge when he met with reporters on the field after practice.</p>
        <p>''We do not have players who know how to win at the major college level yet,'' Shea said. ''This program hasn't won. It didn't win before I got here. This is our year to get it done.''</p>
        <p>Another omen for the coming season affected Shea personally and professionally. His son, Garrett, a defensive back, had been one of team's best players in 1998 when Rutgers went 5-6 and Shea was voted coach of the year in the Big East. Garrett missed the 1999 season with nerve damage in his shoulder, but was expected to return this fall.</p>
        <p>Doctors told him this summer, however, that his football career is over. It left the coach with another hole in his lineup as well as an ache in his heart.</p>
        <p>''It was very emotional to see your son and one of our key players not have the chance to play a sport that he passionately loves,'' Shea said. ''I only know we need more of those kind of players on this football team.''</p>
        <p>The players have enthusiasm, but there are doubts about the depth, health and quality of the personnel. Quarterback Mike McMahon is back from shoulder surgery after playing only five games last season. He hurt the right side, the one he throws with, when scoring a touchdown. Now, he said: ''It feels good. It feels like it's getting better every day.''</p>
        <p>McMahon is 6 feet 3 inches and 215 pounds, a classic build for the position, and he comes from western Pennsylvania, an area that has produced quarterbacks like Joe Montana, Joe Namath and Dan Marino. McMahon said he had other options but came to Rutgers because Shea was so persuasive and it was a chance to help establish a new Division I-A football power in the East.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if he feels pressure,'' McMahon said of Shea. ''It's kind of been said that if he doesn't get six wins, he's out of here, which I think is a ridiculous statement because it takes time to turn a program around.''</p>
        <p>Another key player, Thomas Petko, will be the nose tackle in the new 3-4 defensive alignment. He came to Rutgers on a wrestling scholarship and was a walk-on for the football team. Petko spoke with confidence and enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>''We have the ability to win games,'' Petko said. ''Coach Shea is on a mission.''</p>
