        <p>SUPPOSE a rich uncle gave you a new car, or regularly sent checks to help with the monthly payments? Two California companies are playing Daddy Warbucks, but their generosity has strings attached: The cars serve as eye-catching mobile billboards for corporate sponsors.</p>
        <p>For example, Susan Jarboe, an account executive with an employment agency, parades around San Francisco in a Volkswagen New Beetle with silver-and-purple bull's-eyes on each side -- a come-on for an Internet portal called MobileEngines.com.</p>
        <p>''I get a lot of stares,'' she said. ''I get stopped at least 20 or 25 times a week.'' Passersby want to know about the ad that covers nearly every square inch of her car.</p>
        <p>For being an auto-exhibitionist, Ms. Jarboe gets $350 a month from FreeCar Media of Los Angeles. ''It seemed like a great way to make my car payment,'' she said.</p>
        <p>FreeCar Media, which started operating in March, and Autowraps, a San Francisco company that is two months older, are leading a charge to wrap private cars with advertising, a trend that is sweeping the West Coast and starting to move east. FreeCar gives selected motorists two years' use of a new car. The owner is responsible for insurance, maintenance, fuel and stares. Autowraps pays participants $100 to $400 a month if they agree to have advertising slathered on cars they already own.</p>
        <p>The chronically shy would not be comfortable in either program, since the point is to grab attention. The cars are wrapped in sheets of adhesive vinyl film that fit like pieces of a puzzle. The film over the windows is perforated, and thus does not restrict the driver's view.</p>
        <p>The process was developed by 3M, the St. Paul-based company responsible for Post-it Notes. The thin film usually comes in four-foot-long sections, with two to four sections forming a large image. The film is designed to withstand wind, snow, rain and speeds of up to 500 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>FreeCar Media says it has given away 30 cars. It plans to have 300 on the streets this year and 2,000 by the end of 2001. The company will not have trouble finding takers; more than 70,000 people have applied for cars by registering at www.freecar.com.</p>
        <p>''People are chosen because of the way they drive and the way they live their life,'' said Lawrence Butler, one of FreeCar's three founders. He says 4,000 people see a car driven in a big city for at least an hour.</p>
        <p>Autowraps has 40,000 prospects registered at www.autowraps.com, and 250 vehicles on the road. Advertisers pay the company $430 to $2,000 a month per vehicle, depending on the size of the wrap and the number of cars sponsored. Daniel Shifrin, president of Autowraps, said the company expected to have 10,000 cars by the end of 2001.</p>
        <p>Advertisers pay FreeCar fees of about $1,250 a month. Citing billboard costs in San Francisco of $70,000 to $90,000 a month, Mr. Shifrin said he could deliver dozens of roving advertisements for the same money.</p>
        <p>Anthony P. Davey, a brand manager at Procter &amp; Gamble, called the wrapping ''an exciting new execution.'' The company has wrapped five Chevy Blazers in conjunction with a new campaign for Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo. ''We wanted to be at teen venues specifically -- concerts, malls, skate parks,'' Mr. Davey said.</p>
        <p>''I get stopped a lot -- at the gas station, going to the gym,'' said Cherie Rose, a senior service agent for Federal Express in Tempe, Ariz. In July, Autowraps covered her red Blazer in blue vinyl -- punctuated by green-and-white checkmarks -- to advertise Lowestpremium.com, a search engine that compares insurance rates. ''Most people are just astonished by it,'' Ms. Rose said.</p>
        <p>New Beetles and sport utilities are particularly popular with advertisers. ''We're directing our clients toward larger vehicles because they're more visible,'' said Chris A. Gaebler, another founder of FreeCar Media. ''S.U.V.'s stand so high above the traffic. But if it was a family-focused campaign, we'd wrap a minivan.''</p>
        <p>There are strict guidelines. Autowraps requires participants to be at least 18, to prove ownership of the vehicle and to verify that they have not had a moving violation within 12 months. A felony or drunken-driving conviction disqualifies a driver forever.</p>
        <p>''We want safe drivers,'' Mr. Shifrin said.</p>
        <p>Both companies require participants to sign contracts pledging to drive a certain distance, usually around 800 miles a month, and to wash their vehicles at least every two weeks. Some contracts require the drivers to park in visible spots.</p>
        <p>The vehicles are also equipped with global positioning units that tell the companies where they are being driven and how fast.</p>
        <p>Although new technology and a plethora of dot-com advertisers are giving the car-wrapping business a high-tech sheen, putting ads on cars is nothing new. VW's bearing cigarette logos used to puff through New York City streets, and of course there are the Oscar Mayer Wienermobiles.</p>
        <p>The latest wave may have begun in 1993 when TDI Inc. of New York, which sells transit ads worldwide, wrapped a San Francisco bus. In conjunction with Supergraphics of Sunnyvale, Calif., it has now wrapped more than 5,000 buses worldwide, including about 100 tour buses in New York.</p>
        <p>So, after developing a process to sell street exposure to sponsors, are the companies' executives driving slogan-emblazoned vehicles all the way to the bank? Mr. Shifrin, for one, says his own car is ad-free.</p>
        <p>''I have a terrible commute pattern,'' he said. ''I work four blocks from where I live, so I walk a lot.''</p>
