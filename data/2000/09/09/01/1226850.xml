        <p>Editorial on German and Swedish bidding for merger with London's venerable stock exchange; says pan-European market cannot be far behind</p>

        <p>They have refused to surrender their beloved pound sterling for a newfangled Continental currency, but the British are about to cede some control over their venerable stock exchange. Swedish and German concerns are vying to be a partner with the London Stock Exchange. It is the latest sign that for all Britain's stiff-upper-lip talk of sovereignty, further economic integration in Europe is inevitable.</p>
        <p>Much like the companies they list, traditional stock exchanges are under a great deal of pressure to expand globally. It makes sense for truly multinational companies to be traded around the clock on truly multinational exchanges with greater liquidity and lower transaction costs. If the old financial centers fail to provide this, new electronic trading systems are eager to fill the gap.</p>
        <p>Faced with this reality, the 200-year-old London Stock Exchange announced in May that it would merge with the Deutsche Borse in Frankfurt. The merged entity, to be called iX for ''international exchange,'' would then create a partnership with the American Nasdaq market as well as the Madrid and Milan exchanges. Earlier in the year the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam stock exchanges announced a union of their own.</p>
        <p>The joining of the Frankfurt and London exchanges was carefully presented as a ''merger of equals,'' so as not to ruffle nationalist feathers. But from the outset, because of the deal's terms, there was much grousing in London financial circles about a German takeover of the exchange.</p>
        <p>Enter the Swedes. OM Gruppen A.B., a company that owns the Stockholm stock exchange and sells trading technology around the world, made a hostile cash-and-stock bid worth $1.12 billion this week for the London Stock Exchange. OM Gruppen, which is also developing a pan-European electronic trading network with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, is representative of Scandinavia's new tech-savvy, entrepreneurial corporate culture. Priced like a tech stock, OM Gruppen has a market value three times that of the London Stock Exchange, even though the Stockholm exchange is about one-seventh as large.</p>
        <p>It is not clear who will prevail in the bidding war. What is clear is that Europe's stock exchanges will continue to consolidate. The European Union has created a single market, and its 11 core ''euro zone'' nations now share a single central bank. A pan-European stock exchange cannot be far behind.</p>
