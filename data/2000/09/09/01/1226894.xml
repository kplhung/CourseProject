        <p>The Pentagon will probably postpone the next test of a national missile defense system until January, administration officials said today. Any decision to deploy the antimissile shield now seems certain to pass out of President Clinton's hands to his successor's.</p>
        <p>Administration officials had previously said Mr. Clinton would decide this summer on deploying a $60 billion antimissile system that would be ready by 2005. To meet that schedule, the Pentagon has been under heavy pressure for two years to conduct enough flights to show Mr. Clinton and his advisers whether the system was technologically feasible.</p>
        <p>But now officials are signaling that Mr. Clinton merely plans to decide whether to go ahead with the program's initial development. The change follows events that include test failures, opposition from Russia as well as European allies and a legal dispute over how far the system could proceed before violating an important arms control treaty.</p>
        <p>To keep that option of initial development open for Mr. Clinton, the Pentagon has requested bids for initial construction of a radar site in Alaska, setting Sept. 7 as the deadline for technical and cost proposals from contractors. The first contracts would have to be awarded by December to permit building to begin next spring and to have a working system in place by 2005. Under the schedule the Pentagon has set in light of conditions in Alaska, it has to start the process soon, subject to later presidential approval.</p>
        <p>The more politically volatile decision of whether to field the system -- and break the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 -- would be left to the next administration, whether that of Al Gore or George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>In a sign of this political evolution, senior military officers, including the program's executive officer, Maj. Gen. Willie Nance of the Army, have argued that there is now no reason to rush more tests. Critics of the program have consistently complained that the military was operating on an artificially fast schedule.</p>
        <p>''General Nance is not going to conduct a test unless he's fully confident that everything is fully ready for the test,'' said Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is awaiting a recommendation from Defense Secretary William S. Cohen on the project, and the issue could come to a head as early as next week. Among the issues that Mr. Cohen is weighing are the costs of building the system, the building schedule and the need for more tests. This month, Mr. Cohen delayed his recommendation, primarily because of a dispute between the Pentagon and the State Department over how far work on the limited missile shield could proceed before the United States would be required to give notice that it was withdrawing from the A.B.M. Treaty.</p>
        <p>Russia has vigorously opposed changing the treaty to allow the United States to field even a limited defense, fearing that it would be prelude to a larger system that would undermine Moscow's long-range nuclear force. Mr. Cohen told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month that administration lawyers had reached a consensus that building the radar station on Shemya Island in the western Aleutians could continue until 2002 before the United States would be in violation.</p>
        <p>Policymakers at the State Department and the National Security Council oppose that interpretation, arguing that it is unilateral and sure to anger the Russians.</p>
        <p>Some diplomats doubt that the decision from Mr. Cohen or the White House would be issued next week, saying the administration would want to avoid a confrontation over missile defense during a United Nations gathering of world leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen suggested this month that the next system test could slip, from October or November to December. But military officials said today that the date would probably fall into January.</p>
        <p>Pentagon experts are still analyzing why a high-speed interceptor that was supposed to have destroyed a dummy warhead on July 7 failed to separate from its booster rocket. Officials have attributed the cause to an error in the rocket's ''databus,'' equipment that transmits electrical signals to the warhead.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Kwajalein Atoll test range in the Marshall Islands is closed for much of December. Associates said General Nance was inclined to give his staff a breather after two years at a breakneck pace.</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials insist that the test program has enough built-in flexibility to absorb the delays. But the Defense Department's top test official, Phil Coyle, warned top Pentagon officials in a report on Aug. 11 that the system could not reach its goal of 2005 because testing was behind schedule and would not include realistic decoy targets for years.</p>
        <p>''A more aggressive testing program will be necessary to achieve an effective capability by 2005 or for even several years thereafter,'' Mr. Coyle said in an analysis first reported this week by Bloomberg News.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Pentagon, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said Mr. Coyle was ''supposed to be an independent voice, but that does not change our goal.''</p>
        <p>''If directed to do so,'' the admiral said, ''we're shooting for 2005.''</p>
        <p>Intelligence officials have warned that the United States could face a threat from some countries, including North Korea, by that date.</p>
        <p>Privately, though, some Pentagon officials are questioning the schedule in the light of test failures and delays in building a new booster rocket for the missile interceptors.</p>
        <p>''We have always admitted that this was a high-risk program, and part of being high risk is the deployment date,'' the chief Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said this month. ''We will try our best, we have been trying our best, and we may meet the deployment date.''</p>
