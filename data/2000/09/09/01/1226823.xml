        <p>Nudged by Germany, and probably providing an example to Italy, France today became the second of Continental Europe's big three economies to propose a large package of tax cuts.</p>
        <p>The proposed cut, totaling roughly $16 billion over three years, is part of a wave of similar measures being enacted across Europe, as governments react to increased tax revenue because of expanding economies and declining unemployment. The cuts, while differing by country, are intended to give a measure of stability to a tenuous spurt of economic growth.</p>
        <p>Economists and government planners hope the lower taxes will help offset climbing interest rates. The French cuts came as the European Central Bank in Frankfurt raised a key interest rate by a quarter point to 4.5 percent, its fifth increase this year, in an effort to cool inflation.</p>
        <p>The tax cuts by the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin come only weeks after Germany's Social Democrat-led government announced even more radical tax changes to reduce annual payments by individuals and corporations by as much as $24 billion by 2005. The French proposals are not only more modest, but also differ substantially from the Germans in how they apportion the cuts.</p>
        <p>In July, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany pushed pro-business measures through Parliament to reduce taxes for corporations and promote their reorganization by sweetening the sale of industrial cross-shareholdings, a built-in obstacle to the kind of industrial consolidation that is now engulfing Europe. Though a Social Democrat, Mr. Schroder has a strong pro-business record. Indeed, the Finance Ministry official responsible for much of the tax change, Heribert Zitzelsberger, is a former senior tax executive of the Bayer chemical group.</p>
        <p>The French measures, by contrast, favor big business less than small and mid-sized companies, households and low-wage earners. The cuts proposed by Economics Minister Laurent Fabius foresee a drop in the top marginal personal income tax rate by 2003 to 52.5 percent, from 54 percent. But the burden for large corporations will probably remain unchanged, since proposed corporate tax cuts will be largely offset by levies imposed to help finance a job-creation plan that reduced the workweek to 35 hours from 40.</p>
        <p>In Italy, the government of Prime Minister Giuliano Amato has said it will propose similar tax cuts in September. Given the leftist component of Mr. Amato's coalition, economists believe that they will more closely resemble those of France than Germany, favoring small businesses -- the backbone of the Italian economy -- and households.</p>
        <p>Still, economists said the French measures should help the whole economy, if indirectly, as tax relief to low-wage earners widens the earnings gap between the lowest-paid employed and the unemployed, raising the incentive for the jobless to seek work. That in turn should relieve the labor market, moderating wage increases. Moreover, fuel tax cuts and lowered social security payments should provide relief to businesses and increase employees' take-home pay.</p>
        <p>Cuts in fuel taxes became a pressing issue in recent days after French fishermen, truckers and taxi drivers blocked ports and roads and refused to work to protest the recent steep climb in diesel fuel prices.</p>
        <p>Experts judged the net effect of the French changes positively. In a note to clients, economists at Credit Suisse First Boston said that while the ''focus seems clearly on households and particularly on low-paid workers, with also a clear impact on small and medium companies,'' large corporations also ''should benefit from the general boost to domestic demand.''</p>
