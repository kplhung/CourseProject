        <p>An emotional and slightly defensive Billie Jean King spoke about her decision to leave the No. 1 doubles player, Lisa Raymond, off the Olympic team in favor of Serena Williams, who has no doubles ranking.</p>
        <p>At a morning news conference regarding the American Olympic teams, King discussed the saga that began when she selected the top four singles players for the American team -- Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles, Venus Williams and Serena Williams -- instead of following the recent Olympic tradition of picking the top doubles player for the fourth position. Raymond challenged the decision but lost in arbitration.</p>
        <p>''I have known Lisa since she was 12 years old,'' said King, who seemed to be on the verge of crying several times. ''I absolutely adore Lisa. This was probably the most difficult call I ever made, definitely.''</p>
        <p>After winning her singles match in the afternoon, Raymond discussed the mentoring role King had played in her life. For Raymond, King's decision was a personal and a professional betrayal.</p>
        <p>The two have not had a conversation since King called Raymond after Wimbledon to tell her she had been left off the team.</p>
        <p>''I'm very frustrated, angry, very disappointed, both in Billie and the U.S.T.A.,'' said Raymond, who breezed through her second-round match against Ruxandra Dragomir, 6-4, 6-2.</p>
        <p>King said: ''It's been very painful. I think I went through a lot of anxiety and pain about it, trying to figure it out.''</p>
        <p>But she defended her selection and insisted that she had fought for Raymond. King said first she lobbied unsuccessfully to have the Women's Tennis Association vote in favor of counting Olympic matches in ranking, which would have allowed the women to take more than four players. Then she approached the International Tennis Federation twice, asking the sport's international governing body to make a special allowance.</p>
        <p>''We made an incredible effort to try to make it happen,'' King said. ''We were unable to.''</p>
