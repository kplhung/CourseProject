        <p>The tables are set with thick, badly painted china, government standard, with silverware of some cheap, scratched metal alloy. A fan of thin, shiny and somehow unabsorbent napkins pokes out of a thick glass; the salt shaker is a jam jar with holes punched in the lid and rice mixed in, to stop clumping. There are other jars, with a few dusty plastic flowers.</p>
        <p>The menu on the wall has more than 50 choices, but only a few dishes, like macaroni with butter or with sour cream, pirogi and a tomato, macaroni and meat soup, have prices listed next to them, meaning that they are available.</p>
        <p>The sour-sweet smell of onions fried in bad oil fills the air.</p>
        <p>And today's Poles, amused and nostalgic, file through this re-creation of a socialist cafe, part of an exhibition called, ''Gray in Color: 1956-1970.''</p>
        <p>That was the heyday of Wladyslaw Gomulka, the Communist Party boss who tried to create a socialism in Poland under Soviet eyes that broke with Stalinism and followed a ''Polish road.'' It was a period of intellectual and artistic energy that ended with enormous disillusion, including a bout of anti-Semitism in 1968 and Polish participation in the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. In December 1970, workers' strikes in Gdansk and Szczecin left 45 dead and 1,100 injured, and Edward Gierek soon replaced Mr. Gomulka, who died in 1982.</p>
        <p>These events underpin this exhibition in Warsaw's Galeria Zacheta, which tries to show the life of the period, particularly its early optimism, without too much overt irony. Photographs show proud mothers and soldiers, a knife grinder plying his trade, a model posing against a lumpy old Czech Skoda car, a couple embracing on the street near a large poster of Lenin.</p>
        <p>''I don't know why it surprises me that people look normal and even happy,'' said Dorota Dobrowolska, a student at the gallery. ''People do the best with what they have.''</p>
        <p>An older woman, Justyna, did not want to give her surname. ''It makes me nostalgic, of course,'' she said. ''We were young, and the war wasn't so long before.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition shows the tension between socialist Poland and European Poland, how the regime tried to keep a connection with the culture of the West.</p>
        <p>There are displays of shop windows with the fashions of the times, with efforts to copy the designers of the West. There are the proud windows of Polish exports: canned Krakus hams and Wodka Wyborowa -- as usual, packaged with a care, neatness and design no one bothered with for the domestic market. Ordinary Poles got by with cheap vodka in reusable bottles with peeling labels, and few at home ever saw a Krakus ham. But there are also photos of the party elite, alike in their dark suits and white shirts, digging in to lavish buffets.</p>
        <p>There is a plastic shopping bag with handles -- what the Russians call an avoska, or ''perhaps bag'' -- that people carried just in case a store had something worth lining up to buy.</p>
        <p>The exhibition recreates one of the ''International Press and Book Clubs'' the regime opened -- 18 of them across the country, 4 in Warsaw -- to allow Poles to read some of the world's press, magazines and books (carefully selected, of course, and concentrating on the products of foreign Communist parties, like L'Unita and L'Humanite). Or they could look at picture magazines or listen to some of the world's music, always a safer proposition.</p>
        <p>There is a sample of the student clubs the regime initiated in the 1950's, ''to channel cultural expression and help propaganda,'' as the gallery's notes suggest. A small black-and-white television drones on with a speech by Mr. Gomulka at a Communist Party Congress. A number of these student clubs were turned into jazz places and theaters, more subversive than the party intended, and some were closed down in 1968.</p>
        <p>There is a re-creation of a small arts cinema, its walls covered with fabric and photographs of stars and directors, including Sophia Loren, Gary Cooper, Jean Gabin, Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock.</p>
        <p>The exhibition concentrates on some of the art of the time, which was graphically bold and somewhat daring, at least in its personal expression. But some of the art feels very dated, which has more to do with the passage of time than ideology.</p>
        <p>Some of the art is devoted to the politically correct program of the time, to ''stop the arms race,'' and promote ''detente and peaceful coexistence,'' as one poster says. Another shows a bomb with an ''N,'' for nuclear; the heading reads: ''N = Nie,'' or no.</p>
        <p>One of the most striking exhibitions shows the initial optimism of the huge tower blocks that the regime built, as in Moscow, to house the workers of the postwar, socialist Poland. There are mock-ups of typical rooms -- the living room with its modular wall of shelves and cabinets for storage and display, the lace curtains and blocky sofas; the utilitarian bathroom, with its plastic plumbing and a long water pipe that could swing between tub and sink, so only one set of pipes needed to be installed; the tiny bedroom, with its wall shelves and record player, a few jazz albums strewn across the floor.</p>
        <p>On the ground floor of the gallery, as a counterpoint to the failed dreams of socialism upstairs, is another exhibition satirizing the modern consumer society of advanced capitalism. It is called ''Buy or Die supermarket'' and is an homage to ''homo shopens'' by the artist Pawel Borowski.</p>
        <p>Products include ''whole lamb stuffed with ideology'' and a ''lollipop flower stuffed with hope,'' its ingredients including ''light in a tunnel, a better future, coloring and confabulation.''</p>
        <p>The market also offers brainwashing powder (''free your mind from dirt -- breakthrough formula is the choice for life!'') and Lady Macbeth soap and shower gel (''it cleans even the most nagging stains'').</p>
        <p>The supermarket's fast-food offering is a ''Happy Meal,'' consisting of ''a name brand bottle of warm vodka, an excellent piece of fat sausage'' and a little vinyl piglet, intended ''to make your life more complete.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the store, the American dollar features as both a lure and a poison, a symbol for greed, globalization and smugness.</p>
        <p>On the same theme, in the luxury department (Last Supper Edition) is a tiny jar marked ''Good caviar.'' The label says: ''Helps everybody! It contains the annual budget of the United States for charitable activities.''</p>
