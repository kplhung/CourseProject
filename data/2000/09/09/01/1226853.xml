        <p>Accusing both the Ford Motor Company and Bridgestone/ Firestone of conspiring to hide tire defects that caused dozens of deaths, Venezuela's consumer protection agency asked the nation's prosecutor yesterday to bring criminal charges against both companies.</p>
        <p>The companies ''had concealed vital information from Venezuelan consumers,'' said Samuel Ruh Rios, chairman of the Venezuelan consumer agency. He said the companies were well aware that ''a macabre combination of a soft suspension and an inadequate tire'' was to blame for at least 80 accidents in which 47 people died.</p>
        <p>The tires involved in Venezuela are similar to those being recalled in the United States in that they are suspected of tearing apart at highway speeds and causing Ford Explorers to roll over.</p>
        <p>In Washington, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration yesterday increased by 26 the number of deaths in the United States that have been linked to the recalled Firestone tires. That brings to 88 the number of deaths being investigated by the agency, along with more than 250 injuries in 1,400 complaints it has received concerning tire separations on the popular Ford sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>In Dearborn, Mich., Jacques A. Nasser, Ford's president, defended the company's actions in Venezuela and denied any attempt to mislead authorities. ''The accusation from the Venezuelan government that Ford Venezuela lied is absolutely unfounded,'' he told reporters during a conference call. He added, however, that Ford would cooperate with any Venezuelan investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasser also promised to testify next week before Congressional committees investigating the tire failures and Explorer accidents. Earlier this week he had said he would not appear, leading to criticism that Ford was not being sufficiently open with the public.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nasser insisted that the problem ''was a tire issue, not a vehicle issue,'' and said that 1.5 million tires had already been replaced, representing 22 percent of the 6.5 million Firestone tires being recalled.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone officials, speaking in a conference call held yesterday at almost the same time as Ford's, said they had not yet had time to translate the report from Venezuela but did not believe that they had done anything wrong.</p>
        <p>''We do not believe there was a conspiracy,'' said Christine Karbowiak, a Firestone vice president. ''We are working closely with Ford, however, to identify the cause or causes of the problems that have been evident.''</p>
        <p>The continuous stream of accusations and bad news hurt both companies on Wall Street. Shares of Ford dropped nearly 7 percent yesterday, or $1.75, to $24.25, a 52-week closing low. Shares of Bridgestone closed down 98 yen in Japan, at 1,380 yen. Early today, the tire maker traded lower still, down 60 yen to 1,320 yen, or $12.37.</p>
        <p>Venezuelan consumer authorities contended that after the first reports there in 1998 of Firestone blowouts causing Ford's Explorers to roll over, the two companies held a series of secret meetings to determine what was wrong. Evidence led them to suspect that the original-equipment Wilderness model tires were failing, investigators said, and instead of starting a costly recall, Ford asked Bridgestone to redesign the tire by adding a new, fifth ply.</p>
        <p>Firestone officials confirmed yesterday that they had discussed redesigns with Ford Venezuela starting in January 1999, but said that such discussions were normal.</p>
        <p>After the meetings, new tires produced at Firestone's plant in the Venezuelan city of Valencia were marked to indicate that they contained five plies, but most contained no more than four, investigators said. Firestone acknowledged that all but a few of the tires had been mistakenly stamped as having five plies, but that they always met Ford's specifications.</p>
        <p>Yet Ford engineers who examined some of the Venezuelan tires made at that time found that their treads separated at a rate 500 times that of Firestone's ATX tires made in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Venezuelan investigators also said that Ford's door-jamb decals recommended lower tire pressures than those set by Firestone. And they said that original-equipment shock absorbers were not strong enough to handle fully loaded Explorers, making them dangerous to operate. Instead of recalling the vehicles and replacing the shock absorbers, the investigators asserted that Ford told dealers to change them without notifying regulators or buyers.</p>
        <p>The Venezulan agency, the Institute for Consumer Protection and Education, does not have the power to file criminal charges, so it recommended that the federal prosecutor do so. It also asked that Bridgestone/ Firestone recall all the defective tires and that Ford replace inadequate shock absorbers on Explorers.</p>
        <p>For lawyers in the United States representing victims of Explorer rollovers and their families, the Venezuelan report may help build a case that the manufacturers withheld information about the tire problem.</p>
        <p>For Venezuela, the action yesterday by the consumer agency, created in 1995, is apparently an attempt to carve out a more influential role in international business matters.</p>
        <p>However, the poorly financed and understaffed agency has never undertaken a case like this before.</p>
        <p>The evidence presented in the report includes examinations of Explorers parked in public lots, as well as American newspaper articles taken from the Internet.</p>
        <p>The consumer agency's chief investigator, Jorge Dominguez, is an agronomist, and the technical expert heading the tire inquiry, Carlos Salanova, is a former Goodyear tire salesman and rally-car driver without engineering qualifications.</p>
