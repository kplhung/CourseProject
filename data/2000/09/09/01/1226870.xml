        <p>The New York Post will reduce its daily newsstand price to 25 cents from 50 cents starting Monday, a move taken two weeks after its main competitor, The Daily News, said it would begin distributing a free afternoon edition.</p>
        <p>The Post, owned by the News Corporation, is reducing its price to attract more readers, said Ken Chandler, the publisher. The reduction will apply every day except Sunday, Mr. Chandler said in an interview yesterday.</p>
        <p>Both The Post and The Daily News have experimented with lower newsstand prices in the past.</p>
        <p>The Post reduced its price to 25 cents on Staten Island for two years in the mid-1990's and its daily circulation in that borough doubled to 12,000, company officials said. The paper lost only 1,000 subscribers when the price went back to 50 cents, the officials added.</p>
        <p>''This is a very aggressive market and we basically see this on the eve of our 200th anniversary as a chance to introduce new readers to the paper,'' Mr. Chandler said.</p>
        <p>The Post, which faces tough competition for advertising dollars from The New York Times and The Daily News, hopes that the lower price and improvements related to a new color printing plant opening in the Bronx next year will help it capture a larger share of the city's newspaper readers.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, The Daily News announced its plan for a free afternoon edition that could cut into The Post's circulation during the September audits, often used to determine the next year's ad rates.</p>
