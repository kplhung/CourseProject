        <p>BLACK is back. Not the color, necessarily, but the name. Yesterday, at the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadows, Lincoln introduced its 2002 Blackwood luxury truck. And Buick has put the final touches on a show car, the Blackhawk, that will make the rounds of custom-car and hot-rod shows.</p>
        <p>The full-size, four-door Lincoln pickup, which closely resembles a design study that was a sensation at auto shows last year, is essentially a Navigator S.U.V. with a pickup bed instead of a wagon-type cargo area. Side-hinged Dutch doors give access to the bed; electric motors open and close the hard tonneau cover. The bed is lined with stainless steel, punctuated by L.E.D. strips that provide illumination.</p>

        <p>BLACK is back. Not the color, necessarily, but the name. Yesterday, at the U.S. Open in Flushing Meadows, Lincoln introduced its 2002 Blackwood luxury truck. And Buick has put the final touches on a show car, the Blackhawk, that will make the rounds of custom-car and hot-rod shows.</p>
        <p>The full-size, four-door Lincoln pickup, which closely resembles a design study that was a sensation at auto shows last year, is essentially a Navigator S.U.V. with a pickup bed instead of a wagon-type cargo area. Side-hinged Dutch doors give access to the bed; electric motors open and close the hard tonneau cover. The bed is lined with stainless steel, punctuated by L.E.D. strips that provide illumination.</p>
        <p>Although the original Blackwood concept truck had rare wenge wood outside its cargo box, the production version will have composite panels that reproduce the look of the dark African wood through a photo-lamination process. The Blackwood's cabin has dark-stained wood trim, adjustable pedals, front and rear consoles and four leather bucket seats that are internally heated and cooled.</p>
        <p>The Blackwood will share the Navigator's 5.4-liter, 300-horsepower V-8 engine.</p>
        <p>The truck goes on sale in the first half of 2001. The price, which has not been announced, is likely to be over $50,000. Fewer than 10,000 are to be built annually.</p>
        <p>The Buick Blackhawk will have a far more limited run -- of just a single car. A four-seat convertible with a retractable top, it is an amalgam of some of Buick's most famous designs: a grille and lighted trunk logo from 1939, a ''torpedo'' body of the 40's, a 455-cubic-inch GS Stage III V-8 engine from 1970 and interior touches from the '96 Riviera.</p>
        <p>''I've worked on a lot of great concepts for Buick, but this is No. 1 for me,'' said Mike Doble, the division's special vehicles manager, who will soon retire after 35 years at General Motors.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Doble came up with the idea of creating a custom car based on highlights of past Buicks, the actual design was done by Steven D. Pasteiner, a former Buick designer who now has his own company, Advanced Automobile Technologies, in Rochester Hills, Mich.</p>
