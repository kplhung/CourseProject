        <p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts has decided to defend a group that advocates legalization of sex between men and boys in a $200 million federal lawsuit brought by the family of a murdered boy.</p>
        <p>''It's not a real popular case,'' John Roberts, the executive director of the Massachusetts A.C.L.U., said yesterday. ''But the First Amendment issues are clear.''</p>
        <p>Last May, the parents of the boy, 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley, sued the North American Man/Boy Love Association in Federal District Court, charging that the group's Web site and literature had incited the killing and attempted sexual assault of their son three years ago in East Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>The child, who was lured into a car by the promise of a new bicycle, was missing for several days before his body was found in a tub of concrete in a river. Two neighbors, Salvatore Sicari and Charles Jaynes, were convicted of kidnapping and murder and are serving life sentences.</p>
        <p>Lawrence Frisoli, the lawyer for the boy's parents, said Mr. Jaynes was a member of the group, known as Nambla, and just before the murder was emboldened by its Web site. ''This lawsuit isn't about money,'' Mr. Frisoli said yesterday. ''Jeffrey's parents are doing this to ensure that it never happens to someone else's child.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roberts and other A.C.L.U. officials said Nambla did not advocate the rape and murder of children. It advocates changing the law to make sex between men and boys legal, and political advocacy, Mr. Roberts said, is protected speech.</p>
        <p>''Regardless of whether people agree with or abhor Nambla's views,'' the A.C.L.U. said in a statement yesterday, ''holding the organization responsible for crimes committed by others who read their material would gravely endanger our important First Amendment freedoms.''</p>
        <p>The A.C.L.U. said, ''We join with all others in deploring the heinous crimes committed against Jeffrey Curley,'' adding, ''those who commit illegal acts can be punished for wrongful conduct.</p>
        <p>''But the expression of even offensive ideas is protected by the Constitution,'' the A.C.L.U. said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frisoli said Nambla's activities passed ''far beyond free speech.''</p>
        <p>''We allege an ongoing criminal conspiracy for the rape of children in America,'' he said. ''They've been hiding behind the First Amendment for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Last week in a Massachusetts state court, in a suit against the two men who were convicted of killing their son, the boy's parents were awarded $328 million, one of the largest wrongful death verdicts in Massachusetts history, Mr. Frisoli said. Now, the family hopes a federal jury will do the same.</p>
        <p>''I respect the A.C.L.U., and on most occasions I agree with the positions they take,'' he said. ''But we're not talking about gay rights. We're not talking about consensual sex between adults. We talking about the rape of children.''</p>
        <p>The A.C.L.U. office in Boston was deluged with phone calls yesterday, mostly from the news media.</p>
        <p>''The threats haven't started yet,'' said Harvey Silverglate, a board member. ''That usually comes a day later. But the phones haven't stopped ringing. I find it extraordinary that people find what we're doing extraordinary. You'd think by now that people would know that we take the Supreme Court seriously when it says that the First Amendment is there to protect unpopular speech.''</p>
