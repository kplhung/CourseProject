        <p>Melissa Painter's ''Wildflowers'' is a dreamy, impressionistic inquiry into the legacy of the 1960's, but it's less concerned with history than with mood.</p>
        <p>Set in 1985, the film circles around the identity crisis of a 17-year-old named Cally (Clea DuVall), who spent her early childhood on a Northern California commune and now lives on a houseboat in Marin County with her father (Tomas Arana). In San Francisco one evening, Cally encounters a mysterious blond woman named Sabine (Daryl Hannah), whom she decides must be her long-lost mother.</p>
        <p>The 60's figure in this movie less as a period in American history -- or even in the history of a specific American subculture -- than as a vague set of ideas, most of which have to do with clothes and interior decoration. Everyone looks as rugged and beautiful as the California coast, where Cally and her friends are shown frolicking as if they lived in a high-end natural-fiber clothing catalog -- something between Whole Earth and J. Crew.</p>
        <p>The muzzy indirection of the narrative, which is often buried altogether in beautiful images and slow, contemplative scenes of Cally wandering through various landscapes, disguises the story's essential thinness. Ms. Painter's attempt to avoid both moralistic disapproval of the 60's counterculture and romantic celebration of it leaves her without much of a context for her characters. Cally's father and his old commune pals talk about the ''craziness'' and ''chaos'' of the time, and there is mention of ''radicals'' and ''the feds,'' but these words seem devoid of reference, even to the mellowed-out relics who utter them. The word Vietnam is never spoken.</p>
        <p>But Ms. DuVall, who attracted some notice as one of Winona Ryder's fellow patients in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' has a knack for understatement that makes her performance believable and affecting. Cally's feelings -- her ardor, her longing, her confusion and her humor -- register in Ms. DuVall's eyes and skin. But her intuitive grasp of emotion makes it all the more unlikely that she could be the daughter of the wildly emoting Daryl Hannah, who conveys Sabine's volatility by lurching inexplicably from bedraggled fatigue to cuddly empathy to keening rage.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Eric Roberts, who, in the real mid-80's, appeared with Ms. Hannah in ''The Pope of Greenwich Village,'' has some good moments as a leathery drug dealer who once loved Sabine. He balances sensitivity and sleaze nicely, though a bedroom scene with Ms. DuVall tips the balance in favor of sleaze. The former poet laureate Robert Hass turns up, reading some of his own poems, as a poet named Robert, another man who loves the wild Sabine but cannot tame her. There's also a live, blithely anachronistic performance by the band Blues Traveler.</p>
        <p>All of these people seem to live and suffer, in a low-key, with-it kind of way, in a vacuum. They inhabit a world in which relationships, politics, literature and art are pretty gossamer decorations, like the skirts and dresses Sabine favors. ''Wildflowers'' is a tapestry of muffled cultural associations that distract the eye and the mind from its pervasive atmosphere of groovy emptiness.</p>
