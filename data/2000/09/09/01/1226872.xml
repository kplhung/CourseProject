        <p>Rick Lazio has collected $10.7 million in seven weeks of summer, for total of $19.2 million since he jumped into New York Senate race against Hillary Clinton in May; he has now raised almost as much as Clinton, who collected $21.9 million over last year, including $3.3 million this summer; Lazio's success implies that donors support any Republican running against Clinton; Lazio now has $10.2 million at hand, Clinton $7.1 million (M)</p>

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio may be less well known than his opponent in the New York Senate contest (not to mention the Republican who dropped out), but in terms of fund-raising, he has already entered her league. Mr. Lazio collected $10.7 million in just seven weeks this summer, his aides said yesterday, leaving little doubt that he will have the means to battle for the seat despite his late start.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has taken in a total of $19.2 million since jumping into the Senate race in May, nearly as much as Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has been raising money for more than a year and has collected $21.9 million. She raised $3.3 million in the seven-week period this summer: July 1 to Aug. 23.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's success with donors suggests that no matter who is on the Republican line -- mayor, congressman, school board member -- the checks will pour in because of hostility among some people across the country to the Democrat, Mrs. Clinton. And Mr. Lazio, a once-obscure congressman from Suffolk County, has readily harnessed that sentiment.</p>
        <p>''I'm Rick Lazio,'' he wrote in an unusually short, one-page fund-raising letter this summer. ''It won't take me six pages to convince you to send me an urgently needed contribution for my United States Senate campaign in New York. It will take only six words: I'm running against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Sincerely, Rick Lazio.''</p>
        <p>Despite her financial edge so far, Mr. Lazio has more money on hand, an important indicator. Mr. Lazio began the race with $3.5 million left over from his House campaigns, and then collected $15.7 million. After expenditures, largely for television advertisements and direct mailings, he has $10.2 million in the bank. She has $7.1 million.</p>
        <p>Both campaigns released summaries of their finances yesterday, but not lists of donors and expenditures. They are required to submit those lists to the Federal Election Commission this month.</p>
        <p>Before exiting the race to focus on his treatment for prostate cancer, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani repeatedly set fund-raising records with a campaign that appealed to the distaste of conservatives and others for Mrs. Clinton. With the same strategy, Mr. Lazio is surpassing even Mr. Giuliani's records.</p>
        <p>In the first three months of this year, for example, Mr. Giuliani took in $7 million, less than Mr. Lazio's total for the recent seven weeks.</p>
        <p>''It is historic,'' said Bill Dal Col, Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, a longtime political consultant who led Steve Forbes's presidential campaigns. ''I have never seen numbers like this.''</p>
        <p>These totals would have been unthinkable in previous races. In the seven-week summer period in the 1998 Senate contest in New York, the eventual winner, Charles E. Schumer, raised $627,000, while the incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, raised $1.7 million, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer spent $16.7 million on the entire race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who raised $23.3 million for his aborted run, and Mrs. Clinton have both surpassed the record for fund-raising by a nonincumbent in a Senate race, the $21 million taken in by Oliver L. North, a Republican, in his failed race in Virginia in 1994.</p>
        <p>The record for spending will not be known until November. Jon S. Corzine, a Wall Street multimillionaire, spent $35.5 million, nearly all of it his own money, to win the Democratic Senate primary in New Jersey. He is expected to spend far more in the general election against the Republican, Representative Robert D. Franks.</p>
        <p>The New York contest is likely to be the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history, and that is without taking into account so-called soft money: large donations raised and spent by party committees. Mrs. Clinton has raised soft money, and while Mr. Lazio has not, outside groups not connected to his campaign have bought ads to help him.</p>
        <p>Because of Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Giuliani took in more money from donors outside the state than a typical Senate candidate, and Mr. Lazio is expected to focus more on such contributors this month. He has scheduled fund-raising visits next week to Alabama, Texas and California. The Lazio campaign said it did not know what percentage of its recent donations were from out of state.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has raised about 60 percent of her individual donations out of state.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides, who long ago resigned themselves to the idea that she is reviled by politically active (and check-writing) conservatives, said they were not daunted by Mr. Lazio's tally. ''We are not surprised that Congressman Lazio outraised us given his ability to tap into a well-funded national network of conservative donors,'' said Cathie Levine, a Clinton campaign spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides attribute some of their success to a sense of urgency among Republicans around the country after Mr. Giuliani dropped out. Many Republican contributors consider the New York Senate race their second priority after the presidential one, because defeating Mrs. Clinton would end the reign of both Clintons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio holds several weekly fund-raisers, often weaving them into his schedule as he travels around the state. Campaigning one Monday in mid-August in the Jamestown area, in the southwest corner of the state, he held a breakfast fund-raiser, then toured a sprawling furniture factory, and then held a luncheon fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has benefited from the groundwork laid by Mr. Giuliani's campaign, especially its direct-mail operation, which compiled a list of more than 200,000 donors nationwide.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, and there is no secret about this, there is a great deal of resentment towards Mrs. Clinton,'' said Bruce J. Teitelbaum, who led the Giuliani campaign. ''No matter who is going to run, they are going to raise big money. That said, Rick Lazio and his team are doing a superb job.''</p>
        <p>For some Democrats, the numbers released yesterday confirmed their fears that Mr. Lazio would quickly catch up to Mrs. Clinton in fund-raising and probably surpass her by November. That does not mean that he will win, but it does make him less of an underdog, they said.</p>
        <p>''They could run a tree against her, and it wouldn't matter,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant not involved in the Senate race. ''The Republicans will do anything to stop her.''</p>
