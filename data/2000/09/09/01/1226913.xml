        <p>Martina Navratilova and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario advanced to the second round in women's doubles yesterday with a dramatic victory over Sabine Appelmans and Linda Wild, 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (3), before an overflow crowd on the Grandstand Court.</p>
        <p>Only organ music was missing as it seemed the spirit had seeped across the boardwalk from Shea Stadium. The spectators became rowdier and and more emphatic after each point, leaping to their feet and four times bursting into rhythmic clapping that strongly implied a ''Let's Go, Marty'' chant.</p>
        <p>After Navratilova and Sanchez-Vicario rallied to win the tie breaker, fans stood whistling and clapping while the winners embraced. Navratilova turned to the crowd, raising her hand, then patted it over her heart. That was close.</p>
        <p>With the crowd so overwhelmingly against them, Appelmans and Wild could only shake their heads and smile. But fan loyalties will be sorely tested in the second round, when Navratilova and Sanchez-Vicario take on the popular 14th-seeded team of Jennifer Capriati and Anna Kournikova.</p>
