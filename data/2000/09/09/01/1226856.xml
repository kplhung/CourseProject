        <p>BROOKLYN: FUGITIVE CAUGHT IN ISRAEL -- A Brooklyn businessman has been arrested in Israel after fleeing the United States to avoid a federal indictment that charged him with trying to defraud a bank of $115 million through illegal accounting practices, prosecutors said. The fugitive, Dov Engel, 52, was the president of Kent International Associates, a distributor of electronic devices and small appliances, when he created false invoices and regularly submitted false financial statements to a lender, La Salle National Bank of Chicago, from 1994 to 1997, prosecutors said.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MAYOR DISMISSES POSSIBLE CANDIDATES -- With the list of possible mayoral hopefuls growing, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that preparations for next year's election were in the ''let's-see-if-we-can-get-publicity season.'' The mayor laughed when asked about Geraldo Rivera, left, the television journalist, who said this week that he may run as an independent, as well as an earlier report that a former police commissioner, William Bratton, may run as a Republican. ''It doesn't sound like I am going to support either of those two,'' he said.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NADER ENDORSES GREEN -- Ralph Nader, the consumer activist and Green Party presidential candidate, yesterday endorsed Mark Green, New York City public advocate, for mayor in next year's election. Answering reporters' questions at a campaign stop in Chinatown, Mr. Nader said, ''I think Mark Green is the best mayoral candidate for New York.'' Mr. Green, for his part, praised Mr. Nader as ''the greatest consumer advocate of the century'' but said he regretted that he could not reciprocate the endorsement. He is backing Al Gore for president.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: GAS PRICES PINCH HEATING FUNDS FOR POOR -- Although more poor families will be eligible for government help with their heating bills this winter, an increase of as much as 20 percent in natural gas prices will mean that federal funds will have to stretch further. Jack Madden, a spokesman for the state office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, which helps poor families with heating bills, said that even during last year's unusually warm winter, the federal government had to add $70 million after $135 million in federal money was quickly exhausted. More people will be eligible for aid this year, with a family of four qualifying if they have an income of about $33,500 a year. Last winter, 626,000 households statewide received aid, a 9 percent increase from the previous year.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>NEWARK: WELFARE BIRTH RULING -- A Superior Court judge has upheld as constitutional New Jersey's 1992 law that denies additional welfare benefits to women who give birth while on welfare. The ruling by Judge Anthony J. Iuliani late Wednesday echoed a 1995 federal court ruling on the law, the first of its kind in the nation. Similar laws have been adopted by 22 other states as part of welfare reform. Opponents, including the National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education fund and the New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, said they would appeal the decision.</p>

        <p>WILDWOOD: DRUG ARRESTS AT NIGHT CLUB -- Ecstasy, Special K, GBL and other so-called club drugs were flowing so freely at the Nile Night Club in Wildwood, prosecutors say, that the state attorney general's office began an investigation there three months ago. Yesterday, the office announced that it had arrested five people between the ages of 18 and 22 on drug distribution charges during a 1:45 a.m. raid, and obtained arrest warrants for nine others.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: CENSUS ACTION FAVORS STATE -- A federal committee has backed off a proposed change in how cities are defined that would have seen New Jersey swallowed up, statistically speaking, by New York City and Philadelphia. The Metropolitan Area Standards Review Committee no longer proposes to lump communities into ''megapolitan'' areas of one million or more people. Under the plan, northern New Jersey would have become part of the New York City area, and southern New Jersey part of the Philadelphia area.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: PEPSI BOTTLER ORDERED TO PAY OVERTIME -- The Pepsi Bottling Group has been ordered to pay more than $270,000 in back wages and interest to 13 delivery drivers who were not paid overtime for working more than 40 hours a week between 1993 and 1998. After a lengthy administrative hearing, the State Department of Labor rejected the company's assertion that the workers were sales people and were therefore exempt from New Jersey's overtime law. Mark Boyd, the state labor commissioner, also ordered Pepsi to turn over wage records for other employees at its four outlets in New Jersey.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: MORE OVERSIGHT FOR APPRAISERS -- Connecticut is stepping up monitoring of real estate appraisers in response to a threat by federal regulators to decertify them. The federal government charged that Connecticut had been lax in answering consumer complaints and monitoring appraiser training. James T. Fleming, the commissioner of the state consumer protection department, which oversees appraisers, said his agency had hired two more workers to handle a backlog of complaints and had made other changes. In January, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council had threatened to decertify Connecticut appraisers. Nearly all home loans require an appraisal from a federally certified appraiser.</p>

        <p>STAMFORD: APPEAL IN CELEBRATED DIVORCE CASE -- Lorna Wendt, the former wife of a millionaire executive who was involved in a celebrated divorce case, insists she is worth at least $35 million. She said she planned to appeal an Appellate Court ruling issued Wednesday that upheld a 1997 divorce settlement ordering her ex-husband, a former General Electric executive, to pay her about $20 million. The ruling allows her former husband, Gary Wendt, to hold on to assets estimated at more than $80 million. Mrs. Wendt argued that her role as corporate spouse and mother for 31 years was key to Mr. Wendt's rise as an executive. Mr. Wendt had offered $11 million.</p>
