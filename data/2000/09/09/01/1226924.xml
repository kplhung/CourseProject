        <p>ALTMAN-David. Floria, beloved friend, and dear Emily and Dara. Separated by an ocean I share your grief and long to shield you from the unremitting pain from which David sought to protect those he loved. We are and will be there for you, as you were here for us. Lovingly, Regina Resnik and Michael Davis</p>
        <p>ALTMAN-David R. It is with great sorrow that we say goodby to the husband of our partner Floria V. Lasky. His visits to our office were always a pleasure. We shall miss him. Fitelson, Lasky, Aslan &amp; Couture</p>
