        <p>It was supposed to be a show of toughness, an antidote to the weakness that has plagued Europe's single currency, the euro, over much of the time since its introduction in January 1999.</p>
        <p>But when the European Central Bank raised interest rates today for the sixth time in less than a year, the euro foundered near its all-time low, amid widespread fear that it will sink even lower. Indeed, more than any other time in the short history of the euro, many financial analysts view the central bank as weak and off balance in response to changes in the region's economic climate.</p>
        <p>''They are behind the curve,'' said Thomas Mayer, a senior economist with Goldman, Sachs in Frankfurt, who argues that the bank is becoming tougher just as European economic growth shows signs of becoming weaker. ''In April 1999, they reduced interest rates even though the economy already seemed to be taking off. We could very well be in a similar situation right now.''</p>
        <p>Alarmed in large part by what it called the ''protracted depreciation'' of the euro, the central bank increased its baseline interest rate by a quarter-point today, to 4.5 percent. In a brief statement, the bank said that the euro's weakness threatened to push up the cost of imported goods at a time when high oil prices -- compounded by the commodity pricing of crude oil in dollars -- were threatening to ripple through Europe's economies.</p>
        <p>But if the move was supposed to build confidence in the euro, it did not. Within minutes after the announcement, the euro slipped slightly, to roughly 89 cents against the dollar. It fell further later in the day, sliding as low as 88.45 before settling at 88.78 cents in New York trading, down from 89.24 cents on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>By any measure, the European Central Bank faces a devilish problem. The euro has lost nearly a quarter of its value against the dollar since its introduction, and the biggest cause of that decline has been the United States' magnetic pull on investment capital.</p>
        <p>If a weak euro should fuel inflation, the currency's credibility and value in world markets can be expected to slip further. But if the central bankers slow economic growth in an effort to prevent inflation, the euro could lose value as investors and corporations tilt more heavily away from Europe and toward the United States. ''European corporations are voting with their pocketbooks,'' said Paul Mortimer-Lee, markets economist with BNP Paribas in London. ''If you raise interest rates too far, there is a danger you will squeeze growth.''</p>
        <p>Though European inflation remains extremely low, at an annual rate of 2.4 percent a year, it has been gathering strength and is now above the central bank's limit of 2 percent.</p>
        <p>Many analysts argue that the bank and its president, Wim Duisenberg, are clamping down on the money supply at a time European economic growth may already be tapering off. Though economists predict that the overall growth of countries in the euro zone will be more than 3 percent this year and next, recent surveys show that business confidence declined in Germany, France and Belgium in the last month.</p>
        <p>The inflationary signals have been ambiguous as well. Stripping out the effects of one-time increases and of crude oil prices -- $33.12 a barrel in New York today -- the underlying rate of inflation is very modest, at 1.3 percent. And though higher oil prices can ripple through the rest of the economy, especially in wage demands, the European Central Bank's most recent assessment is that those effects have not shown up in goods unrelated to energy costs.</p>
        <p>Partly as a result, the move to raise interest rates has so far had the opposite effect on the euro than the central bankers wanted. In the two weeks since they began sending out hints of their intentions, the euro has significantly weakened. Indeed, after staging a modest rebound in June, the currency is now just a smidgen above a record intraday low in European trading of 88.25 cents against the dollar.</p>
        <p>The E.C.B. has trapped itself, Mr. Mortimer-Lee of BNP Paribas said, by setting an inflation target that is too rigid. The Bank of England and the Swedish central bank -- neither country is part of the euro-zone -- have set targets around 2 percent but allowed for flexibility by allowing the rate to vary by one percentage point above or below the target. The European Central Bank, by contrast, has fixed 2 percent as the upper limit and never really set a lower limit.</p>
        <p>To be sure, economists and analysts generally agree that the euro's woes reflect the persistently faster growth of the United States in comparison with Europe. ''There is a massive flow of money into the United States,'' said Ian Gunner, a currency analyst in London with ABN Amro, ''and that has become a major new influence in the past two years.''</p>
        <p>But the United States' investment allure ties back to its higher growth rate.</p>
        <p>''Why do companies want to take over other companies?'' Mr. Gunner asked. ''It has to do with the general well-being of the economy. The euro zone is one year into its recovery, and the E.C.B. is already worried about inflation. That is just not very impressive.''</p>
        <p>Since the euro was introduced, the region has experienced a net investment outflow of about 200 billion euros -- both direct investment in companies and property, and portfolio investments in stocks and bonds. Much of that reflects a sharp increase in trans-Atlantic mergers, most recently the Credit Suisse Group's $12.8 billion deal announced this week to acquire the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</p>
        <p>But a number of analysts complain that the European Central Bank has been inherently slow to recognize changing economic conditions. Such critics think that the bank erred when it reduced its core interest rate to 2.5 percent from 3 percent in April 1999. At the time, central bankers were afraid that lingering effects of the Asian financial crisis and the severe economic problems in Russia would lead to a slowdown in Western Europe. The fears were correct, but late: by the time interest rates were  decreased, Europe was already exhibiting many signs of renewed economic growth.</p>
        <p>The current problems are complicated by the widening divergence of growth rates within the euro zone. Germany, with the largest economy, lagged far behind the pack, growing by less than 2 percent in 1999. But Ireland has grown at well above 5 percent. Consumer prices there are increasing at an annual rate of 6.2 percent, with housing prices surging about 21 percent.</p>
        <p>''With the E.C.B., the president is more of a moderator and consensus builder than a strong leader,'' Mr. Mayer of Goldman, Sachs said. The process of building a consensus is more time-consuming and difficult than at the Federal Reserve, he said, and that may have made the European Central Bank slower in its response.</p>
