        <p>After several years of anemic sales growth at Nordstrom Inc., the chairman and chief executive and the chief financial officer have resigned, the company said yesterday. Two members of the Nordstrom family, which controls roughly one-third of the company's stock, have been named to top executive positions. Blake Nordstrom, 39, will be president, while Bruce Nordstrom, 66, will be chairman of the board.</p>
        <p>In a statement released after the stock market closed yesterday, Enrique Hernandez Jr., a new board member who analysts say is the catalyst for the move, said the board had been disappointed in the company's performance for the last few years. ''We are now at the point where we believe the company would benefit from a different style of leadership,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For some time, there had been rumors of discord between the Nordstrom family, on one hand, and John Whitacre, the departing chairman and chief executive, and Michael A. Stein, the chief financial officer. Mr. Whitacre, who took the helm of the company in 1997, was the first nonfamily chief executive in the company's 100-year history, it said.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Whitacre's tenure did not produce dynamic sales increases at the department store chain, which is based in Seattle, many stock analysts were not happy to see the company return to family management.</p>
        <p>''I am disappointed,'' said Michael Exstein, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''I think Nordstrom had a problem, and John Whitacre and the team he had assembled had started a process to bring the store toward the realities of retail today. They took steps that were utterly necessary, like pooling purchases, reducing costs, not resorting to selling on price.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre and his team were also widely credited by analysts with bringing Nordstrom's notorious inventory overstocking problems under control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Exstein raised concern that the family would not make the hard decisions needed to right the stalled retailer. He pointed to Dillard's, another company where the founding family has a similar stake; it, too, has been struggling in the current difficult retail climate.</p>
        <p>Nordstrom's stock has been in decline for almost a year and a half. Until the announcement last night, it had been trading at about $17.50 a share, almost 50 percent below its 52-week high of $34.50 a share. At the end of July, Nordstrom warned that earnings would fall short of forecasts and the stock plunged. Nordstrom stock closed yesterday at $17.25, down $1.13.</p>
        <p>Dorothy Lakner, a retail analyst with CIBC World Markets, was more equivocal about the management changes. ''It was under Bruce Nordstrom and his generation that Nordstrom saw its greatest years, in the 1980's,'' she said. Still, Ms. Lakner is not recommending the stock. ''Nordstrom is still a company in search of an identity.''</p>
        <p>Nordstrom said it hired a national search firm before settling on Blake Nordstrom to take the role of president. Mr. Nordstrom started working for the company in 1974. He has been a stock clerk, salesman, buyer, merchandise manager and store manager. In 1995, Mr. Nordstrom and his five brothers and cousins were named co-presidents.</p>
        <p>In February 2000, the company eliminated the office of the co-presidency after John Whitacre reorganized the company into five units. He named Blake Nordstrom president of the Nordstrom Rack Group.</p>
