        <p>One day after Bobby Valentine said that he had a good feeling about signing a new contract and returning as manager of the Mets, Fred Wilpon, the co-owner of the team, said that he shared Valentine's feeling. Wilpon added that he also has the same feeling about General Manager Steve Phillips who, like Valentine, does not have a contract beyond this season.</p>
        <p>''I think he's probably correct,'' said Wilpon, about Valentine's comments. ''The vibes that he gets from me, Nelson Doubleday and Steve Phillips are good. We hope we'll be able to enter into contracts with both guys at the end of the year. We want to keep our focus on baseball. Nelson and I are committed to not doing anything until the end of the season.''</p>

        <p>One day after Bobby Valentine said that he had a good feeling about signing a new contract and returning as manager of the Mets, Fred Wilpon, the co-owner of the team, said that he shared Valentine's feeling. Wilpon added that he also has the same feeling about General Manager Steve Phillips who, like Valentine, does not have a contract beyond this season.</p>
        <p>''I think he's probably correct,'' said Wilpon, about Valentine's comments. ''The vibes that he gets from me, Nelson Doubleday and Steve Phillips are good. We hope we'll be able to enter into contracts with both guys at the end of the year. We want to keep our focus on baseball. Nelson and I are committed to not doing anything until the end of the season.''</p>
        <p>Wilpon said that commitment would hold even if the Mets qualify for the postseason. And Wilpon declined to say whether he thought that the Mets' tough stance on Valentine's contract had influenced the manager's behavior. Like Valentine, Wilpon felt positive.</p>
        <p>''I have a good feeling, too,'' Wilpon said. ''I had it at the beginning of the year and I have it right now.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, in a roster development, the Mets have acquired the infielder Jorge Velandia from the Oakland Athletics in exchange for the minor league outfielder Nelson Cruz. Velandia, 25, hit .125 for the Athletics in 18 games this season and .283 for Class AAA Sacramento, and Phillips said that he would likely be called up to the Mets when the season ends at Class AAA Norfolk.</p>
        <p>In another move, the Mets have outrighted the right-handed reliever Jim Mann to Norfolk.</p>
