        <p>For the third night in a row, more than 800 residents of this small factory town on the Hudson River were unable to go home today, evacuated because a tanker train car in a nearby rail yard was leaking ammonia gas.</p>
        <p>The rail car, bound for a paper mill, began leaking anhydrous ammonia vapor through a faulty gasket Tuesday night.

        <p>For the third night in a row, more than 800 residents of this small factory town on the Hudson River were unable to go home today, evacuated because a tanker train car in a nearby rail yard was leaking ammonia gas.</p>
        <p>The rail car, bound for a paper mill, began leaking anhydrous ammonia vapor through a faulty gasket Tuesday night. Though emergency crews have transferred most of the gas to another car, the evacuees -- more than a quarter of Fort Edward's 3,000 residents -- were told today that it was still not safe to return, Firefighter Mark Brockaway said.</p>
        <p>And the downtown of Fort Edward, about 43 miles north of Albany, remained off limits to the public except for through traffic.</p>
        <p>''Basically, I'm trying to get my family back in the house,'' said Arvid O'Connell, who was also rousted from his home in a low-lying part of town, where the gas accumulated. He was staying with in-laws in a neighborhood on higher ground.</p>
        <p>''We were more or less at the mercy of the wind,'' said Mr. O'Connell, standing near Fort Edward High School, command center for dozens of police officers, firefighters and other emergency workers, reporters, and local, state and federal  officials. ''First they moved us to the firehouse and then up here.''</p>
        <p>At 11:06 p.m. Tuesday, two men saw and smelled the ammonia leaking from the top of a tanker car just east of downtown, said Max Fruchter, a spokesman for the Fort Edward Fire Department. The leak was in a gasket in a bell-shaped compartment that serves as an emergency valve, akin to that on a pressure cooker.</p>
        <p>Firefighters arrived five minutes later, followed by Washington County emergency workers, 9 other fire companies, 17 ambulances and more than 100 volunteers to help evacuate people.</p>
        <p>About 60 people were treated at hospitals, mostly children whose asthma was worsened by stress or older people with medical conditions. Mr. Fruchter said one elderly person was injured by inhaling the ammonia vapor and was likely to be released soon.</p>
        <p>A section of the Champlain Barge Canal was still closed today, and Amtrak trains to Montreal, which run through here, were being stopped in Albany, where passengers switched to buses.</p>
        <p>Most evacuees moved in with relatives and friends, and 150 stayed at the high school overnight before finding other quarters.</p>
        <p>By today, about 25 remained in another shelter at the Hudson Falls High School.</p>
        <p>At 10 this morning, a team from the Findlay, Ohio, offices of the International Technologies Corporation, hired by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, hooked a hose to the rail car and began transferring the gas to another tanker.</p>
        <p>The original tanker had a capacity of 30,000 gallons, roughly equivalent to that of three tractor-trailers, Mr. Fruchter said.</p>
        <p>The tanker car from Canadian Terra International had been in the rail yard, operated by a division of Canadian Pacific Railway, since Aug. 17, said Michel Spenard, a spokesman for the railway. The ammonia was being taken to the Finch, Pruyn &amp; Company paper mill in Glens Falls, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The mill uses anhydrous ammonia to break down wood fiber during its conversion to paper pulp.</p>
        <p>The ammonia can be smelled at 2 parts per million, tolerated without protection at up to 25 parts per million and is an immediate danger to humans at 300 parts per million, said Jeff Bechtel, a hazardous materials coordinator for the E.P.A. On Wednesday night, he said, readings ranged from 105 parts per million at the tanker to 35 in the rail yard, to 5 to 10 at the high school.</p>
        <p>The hurried evacuation caused some unexpected problems. Many had to leave their pets behind. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals of Upstate New York helped retrieve 100 pets.</p>
        <p>Others forgot their pills. Donald Bentley, 72, was given help in fetching his 19 medications. He and his wife, Roberta, 57, stayed Tuesday night with her mother in Rutland, Vt., 50 miles away, and then at a motel.</p>
        <p>''I'm supposed to go to work tomorrow, but what am I going to do about these clothes, which I've been wearing for three days?'' Mrs. Bentley asked, clutching her toy Pekingese, Mayli.</p>
