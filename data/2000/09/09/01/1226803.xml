        <p>In a move intended to shore up support for the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, the clearinghouses for the two markets introduced a plan today that would cut settlement costs by 90 percent for certain trades.</p>
        <p>Brokers have expressed concern about the potential for escalating costs should the London and Frankfurt exchanges combine to form a pan-European bourse called iX. Winning the support of brokers is crucial for the London Stock Exchange in its attempts to ward off a hostile bid from OM Gruppen A.B., the Swedish company that runs the Stockholm stock exchange.</p>
        <p>''It's a good workable blueprint,'' said Brian Mairs, a spokesman for the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers.</p>
        <p>While today's proposal went a long way toward addressing shareholder concerns, questions about how the savings would be achieved and who would benefit the most underscore the difficulty that European stock exchanges were facing as they tried folding dissimilar technologies and regulations into one entity. A certain amount of overlap in terms of how trades are settled has led some shareholders of the London Stock Exchange to call the proposal a political Band-Aid, rather than the most economically viable solution.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, since the plan laid out by the London settlement firm, CrestCo, and its Frankfurt counterpart, Clearstream, is not contingent upon the formation of iX, it remains unclear how effective the measures will be in warding off the Swedish bid. CrestCo has said that it will work with whichever partner London exchange shareholders choose.</p>
        <p>''This can go ahead without iX,'' Don Cruickshank, the chairman of the London Stock Exchange, said today at a news conference.</p>
        <p>Under the plan, which could be introduced by next summer, the cost of domestic trades will remain constant, while the price of cross-border trades could fall by as much as 90 percent. Transaction costs for trading pan-European stocks are more than 10 times those for trading stocks in the United States, according to an estimate by Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>Only trades made through a so-called central counterparty, a kind of clearinghouse system intended to allow institutional investors to remain anonymous in trades, will be subject to the savings. Since most retail brokers do not use such a system, it is unclear how much they will benefit.</p>
        <p>Institutional investors accounted for most international trades last year on the London exchange, which amounted to $:2.4 trillion, or $3.48 trillion, compared with $:1.4 trillion, or $2.03 trillion, for domestic trades.</p>
        <p>''In essence this is good news,'' said Michael Clark, a director of the British brokerage house Charles &amp; Stanley &amp; Company, which owns 100,000 shares of the London Stock Exchange. ''What bearing it has on a decision regarding iX, I'm not sure.''</p>
