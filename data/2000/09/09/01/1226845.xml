        <p>After saying definitively last week that he had decided on a course of treatment for his prostate cancer, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has said three times this week, including yesterday, that he has not made a decision.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to express my leanings until I actually decide it,'' Mr. Giuliani said yesterday in extensive remarks about his cancer treatment during a news conference at City Hall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's public comments in the last month about his treatment for his illness have sometimes been confusing.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 1, in a live television interview with Tom Brokaw on MSNBC, the mayor said for the first time that he had been undergoing preliminary hormone treatments for two and a half months and that the hormones had reduced the levels of prostate specific antigens in his blood to ''minuscule'' amounts. He said he would decide on a final treatment, either surgery or radiation, within a few weeks.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Giuliani said he had decided on a final treatment but that he did not want to disclose it. Then on Tuesday, Mr. Giuliani told Diane Sawyer on ''Good Morning America'' that he had not made a final decision and reiterated that Wednesday with David Letterman on Mr. Letterman's talk show and yesterday to reporters at City Hall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also emphasized that the hormones, which he said had reduced his prostate specific antigen, or P.S.A., level were only a preliminary treatment and that he would definitely have either surgery or radiation within a month or two.</p>
        <p>Doctors have said that radiation treatments may well be an out-patient procedure, while surgery could require him to take up to three weeks off from work. Mr. Giuliani had earlier indicated that he was leaning toward radiation, but his recent comments seemed to have left the door open to the possibility of surgery.</p>
        <p>Surgery is the choice of most men of Mr. Giuliani's age, 56. It has a high cure rate, but it also can cause impotence and incontinence. Doctors say that radiation, particularly in the form of ''seeds'' inserted into the prostate, may affect sexual function less, but its longterm cure rates are not known.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that his  P.S.A. level, which he said had fallen to below 1, indicated that the growth of his cancer had been arrested but that ''it wouldn't necessarily last.'' Doctors say that over time, cancer cells can become resistant to hormone treatments.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael J. Droller, the chairman of urology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, said yesterday that a P.S.A. level of 4 was ''the traditional threshold'' for more evaluation of a patient but that many other factors determined whether someone has cancer. Dr. Droller is not involved in Mr. Giuliani's case.</p>
