        <p>A federal prosecutor who warned Attorney General Janet Reno last year that Justice Department officials might have withheld evidence in the investigation of the standoff with the Branch Davidians outside Waco, Tex., may soon be indicted by prosecutors working for the special counsel, John C. Danforth.</p>

        <p>A federal prosecutor who warned Attorney General Janet Reno last year that Justice Department officials might have withheld evidence in the investigation of the standoff with the Branch Davidians outside Waco, Tex., may soon be indicted by prosecutors working for the special counsel, John C. Danforth.</p>
        <p>People close to the former assistant United States attorney in Waco, Bill Johnston, said today that he had been told by Mr. Danforth's office that he would soon face charges that could include obstruction of justice and making false statements to federal investigators.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Johnston nor Mr. Danforth could be reached for comment. But Mr. Johnston's lawyer, Michael J. Kennedy of New York, confirmed to The Dallas Morning News that Mr. Johnston was facing indictment. ''This law office and Mr. Johnston believe that he was unfairly targeted for his frequent criticism of the U.S. government and for blowing the whistle on the government's efforts to mislead the public about the government's use of pyrotechnic devices against the Branch Davidians,'' Mr. Kennedy said in a written statement quoted on the newspaper's Web site this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Last August, Mr. Johnston helped reignite controversy over the Waco standoff when he wrote to Ms. Reno. ''I have formed the belief that facts may have been kept from you -- and quite possibly are being kept from you even now, by components of the department,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Although he remained on the government payroll for six months after sending the letter, it effectively ended his career with the federal government. He resigned in February.</p>
        <p>The letter sparked further inquiry into the Waco incident that led to the deaths of about 80 people when the Branch Davidian compound burned on April 19, 1993, and helped convince Ms. Reno to appoint Mr. Danforth to reopen the matter.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Danforth issued his preliminary report and found that there was no evidence of a ''massive conspiracy and cover-up'' after the 51-day siege and that there was no evidence to support allegations that the military had played an active role in the incident.</p>
