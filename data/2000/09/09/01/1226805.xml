        <p>Workers at Volkswagen Mexico negotiated a raise of more than double the inflation rate, ending a two-week battle that included a walkout at their factory in Puebla, the only one in the world that produces trendy Beetles.</p>
        <p>Labor leaders hailed the settlement. But some economists expressed concern that the 21 percent increase could set off a wave of excessive wage proposals by increasingly aggressive unions and threaten efforts to control inflation.</p>
        <p>The company agreed to raise salaries 13 percent and give workers a 5 percent productivity bonus plus a 3 percent increase in benefits.</p>
        <p>The union's general secretary, Jose Luis Rodriguez, said, ''We think that salaries should not be based on inflation, but the performance of the workers and the results of the company.''</p>
        <p>Although the workers are the highest paid in the industry, they had earned an average $2.30 an hour. VW workers in Germany earn an average $27 an hour, Mr. Rodriguez said.</p>
        <p>The accord is increasing concern that the raise might become a benchmark for other unions, with increases that far exceed the inflation rate. ''It is most likely that other labor unions are going to try to follow this example,'' the director of Grupo Economistas y Asociados, Mauricio Gonzalez Gomez, said. ''But it might not be a healthy signal. We are running the risk of starting off an inflationary spiral.''</p>
