        <p>ART museums are not what you think of first in connection with the natural glories of Maine, but there are no fewer than seven significant ones in this sparsely populated state. And why not? With its wealth of woods, water and mountains, Maine has always lured artists, among them Winslow Homer, Martin Johnson Heade, Marsden Hartley, Childe Hassam, John Marin, Alex Katz, Robert Indiana and Maurice Prendergast.</p>
        <p>Where there are artists, there are museums to reap their work, and that's the case here. Each of the seven institutions -- three ''free standing'' and four attached to colleges -- has its own distinctive collection, primarily in American art, and its own approach to acquisition and display.</p>
        <p>The Portland Museum of Art owns a signature group of works by Homer, including his first oil painting, ''The Sharpshooter.'' The Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, with enormous holdings of work by the Wyeth family, devotes itself to delineating Maine's role in American art. The Ogunquit Museum of American Art has a magical setting and a medley of works by artists of the turn-of-the-century Ogunquit Art Colony.</p>
        <p>A problem for the museums was to make themselves more accessible. The answer was a collaborative effort: among other initiatives, they banded together to form the Maine Art Museum Trail, inspired by the tourist-luring Connecticut Impressionist Art Trail set up by a group of museums a few years ago. The Maine Art Museum Trail is outlined in a 12-page color brochure and map that highlights the attractions of each.</p>
        <p>Here, in greater detail, is what you'll find should you follow the trail.</p>
        <p>The best known of the Maine Seven, the PORTLAND MUSEUM OF ART, was founded in 1882 by local art patrons as the Portland Society of Art. Today it occupies three buildings of architectural significance -- the latest opened in 1983 -- in the downtown Portland arts district, a lively area fronting Casco Bay where sea gulls scream incessantly overhead.</p>
        <p>Of the seven, Portland's collections are the most extensive, if not the most wide ranging. (That distinction goes to the Bowdoin College Museum of Art.) The Portland holdings consist of more than 15,000 objects in the fine and decorative arts, from the 18th century to now. The heart of the museum is its Maine collection, which includes works by Homer, Marin, Edward Hopper, Louise Nevelson and Andrew Wyeth. Degas, Picasso, Monet and Rodin are among the European masters represented, and there are strong holdings in prints and photography.</p>
        <p>Portland's two big current shows are ''Alberto Giacometti'' and ''N. C. Wyeth: Precious Time.'' The Giacometti show is said to be the first ever in Maine for this influential Swiss sculptor (1901-1966), who obsessively explored the way figures and objects occupy space. On view are more than 50 paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints from the collection of Herbert Lust, a New York investment banker and longtime friend of the artist who contributes a lively memoir to the catalog.</p>
        <p>Among the highlights are a highly charged 1949 painting of Giacometti's brother, Diego, that reveals the energetic intensity with which the artist worked over his subjects. A haunting bronze head of Diego (1961) and a half-size bronze, ''Chignon Woman'' (1949), done in Giacometti's famously attenuated style, demonstrate his ability to suggest the provisional, existential presence of humanity. And the drawings and lithographs give a sense of his constant inquiry, through line, into spatial relationships. Altogether a rewarding show.</p>
        <p>Quite different in character is the show of work by Newell Convers Wyeth (1882-1945), the father of Andrew and the grandfather of James. A justly famous illustrator known for his flamboyant depictions of derring-do, N. C. aspired to be known as a fine-art painter. The show contrasts his illustrations, like the swashbuckling cover for a 1911 edition of ''Treasure Island,'' with the lower-key paintings of landscape, home and family that he did between commercial assignments.</p>
        <p>In these the style ranges from realism to Post-Impressionism, but the work, compared with that of more venturesome artists of the period, rarely rises above convention.</p>
        <p>There are some fine scenes of the wild Maine coast, a crisp view of ''Eight Bells'' (1936), his home in Port Clyde, Me., and several canvases of lobstermen at work. One of these, ''Untitled (Lobstermen)'' (1927), is a half-stab at modernism, done in a fractured, prismatic style that bespeaks an acquaintance with Cubism. He will be remembered for his illustrations.</p>
        <p>Farnsworth Art Museum</p>
        <p>There's a lot more Wyeth work -- by all three generations -- at the Farnsworth, which houses an impressive collection of American art, some 8,000 works strong, from the late 18th century to the present, with a special focus on Maine-related work.</p>
        <p>The chronological range is from Gilbert Stuart and Washington Allston to Nevelson (born, like the museum, in Rockland) and lesser-known current artists like Dozier Bell and Brett Bigbee. It also has the most extensive collection of Wyeth art in the world: several thousand works by N. C., Andrew and James.</p>
        <p>The museum, in the coastal town of Rockland, opened in 1948 in the crisp white Greek Revival mansion bequeathed -- along with a $1.3-million endowment -- by Lucy Copeland Farnsworth and augmented after her death by a handsome red brick Colonial Revival building. The Center for the Wyeth Family in Maine, a study and exhibition center in a 19th-century church building, opened in 1998, and in June of this year the unveiling of the Jamien Morehouse Wing completed the museum's Main Street facade.</p>
        <p>The museum also owns the Olson house, seen at the top of the hill in Andrew Wyeth's famous ''Christina's World'' (1948). The painting has just been lent to the Farnsworth by its owner, the Museum of Modern Art, and for the first time in 50 years will be on view at the Farnsworth, starting tomorrow and continuing through Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>The Farnsworth's current show, ''One Nation: Patriots and Pirates Portrayed by N. C. Wyeth and James Wyeth,'' pairs grandfather with grandson. Its 80 paintings and drawings depict various manifestations of patriotism since the early 1900's. The show reinforces the adage that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree: the White House is seen by N. C. in a mannered illustration of its construction done for Hallmark Cards (circa 1930); James renders it in a snowy, starry platitudinous glow on Christmas Eve, 1981.</p>
        <p>Other N. C. chestnuts include a Norman Rockwell-ish rendering (circa 1923) of Lincoln giving his second inaugural address in 1865, and various World War II propaganda pieces, among them ''Soldiers of the Soil'' (1942), in which a farmer tills his land watched over by a clutch of Allied flags hovering among puffy clouds. As for James, works like his posthumous close-up of President John F. Kennedy, hand placed thoughtfully to mouth (1967), and ''Islanders'' (1990), a couple seated on the porch of a weather beaten house sporting a large American flag, demonstrate that his development as a painter has not gone much beyond that of his father, Andrew.</p>
        <p>Ogunquit Museum</p>
        <p>Ogunquit, once a small fishing village, has been an artists' colony for more than 100 years, frequented at various times by the likes of Hopper, Robert Henri, George Bellows and Walt Kuhn, and reaching its peak in the 1920's and 30's. The Ogunquit Museum of American Art, built in 1952 and since expanded to almost double its original size, is the only one in Maine devoted exclusively to 20th-century American art. Another incentive to visit is its spectacular siting on a rocky cove, with nearly three acres of landscaped grounds, punctuated by outdoor sculptures, that offer an unimpeded view of the mighty Atlantic.</p>
        <p>The museum sprang from the Ogunquit Art Association, founded in 1928 and later led by Henry Strater, a prolific realist painter who took up summer residence and became a leader in the art association. In the early 1950's, believing that Ogunquit was ready for a museum representing a wide spectrum of 20th-century art, he bought land on the cove and hired an architect.</p>
        <p>The museum is a light, airy structure that combines Maine granite and hard pine with classical motifs. It now has about 7,500 square feet of space and a permanent collection of more than 1,400 paintings, sculptures and graphics. The artists include Marin, Hassam, Homer, Hopper, Thomas Hart Benton, Charles Demuth, Charles Burchfield, Morris Graves, Rockwell Kent, Fairfield Porter, Gaston Lachaise and a multitude of lesser-knowns.</p>
        <p>The fun of it is that you never can tell what you'll find among this miscellany, from the truly mediocre to the fine but relatively unknown portraits of Harmon Neill to Hartley's marvelous ''Still Life With Eel'' (circa 1914), a small, lighthearted charmer in high-keyed colors, in which sinuous shapes are played off against hard-edged geometrics.</p>
        <p>Ogunquit mounts several exhibitions a season, and although it usually closes on Sept. 30, this year for the first time it will stay open through Oct. 15. The current show is ''Painted Air: American Impressionism,'' with more than 130 oils, pastels and watercolors covering the period 1880 to 1920.</p>
        <p>But there is no denying that the American brand of Impressionism lacked the elan of the European movement, and its works tend to pale by comparison. Along with stellar names like Bellows, Hassam, Henri, Prendergast, Mary Cassatt, Lilla Cabot Perry, John Singer Sargent, Julian Alden Weir and James Abbott McNeill Whistler, this show includes much weaker talents. It needs pruning.</p>
        <p>Bowdoin College Museum</p>
        <p>The Bowdoin College Museum of Art's permanent collection goes back to 1811, making it the earliest collegiate art collection in the United States. The bequest of James Bowdoin 3rd (1752-1811), who served as Thomas Jefferson's minister to France and Spain in the early 1800's (and for whose statesman father the college was named), bestowed 70 paintings and 141 drawings on this small but choice college. But it took almost another century before art crept into the Bowdoin curriculum, and the gift was fully appreciated.</p>
        <p>In 1894 the Walker Art Building opened on campus, given by two sisters, Harriet and Sophia Walker. Wishing to honor their uncle, Theophilus Wheeler Walker, a Boston businessman who had helped establish a modest gallery at the college, they commissioned the prestigious firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White to design the new building. The firm did a splendid, all-out Beaux-Arts job, including a copper dome and the placing of four murals by prominent artists of the period in the rotunda.</p>
        <p>A plaque set into the rotunda floor  by the sisters warns that the building is to be used ''solely for art purposes.'' And that it has, expanded and augmented in 1975 by a Visual Arts Center designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes. Next summer the Walker building is slated to be renovated and expanded again, by the New York architectural firm of Tod Williams, Billie Tsien and Associates.</p>
        <p>Today Bowdoin has a distinguished permanent collection whose 14,000 objects span a wide range of cultures and periods. The American holdings are the strongest, and include one of the most important groups of Colonial and Federal portraiture in the country, with works by John Singleton Copley, Robert Feke, Rembrandt Peale, Thomas Sully and Gilbert Stuart. Outstanding is Feke's monumental portrait of Brig. Gen. Samuel Waldo (circa 1748) done up in red and gold finery, to commemorate this Bostonian's victory over the French at Louisbourg in Nova Scotia.</p>
        <p>A recent find was a lively 1805 portrait of Sarah Bowdoin, wife of James Bowdoin 3rd, by the French painter Louis-Leopold Boilly. It surfaced last year in an estate sale in northern France.</p>
        <p>Among the 19th- and 20th-century artists represented are Hartley, Heade, Homer, Sargent, Thomas Eakins, and of course Andrew Wyeth. A major gift in the 1960's added paintings by Arshile Gorky, Alex Katz, Franz Kline and Jack Tworkov. Such diverse artists as Man Ray, Eva Hesse and Jack Tworkov are also in the collection.</p>
        <p>But that's by no means all. On permanent view also are Assyrian bas-reliefs from the ninth century B.C.; sculpture, coins and other objects from a strong ancient Mediterranean collection; and a selection of European paintings and decorative arts that focus on the Italian Renaissance. Changing exhibitions occur here, too, including a much-acclaimed show devoted to Emily Nelligan, a little-known Maine artist who chronicles the natural phenomena of Cranberry Island in remarkable charcoal drawings.</p>
        <p>Colby College Museum</p>
        <p>The student population of this beautiful neo-Georgian campus in the heart of Maine is only 1,750 strong. But the Colby College Museum of Art, founded in 1959, has rapidly become -- with three major additions over the last decade -- the largest in the state. It houses a deep and varied collection of American art, covering three centuries, in 28,000 square feet of elegant gallery space.</p>
        <p>The collection began with a small group of works and one gallery in the early 1950's, a sidebar to the college's growing art history and studio programs. But alumni and other donors, gently persuaded by a strong board and a dedicated director, Hugh Gourley 3rd, have swelled the holdings to some 3,500 objects and an acquisitions fund of $6.5 million.</p>
        <p>One enhancement is the Paul J. Schupf wing, opened in 1996 for the display of works by Alex Katz, a Maine summer resident since the 1950's. Covering five decades, the more than 500 objects were given by Mr. Katz starting in 1992, with the proviso that a gallery be built to house them. Mr. Schupf, a longtime Katz collector, obliged. One of the few museum wings in the country devoted to a single artist, it shows his paintings, cut-outs and drawings in rotational displays.</p>
        <p>Another strength is the new Lunder wing, made possible by a challenge grant from Peter and Paula Lunder of Waterville (Mr. Lunder is a Colby alumnus) and opened in 1999.</p>
        <p>Built to display the museum's outstanding collection of early American, Impressionist and early-20th-century art, much of which lay in  storage, it contains 13 spacious galleries, showing the work of artists from Copley, Stuart and Charles Willson Peale to Hartley, Porter, Georgia O'Keeffe, Rockwell Kent, Chuck Close and Nevelson. Two galleries display more than 50 paintings, watercolors, drawings and prints by Marin, many given by the artist's son.</p>
        <p>The museum has recently gone in for large commissions as well. A big, bright wall painting by Sol LeWitt greets visitors in the lobby, and a monumental work by Richard Serra has just been installed in a new sculpture court, made possible by Mr. Schupf, that has become part of the main facade.</p>
        <p>Nor does Colby neglect temporary exhibitions: its ambitious program includes the current ''Modernism and Abstraction: Treasures From the Smithsonian American Art Museum,'' a survey of 20th-century developments illustrated by artists including Hartley, Joseph Stella, Stuart Davis, Jennifer Bartlett, David Hockney and Eric Fischl.</p>
        <p>In short, a place that's going places.</p>
        <p>Bates College Museum</p>
        <p>Founded in honor of Lewiston's most famous native, Marsden Hartley (1877-1943), the Bates College Museum of Art is the largest repository of his drawings, which serve as the cornerstone of the museum's collection. The 99 sheets, along with oil sketches and memorabilia, were donated in 1955 by Hartley's niece, Norma Berger. The drawings include Maine landscapes, but most are of people, including the fishermen and women he sketched in the mid-1930's and early 40's while living in New England and the Canadian maritime provinces.</p>
        <p>The gift prompted the designation of a single classroom for showing the drawings and other works, but as enthusiasm built for the visual arts at this small college, the classroom gave way to a museum, opened in 1986 as part of the Olin Arts Center, financed by a gift from the F. W. Olin Foundation in New York.</p>
        <p>The museum's collection of 4,000 objects, mostly works on paper, has largely been shaped by the Hartley founding gift. Drawings by some of his friends, including Carl Sprinchorn and Mark Tobey, were added, along with photographs of the artist by George Platt Lynes and Alfredo Valente, dating from the 1930's. The photographs attracted others, and today the museum has a good collection that includes work by Walker Evans and Arthur Rothstein as well as more contemporary talents like Paul Caponigro and Jonathan Bailey.</p>
        <p>American art had been given to Bates since shortly after the college's founding in 1855. Some of it came from local artists, like D. D. Coombs (1850-1938), a painter in the Romantic tradition who turned out boring landscapes. But there are also works by artists who came to Maine and stayed, like William and Marguerite Zorach, their daughter Dahlov Ipcar, and the painter of Maine woods, Neil Welliver.</p>
        <p>A print collection of some 3,000 works has also been established. Some of its artists can be studied in depth, with more than 100 wood engravings by Homer and the entire print output of Joseph Pennell (1860-1926). Bates also mounts temporary shows, like this summer's ''Eloquent Objects,'' a group of still lifes by well-known and emerging artists.</p>
        <p>If not the most exciting stop on the trail, there are, still, all those wonderful Hartleys.</p>
        <p>University of Maine Museum</p>
        <p>The big news about this underfinanced museum, which specializes in works on paper, is that it is pushing hard to leave its University of Maine campus in Orono for nearby Bangor, where it will occupy the first three floors of a renovated former department store.</p>
        <p>The move results from a partnership between the City of Bangor and the university. In its new site the permanent collection of some 6,000 works will get improved climate control and museum-quality storage space, along with -- it is hoped -- a much larger audience.</p>
        <p>The museum began in 1946 as the University of Maine Art Collection, with Vincent Hartgen, a painter who taught at the university, serving as curator. The collection -- primarily works on paper -- ranged from Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo to Marc Chagall and Hassam. In 1988 the collection was officially designated as a museum, and is housed on campus in a weather-beaten neo-Classical granite structure built in 1903 to serve as the university's library.</p>
        <p>By ''begging, borrowing and stealing,'' as the current director, Wally Mason, puts it, the museum has succeeded in assembling a presentable small collection that includes paintings by Alfred Bricher and George Inness and prints and photographs by artists ranging from Homer and Marin to Richard Diebenkorn, Roy Lichtenstein and Berenice Abbott. About a third of the artists represented come from Maine.</p>
        <p>The Robert Venn Carr Collection of 285 works on paper, acquired in 1986, has contributed much to the museum's holdings in contemporary art, representing artists like Max Beckmann, Jim Dine and Robert Rauschenberg. Recent temporary shows included one of the photographer Evelyn Hofer. And, lacking exhibition galleries for its permanent collection, the museum wisely rotates it in exhibitions, like the current ''Jump Into It: Water as Muse,'' a medley of watery themes that includes 79 works by 58 artists, among them Marin, Willem de Kooning, Carl Sprinchorn, Jennifer Bartlett, David Hockney and Susan Shatter.</p>
        <p>Things are looking up, and meanwhile the museum is performing its functions of acquiring, conserving and exhibiting in very positive ways.</p>

        <p>ART REVIEW  Correction:  September 25, 2000, Monday  An art review in Weekend on Sept. 1 about small museums in Maine misstated the birthplace of the artist Louise Nevelson, whose work is at the Farnsworth in Rockland, Me. She was born in 1899 in Kiev, then part of Russia, not in Rockland, where her family arrived in 1905.</p>
        <p>Editors' Note:  September 30, 2000, Saturday  An art review in Weekend on Sept. 1 about the history and collections of seven small museums in Maine commented briefly on a temporary exhibition that had recently opened at the Ogunquit Museum of American Art, ''Painted Air: American Impressionism,'' on view through Oct. 15. After listing some artists represented in the show, the reviewer wrote, ''It needs pruning.''</p>
        <p>The show had not yet been installed when the reviewer visited the museum, and the review should have made it clear that the opinion was based on the catalog alone.</p>
