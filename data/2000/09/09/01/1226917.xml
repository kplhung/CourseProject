        <p>Vince Carter, dunking in garbage time. It is a little more than one nation should have to take, especially the country where Carter is professionally employed.</p>
        <p>In his international debut, Carter, the skywalking guard of the Toronto Raptors, electrified a crowd of more than 7,000 on the University of Hawaii campus last night in Honolulu. He scored 29 points in 19 minutes as the United States throttled the Canadian national team, 99-70, in the Americans' first tuneup for the Olympic Games later this month in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Rowan Barrett led Canada with 22 points.</p>
        <p>Canada narrowed its deficit to 16 points with nearly 10 minutes remaining in the second half and began to make it a contest. But Jason Kidd and Gary Payton turned up the defensive intensity, and even the one established N.B.A. player on the Canadian roster, Steve Nash, began to feel the pressure. He committed six turnovers in 34 minutes.</p>
        <p>Ray Allen added 18 points, Alonzo Mourning had 13 points and Kevin Garnett had 10 points and 9 rebounds in 19 minutes. The United States led by 47-35 at halftime, then shot 64.3 percent in the second half.</p>
        <p>The United States will meet a team of American college stars tomorrow before going to Japan for two exhibition games.</p>

        <p>ELLIOTT SAYS HE'LL RETURN: Sean Elliott announced yesterday that he would return to the San Antonio Spurs for at least one more season, saying he feels great a year after a kidney transplant and wants the challenge of basketball in his life.</p>
        <p>The 6-8 Elliott, a 32-year-old forward who made a stirring comeback by rejoining his team last March, said he was just not ready to retire.</p>
        <p>''I love the challenge,'' said Elliott, a standout perimeter player who helped the Spurs win their first N.B.A. title in 1999. (AP)</p>
