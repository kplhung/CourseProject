        <p>The nation's largest operator of welfare-to-work programs violated federal law by paying lower wages to women than to men placed in the same jobs in a Milwaukee warehouse, according to a decision made public yesterday by the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>
        <p>The company, Maximus Inc., has been under mounting criticism for its business practices in recent months. A state judge in Manhattan has held up the Giuliani administration's plans to award Maximus more than $100 million in contracts to help welfare recipients find work. And  state auditors in Wisconsin recently found that the company had billed the state for $466,000 in improper or questionable expenses.</p>
        <p>The federal commission's ruling found that a woman placed in warehouse jobs by MaxStaff, the company's temporary employment agency, was paid $7.01 an hour while five male co-workers got $8.13.</p>
        <p>''We're obviously very disappointed with the determination,'' said Rachael Rowland, a spokeswoman for Maximus. ''We respectfully disagree with it. We remain confident that no discrimination occurred in this case.''</p>
        <p>She repeated an earlier explanation by Maximus executives that the difference was based on the woman's being paid ''a training wage'' in a program for people with little job history.</p>
        <p>But the commission ruled against the company. ''Examination of the evidence indicates that female employees working in warehouse positions had substantially equal qualifications to males working in the same positions, but were paid lower wages even though females were performing the same duties as males,'' the ruling said.</p>
        <p>Tracy Jones, the woman who filed the complaint, said she did have job experience, including work as a machine operator, a warehouse carton packer and a building maintenance worker. ''It was my prior experience as a union steward that helped me recognize this was wrong,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ellen Bravo, the director of 9to5, the National Association of Working Women, an advocacy group, told Wisconsin legislators who are auditing the company that the Jones case revealed a fundamental flaw in the state's welfare-to-work program, designed in part by Jason A. Turner, now New York City's welfare commissioner.</p>
        <p>''The goal was not to remove women from poverty, but simply from the welfare rolls,'' she said. ''Consequently, any job was good enough.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jones, now 33, said she had asked a MaxStaff supervisor a year ago why she, the only woman, was being paid less than all the men. The supervisor told her that she was mistaken, and later warned workers that they could be fired if they discussed wages. At that point, the commission said in its ruling, the company began hiring males at a lower rate of pay -- apparently in an effort to cover up sex discrimination.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Jones privately challenged male employees to prove their earnings and collected pay stubs that she took to the commission. Eight days later, she was fired.</p>
        <p>The law requires the commission to now try to eliminate the unlawful employment practices with persuasion and conciliation. If that fails, the commission can go to court.</p>
