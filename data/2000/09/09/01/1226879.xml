        <p>In the most scathing report prompted by the accident at the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant in February, an independent monitor has found that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted inadequate plant inspections as far back as 1997 and relied on flawed analyses, inexperienced staff members and the company it was supposed to regulate.</p>
        <p>The report, released today by the Office of the Inspector General, was no more sparing in its criticism of Consolidated Edison, the owner of Indian Point 2.

Describing the utility as lacking a ''commitment to excellence,'' with employees who sometimes did only ''enough to get by,'' the report says that Con Edison may have been able to prevent the accident -- the worst in the plant's 26-year history -- had it not ''missed the vast majority'' of defects in the generators during a 1997 inspection.</p>

        <p>In the most scathing report prompted by the accident at the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant in February, an independent monitor has found that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission conducted inadequate plant inspections as far back as 1997 and relied on flawed analyses, inexperienced staff members and the company it was supposed to regulate.</p>
        <p>The report, released today by the Office of the Inspector General, was no more sparing in its criticism of Consolidated Edison, the owner of Indian Point 2. The plant, in the Westchester County town of Buchanan, 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, was shut down in February when a steam-generator tube ruptured and caused a radioactive leak. Describing the utility as lacking a ''commitment to excellence,'' with employees who sometimes did only ''enough to get by,'' the report says that Con Edison may have been able to prevent the accident -- the worst in the plant's 26-year history -- had it not ''missed the vast majority'' of defects in the generators during a 1997 inspection.</p>
        <p>For months, local officials, residents of the area and environmental groups have railed primarily against Con Edison with a litany of technical, communications and inspections problems related to Indian Point 2. But today's report marks the most comprehensive criticism of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with blunt comments about how senior managers may have frowned upon tougher plant inspections for the sake of expediency and how senior engineers treated the steam generators as low risk and low priority.</p>
        <p>The report comes three weeks after Con Edison announced that it would replace the generators before reopening the plant. So while the findings by the Office of the Inspector General, which operates as an internal affairs department within the N.R.C., are supposed to spur reform, specific steps have already been taken to address technical deficiencies.</p>
        <p>Even so, the report raises larger questions about whether the commission's laxity at Indian Point 2 was an isolated case or part of something more widespread.</p>
        <p>''What you've got here is a very protective regulatory agency protecting the business it's supposed to be regulating,'' said Representative Sue W. Kelly, a Republican who represents the district and pushed for the investigation.</p>
        <p>In response, Neil A. Sheehan, a spokesman for the commission, said that ''we take very seriously the critical report of the agency's Inspector General of the handling of the Feb. 15 steam generator tube failure of Indian Point 2.'' He said that the N.R.C. chairman, Richard A. Meserve, had directed the commission's staff to do a comprehensive analysis of the Inspector General's criticisms and come up with recommendations for corrective actions by Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Edison, said tonight that he had not yet seen the Inspector General's report. But he repeated the position that the company has held since February:</p>
        <p>''The inspection in 1997 was done with the most up-to-date technology available at its time,'' he said. ''We complied with all necessary procedures, and our inspection was even approved by the N.R.C. However, we've moved on and are proceeding with the replacement of the steam generators, and expect to have the plant running by the end of year.''</p>
        <p>James P. Riccio, senior policy analyst for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group, said the report showed, ''that senior staff is more concerned with allowing these reactors to run, rather than to insure that they're running safely.''</p>
        <p>Had there been tougher oversight -- particularly since the generators at Indian Point 2 were among the oldest of their kind still in use -- inspectors would probably have detected that a tube in one of them had corroded by almost 100 percent, and would have been able to prevent a subsequent rupture, the report says.</p>
        <p>As for Con Edison, the report says that, among other deficiencies, the company demonstrated chronic problems with emergency preparedness, even during scheduled drills.</p>
        <p>In short, the report suggests that both the agency and the company, on many occasions, simply did not bother to take the extra step, preferring instead to do the minimum and act passively. As a result, some watchdogs of nuclear power have urged Congress to hold hearings.</p>
        <p>''If there is not a Congressional oversight hearing,'' said David Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer with the Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Washington, ''and there was an accident a month or year from now, where the N.R.C.'s lack of review is again a factor, I don't know how the federal government could tell the American people, we did everything to protect you.''</p>
