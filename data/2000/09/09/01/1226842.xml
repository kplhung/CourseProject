        <p>A day after a devastating fire here, Ann Ring stood in front of her heat-scorched home, its vinyl siding dripping like melted cheese, and marveled at a Hudson River view she thought she had lost forever.</p>
        <p>As thick smoke rose from stubborn pockets of the blaze, Mrs. Ring said she was thankful that the wall of flame had been kept from consuming her home. It had destroyed a luxury apartment complex under construction, nine nearby houses and an occupied apartment building.</p>
        <p>But like many residents of this former factory town, Mrs. Ring, 58, said she was also angry -- about the wave of development that is quickly transforming Edgewater and other waterfront towns into the so-called Gold Coast.</p>
        <p>''This used to be a quaint place,'' said Mrs. Ring, a school crossing guard. ''But they've gone and put up these ugly monsters. They're ruining the place.''</p>
        <p>Coming a month after fires ripped through two Jersey City high-rises, the blaze on Wednesday night raised new questions about whether development is outstripping the ability of local governments to regulate it and favoring the needs of developers over residents.</p>
        <p>With Edgewater's population of 6,000 expected to grow by as much as 2,000 in the next few years, many residents worry that growth will overwhelm this narrow river town, which is just two blocks wide and four miles long. ''We have one main road and three paid firemen,'' said Valory Bardinas, a City Council member. ''This development is not only jeopardizing our quality of life, but our safety, too.''</p>
        <p>As firefighters continued to spray arcs of water on the smoldering ruins today, arson investigators began trying to determine the cause of the blaze, which started at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday and rapidly consumed the timber-frame Avalon River Mews, a 408-unit luxury rental building that was under construction.</p>
        <p>Sam DeNorchia, Edgewater's fire chief, said the heat radiating from the blaze was so intense that it ignited the houses across Undercliff Avenue, about 50 feet away. Cars, trees and backyard swing sets were consumed as anxious homeowners stood by helplessly.</p>
        <p>Fire officials said tonight that at least 100 people were still waiting to return to their homes. Many were staying at a nearby Holiday Inn.</p>
        <p>Like many of those who live across the street from the Avalon River Mews site, Grethel Rambone had only unflattering words for the seven-story project, which she and others fought to have scaled down. Mrs. Rambone, 57, said that Edgewater's mayor and City Council were unsympathetic to their concerns. She and others cited the local planning board's decision to grant the developers a variance on zoning laws that would have required the western edge of the project to be set back at least 30 feet from the sidewalk; the variance allowed the developer a setback of only 6 feet.</p>
        <p>Had existing zoning been applied, the development would have been at least 24 feet farther from the homes that caught fire across the street.</p>
        <p>''It seems like the almighty dollar has taken over this town,'' said Mrs. Rambone, who has lived in Edgewater all her life. ''No one is stopping and thinking about the effect the development is having on the people already here.''</p>
        <p>Robert Corcoran, the City Council president, said that complaints about overdevelopment were off the mark. Nearly all of new construction in Edgewater, he pointed out, is on land that once held abandoned factories or decaying piers.</p>
        <p>After decades of post-industrial desolation in Edgewater -- and fiscal desperation -- the spate of new buildings is finally helping to fill the town's coffers, Mr. Corcoran said. ''I wouldn't call this development -- it's redevelopment,'' he said. ''This is a good thing for us.''</p>
        <p>Development is altering the face of once sleepy towns up and down the Hudson in New Jersey, polarizing communities and straining services. In the last two years, 23 office buildings and thousands of apartments have been built along the 17 miles of waterfront from Bayonne to Fort Lee.</p>
        <p>In Jersey City, where 20 new high-rises have gone up since 1990, fire officials are trying to cope with a new breed of building: the skyscraper. On July 20, a power surge set off fires in two new high-rises there, injuring four people and prompting complaints that fire alarms had failed to function.</p>
        <p>In an effort to grapple with the threat of high-rise blazes, the city's fire director is asking that all new buildings employ round-the-clock employees trained to deal with fires. Some developers, citing annual costs that could run as high as $250,000 a building, have balked at the proposal.</p>
        <p>In Edgewater, if all goes according to plan, nearly 100 acres of former industrial wasteland will be converted into residential and commercial use in the coming decade. The former Hills Bros. coffee plant is now an assisted living center, a postal service mailbag repair plant has given way to a shopping center and the luxury apartment complex that burned yesterday was rising atop the site of the former Alcoa factory.</p>
        <p>For Edgewater officials, Avalon River Mews was a long-awaited coup. For nearly 30 years, the parcel was a PCB-contaminated eyesore. In 1997, state and Bergen County officials reached an agreement with two local developers to clean up the land. A year later, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and New Jersey's environmental commissioner appeared at the site during demolition to showcase the project as a model of the state's so-called Brownfields Act, which is intended to entice developers to build on contaminated industrial sites.</p>
        <p>In the end, however, the developers sold the land to the current owners, Avalonbay Communities, for $13.5 million.</p>
        <p>While most residents initially supported the project, many who live nearby became opponents when they learned that the developers were asking for considerable variances. In the end, Avalonbay received a variance to allow more units than zoning permitted, although an earlier proposal to build three 16-story towers was scuttled by opponents.</p>
        <p>In recent months, several other projects have been approved despite objections from some who said they were too large. Last week, the planning board, whose members are appointed by the mayor, approved a $90 million project that includes 350 hotel rooms, 300 apartments and a shopping center. Ms. Bardinas, who was elected to the City Council last year, said that many residents thought that the mayor, Bryan Christiansen, and his supporters on the Council were too eager to please developers.</p>
        <p>''People feel like their voice is not being heard,'' she said. ''A lot of them are disillusioned.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Christiansen, who has been in office for 12 years, did not return phone calls seeking comment today.</p>
        <p>A group of residents led by the Independent Coalition for a Better Edgewater is now fighting a plan to sell off the town's last stretch of waterfront to developers. The group wants the town to issue bonds to acquire the property, a plan Mr. Christiansen has rejected.</p>
        <p>In interviews with nearly two dozen residents, many said they had mixed feelings about the good times that have washed over Edgewater.</p>
        <p>Dolores Lawlor, 62, who grew up here, worked in the factories and then bemoaned their departure, said she was glad the town finally had its own supermarket. But like others, she said she missed the languid pace and small-town familiarity.</p>
        <p>She recalled when River Road, recently widened to five lanes, was a meandering two-lane street. The mom-and-pop stores she remembers from her childhood have given way to suburban-style shopping plazas. The jaw-dropping views of Manhattan are largely obscured by gated communities, with names like Admiral's Walk and Mariner's Landing. And traffic, nearly everyone agrees, has become unbearable during rush hour.</p>
        <p>''It used to be one big family,'' Mrs. Lawlor said. ''There are so many strangers now, you don't even know your next-door neighbor.''</p>
