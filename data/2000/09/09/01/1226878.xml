        <p>Six security guards linked arms and fell into a phalanx around Jelena Dokic, protecting the Australian teenager against the rush of two Australian television crews and a dozen international journalists who had just witnessed her crisp 6-1, 6-4 dismissal of Miriam Oremans on Court 4.</p>
        <p>Even when a cameraman stumbled to the cement, steamrolled by the secret service-like escort, Dokic kept walking briskly, her steel blue eyes staring ahead. They were a one-way mirror only, damming the tears that fell one day before.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, 17-year-old Dokic watched as her father and coach, Damir, became enraged once again in public, verbally abusing tennis officials and staff for the fourth time at a tournament in the last two years. She cried as security guards removed her stocky, bearded father off the grounds in a disturbing scene that resulted in his ejection from the United States Open.</p>
        <p>Although Damir Dokic said Wednesday he would come to the grounds despite his ban, he did not attempt to enter yesterday, according to tournament officials. Jelena arrived at the National Tennis Center alone yesterday morning for practice, and was driven back to her Manhattan hotel so she could have lunch and receive last-minute instructions from her father.</p>
        <p>Her mother and younger brother did not come to New York, so she had no family to support during her afternoon match. Yet Dokic appeared stronger without father, as has been the case following his pattern of wild public confrontations. She did not flinch, but efficiently pounded her ground strokes with deep and severe angles, frustrating Oremans.</p>
        <p>Ten minutes after winning, she used a phone in the players' lobby to reach her father. ''I tried to call, but I couldn't get through,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Instead, she related her feelings to reporters.</p>
        <p>''I definitely feel relieved,'' Dokic said. ''I think getting through matches, to be able to play the same way that I do no matter what happens, it just makes me feel really good.''</p>
        <p>Dokic, who advanced to play Francesca Schiavone, a qualifier from Italy, in the third round, denied that her father's scene and subsequent absence affected her. Ranked No. 43 in the world and playing a woman ranked No. 93, Dokic drew a side court with one small grandstand in the back of the grounds. Although some cameramen and journalists lined the open side of the court the entire match, Dokic did not seem to notice.</p>
        <p>''Doesn't seem to distract me,'' she said. ''That's what the match today showed. I was there the whole time. It looks like an easy score line, but every point, I sort of concentrated on what I had to do and I was there on the court.''</p>
        <p>Oremans, from the Netherlands, was not surprised that Dokic was so focused. ''I remember last year in Birmingham, after he had that incident, she was the same, the next match, focused, her mind on the game,'' Oremans said. ''I give all the credit to her. It's very difficult to deal with a father like him.''</p>
        <p>Last year in Birmingham, England, Damir Dokic was ejected after shouting during her match, and then picked up by the police when they found him lying in the road. The next week, at Wimbledon, Dokic upset Martina Hingis in the first round and advanced to the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>This year at Wimbledon, Damir was ejected after his daughter's second-round victory. Unaffected, she won three straight matches en route to her semifinal loss to Lindsay Davenport.</p>
        <p>Dokic said yesterday that she would not search for another coach in the meantime. Coaches from the Saddlebrook Resort in Tampa, Fla., where she trains (and where her father, mother, Liliana, and brother, Savo, have purchased a house) were available for her yesterday, but she did not use them.</p>
        <p>Instead, Dokic and her father discussed how she had to attack Oremans's backhand.</p>
        <p>''I think eventually it's something you've got to deal with,'' she said. ''You've got to be able to play yourself. There's nobody out there that can play for you. I know what I have to work on and I know what I have to do. It's obviously hard not having anybody there, but I guess it's something I'm going to have to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Dokic said she was grateful for the support she has received from other players yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mary Pierce, whose father and former coach, Jim, received a lifetime ban from the Women's Tennis Association Tour in 1993, following Pierce's allegations of physical and mental abuse, said she would be more than willing to counsel Dokic.</p>
        <p>''How did I deal with my situation?'' said Pierce, 25. ''I kind of forgot about it, you know, it's been just a long time. I kind of put it behind me. I have no regrets of my past. You know, I think that's part of me, and that's part of what got me to where I am today.''</p>
        <p>Davenport was saddened.</p>
        <p>''It's a shame,'' she said. ''This has happened a number of times. It's probably time that he is reprimanded. You can't really treat people like that. We've worked so hard to get such positive story lines in women's tennis. Hopefully, it's just a little side note and people will forget about it and she'll be able to go on and play. I think she has it pretty rough.''</p>
