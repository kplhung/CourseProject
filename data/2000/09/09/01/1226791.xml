        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>UKRAINE: ECOLOGICAL DISASTER -- With hundreds of villagers in south-central Ukraine complaining of skin rashes and other symptoms of environmental poisoning, President Leonid Kuchma, left, declared the region about 320 miles south of Kiev an ecological disaster zone. Some officials said the outbreak was caused by chemical spills from a Soviet-era missile base, but others said high concentrations of nitrites in drinking water and foodstuffs indicated high fertilizer concentrations may have contaminated water supplies.</p>

        <p>NORWAY: RIGHTISTS GAIN -- The Progress Party, whose anti-immigration position has made it a political pariah, has moved into a statistical tie with the governing Labor Party for the first time in a new poll. Of the 1,000 people questioned by the Din Mening/Norsk Statistikk institute, 25 percent said they favored Progress among the country's eight largest parties. Support for the Labor Party slid to 22 percent from 29 percent in July, according to the monthly poll, which had a margin of sampling error of 2 to 3 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Walter Gibbs (NYT)</p>
        <p>BRITAIN: SHORT OF OFFICERS -- The government introduced an $11 million television and newspaper ad campaign as part of an effort to help recruit police officers. The number of officers is now 124,418 in England and Wales, the lowest in a decade. With key crime rates going up, the government has promised 9,000 new positions but has had trouble attracting people to the profession.</p>
        <p>Warren Hoge (NYT)</p>
        <p>NETHERLANDS: LOCKERBIE TRIAL SUSPENDED -- The Lockerbie trial was adjourned for three weeks to let American intelligence services search their archives for more information about a key witness, Abdul Majid Giaka, who was on a C.I.A. payroll at the time of the bombing. He is expected to testify that he saw the defendants place the bomb on a flight in Malta in May 1998. Mr. Giaka was supposed to testify two weeks ago, but the defense demanded complete transcripts of C.I.A. interviews with him.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: 'FRIENDLY FIRE' INQUIRY -- A preliminary army investigation concluded that the three Israeli soldiers who died in a botched raid on a West Bank home were killed by ''friendly fire.'' The investigation found that serious errors, especially the posting of undercover agents on rooftops, led to the death and injury of Israeli soldiers and to the escape of the raid's target, Mahmoud Abu Hanoud. Mr. Abu Hanoud, who is wanted in Israel on terrorism charges, is in the custody of the Palestinian authorities, who say they will prosecute him themselves.</p>
        <p>Deborah Sontag (NYT)</p>
        <p>ISRAEL, IRAQ: NUCLEAR ROW -- In a sharp exchange at the United Nations disarmament conference in Geneva, Israel and Iraq accused each other of having weapons that threaten the Middle East. Israel's delegate said Iraq ''devoted a major part of its vast income'' from oil to develop weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. Iraq's representative said Israel ''possesses hundreds of nuclear bombs, which threaten not just our region but the entire world.''</p>

        <p>IRAN: RIOTS CONTINUE -- Riots erupted for the seventh straight night in the western city of Khorramabad as demonstrators smashed bank windows and threw gasoline bombs, news organizations reported. The daily Kayhan said five people were arrested in the latest troubles, which began when two leading government critics arrived to address a pro-reform student conference.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>INDIA: PREMIER'S TRIP DELAYED -- Despite earlier assurances that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's trip to the United States would be unaffected by his poor health, his office announced he is delaying his arrival in New York by two days to Sept. 7 and canceling a visit to Silicon Valley on the advice of doctors. Mr. Vajpayee, 75, has been suffering from a flare-up of osteoarthritis in his knees.</p>

        <p>KOREAS: TALKS CONTINUE -- Negotiators from North and South Korea agreed to extend negotiations in Pyongyang until today in an effort to reach an accord to pave the way for regular talks between military officials. South Korea's minister of unification, Park Jae Kyu, pressed North Korea to agree to Seoul's proposal to open a military hot line in an effort to prevent armed clashes.</p>
        <p>Samuel Len (NYT)</p>
        <p>MYANMAR: STANDOFF CALLED PLOT -- The roadside standoff by the pro-democracy activist Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was a well-orchestrated plan to attract global attention as world leaders prepared to meet at the United Nations next week, the military government charged. Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 55, and 14 members of her opposition party are stranded outside Yangon, camping out in two vehicles and refusing to return to the capital. In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said, ''I am appalled at the actions of the Burmese regime in denying Aung San Suu Kyi the freedom to travel within her own country.''</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>SWAZILAND: JOURNALIST CLEARED -- All charges have been dropped against a journalist who was jailed last year after publishing an unflattering article about a teenage girl picked to join the king's harem. Bheki Makhubu, who has since started his own monthly newsmagazine, was fired as editor of The Sunday Times of Swaziland and charged with criminal defamation.</p>
        <p>Henri E. Cauvin (NYT)</p>
        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CUBA: U.S. TALKS RESUMING -- Ending a two-month suspension, Cuba has agreed to resume talks on legal migration of Cubans to the United States under accords signed in 1994 and '95. The agreements grant visas to 20,000 Cubans a year.</p>
