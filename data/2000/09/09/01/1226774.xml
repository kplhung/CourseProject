        <p>''I think music videos have really ruined the art of music,'' says the filmmaker and provocateur Michael Moore in a special four-part series on the Sundance Channel's ''Shorts Stop: An Hour of Short Films.'' He is talking about the crossover between video directors and movie directors.</p>
        <p>''Before you would hear the song and then you would invent your own image,'' Mr. Moore continues. ''The music video tells you this is the only way to look at this song. When you hear this song you are to think of men without shirts jumping in a field of daisies.''</p>

        <p>''I think music videos have really ruined the art of music,'' says the filmmaker and provocateur Michael Moore in a special four-part series on the Sundance Channel's ''Shorts Stop: An Hour of Short Films.'' He is talking about the crossover between video directors and movie directors.</p>
        <p>''Before you would hear the song and then you would invent your own image,'' Mr. Moore continues. ''The music video tells you this is the only way to look at this song. When you hear this song you are to think of men without shirts jumping in a field of daisies.''</p>
        <p>That pretty much describes my own feelings about music videos. Yes, I know they're important, have altered a generation's visual imagination and transformed the marketing of music -- and everything else -- since they have influenced advertising, too. But important and omnipresent doesn't mean good. McDonald's is everywhere, too. With rare exceptions video imagery always seems too literal-minded or tritely symbolic or simply vulgar. The prevailing artistic wisdom seems to be: Marginal ideas take on weight if shot in slow motion. If that doesn't work, go superfast.</p>
        <p>But I was willing to be convinced otherwise and the Sundance Channel promised illumination. This month the cable channel is presenting ''Sonic Cinema,'' films and programs intended to highlight the way movies and rock 'n' roll overlap. The seven feature documentaries about rock  performers include ''Gimme Shelter,'' the Maysles Brothers' brilliant concert film about the Rolling Stones' free -- and ultimately tragic -- concert at Altamont Speedway in December 1969. (It's also currently playing at the Film Forum.)</p>
        <p>The ''Shorts Stop'' segments, which begin this Sunday, aim to show that music videos are related to the rock documentary, at least in spirit. So these programs feature the work of independent filmmakers -- including Mr. Moore, despite his antivideo stance -- who have crossed over in both directions.</p>
        <p>The series host, Mark Anthony Thompson, talks loftily about ''the cross-pollination of music and cinema'' -- at least as lofty as a man can be slouching on a couch and wearing sunglasses (indoors) and orange flip-flops. But the series proves mainly that interesting imagery distracts from good music and can't elevate lousy music, and that annoying pictures can actually prove deafening. You simply tune out.</p>
        <p>The best work in the series comes, not surprisingly, from Spike Jonze, who sprang exuberantly from the video world into film, with the inventive ''Being John Malkovich'' (and more recently into the world of politics, with his biographical documentary of Al Gore for the Democratic convention). His ''Oh So Quiet'' music video for the Icelandic pop star Bjork, set in a Goodyear tire store, is an extravagantly produced homage to Hollywood musicals of the 1930's. Bjork gleefully high-kicks and prances in an orange dress, looking happy to be in this bright, amusing little spectacle, where the music and pictures actually seem to have something to do with one another (even if they don't).</p>
        <p>Another film director, Hal Hartley, has created an amusing mock concert for the English folk singer Beth Orton's ''Stolen Car.'' While singing, Ms. Orton slyly assumes ''meaningful'' poses in various corners of a room, flops on a couch and pretends not to notice the expressionless assistants sticking microphones in front of her mouth. She pricks her finger with the thorn of a rose and a drop of her blood lazily drifts through a glass of water. Mr. Hartley has artfully staged the video in grays and reds, but I'd still rather listen to Ms. Orton's lovely voice with my eyes closed.</p>
        <p>As for the pugnacious Mr. Moore, director (of ''Roger and Me'') and television crusader (on ''The Awful Truth'' and ''TV Nation''), he paired up with a band that could have been named just for him, Rage Against the Machine. Mr. Moore has styled his video as just another of his impromptu assaults -- this one on the New York Stock Exchange. As Rage wails outside the exchange, the police arrive. Mr. Moore confronts. The action is intercut with a parody of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' No daisy fields, that's for sure.</p>
        <p>The rest of the opening night program is video as usual. Harmony Korine, directing ''Sunday'' by Sonic Youth, meets the expectations set in 1997 by ''Gummo,'' his feature film debut, which Janet Maslin in The New York Times pronounced ''the worst film of the year.''</p>
        <p>Later episodes in the ''Sonic Cinema'' series contain some arresting imagery of Patti Smith's edges, in a video filmed by Melodie McDaniel, a talented fashion photographer. There is sweet candor from Mike Mills, a graphic artist and entrepreneur who began shooting videos only after he had designed record jackets. ''I can treat it all like an integrated package,'' he says.</p>
        <p>The series also offers Richard Kern, described (accurately) by the host, Mr. Thompson, ''as a downtown, fetishist photographer filmmaker who deals with a lot of images of bondage and violence.'' By the end, I'd learned this: three minutes can be a very long time.</p>
        <p>SONIC CINEMA  Sundance Channel, Sunday at 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>Adam Pincus, executive producer; John Bedolis, director and supervising producer; Marge Doherty, segment producer; Frank Floyd, editor; Doron Schlair, director of photography. Marc Anthony Thompson, host.</p>
