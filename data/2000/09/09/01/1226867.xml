        <p>A half-dozen companies had submitted bids to take over the World Trade Center under a 99-year lease by the end of the day yesterday, the deadline for proposals, according to people involved in the bidding process.</p>
        <p>Officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center, would not disclose who had made bids to take the buildings private or the value of the proposals. But others involved in the process said that six firms had bid and that the top bid would give the authority net revenue of about $2.5 billion over the life of the lease.</p>
        <p>When the privatization proposal was approved in 1998, it was estimated that the agency would realize $1.5 billion, and as recently as three months ago, that estimate had risen to $2 billion.</p>
        <p>The six companies emerged from a group of 30 large real estate development firms that were considered capable of handling a deal of this size and were provided three months ago with the data they needed to make preliminary bids.</p>
        <p>Those six companies will be further pared by the end of the month to a ''short list'' of companies that will be given access to more detailed leasing, operating and other financial information, said Cherrie L. Nanninga, director of real estate for the Port Authority.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nanninga has said that there will then be a period for the companies to examine the deal more closely, followed by negotiations with one of them aimed at fully privatizing the 16-acre, 10-million-square-foot complex by next year.</p>
        <p>Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority board,  predicted earlier in the day that there would be ''four of five'' proposals and pronounced that response ''a successful number given the magnitude of project.''</p>
        <p>The idea of taking one of the city's trademark pieces of real estate private has been around for some time. It had been vigorously championed by Gov. George E. Pataki and New York's representatives on the Port Authority board, and merely acceded to by New Jersey representatives, when unanimously approved in September 1998.</p>
        <p>But progress on the plan was delayed for nearly 18 months while Mr. Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey argued over allocation of the agency's resources and the kinds of projects it should finance.</p>
        <p>That dispute was resolved in May, unleashing millions of dollars in projects favored by both states and clearing the way for the World Trade Center proposal to go out to a group of undisclosed bidders in June.</p>
        <p>According to people involved in the process, the companies that were invited to submit proposals last June included Donald J. Trump's organization, as well as Tishman Speyer, Gale &amp; Wentworth, Mortimer Zuckerman's Boston Properties, the Rouse Company and the Canadian firm Brookfield Properties.</p>
        <p>The deal could potentially be split between a company skilled in leasing and managing the office space and another more experienced in retail. The 430,000-square-foot retail component of the trade center includes 74 stores.</p>
        <p>One critical feature of any deal would be the end of the arrangement under which the Port Authority pays New York City $27.5 million a year in lieu of real estate taxes on the trade center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gargano said that any bidders would have to be aware of his position -- and that of others on the authority's board -- that the successful bidder would have to pay city taxes, which are estimated at $100 million a year, or negotiate a deal with the city.</p>
        <p>City officials have said in the past that they would accept nothing short of the full real estate taxes on the property.</p>
