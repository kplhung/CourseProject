        <p>With ''Cats'' scheduled to close on Sept. 10 after 18 years on Broadway, next week is sure to bring nostalgia for the days when Eliotian whiskers were new, when the actress BETTY BUCKLEY believed that ''Cats'' really would be now and forever, when she was on stage every night as Grizabella and had the dressing room Barbra Streisand had had for ''Funny Girl.''</p>

        <p>'Cats,' Now And Until Sept. 10</p>
        <p>With ''Cats'' scheduled to close on Sept. 10 after 18 years on Broadway, next week is sure to bring nostalgia for the days when Eliotian whiskers were new, when the actress BETTY BUCKLEY believed that ''Cats'' really would be now and forever, when she was on stage every night as Grizabella and had the dressing room Barbra Streisand had had for ''Funny Girl.''</p>
        <p>Forget about next week: she started reminiscing yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I think she had the whole suite,'' Ms. Buckley said, referring to Ms. Streisand and the dressing room, ''but when we were there, one room went to Ken Page, and I had one room. But I got the one with the bathtub.''</p>
        <p>This was followed by memories of how she got the part in which she sang ''Memory.'' After her audition, ''the word went back to my agent that they thought I radiated health and well-being and they wanted somebody who radiated death and dying.''</p>
        <p>It was months before she was called back for a second audition.</p>
        <p>''TREVOR NUNN made me sing 'Memory' three times, and each time it was more suicidal, more suicidal, more suicidal,'' she said. ''I said, 'Mr. Nunn, surely by this point you've auditioned the entire talent pool here in the United States and you've seen a lot of women who can do this part as well as I can do it, but there's nobody who can do it better.' He seemed kind of amazed that I would speak to him.''</p>
        <p>She got the part that day.</p>
        <p>Now she is scheduled to sing ''Memory'' in ''Broadway on Broadway,'' an annual concert in Times Square, on Sept. 10, the day ''Cats'' closes. Is she downcast?</p>
        <p>''I'm excited,'' she said. ''It's not a song to me anymore. It's like my favorite recurring dream.''</p>
        <p>One Diagnosis, In the Strike Zone</p>
        <p>MARCIA STEIN, the executive director of Citymeals-on-Wheels, says that the Mets left-hander AL LEITER is a good diagnostician. And she is not talking about figuring out when to throw a fastball.</p>
        <p>One day last month, Ms. Stein went to Shea Stadium to be photographed with Mr. Leiter. She rode onto the field in a van because her leg had been hurting for several weeks and she had been limping. Her doctor had sent her to a rheumatologist. There was a suspicion the problem was arthritis, she said.</p>
        <p>''I stuck my hand out and said, 'Hi, I'm Marcia Stein.' He said, 'How come you're walking like that? Do you have a torn meniscus?' '' (The meniscus is a cartilage in the knee.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Stein had more tests, and the diagnosis was two torn meniscuses. ''I never knew the knee had one, let alone two,'' she said, ''but he diagnosed it from the way I was walking. He even bent over. He poked it in the front, he poked it on the side. I said, what happens when you have a torn meniscus? He said, 'It's just some surgery,' and walked away.''</p>
        <p>Film Frenzy</p>
        <p>It was a pep rally for the pep-rally movie. How else to explain why cheerleaders were jumping and turning cartwheels in the lobby of the AMC Empire Theater on West 42nd Street? The cheerleaders, from Newtown High School in Elmhurst, Queens, were spelling out the name ''J-E-S-S-E'' as JESSE BRADFORD, one of the stars of the sleeper ''Bring It On,'' arrived for a screening.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradford is beginning his senior year at Columbia University, majoring in -- what else? -- film. He has three films scheduled to be released between now and graduation, if he stays in school that long -- he said he would leave ''if a good enough offer comes up.''</p>
        <p>He signed autographs for a couple of hours, even saying hello to a fan on a cell phone. He had trouble with some of the spellings: ''Is that Mary with a Y?'' he asked, and that was before a Fuschia and a Siobhan presented themselves. But he did not stick around for the screening. ''I don't like watching myself enough to see it again.''</p>
