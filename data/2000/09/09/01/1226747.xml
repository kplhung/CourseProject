        <p>The promise of modern painting, so the old story went, was fulfilled with the achievement of complete abstraction. Representational imagery dissolved into the aesthetic nirvana of the unified, allover field.</p>
        <p>Many artists refused to join the church of formalist purity, however, and continued to paint representational pictures, even pictures of the most retrograde subject of all, the human figure. Yet many of those who did so still thought they were, as Ezra Pound urged, making it new, and the human body remains one of the most compelling objects of attention and desire for contemporary painters.</p>
        <p>''The Figure: Another Side of Modernism,'' a vast, enthralling grab bag of an exhibition at the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art on Staten Island, invites us to count the ways that modern artists have painted the human figure over the last 50 years. Selected by Lily Wei, a critic and curator, works by 125 painters populate the center's warren of scruffy galleries, creating a relentlessly absorbing visual experience.</p>
        <p>The show is hung in roughly chronological order with thematic groupings devoted to subjects like the nude, cartoons and sexual politics. Although it includes most of the usual suspects, from Willem de Kooning and Fairfield Porter to John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage, and touches on significant movements from Pop to Chicago Imagism to Bad Painting, you could not call it a definitive history of post-World War II figurative painting. It is oriented mainly to the 90's, and artists like Chuck Close and Roy Lichtenstein are not necessarily represented by works from their most groundbreaking periods.</p>
        <p>Many of the show's best works are by lesser-known names. Nor does the show put forth a particular thesis or ideological agenda. It feels loosely provisional, leaving it to viewers to make sense of it all.</p>
        <p>Not knowing quite what to expect from room to room is a large part of the fun. A big diptych from 1980 by David Salle -- smudgy, academic nudes on monochrome fields -- hanging near a recent broken-plate painting by Julian Schnabel is predictable. But a huge 1963 picture of primordial titans by Leon Golub hanging across from an equally huge grisaille from 1967 by Alfred Leslie -- a towering, alarmingly lighted nude giantess -- tells a story about the 1960's refreshingly different from the usual Pop-Color Field-Minimalism textbook history.</p>
        <p>One expects to find something by de Kooning, who famously broke faith with pure abstraction in the early 50's. But who would have expected this exquisite little gem of a drawing from the late 40's: a ferocious, big-eyed pink woman in a green scoop-neck dress emerging from a welter of whiplash lines? And who would have thought Philip Pearlstein would look so good with his remorselessly clinical, dryly sensuous ''Nude on Kilim Rug'' from 1969?</p>
        <p>The show is full of witty and suggestive juxtapositions; it looks as if the organizers had fun with the installation. In the corner of a small upstairs room one encounters a magical meeting of recent paintings by Catherine Murphy and John Wesley. Hers is an intensely realistic picture of the bottoms of a man's greatly enlarged feet on a striped mattress; his, a cartoon sofa with a dreamy odalisque inscribed on its upright cushions. As different as they are superficially, both share an exacting care for composition, a subtly surrealistic mood and an amusingly similar, primarily pink palette.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, in a room full of nudes, there is the mischievous placement of Mr. Currin's picture of three oddly distorted Renaissance-style beauties directly across from one of William Bailey's high-mindedly prurient fantasies of a naked young woman in a bare room. Mr. Currin's antic perversity seems to be teasing Mr. Bailey's solemnity.</p>
        <p>But what is most gratifying is simply that the show is so full of interesting, inventive and richly made paintings. There are dull spots and duds aplenty, to be sure. The Conceptualist works of Mike Bidlo (a copy of a famous Cubist nude by Picasso) and Byron Kim (a grid of panels painted with different commercially prepared ''flesh'' colors) may deserve a place, but the cerebral cleverness is annoying. And many noted artists, like Francesco Clemente, Mark Tansey and Eric Fischl, are represented by minor works.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Wei obviously had a lot of obligatory bases to cover, and she has done so with an admirably open mind and eye. How many painting shows will you see that include the neo-conservative hero Leland Bell, the morbid professional outsider Ivan Albright and the trendy young media doll Cecily Brown?</p>
        <p>From a distance one may begin to discern deeper tensions underlying the pluralist, crazy-quilt surface of the show. Tradition and avant-gardism; formalism and fantasy; perceptual reality and mediated reality; the sacred and the profane: all the contradictions of modern life are embodied here. Differently ordered and labeled, this show might have done more to highlight and clarify such themes, but maybe it is enough simply to have gathered such an abundantly suggestive collection of pictures.</p>
        <p>With too many worthwhile works to mention here, a short list would include, at least, Dottie Attie's slyly understated meditation on rape, Stuart Diamond's comical Cubist heads, Elliot Green's fusion of grid painting and rubbery cartoon people, Dennis Kardon's oversize head of a boy pondering a bit of goo, Alex Katz's radiant portrait of his wife, an intensely observant portrait of a woman by Joseph Santore, the strange meeting of a satyr and a falling horse by David True and Robert Colescott's bumptious, comically tragic allegory of race and racism.</p>
        <p>''The Figure: Another Side of Modernism'' will remain at the Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art at Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Staten Island, (718) 448-2500, through Jan. 14.</p>
