        <p>The California Children and Families Commission is beginning a review to find its first agency of record to handle its educational advertising campaign focused on early childhood development and the effects of tobacco use by pregnant women and parents of young children.</p>
        <p>Billings were estimated at $90 million for a three-year contract.</p>
        <p>Kristina Parham, a spokeswoman at the commission in Sacramento, Calif., confirmed a report of the review that was carried in the online edition of Adweek. The account had been handled on a project basis by Asher/Gal &amp; Partners in Los Angeles and Runyon Saltzman &amp; Einhorn in Sacramento.</p>
        <p>A decision is expected in December; the contract will begin on Jan. 1, 2001.</p>
        <p>The commission was created as a result of a 1998 initiative started by the actor Rob Reiner that imposed a 50-cent tax on every pack of cigarettes sold in California; the tax generates about $700 million a year.</p>
