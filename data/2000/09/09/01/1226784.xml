        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I can assure Mary R. Lefkowitz (''No Words Capture the Fear,'' Op-Ed, Aug. 26) that not all passengers on endangered planes are ''uncannily calm.''</p>
        <p>A decade ago, after an uneventful flight from San Francisco to New York, the plane I was on tried to land in a powerful thunderstorm. The wind shear was severe, and the plane repeatedly plunged with no warning. The left wing was struck by a bolt of lightning that left an eerie blue aura, and the pilot failed in his first three attempts to land. By the time he lined up for the fourth attempt, at least half the passengers were screaming, weeping or praying.</p>
        <p>After we finally did land successfully, I overheard one of the flight crew say it was the worst he had ever experienced. I would bet that the naked and very vocal terror inside that cabin is far from uncommon when helpless passengers are surprised by a confrontation with eternity.</p>
        <p>DAVID HAYDEN  Wilton, Conn., Aug. 26, 2000</p>
