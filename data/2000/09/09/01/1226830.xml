        <p>The troubled Roosevelt school district, which is facing a state ultimatum to improve its junior high and high school or risk their closure, suffered another blow Wednesday night when its interim superintendent resigned less than two weeks before the opening of school.</p>
        <p>Fadhilika Atiba-Weza served only two months as Roosevelt's interim schools leader before becoming the fourth superintendent to quit in the five years since the State Education Department intervened in the district. Roosevelt's junior and senior high schools have been among the state's worst performers, and in 1995 the department removed the school board and appointed an oversight panel that advises a reconstituted board on academic and business affairs.</p>
        <p>The board appointed Horace Williams interim superintendent, effective Friday. Last year, Mr. Williams served as the principal of Lincoln High School in Yonkers, itself on the state's list of low-performing schools.</p>
        <p>In an interview after a marathon meeting that stretched past midnight Wednesday, Mr. Atiba-Weza said he was taking a job as an assistant superintendent in the Central Islip district in Suffolk County. But he added that he had sought another job because of ''too much interference'' from the Roosevelt board, which he said ''is not listening to my recommendations.''</p>
        <p>Mark Davis, president of the board, disagreed, saying that Wednesday night the board approved more than two dozen appointments of teachers and other staff members recommended by Mr. Atiba-Weza.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said he believed the change in superintendents would not affect the district's attempt to improve the performance of its junior high and high school students this year.</p>
        <p>Last year, only 5 of Roosevelt's 100 graduating seniors earned the challenging Regents diplomas, and more than 80 percent of its eighth graders failed to meet state standards on math and English exams.</p>
        <p>School and board officials also said at the meeting that the district had had a growing number of resignations from teachers and support staff in the six weeks since the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, threatened to close the district's junior and senior high school if student performance did not improve this year.</p>
        <p>The board has taken some steps ordered by the commissioner, including the appointment of math and English department chairmen in the high school and the hiring of a middle school principal. But some school officials also said they were not getting adequate support from the state, whose five-member oversight panel, appointed to help manage the district, has dwindled to two active members, one of whom is expected to resign in September.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills, in an interview, said he planned to make further appointments to the oversight board in the coming weeks. He also said the district had received much help from Education Department officials preparing them for the upcoming school year. In September, Mr. Mills is scheduled to specify performance goals that the junior and senior high school students must meet if the district is to avoid having those schools closed.</p>
        <p>At Wednesday's meeting, several of the 40 community residents in attendance rebuked board members during the public discussion period for failing to focus on educational issues.</p>
        <p>''All they want to talk about is money,'' said Sandra Macer, who added that she intended to move out of the district. ''No one at these meetings likes to discuss education.''</p>
        <p>During the meeting, which lasted 4 hours and 20 minutes, the school board discussed and voted on more than three dozen items, including individual teacher contracts, whether to grant maternity leave to certain district employees, and even the price of milk for the school cafeteria.</p>
        <p>But the only item on the agenda dealing with curriculum and instruction, a report on professional development activities for school administrators and teachers, was put off until a future meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, the board president, said the process of reviewing individual contracts and appointments was necessary in a district that is operating on a contingency budget and that has been ordered by the commissioner to fill certain administrative positions by the start of the school year on Sept. 11, a deadline he said the board would meet.</p>
