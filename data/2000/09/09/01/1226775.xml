        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>ANTI-POP CONSORTIUM, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, at 11th Street, East Village, (212) 420-8392. The ambitious underground hip-hop of the Anti-Pop Consortium arrives in a flood of polysyllables. Over the laconic, dislocated beats of E. Blaize, the rappers Priest, Beans and M. Sayyid wrap stories and self-promotion in similes and allusions so fast and densely packed they could use an instant replay. Tonight at 10; admission is $10 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>MARCIA BALL, B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. The statuesque queen of the boogie-woogie blues piano takes her rollicking barrelhouse music to this swank new supper club. It's always fun to see Ms. Ball wield her considerable keyboard talents and Louisiana-meets-Texas charm. Don't miss the opening band, the excellent Little Charlie and the Nightcats from Oakland, Calif. Tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $30 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>* CLARENCE GATEMOUTH BROWN, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Clarence  Gatemouth Brown may be the quintessential Gulf Coast musician. Born in Louisiana and reared in Texas, he soaked up music from the Delta to the bayou to the panhandle, and in his repertory, nothing separates the blues from country or jazz or Cajun music. Whether singing, playing blues guitar solos that jab and moan or reaching for the untamed cry of a Creole fiddle, he's an American master. Tonight at 8 and 10:30; admission is $25 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>CHICK COREA, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. It's the end of a week of solo performances from Mr. Corea, one of the most virtuosic players in jazz, with a minutely calibrated touch and a strong sense of rhythm. He's been exploring the form lately, having released two solo-piano records a few months ago on his own label, Stretch. Sets are at 9 and 11:30 tonight through Sunday night; cover charge is $45 at the tables, $30 at the bar; $5 minimum at the tables, one-drink minimum at the bar (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* KEVIN COYNE, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055; Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, at 11th Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Kevin Coyne may be the only blues singer who paints in the Expressionist style, publishes books about Elvis and teddy bears, once worked as a therapist for the severely disturbed and releases albums with titles like ''Sugar Candy Taxi.'' And he almost got Jim Morrison's job in the Doors! It is a privilege to see this English eccentric free-associate. He doesn't come to New York that often, so don't miss these shows; you won't see another like them this year. Tonight at 8 at the Knitting Factory; admission is $10. Sunday night at 8 at Maxwell's; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>ELVIS CRESPO, GEORGE LAMOND, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Clinton, (212) 582-2672. With his shoulder-length hair and his baby face, Elvis Crespo is a pop pinup across Latin America. Born in New York and reared in Puerto Rico, he passed through the Latin kiddie-pop institution Menudo (like Ricky Martin) and went on to join another pop outfit, Grupomania. Then he hopped islands for his preferred style: merengue, which comes from the Dominican Republic, though he still sings a few ballads and salsa tunes. He shares the bill with a more gifted vocalist, George Lamond, who (like Marc Anthony) rediscovered salsa after getting his start in dance music. Tonight about 10; admission is $10 before 10, $20 after, or $30 with a reserved table seat (Pareles).</p>
        <p>ENON, STARLIGHT MINTS, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, at 11th Street, East Village, (212) 420-8392. Some bands rock; others lurch and sway and crunch. Enon includes Brainiac's guitarist and a rhythm section from Skeleton Key; its songs are utterly polymorphous, veering from clattering minimal syncopations to melodic rock, but never shying away from noise. Starlight Mints, from Norman, Okla., places Allan Vest's smart-alecky surrealism over a bare-bones framework of simple drumbeats and garage-rock guitar chords. In various songs from its new album, ''The Dream That Stuff Was Made Of,'' the band suggests the B-52's, David Bowie, the Fall or the Standells, but never for very long. Starlight Mints performs tomorrow night at 10:30., followed by Enon at 11:30; admission is $8. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>EL GRAN COMBO, JOHNNY PACHECO, Copacabana, 617 West 57th Street, Midtown, (212) 582-2672. Formed in 1962 and on the Latin charts consistently ever since, El Gran Combo has (along with Sonora Poncena) become one of Puerto Rico's definitive salsa bands, pitching eager romance amid hard-driving percussion and horns. It trades sets with the flutist and band leader Johnny Pacheco. Mr. Pacheco was born in the Dominican Republic but fell in love early with Afro-Cuban music. He has been a prime mover in New York Latin music since the 1960's, when he helped start Fania Records. He went on to lead the Fania All-Stars, the band that defined New York salsa. Tomorrow night at 11; admission is $15 before 11, $25 after, or $35 for a reserved table seat (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SONNY FORTUNE QUARTET, Jazz Standard 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Fortune, a saxophonist, plays hard, having first made his name breaking through the heavy crust of Miles Davis's early-70's electric bands. He can still bruise a stage with his energy, playing a straight-ahead jazz set. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a $25 cover charge, $10 minimum ($18 cover, $10 minimum for the midnight sets); Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with an $18 cover and $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>CHARLIE HUNTER, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. The guitarist Charlie Hunter plays breezy funk and soul-jazz, keeping the bass lines bubbling while he simultaneously improvises melodically on his eight-string. Some of his music has been better suited for the dance floor than a sit-down place, so this one-nighter at the Bowery seems right for him. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $15; $12 in advance (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MAGIC SLIM AND THE TEARDROPS, Chicago Blues, 73 Eighth Avenue, below 14th Street, West Village (212) 924-9755. Morris Holt, a k a Magic Slim, followed the classic Chicago blues trajectory: born in Mississippi in 1937, he went to Chicago in his teens and worked his way up to being a mainstay of the South Side club circuit, playing hard-luck blues with guitar solos that poke and jab over his band's lean, assertive vamps. Tonight at 9:30, 11 and 12:30; admission is $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>NEW ART JAZZ QUARTET, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. In its moment, 20 years ago, James Blood Ulmer's unorthodox jazz-guitar playing hit New York music like a meteor. Rock and jazz both claimed him; his bright, slashing chords and figurations dovetailed so well with all the post-Ornette, pre-Medeski Martin and Wood, punk-funk-free-form styles of the day that his beautiful and somewhat narrow style was spread too thin. Mr. Ulmer has maintained his career well, playing in re-formed versions of several old bands, as well as forming this new, standard jazz quartet, with the pianist John Hicks, the bassist Reggie Workman and the drummer Rashied Ali. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow night. Cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow, $17.50 on Sunday; with a $10 minimum all times. (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>NICKELODEON ALL THAT MUSIC AND MORE FESTIVAL, Jones Beach Theater, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. It's hardly novel now to see very small people going crazy over pop; what grown-up hasn't indulged in a sick-day viewing of MTV's ''Total Request Live''? So this festival, the first directed at the prepubescent set, is now a barometer rather than a herald. This year the curious can see if LFO has anything beyond its hit, ''Summer Girls,'' whether the Irish Spice Girls of Bewitched can ever make it in America, and if the A-Teens, a band that covers Abba songs, can bring the Swedish noise to a new generation. Also performing: I5, My Town, Boyz N Girlz United, Leslie Carter (sister to the established teen idols Nick and Aaron), Nick Cannon, R-Angels, and Plus-1. Today at 5 p.m.; tickets are $15 to $35 (Powers).</p>
        <p>OGANS, S.O.B's, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Salvador, the capital of Bahia, Brazil, is a cornucopia of buoyant rhythms and irresistible pop tunes. Ogans, a band of booming drummers backing a singer, plays a repertory of Bahian hits that incorporates both the sophisticated tunes of tropicalia and the frenetic, lightheartedly raunchy songs of Bahia's more recent craze, axe. The band's Brazilian fans show up in force to dance and sing along. Tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 1; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>BABATUNDE OLATUNJI, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Babatunde Olatunji, from Nigeria, introduced many American listeners to West African rhythms with his album ''Drums of Passion.'' He has since become a kind of cultural ambassador, as well as a dedicated teacher, of African music. To celebrate his 50th year of performing, he has assembled a pan-African group of colleagues: the singer Dorothy Masuka from South Africa, the Moroccan singer and sintir (plucked lute) player Hassan Hakmoun, the Senegalese sabar drummer Lama Bouna Basse, the Nigerian talking-drum player Sikiru Adepoju and Roslyn Burrough, who sings African-American spirituals. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $45 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>THE PACIFIC OCEAN, GREEN 4, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, and Rivington, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Connie Lovatt and Ed Baluyut of the Pacific Ocean play pensive tunes with a little guitar noise thrown in, for listeners who like their rock introspective. But the really intriguing band on this bill is the opener, a new project for the daring Mary Timony of Helium. Joined by two female friends, wielding a drum machine, Ms. Timony promises music about bats and birds, for dancing. Sounds excellent! Sunday night at 8; admission is $8. (Powers).</p>
        <p>* PANORAMA, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 774-8807, (718) 773-4052 or (718) 625-1515. Before marching in Monday's carnival in Brooklyn, steel-drum (or pan) bands from Brooklyn and the Caribbean unveil their repertories while staying stationary, allowing listeners to savor full-length performances with pealing harmonies and carnival rhythms. In a concert and competition that stretches into the wee hours, a dozen bands each play half-hour sets while judges deliberate. If it's not the world's most jubilant music, it's a definite contender. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $25 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>PRIMAL BLUE, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. An ad-hoc grouping of some of good straight-ahead jazz musicians: the contemplative tenor saxophonist Javon Jackson, known by his own Blue Note albums, and the rhythm section consisting of Lenny White, Dave Kikoski and Ed Howard, known for their affiliation with dozens of bands around New York. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25, plus a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* SOCA FESTIVALS, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 774-8807, (718) 773-4052 or (718) 625-1515. As a warmup to the Brooklyn West Indian-American carnival parade on Labor Day, which starts on Monday at 10:30 a.m. at Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway, the leading soca stars of the English-speaking Caribbean perform outdoors next to the Brooklyn Museum. Through the 1990's, soca absorbed ideas from reggae, rock and hip-hop, not to mention music videos. Yet between the admonitions to ''jump up'' and ''grind it,'' there's still likely to be plenty of political advice, history and earthy humor. The major carnival concerts start tonight with a show of four ebullient soca bands. On recordings crisp electronic beats often carry new soca songs, but live musicians still propel the high-speed party music onstage; the groups are billed as brass bands. Two video-ready bands, Machel Montano and X-Tatik, and Alison Hinds and Square One, share the bill with Charlie's Roots, the Brooklyn soca band that visiting soca stars often choose for their backup group, and the Blue Ventures. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25. The rhyming, dancing commentators of soca show up on Sunday night at 8, with many past and present carnival kings including the Mighty Sparrow, whose sense of humor and articulate rhymes have made him the most influential calypso songwriter since World War II, and David Rudder, who draws on ancient Afro-Trinidadian drumming along with touches of reggae, along with Sugar Aloes, Red Plastic Bag, King Smarty and Pink Panther; tickets are $25. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JACKY TERRASSON TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Terrasson, a pianist in his mid-30's, is one of the greatest gifts of his generation to jazz: rhythmically intensive, dramatic, given to long jams with extreme dynamics. The worst thing that can be said about him is that his strings of fizzy little ideas don't cohere; at his best, though, he can floor you. In this quartet he is reunited with the less-is-more-style drummer Leon Parker, one of his best accomplices. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30, and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow night; cover, $20 tonight and tomorrow, $15 on Sunday; $10 minimum all days (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>DWIGHT YOAKAM, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800. Dwight Yoakam is a honky-tonk die-hard, holding on to the Bakersfield country tradition of Buck Owens as he moans about the women who have broken his heart or done him wrong. His lyrics, which he recently published in book form, are models of concise storytelling; his songs find endless variations on classic honky-tonk forms, sometimes letting in a hint of folk-rock or Phil Spector. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37.50 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JOHN ZORN'S MASADA, MASADA STRING TRIO, BAR KOKHBA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Zorn sets up his bands like formulas, and with these three he consistently gives his fans what they want. With echoes of Jewish music and energy jazz of the 60's, the quartet Masada is the hottest band in Mr. Zorn's arsenal. Masada String Trio boils down those tunes to elegant chamber music, and Bar Kokhba makes them over again for an expanded chamber ensemble. Tomorrow night at 8 and 11; tickets are $30 (Ratliff).</p>

        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>ANTI-POP CONSORTIUM, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, at 11th Street, East Village, (212) 420-8392. The ambitious underground hip-hop of the Anti-Pop Consortium arrives in a flood of polysyllables. Over the laconic, dislocated beats of E. Blaize, the rappers Priest, Beans and M. Sayyid wrap stories and self-promotion in similes and allusions so fast and densely packed they could use an instant replay. Tonight at 10; admission is $10 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>MARCIA BALL, B. B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144.

To celebrate his 50th year of performing, he has assembled a pan-African group of colleagues: the singer Dorothy Masuka from South Africa, the Moroccan singer and sintir (plucked lute) player Hassan Hakmoun, the Senegalese sabar drummer Lama Bouna Basse, the Nigerian talking-drum player Sikiru Adepoju and Roslyn Burrough, who sings African-American spirituals. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $45 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>THE PACIFIC OCEAN, GREEN 4, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, and Rivington, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Connie Lovatt and Ed Baluyut of the Pacific Ocean play pensive tunes with a little guitar noise thrown in, for listeners who like their rock introspective. But the really intriguing band on this bill is the opener, a new project for the daring Mary Timony of Helium. Joined by two female friends, wielding a drum machine, Ms. Timony promises music about bats and birds, for dancing. Sounds excellent! Sunday night at 8; admission is $8. (Powers).</p>
        <p>* PANORAMA, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 774-8807, (718) 773-4052 or (718) 625-1515. Before marching in Monday's carnival in Brooklyn, steel-drum (or pan) bands from Brooklyn and the Caribbean unveil their repertories while staying stationary, allowing listeners to savor full-length performances with pealing harmonies and carnival rhythms. In a concert and competition that stretches into the wee hours, a dozen bands each play half-hour sets while judges deliberate. If it's not the world's most jubilant music, it's a definite contender. Tomorrow night at 8; admission is $25 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>PRIMAL BLUE, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-3080. An ad-hoc grouping of some of good straight-ahead jazz musicians: the contemplative tenor saxophonist Javon Jackson, known by his own Blue Note albums, and the rhythm section consisting of Lenny White, Dave Kikoski and Ed Howard, known for their affiliation with dozens of bands around New York. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25, plus a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* SOCA FESTIVALS, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 774-8807, (718) 773-4052 or (718) 625-1515. As a warmup to the Brooklyn West Indian-American carnival parade on Labor Day, which starts on Monday at 10:30 a.m. at Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway, the leading soca stars of the English-speaking Caribbean perform outdoors next to the Brooklyn Museum. Through the 1990's, soca absorbed ideas from reggae, rock and hip-hop, not to mention music videos. Yet between the admonitions to ''jump up'' and ''grind it,'' there's still likely to be plenty of political advice, history and earthy humor. The major carnival concerts start tonight with a show of four ebullient soca bands. On recordings crisp electronic beats often carry new soca songs, but live musicians still propel the high-speed party music onstage; the groups are billed as brass bands. Two video-ready bands, Machel Montano and X-Tatik, and Alison Hinds and Square One, share the bill with Charlie's Roots, the Brooklyn soca band that visiting soca stars often choose for their backup group, and the Blue Ventures. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25. The rhyming, dancing commentators of soca show up on Sunday night at 8, with many past and present carnival kings including the Mighty Sparrow, whose sense of humor and articulate rhymes have made him the most influential calypso songwriter since World War II, and David Rudder, who draws on ancient Afro-Trinidadian drumming along with touches of reggae, along with Sugar Aloes, Red Plastic Bag, King Smarty and Pink Panther; tickets are $25.

        <p>* JACKY TERRASSON TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. Terrasson, a pianist in his mid-30's, is one of the greatest gifts of his generation to jazz: rhythmically intensive, dramatic, given to long jams with extreme dynamics. The worst thing that can be said about him is that his strings of fizzy little ideas don't cohere; at his best, though, he can floor you. In this quartet he is reunited with the less-is-more-style drummer Leon Parker, one of his best accomplices. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30, and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow night; cover, $20 tonight and tomorrow, $15 on Sunday; $10 minimum all days (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>DWIGHT YOAKAM, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800. Dwight Yoakam is a honky-tonk die-hard, holding on to the Bakersfield country tradition of Buck Owens as he moans about the women who have broken his heart or done him wrong. His lyrics, which he recently published in book form, are models of concise storytelling; his songs find endless variations on classic honky-tonk forms, sometimes letting in a hint of folk-rock or Phil Spector. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37.50 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JOHN ZORN'S MASADA, MASADA STRING TRIO, BAR KOKHBA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Zorn sets up his bands like formulas, and with these three he consistently gives his fans what they want. With echoes of Jewish music and energy jazz of the 60's, the quartet Masada is the hottest band in Mr. Zorn's arsenal. Masada String Trio boils down those tunes to elegant chamber music, and Bar Kokhba makes them over again for an expanded chamber ensemble. Tomorrow night at 8 and 11; tickets are $30 (Ratliff).</p>
