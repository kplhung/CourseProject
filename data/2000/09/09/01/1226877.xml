        <p>As a newly certified math teacher, Melanie Walker assumed that she would have no problem getting a job close to her new home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. John F. Kennedy High School, in nearby Marble Hill, needs math teachers like her.</p>
        <p>But a court order issued last week compels the Board of Education to assign all newly hired certified teachers to the city's 94 lowest-performing schools until about 400 vacancies there are filled. So when Ms. Walker applied for a job on Wednesday at Kennedy, which has not been classified as a failing school, she was turned away.</p>
        <p>''This is just ridiculous,'' Ms. Walker, 26, said yesterday after scrambling to find a failing school within commuting distance of Riverdale, where she and her husband are buying an apartment. ''I want to be able to make the best decisions for my family, and this makes it impossible.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Walker is among dozens of new certified teachers whose job searches have been thrown into chaos by the court order, which is the result of a lawsuit filed against the Board of Education by Richard P. Mills, the state education commissioner. In a paradox, they have found that having certification is a barrier to getting into a school of their choice and that being uncertified would have made their search easier.</p>
        <p>Rather than work in a failing school, some are choosing to seek jobs outside the city. Others, like Ms. Walker, are grudgingly resigning themselves to longer commutes and to jobs at troubled schools they fear will be exhausting and depressing.</p>
        <p>By late yesterday, Board of Education officials said they had filled all of the roughly 100 vacancies in the lowest-performing elementary schools. But dozens of job openings still exist in the lowest-performing middle and high schools, they said.</p>
        <p>Marie DeCanio, deputy executive director of the board's Division of Human Resources, said schools that were not on the state's list of failing schools would not be allowed to hire certified teachers at least through next week. ''We have to ensure that certified teachers who have accepted assignments actually report for service next week,'' she said. ''Until then, these rules remain in place.''</p>
        <p>That news infuriated one new teacher who had hoped to land a job in Community School District 29, which covers a largely middle-class area in southeast Queens. She said she was turned away from a job fair in Queens on Wednesday because she was certified, a reversal of how hiring normally works. She said she would never work in a failing school, because most are in neighborhoods that she considers dangerous and because the demands are overwhelming.</p>
        <p>''You have to be a combination of a social worker and Mother Teresa to work in those schools,'' she said.  ''Those kids deserve a decent education, but we as teachers deserve a decent work atmosphere. We deserve to be safe. I worked so hard to get my license, I did all this schooling, and the last thing I heard, America was a country of free choice.''</p>
        <p>At another crowded job fair at the Marriott Hotel in Brooklyn on Wednesday, many applicants said they were frustrated that they would not be able to work in districts that were close to home or to their graduate schools. Many districts in Queens and Manhattan have only a few vacancies in troubled schools, so most teachers who had their hearts set on working in those boroughs were disappointed. A few teachers at the job fair were in tears.</p>
        <p>But others were glad to be assigned to a challenging school, saying they had gone into the profession to work with children who needed the most help.</p>
        <p>''I really want to teach disadvantaged kids,'' said Waithira Mbuthia-Protano of Mamaroneck, N.Y., who accepted a job teaching English at Alfred E. Smith High School in the Bronx, a failing school. ''I want to give, I want to sweat, I want to give all my energy to help.''</p>
        <p>To lure certified teachers into the failing schools, the Board of Education is offering teachers $3,400 in tuition reimbursement over the next four years. The failing schools also have smaller classes, and teachers get extra help from curriculum specialists. This summer, the board recruited about 330 people with little or no teaching experience to work in the failing schools under an alternative certification program. The board has also held several job fairs for the failing schools since Aug. 1, when Mr. Mills, unsatisfied by the city's pace in hiring certified teachers for those schools, filed his lawsuit.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Mills said certified teachers who did not want to set foot inside the failing schools should reconsider, because the students at those schools badly needed qualified teachers.</p>
        <p>''People are going to have to be guided by their better angels,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He added, ''This court action has led to profound change in the way the city places teachers, and it's high time.'' The failing schools ''were always last in line, and now they are first in line.''</p>
        <p>But the other parties to the settlement that resulted in the court order were still unhappy with its terms. Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said any teacher who agreed to work in an urban school was taking on a major challenge. ''People who choose urban education are doing God's work,'' he said, ''and where they choose to teach and how they choose to dedicate themselves is a matter of personal reflection.''</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents New York City teachers, said the city was doing the right thing by assigning new certified teachers to the failing schools first. But she said the frustration among new teachers was troubling.</p>
        <p>''At a time when the city is begging for teachers, you will lose people when you mandate where they work,'' Ms. Weingarten said.</p>
        <p>However, Ms. Weingarten predicted that the number of new teachers who refused to work in New York City as a result of the court order would be relatively small. For one thing, the failing schools are hiring more certified teachers than they expect to need, just to be on the safe side. After the school year starts on Thursday, certified teachers who are not needed at the failing schools will be assigned elsewhere, she said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levy said it was too early to tell whether the court order would have the unfortunate effect of increasing the number of uncertified teachers in schools that are not listed as failing.</p>
        <p>''My fervent hope is that it's a momentary aberration,'' he said. While the order benefits the failing schools, he said, ''it obviously does nothing'' for the other city schools.</p>
        <p>In a report released yesterday, the nonprofit Citizens Budget Commission said one way to find enough certified teachers for all 1,100 of the city's public schools would be to offer substantially higher salaries -- up to 25 percent higher -- to teachers who agreed to work in failing and other hard-to-staff schools. The city now gives 15 percent raises to teachers who agree to work in 39 failing schools that are in session an hour longer than regular schools. But the incentive is not enough to draw as many certified teachers as those schools need.</p>
        <p>By yesterday afternoon, Ms. Walker, the teacher who was turned away from Kennedy High School, was hopeful that she would land a job at George Washington High School, a failing school in Washington Heights. She was relieved because the alternative was to work at Smith High School, which is in the Bronx but is much farther away -- about an hour using public transportation -- from her new apartment.</p>
        <p>While the last-minute wrench in her plans upset her, she said it was not enough to make her abandon the city school system.</p>
        <p>''I would never leave the system,'' she said. ''I just don't appreciate the system forcing me to rearrange my life.''</p>
