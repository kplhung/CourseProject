        <p>China is allowing foreign insurance companies to buy up to 25 percent of domestic insurers, opening a fast track for foreign companies eager to get into the growing market. In the first of what is expected to be several such deals, five foreign companies, including the Zurich Insurance Company, the International Finance Corporation and the Meiji Life Insurance Company, based in Japan, have agreed to buy 24.9 percent of the New China Life Insurance Company, according to yesterday's China Daily. Foreign insurers have complained about waiting years for licenses to operate in the country. Only a handful of foreign licenses have been issued, most recently to the Chubb Corporation, which filed its application seven years ago. The share sale will increase New China's net assets to $193 million from about $76 million.</p>
