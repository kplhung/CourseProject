        <p>''Whipped'' may set an all-time record for raw tonnage of sexual fear and loathing spewed per minute by a Hollywood movie. This bottom-feeding monstrosity of a comedy was produced, directed and written by Peter M. Cohen, whose screenplay conjures more leering euphemisms for male body parts and sexual acts than any film in recent memory.</p>
        <p>The characters who sling the dirt are three Manhattan yuppies who take nasty relish in ''scamming'' attractive young women into sleeping with them. Brad (Brian Van Holt), the slickest of the three, likes to approach strangers and pretend to be their best friend's brother. That best friend is always named Jen, he sneers, since ''they all have friends named Jen.'' In his mind's eye, Brad is a sophisticated Manhattan answer to Tom Cruise in ''Risky Business.''</p>

        <p>''Whipped'' may set an all-time record for raw tonnage of sexual fear and loathing spewed per minute by a Hollywood movie. This bottom-feeding monstrosity of a comedy was produced, directed and written by Peter M. Cohen, whose screenplay conjures more leering euphemisms for male body parts and sexual acts than any film in recent memory.</p>
        <p>The characters who sling the dirt are three Manhattan yuppies who take nasty relish in ''scamming'' attractive young women into sleeping with them. Brad (Brian Van Holt), the slickest of the three, likes to approach strangers and pretend to be their best friend's brother. That best friend is always named Jen, he sneers, since ''they all have friends named Jen.'' In his mind's eye, Brad is a sophisticated Manhattan answer to Tom Cruise in ''Risky Business.''</p>
        <p>Zeke (Zorie Barber), who has no doubts that he's the coolest dude on the planet, identifies with the young Mickey Rourke and affects a shallow post-Beat hipness. Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams), the sensitive one, wears a goatee and talks about being in touch with his feminine side. Hanging on to their coattails is their old friend Eric (Judah Domke), who has been married for two years and tries (but fails) to impress them with his tales of domestic sexual exploits involving a juicer and an egg beater.</p>
        <p>Who are these guys anyway? They must be fairly well heeled. Yet for men in their 20's, they talk as if their brains were implants wrested from frightened 14-year-old male virgins. Each week this pathetic group meets for Sunday breakfast, where they exchange gross-out descriptions of their latest conquests. These rap sessions, in which the euphemisms fly, make up most of the movie's attempts at humor. But the dirty talk is so painfully forced and emphatic it lacks any comic spontaneity. Even the movie's signature gross-out bit, in which a young man desperately tries to retrieve a whirring vibrator from an unflushed toilet, is bungled.</p>
        <p>At one Sunday brunch Brad, Zeke and Jonathan rhapsodize over having finally met that special someone whom they can actually respect. Their dream dates turn out to be the same woman, Mia (Amanda Peet), who picked up all three within a matter of days. Mia has that rare knack of being all things to all men: beautiful, sensual, caring, worshipful, a perfect companion and sizzling bed partner.</p>
        <p>There are moments when this dirty-mouthed revenge comedy becomes so mean-spirited that you almost gasp at its cruelty. As the crafty Mia carries on simultaneous affairs with these besotted idiots, vowing to each that he's the one she truly loves, they unaccountably turn on one other instead of on her. When we finally hear Mia's side of the story, her contemptuous evaluations of these self-styled Don Juans' sexual performance and physical attributes carry comic sexual warfare in the movies to a new low.</p>
        <p>''Whipped'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The sexual innuendo is nonstop.</p>
        <p>WHIPPED</p>
        <p>Written, produced and directed by Peter M. Cohen; director of photography, Peter B. Kowalski; edited by Tom McArdle; music by Michael Montes; production designer, Katherine M. Szilagyi; released by Destination Films. Running time: 82 minutes. This film is rated R.</p>
        <p>WITH: Amanda Peet (Mia), Brian Van Holt (Brad), Jonathan Abrahams (Jonathan), Zorie Barber (Zeke) and Judah Domke (Eric).</p>
