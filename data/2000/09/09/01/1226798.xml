        <p>By calling in sick on the first day of his corruption trial, Indonesia's former leader, Suharto, has put up another hurdle to this country's tortuous effort to come to terms with its past.</p>
        <p>Government prosecutors said today that they would plow ahead with their prosecution of Mr. Suharto on charges that he siphoned about $590 million in state funds through several charitable foundations under his control when he was president.</p>
        <p>But with the trial adjourned until Sept. 14 -- and then only to hear testimony from doctors who declared Mr. Suharto unfit to attend the opening session today -- it is far from clear that the 79-year-old former president will ever stand in the dock.</p>
        <p>''Suharto will never be convicted,'' A. M. Fatwa, a member of Parliament, said as he stalked angrily out of the courtroom. ''This is only a game, a conspiracy between the politicians and lawyers.''</p>
        <p>Still, for a hushed moment after the judge asked whether the defendant was present, there was palpable drama in the courtroom. To hear Mr. Suharto's name read out in a criminal case was a momentous event in a country where for three decades he was synonymous with untold wealth and unassailable power.</p>
        <p>When the judge's question was met with silence, the 300 spectators in the cavernous courtroom booed halfheartedly, like people who had hoped for more but did not expect to get it. Outside, a small crowd of rain-soaked protesters called for Mr. Suharto to be brought to justice, by force if necessary.</p>
        <p>''If he does not come in two weeks, I will drag him to the court myself,'' said Bambang Dwi, a 23-year-old student at the Institute of Technology in Jakarta, who held a megaphone over his head to ward off the downpour.</p>
        <p>But given the judgment of Mr. Suharto's doctors, it is not clear that the government can compel him to attend. The attorney general, Marsuki Darusman, says he cannot be tried in absentia, so the two sides are in a standoff.</p>
        <p>For now, the prosecutors have asked for an independent panel of doctors to examine Mr. Suharto. His own doctors say he suffers from ailments including heart trouble, hypertension and diabetes. They say Mr. Suharto, who has had three strokes, has lost his memory and ability to speak.</p>
        <p>''My client is not in a position to defend himself,'' said Juan Felix Tampubolon, Mr. Suharto's chief lawyer.</p>
        <p>The former president may be unable to mount a defense, but he has mobilized an army of lawyers and doctors to do it for him. Twenty-three doctors gathered this morning to examine him at his house on a leafy street here. Later, more than 100 police officers took up positions to protect the house from demonstrators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Suharto tried to wrap his dealings in a cloak of legitimacy. In the 45-page indictment, he is accused of issuing presidential decrees that funneled hundreds of millions of dollars from state banks, companies and even employees into his seven charitable organizations.</p>
        <p>In a 1995 decree, Mr. Suharto ordered the government to transfer 2 percent of the total revenue from taxes paid by Indonesian companies into one of the foundations. In another decree, he ordered state-owned banks to contribute a chunk of their revenues to two other foundations.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, he then distributed the proceeds -- nearly $600 million -- to companies controlled by his children and friends. Those accusations cover only a fraction of the financial legerdemain that Mr. Suharto is accused of during his 32 years in power. But the government says it did not have enough evidence to try him on the broader charges.</p>
        <p>''It is very difficult to deal with the excesses of an autocratic regime through democratic means,'' said H. S. Dillon, a member of Indonesia's Human Rights Commission.</p>
        <p>Although Indonesia is awash in trials and investigations these days, protesters have channeled their passions into the Suharto case. People here view the trial as the litmus test of the government's campaign to cleanse Indonesia -- not just of corruption, but of its legacy of human rights abuses.</p>
        <p>''You have to find this man culpable, or you won't be able to find all his cronies culpable,'' Mr. Dillon said.  ''They will just say, 'We were acting on orders.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dillon acknowledged that Indonesia had made paltry progress so far.</p>
        <p>While Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman Wahid, authorized the investigation of Mr. Suharto, he too has been implicated in two parliamentary investigations of misappropriated funds that seem an echo of the Suharto era.</p>
        <p>There may be more disappointment to come. On Friday, Attorney General Darusman is expected to disclose the names of officials who will prosecuted for human rights abuses in East Timor, during the rampage that followed last summer's referendum on independence for the former Indonesian province.</p>
        <p>According to people who have seen the list, it does not include two ranking military officers, retired General  Wiranto, who was defense minister during that period, and the retired chief of military intelligence, Gen. Zaki Anwar.</p>
        <p>While the 30 names do include the former regional military commander and the former police commander, the lack of top-level officials could sow doubts about how far Indonesia is willing to go in assigning blame for the bloodshed that erupted in East Timor while its troops were supposed to be keeping order.</p>
        <p>More doubts were raised by a recent amendment to Indonesia's Constitution that prohibits individuals from being prosecuted under laws that did not exist when their crimes were committed.</p>
        <p>Rights groups protested that the amendment would allow military officers accused of abuses in East Timor to claim immunity from prosecution. The United Nations, which has so far held off convening a tribunal to investigate East Timor, said the amendment might lead it to reconsider.</p>
