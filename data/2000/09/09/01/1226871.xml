        <p>There appears to be no link between reduced logging on national forests over the last decade and the wildfires now raging through much of the West, a report by a bipartisan research group for Congress has found.</p>
        <p>If anything, heavy logging from earlier years may have contributed more to the conditions that have made Western forests ripe for big fires, because more flammable small trees and heavy brush are often left in the forest after the larger stands of timber have been taken out, said the report, by the Congressional Research Service, which analyzes policy for Congress.</p>
        <p>Over the last month, Western Republicans, and Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, have said that logging reductions under the Clinton administration have been a cause of fires that have burned more than six million acres this year. Logging in national forests has been reduced by more than 75 percent since 1989.</p>
        <p>Speaking in Oregon earlier this month, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican presidential nominee, said Clinton administration policies that restricted logging ''made the forests more dangerous to fire,'' although he did not blame the president for the fires.</p>
        <p>But some of the years with the most fires over the last two decades were those in which logging was at record high levels, the report states.</p>
        <p>''Timber harvesting removes the relatively large diameter wood that can be converted into wood products, but leaves behind the small material, especially twigs and needles,'' wrote Ross W. Gorte, author of the report. ''The concentration of these 'fine fuels' on the forest floor increases the rate of spread of wildfires.''</p>
        <p>The report was done at the request of Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, but it was conducted by the agency that analyzes policy for all of Congress. Some Republicans who have linked Clinton forest policies to the fires say the report is not conclusive enough to determine policy.</p>
        <p>''It presents a mixed picture,'' said Gov. Marc Racicot, Republican of Montana. ''This year is the lowest ever for timber harvesting and it could be the worst fire year in decades.''</p>
        <p>Next week, the Clinton administration plans to release its recommendations on how to manage more than 40 million acres that are considered to be at extreme risk of wildfires.</p>
        <p>''These fires are being used by both the timber industry and environmentalists,'' Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said. ''One side says increase logging; the other side says no logging, even thinning. Neither position is the accurate way to address forest health problems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt said the commercial logging program for national forests would not play a significant role in the plan to be presented next week. The plan will try to restore forest health through controlled burns and some thinning, and try to get people who live in forested areas that are high-fire risks to clear the hazards near their homes, he said.</p>
        <p>The report looked at logging and fires for each of the last 20 years. The years in which there was the highest volume of logging -- 1987 and 1988 -- were also years in which the highest number of acres of national forest lands burned. The report does not address this year, when logging has been at a historic low, and the fires are at near-record highs.</p>
        <p>''The assertion has been that we're getting more acres burned as we have reduced the timber harvesting levels,'' Mr. Gorte said in an interview. ''In fact, for the most part, we were getting fewer acres burned.''</p>
        <p>In the West, 77 large fires were burning 1.6 million acres on Thursday, but forecasters held out hope for residents and firefighters as their predictions called for rain and cooler temperatures across the northern Rockies through Monday.</p>
        <p>The fires have been at the heart of a clamorous debate in the West. On Tuesday, on the day that Vice President Al Gore made a campaign stop in Oregon, a number of groups that favor more logging took out full-page advertisements in the state, blaming the vice president for the fires.</p>
        <p>Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, has been critical of Mr. Clinton's timber policies, saying forest neglect and mismanagement have contributed to the fires.</p>
        <p>''If you look at things on a short-term basis, we could concede some of the points made in this report,'' said Joe Sheffo, a spokesman for Mr. Smith. ''But the fact is we have a cumulative problem. And the Clinton administration has known about it for years.''</p>
