        <p>The Devil is having a good season. In London, the 57-year-old British acotr Ian McShane is playing him onstage in Cameron Mackintosh's musical version of ''The Witches of Eastwick.'' In Hollywood, the 35-year-old model and actress Elizabeth Hurley is playing her in an American remake of ''Bedazzled,'' opening next month. Knowing the true nature of the Devil is, of course, difficult. But his or her incarnations in roughly 75 years of film on video do indicate that we should beware of men in black, apartments that are too good to be true, and lawyers. Although in ''The Book of Life'' the legal types (the firm of Armageddon, Aramgeddo &amp; Jehosaphat) work for God.</p>
