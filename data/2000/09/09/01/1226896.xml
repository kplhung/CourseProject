        <p>A young New Jersey mother was charged with assault yesterday after she confessed to severely beating her 18-month-old daughter, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The child, Kamouri Grant, who suffered severe head injuries, was in critical condition yesterday at University Hospital in Newark. Hospital officials said she was nonresponsive and on life support.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Bronx district attorney said the mother, Tyesha Turnage, 18, of Irvington, N.J., was to be arraigned by this morning in Bronx Criminal Court. She faces charges of first- and second-degree assault.</p>
        <p>The police said that doctors had determined that the beatings took place over several days, going back perhaps as far as Saturday. The most severe injuries occurred while Ms. Turnage was visiting her boyfriend at 2885 Valentine Avenue in the Bedford Park section of the Bronx, they said. They said that witnesses told them they saw Ms. Turnage hitting the child with a belt in her boyfriend's apartment building.</p>
        <p>The boyfriend has not been charged, and the police did not release his name.</p>
        <p>Ms. Turnage took the baby to the hospital late Tuesday or early Wednesday, the police said, and hospital officials notified the authorities in New Jersey, who then contacted those in New York. The authorities said that Ms. Turnage admitted to the crimes at 9 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Kamouri was on a ventilator and was suffering from severe head trauma and bruises to her stomach, said a spokesman for University Hospital, Rogers Ramsey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramsey said it was difficult to tell whether the child was not responding because she was in a coma or because she was heavily medicated.</p>
        <p>A friend of Ms. Turnage, Lashaunda Morgan, said the two met about five years ago as students at Irvington High School. She said she was shocked when she heard of the charges because she knew Ms. Turnage to be a patient mother who seemed content to forfeit social events to spend time with her child.</p>
        <p>''She always has the baby with her,'' said Ms. Morgan, 20. ''She's always taking the baby to the park. She's always playing with the baby. She's always talking to the baby. I've never seen her lose her cool with the baby.''</p>
        <p>About two weeks ago, Ms. Morgan said, she and Ms. Turnage spent the evening sitting on the steps outside 36 Bruen Avenue in Irvington, where Ms. Turnage and Kamouri live with Ms. Turnage's mother, grandmother and sisters. That evening, Ms. Morgan said, Kamouri played on the porch before crawling onto her lap.</p>
        <p>''She's always seemed patient with the baby,'' Ms. Morgan said of Ms. Turnage. ''She seemed happy to me.''</p>
