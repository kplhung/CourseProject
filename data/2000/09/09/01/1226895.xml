        <p>A jet fighter that conked out on a routine training mission was ditched into the ocean off Atlantic City yesterday afternoon by a pilot who ejected safely. The pilot, whose name was not immediately released, parachuted into rough seas and was picked up by a state police boat as crowds of beachgoers, lifeguards and Boardwalk strollers watched the spectacle.</p>
        <p>Military authorities said last night that the pilot, realizing that his faltering jet could not reach its base west of Atlantic City and that he would have to bail out, headed back out to sea to avoid a crash on land that might have taken a heavy toll in life and property.</p>
        <p>The pilot was praised by his superiors at a news conference last night. ''He wanted to reduce the risk to people,'' said Lt. Col. Mike Cosby, operations group commander of the 177th Fighter Wing of the New Jersey Air National Guard. ''To his credit, his decision was based on avoiding collateral damage.''</p>
        <p>Colonel Cosby and other officials said the jet, an $18 million F-16C Falcon interceptor that carried no armaments, had taken off with three other fighters for training exercises over the Atlantic. On the way back to base at Atlantic City International Airport, in Pomona, he said, the jet's oil pressure dropped and the engine began to fail.</p>
        <p>Four miles from base, he said, the pilot turned around and headed seaward. He barely made it. Passing over the Boardwalk and beaches of Atlantic City, the plane lost power. The plane was about 2,000 feet up and traveling at 140 knots, the colonel said, when the pilot blew his canopy off and ejected.</p>
        <p>It was a stunning drama for hundreds of spectators on the beaches, jetties and Boardwalk. They told of jets thundering overhead, of sudden flames from the tail of one aircraft and of a flier bailing out and floating down into Absecon Inlet at the north end of Atlantic City, while his plane plunged into the sea a mile and a half offshore at 3:40 p.m.</p>
        <p>The pilot, who inflated a raft, was in the water 10 to 15 minutes, bobbing in five-foot swells, before a state police patrol boat from Atlantic City drew up and Troopers Thomas Sost, John Schreiner and Dean Rocap pulled him in.</p>
        <p>''He was sitting there in his raft, smiling from here to here,'' Trooper Sost recalled. ''It was not what we expected to see.''</p>
        <p>The pilot, who was said to have 12 years of flying experience in F-16 jets, was not seriously injured, officials said, but was taken to the Atlantic City Medical Center and treated for trauma and bruises.</p>
