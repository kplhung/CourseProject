        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There is no better place in New York City to experience chamber music with the proper intimacy than at the concerts presented by Bargemusic, the rewarding weekly series that takes place on an acoustically ideal and commodious barge in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge.

Works by Loeffler and Mozart complete the program. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon the fine clarinetist Thomas Hill is the featured performer in a program that offers Schumann's ''Fairy Tales,'' Brahms's Clarinet Trio and Mozart's Clarinet Quintet.

        <p>BEETHOVEN FESTIVAL. With relatively little competition for music festivals at this time of year, here is a fast-paced one that competes with itself. Presented by Friends of the Arts, programs (mostly single works) take place  from noon to to 4 p.m. in Coe Hall and the Hay Barn. But the festival finale stands alone at 4:15 in the Hay Barn, a substantial program ending with the venerable Claude Frank playing Beethoven's final piano sonata, Opus 111. Paul Peabody offers a free marionette program for children at 11:15 at the festival pavilion. Sunday from 12 to 6 p.m., Planting Fields Arboretum, Planting Fields Road, Oyster Bay, N.Y., (516) 922-0061. Tickets: $25, covering all events (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>FRIENDS OF MAVERICK CONCERT. The enterprising Maverick series closes its season with a fund-raising concert with an unusual program. At its heart is music for multiple cellos, including the Villa-Lobos ''Bachianas Brasileiras'' No. 5, for soprano and eight cellos, and three works by Alan Shulman, a ''Suite Miniature'' for cello octet, and ''Pastoral'' and ''Two Pairs,'' each for four cellos. Also on the program is a group of movements from Bach Cantatas. Sunday at 3 p.m. Maverick Concerts, Maverick Road between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., just outside Woodstock. (914) 246-3077. Tickets: $25.(Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>HANOVERIAN ENSEMBLE. This period instrument band is offering an all-Bach program at the open concert barn at Maverick Concerts. The program includes the Suite No. 2, the Violin Concerto in E, and the Concerto for Flute, Violin and Harpsichord. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Maverick Concerts, Maverick Road between Routes 28 and 375, West Hurley, N.Y., just outside Woodstock. (914) 679-8217 Tickets: $15, $5 for students (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MONADNOCK MUSIC. Russell Sherman is one of the most technically formidable and musically probing pianists of our time. That said, his strong interpretive ideas frequently divide listeners. But he is always an interesting artist. This weekend, as part of the rewarding Monadnock Music festival, based in Peterborough, N.H., Mr. Sherman will perform all five Beethoven piano concertos on two programs with the Monadnock Music Festival Orchestra, conducted by James Bolle. Tonight he plays the first three concertos. On Sunday afternoon he offers the fourth and fifth. The performances are being recorded for future commercial release. Monadnock Music Festival. Peterborough Town House, Grove and Main Streets, Peterborough, N.H. Tonight at 8: Beethoven Piano Concertos Nos. 1 to 3; Sunday at 4 p.m.: Beethoven Piano Concertos Nos. 4 and 5. Tickets: $16 to $28; (603) 924-7610 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MUSIC MOUNTAIN. It is hard to see why this attractive chamber-music festival, in its 71st season, has not developed a higher profile. Here, the Shanghai String Quartet offers two juicy programs (including music by Mozart, Beethoven, Shostakovich and Bright Sheng) and is joined by the pianist Ruth Laredo in a work of Brahms to end each. Tomorrow, it is Brahms's G-minor Piano Quartet, which these performers played impressively eight years ago at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and on Sunday it is Brahms's great and formidable Piano Quintet. A preconcert event ''The Return of the Canine Quadrille,'' at 2 on Sunday, is described as ''a congenial group of dogs dancing with their human partners.'' (Well, let's think again about that profile.) Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 3 p.m., Music Mountain, Music Mountain Road, Falls Village, Conn., (860) 824-7126. Tickets: $18; $15 in advance; $10 for students (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NATIONAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA. For the orchestra's annual Labor Day celebration, Takao Kanayama, its assistant conductor, leads a mixed bag of Americana, including the inevitable (''Stars and Stripes Forever'' and ''America the Beautiful'') and the less so (excerpts from Schuman's ''New England Triptych,'' selections from Bernstein's ''West Side Story'' and the Scherzo from Still's ''Afro-American Symphony''). Sunday at 8 p.m., Capitol West Lawn, Washington, (202) 467-4600 or (800) 444-1324. Admission: free (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>SKANEATELES FESTIVAL. Now that most other summer festivals have pulled up stakes, it may be time to dig out the map and start exploring. Tucked away in Skaneateles, near Syracuse, this event is directed by Diane Walsh, a pianist. Tonight, Ms. Walsh spars with the theatrical comic Bill Irwin in spoofs including ''The Page Turner,'' which, for longtime concertgoers, let alone some of us forcibly retired page turners, may be hard put to rival real and legendary disasters. Tomorrow, Peter Bay conducts the festival orchestra to close the season with -- what else? -- Haydn's ''Farewell'' Symphony (though surely, to savor the exquisite joke of the players dispersing a few at a time, the work should come at the end of the program, not before intermission) along with Mozart arias and Schubert's Fifth Symphony. Tonight at 8, Skaneateles High School, East Elizabeth Street; tomorrow night at 8, Brook Farm, Route 41A, south of Skaneateles, (315) 685-7418. Tickets: tonight, $10 to $16; tomorrow, $20 and $25; free to children under 13 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>SOUTH MOUNTAIN CONCERTS. Is there music in the Berkshire Hills after Tanglewood and other major festivals have closed? Yes indeed, in one of the oldest festivals of them all, now beginning its 82nd season. Here, in a well-mixed program of classics, the Borromeo String Quartet plays Mozart's C major Quartet (K. 465, the ''Dissonant'') and Bartok's First Quartet, and is joined by David Shifrin in Brahms's Clarinet Quintet. Sunday at 3 p.m., South Mountain Concert Hall, Routes 7 and 20, Pittsfield, Mass., (413) 442-2106. Remaining tickets: $24 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>''DANCE AT THE WHITE BARN THEATER.'' Lucile Lortel began to present dance at her White Barn theater in 1949, with performances by Katherine Dunham's company. This exhibition of archival photographs, costumes and memorabilia chosen by Lynn Garafola, curator of the show, spans a wide range of dance personalities and styles, from ballet and modern to ethnic and Broadway musical theater dance. The show runs through Sunday. Today through Sunday, 7 to 10 p.m. Free. White Barn Theater, Newtown Turnpike, Westport, Conn.; (203) 227-3768 (Jennifer Dunning).</p>
        <p>KANKOURAN WEST AFRICAN DANCE COMPANY. A 70-member troupe, founded by Assane Konte and Abdou Kounta, dedicated to preserving African traditional arts and giving audiences a sense of their historical contexts. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Tickets: $20; $18 for students and the elderly; $15 for children under 12. George Washington University, Lisner Auditorium, 730 21st Street, N.W. at H Street, Washington; (202) 994-6800 (Dunning).</p>
