        <p>THE ''ladies who lunch'' seem to have had their fill of fur coats, so American Legend, the maker of the finest mink coat available, is turning to their daughters to try to convince them that mink is the ultimate luxury item and an absolute fashion must.</p>
        <p>To do that, Legend is introducing a print campaign that drops the stodgy studio glamour shots of a sophisticated model clad in a full length mommy-looking mink coat in favor of a sexy young model on the beach posing in versatile mink items including a skimpy mink bikini.</p>

        <p>THE ''ladies who lunch'' seem to have had their fill of fur coats, so American Legend, the maker of the finest mink coat available, is turning to their daughters to try to convince them that mink is the ultimate luxury item and an absolute fashion must.</p>
        <p>To do that, Legend is introducing a print campaign that drops the stodgy studio glamour shots of a sophisticated model clad in a full length mommy-looking mink coat in favor of a sexy young model on the beach posing in versatile mink items including a skimpy mink bikini.</p>
        <p>''We're not trying to sell grandmom's fur coat any longer,'' said Edward Brennan, the chief executive of American Legend, which is based in Seattle. ''When we decided to relaunch our new vision, we said, 'Now we want to position it from a fashion perspective, keep it totally unexpected and young.' ''</p>
        <p>After a considerable amount of consumer research, Mr. Brennan said, it is clear that the positioning of the company's fur coats in North America was ''not really effective in terms of bringing back young potential consumers.'' Therefore, he added, ''our strategy was all about bringing something to a fashion-forward girl that's modern, exciting, fun and useful.''</p>
        <p>Instead of focusing on the traditional mink coat, the campaign is focusing on nontraditional mink  clothing and accessories with casual chic attitudes, like cropped bolero jackets in various colors, vests, knitted sweaters, fur-trimmed jeans, blankets, headbands, bikinis, hats and purses.</p>
        <p>''Our objective is not only to draw consumers' attention to the high fashionability of mink, but also create awareness for Legend the brand,'' Mr. Brennan said. ''It is important that consumers recognize that mink is not a commodity. If they want the very best quality, they need to look for the Legend label.''</p>
        <p>Legend is designed and sold by J. Mendel on Madison Avenue and through his salon in Bergdorf Goodman. Legend will also be available this month through the company's Web site at www.legendmink.com.</p>
        <p>A decade or so ago, furs had fallen out of fashion as the economy dipped and they became associated with spray-paint assaults by animal rights protesters. It was also all the rage for celebrities to lend their faces to ads that stated that they'd rather be naked than wear fur.</p>
        <p>In the last couple of years, however, the taboo has lifted somewhat and fur has quietly crept back into the American fashion world, first by showing up in the lines of many top designers on collar trims and accessories. Now it has boldly asserted itself in full-page fashion layouts.</p>
        <p>American Legend has had a history of memorable ads that also featured celebrities, taking pro-fur stances, of course. In the 1960's, the company along with the adman Peter Rogers created the long-running campaign ''What Becomes a Legend Most'' for one of its other trademarks, Blackgama. Those ads featured stars like Lauren Bacall, Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland, Rita Hayworth, Lena Horn, Barbra Streisand and many others swathed in fur.</p>
        <p>The latest campaign, created by Laspata/DeCaro in New York with billings estimated at $2 million, also features an ''it'' girl. This time, though, she comes from the fashion world, not Hollywood. The supermodel Frankie Rayder is featured posing on a beach in Malibu, Calif., in a retro satire of 1960's surf movies like ''Beach Blanket Bingo'' and ''How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.'' And who better to join her for a cameo appearance? The king of those surf movies himself, Frankie Avalon.</p>
        <p>''We looked to showcase the brand in the most unexpected light,'' said Charles DeCaro, creative director at Laspata/DeCaro. ''And what could be more unexpected than mink on the beach?</p>
        <p>''Obviously with a 'Beach Blanket Bingo' subtext to the campaign, it was sort of a no-brainer to contact someone that was part of that genre, and Frankie Avalon seemed the perfect addition,'' Mr. DeCaro added. ''He was the remaining ingredient that this whole equation needed.''</p>
        <p>In the ad featuring the two Frankies, they are shown posing in a bit of an awkward embrace. She looks secure and sultry in her $5,500 mink- and-leather bikini and sarong. He is clad in all white, yet not quite sure what to do with himself. As a wink to both Mr. Avalon's film career as well as the famous ad campaign that inspired the Legend brand, Mr. Avalon's white shirt says ''What Becomes a Legend Most?''</p>
        <p>''We did not want to set out to recreate the Legend campaigns of the past,'' Mr. DeCaro said. ''They were phenomenal and iconic in their genre.'' But for the new campaign, he continued, ''it was much more important to capture the fashion pulse in a very sort of tongue-in-check way.'' The subtle way that they reintroduced the famous line on Mr. Avalon's T-shirt was ''definitely a segue to possible future campaigns,'' Mr. DeCaro added.</p>
        <p>Thirteen other ads feature Ms. Rayder wearing a variety of mink items. One ad shows her wearing a white mink sweater over a daisy bathing suit as she joins four tanned, clean-cut surfers in carrying a surfboard. Another ad features her dancing on the beach with the same models, this time wearing a creamy gold mink bolero over a gold lame bikini top and pants. All the ads have the tagline: ''J. Mendel for Legend. American Legend Mink.''</p>
        <p>''We really wanted to show the diversity of the brand,'' Mr. DeCaro said. The technology is so much more advanced than it was in the past that mink can now be used in many different ways, including being cut to look like corduroy or even resemble velvet, Mr. DeCaro added.</p>
        <p>''It was more important to get that across and definitely reach toward a younger, more hip consumer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The campaign begins running in the September issues of magazines including Elle, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, In Style, Nylon, Town &amp; Country, Vanity Fair and Wallpaper. This is the second effort from Laspata/ DeCaro since it was awarded the account in August 1999.</p>
        <p>''We intend to position Legend as the very best of the best, so would the average girl be able to go in and buy a beautiful Legend bikini?'' Mr. Brennan asked. ''I would say no. But, in fact would it interest her to go look at other products that could be affordable and really could be useful today that she is not aware of at the moment? Absolutely yes. And that's the point.''</p>
        <p>THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING  Correction:  September 4, 2000, Monday  The Advertising column in Business Day on Friday, about a campaign for American Legend mink coats, misspelled the surname of a singer and actress who appeared in earlier advertisements. She is Lena Horne, not Horn.</p>
