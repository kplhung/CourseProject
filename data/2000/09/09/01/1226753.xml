        <p>A powerful queen. A mystical ram. Marauding lions. A gigantic lyre.</p>
        <p>They sound like the elements of a rich fairy tale. But in fact they are parts of a real history revealed in ''Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur,'' an exhibition at the Pierpont Morgan Library. The library has recently begun offering family tours of the display, perhaps in recognition of the threads of mystery, adventure and folklore running through it.</p>
        <p>The tours let children feel as if they were stepping into the shoes of Indiana Jones, an archaeologist as well as a dashing hero. They're actually stepping into the shoes of C. Leonard Woolley, a more sedate fellow who in 1928 led the dig at Ur, a Sumerian city in what is now Iraq.</p>
        <p>''What do you think of when you think of treasure?'' asked Anne Willieme, the tour guide when I visited with my 5-year-old, Matthew. He grew saucer-eyed when told that the objects were 5,000 years old and had belonged to Puabi, a queen. All that was needed, I thought, was for mummies to appear.</p>
        <p>Matthew was especially intrigued by a case filled with daggers, spears and arrowheads. ''Are these a lot of weapons?'' he asked. ''Wow!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Willieme observed, ''People believed that when you died, you went to a spirit world and had to take things with you.'' What Puabi took was remarkable, ranging from elaborate jewelry to most of her servants. (This was noted delicately.)</p>
        <p>The children are given art materials to sketch the artifacts. They also each receive a drawing of Puabi, which they can embellish with sketches of objects from the exhibition or from their own imaginations, well enriched by their vicarious visits to ancient Mesopotamia.</p>
        <p>Family tours of ''Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur,'' Saturdays at 11 a.m. and Sundays at 3 p.m. through Sept. 10 at the Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 590-0331. Free with requested contribution: $8; $6 for the elderly and students; children 12 and under, free. Reservations advised.</p>
        <p>Flight Paths</p>
        <p>Summer is one of the best times to observe things that fly. And though the season itself is now on the wing, you still have two weeks to enjoy the Butterfly and Hummingbird Trail, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden's tribute to flying creatures that make up in beauty what they lack in size.</p>
        <p>The trail, meant to be followed with the help of a colorful map and field guide, is really two. The south trail, which takes about an hour, is especially recommended for children; the north, about a half-hour, is less exciting but includes a duck pond. Each is marked with signs and small activity stations, where children can stamp their maps and feel like official explorers.</p>
        <p>For my daughter and son, the biggest hit was the south trail's Logania Family Beds, which the map said were ''guaranteed to be loaded with butterflies.'' We saw monarchs, eastern tiger swallowtails, painted ladies, great spangled fritillaries and a breathtaking indigo blue species that our maps didn't identify.</p>
        <p>The south trail also leads through the Discovery Garden, filled with play stations, and past the Teaching Pavilion, which offers weekend programs for children 5 to 12. This month they can make a butterfly from a party blower.</p>
        <p>Another favorite stop was the Conservatory Annual Beds, where my daughter, Marisa, briefly coaxed a monarch to sit on her finger.</p>
        <p>Subject to the whims of the wildlife, we never did see a hummingbird. But we did spy two rabbits. Judging from their speed, they might just as well have been flying.</p>
        <p>Butterfly and Hummingbird Trail, through Sept. 16 at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 900 Washington Avenue, Prospect Heights, (718) 623-7200. Hours: Tuesday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday, Sunday and holidays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free with admission: $3; $1.50 for the elderly and students; under 16, free. Free all day Tuesday and on Saturday from 10 a.m. to noon.</p>
        <p>And the Winner Is . . .</p>
        <p>If watching ''Survivor'' set your competitive juices flowing, you may want to test your own survival skills this weekend at the Richmond County Fair on Staten Island. Granted, the stakes are lower, but the challenges are much more amusing and far less cutthroat.</p>
        <p>You can test your endurance on the Hula Hoop twist, your agility in the potato sack race and your alimentary speed (and shamelessness) in the pie-eating contest. If you're the type to form alliances, try the three-legged race, the water-balloon toss or the turtle and frog-jumping races (entrants not provided).</p>
        <p>There is even a diaper derby, or crawling race. ''Usually a parent stands at the finish line, saying, 'C'mon, little Susie,' '' said Ellie Galizia, the director of special events for the Staten Island Historical Society, the fair's sponsor.</p>
        <p>The fair benefits Historic Richmond Town, a complex of restored 18th- and 19th-century buildings with costumed guides. Children will be invited to dress up in reproduction period clothing and learn how to milk cows, churn butter and shuck corn.</p>
        <p>The event will also include music, puppet shows, pony rides, a magician, a hypnotist and a pig race.</p>
        <p>No millionaires will be crowned, but, as Ms. Galizia said, ''at Richmond Town, every child is a winner.'' And a survivor.</p>
        <p>Richmond County Fair, tomorrow and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Monday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Historic Richmond Town, 441 Clarke Avenue, Richmond, (718) 351-1611. Admission: $6; $3 for the elderly and ages 6 to 16; under 6, free.</p>
