        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, is correct when he says the United States must do more to reduce the demand of its citizens for illegal drugs (front page, Aug. 30). Yet like so many Americans, he seems unaware of just how much progress has been made toward this goal.</p>
        <p>Of all the antidrug efforts undertaken by this country, none have been as successful as the fight to reduce demand. Since 1985, regular use of illegal drugs is down by 50 percent; regular use of cocaine is down more than 70 percent; and there are 9.7 million fewer regular adult users of illegal drugs.</p>
        <p>Since there is widespread agreement that the availability of drugs has not declined appreciably, the only explanation for these shifts is reduced demand.</p>
