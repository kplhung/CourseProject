        <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, called today for a re-examination of the nation's role in peacekeeping missions around the world and said it was time to consider recalling American ground troops from Kosovo and Bosnia.</p>
        <p>''I think it is important that we make sometimes difficult choices about when we're going to actually use military force, that we need to avoid situations where we commit troops because we can't think of anything else to do,'' said Mr. Cheney, who was the secretary of defense during the Persian Gulf war. ''The difficult part is deciding what's in our strategic interest, what's of sufficient significance in terms of U.S. interests so its worth the commitment of resources and the potential loss of American lives. And not every problem around the world is.''</p>

        <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, called today for a re-examination of the nation's role in peacekeeping missions around the world and said it was time to consider recalling American ground troops from Kosovo and Bosnia.</p>
        <p>''I think it is important that we make sometimes difficult choices about when we're going to actually use military force, that we need to avoid situations where we commit troops because we can't think of anything else to do,'' said Mr. Cheney, who was the secretary of defense during the Persian Gulf war. ''The difficult part is deciding what's in our strategic interest, what's of sufficient significance in terms of U.S. interests so its worth the commitment of resources and the potential loss of American lives. And not every problem around the world is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney made the comments after being asked by reporters today to elaborate on a speech he delivered in Atlanta on Wednesday in which he said that the military had been ''overused and underresourced'' during the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>The speech drew an angry response from Vice President Al Gore's campaign, which called Mr. Cheney's approach ''irresponsible,'' and it was sharply questioned at the White House as well.</p>
        <p>Joe Lockhart, a spokesman for President Clinton, said that Mr. Cheney ''now has an obligation to come forward and say which deployments he was opposed to.''</p>
        <p>''Was he against our action in Haiti?'' Mr. Lockhart asked. ''Was he against our action of returning peace to Sarajevo and Bosnia? Was he against reversing ethnic cleansing in Kosovo? Was he against eight years of containment of Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction? I think those are questions he should answer.''</p>
        <p>As the Bush and Gore campaigns continued to debate military preparedness today, the Pentagon released a quarterly report that found most of the nation's combat forces ready to perform their wartime missions.</p>
        <p>''America's armed forces remain capable'' of achieving the military goals of the Clinton administration, the report stated.</p>
        <p>But the report supported Mr. Cheney's claims that the armed forces face shortages in personnel, training problems and aging equipment. It also warned that an inadequate capability to move, protect and supply forces meant that higher casualties might occur should the United States be forced to fight two major conflicts at the same time, as called for in the national war plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney did not spell out a specific doctrine that he and Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, would follow if they won the election. But he called for applying a more rigorous standard of whether United States military intervention was warranted before committing troops to the field.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes,'' he said, ''I think we get into a situation where we have, because of the publicity given to a particular event -- you may have a real tragedy unfolding someplace in the world, but it doesn't affect vital U.S. interests.</p>
        <p>And you have to make a decision that you'll do whatever you can diplomatically, working through the international community or perhaps providing sustenance and medical supplies and support for humanitarian purposes, but you're not going to commit U.S. troops to combat to deal with that particular situation. Those are choices that presidents get paid to make. They are not easy choices. If they were, they wouldn't land on his desk.''</p>
        <p>Without addressing the merits of the Clinton administration's initial decision to send troops into Bosnia and Kosovo, Mr. Cheney said today that it was time to consider pulling the remaining American ground troops out of the Balkans, perhaps while still keeping a small presence there to gather intelligence and help the remaining international force with logistics.</p>
        <p>''We might continue to do that,'' he said. ''But troops on the ground, in Europe, in the Balkans in particular, now that the crisis supposedly has passed in Bosnia and Kosovo, strikes me an appropriate role for our European friends and allies.''</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign was quick to note that the United States has already sharply scaled back the number of troops it has on the ground in the Balkans. Kym Spell, a Gore campaign spokeswoman, said American troops accounted for 14 percent of the force in Kosovo and 18 percent of the force in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>''Dick Cheney's approach would be irresponsible,'' Ms. Spell said. ''It would leave our allies in the lurch, erase the progress we've made toward peace, and only cost the United States in the long run.''</p>
        <p>The one deployment that Mr. Cheney said he disagreed with was the mission in Haiti in 1994, but he did not specify why. The Clinton administration sent 20,000 troops into Haiti as part of an international force that restored to power the country's democratically elected president after he was ousted in a military coup. About 75 American troops remain in Haiti today, on a temporary mission to provide humanitarian aide.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spell said the vice president stood by the administration's decision to send troops to Haiti.</p>
        <p>''We went into Haiti to begin the process of defeating a dictator and restoring a democratically elected president,'' Ms. Spell said. ''We inherited the situation and showed the resolve and took the initiative to help the people of Haiti. Working to restore democracy is never a bad decision.''</p>
        <p>And although Mr. Cheney has criticized cutbacks in the size of the military repeatedly in recent days, culminating with his speech in Atlanta, in his remarks today he did not call for increasing the size of the armed forces.</p>
        <p>''I'm not ready to say that yet,'' said Mr. Cheney, who began the cutbacks as secretary of defense, reducing the military by a quarter after the end of the cold war.</p>
        <p>''I think we'd want to do a broad strategic review of our overall posture with respect to the kind of defense planning guidance that's out there now.'' he said. ''Then you'd have to size the force to execute the strategy.''</p>
