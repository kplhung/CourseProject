        <p>A 54-year-old jewelry store owner was fatally shot in a holdup in Bayside, Queens, yesterday by a man who fled in a car, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The victim, Fausto Rodriguez, was behind the counter at Jilliann's Jewelry at 210-17 Horace Harding Expressway around 4 p.m. when a man in his mid-20's came in, said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney.</p>
        <p>The man browsed among the jewelry and handbags until another customer left, then announced a holdup and led Mr. Rodriguez into a back room, Mr. Brown said. It was not clear whether Mr. Rodriguez resisted, but the man shot him about four times, including once in the face, Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>The robber also put a gun to the head of Mr. Rodriguez's wife as he tried to leave. But the gunman fled after the woman let him out of the locked store, and she was not hurt in the holdup.</p>
