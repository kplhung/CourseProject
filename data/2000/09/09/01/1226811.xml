      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>There was joy in local gyms and skywriting over Manhattan when the New York Knicks drafted Patrick Ewing in 1985 in the hope of bringing the National Basketball Association championship back to Madison Square Garden. Fifteen years later the Ewing championship has failed to materialize, and though he may yet remain in New York, the team is preparing for a divorce from one of the most durable and influential players in franchise history. Ewing's eagerness to go elsewhere is understandable, given the drubbing he has endured for failing to win that elusive N.B.A. championship. But the failure to win it is attributable less to Ewing than to the coaches who misused him and to the executives who failed to provide him with a credible supporting cast until too late in his career.</p>
        <p>Ewing emerged from college as an excellent defensive player with limited offensive skills. Instead of playing to his strengths, however, the Knicks made him the centerpiece of an unimaginative offense that consisted of four players who stood around watching him dribble and shoot. The strategy created a team of bit players who seemed at a loss to act when the star was swarmed under and shut down during the playoffs. The rap on Ewing was that he demanded the ball. But no player could really do that unless backed up by the coaches.</p>

        <p>There was joy in local gyms and skywriting over Manhattan when the New York Knicks drafted Patrick Ewing in 1985 in the hope of bringing the National Basketball Association championship back to Madison Square Garden. Fifteen years later the Ewing championship has failed to materialize, and though he may yet remain in New York, the team is preparing for a divorce from one of the most durable and influential players in franchise history. Ewing's eagerness to go elsewhere is understandable, given the drubbing he has endured for failing to win that elusive N.B.A. championship. But the failure to win it is attributable less to Ewing than to the coaches who misused him and to the executives who failed to provide him with a credible supporting cast until too late in his career.</p>
        <p>Ewing emerged from college as an excellent defensive player with limited offensive skills. Instead of playing to his strengths, however, the Knicks made him the centerpiece of an unimaginative offense that consisted of four players who stood around watching him dribble and shoot. The strategy created a team of bit players who seemed at a loss to act when the star was swarmed under and shut down during the playoffs. The rap on Ewing was that he demanded the ball. But no player could really do that unless backed up by the coaches.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Chicago Bulls, instead of standing pat with Michael Jordan, brought in Scottie Pippin and a raft of supporting players who propelled the Bulls to six championships. Meanwhile, the Knicks' front office stumbled through a series of unfortunate trades and draft choices that occasionally brought strong players but left the team and its strategy essentially unchanged.</p>
        <p>As the star with the big paycheck, Ewing has been a convenient target for these failures. His stoic style, which strikes many people as surly, has also left him exposed. But the blame for the missing championship rests elsewhere.</p>
