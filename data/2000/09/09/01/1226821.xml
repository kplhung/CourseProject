        <p>A government-sponsored inquiry into whether Liechtenstein is a center for money laundering found today that there were shortcomings in how the principality handles the problem.</p>
        <p>Liechtenstein's justice system has been at a ''partial deadlock,'' with some cases sitting idle for years, and its assistance to prosecutors in other countries has almost ground to a standstill, a special prosecutor, Kurt Spitzer, said today.</p>
        <p>Criminal proceedings remained unprocessed for years, hampered by factors like judges' inaction and failures to respond to requests for investigations and searches, said Mr. Spitzer, a prosecutor in Austria. In some cases, any possibility of prosecution was eliminated because so much time had elapsed.</p>
        <p>The principality of 32,000 people between Switzerland and Austria asked Mr. Spitzer to examine allegations that Colombian drug cartels, a Sicilian Mafia group and Russian criminal gangs were laundering money by passing funds through Liechtenstein asset managers and its 300 banks. In the spring, Liechtenstein was listed as one of 15 countries that had failed to cooperate in fighting laundering. Last month, millions of dollars linked to Sani Abacha, the late Nigerian dictator, were traced to its banks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer shook up the clubby atmosphere when he had documents seized from the bank owned by the realm's royal family. The brother of the deputy prime minister and a member of Parliament were detained for questioning.</p>
        <p>But in his report, Mr. Spitzer found that white-collar crime in Liechtenstein was ''no different'' from elsewhere in Europe. ''Most assets that wound up in the principality to be laundered have already undergone a prewash in other countries,'' he said. ''This ought to serve as a reminder to those countries which are now pointing the finger at the principality.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Mario Frick of Liechtenstein acknowledged blunders in pursuing illegal assets but said the report showed that ''Liechtenstein is not and never has been a criminal state.''</p>
        <p>Liechtenstein has become a wealthy enclave by exploiting its status as an offshore banking center. But pressures from the United States and European countries forced the country in July to abandon its system of anonymous accounts.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 8, 2000, Friday  An article on Friday about an inquiry into money laundering in Liechtenstein misstated the number of banks there. Sixteen are licensed, and 14 are operating; the number is not 300.</p>
