        <p>THERE are days when an adult goes to work and just doesn't feel like being there. We all have them, the acceptance of the mind's giving in to distraction and the body's surrender to fatigue. The person in the cubicle next door does better, and you realize you could not do a darn thing about it.</p>
        <p>Andre Agassi bombed out of the United States Open yesterday and sounded like he could not do a darned thing about it.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry you lost,'' someone told him after he fell in straight sets to the Frenchman Arnaud Clement, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.</p>
        <p>The guy was just being courteous, given the magnitude of the upset and the tumultuous state of Agassi's family life, the breast cancer that has afflicted his mother, Elizabeth, and sister, Tammee.</p>
        <p>''Don't be too sorry,'' said Agassi, quite politely.</p>
        <p>While we could only speculate that Agassi played with a heavy heart, we watched him maneuver on leaden legs. The man who has smoked the angriest forehands tennis has seen played a shockingly flat-footed match, which you can get away with when you serve aces, the way Pete Sampras does.</p>
        <p>What went on him first, mind or body, only Agassi knew, but as he said earlier in the week, ''I think the more toll you take on your body, the more difficult it is for you to stay hungry.''</p>
        <p>This was a distant and defensive Agassi, nothing resembling the tiger who showed up in Harare, Zimbabwe, the first week in February, riding a tidal wave of energy from Melbourne, where he had claimed the Australian Open title. It was his third Grand Slam title in four events. His 30th birthday only weeks away, Agassi had achieved a modern tennis miracle, reinventing himself, better than ever, at an age most peers were on the way out, if not already gone.</p>
        <p>A few of us covering that Davis Cup event, John McEnroe's debut as captain, watched Agassi practice that week -- shirtless, of course -- at the Harare Sports Center, and everyone had the same reaction to how ferociously Agassi was striking the ball. Even McEnroe was amazed, and he was the guy who said, after being confronted by the teenage hairball in 1986 at Stratton Mountain, Vt., ''I've never seen anyone hit it that hard.'' Unfortunately for Agassi, the last we saw of him after he won his second match in Harare's heat and thin air, he was doubled over, vomiting into a flowerpot. He went home under medical supervision, and that was the breaking of his wave. ''That's not an opinion,'' he agreed. ''All you have to do is look at the results. I had a couple of semis, and that's it.''</p>
        <p>Throughout Agassi's career, he has played to extremes, going way beyond the proverbial bad stretch to the complete bottoming out. ''When I'm in it, I go hard,'' he said, before opining, half-jokingly, that he has lasted this long because ''I take off every other year.''</p>
        <p>Lightweight critics have made a constant target of Agassi for not meeting their expectations of what his career should be, for not being Sampras. Yet Agassi always seemed to be a more complex personality, with a taxing baseline style that made the early retiree out of no less a champion than Bjorn Borg.</p>
        <p>Sampras compared Agassi's family situation to his playing through the illness and passing of his coach, Tim Gullikson. Who can say how these things affect people, on any given day? Yesterday, 17-year-old Jelena Dokic easily won her match 24 hours after her father was physically removed from the premises. Maybe Agassi's family situation weighed him down. Maybe it contributed, less than Clement, to a bad day at the office. Maybe it was just one of those late afternoons when Agassi stepped into the energy-challenged Arthur Ashe Stadium to feel the humid air and the blazing sun and soon knew in his heart, mind and legs that the guy across the net was going to do better.</p>
        <p>''I don't think he came in here with the expectation of being able to impose his will on his opponents,'' said Perry Rogers, Agassi's business manager and close friend. ''He hasn't had the best summer.''</p>
        <p>Physically and emotionally, Rogers agreed. Agassi's commitment for the Olympics remains firm, Rogers said, but then, so was his promise to play the full year of Davis Cup, until the summer turned cold and he backed out on McEnroe last month in Spain.</p>
        <p>He's 30, and when he doesn't feel like going to work, he is rich enough not to have to. Agassi left the United States Open yesterday, trailed by his entourage, including Steffi Graf, and he seemed to take with him the aging athlete's blessing and his curse. The perspective on how defeat should fit into his life.</p>
