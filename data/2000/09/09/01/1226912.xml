        <p>Hyung Taik Lee's unlikely odyssey from obscurity to the third round of the United States Open began on Aug. 11, in the middle of the night, driving from Binghamton to the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Lee, a 24-year-old resident of Seoul, South Korea, lost in the quarterfinals of a Binghamton challenger and drove all night so he could enter the qualifying of the GHI Bronx Tennis Classic the next day.</p>
        <p>Lee lost in the third round of that qualifier. But he got into the main draw of the Bronx tournament as a lucky loser and has not lost since, capping nine straight victories yesterday by beating 13th-seeded Franco Squillari of Argentina, 7-6 (7-3), 7-5, 6-2.</p>
        <p>Lee, who entered the Open qualifying ranked No. 181 in the world, has beaten David Wheaton, the 1991 Wimbledon semifinalist, and Jeff Tarango, an American Olympian,  during his streak.</p>
        <p>After winning the Bronx Tennis Classic, Lee went to Queens the next day to enter the Open's qualifying tournament.</p>
        <p>He beat Wheaton, now No. 320, in the second round and then won his third match to qualify for the main draw. Tuesday, Lee defeated No. 78-ranked Tarango and then yesterday beat Squillari. Lee is the first man from South Korea to make it to the third round of a Grand Slam tournament.</p>
        <p>Not only is Lee's victory streak remarkable, so is his windfall. Entering the Open qualifier, he had only won $26,316 this year, including the $7,200 he won at the Bronx. Even if Lee loses to No. 68 Rainer Schuttler, who downed No. 38 Tommy Haas, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 6-4, Lee will win more than he has earned this year: a $35,000 payout.</p>
        <p>The journey continues.</p>
