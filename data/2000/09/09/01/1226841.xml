        <p>France Proposes Tax Cuts Of $16 Billion Over 3 Years  Nudged by Germany, and probably providing an example to Italy, France became the second of Continental Europe's big three economies to propose a large package of tax cuts.</p>
        <p>The proposal, totaling $16 billion over three years, is part of a wave of similar measures being enacted across Europe as governments react to increased tax revenue because of expanding economies and declining unemployment. The cuts, while differing by country, are intended to give a measure of stability to a tenuous spurt of economic growth. [Page A12.]</p>
        <p>Main Stock Gauges Post Solid Gains  Stocks advanced on new signs that interest rates could remain steady. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 112.09 points, or 1 percent, to 11,215.10. The Nasdaq composite index soared 102.54 points, or 2.5 percent, to 4,206.35. And the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 15.09 points, or 1 percent, to 1,517.68. [C6.]</p>
        <p>2 Top Nordstrom Executives Resign  After several years of anemic sales growth at Nordstrom, John Whitacre, the company's chairman and chief executive, and Michael A. Stein, the chief financial officer, resigned. Two members of the Nordstrom family, which controls roughly one-third of the company's stock, have been named to key executive positions. Blake W. Nordstrom, 39, will be president, while Bruce A. Nordstrom, 66, will be chairman. Shares of Nordstrom fell $1.13, to $17.25. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Clinton Vetoes Repeal of Estate Tax  President Clinton vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill to repeal the federal estate tax and stepped up the election-year debate over tax cuts and how best to spend the budget surplus. He accused Republicans of threatening to hamstring the economy by devising tax cuts that he said would leave little money for Medicare, a prescription drug benefit, education and a host of other programs.

        <p>F.C.C. Eases Radio Spectrum Limits  In a move that may stimulate development of wireless products for the home, the Federal Communications Commission eased restrictions on part of the radio spectrum. The change affects an area used by companies that produce wireless local-area networks, which enable people to transmit data from, say, a laptop computer to a desktop computer -- or from either to a printer -- without wires. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Plan to Cut European Trading Costs  In a move intended to shore up support for the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges, the clearinghouses for the two markets introduced a plan that would cut settlement costs for certain trades. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Volkswagen Raises Pay in Mexico  Workers at Volkswagen Mexico negotiated a raise of more than double the inflation rate, ending a two-week battle that included a walkout at the only factory in the world that produces the trendy Beetles. The company agreed to raise salaries 13 percent and give workers a 5 percent productivity bonus plus a 3 percent increase in benefits. The union's general secretary, Jose Luis Rodriguez, said, ''We think that salaries should not be based on inflation, but the performance of the workers and the results of the company.'' [A4.]</p>
        <p>Factory Orders Fell 7.5% in July  Orders placed with manufacturers fell 7.5 percent in July, the largest drop on record, government figures showed, and private survey data indicated that manufacturing in the Chicago region contracted in August. [C17.]</p>
