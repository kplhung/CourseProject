        <p>As its scientific name Callinectes sapidus (delicious beautiful swimmer) suggests, the blue crab is a tasty creature, often winding up in delicacies like Maryland crab cakes, crab-and-avocado salads and ''she-crab soup.'' Although blue crabs are most often associated with the Chesapeake Bay, they have lesser known digs in New York City. Commercial crabbers pull 800,000 blue crabs out of city waters every year. And amateur crabbers can be found all summer on the city's piers and bridges, dangling traps into bays and inlets.</p>
        <p>For years we've observed this fishy phenomenon and wondered, are local crabs good to eat? Would we be able to catch any? This summer we decided to find out whether we could trap a free seafood dinner in New York City.</p>
        <p>Before putting on our bibs, we check on the edibility status of city crabs. The state Department of Health puts out an advisory on recreational fishing, and while it issues cautions about eating crabs from certain areas of the city, crabs caught south of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge on the southern shores of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island get a nod of approval. The only caveat is that they be properly cleaned before eating.</p>
        <p>We focus our crabbing efforts on Jamaica Bay, between Brooklyn and Queens, because it is in the safe zone, and it also offers a perfect habitat for blue crabs. With 28 square miles of shallow waters, flushed by ocean tides twice a day, it is a mini-Chesapeake as far as crabs are concerned.</p>
        <p>Our first stop is Smitty's Fishing Station in Broad Channel, Queens. On a dock on Jamaica Bay, Smitty's looks out over green marshes and blue water, as well as the causeway carrying the A train, which clatters by every few minutes. Most people go to Smitty's to rent motor boats for fishing, but we're here to see the owner, Dolores D'Ambrosio, the queen of Queens crabbing.</p>
        <p>Mrs. D'Ambrosio, 57, knows where to find them, when to catch them and how to cook them. Her husband, Jimmy, who died last year, had a commercial crabbing license, and she proudly displays a photo of his boat crammed with 2,000 blue crabs netted from pier pilings.</p>
        <p>We ask Mrs. D'Ambrosio if she ever worries about eating seafood from the bay. She doesn't.</p>
        <p>''I've been eating fish out of the waters of Jamaica Bay my whole life,'' she says. ''The crabs are sweet and delicious. You take the crabs, boil them with beer and bay leaf and garlic, bang them out and eat them. You will say, 'How did I ever eat other fish before?' I also make a red sauce with plum tomatoes, garlic and olive oil. I add the crab and let it cook. The only difference between a Maryland crab and a crab from Jamaica Bay is the way it's prepared.''</p>
        <p>Cruising the bay in a boat and using a long-handled net, she says, is the most efficient method of catching the crabs. But we tell her we're too landlubbery for that, so she sells us a crab trap and line for $8 and advises throwing it off a pier or bridge.</p>
        <p>''Just sit the cage on the bottom of the bay with chicken or fish in it,'' she says, ''and lift up every now and then.'' The legal limit for recreational crabbers is 50 a day, but we probably won't have to worry about going over. ''If you're out for five hours with the trap, you might catch six to eight,'' Mrs. D'Ambrosio tells us.</p>
        <p>The crab-o-ganza begins the next day at noon, when we head for the Canarsie Pier, a fishing hot spot on the Brooklyn side of Jamaica Bay. On the way we pick up a 10-pack of raw chicken wings from Key Food and a bucket in which to store the huge mess of crabs we plan to catch. (Since both of us were born under the sign Cancer, we figure we'll have a bit of an edge with our crab brothers.)</p>
        <p>Run by the National Park Service, Canarsie Pier is a huge concrete-and-wood structure that juts out 600 feet into Jamaica Bay. A walk around the pier reveals more than a hundred anglers -- mostly fishing for fluke (summer flounder) and snappers (young bluefish) -- but only one crabber. He's working five traps attached by lines to the pier railing, and he pulls a huge blue crab out of the water right as we're passing.</p>
        <p>We figure this is a good spot and unwrap our crab trap, which reveals itself to be a clever piece of technology. A small wire cage, it has two doors that snap shut when you pull a string at the top and that open when the tension is released.</p>
        <p>We introduce ourselves to the crabber, whose name is Joe Busuttil, and ask him how our trap looks. He says it is set up properly but that it is a poor style. Ideally, he says, it should have four doors, so the crabs can get at the bait from any direction.</p>
        <p>Then he studies our bait. ''You're using chicken?'' he asks. ''Where's the mashed potatoes?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Busuttil's own traps, which he constructed himself, are baited with tiny silver fish, and his bucket, an industrial size container that originally held potato salad, contains eight feisty crabs.</p>
        <p>He jiggles the bucket and the olive-green crabs rattle their claws. ''These are all males,'' he says. It's illegal to keep females with eggs, he informs us, and gingerly flips over one crab to show us how to tell the males from the females. A marking on the crab's white underside is shaped like the Washington Monument, designating its malehood. The female's marking is rounded and looks like the dome of the Capitol.</p>
        <p>Once we tie on our crab line, we chuck our trap tentatively into the drink. It plops down a few feet from the pier and sinks to the bottom. Mr. Busuttil's throwing style is more elegant, and he has a powerful arm. After a brief windup, he pitches the trap out over 25 feet of water. With five cages he is constantly in motion, either reeling them in, throwing them out or coaxing crabs from the traps into his bucket.</p>
        <p>We check our trap every five minutes, but the chicken wing remains untouched. After an hour and a half, we still haven't caught anything.</p>
        <p>A passing fisherman offers a tip. ''Leave the chicken out to stink a bit,'' he says. ''Let it rot, so the crabs can smell it. If you died and fell in, it would take a while for the crabs to start eating you.''</p>
        <p>Point taken. We put two chicken wings in the sun to fester and add a castoff fish head to our trap to make a tasty surf-and-turf mix.</p>
        <p>The time begins to drag. But maybe we shouldn't complain. The anglers are having a tough day, too. A man nearby just caught an empty Pepsi can.</p>
        <p>We consult a set of tide charts but realize we have no idea how the tides affect crabbing. Everyone we talk to offers a different theory about whether high tide, low tide or something in between is best. But the consensus is that you have to put in a full day if you want dinner.</p>
        <p>We meet another crabber, George Cintron, a low-tide man, who has shown up with wire-mesh nets baited with bunker, an oily bait fish. ''Bunker has more flavor than chicken,'' he tells us. ''More blood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cintron lives in Brownsville, just a few miles away, but to reach the pier, he has to take the subway, then a bus. Sometimes, on the way home, he'll lug as many as 35 live crabs through the transit system. The crabs, which ride free of charge, wind up boiled with sazon, a Spanish spice mixture.</p>
        <p>Although cooking is a moot point right now since we have no crabs, we ask Mr. Busuttil how he prepares his catch, and he tell us he likes crab pasta. ''You cook the spaghetti halfway,'' he says. ''Then you add the spaghetti and the crabs to tomato sauce. You cook it all together until the crabs turn red. It makes an unbelievable sauce.'' When he goes home to nearby Gerritsen Beach with  more than a dozen crabs we claim his spot.</p>
        <p>But his luck has left with him. Passers-by keep stopping to look inside our bucket. Nothing.</p>
        <p>A crusty old pier denizen comes over and says: ''What did you catch? A cold?''</p>
        <p>To kill time and distance ourselves from the empty pail, we retreat to a bench and play a word game. One of us chooses a letter of the alphabet, and then we have to think of three ''celebrities of the sea'' beginning with that letter. We start with S: salmon, squid and scungilli. P: porgie, porpoise and pilot whale. L: lamprey, limpet and lobster. Q: quahog, Queequeg and the QE2. It's time to check the traps.</p>
        <p>We pull the salty, wet line from the water and this time we see something with the chicken on the trap's floor. It's a crab waving its claws. And it's a Washington Monument! We wrestle it into our bucket and look it over proudly. It has 10 legs, two of them sturdy claws handsomely decorated with blue markings. And it's very feisty, scrambling to get out of the bucket and pinch someone. It's perfect, our first Canarsie crab.</p>
        <p>But our triumph comes late in the day. We need at least eight crabs to make a decent meal, and after another hour of crabless crabbing we conclude that there's no chance we'll catch enough by dinnertime. So at 4 p.m. we give our sole crab to Mr. Cintron and head home.</p>
        <p>Analyzing the situation, we decide we need more traps. We also consult the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Beautiful Swimmers'' by William W. Warner (Little, Brown, 1976), a book about the commercial blue-crab fishery in the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
        <p>We learn that commercial crabbers call amateurs chicken neckers because they bait their cages with chicken necks, which makes us chicken wingers. We decide to switch bait.</p>
        <p>The next morning we're back in Canarsie at the Seaview Deli and Grocery, which sells fishing gear on Rockaway Parkway a few blocks from the Canarsie Pier. We buy another cage-style trap and a ring net like Mr. Cintron's along with bunker for bait.</p>
        <p>It's all business when we hit the pier at 10:30 a.m. Within 10 minutes all three traps are baited and in the water.</p>
        <p>The first time we pull in the new net trap it comes up with a huge male crab. And it's no fluke because 10 minutes later we pull in another. Our crabbing fantasy has begun. We have visions of a feast: crab chowder, deviled-crab tarts and leftover-crab sandwiches.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately our personal fishery abruptly shifts to the crabber set up next to us. Over the next two hours his traps (which are baited with chicken) come up with crab after crab. Meanwhile we catch two small females, which we throw back.</p>
        <p>As the day slowly goes by, and we work the traps regularly, our catch does become respectable. Over six hours we pull in nine crabs, a few of them with shells measuring more than six inches across. Our bucket even begins to draw admiring glances.</p>
        <p>On the way home the crabs ride on the floor of the passenger seat. They're mostly quiet, but we can occasionally hear them fighting in the bucket. We feel a bit guilty about removing them from their briny home in Canarsie. At the same time we feel hungry. Besides, blue crabs eat blue crabs. According to studies, as much as 13 percent of their diet is cannibalistic.</p>
        <p>Back at our test kitchen we debate how to cook them. The voices of Mrs. D'Ambrosio, Mr. Cintron and Mr. Busuttil ring in our ears. Red sauce, whisper Mrs. D'Ambrosio and Mr. Busuttil. Boil them, urges Mr. Cintron. We search epicurious.com, but its recipes are too elaborate (miniature crab cakes with mustard mayonnaise).</p>
        <p>Finally we check the ''Long Island Seafood Cook Book,'' originally published in 1939, which has 16 localized crab recipes, including ''Savory Crab Rockaway Beach,'' ''Crab Curry Hempstead'' and ''Great Neck Baked Crab Shells.'' In the end we modify the cook book's simplest recipe: the ''Crab Boil.''</p>
        <p>Using two-foot-long tongs we transfer the live crabs to a pot and rinse them off under cold water. Then we put another pot of water on the stove and throw in salt, pepper, a tablespoon of vinegar, half a chopped onion, two cloves of garlic, a bay leaf, one chopped chili pepper and a bottle of Brooklyn Lager.</p>
        <p>When the water reaches a rolling boil, we lift up the pot of crabs and pour them in, covering the pot with a lid to avoid seeing the carnage. Thirty seconds later we peek, and the crabs have turned from olive brown to bright pinkish red. It looks as if our little friends have headed for the big Red Lobster in the sky.</p>
        <p>As the crabs simmer, we cover the kitchen table with sheets of newspaper. In 15 minutes our catch is done. Prying the crabs apart, we remove the goopy, greenish yellow viscera (called the liver or tomalley), as well as the thin, tubelike gills.</p>
        <p>We stack the crabs on the table. Using nutcrackers, we extract the white meat from the claws and bodies and crack the smaller legs with our teeth, sucking the juicy flesh out. As we get more involved in cracking and slurping, the seaside aroma of the crabs is almost intoxicating. Canarsie crab is the sweetest we've ever tasted.</p>
        <p>Limit Is 50 a Day</p>
        <p>The crabbing action at the Canarsie Pier in Brooklyn extends through the end of September. To reach the pier by car, take the Belt Parkway to Exit 13 (Rockaway Parkway) and follow the signs. Free parking is available. By mass transit, take the L train to Rockaway Parkway and transfer to the B42 bus. The pier is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Information: (718) 763-2202.</p>
        <p>Crab traps, lines and bait can be purchased near the pier at the Seaview Deli and Grocery, 2126 Rockaway Parkway, Canarsie, Brooklyn, (718) 251-1303. Jamaica Bay motor boat rentals and crabbing gear are available at Smitty's Fishing Station, at East Ninth and Lanark Roads, Broad Channel, Queens, (718) 945-2642.</p>
        <p>No license is required for recreational crabbing. But the state Department of Environmental Conservation sets a limit of catching 50 crabs a day, and all females caught with eggs must be released.</p>
        <p>The state Department of Health recommends that crabs caught in Jamaica Bay be properly cleaned before eating. Specifically, the hepatopancreas (tomalley, or greenish yellow viscera), where any contaminants would be concentrated, should be completely removed. Further details and information on eating crabs caught in other city waterways is available from (800) 458-1158, extension 27815, or on the Web at www.health.state.ny.us/  nysdoh/environ/fish.htm.</p>
