        <p>Amazon.com, the No. 1 Internet retailer, has revised its privacy policy, and in doing so has provided a window into how much it uses the customer data it collects to help it and other companies sell more. In the new policy, Amazon disclosed that it has started sending e-mail marketing messages on behalf of other companies. It also added a long list of data it collects about users, including financial information, Social Security numbers, product searches and the telephone number from which a user calls Amazon's customer service line. And for the first time, Amazon disclosed it can buy information about customers from outside databases. And if the new initiatives do not help stem Amazon's huge losses and the company is put up for sale, the new policy says, anyone who buys Amazon will get its customer data.</p>
