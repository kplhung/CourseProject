        <p>WALKING around the National Tennis Center during the United States Open this week, you may happen upon a 14-foot statue of a man, nude, rendered in heroic, classic style. His arm will be raised as if he is about to serve a tennis ball.</p>
        <p>The statue, by Eric Fischl, is a tribute to the late tennis champion Arthur Ashe, though it bears no likeness.</p>
        <p>''It's a representation, but not a representation of Ashe,''  says Mr. Fischl, 52, an agreeably rumpled fellow, in the large TriBeCa studio that signals a very successful artist -- or one who's been at it a long time. ''It remembers and honors him. There are different ways you can do that. There's a spirit in which I remember him, his energy. It's those intangibles which do not necessarily show up on the face.''</p>
        <p>We deal now with the question of representation: What does it mean that the artist is yawning and will yawn more and more, as questions grow increasingly personal? Tired, Mr. Fischl says, it was a late night. Do we take this at face value? If we had a picture, would we call it ''Man Weary After the Unveiling of his Arthur Ashe Statue,'' or would we speak, as many do with Mr. Fischl's work, of the tensions lurking beneath the pleasant surface?</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischl, at any rate, is a star. He hit it in the early 80's with his figurative paintings, many of which involved disturbing sexual and social images in the supposedly safe setting of the suburbs. Mr. Fischl knew the suburbs, having been a Port Washington kid. One of his most talked about early works was ''Bad Boy,'' in which a woman lies naked on her bed while a young man reaches surreptitiously into her purse. This year a painting, ''Noonwatch,'' sold for $1 million. Mr. Fischl and his wife, April Gornick, a highly regarded landscape artist, have a home in Sag Harbor and a duplex in the Village.</p>
        <p>This is all very impressive for someone, who, as Mr. Fischl says, ''wasn't a good kid.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischl's father was a salesman. His mother? A brief pause, then an equally brief description. ''Housewife.'' Mr. Fischl speaks of flunking out of his first college; of living as a hippie in San Francisco; of his parents moving to the Southwest. But what he seems to enjoy discussing most is his work. He speaks wryly of trends in the art world, dryly funny in the style of Steve Martin and Mike Nichols, who are collectors and friends. When Mr. Fischl talks art, it is often Art Forum sort of stuff:</p>
        <p>''I was of a mind that you could paint from experience towards experience.'' Something feels as if it's missing. Could he give us a better sense of his parents?</p>
        <p>The answer comes back so bluntly and directly it is like a shot.</p>
        <p>''My mother was a ferocious alcoholic who ultimately killed herself,'' Mr. Fischl says. ''My father was trying to hold the whole thing together as best he could. And they just had this incredibly intense, really horrible relationship. She died in a car accident -- went out extremely drunk, to run herself off the road. I was 22. She did not want to live. That's what I think.''</p>
        <p>WHY was Mr. Fischl's mother so unhappy?</p>
        <p>''Aha, the mystery of mysteries,'' Mr. Fischl says with a bitter and slightly unpleasant edge. ''I always thought she just lacked discipline. She was very creative and her fantasy of herself was as an artist, and she always approached everything as if it had to be a masterpiece or it wasn't worth doing. She tried everything: painting, sculpture, crafts, writing, but every time she put something out it was never good enough, it humiliated her.''</p>
        <p>The painting ''Bad Boy'' shows a boy seemingly taking money from a  purse. Was that boy ever Mr. Fischl?</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I stole money all the time.''</p>
        <p>The woman in the painting might, at first glance, be passed out. Did Mr. Fischl, as a boy, ever see his mother passed out on the bed?</p>
        <p>A nod of assent. ''Or on the floor or in the backyard or in the car, waiting to pick you up.''</p>
        <p>Would the artist speak about how this painting came to be?</p>
        <p>He will, and happily.</p>
        <p>''The painting 'Bad Boy' is probably the greatest journey I ever took, because I started out simply wanting to paint this bowl of fruit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischl describes the process. He paints a still life -- a bowl of fruit on a table -- then decides to put a phone on the table, then tries to figure out what sort of room to put the table in. Looking through a magazine, he sees a room with bamboo and decides those blinds would be fun to paint. He then paints the stripes the afternoon sun would make on the fruit.</p>
        <p>''The painting is starting to talk to me now,'' Mr. Fischl recalls, excited. ''It's talking to me about the time of day, I'm thinking Southwest, noon, siesta. I paint a man and a woman in a bed, but I can't really make the guy stick. It's not coming out right. I keep thinking there are two people in the room, maybe a small child. I put that in, but it doesn't work. Then I get this idea, maybe it's an older child, an 8-, 9- or 10-year-old boy. I put him in, I see him looking over his shoulder and realize that he's doing something. I change the telephone on the table to a purse and the painting is finished.''</p>
        <p>''Painting unlocks the unconscious; it's a process of free association. The painting has to talk to the artist. The artist goes to it with a certain amount of stuff just to get it going, but what you're looking for is the painting to tell you where to go. If the painting doesn't talk it's because it's not alive, it's dead.''</p>
