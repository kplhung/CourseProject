        <p>Brazil's Supreme Federal Tribunal ruled that the government is liable for about $21 billion in losses employees suffered to their Guarantee Fund for Length of Service -- a type of individual unemployment insurance fund -- during the late 1980's and early 1990's, when a series of unsuccessful economic plans threw the Brazilian economy into chaos. About 600,000 workers are affected by the court's decision to hold the government responsible for losses under two of the five economic plans. The exact amount will be decided later.</p>
