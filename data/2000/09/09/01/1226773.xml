        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>QUEEN ESTHER, Joe's Pub, Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. This artist exudes an impish charm that recalls the sorely missed comedian and performance artist Danitra Vance. But by the end of the show her musical identity remains undefined. Her nondescript versions of ''The Lady Is a Tramp'' and ''Lush Life'' fail to illuminate either the material or her ideas. And when she caps her show with two more vintage lounge songs, ''I've Gotta Be Me'' and ''The Good Life,'' it isn't clear whether she's making fun of them or embracing them. The best moments of her show, ''Unemployed Superstar,'' are its nonmusical monologues in which Queen Esther impersonates embittered neighbors she met when she moved to Harlem. Characters like these could form the basis of an unsettling evening of serious political comedy. Tonight and next Friday at 8:30. Tickets: $12 (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight and Monday through Wednesday nights at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.; Sunday night at 7:30. Tickets: $50 and $55; premium ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).</p>
        <p>MARC SALEM, Feinstein's, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Marc Salem is the mental magician who dazzled audiences at the Westside Theater with his 1997 show, ''Mind Games.'' Now Mr. Salem, accompanied by a trio of bass, piano and percussion, is in residence at Feinstein's with ''Mind Games and All That Jazz.'' But handsome as it is, Feinstein's at the Regency may not be the ideal setting for the display of Mr. Salem's enjoyable bag of tricks. The intimacy of Feinstein's, where Mr. Salem seems to be working with a smaller palette than at the Westside Theater, detracts from the aura of magic that can surround, say, a wristwatch that suddenly changes the time it displays. The jazz trio Vibrations, as pleasant and talented as it is, provides little more than a few attractive introductory numbers and a bit of musical commentary of the ''Twilight Zone'' sort. Nevertheless, Mr. Salem and his wizardry provide cool fun for hot summer nights. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $40 on weekends; no cover on weekdays; dinner required for early show on weekends, with seating beginning at 6; a la carte supper menu with $20 minimum for late show; $35 for early show; Sunday brunch is $30 and cover is $30. Through Sept. 9 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>

        <p>CARNEGIE CLUB, 156 West 56th Street, (212) 957-9676.
