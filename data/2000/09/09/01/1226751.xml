        <p>AN OBVIOUS ENCHANTMENT  By Tucker Malarkey  407 pages. Random House. $23.95.</p>
        <p>The enchantment in the title of this entertainingly piquant first novel by Tucker Malarkey comes from a line in the Koran and seems to refer to an attitude of nonbelief, an erroneous conviction that the faith of the ancestors is a sort of bedazzlement, a falsehood. But the phrase ''an obvious enchantment'' is also mysterious, elusive, suggestive of the world of uncertainty in which Ms. Malarkey places her likable heroine, an archaeologist-anthropologist named Ingrid Holtz who is a flickering column of light trying to penetrate the shadows of a world of exotic intrigue.</p>
        <p>Ingrid has garnered an academic grant allowing her to travel to the island of Pelat off the Indian Ocean coast of Kenya, where her academic mentor and adviser, Nick Templeton, has disappeared while doing research. Templeton is a rebel in the world of scholarship, a man who suspects that we have gotten the history of monotheism all wrong. He wants to answer the question of ''how cultures all around the world had all, in their own time and way, come to decide on one god.'' And he believes that part of the answer lies in rediscovering a long-ago native king who brought Islam to Africa three centuries before that event is believed to have occurred.</p>
        <p>Ingrid, too, is absorbed by the history of monotheism, and she is a believer in Templeton, who is mocked and despised by his colleagues at the University in Michigan, where he and Ingrid both work.</p>
        <p>Never mind that the academic questions seem a bit contrived, a bit airy, unconvincingly portentous. Never mind also that some of what happens in ''An Obvious Enchantment,'' including some of the critical turnings of plot, seem unmoored from clear and logical motivation. Ms. Malarkey never entirely solves the mysteries that get her into her African story in the first place. But she is a gifted writer with a keen sense of place and a basketful of aromatic characters, expatriates and Africans alike, who give her book plenty of romantic charm.</p>
        <p>The chief mystery has to do with Templeton's disappearance. Strangely, when Ingrid arrives on Pelat, he makes no effort to contact her there, or to let her know where he is, even though she has always been his star pupil and special moral and scholarly admirer. Why Templeton behaves so strangely is one of those matters never fully accounted for in Ms. Malarkey's scheme. Still, once you accept that Templeton has vanished and yet is present in the lives of the savory inhabitants of Pelat, you can enjoy Ingrid's adventurous efforts not only to find him but to puzzle out what he has discovered about the historical king.</p>
        <p>Along the way Ingrid unearths a host of others, dissolute, roguish, scheming, vulnerable, drunken and, in one case, unhealthily irresistible. This latter figure is Finn Bergmann, whose Scandinavian father, now dead, founded Salama, a luxurious hotel on Pelat where the island's chatty and catty expats gather.</p>
        <p>Finn is a white African. He fishes for a living and is a sort of male counterpart to a femme fatale. He is strong, handsome and seductive. But while he is willing to share Ingrid's eager bed he is unwilling to have sex with her. He also seems to know something important about Templeton, but he doesn't share this precious information with Ingrid, which makes her all the more annoyed that she can't get Finn out of her mind.</p>
        <p>''Her thoughts were clear,'' Ms. Malarkey's narrator intones. ''This man was a confused drunk, a fundamentally crippled human being. He could not think, feel or talk. She smiled as politely as she could. 'I'm sorry to have caught you in my confusion.'</p>
        <p>'' 'Don't concern yourself with my opinion of you,' Finn said. 'I have none.' ''</p>
        <p>Some of Ms. Malarkey's characters risk reminding one of central casting. What recent cultural product about whites in Africa, for example, does not have the equivalent of Ms. Malarkey's Danny Chisham, the man who drinks steadily at the Salama and has no purpose in life other than to be hurt and utter witticisms? Then there is Fatima, the cloaked Muslim woman whom we see striving to keep Finn from losing himself among these dissolute Europeans, as she intrigues from the shadows.</p>
        <p>The issue that concerns everybody -- and that Ingrid can't quite get a handle on -- has to do with a new hotel being built by another cagey expatriate, Stanley Wicks, on the other side of Pelat from the Salama. The first hotel, built by Finn's father, created an opposition group on the island, a kind of proto-fundamentalist core that feared the tourism business would pollute the native way of life, turning local boys into bartenders and bellhops. Now another eager European wants to bring more commercialism, more liquor, more European fashion to the very part of the island where the dissident faction lives.</p>
        <p>Somehow Templeton is involved with that faction and is opposed to the new hotel. Finn, too. But why can't anybody just tell the mystified Ingrid what is happening? In real life they might have, but then Ms. Malarkey wouldn't have had much of a story, and we would have been deprived of the entertainment she has given us.</p>
        <p>Ms. Malarkey's ending involves a kind of showdown among the contending parties. Again, the stakes, especially for the Europeans, do not seem quite large enough to justify the grisly acts that are committed, including some by Templeton, as the final battle is fought. But by then Ms. Malarkey has given us a savory, intimate dose of Africa and a main character whose combination of pluck and despair make us want to have as much of her as possible.</p>
        <p>''An Obvious Enchantment'' is far from entirely convincing, but its virtues are distinguished enough for us to keep reading with pleasure and a sense of edification about a faraway world that Ms. Malarkey has brought colorfully to life.</p>
