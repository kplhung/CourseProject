        <p>Both political parties launched advertising blitzes this week pledging that their candidates would help the elderly pay for costly prescription drugs more effectively. Vice President Al Gore has put forward a detailed plan for a Medicare drug benefit. Gov. George W. Bush is scrambling to produce a plan of his own to be unveiled next week.</p>
        <p>The need for a prescription drug benefit is undeniable. A third of Medicare's 40 million beneficiaries have no drug coverage at all, even though drug costs are soaring and drugs are now essential to managing chronic illnesses. At the same time, drug coverage for the elderly through other health plans is becoming more limited.</p>
        <p>The Gore plan would pay for all drug costs of elderly people with incomes below about $12,000 a year for an individual or $14,000 a year for couples. Those with higher incomes who choose to participate would pay monthly premiums that would start at $25 and increase over time to $44. In return, Medicare would pay for half the cost of their prescriptions up to $5,000 a year. Once a beneficiary had paid $4,000 out of pocket in a year, the government would pay all remaining costs. The program is estimated to cost $253 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said generally that he wants a drug benefit to be part of an overall Medicare reform. Ideally, Congress should both modernize Medicare -- by increasing competition, improving quality and controlling costs -- and create a long-overdue drug benefit. But given voter demand, it seems more likely that Congress will first pass a drug benefit and leave restructuring for later.</p>
        <p>The question is how to design a drug benefit that will provide affordable coverage and will not interfere with future Medicare reforms. Mr. Bush says he will offer full drug coverage now to the low-income elderly. He also says he will ''build on'' proposals in Congress that rely on private insurers to offer prescription drug coverage, with government subsidizing the costs. But many private insurers have rejected this approach as unworkable because they say they will not be able to sell policies at rates that retirees can afford. The private-market model also means that benefits would vary, and insurers would be able to pull out of any market they thought unprofitable.</p>
        <p>Any new drug benefit will carry a substantial price tag. The House Republican bill that passed in June and relies on private insurers would cost the federal government more than $150 billion over 10 years. Mr. Bush has not proposed spending any new money. His aides say that savings from other Medicare cuts could cover the tab, an unlikely proposition that Mr. Bush will need to document.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seems to be leaning toward a private-market model for Medicare drug coverage. He will have to explain how his plan would keep premiums down, induce insurer participation and guarantee the elderly benefits that cannot be withdrawn. Mr. Gore's proposal will spend substantial money on a new public program. It will be interesting to see how Mr. Bush hopes to achieve the same outcome with less government involvement and less money.</p>
