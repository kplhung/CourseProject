        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Arizona (6-10) at Giants (7-9)  Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer has 11 fourth-quarter comebacks in 36 career starts. His sometimes-electrifying play has made him one of the best young throwing talents in the game. But because of a bad thumb and even worse decisions, he tossed 24 interceptions last season. Looking to rebound immediately, he should pick apart a weak Giants secondary. But thSUNday 1 p.m.e Giants hold on in a high-scoring game because defensive end Michael Strahan will have three sacks and quarterback Kerry Collins will throw for more than 300 yards.  Giants, 35-28</p>
        <p>Baltimore (8-8) at Pittsburgh (6-10)  This game is perfect for Baltimore's excellent defense. Kent Graham is a solid passer, but his wide receivers are young. Because the Steelers' offensive chemistry might be off, the team will be susceptible to the blitz -- and the Ravens love to blitz. Middle linebacker Ray Lewis, who got through a murder trial mostly unscathed, wants to take out on opponents the pain of what he feels was an unfair prosecution. Quarterback Tony Banks will have a better game, and better season, than many think.  Ravens, 28-14</p>
        <p>Carolina (8-8) at Washington (10-6)  The Redskins have more big-time players than an N.B.A. All-Star Game. The problem with possessing all that talent is getting it all to mesh. There will be rough spots early in this game and early in the season. The Panthers might actually jump to a 10-6 halftime lead. But eventually all that talent will kick in, and the people who made the Redskins so good last year -- quarterback Brad Johnson, running back Stephen Davis and wide receiver Michael Westbrook -- will dominate a weak Panthers defense.  Redskins, 25-13</p>
        <p>Chicago (6-10) at Minnesota (10-6)  Please, everyone, relax about the Vikings' quarterback situation. Daunte Culpepper will be just fine. He can throw to the Hall-of-Famer Cris Carter and the brilliant Randy Moss. There will be bumps for Culpepper, but few quarterbacks have failed in Dennis Green's offensive system. Besides, to slow down Minnesota, a team has to have a great running game, and Chicago's Curtis Enis does not qualify.  Vikings, 28-17</p>
        <p>Detroit (8-8) at New Orleans (3-13)  Running back James Stewart is the key. Before he signed with the Lions as a free agent, Stewart had 13 rushing touchdowns for Jacksonville last season. In preseason he has displayed the kind of quickness and power Detroit had hoped for. He will stabilize what has been a chaotic situation with quarterback Charlie Batch, who is still recovering from a broken leg. His status as starter is still to be determined, and that delay always throws off game plans. Still, the Lions survive.  Lions, 24-10</p>
        <p>Indianapolis (13-3) at Kansas City (9-7)  This game will let the Colts know early the challenge that lies ahead. Knowing Indianapolis is a strong Super Bowl favorite, every team will play its best against the Colts. The Chiefs finished the preseason 0-4 but has won 8 of their last 10 regular-season games at home. Quarterback Peyton Manning wins this one in the final seconds.  Colts, 20-17</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville (14-2) at Cleveland (2-14)  Biggest mismatch of the weekend. The Browns have no chance, especially because quarterback Tim Couch, their savior, is playing poorly. Quarterback Mark Brunell should have a healthy set of statistics after this one, even though Courtney Brown, the No. 1 overall pick, might get to him a time or two.  Jaguars, 28-6</p>
        <p>San Francisco (4-12) at Atlanta (5-11)  The 49ers are fighting to avoid finishing last in the division, while the Falcons are fighting to get back to the playoffs. San Francisco is young and not very talented. Jeff Garcia is the first 49ers quarterback other than Joe Montana or Steve Young to start Week 1 since 1980. If preseason is any indication, and it most likely is, Garcia will be good for about two interceptions this game.  Falcons, 17-10</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay (11-5) at New England (8-8)  There should not be much suspense in who wins: the Buccaneers will, of course. What will be interesting is how well the offense blends with wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. During one preseason game, the Buccaneers ran the same play seven times -- a running play. Bland, bland, bland. But the team will open things up against New England, and Johnson will be the focal point. Will the team implode once Johnson begins demanding the ball? That is Tampa Bay's biggest question as the team makes a Super Bowl run.  Buccaneers, 19-7</p>
        <p>MONDAY 9 P.M.</p>
        <p>Denver (6-10) at St. Louis (13-3)  There will be times this season when the Rams feel the crush of being the defending Super Bowl champions. But not this game. On the surface, this seems a close matchup, but the Broncos don't have the speed to keep up with St. Louis on that slick artificial surface. Terrell Davis has bravely made the comeback from torn knee ligaments, but few players come back from those injuries quickly. Davis won't be his old self, so Denver will be forced to rely on quarterback Brian Griese, who is extremely inconsistent. This might be a blowout.  Rams, 30-21</p>
        <p>SUNDAY 4:05 P.M.</p>
        <p>Jets (8-8) at Green Bay (8-8)  Brett Favre did the right thing this week. He rested his tired throwing elbow, even though there is still a question of when his elbow problems will fire up again. Most likely that won't happen against the Jets. Actually, both the Packers and the Jets have problems at quarterback. Vinny Testaverde saw little action in preseason, which will surely affect his timing as well as his endurance. Because Favre is at home, he wins the battle.  Packers, 20-13</p>
        <p>Philadelphia (5-11) at Dallas (8-8)  Donovan McNabb finished the preseason with an 89.7 passer rating. The rest of the N.F.C. East should be getting a little nervous. The second-year quarterback is starting to get a good feel for the game. Throw in the talented runner Duce Staley, who accounted for 40.9 percent of the team's offense last season, and Philadelphia could end up steamrolling an aging Dallas team.  Eagles, 21-6</p>
        <p>San Diego (8-8) at Oakland (8-8)  Quarterback Ryan Leaf gets the start for the Chargers as his rebirth begins. Known more for being a crybaby than a professional thrower maybe Leaf can turn his career around. If that does happen, it won't start against the Raiders. Their secondary is pretty solid, so Leaf is likely to throw one or two interceptions. Oakland sticks to its excellent ground game and wears down the Chargers.  Raiders, 15-7</p>
        <p>Seattle (9-7) at Miami (9-7)  Perhaps the toughest game to call because both teams are so even. The edge probably goes to the Dolphins because they are at home and play so well in season openers. Also, Seattle quarterback Jon Kitna was disappointing in preseason.  Dolphins, 21-14</p>
        <p>Game of the Week</p>
        <p>Tennessee 13-3 Buffalo 11-5  Buffalo begins an extremely difficult first half of the season by playing nine teams that made last season's playoffs. This, of course, is a rematch of the ''Music City Miracle'' which was Tennessee's last-second kickoff runback in the playoffs last year that won the wildcard playoff game against the Bills. Though Buffalo plays well at home, the Titans won't stumble, mainly because the Bills don't have the run defense to stop Eddie George, who had 1,304 yards rushing last season. In the preseason it has sometimes taken four defenders to bring him down.  Titans, 28-21</p>
