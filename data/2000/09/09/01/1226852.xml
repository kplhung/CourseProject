        <p>Rarely has a leading global company faced such an extraordinary confluence of problems: its flagship product blamed for scores of deaths; its biggest customer undermining its every defense; its stock price plunging along with consumer confidence; its top executive summoned before an angry Congress.</p>
        <p>This is not how Firestone planned to celebrate its 100th birthday this summer. The centennial, some marketing experts say, has turned into a debacle for one of America's most familiar brand names.</p>
        <p>In Washington today, regulators added 26 deaths to the 62 previously attributed to failures of Firestone tires in the United States. In Venezuela, one of 17 countries where Firestone tires have been recalled, the government's consumer agency asked the state prosecutor to bring criminal charges against Firestone. It also called for prosecuting the Ford Motor Company, saying the design of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles that were equipped with Firestone tires contributed to dozens of deaths in crashes there.</p>
        <p>Until today, Ford officials insisted that their company would stand by Firestone as a supplier. But Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive, refused during a news conference in Dearborn, Mich., to reiterate that stance. ''This has been an extremely difficult and disappointing period in our relationship, and we'll take this a day at a time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Executives of Bridgestone/Firestone and its Japanese parent, the Bridgestone Corporation, insist the Firestone brand will survive. John Lampe, the American subsidiary's executive vice president, said here this morning that to restore customers' confidence, the company would soon appoint an independent investigator to look into the company's products and practices.</p>
        <p>But Firestone soon may face a fresh storm. As Mr. Lampe spoke in an interview at an airport hotel, angry union workers prepared to demonstrate in front of his company's American headquarters here. Close to 8,000 workers could go on strike Saturday morning at nine Firestone plants in the United States.</p>
        <p>Marketing experts are gloomy about Firestone's prospects. Tylenol survived a poisoning scare a decade ago. Ford survived the problem of Pintos that caught fire during collisions two decades ago. And Firestone itself survived a much larger recall of its Firestone 500 car tires in 1978.</p>
        <p>But now, under the unblinking glare of 24-hour news channels and the Internet, Firestone -- pilloried again as insufficiently concerned about safety -- is especially vulnerable because consumer loyalty to tire brands is weak, said Jack F. Trout, the president of a market research company that bears his name in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>''I think their chance of survival is certainly in question,'' Mr. Trout said. ''There might be irreparable damage to the brand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe said ''business was normal'' for tires not subject to the recall, but also noted that the recall was taking up mechanics' time and filling service bays, which would affect sales. General Motors repeated today that it had not found problems with Firestone tires and would keep buying them. But the costs of the recall and expectations of lower sales have knocked 45 percent off Bridgestone's stock price in Tokyo trading during August.</p>
        <p>Firestone had slowly gained market share over the last three years at the expense of its two global archrivals -- Goodyear and Michelin -- by heavily marketing the success of Firestone tires on the racetrack. Now its rivals are having their revenge. Goodyear, still the market leader in the United States, has just stepped up its advertising, particularly of tires for sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>''We have responded, we believe appropriately and effectively, to the market opportunities out there,'' said Chuck Sinclair, a Goodyear spokesman.</p>
        <p>The crashes involving the recalled tires -- 15-inch ATX and ATX II tires made anywhere in North America and 15-inch Wilderness models made only in Decatur, Ill. -- have occurred mainly in Sun Belt states. Tire dealers and customers in the region said today that consumer confidence in the Firestone brand had been shaken.</p>
        <p>''I want to get a different brand of tires,'' said Allison Leodler, a University of Texas student leaving a Firestone service center in Austin, explaining she had been waiting two weeks for replacement tires for her 1998 Explorer. ''It's been horrible. I canceled a trip to Houston to see my parents a few days ago because I'm scared to drive on the highway.''</p>
        <p>Understanding the tumult in the United States poses a special challenge for Bridgestone in Japan. People who follow the industry in Tokyo describe the parent company as lacking in public relations skill. ''Bridgestone has a tradition that 'no news is good news,' even when it's good news,'' said Roger Schreffler, a long-time auto journalist there.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone has no Americans on its board, even though half the company's sales are in the United States. Here in Nashville, 5 of the 10 corporate officers of Bridgestone/Firestone are Japanese. They handle  communications with Japan, said Mr. Lampe -- who, like most of the American executives, does not speak Japanese.</p>
        <p>Though analysts have viewed the tire maker's response to the recall as tin-eared and defensive -- especially in comparison with that of Ford, which has often released information as quickly as it obtains it from Firestone -- Mr. Lampe said that he did not believe that the company's foreign ownership had interfered at all with its handling of the crisis.</p>
        <p>Still, the timing of the recall could not be worse for Firestone's management. Since the early 1990's, the American operations have been led by two Japanese executives in close partnership. Kenji Shibata, the president, has overseen sales and marketing issues, while Masatoshi Ono, the chief executive, is an engineer who has handled manufacturing and technical issues.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Shibata, who speaks fluent English and sometimes served as an interpreter for fellow Japanese executives, retired in early July. Mr. Lampe described the retirement as unrelated to the recall, which began on Aug. 9, although federal regulators opened an investigation in May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shibata's retirement has left the many issues facing the company in the hands of Mr. Ono, who conducts meetings in English but is sometimes uncertain whether he understands all the nuances when asked questions in English, said Trevor Hoskins, a retired senior vice president of Bridgestone/Firestone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ono, who declined repeated requests this week for an interview, is scheduled to testify before the House Commerce Committee next week. Mr. Nasser, who earlier in the week turned down an invitation to testify, said today he had changed his mind -- but Congressional aides said he pointedly refused to appear on the same panel as Mr. Ono.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone has a reputation in Japan for an unyielding management style, especially compared with the more compromising approach of other Japanese multinationals.</p>
        <p>A former executive told a Japanese newspaper that the first Japanese word that the company's American employees learned was ''dam,'' or no. In Japan, an employee committed hara-kiri, or ritual suicide, in the office of Bridgestone's president last year, to draw attention to the cause of workers asked to leave the company.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lampe said Firestone under Japanese ownership had moved much faster this summer than it did in 1978, when it was still an American company and when the eventual recall was linked to 41 deaths. Then, Firestone fought regulators for a year and a half to prevent a recall and the release of documents which, when finally handed over, showed that the company had known of problems with Firestone 500 tires for several years and covered them up.</p>
        <p>One big difference between then and now is that the 1978 recall involved many models, not just Ford vehicles, and automakers had little to say at the time.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the current recall involves only vehicles made by Ford and its affiliates, and most of the deaths have involved Explorers that rolled over. Leery of letting the reputation of one of its most profitable models be harmed, Ford has been increasingly outspoken in blaming Firestone and has released extensive Firestone data showing problems dating back to at least 1997.</p>
        <p>''This is a tire issue without question; it is not a vehicle issue,'' Mr. Nasser said today, later adding, ''I'm sorry that these defective tires are on our vehicles.''</p>
        <p>Yet American regulators are examining Ford's role, notably its recommendation that the tires on Explorers be inflated to just 26 pounds a square inch -- lower than what is called for on many rival models.</p>
        <p>For their part, Firestone officials have been loath to direct blame at their largest customer. But as Ford's comments have grown more pointed, they are beginning to point out that Firestone's very similar tires for other automakers' sport utility vehicles have not encountered similar problems.</p>
        <p>''This situation is somewhat unprecedented in itself, because the incidents that we've seen and the problems that we've seen have been primarily on one size tire on one application,'' Mr. Lampe said. ''We've got the same size tire on a number of other applications, and we're not seeing the same sort of circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoskins, who retired from Firestone nearly two years ago, was more blunt. ''It has nothing to do with the tires,'' he said. ''It has to do with S.U.V.'s, and with one kind of S.U.V. in particular.'' Ford officials have repeatedly pointed out that Explorers roll over less often than other midsize sport utility vehicles and that Explorers equipped with Goodyear tires have fared much better than those with Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>With the tallies of deaths, and the lawsuits and government investigations mounting, life is only growing more difficult for Firestone officials. Since it became apparent on Aug. 6 that a recall would be necessary, Mr. Lampe said, ''I have literally not been home except to sleep.''</p>
