        <p>When Senator Joseph I. Lieberman urged a greater role for religion in public life in campaign speeches this week, he touched off a new round in the sharp but unsettled debate over the role that personal beliefs should play in American politics.</p>
        <p>Some critics of Mr. Lieberman's remarks, including the Anti-Defamation League, cast the issue in terms of separation of church and state, suggesting that the senator had infringed that principle.</p>
        <p>But another way to look at what Mr. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat, said is to ask whether American culture has changed enough of late so that his remarks are more acceptable, socially and politically, than before.</p>
        <p>Those who say such a change has taken place can cite various reasons -- public unease over the political scandals of the late 1990's, for example, or the longer-term emergence of religious conservatives as a political force or a less tangible but pervasive interest in the personal over the political.</p>
        <p>''I think the Christian Coalition has added to our dialogue on politics and religion,'' said Paul Simon, the former Democratic senator from Illinois, referring both to the conservative organization of that name and also to the broader political movement of religious conservatives. ''Now, some of that is not good, but some of that is good, too.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon, who now directs the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University, said he thought Mr. Lieberman had made his remarks ''with great care.'' But he also said that some of the religious language used in the presidential campaign had left him uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>''My overall impression,'' Mr. Simon said, ''is, the deeply religious people don't talk about it as much.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, the first Jew on a major American presidential ticket, said in a speech last Sunday that Americans needed to ''renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's purpose.'' And while he said the Constitution ''wisely separates church from state,'' he added that there must be a place for faith in the nation's public life.</p>
        <p>In reacting to his remarks, some harkened back to the example set by John F. Kennedy, who sought to reassure voters in 1960 that his Roman Catholicism would not dictate his policies as president. Religious belief, Kennedy's words implied, is private.</p>
        <p>But four decades have elapsed since then, a long stretch in the cultural life of a still-young nation. In the United States, as Mr. Lieberman noted on Monday, polls show that religious belief remains unusually widespread, certainly when compared with Europe. Surveys report that 19 out of 20 Americans say they believe in God.</p>
        <p>What is more, the American marketplace -- both a guide to and an influence upon the broader culture -- recognizes no separation of the sacred and the profane, such that books by the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, can soar onto the best-seller lists, and CBS can broadcast a reverent mini-series on Jesus during its spring sweeps period.</p>
        <p>There is some statistical evidence, too, that public attitudes about religion and politics have shifted since the 1960's, blurring whatever boundary might have existed between the two.</p>
        <p>A new book, ''The Diminishing Divide: Religion's Changing Role in American Politics'' (Brookings Institution, 2000), reports that whereas a narrow majority of Americans in 1968 wanted churches to stay out of politics, that opposition had eroded by 1996, when a narrow majority said churches should freely express their views.</p>
        <p>One of the book's four authors, John Green, a professor of political science at the University of Akron, said that ''a greater demand'' existed for religious talk in political life and that there was also ''a greater supply of it.''</p>
        <p>''I think the public is more interested in values these days, particularly questions of morality, than they have been in the recent past,'' said Professor Green, who directs the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at his university.</p>
        <p>Professor Green said several factors were at work, among them diminishing worry over economic and international threats and a growing concern over the turmoil of political scandals, high school shootings and hate crimes.</p>
        <p>Political leaders ''have sensed this disquiet, and want to respond to it,'' Professor Green said, either by speaking of religious faith or talking more about broad values, as Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, does in speaking of the need for ''prosperity with a purpose.''</p>
        <p>One person critical of Mr. Lieberman this week, Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, agreed in part with some of Dr. Green's assessment, saying Americans had been shaken by the personal scandals involving political leaders, notably President Clinton and the former House speaker Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>''It's a general sense that our political leaders have failed us because they lacked moral grounding,'' Mr. Lynn said.</p>
        <p>As a result, he said, candidates ''feel compelled not just to say, here's my moral vision, but here's the religion that underlies it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynn called that ''unhealthy'' for a diverse society and a threat to provoke a sort of spiritual one-upmanship among candidates, each feeling so compelled to cite Scripture that the race for office becomes like ''a final exam in Bible studies.''</p>
        <p>Yet others suggest that the high profile that religion is receiving in the current presidential campaign reflects a subtler, longer-term trend, a growing interest among Americans in hearing the personal narratives, not simply the technical ideas, of their leaders.</p>
        <p>''People want to hear your story,'' said Richard J. Mouw, president of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif. ''I think today the question is, What kind of person is this, what kind of leader will he be?''</p>
        <p>In that case, Dr. Mouw said, ''having that person speak out of the depths of his own human experience, that kind of comes to be a value thing.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Mouw, who found Mr. Lieberman's statements pleasing, said that American society was more open to public expressions of religious identity than it was 30 years ago, when he received his doctorate in philosophy from the University of Chicago.</p>
        <p>''As a philosopher, you had to hide your religious convictions,'' he said, contrasting that with the present situation, in which Christian philosophers have their own association, which publishes a journal.</p>
        <p>''It's much more acceptable in the academic world than it was in 1970 to identify your religious convictions and speak openly about them,'' Dr. Mouw said.</p>
