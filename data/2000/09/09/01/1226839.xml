        <p>A steam pipe near the entrance to New York University's main library burst yesterday morning, spewing debris and traces of asbestos onto dozens of people and several cars and buildings in the area.</p>
        <p>The explosion, at 7:12 a.m., created a 15-foot-deep, 30-foot-wide crater in front of the entrance to the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library, which occupies most of one block on Washington Square South. It also caused parts of the street to buckle, forcing the authorities to reroute pedestrian and vehicle traffic in that part of Greenwich Village for hours.</p>
        <p>No injuries were reported, and officials said it was fortunate that classes had not yet started. The cause of the explosion was still being investigated last night.</p>
        <p>''You couldn't see anything, just this huge cloud of debris and steam,'' said Steve Wolenski, a mechanic at N.Y.U.'s central power plant, who was in his car at the other end of the block when the pipe burst. ''In an instant, mud was splattered all over my car. People were high-tailing it out of there big time.''</p>
        <p>As a precaution, city emergency management officials set up a decontamination site nearby for 58 people who had been exposed to the material that had rained down. Most of them were construction workers at the site of a student center being built around the corner on La Guardia Place; others were university employees and police officers.</p>
        <p>They showered inside either a special truck or an inflatable tent, and were issued white hazardous-material suits while their clothing was laundered, said Frank McCarton, a spokesman for the city's Office of Emergency Management.</p>
        <p>Following standard procedures, firefighters responding to the scene tested the area for asbestos, suspecting that it had been used to insulate the steam pipe, which was at least 30 years old. Their tests were positive.  Asbestos, once commonly used in home insulation and fireproofing, poses a health risk when it breaks down, becomes airborne and is inhaled. It has been linked to cancer and other diseases.</p>
        <p>But officials said they did not expect any lingering danger from the asbestos. ''There is nothing to be worried about,'' Mr. McCarton said. ''We just need to get the streets cleaned, cars cleaned and get this up and running again.''</p>
        <p>N.Y.U. hired a private team of  hazardous-materials workers, and they washed down cars, buildings and the construction site. The work was expected to continue through the night.</p>
        <p>It was too early to determine what caused the explosion, Mr. McCarton said, but he and N.Y.U. officials ruled out any connection to the student center construction site.</p>
        <p>John Beckman, a university spokesman, said the pipe that exploded was part of a system that provided more than 25 percent of the college's energy needs. The pipes are visually inspected weekly and internally examined once a year, he said, though the date of the most recent inspection was not available.</p>
        <p>While the library is expected to reopen to employees tomorrow, it remained unclear whether students would be allowed inside on Wednesday, when classes begin. Mr. Beckman said concerned employees and students should call a temporary phone line, (212) 998-1220.</p>
        <p>All in all, he said, the school was fortunate. ''Normally, our library is open 24 hours.''</p>
        <p>Because the university is closed for summer break, Mr. Beckman said, only a handful of people -- a cleaning crew and some security guards -- were in the library at the time of the explosion. ''It's an unlucky circumstance that happened in the luckiest possible time.''</p>
