        <p>The National Football League will allow television networks to outfit an on-field official with a miniature television camera during regular-season and postseason games this year.</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. allowed networks to experiment with the tiny camera during nine preseason games, giving fans a close-up view of the action in the middle of the field.</p>
        <p>Under the new plan, Fox, CBS, ABC and ESPN will be allowed to mount the camera on the hat of the umpire, the on-field official who typically stands behind the line of scrimmage.</p>
        <p>''It's not something you are going to use a lot, but there are certain plays it'll give you an intimate look at what is happening,'' said Ed Goren, Fox's executive director.</p>
        <p>Goren said the Green Bay Packers at Denver Broncos preseason game provided an excellent example.</p>
        <p>Broncos running back Olandis Gary scored a touchdown from the 3-yard line in the second half, and the camera showed the interior line knocking the legs out from under the defensive line, the bodies crashing to the ground and the running back scoring over the top.</p>
        <p>Fox will use the camera in three games a week, Goren said. This week it will be Arizona at the Giants, Philadelphia at Dallas, and Carolina at Washington.</p>
        <p>Terry Ewert, CBS's executive producer, said CBS would use the camera in this weekend's Jets at Green Bay Packers game and in future weeks will use one camera in the early game and one in the late game during doubleheader weekends.</p>
        <p>''We'll use it sparingly, and when it makes sense -- four or five times a game,'' Ewert said. ''We found it's useful showing the toughness of the game because you see blocking, plus the size and power of running backs coming right at you.''</p>
        <p>Executives at ABC and ESPN could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Networks also will be allowed to interview a player in addition to the head coaches at halftime. (Bloomberg News)</p>
        <p>BEUERLEIN CLOSE TO EXTENSION: Steve Beuerlein, who was once contemplating retirement when his current contract expires, said he was close to signing a two-year extension with the Carolina Panthers.</p>
        <p>''In principle, I think there has been an agreement,'' he said. ''It's just a matter now of getting everything cleaned up.''</p>
        <p>Beuerlein, a 35-year-old quarterback, originally signed with the Panthers in 1996 as a backup to Kerry Collins. He signed a three-year extension in 1998 that takes him through 2001.</p>
        <p>The additional two years on his contract will be worth $12.3 million and will give Carolina an option for an additional two years, through 2005.</p>
        <p>The deal will also provide immediate help for Carolina's strapped salary-cap situation, because part of this year's base salary will be restructured into bonus money.</p>
        <p>Beuerlein, in his 14th season, started all 16 games last year for the first time in his career. He threw for 4,436 yards and 36 touchdowns while leading Carolina to the second-best passing offense in the league and a spot in his first Pro Bowl.</p>
        <p>But the toll of the season was five operations during the off-season -- two for hernias, one on his shoulder, one on his knee and one on his ankle.</p>
        <p>But he said that they took care of lingering problems and that when he opens the season Sunday at Washington he will be feeling better than he has in years. (AP)</p>
        <p>C.F.L. TALKING TO XFL: The Canadian Football League has approached the XFL about allowing players under contract with Canadian teams to also suit up with franchises in the fledgling spring league.</p>
        <p>Jeff Giles, the C.F.L.'s president and chief operating officer, said yesterday that he had approached Mike Keller, the XFL's director of football operations, about the matter. No decision was reached, but Giles told Keller that C.F.L. general managers and the league's board of governors would discuss it.</p>
        <p>The C.F.L. season ends in late November, giving players at least a month to rest before the start of XFL training camps in January. (AP)</p>
