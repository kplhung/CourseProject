        <p>IN a world buried under a blizzard of polls, rankings, financial statistics and endless official data, we are increasingly pressured to trust in the absolute authority of numbers. Paradoxically, in a world where centuries-old religions tremble before the onslaught of American pop culture, it is tempting to throw up one's hands and clutch at the fantasy that individual lives can still be (in the sudsy language of television) ''touched by an angel.''</p>
        <p>The tensions between traditional faith, modern rationality and a belief in magic are the crux of ''The Decalogue,'' the Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski's 10-part, 10-hour masterwork filmed for Polish television in 1988. ''The Decalogue,'' which had its first New York theatrical release this summer, was an art-house hit at the Lincoln Plaza in Manhattan, where it earned $247,711 during its eight-week run.</p>
        <p>That number, of course, is minuscule by the standards of Hollywood, 12 of whose summer releases grossed over $100 million each. But it was enough to earn ''The Decalogue'' a repeat engagement at the Screening Room in TriBeCa, where it will be shown, starting today, in two-episode programs that change weekly.</p>
        <p>Does the popularity of ''The Decalogue'' mean that the so-called art film is alive and well? Yes and no, but with an emphasis on no. From the rosiest perspective, the art film, whose ''golden age'' (the 1950's and 60's) is currently being celebrated in a popular series at Film Forum in the South Village, is far from moribund. And most critics would agree that the cinemas of China, Iran, France, Denmark, Taiwan and Spain, among other countries, are flourishing artistically, if not producing many masterpieces.</p>
        <p>This summer also saw the theatrical release of three films worthy of comparison to the classics being screened at Film Forum. Besides ''The Decalogue,'' there was the French director Bruno Dumont's ''Humanite,'' which enjoyed an extended run at Film Forum, and the Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami's ''Wind Will Carry Us,'' which is still doing healthy business after several weeks at the Lincoln Plaza.</p>
        <p>By far the grandest of the three, ''The Decalogue,'' whose 10 stories are set in and around the same Warsaw housing project, offers an epic vision of the troubled human spirit at the end of the 20th century. With its fatalistic mood and enigmatic, carefully layered symbolism applied to a realistic setting, the cycle suggests a broader, more balanced and cosmopolitan descendant of Ingmar Bergman's anguished soundings of the soul in its dark night.</p>
        <p>Kieslowski, who died in 1996 (he was only 54), is arguably the greatest inheritor of this tradition, which included not only Mr. Bergman but also Michelangelo Antonioni, Robert Bresson, Carl Dreyer and Luis Bunuel among its masters. Each of the 10 fables of ''The Decalogue'' is a contemporary variation on one of the Ten Commandments. Far from preaching in the Hollywood biblical manner, these tales gaze with a searching (and sometimes teasing) concentration into the gaps between faith and reason, destiny and chance,  cause and effect, to discern elusive glimpses of a higher moral order governing human fate. Because they're stories created for a television series, they're also extremely entertaining.</p>
        <p>Interior Landscapes</p>
        <p>''Humanite'' and ''The Wind Will Carry Us'' offer piercing but narrower personal cinematic visions. Mr. Dumont's film enters the mind of a policeman who may or not be responsible for the crime he is investigating: the savage rape and murder of a young girl. Every image and sound is charged with an undercurrent of prowling animal menace. In stripping away a protective layer of psychic skin to evoke the policeman's apprehension of the physical world, this profoundly pessimistic but compassionate film finds the potential for animal violence in all its characters.</p>
        <p>''The Wind Will Carry Us,'' in its sympathetic portrayal of a hard-scrabble peasant existence in the arid Iranian countryside, recalls the humanistic films of the great Indian director Satyajit Ray. Its (sometimes frustratingly) elliptical story follows an engineer from Tehran to a remote rural area of Iran for reasons that are only hinted at and discovers a society in which people are so rooted to the earth that there is no room for brooding metaphysical speculation. Life simply goes on. These people, in tune with nature's rhythms and accepting of its caprices, live in a largely unconscious spiritual harmony with the world.</p>
        <p>While preaching a familiar live-in-the-moment message, the film avoids sentimentality through its literary austerity and its sly, glancing humor, and by mesmerizing us with the sheer beauty of the landscape.</p>
        <p>Europe's Forbidden Loves</p>
        <p>A film that falls just below this level is the German director Max Farberbock's ''Aimee and Jaguar.'' Set in wartime Berlin, this true story of the lesbian relationship between Felice Schragenheim (Maria Schrader), an assimilated German Jew risking her life to work in the Jewish underground, and Lilly Wust (Juliane Kohler), the wife of a German Army officer, is a wrenching, beautifully acted romance with historical resonance.</p>
        <p>On a level below that is ''Solomon and Gaenor,'' a gritty, well-acted variation on ''Romeo and Juliet'' set in an impoverished Welsh mining village in 1917. The tragedy that results when a deceitful Russian-Jewish immigrant from an Orthodox family impregnates a young Protestant woman is touching, if predictable.</p>
        <p>A Withering Relic</p>
        <p>But if art films can still draw small audiences into theaters, evaluated in hard dollars-and-cents terms, the genre is a withering relic. With the rise of the multiplex, the number of art houses in the United States has diminished by as much as two-thirds since the early 1990's. American audiences increasingly have no patience with subtitled films. And as the globalization of popular culture accelerates, homegrown cinema in other countries is being overshadowed by Hollywood.</p>
        <p>Even in France, which has Europe's most heavily subsidized film industry, Hollywood films accounted for 91 percent of the country's film revenues this summer. While American movies like ''M:I-2'' and ''Gladiator'' cleaned up at the box office,  only 1 out of 20 French-made films was a solid hit. The increasing failure of so many French films to engage the public has given rise to much grumbling and is viewed as a looming cultural crisis.</p>
        <p>As for high-minded films from the United States, the pickings this year have been slimmer than ever. The New York Film Festival, which opens on Sept. 22, has few high-profile American films, since Hollywood, for its own marketing reasons, would rather unveil its prestigious fall releases two weeks earlier at the Toronto Film Festival. Some believe that Hollywood's aversion to New York is based on a fear that potential hits might suffer commercially if showing them here first caused them to be perceived as too highbrow.</p>
        <p>Deeper social and cultural currents are also working against the art film as we've known it. The probing psychological realism and erotic frankness that seemed revelatory and boundary-breaking to an older generation are now taken for granted by younger audiences inured to (and amused by) ''The Jerry Springer Show.'' Today everyone knows the vocabularies of psychotherapy and of sex according to Krafft-Ebing and  Masters and Johnson.</p>
        <p>It's also a sign of the times that two of the summer's biggest art-house hits, Mike Hodges's ''Croupier'' and the revival of Jules Dassin's ''Rififi,'' are smart, stylish genre films that don't probe great metaphysical depths. ''Croupier'' is a cleverly plotted caper film with a flashy central performance by Clive Owen, who exudes some of the charisma of the young Michael Caine. The likable ''Rififi'' is more influential as a granddaddy of the caper  film than it is artistically substantial.</p>
        <p>In this climate the term ''art film'' itself seems increasingly like a relic. When applied strictly to a business in which the word ''art'' is thrown around loosely, it doesn't really describe the majority of smaller independent movies that have helped revitalize American cinema in recent years and that make up the backbone of the annual Sundance Film Festival. Even if many of them show more integrity and personal vision than most Hollywood fare, hardly any aspire to the lofty intellectual tradition of the greatest European films from 1950's and 60's.</p>
        <p>The word that might best describe the more ambitious American independent films playing in New York right now is the same one applied to 1990's rock music: alternative. ''Chuck and Buck'' and ''The Tao of Steve,'' two smart independent films that were first seen at Sundance, both focus on the kind of geeky men that mainstream Hollywood films reflexively ridicule. In ''Chuck and Buck,'' a young man suffering from an acute case of arrested development travels to Hollywood and stalks his best friend from childhood with whom he played boyhood sexual games.</p>
        <p>Hollywood would probably never make a movie like ''Chuck and Buck,'' because it would be considered too threatening to a young male audience. But if by any chance it did, the story would surely end in a murder. ''Chuck and Buck,'' while not literally believable, is more tender-hearted. Reminiscent in some ways of Todd Solondz's subversive family satire ''Happiness,'' it is really a  fable of how we all carry our childhood within us, whether or not we admit it. Mike White's portrayal of the creepy, pathetic, lollipop-addicted Buck is the stunt performance of the year, comparable in virtuosity to that of Hilary Swank as a transgender murder victim in ''Boys Don't Cry.''</p>
        <p>An Alternative Niche</p>
        <p>''The Tao of Steve'' is a witty, lighthearted portrait of an extremely overweight, improbably successful womanizer (Donal Logue) whose technique of seduction involves putting a distorted Buddhism into action. A Hollywood version of the same idea would probably star a Chris Farley type and be an extended, offensive fat joke.</p>
        <p>One alternative niche that American independent cinema is doing a good job filling is the market for camp. ''Psycho Beach Party'' translates to the screen Charles Busch's uproarious drag theatrical spoof of the ''Gidget'' and ''Beach Party''  films (and the seething subtexts under their squeaky-clean surfaces). Margaret Cho's concert film, ''I'm the One That I Want,'' is a hilarious, autobiographical cri de coeur from this Korean-American comedian  that deals pungently with her devastating experience of being racially stereotyped on network television.</p>
        <p>Biotechnology Revolution</p>
        <p>Finally there is John Waters's witty but not howlingly funny comedy, ''Cecil B. DeMented,'' in which a cult of cinematic terrorists kidnaps a Hollywood star (Melanie Griffith) and forces her to appear in its cinema verite guerrilla attacks on movie theaters. Mr. Waters's movie inadvertently exemplifies the plight of the art films that it pretends to champion so ardently. But its terrorists' movie aesthetics are so stringent that, as the critic Anthony Lane astutely pointed out, the enemy isn't only Hollywood and philistinism but the movie audience itself.</p>
        <p>''Cecil B. DeMented'' unwittingly points toward the basic shift in popular culture at the turn of the millennium, as the vision of humanity evoked by movies, music and television evolves from one rooted in psychology to one more anchored in biotechnology. On fronts ranging from sports medicine to psychotherapy to fashion, popular art increasingly views people as perfectible machines who can be improved through drugs, diet, exercise and surgery. Most of the soul's ailments, this view presupposes, are physical imbalances that can be corrected.</p>
        <p>As millions avail themselves of everything from Prozac to plastic surgery, this mechanized notion of the human body has begun to take hold. And it seems bound to accelerate. Cloning, genetic engineering and the unraveling of the human genome tantalize us with the prospect of extended life and beyond that, perhaps even immortality, through some hybrid of human and computer.</p>
        <p>Already digital technology can infinitely replicate sounds and images without any degradation of quality, and the Internet has made us figuratively omniscient. With all these humanly engineered intimations of infinity, who needs God when you can imagine being God? But until immortality arrives, there's always the  gratification of turning yourself into a pumped-up action figure with 5 percent body fat or a curvaceous pin-up with fake 42-inch breasts.</p>
        <p>A New Darwinism</p>
        <p>For all its promise, the biotech version of human life, in which all pleasure, even spiritual rapture, is  quantifiable, is also profoundly animalistic. Beneath its progressive agenda, it is pure Darwinism. From  reality television to professional wrestling to the beat-driven boasts  and retorts of hip-hop to gross-out blockbuster films, the messages of popular culture are becoming more brutally competitive.</p>
        <p>Many have already commented on the sexual crudeness embedded in many of this summer's Hollywood blockbusters, in which one movie after another paraded gross-out anal gags that left little to the imagination. Conventional wisdom says that the appetite for crude humor is merely a sign of the movie audience's youth, that dirty-minded adolescents have always been dirty-minded adolescents.</p>
        <p>But the popularity of gross-out humor may be more than just a result of a conjunction between adolescence and the lifting of taboos. It's arguably another powerful sign of -- and perhaps an anxious response to -- the mass cultural shift away from spiritual and psychological ground to the purely physical. Goodbye, Freud, Marx and Einstein! Hello, lab technician! We don't need those old philosophers. We've been there and done that. This is the brave new world.</p>
        <p>But here, where life is an endless contest and the pressure to compete nonstop, the climate is a bit chilly. Yet this is what the majority seems to want. The most popular television shows (''Survivor,'' ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'') have become contests, and more and more Hollywood movies are obsessed with winning, whether the reward is being crowned prom queen or victory in an ancient  Roman arena.</p>
        <p>Haunting Mysteries</p>
        <p>In such a pressurized climate, it's reassuring to be reminded that for all our polish and technological know-how we are still messy animals who leave behind a stench. We're all fools stumbling in our own body waste. The more intense the pressure, the more explosive the laughter.</p>
        <p>One of the great things about Kieslowski is that he sensed what was coming. In its opening episode, inspired by the commandment ''Thou shalt have no other God before me,'' a professor's brilliant, computer-wise young son is torn between the values of his rationalist father, who doesn't believe in an afterlife, and those of his devoutly Catholic aunt. When the boy decides he wants to go skating, his father helps him calculate the thickness of the ice on the lake to make sure it's safe. But these careful calculations don't ensure the boy's safety, and he falls through the ice and drowns.</p>
        <p>The story is embellished with surreal touches that suggest the professor's hubris shattered by the hand of fate. In one touch, both the father's and son's computers appear to have minds of their own. After the boy dies, the father arrives home to find his computer mysteriously turned on. It flashes an enigmatic message in English: ''I am ready.''</p>
