        <p>Home-plate umpire Chris Guccione earns wrath of both teams for his seeming reluctance to call strikes in game between New York Yankees and Seattle Mariners; Yankees defeated Mariners, 5-4; photo (M)</p>

        <p>For more than a half-hour after the Yankees' 5-4 victory in Seattle Wednesday, a voice resounded throughout their clubhouse, in a familiar refrain. ''Ball one,'' Glenallen Hill shouted. ''Ball two. Ball three.'' A couple of minutes would go by. ''Ball four. Ball one. Ball two. Ball three. . . .'' And so on.</p>
        <p>It probably was not a coincidence that Hill's solo act followed a brutally slow 4-hour-8-minute game -- nine innings -- in which the home-plate umpire, Chris Guccione, earned the wrath of both teams for his seeming reluctance to call strikes. In the very first inning, David Cone threw a slider that appeared to be right down the middle, on an 0-2 pitch to Rickey Henderson, and Guccione called it a ball. This went on and on, with players from both sides frustrated with Guccione, a minor league umpire called up as a temporary replacement.</p>

        <p>For more than a half-hour after the Yankees' 5-4 victory in Seattle Wednesday, a voice resounded throughout their clubhouse, in a familiar refrain. ''Ball one,'' Glenallen Hill shouted. ''Ball two. Ball three.'' A couple of minutes would go by. ''Ball four. Ball one. Ball two. Ball three. . . .'' And so on.</p>
        <p>It probably was not a coincidence that Hill's solo act followed a brutally slow 4-hour-8-minute game -- nine innings -- in which the home-plate umpire, Chris Guccione, earned the wrath of both teams for his seeming reluctance to call strikes. In the very first inning, David Cone threw a slider that appeared to be right down the middle, on an 0-2 pitch to Rickey Henderson, and Guccione called it a ball. This went on and on, with players from both sides frustrated with Guccione, a minor league umpire called up as a temporary replacement.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, who has become increasingly critical about the quality of the strike zone interpretations he is seeing this year, seemed more exasperated with Guccione after the game than pleased that his team won.</p>
        <p>''The best thing that I can say about the umpiring is that there were four of them,'' Torre said. ''I think he had trouble seeing the ball sometimes.''</p>
        <p>The umpiring, Torre said, hasn't been very good. ''I'd like to think something is going to get better,'' he said. ''The game is out of the control of the players right now.''</p>
        <p>Cone (4-11) allowed a run over five and two-thirds innings, as the Yankees built a 5-1 lead. But Dwight Gooden, who had pitched out of a bases-loaded jam in the seventh, allowed a two-run homer to Mark McLemore in the eighth. Seattle had runners at first and third with nobody out against Mariano Rivera in the ninth inning.</p>
        <p>After Al Martin struck out -- Rivera was throwing 95-96 miles an hour -- the Mariners cut the lead to 5-4 on a fielder's choice. Then Raul Ibanez grounded to second to end the game, and the Yankees could finally head home, at the end of a West Coast road trip in which they won four and lost two.</p>
        <p>''We came out here three games up,'' said Paul O'Neill, ''and we go back five games up, and that's the important thing.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees will play host to Minnesota in a three-game series this weekend, before going on the road again to play four games in Kansas City and three in Boston.</p>
