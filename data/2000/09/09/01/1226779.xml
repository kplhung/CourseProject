        <p>''Titanic Town'' is by no means the first film to portray the profoundly disruptive effects on everyday life of the long-running troubles in Northern Ireland. But in its harshly realistic scenes of British Army tanks rolling across the lawns of a middle-class housing development in West Belfast, it stirs your blood. As helicopters hover overhead and armed gunmen dart from house to house to flush out Irish Republican Army guerrillas in the middle of the afternoon, the community appears to be a besieged enclave continually terrorized by a ruthless occupying army.</p>
        <p>It's not that simple, of course. In 1972, the year this beautifully acted film remembers with an acute eye and ear for period detail, the Andersontown section of West Belfast, in which ''Titanic Town'' is set, was an I.R.A. stronghold. But although ''Titanic Town,'' which opens today at the Loews State, aspires to be nonpartisan and on the side of peace, its portrayal of British officials as supercilious and conniving, and the Irish Catholic residents of Andersontown as victims, leaves little doubt as to where the movie's political sympathies lie.</p>

        <p>''Titanic Town'' is by no means the first film to portray the profoundly disruptive effects on everyday life of the long-running troubles in Northern Ireland. But in its harshly realistic scenes of British Army tanks rolling across the lawns of a middle-class housing development in West Belfast, it stirs your blood. As helicopters hover overhead and armed gunmen dart from house to house to flush out Irish Republican Army guerrillas in the middle of the afternoon, the community appears to be a besieged enclave continually terrorized by a ruthless occupying army.</p>
        <p>It's not that simple, of course. In 1972, the year this beautifully acted film remembers with an acute eye and ear for period detail, the Andersontown section of West Belfast, in which ''Titanic Town'' is set, was an I.R.A. stronghold. But although ''Titanic Town,'' which opens today at the Loews State, aspires to be nonpartisan and on the side of peace, its portrayal of British officials as supercilious and conniving, and the Irish Catholic residents of Andersontown as victims, leaves little doubt as to where the movie's political sympathies lie.</p>
        <p>The film, directed by Roger Michell from a screenplay by Anne Devlin, is based on Mary Costello's autobiographical novel of her own adolescence in Andersontown in the early 1970's. No sooner have the McPhelimys, a family of six, moved to the area than they are horrified to find themselves trapped in a war zone where sporadic violence erupts at all hours of the day. The situation is so stressful that before long Aidan (Ciaran Hinds), the McPhelimys' pessimistic, sad-faced paterfamilias, develops a severe case of bleeding ulcers and has to be rushed to the hospital.</p>
        <p>His wife, Bernie (Julie Walters), however, is so outraged by the daytime skirmishes that she impulsively takes action and comes up with the faintly comical notion of requesting that both sides schedule their conflicts at hours that are less hazardous to children. The final straw that drives her to undertake what evolves into a full-scale peace movement is an I.R.A. gunman's accidental shooting of an innocent neighbor who is caught in crossfire. Refusing to acknowledge its mistake, the I.R.A. gleefully fans the flames of hatred by blaming the British.</p>
        <p>When Bernie naively accepts an invitation to speak at a meeting organized by local Protestant women, it is disrupted by an angry mob of her neighbors, who storm the meeting hall, screaming curses. She is deemed a traitor to the Irish Republican cause, and the McPhelimys become neighborhood pariahs, harassed with death threats and bricks tossed through their windows.</p>
        <p>All this is viewed through the frightened and resentful eyes of the McPhelimys' teenage daughter, Annie (Nuala O'Neill), who just wants a boyfriend and a normal teenage life. But her mother turns a deaf ear to her misery. The harassment has only stiffened Bernie's resolve to work for a peaceful solution to the violence. Eventually she comes up with the notion of circulating a petition among the women of Andersontown, calling for a cease-fire. The rest of the film follows her uphill, eventually successful campaign for support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Michell, a South African-born theater director and playwright who was a resident director of the Royal Shakespeare Company and created a splash with his adaptation of Jane Austen's ''Persuasion,'' emerges with ''Titanic Town'' as a gifted realist filmmaker. Ms. Walters's powerful performance underplays Bernie's heroism, emphasizing her bull-headedness, political naivete and indifference to her family's needs. But as Bernie evolves, she learns to become a more sophisticated political  strategist and a bit more sensitive to her loved ones' anguish. This blunt, rough-hewn character is entirely devoid of vanity, even after she becomes something of a celebrity.</p>
        <p>Ms. Devlin's screenplay shows a fine ear for everyday conversation. But except for Mr. Hinds's haunted, anxious Aidan, the movie falters in bringing the other McPhelimys (including Annie) fully to life. When the movie ends with their departure from Andersontown, we still don't know enough about who they are, where they came from or where they're going.</p>
        <p>The soundtrack makes exquisite use of the early 1970's recordings of John Martyn, the Scottish singer and songwriter whose romantic growl also memorably embellished the end credits of ''The Talented Mr. Ripley.''</p>
