        <p>DICK-Stuart. Departed this life on August 30, 2000 at home following a long and courageous battle with lung cancer. Beloved husband of Dacota; devoted father of Aviva, Christina, Melissa and Maxwell. Dedicated son to his mother, Frances. He was cherished by his extended families and dear friends. Stuart loved life and most of all considered it a privilege to have been a professor. His work was his passion and he had the wonderful opportunity to have touched many lives through his teaching. His passing leaves a void that will never be filled. He will be fondly remembered by those whom he has loved and by those who have loved him. In lieu of flowers, contribution in his name should be made to Cabrini Hospice, 227 East 19 Street, New York, NY 10003.</p>
