        <p>IT'S not a stretch to call Faye Levy's 625-page volume, ''1,000 Jewish Recipes,'' a culinary bible. It may be the only Jewish cookbook you'll ever need.</p>
        <p>It begins with recipes for the Jewish holidays, starting, oddly enough, with Passover instead of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which this year begins on Friday at sundown. Holidays are the focus of about 300 of the dishes here. The rest are categorized by course, from appetizers to desserts.</p>

        <p>IT'S not a stretch to call Faye Levy's 625-page volume, ''1,000 Jewish Recipes,'' a culinary bible. It may be the only Jewish cookbook you'll ever need.</p>
        <p>It begins with recipes for the Jewish holidays, starting, oddly enough, with Passover instead of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, which this year begins on Friday at sundown. Holidays are the focus of about 300 of the dishes here. The rest are categorized by course, from appetizers to desserts.</p>
        <p>Ms. Levy, who has written a number of reliable cookbooks, both kosher and nonkosher, alternates between Sephardic, or Mediterranean and Middle Eastern, dishes and the Ashkenazic cuisine of Northern Europe and Russia, explaining the characteristics of each style. She takes advantage of the luxury she has in this volume (IDG Books Worldwide, $35) to unbutton her rich creativity and offer variation upon variation for classic dishes.</p>
        <p>Tired of the same old potato or noodle kugel? You'll find more than 20 kugels here, including a lush double-corn version, like a corn pudding, which I loved. Another one amounted to macaroni and cheese. For knishes, tzimmes, hallah and latkes there are also dozens of options.</p>
        <p>Yet some of the dishes, especially the salads, offered variations that seemed so subtle they hardly merited separate recipes. The corn, sweet pepper and green bean salad for Rosh Hashana is almost the same as the corn, green bean and zucchini salad with tomatoes for Shavuot. But then, the author had that 1,000-recipe challenge.</p>
        <p>Her potato kugel with Parmesan, eggplant stuffed with rice and pine nuts, apple bread pudding made with hallah, and fish fillets baked with olive oil, vinegar, white wine and pine nuts are dishes I will make again for many occasions. The old-fashioned cinnamon coffeecake could have used more filling for my taste, but its flavor and light texture took on more character after it had been set aside, well wrapped, for a day.</p>
        <p>The introduction provides a thorough explanation of the requirements of kosher food, like making sure meat is cooked until well done so there is no blood. Taking this into account, Ms. Levy wisely omits recipes for beef steaks and roasts that usually taste best when cooked medium rare.</p>
        <p>Kosher meat is cut only from the forequarters, so the tender loin cuts are not used, and it is also not aged, which is another method for tenderizing. That makes braised and stewed dishes, like the ones included in this book, preferable to roasts or grills.</p>
        <p>Ms. Levy's fish dishes are also thoroughly cooked, a preference that has nothing to do with the dietary rules, so if medium-rare salmon is to your taste, simply reduce the cooking time called for.</p>
        <p>An alluring and simple recipe for stewed quinces, which Ms. Levy says is a traditional sweet to start Rosh Hashana, could also be served alongside roast duck. As a change of pace from roast chicken, she offers a delicious chicken stew, fragrant with spices and smothered with onions, that can be made in advance and reheated. My only quibble is that, like her excellent chicken baked with green olives, it needed a good splash of lemon juice to round out the flavor.</p>
        <p>QUINCES IN CINNAMON SYRUP  Adapted from ''1,000 Jewish Recipes''  Time: 1 hour 20 minutes, plus chilling</p>
        <p>6 large quinces, cut in eighths and cored  1 strip lemon peel,  1/2 inch wide and 2 inches long  1 3/4 cups sugar  4 teaspoons ground cinnamon.</p>
        <p>1. Place quinces in a heavy saucepan. Add lemon peel and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil. Cook uncovered over medium heat, occasionally turning quinces, about 50 minutes, until they are tender and half the water has evaporated. Discard lemon peel.</p>
        <p>2. Add sugar and cinnamon. Swirl pan gently to dissolve sugar without disturbing quinces. Cook over medium-low heat, gently basting quinces, 20 minutes. Quinces should look glazed. If necessary, remove them with a slotted spoon, and cook syrup down a bit before pouring over quinces. Refrigerate quinces and syrup in a bowl. Serve cold.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>ONION-SMOTHERED CHICKEN  Adapted from ''1,000 Jewish Recipes''  Time: 1 hour 10 minutes</p>
        <p>1 3-pound chicken, cut in serving pieces  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  3 large onions, halved and thinly sliced  1 teaspoon ground cumin  1 teaspoon ground coriander  1 teaspoon paprika  4 large cloves garlic, chopped</p>
        <p>3/4 cup chicken stock  Juice of  1/2 lemon  1 teaspoon minced flat-leaf parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Season chicken pieces liberally with pepper and, if you are not using a kosher chicken, with salt.</p>
        <p>2. Heat oil in large, deep saute pan. Lightly brown chicken pieces in two shifts over medium heat. Remove. Add onions, and cook over medium-low heat until softened, about 10 minutes. Return chicken and any juices to saute pan. Add cumin, coriander, paprika, garlic and stock. Cover and simmer, turning chicken once or twice, about 30 minutes, until cooked through.</p>
        <p>3. Remove chicken from pan, leaving onion. Skim excess fat. Add lemon and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Return chicken to pan, baste with sauce and reheat a few minutes. Serve sprinkled with parsley.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
