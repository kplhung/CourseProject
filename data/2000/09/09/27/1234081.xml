        <p>The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry thought it might be a good idea to prepare a handbook for member companies interested in learning how to cope more effectively with the media during a crisis.</p>
        <p>Its idea was so good the chamber badly underestimated the demand. The 1,000 copies it had printed in mid-July sold out in a day. To catch up, it printed an additional 42,000.</p>
        <p>Corporate Japan has suddenly awakened to the need for crisis control. Unsettled because of the public relations blunders committed by big Japanese companies like Bridgestone, Mitsubishi Motors and Snow Brand in recent weeks, Japanese managers are scrambling to learn how to avoid the appearance of looking irresponsible and uncaring.</p>
        <p>Officials in charge of general affairs or public relations are collecting books and literature on crisis management, calling consultants for seminars and training sessions, and rethinking the way their companies handle public crises.</p>
        <p>Tatsumi Tanaka, a Tokyo crisis management consultant, said his firm had been swamped with requests for lectures and seminars -- 10 times the requests he had been getting before July, when revelations of corporate skulduggery seemed to start coming all at once.</p>
        <p>First there was a scandal at Snow Brand, a leading producer of milk and dairy products, which was held responsible for a food poisoning that sickened thousands. Then Mitsubishi Motors admitted it had concealed customer complaints about faulty automobiles for more than two decades. More recently, Bridgestone has been criticized in the Japanese media over the defective tires sold by the company's Firestone subsidiary, mostly in the United States. Bridgestone officials, who at first seemed to treat the scandal as a minor event in a foreign country, are now feeling the strain of public relations damage.</p>
        <p>Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading economic daily, said recently that while Ford conducted a highly effective public relations campaign that faulted the tires, ''Bridgestone's 'silence' strategy failed in that it only bred mistrust in consumers and investors.''</p>
        <p>Glen Fukushima, president in Japan of the consulting firm Arthur D. Little, said: ''P.R. is not considered all that important. You can see that from the fact that public relations is not a big industry here.''</p>
        <p>There are about 200 public relations firms in Japan, a fraction of the number in the United States, and the majority of them are one-person operations. Most public relations work at these firms revolves around product and service promotions and rarely deals with crisis management.</p>
        <p>A survey done by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce of member companies showed only 11 percent said they would contact a public relations firm or an advertising agency when a major crisis hit their company.</p>
        <p>''Dealing with the media in a crisis is where Japanese companies are the weakest,'' said Atsushi Kuse, a crisis management expert. Consequently, he said, their response to the public often deviates wildly from what the public perceives as right.</p>
        <p>Companies implicated in scandal often admit to only a small portion of what later turns out to be a systematic flaw in the company's products or quality control, as was the case with Mitsubishi and Snow Brand.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, chief executives utter inadvertent remarks as they flounder through news conferences. When Snow Brand's president, Tetsuro Ishikawa, who resigned in disgrace in July, was confronted with a reporter asking him why he decided to cut short the news conference, Mr. Ishikawa replied under the gaze of TV cameras: ''You! I haven't even been sleeping these days.'' The nationally televised scene was broadcast repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Corporate attitudes toward public relations in Japan have been shaped partly by the country's postwar economic boom, when manufacturers mass-produced quality products at what were considered fair prices, industrial companies grew and the standard of living rose. The small number of consumer complaints were ignored or suppressed.</p>
        <p>But the sensibilities of Japanese consumers have changed drastically in recent years. Their tastes have diversified and they are armed with information they can use to compare products and commiserate with each other.</p>
        <p>''Japan's society is changing,'' Mr. Tanaka said. ''Companies haven't realized that.''</p>
        <p>Even when Mr. Tanaka is called in by a scandal-hit company to consult, he said, the management often remains dishonest. ''First, they lie to me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another new variable is the gradual demise of lifetime employment in Japan. The readiness of many big companies to shed unwanted workers is spawning a growing number of disgruntled workers who no longer display the loyalty to their employers they once did.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Mitsubishi cover-up scandal came to light when an insider tipped off Transport Ministry officials about the company's practices.</p>
