        <p>In his toughest attack yet in this campaign, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman yesterday portrayed the platform of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as a wide-ranging deception, saying their promises contradicted their records.</p>
        <p>''Over the last several weeks, there has been a troubling pattern emerging in this election,'' Mr. Lieberman said in an address to a bricklayers' union convention in Atlantic City. ''On issue after issue, our opponents tell us one thing, but their records and the details of their plans tell us something very different.''</p>

        <p>In his toughest attack yet in this campaign, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman yesterday portrayed the platform of Gov. George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as a wide-ranging deception, saying their promises contradicted their records.</p>
        <p>''Over the last several weeks, there has been a troubling pattern emerging in this election,'' Mr. Lieberman said in an address to a bricklayers' union convention in Atlantic City. ''On issue after issue, our opponents tell us one thing, but their records and the details of their plans tell us something very different.''</p>
        <p>His remarks signaled an intensified offensive against Mr. Bush, and  echoed the Republicans' main line of attack, the charge of inconsistency and hypocrisy. The Democrats are bent on painting Mr. Bush as a staunch conservative who poses as a moderate with empty promises on education and health care.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, challenged Mr. Bush's recent claims that public education has stagnated under the Clinton administration, calling the claims unfair to schools that are improving. And while he gave a long list of education projects that Vice President Al Gore would invest in, he said the Republicans would have no money to spend on schools after their tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''I'll tell you what the real education gap is in America this year,'' the senator said. ''It's the gap in the Bush-Cheney campaign between what they're talking about and what their plan will actually do. When it comes to education, I promise you Al Gore and I have not only the will to improve education in our country, but the wallet -- or the money left in the wallet -- to make it happen.''</p>
        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ''Senator Lieberman would be better served explaining why America's in the midst of an education recession in the Clinton-Gore years. We've seen test scores stagnate, and the achievement gap between minority students and their peers remains wide.''</p>
        <p>For the first time, Mr. Lieberman directly criticized the record of Mr. Cheney, asserting that his record directly contradicted the Republicans' recent claims that they would ''leave no child behind.''</p>
        <p>''When he was in Congress in the 1980's, he voted against Head Start funding five times, against measures important to the school lunch program six times,'' Mr. Lieberman said of Mr. Cheney. ''He was one of only 33 members of the House of Representatives to vote against a plan to provide a lump-sum benefit to widows and children of federal law enforcement officers and firefighters killed in the line of duty.''</p>
        <p>He also noted that under Mr. Bush, Texas ranks near the bottom among all states in the percentage of its children with health insurance.</p>
