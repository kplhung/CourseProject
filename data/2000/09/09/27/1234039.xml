        <p>The day's competition ends, and Fatso lives another day. Fatso is a stuffed wombat with an oversized posterior who is the mascot and inanimate co-star of ''The Dream,'' a bawdy and disrespectful Olympic wrap-up program carried nightly by the Seven Network, which is broadcasting the Summer Games to Australia.</p>
        <p>Fatso's unlikely celebrity was elevated by his surprise appearances in the clutches of several medal-winning Australian swimmers, which led to worries that Australian Olympic officials would bar him from future official ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Stuffed wombats get their 15 minutes of fame here and then are embroiled in silly controversy.</p>
        <p>''I'm not aware of banning Fatso,'' Francois Carrard, director general of the International Olympic Committee, said.</p>
        <p>Milton Cockburn, a spokesman for the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, said, ''We have a sense of humor, but we have no comment on Fatso.''</p>
        <p>With no planning, Fatso has become a star well beyond its creators' modest expectations and is superseding the appeal of the Games' official mascots: Syd (a platypus), Olly (a kookaburra) and Millie (an echidna).</p>
        <p>''I've got an out-of-control wombat phenomenon on my hands,'' said Todd Abbott, who produces ''The Dream.''</p>
        <p>The longtime radio partners Roy Slaven and H. G. Nelson play host to the show, which lampoons the seriousness of sports coverage. The show offers irreverent and ribald insights into Greco-Roman wrestling and weight lifting and whispered gymnastics play-by-play that describes floor exercise maneuvers as ''hello boys,'' ''crazy dates'' and a ''wide walk with a touch of goose.''</p>
        <p>They also mocked Dick Pound, the I.O.C. vice president, with his sons in the small studio audience and created a report about the invasion of Bogon moths in Sydney and their terrorizing of javelin throwers.</p>
        <p>On Monday night, which ''The Dream'' dubbed ''Merchandisers Monday,'' Slaven and Nelson ridiculed the Sydney organizing committee's new licensed yellow boxing kangaroo, which lacks the pouch used to carry its young.</p>
        <p>''It is anatomically a disaster,'' Slaven said, outraged.</p>
        <p>''Whereas our little guy!'' said Nelson, holding up Fatso to the cheers of the tiny audience. ''People take him to their hearts. He talks to people around the world. The little guy stands for all that is good and decent -- about people overcoming hardship. He's the battling prince.''</p>
        <p>''The Dream'' bears similarities to Comedy Central's ''Daily Show,'' a nightly parody of network news shows, but there is nothing like it to poke merciless fun at American sports television. (Bill Conlin's cynical comments on ESPN's ''Sports Reporters'' don't count.) Slaven and Nelson have been given free rein to skewer all things Olympic for 17 days, with no apparent objection from the I.O.C.</p>
        <p>''We didn't give quality time to developing the show until about six weeks ago,'' Abbott said. ''This is pretty much what we've planned, but their characters and language have taken their normal performances to new levels.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Our feedback from officialdom and other broadcasters has been extraordinary. People are stunned that we get away with what we do and that we can pull this off for two hours a day. It's a perfect antidote to the Games.''</p>
        <p>The daily planning of the two-hour show is so frantic, Abbott said, that Slaven and Nelson are not being made available for interviews.</p>
        <p>Which brings us back to the wombat, who isn't talking, either. He was created when the gold pins to be given to the show's guests, some of whom are flummoxed by the tone of its smart but bizarre hosts, needed a character with an attitude problem. Hence, Fatso, a wombat best known for his rear end and delight in the sight of athletes failing.</p>
        <p>In addition to sharing the medal stand with the likes of Michael Klim, he has also partied at a Sydney club with the American swimmers Gary Hall Jr. and Misty Hyman and was cuddled by Carl Lewis.</p>
        <p>The network has been inundated with requests that it license Fatso to be merchandised, as Syd, Millie and Olly have, but Abbott said the plush wombat will remain pure. He is not for sale. Abbott said: ''We'll probably auction him off for Olympic Aid.''</p>
        <p>In the Glow of Victory</p>
        <p>Prime Minister John Howard emerged Tuesday as Australia's latest Olympic winner. During the first week of the Games, Howard visited a string of events at which Australians won gold medals.</p>
        <p>There was Howard with the trap shooter Michael Diamond, the swimming star Ian Thorpe, the gold medal-winning equestrian team -- repeatedly bathing in the athletes' reflected glory before a huge television audience.</p>
        <p>A poll published today indicated a slight jump in Howard's popularity, despite a tumbling Australian dollar and rising fuel prices.</p>
        <p>In a telephone poll of 1,153 people conducted from Sept. 22-24 by Newspoll, 44 percent of respondents said Howard would make a better prime minister than his Labor Party rival, Kim Beazley. A pre-Olympic poll showed Howard at 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Beazley was unchanged on 36 percent. The paper gave no margin of error. (AP)</p>
        <p>A Salute to the Volunteers</p>
        <p>More than 50,000 volunteers who worked at the Games will be thanked with their own parade through Sydney's streets, New South Wales Premier Bob Carr said today.</p>
        <p>He added that a free concert would follow the march.</p>
        <p>''We want to invite those 50,000 volunteers to walk through the streets of this city to the acclaim of the people of Sydney who know that the volunteers have been indispensable to the great success of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games,'' Carr said. (AP)</p>
