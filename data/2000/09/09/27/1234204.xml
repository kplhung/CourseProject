        <p>Newsstand employees at the Hudson News Company voted last week to become members of the Newspaper Guild of New York, a division of the Communications Workers of America. The employees, most of them immigrants from India or Pakistan, voted 197 to 121 to join.</p>
        <p>In March 1999, Hudson News employees voted against joining. Barry Lipton, president of the Newspaper Guild of New York, said Monday that the newsstand workers voted to join this time around because the guild used more organizers to persuade the workers to join.</p>

        <p>In March 1999, Hudson News employees voted against joining. Barry Lipton, president of the Newspaper Guild of New York, said Monday that the newsstand workers voted to join this time around because the guild used more organizers to persuade the workers to join.</p>
        <p>He said many workers wanted to join the union because they were concerned about the overtime they are required to work and because they did not always get paid time and a half for overtime. The workers, who are paid $7 to $10 an hour on average, include cashiers, clerks, lottery machine operators, watchmen and warehouse employees at Hudson News operations at Pennsylvania Station, Grand Central Terminal, the World Trade Center, the Port Authority Bus Terminal and other locations in New York City.</p>
