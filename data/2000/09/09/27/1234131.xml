        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno and Director Louis J. Freeh of the F.B.I. defended their handling of the Wen Ho Lee case today, asserting in a Senate hearing that Dr. Lee had committed a serious crime when he removed what they called a portable library of atomic secrets from the weapons laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M.</p>
        <p>The two officials said they remained convinced that had Dr. Lee's case gone to trial federal prosecutors would have prevailed on each of the 59 counts of the indictment against him. But they agreed to a plea bargain, they said, based on several factors, principally that the government was the victim of ''graymail,'' which they described as a defense strategy that would have forced prosecutors to reveal ''extremely sensitive'' nuclear secrets if they brought Dr. Lee to trial.</p>
        <p>They said that Dr. Lee disclosed shortly before the plea bargain that he had not only downloaded the information onto computer tapes, but had also made copies of the tapes, a disclosure Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh said they regarded as ''frightening'' because it meant ''that at least 7 and as many as 14 or more tapes containing vast amounts of our nation's nuclear secrets remain unaccounted for.'' [Excerpts, Page A17.]</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh admitted that the government had made mistakes in its investigation, but neither expressed regret or doubts about the case, which ended two weeks ago when Dr. Lee pleaded guilty to a single felony charge of mishandling classified nuclear weapons data. He was freed after nine months behind bars.</p>
        <p>''Dr. Lee is no hero,'' Ms. Reno said. ''He is not an absent-minded professor. He is a felon. He committed a very serious calculated crime,  and he pled guilty to it.''</p>
        <p>In an unusual joint statement that was written at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh presented what was, in effect, their most complete and detailed rebuttal to date in response to complaints from the federal district judge in the case, James A. Parker, and President Clinton about whether the government had treated Dr. Lee unfairly.</p>
        <p>After the hearing, Dr. Lee's lawyers issued a statement on his behalf, saying: ''Notwithstanding the egregious pretrial conditions that were imposed on him, he still believes that our system of justice will prevail and he remains fully committed to honoring his obligations under the plea agreement with the government.''</p>
        <p>At the joint session of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, no senators disputed the importance of the information that Dr. Lee downloaded nor did any question the seriousness of the crime to which he pleaded guilty.</p>
        <p>But the debate over the information that Dr. Lee was accused of placing at risk continued today outside the hearing room when a former top government nuclear weapons designer who testified in Dr. Lee's defense only last month said that his remarks had been misinterpreted.</p>
        <p>In a detention hearing for Dr. Lee, the designer, John L. Richter, said that 99 percent of the data that Dr. Lee downloaded was unclassified.</p>
        <p>But today, in response to a reporter's questions, Mr. Richter, one of  several scientific experts who testified that the downloaded material was widely known, said in an interview that he meant his comments to apply only to the software and physics that underlie the computer codes that Dr. Lee downloaded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richter said his comments did not apply to other data that Dr. Lee removed, including information about the dimensions of weapons and about the physical properties of bomb materials.</p>
        <p>Still, lawmakers in both parties sharply criticized Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh for what they characterized as mismanagement of the case and missed opportunities in the inquiry and for their insistence on keeping Dr. Lee in solitary confinement -- and sometimes shackled -- in the months before the plea bargain.</p>
        <p>''This is a case in which there is very little, if any, good news to tell and plenty of blame to go around,'' said Senator Richard H. Bryan, Democrat of Nevada. ''The F.B.I., the Energy Department, the Justice Department all share the responsibility for the poor handling of this matter from the beginning, dating back to the early 1980's.''</p>
        <p>The complaints followed criticism from Judge Parker, who presided over the Lee case and called it a national embarrassment and from President Clinton, who said last week that he was troubled by the government's insistence on pretrial detention.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans expressed skepticism about Mr. Clinton's comments. Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the Intelligence Committee said: ''The president's statements criticizing the conduct of the prosecution, as if it was conducted by an entity beyond his control, was bizarre to say the least. The president knew exactly what was going on.''</p>
        <p>There was little opportunity for  senators to question Ms. Reno or Mr. Freeh at length in the hearing, the first time that either official had agreed to respond to lawmakers' criticisms in depth about the case -- which has drawn together Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh, whose relationship has long been frayed.</p>
        <p>The hearing was abruptly halted when Democrats invoked a Senate rule that limits committee hearings to two hours when the Senate is in session. The action was unrelated to the Lee case. Some Democrats asked for the action to protest what some have said was the Republicans' failure to approve judicial nominees, Congressional aides said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh disputed the conclusions of some senior nuclear weapons experts who have accused the government of exaggerating the case against Dr. Lee. The scientists have said that the information that Dr. Lee copied onto computer tapes was known throughout the rarified circles of nuclear weapons research.</p>
        <p>''Dr. Lee created his own secret portable, personal electronic library of this nation's nuclear secrets,'' Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh said in their joint statement. ''At the very least in doing so, he placed these secrets at extraordinary risk.''</p>
        <p>The two officials said that the material that Dr. Lee downloaded onto 10 computer tapes contained the ''electronic blueprints of the exact dimensions and geometry of this nation's nuclear weapons.''</p>
        <p>The data, they said, represented the ''complete nuclear weapons design capability of Los Alamos at the time -- approximately 50 years of nuclear weapons development, at the expense of hundreds of billions of dollars.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh sought to portray Dr. Lee as a scientist who, for still unexplained reasons, downloaded through computer systems a vast amount of data that was unrelated to his work. When he fell under suspicion, they said, he tried to conceal what he had done by deleting files from the laboratory's computers.</p>
        <p>The statement by Mr. Lee's lawyers did not respond to the specifics of the Reno-Freeh statement, and people familiar with the thinking of Dr. Lee's defense team said the lawyers needed time to assess the testimony. They also said he never intended to endanger national security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh, who read parts of the statement, said that when Dr. Lee realized he was the subject of a criminal investigation, he took several steps that heightened suspicion.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee removed classification markings from documents, the statement said, and repeatedly tried to enter secure areas of the laboratory  after his security clearance was revoked to engage in what the officials said was an effort to conceal his misuse of Los Alamos computers.</p>
        <p>''In order to achieve his ends, Dr. Lee had to override default mechanisms that were designed to prevent any accidental or inadvertent movement of those files,'' the statement said. ''His downloading process consumed nearly 40 hours over 70 different days.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richter's comments came after pullback came after T. J. Glauthier, the deputy Energy secretary, said at the hearing that the scientist's assertion in court that 99 percent of the data the former Los Alamos scientist had downloaded was unclassified was wrong.</p>
        <p>''That statement is not correct when applied to the totality of these files,'' Mr. Glauthier said of the characterization of the data.</p>
        <p>While physics and mathematical aspects of Dr. Lee's downloaded data do appear in the open literature, he added, ''the way they are assembled along with classified physical databases and specific weapons configurations, which are also on the tapes, is highly classified,'' Mr. Glauthier said.</p>
        <p>The tapes, he conceded, ''are not a complete recipe for designing and building a nuclear bomb.'' But the data ''represent the design know-how and physics information developed by our nuclear labs over a period of 50 years and over 1,000 nuclear tests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richter said in an interview today that he generally agreed with Mr. Glauthier's criticism.</p>
        <p>When he testified, Dr. Richter said, he meant to apply the 99-percent figure only to the software and physics that underlie the complex computer codes that Dr. Lee downloaded.</p>
        <p>''That's the software,'' he said of his testimony, adding that figure was ''probably an understatement'' in terms of its security banality.</p>
        <p>But beyond that, he said, lay two other areas where Dr. Lee had apparently downloaded secrets: the physical properties of bomb materials at high temperatures and pressures, and the engineering specifications and dimensions of the nuclear arms themselves.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richter said he had ''no way of knowing the proportion'' of secret to unclassified data in Dr. Lee's downloads since ''I did not have access'' to the downloaded data.</p>
        <p>Still, he maintained the government was exaggerating the significance of the downloading.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how it happened,'' he said, but somehow all the federal and prosecution experts ''got together and decided this is the worst thing that had ever happened.''</p>
