        <p>The Federal Trade Commission approved Boeing's $3.75 billion acquisition of Hughes Space and Communications yesterday after Boeing agreed to some conditions.</p>
        <p>The consent agreement removes one of the last obstacles to the further consolidation of the industry that builds and launches satellites for companies and government agencies.</p>
        <p>The European Commission, which has also been reviewing the proposed acquisition's effect on competition, is expected to approve the agreement. The Defense Department approved the transaction last month.</p>
        <p>The regulators had been concerned that Boeing would use its new dominance in the satellite-building business to push customers to its own rockets.</p>
        <p>According to a statement from the F.T.C., the agreement prohibits Boeing's launching vehicle division from ''gaining access to nonpublic information that its satellite division receives from competing suppliers that launch Boeing satellites.''</p>
        <p>A similar firewall would prevent Boeing's satellite division from passing on to the rocket builders any information about other makers of launching vehicles. In addition, the agreement requires Boeing to provide competing satellite manufacturers with the specifications needed to make their products compatible with Boeing launching vehicles.</p>
        <p>An additional condition of the agreement prohibits Boeing ''from providing systems engineering and technical support'' to the Defense Department for an unidentified classified program for which Boeing and Hughes had once been competing contractors.</p>
        <p>The commercial satellite market is expanding rapidly; a Boeing spokesman last night estimated that the market for information and communication services, of which satellites make up a substantial part, is $40 billion to $60 billion and is expected to grow to $120 billion by 2005. Among the major customers are commercial and government-owned telecommunication companies.</p>
        <p>The market for launching vehicles, the company spokesman said, is $4 billion to $6 billion annually.</p>
        <p>The agreement named Sheila E. Widnall, a former secretary of the Air Force and a professor of aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as a monitor trustee to help the F.T.C. ensure compliance with the terms of its approval.</p>
        <p>Hughes Space and Communications, a subsidiary of the General Motors Corporation, has been a major supplier of satellite networks for  United States intelligence agencies. It has also moved aggressively in the fast-growing commercial satellite market, building dozens of satellites valued at $100 million to $200 million each.</p>
