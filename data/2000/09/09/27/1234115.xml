        <p>The court that will next hear the appeal of the government's antitrust case against Microsoft has dealt with some of the company's legal arguments in the past, handing the company its most significant victory before today.</p>
        <p>In 1998, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision ordering Microsoft to take its Internet Explorer Web browser out of its Windows 95 operating system.</p>
        <p>Two of the judges in that case remain among the seven judges who will now hear the appeal.</p>
        <p>On one level, the 1998 decision was a pyrrhic victory for Microsoft because it prompted the government to substantially expand its case and find more evidence to help Judge Jackson justify his findings that the company had violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.</p>
        <p>But Judge Jackson may have alienated a number of appeals court judges earlier this year when he sharply criticized the appeals court ruling and said that the judges who had reversed him had ignored Supreme Court precedents.</p>
        <p>Last June, the appeals court showed that it was eager to take the present case, declaring that the entire court, not a three-judge panel, would hear the company's appeal.</p>
        <p>Without explanation, 3 of the 10 judges on  the court have disqualified themselves from considering the Microsoft case. The other seven have indicated their intention to handle the case expeditiously.</p>
        <p>The court, which because of its location often finds itself adjudicating politically charged cases, has in recent years been ideologically split among appointees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush and those of Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter.</p>
        <p>But on issues presented in the antitrust case, party affiliation is a notoriously poor barometer.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, a Reagan appointee viewed as a judicial conservative, wound up siding entirely with the Clinton administration and against Microsoft on every major point of fact and law.</p>
        <p>The complete panel of the appeals court has heard relatively few antitrust cases.</p>
        <p>Here is a look at the seven judges of the appeals court, in order of their seniority, who will be participating in the Microsoft case:</p>
        <p>HARRY T. EDWARDS -- Appointed in February 1980, he became the chief judge in 1994. Judge Edwards has taught at Michigan and Harvard Law Schools and was chairman of Amtrak. He is an expert in labor law, and before joining the bench had been an arbitrator in a number of collective bargaining disputes.</p>
        <p>STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS -- Appointed in June 1986. One of the two judges in the court who issued the ruling in 1998 on Microsoft's Web browser. Before being appointed to the bench, Judge Williams was an assistant United States attorney in New York and a professor at the University of Colorado School of Law.</p>
        <p>DOUGLAS H. GINSBURG -- Appointed in October 1986. The former head of the antitrust division at the Justice Department in the Reagan administration, Judge Ginsburg has also taught antitrust law at Harvard Law School and is considered one of the leading authorities on the subject at the appeals court. President Reagan announced his intention to nominate Judge Ginsburg to the Supreme Court in 1987 after the Senate's refusal to confirm Robert Bork. But Judge Ginsburg withdrew his name nine days later after disclosures that he had used marijuana while he was a professor at Harvard.</p>
        <p>DAVID B. SENTELLE -- Appointed in October 1987. A former state judge from North Carolina, Judge Sentelle became nationally known for his role on a special court overseeing the independent counsel and his involvement in the decision to appoint Kenneth W. Starr to be the Whitewater prosecutor.</p>
        <p>A. RAYMOND RANDOLPH -- Appointed in July 1990. A top official in the solicitor general's office in the Nixon and Ford administrations, Judge Randolph argued more than 20 cases at the Supreme Court. An important adviser to Mr. Bork during his unsuccessful confirmation proceedings, Judge Randolph is known for being among the more conservative members of the court. Judge Randolph participated with Judge Williams in the earlier Microsoft decision.</p>
        <p>JUDITH W. ROGERS -- Appointed in March 1994. A career government lawyer, Judge Rogers served as a trial lawyer at the Justice Department, general counsel for a Congressional commission and corporation counsel for the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>DAVID S. TATEL -- Appointed in October 1994. Before joining the bench, Judge Tatel had a long career as a civil rights lawyer, serving in the Carter administration as the director of the office of civil rights at what was then known as the Health, Education and Welfare Department. Before that he director of the National Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.</p>
