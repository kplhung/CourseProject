        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair took personal blame today for government actions that have sent the Labor Party's resilient poll ratings plummeting this month, but he urged the party to have confidence that it would defeat the Conservatives and win a second term in the election expected in the next year.</p>
        <p>''I'm the prime minister that's supposed to be the great reader of public opinion,'' he said at the party's annual convention in this English Channel resort in a speech aimed at restoring his battered reputation. ''After the events of two weeks ago, it's no wonder the government has taken a knock. It happened on my watch, and I take responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair was referring to a spontaneous fuel price protest by farmers and truckers that attracted widespread public support and provoked broad criticism of Mr. Blair -- who has long been credited with having his finger on the public pulse -- for being highhanded and out of touch. ''I am listening,'' he said pointedly. ''I hear, and I will act.''</p>
        <p>He also conceded that two other high-profile moves had been mistakes: a 75 pence ($1.10) increase last year in the weekly state pension, which was scorned by recipients as miserly, and the government's pet Millennium Dome project in London, which has drawn far fewer people and cost far more money than expected.</p>
        <p>Uttering the phrase ''75p,'' which has become the protest chant of pensioners, who now make up nearly 25 percent of the British electorate, Mr. Blair said, ''I tell you now, we get the message.''</p>
        <p>As for the dome, he commented, ''Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time again I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn't try to run big visitor attractions.''</p>
        <p>The delegates to what was supposed to have been a rally to kick off an election campaign have been bewildered at their party's swift loss of public approval, and they enthusiastically greeted Mr. Blair's unaccustomed expressions of contrition. ''Yes,'' he said to an outburst of applause, ''there are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough, honest enough to admit it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair delivered his address vigorously, with sweat visibly staining the front of his blue shirt and running down his forehead. He spoke with the furrowed-brow intensity, distant visionary gaze and trembling voice that have roused the faithful in the past while bringing scorn from critics who mock his oratorical skills as more suitable for the pulpit than the stump.</p>
        <p>The mood in the hall was upbeat, with delegates clapping their hands before Mr. Blair's arrival to the rhythmic conference theme song, Canned Heat's ''Let's Work Together.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair is expected to call the next election for May, and today's speech was filled with campaign-style attacks on the Tories, who have found themselves ahead of Labor in the polls this month for the first time since 1992. The Conservative leader, William Hague, has sought to capitalize on the recent Labor blunders, but Mr. Blair dismissed the sudden gains as transitory. ''Opportunism always knocks for Mr. Hague,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair proclaimed a long list of social progress accomplishments by Labor and contended that the Conservatives had opposed all of them and would reverse them if voted back into power. He portrayed himself as a ''unifier, a builder of consensus'' and Mr. Hague as someone seeking short-term advantage by dividing.</p>
        <p>''If people want me to go out and exploit the asylum issue for reasons of race,'' he said in a biting reference to Conservative calls for immigration restrictions, ''then vote for the other man, because I won't do it.''</p>
        <p>Since Labor's rout of the Tories in 1997, Mr. Blair has devoted his conference addresses to warning the party of the responsibilities of managing success and the dangers of triumphalism and complacency. Today, he had the very different mission of restoring Labor's confidence in its prospects for re-election -- considered a certainty until the recent fall in popularity -- and repairing his own standing with the growing number of critics, including many in his own party, who find him smug and sanctimonious.</p>
        <p>He said it was not arrogance but the need to make tough choices that held him back from responding directly to the fuel protesters' demand for tax breaks and the pensioners' call for greater participation in Britain's current prosperity. He said he would never sacrifice public services for a voter-pleasing tax cut.</p>
        <p>''It's not an arrogant government that chooses priorities,'' he said. ''It's an irresponsible government that fails to choose.''</p>
