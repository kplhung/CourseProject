        <p>The Fox network's decision not to cover next month's presidential debates and to supplant them on two nights with offerings like ''Dark Angel'' and ''That 70's Show'' marks  the first time that a full-fledged broadcast network will use entertainment shows to counterprogram the debates.</p>
        <p>It will also be the first time that two presidential debates will have just as many networks not broadcasting them as broadcasting them.</p>
        <p>In addition to the three presidential debates, Fox will skip the one vice presidential debate. On two nights the debates conflict with baseball playoff games that Fox is under contract to broadcast.</p>
        <p>Networks have passed on debate coverage several times previously  because of commitments to baseball. The explanation is that games cannot be moved to other nights while entertainment can always be rescheduled. NBC News will skip two of the debates because of baseball commitments on Oct. 3 and Oct. 17.</p>
        <p>Those are the two nights on which Fox will broadcast entertainment shows rather than the debates. The result will be debates on two networks, ABC and CBS, and competing sports and entertainment on NBC and Fox.</p>
        <p>The Presidential Debate Commission says it schedules the debates to ensure blanket coverage by the networks so that the widest number of people can see them. While many cable channels offer entertainment alternatives, the broadcasters, because their stations receive licenses from the government to use the public airwaves, have always been expected to do everything possible to give the debates the widest possible coverage.</p>
        <p>Network executives said that the debate commission had worked hard to avoid the sports conflicts. No debates are being held on Monday nights, for example, which would have forced ABC to drop out because of ''Monday Night Football,'' competition the commission seems to fear more than baseball playoffs. What was unexpected was that one network would opt out of the debates even when it did not have a sports conflict.</p>
        <p>Fox covered the debates on nonsports nights in 1992 and 1996. It also regularly pre-empts its entertainment schedule for news events like the State of the Union Address. Fox still plans to drop its entertainment schedule to cover election night.</p>
        <p>But the network pulled out of the debates entirely this year, said Jeff DeRome, a spokesman for Fox, after  the decision mainly came down to the commitment Fox has to the show ''Dark Angel,'' one of the most expensive series the network has ever produced.</p>
        <p>For months Fox has heavily promoted the premiere of ''Dark Angel,'' an action series, even though it was scheduled for a date picked long ago as a likely one for a debate. ABC had also widely promoted the premiere of ''Gideon's Crossing'' for that date but delayed it by one night  after Oct. 3 was confirmed as the date of the first debate.</p>
        <p>Fox has asked its affiliated stations to push back their news broadcasts a full hour on Oct. 3 to accommodate the special two-hour premiere of ''Dark Angel.'' Fox has no special premiere on the night of Oct. 17, but with its baseball commitments it would have faced the prospect of keeping ''Dark Angel'' off the air for up to four weeks if it chose to carry the debate that night, endangering the chances of ''Dark Angel'' to be a hit.</p>
        <p>Fox executives also emphasized that the decision not to carry the debates was intended partly to underscore the company's support for the Fox News Channel, which will carry all the debates on cable. That channel is not seen at all in 40 million homes. It has a regular audience of 400,000 households, a small fraction of the millions who regularly tune into the Fox network.</p>
        <p>NBC, which also has its own news channel on cable, MSNBC, will carry the debates on that network on the nights it does not have baseball.</p>
        <p>The debates will be carried by other outlets, including CNN, PBS and C-Span. But on Oct. 3 and Oct. 17, the debates stand a chance of being beaten in terms of total viewers by baseball on NBC and ''Dark Angel'' on Fox. That would also be a first.</p>
