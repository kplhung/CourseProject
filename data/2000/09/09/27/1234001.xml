      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>THE Mortimer's era is officially over. And Orsay has put the period on the sentence. Glenn Bernbaum, Mortimer's notoriously highhanded and cranky owner, made sure the restaurant would not survive him. He arranged to have the name retired at his death, two years ago, and barred his former employees from operating a restaurant on the premises. Undeterred, they moved two blocks south and created Swifty's, where the spirit of Mortimer's has migrated with surprising ease, along with the Mortimer's ''in'' crowd. In the meantime, the partners who run La Goulue bought Mr. Bernbaum's building, transformed it into a French brasserie and, in a final dismantling of the Mortimer's legacy, are serving very good food. Mr. Bernbaum must be wincing at the very thought of it.</p>
        <p>Orsay is a brasserie with a difference, although there's nothing in the look of the place to suggest anything out of the ordinary. In fact, the restaurant looks as if it was ordered from a kit, with a lot of shiny brass, pristine leather banquettes, sparkling mirrors and authentic French waiter costumes. Somewhere, there must be a central supply house with a full-color catalog for New York's restaurateurs. Pastis sent away for the Provincial Cafe (Model 2992), paying a surcharge for the nicotine stains and cracked plaster. The owners of Orsay opted for Paris Brasserie, circa 1890. Disturbingly, it does feel very French in an exuberantly fake way.</p>

        <p>Orsay is a brasserie with a difference, although there's nothing in the look of the place to suggest anything out of the ordinary. In fact, the restaurant looks as if it was ordered from a kit, with a lot of shiny brass, pristine leather banquettes, sparkling mirrors and authentic French waiter costumes. Somewhere, there must be a central supply house with a full-color catalog for New York's restaurateurs. Pastis sent away for the Provincial Cafe (Model 2992), paying a surcharge for the nicotine stains and cracked plaster. The owners of Orsay opted for Paris Brasserie, circa 1890. Disturbingly, it does feel very French in an exuberantly fake way.</p>
        <p>The cuisine does not follow the script. Orchestrated by Philippe Schmit, the executive chef at La Goulue, it has a fresh, wayward bent and an international style that saves Orsay from being yet one more exercise in French nostalgia. Even the old standbys, more often than not, veer off in unexpected directions. Two healthy rougets, their skin grilled to potato-chip crunchiness, get a lift from the feather-light anchovy mayonnaise and four golden sticks of fried pureed potato touched with a hint of cumin. A scoop of crab salad, nothing more than pristine bits of meat freshened with flecks of mint, looks winsome on the plate, but there's no way to overlook the flashy redhead that comes with it, a hot-colored, ice-cold sorbet with a throbbing tomato flavor.</p>
        <p>A whiff of vanilla adds richness and complexity to thick pink slices of salmon with a black pepper crust, but that's only the beginning of the adventure, salmon-wise, at Orsay. In a special section of the menu devoted to tartares, one's eye alights on a very strange dish labeled ''le Britannique,'' with a shocking list of ingredients that includes Stilton, walnuts and Yorkshire pudding. I ordered with fear in my heart, but the Britannique is a triumph, a timbale of succulent salmon nuggets with nearly invisible bits of Stilton and walnut delicately interwoven to create a lovely interplay of unexpected flavors. The Yorkshire pudding beats anything I've had in England. Less successful, although cleverly presented, was a tuna tartare flavored with tequila and cilantro and served in a silver goblet with a salted rim and a lime slice. Tequila doesn't do a whole lot for tuna.</p>
        <p>Another area of the menu worth lingering over showcases Orsay's hickory-chip smoker, which gives a dark, woodsy bite to salmon that's half-smoked, then grilled and served with eggplant chutney. Dense, deeply flavored duck sausage gets the full-smoke treatment. Served with a rustic potato tart and aged goat cheese, it makes a full-throttle cold-weather starter.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough in this traditional setting, it's the traditional brasserie and bistro dishes that disappoint. Hanger steak is ordinary and rather tough. The T-bone is a better bet, but it is strictly a meat-and-potatoes affair. Braised veal short ribs, tender and flavorful, get bogged down a bit in a sticky-sweet sauce. Filet mignon, buttery-textured and enrobed in a thick pink-peppercorn sauce, hits it just right.</p>
        <p>Gilles Ballay, the pastry chef, plays his hand a little more conservatively than Mr. Schmit, limiting his flights of fancy to small embellishments. He shrewdly plops a scoop of tamarillo sorbet next to his very fine fig tart. Piquant and acidic, the tamarillo helps to cut the gooey sweetness of the figs. His restrained raspberry napoleon, with just a few pastry layers defining the form, is a perfectly executed classic. Warm apple tart is flawless, but the prune and Armagnac ice cream that comes with it is almost fiery with alcohol, and Black Forest cherry cake may be one of those desserts best left to the Germans and Austrians.</p>
        <p>The Upper East Side, like a nervous poodle, can be finicky in strange ways. It's very hard to know when food matters to the well-tended, well-traveled and insular group that moves at its higher reaches. Did they embrace Le Cirque for the cooking or for Sirio Maccioni? The same people who dote on Daniel ate the food at Mortimer's with every appearance of pleasure. It's all very puzzling, but one thing is clear: on the Upper East Side, when you're in, you're in. And Orsay, with a team from La Goulue that obviously knows the territory, is definitely in. The right sort of people, after some preliminary sniffing around, have obviously decided that Orsay is O.K. In another year or so, they may even notice that you can't get meatloaf at 75th and Lex anymore.</p>
