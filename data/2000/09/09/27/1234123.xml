        <p>When WNNY-AM (1380) turns on its microphones today at noon, it will become the New York region's first all-news, all-the-time Spanish-language radio station.

        <p>When WNNY-AM (1380) turns on its microphones today at noon, it will become the New York region's first all-news, all-the-time Spanish-language radio station. To many industry analysts, that is a sign of advertiser interest in the growing buying power of the nation's Hispanic listeners.</p>
        <p>Mega Communications, a privately owned Hispanic radio conglomerate, recently bought the station, which had been known as WDKM, in a deal valued at $45 million. It then  changed its call letters to WNNY, and switched its programming from  Spanish music to all news.</p>
        <p>WNNY will have a news staff of about 40 people and broadcast a program similar to that of WINS-AM (1010) and WCBS-AM (880).</p>
        <p>There are already five radio stations catering to New York's Spanish speakers, and industry experts say they and WNNY could generate an estimated $85 million in annual advertising revenues. The five existing stations already capture about 10 percent of the region's radio listeners.</p>
        <p>Several radio industry analysts said that the station, which has already hired some high-profile Hispanic broadcasters, is likely to pose a threat to the existing Spanish-language stations. While WNNY has only a 5,000-megawatt signal, it easily reaches areas of Upper Manhattan, the Bronx and northern New Jersey that have dense clusters of Hispanic residents, company officials said. Stations like all-news WCBS and WINS, as well as the Spanish station WADO-AM (1280) transmit at 50,000 megawatts.</p>
        <p>''One in five people in New York is of Hispanic origin,'' Adam Lindemann, the president of Mega Communications, said in an interview yesterday. ''One in 10 stations in New York are Spanish, so if you just correlate radio stations with population, there are about half as many as there should be.''</p>
        <p>James Marsh, an analyst at Prudential Securities, said that there was some concern about whether WNNY's 5,000-megawatt transmitter had the power to draw enough listeners, and fear that advertising revenue might be drying up across the board. But Mr. Marsh said that returns in the radio industry had been fairly favorable, especially in the Hispanic market, to which advertisers were increasingly turning.</p>
        <p>The strength of Mega Communications seems to be a testament to that, he said. The company, based in Silver Spring, Md., has grown in four short years from a fledgling startup to the country's fourth-largest Hispanic radio broadcaster, boasting 20 stations, all on the East Coast.</p>
        <p>The company has invested about $5 million in WNNY, officials said. It also plans to simulcast with streaming audio on the Internet, officials said.</p>
        <p>The station's most fearsome competition, Mr. Marsh said, will most likely come from WADO, with its long-established news and talk programming. .</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindemann said Mega Communications decided that it would be easier competing against WADO  than trying to break into the more crowded Spanish music market.</p>
        <p>''I can't play salsa and merengue music, as we do at our other stations, because tropical formats are already taken in New York,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said that the company's research suggested that many Spanish listeners were interested in news geared more to them. The success of the Spanish music and talk stations in luring advertisers and the success of WINS and WCBS have made it easier to persuade advertisers to sign on, he added.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 28, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about the first all-news Spanish-language radio station in the New York region misstated the transmitter power of the station, WNNY-AM (1380), and others in the region. WNNY has a signal of 5,000 watts, not megawatts. The much larger WCBS-AM (880), WINS (1010), and WADO-AM (1280) have signals of 50,000 watts, not megawatts.</p>
