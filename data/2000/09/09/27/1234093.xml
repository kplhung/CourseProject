        <p>On an unbeaten Jets team that is making fourth-quarter comebacks commonplace, the quarterback complains that people are focusing on the first three quarters and not the last.</p>
        <p>And his coach is complaining that so much has been made of these improbable comebacks that people are forgetting about the defense.</p>
        <p>Who can blame Coach Al Groh for wanting to crow about the defensive unit? He is a defensive-minded man, who used to be the Jets' linebackers coach. And his Jets, in addition to starting 4-0, have done something else that no other team in club history has accomplished -- they've held opponents to fewer than 20 points in each game.</p>
        <p>Not even the Jets' 1968-69 Super Bowl team was so stingy so early. That high-powered outfit, which boasted several Pro Bowl defenders, was touched for 20 or more points three times in its first four games.</p>
        <p>Only two other N.F.L. teams have not allowed 20 or more points in a game this season -- the Giants and the Dolphins, both 3-1. The Jets' defense has been so effective through the first quarter of the season that it has allowed its offense plenty of time to get its bearings and produce three fourth-quarter comebacks.</p>
        <p>Going into the season, there were questions about the Jets' defense, partly because it was being coached by a new staff. Mike Nolan took over as defensive coordinator after Bill Belichick, the brilliant tactician, had departed for New England.</p>
        <p>Also, two rookies who were first-round draft picks, Shaun Ellis and John Abraham, were being counted on to sack the quarterback, and maybe even produce a double-digit sack season -- something a Jet defender hasn't done since 1995.</p>
        <p>The Jets did not even have a starting free safety until Kevin Williams emerged a week before the season opened -- less than a year after an insidious infection nearly killed him. And the defensive line remains a no-name group: the unheralded Rick Lyle at left end and Shane Burton on the right, and the more noticeable Jason Ferguson at nose tackle.</p>
        <p>''I appreciate the importance of quarterbacks to the N.F.L., and trick plays, but it goes back to the statement I have on the wall back there in the locker room: 'If you don't play good defense, you're going to lose,' '' Groh said. ''Right now, our team is playing good defense.''</p>
        <p>Groh assessed his defensive unit as ''physically tough and, I think, very alert to game situations.''</p>
        <p>Linebacker Marvin Jones may be the defense's standout player. He is on a pace to produce nearly 160 tackles, an astounding number. So far he has been in on 39, including 29 solo tackles. His previous season high for total tackles is 127.</p>
        <p>Some of the players complained this summer about Groh's drill-sergeant practices that left them waiting in line at the water buckets. But now, with the games on the line, the defense has proved stronger in almost every instance than the opposition's offense.</p>
        <p>The Jets have been producing sacks in these clutch second halves. For all of last season, the Jets had 26 sacks. They have 11 so far, led by Ellis's three and Abraham's two and a half.</p>
        <p>''On an offensive possession, the sack decreases the likelihood of a score by 35 percent,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>As for those summer practices, Ferguson, the portly nose tackle, was one of the players who did not look too happy as Groh poured it on. But he survived those one-on-one drills in which he had to get past center Kevin Mawae, or sweated as Curtis Martin ran into him.</p>
        <p>''All the practices made us mentally strong,'' Ferguson said. ''We've learned to gut it out.''</p>
        <p>Actually, Groh's practices are similar in at least one way to Bill Parcells's: brains as well as brawn are involved. Both create hypothetical situations in practice -- first-and-goal from the 5, say, with 32 seconds left. What's your call? Everyone is thinking about that.</p>
        <p>''What we've been through -- that'll prepare us for the end of the season,'' Ferguson said.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely, practices got us ready for the most crucial parts of the games -- third down and two minutes,'' cornerback Marcus Coleman said. ''Whenever we're in that situation, we know what we have to do.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>For the third straight week, the Jets have captured the National Football League's award for play of the week. The latest was for CURTIS MARTIN's last-minute, winning touchdown pass to WAYNE CHREBET, a halfback-option toss that sank the Buccaneers. The week before it was MARCUS COLEMAN, a defender who lined up as a wide receiver and caught VINNY TESTAVERDE's desperate 45-yard touchdown pass to close out the first half against the Buffalo Bills. In Week 2 of the season, Chrebet's  fourth-quarter contortionist catch for a 28-yard touchdown pass from Testaverde gave the Jets a Monday-night victory against the New England Patriots. . . . AL GROH, like many coaches, divides the season into quarters. With a bye week preceding the start of the next quarter, Groh warned: ''We're starting the second quarter of the season at 0-0.'' He pointed out that the Jets open the second quarter against the struggling Pittsburgh Steelers, but then face three division rivals: New England, Miami and Buffalo. . . .</p>
        <p>The Jets' eight-game winning streak, dating to last season, is currently the longest in the league.</p>
