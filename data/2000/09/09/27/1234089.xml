        <p>First came the elephants, with ears flapping and trunks swinging. Then came the antelope, skittish and shy, dancing on slender hooves.</p>
        <p>About 200 people -- cabinet ministers, military officers, businessmen and journalists -- dropped by last week to welcome the 33 animals that were flown from South Africa earlier this month to inhabit Quicama National Park, Angola's first game reserve.</p>
        <p>''We want, with this eloquent gesture, to demonstrate our solidarity with nature and to bring beauty back to one of the most important parks in the country,'' Fatima Jardim, the minister of fisheries and environment, said at last week's ceremony.</p>
        <p>The announcement inevitably left some people dubious. Animal rights activists in South Africa howled about the potential dangers of poachers and land mines. Some Western diplomats worried that the animals would be eaten by hungry Angolans. (Angola, which suffers from severe shortages of food, understandably runs short of optimism on most days.) Still, the story was big news in this war-ravaged country, where people long for distractions from the grinding hardships of daily living.</p>
        <p>Radio soap operas draw huge audiences here and entire communities turn out each year to elect local beauty queens. On the day that the crowd gathered to watch the antelope, for instance, hundreds lined up to see 16 young women in tiny bikinis and sparkling high heels compete for the title of Miss Luanda.</p>
        <p>''It's a way for us to see that Angola isn't just about war,'' said Amelia Veloso, 25, who sat in the audience. ''It's a way for us to feel like we have culture and we're part of the world.''</p>
        <p>Older people still proudly remember the days when thousands of elephants, buffalo and antelope wandered through the three-million acre reserve, which was established in 1938 and sits just 43 miles outside Luanda, the capital.</p>
        <p>They remember too how the animals were killed and stolen after the civil war began in 1975 by soldiers, hunters and the hungry. Today the vast expanse of grasslands and thickets are almost bereft of big game.</p>
        <p>''Everything had been shot and poached and killed,'' said Wouter van Houven, the president of the Kissama Foundation, the nonprofit group that manages the park.</p>
        <p>The foundation built a fence and hired guards to protect the 15 elephants, 10 kudu and 8 eland. They were donated by South Africa, which has a surplus of the animals. As the animals were flown in on several flights, Mr. van Houven found himself defending the project.</p>
        <p>No, there aren't any land mines in  the park, he insisted. No, there aren't rebels fighting nearby. And no, the government is not wasting public money. The foundation, he said, relies entirely on private donations.</p>
        <p>There was one fatality, however. One elephant stumbled as the cargo plane was landing, fell on her sternum and suffocated. Undeterred, foundation officials say they still plan to import 300 elephants from Botswana next year.</p>
        <p>Someday, they hope, foreign tourists will fill luxury lodges on the banks of the nearby Cuanza River. This month, however, the crowd was made up of Angolans eager for a bit of good news.</p>
        <p>''The day that we offloaded those elephants, some people stood there crying,'' said Mr. van Houven, who is also a professor of wildlife management at the University of Pretoria in South Africa. ''The rest stood with their mouths open with awe because they've never seen a live elephant.''</p>
