        <p>It's probably fitting that Takeshi Kitano goes by the nickname Aniki in his yakuza spectacular ''Brother'' because he stirs up some serious anarchy on the Los Angeles crime scene. Mr. Kitano directed, edited and wrote ''Brother'' (aniki is Japanese for brother), and his style of close-to-the-vest brutality travels extremely well.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it's because he's sharp enough to use the two settings of the picture -- Los Angeles and Tokyo -- for their physical and spiritual connotations. Los Angeles is all wide open spaces. Tokyo is dense and intimate, with gangsters seemingly nose to nose. (The orchestral jazz score by Joe Hisaishi, has the roomy lilt of the compositions by Maria Schneider; it's lovely and powerful.) And Tokyo is where Yamamoto (Mr. Kitano) is far more demonstrative and angry than he is when he's in America.</p>

        <p>It's probably fitting that Takeshi Kitano goes by the nickname Aniki in his yakuza spectacular ''Brother'' because he stirs up some serious anarchy on the Los Angeles crime scene. Mr. Kitano directed, edited and wrote ''Brother'' (aniki is Japanese for brother), and his style of close-to-the-vest brutality travels extremely well.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it's because he's sharp enough to use the two settings of the picture -- Los Angeles and Tokyo -- for their physical and spiritual connotations. Los Angeles is all wide open spaces. Tokyo is dense and intimate, with gangsters seemingly nose to nose. (The orchestral jazz score by Joe Hisaishi, has the roomy lilt of the compositions by Maria Schneider; it's lovely and powerful.) And Tokyo is where Yamamoto (Mr. Kitano) is far more demonstrative and angry than he is when he's in America.</p>
        <p>The mournful Mr. Kitano, who goes by the sobriquet Beat Takeshi, actually looks more like that nickname than ever; he's exhausted by the burden of keeping the code of honor in the underworld on two different continents. It's the way that screen icons age to become more vivid versions of themselves, and Mr. Kitano's evolution has demanded that he reduce himself even more, given that he's channeling Clint Eastwood through Toshiro Mifune with a little bit of Buster Keaton thrown in to keep the mix from crashing under its own ponderous weight.</p>
        <p>At this rate, one wonders if Mr. Kitano will even bother to open his eyes in his next movie (though in films directed by others, he doesn't rely chiefly on the tortured minimalism). By this time, his right cheek jumps like Michigan J. Frog, a twitch that shows the strain in containing his own sad implacability while mayhem goes on about him. (He's often the cause of the mayhem.) Mr. Kitano walks with his head down slightly; it's not a retiring gait, but rather a guarded one that says if you're looking for trouble, you've come to the right place.</p>
        <p>Aniki ends up in the United States, fleeing waves of trouble left in his wake in Japan, where the murder of his boss has caused a gang war. Packing up his steamer trunk of black Yohji Yamamoto wool crepe suits and  silk work shirts -- which make him look like the world's most malevolent agent -- he transplants himself to Los Angeles, where his half-brother Ken (Claude Maki) is a small-time drug dealer who runs with a crew of lowlifes who seem to be even worse at a criminal lifestyle thanhe is.</p>
        <p>Soon, Aniki has raised the roof on Ken's drug business -- eliminating the competition with breathtaking cruelty -- and shown his younger sibling that, yes, loosely translated, ''yakuza'' means gangsta. Aniki and his new world pickup crew are dropping some old world vengeance on any pack of criminals in their way and setting into motion the kind of forces that will demand addressing.</p>
        <p>Despite the violence in his films, Mr. Kitano is a rigid moralist, and a karmic retribution usually takes place in most of his work. That Zen-like attention to the cosmic scales can feel a little monotonous and too heavily worked out -- a Post-It carved in stone. Though this is territory that Mr. Kitano has covered before, he underlines the differences between Japan and the United States to make dramatic points and give his solemn toughness a context. And at the oddest times, a noise somewhere between a chortle and giggle escapes from his lips and a twinkle dances in his manly squint.</p>
        <p>He lightens up as he becomes closer to Ken and like a brother to Ken's mates, and gets very close to Denny (Omar Epps). Their bond becomes a source of humor, given the unusual way they met. When Kato  goes to Los Angeles to join Aniki, the ''family'' is complete and he takes to dressing them in Yohji finery as well. Unfortunately, they get the kind with contrasting lapel highlights that make them look like part of a Color Me Badd reunion tour.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kitano often plays around with the theme of the only man left on earth with a shred of integrity -- a Gary Cooper who shoots first -- and in ''Brother'' he's so distanced that he barely speaks; he has no dialogue in the first five minutes of the film. That's probably because much of the movie takes place in English, a language he's obviously uncomfortable with. The American actors are left, it seems, to improvise their own dialogue around the framework Mr. Kitano gave them.</p>
        <p>This works well more often than not. The scenes between Kato and Jay (Royale Watkins), who develop a competitive and squabbling relationship, have a goofy warmth. The basketball scenes are especially good, although there are other times when the actors stand around, unsure of what to do.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kitano's scenes with Mr. Epps have an intriguing give-and-take, with the exception of an extended last scene that is all too clearly -- and badly -- improvised by Mr. Epps alone. If the film had ended a couple of scenes earlier, on a touch that's a tribute to  westerns and showdowns, Mr. Kitano would have finished things off beautifully. But that's a minor quibble.</p>
