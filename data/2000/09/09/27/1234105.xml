        <p>The vigorous, once athletic man who was pushed into the path of an oncoming subway train faced his attacker yesterday in a Manhattan courtroom, and in a clear voice recounted how he had awoken in a hospital to find that his legs had been severed.</p>
        <p>The victim, Edgar Rivera, 37, testified that he had no recollection of the attack on April 28, 1999, or even the days that preceded it. ''I remember at some point waking up,'' he said, ''and slowly realizing that I no longer had legs.''</p>

        <p>The vigorous, once athletic man who was pushed into the path of an oncoming subway train faced his attacker yesterday in a Manhattan courtroom, and in a clear voice recounted how he had awoken in a hospital to find that his legs had been severed.</p>
        <p>The victim, Edgar Rivera, 37, testified that he had no recollection of the attack on April 28, 1999, or even the days that preceded it. ''I remember at some point waking up,'' he said, ''and slowly realizing that I no longer had legs.''</p>
        <p>At that point, Mr. Rivera began to cry. He took a moment to compose himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera was testifying at the State Supreme Court trial of Julio  Perez, 44, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to a charge of attempted murder. Mr. Perez sat quietly at the defense table with his court-appointed lawyers.</p>
        <p>The two men were strangers when Mr. Perez stepped into a crowd of commuters at 5:30 p.m.and thrust Mr. Rivera onto the tracks, just as a No. 6 train entered the Lexington Avenue station at 51st Street.</p>
        <p>It was the end of a daily routine for Mr. Rivera, a father of three who lives on Soundview Avenue in the Bronx and worked as a messenger for a copy shop. He spent three months recovering at Bellevue Hospital Center and is learning to use prosthetic legs, although he said in court, ''After five minutes of being on them, it's too exhausting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perez's lawyers, who have acknowledged that their client carried out the attack, argued on Monday in opening statements that he  was mentally ill at the time and had a 20-year history of paranoid schizophrenia, for which he had been taking medication. He was, however, found competent to stand trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera's testimony was brief. Afterward, he parked his wheelchair in the lobby of the Criminal Courts Building on Centre Street, sipped a cup of coffee and described the experience of seeing Mr. Perez, the man who had changed Mr. Rivera's life forever in a moment of random violence.</p>
        <p>''It's just incredible to sit there and look at a man who did so much damage to me,'' said Mr. Rivera, who was joined by his wife, Elizabeth, and his best friend, Noel Moreno. ''I looked at him. He looked at me. He showed no emotion.''</p>
        <p>As an afterthought, he added, ''It made me feel emotional.''</p>
        <p>Recent acts of violence, including subway pushings and attacks with bricks, by people with a history of mental illness have focused a spotlight on the inadequacies of the city's safety net of social services.  When he shoved Mr. Rivera in front of the train, Mr. Perez was living in a shelter for the homeless in Washington Heights and was being treated for schizophrenia at a program run by New York Presbyterian Hospital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera is suing the hospital and the shelter in civil court, contending that they failed to take adequate steps to treat Mr. Perez, despite numerous signs that he was unstable.</p>
        <p>Since the attack, Mr. Rivera has shown resilience and has taken a charitable view of Mr. Perez's problems. He reiterated that view yesterday, saying that he had become an advocate for the mentally ill.</p>
        <p>''This is not just about him or me or my legs,'' he said. ''It's about public safety and the state's and city's policy for caring for people with mental illness.''</p>
        <p>He said he planned to attend the remainder of the trial and had no particular stake in the outcome.</p>
        <p>''If, in fact, I did hate that man, that would determine what justice would mean for me,'' he said. ''If the man is suffering from a mental illness, my wish and hope would be that he get the treatment that could remedy his problem.''</p>
