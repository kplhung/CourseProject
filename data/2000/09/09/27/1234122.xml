        <p>A Suffolk County woman died when her vehicle collided with a gasoline tanker outside a service station here Monday night, setting off a fiery explosion that shook nearby homes, forced the evacuation of 100 people  and caused power failures that continued today.</p>
        <p>The woman who was killed, Hilde Hauswirth, 62, a nurse, was trapped inside her vehicle and died in the huge blaze, which kept firefighters at a distance, the police said. The driver of the gasoline delivery truck received minor injuries, the police said.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County police said today they were still investigating the crash, which occurred during a downpour that reduced visibility.</p>
        <p>The truck driver, Abdullah Ergin, 43, of Mastic Beach, was arraigned in First District Court in Central Islip today on charges that he had been driving with a suspended license, the police said. His license was suspended because he had failed to appear in court for violations, said Detective Lieutenant John Hoss of the Suffolk County police. He refused to say what the violations were.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ergin worked for Petroleum Asset Management Corporation in West Islip, the police said. Company representatives refused to comment today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ergin had finished delivering gasoline to the Delta Gas station on Montauk Highway and his truck was leaving the station about 10:45 p.m. when Ms. Hauswirth's vehicle crashed into it, officials said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hauswirth, of Islip, was driving to her job at the Good Samaritan Nursing Home in Sayville. She was traveling east on Montauk Highway as she struck the truck, which was blocking the highway as it turned west.</p>
        <p>''I heard, 'Kaboom,' '' said Don Ahlers, who lives a few blocks away and went out to see what had happened. ''It was pitch dark out and I could see the smoke from the flames,'' which he said shot 30 feet into the air.</p>
        <p>Fifteen fire departments were summoned, and officials on the scene decided to let the fire burn up the gasoline leaking from the tanker. As the flames soared past midnight,  several hundred firefighters built  banks of dirt around the truck to contain the runoff of gasoline, while 100 residents on surrounding blocks were evacuated to a local firehouse as a precaution.</p>
        <p>Today, power lines that caught fire in the blaze remained down, leaving about 20 customers without service.  About 4,000 lost power during the fire. A two-mile stretch of Montauk Highway, from Carleton Avenue to the Southern State Parkway, was closed to traffic.</p>
        <p>Workers from the Department of Environmental Conservation inspected the remaining gasoline. Mark Lowery, an agency spokesman, said that only trace amounts of gasoline and byproducts had been found in ponds, creeks, storm drains and sewers, though the truck was carrying 4,850 gallons of gasoline. He said the runoff posed no health risks for people or animals, and that a private company, Miller Environmental Group of Calverton, had begun a cleanup.</p>
        <p>The police said an autopsy would be performed on Ms. Hauswirth. An immigrant from Germany, she is survived by a husband and two sons.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hauswirth had worked at the Sayville nursing home as a certified nurse's aide for 11 years. She worked the night shift, but also volunteered at the home during the day.</p>
        <p>Mikhael Keifitz, an administrator at the home, said: ''She would go to the race track with residents. She would volunteer at resident parties and then go and work at night. People don't do this anymore. I'm not going to find anybody like her ever.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Keifitz, a Ukrainian immigrant, said they had become friends and often talked about their homelands.</p>
        <p>''I know she just went to Germany two weeks ago to see her mother, who was very elderly,'' he said. He recalled her saying, '' 'You know, I don't know if I'm going to see her again.' ''</p>
