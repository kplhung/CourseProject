        <p>LOBSTER, yes. Pork chops, no.</p>
        <p>Oysters, always. Bacon, never.</p>
        <p>As an assimilated Jew, this was the particular brand of culinary schizophrenia I grew up with. At home, my family was kosher with a vengeance. We had one set of dishes and silverware for meat, another for dairy, and never the twain did meet. I remember hearing that unkosher food was dirty, so pig remained reviled even when served in restaurants, while shellfish (equally unkosher), had somehow received a divine pardon. When the steamers hit the table at the Clam Box you would have thought it was gefilte fish.</p>
        <p>But for truly observant Jews, the 24/7 variety, kosher restaurants were traditionally the only alternative to staying home or going to Grandma's. The atmosphere in these restaurants echoed home -- large groups eating Old World classics like roast chicken and potted meatballs at meat meccas like Gluckstern's or Lou G. Siegel's. Or the same groups eating the cardiologist's special at the dairy Ratner's: cheese blintzes fried in butter, topped with sour cream.</p>
        <p>In recent years, though, those old-fashioned places have given way to more modern kosher options, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Mexican and French steakhouses among them. These days, within a half block of West 72nd Street alone you can find kosher pizza at Pizza Cave and kosher ribs (albeit beef) at Dougie's Bar-B-Que &amp; Grill -- the only barbecue place I've ever seen that serves chicken soup.</p>
        <p>But the newest additions to the kosher scene are high-end restaurants featuring ambitious dishes like bison, rack of lamb and whole roasted sea bass, with wine lists (hold the Manischewitz) in elegant surroundings. As more and more affluent young people are returning to the Orthodox tradition, they are demanding a new level of sophistication to match the mainstream, with their own cutting-edge choices. The latest entry in this category, Shallots, has opened in the Sony Building on the former site of the Quilted Giraffe, with prices to match its uptown digs: $47 for rack of lamb. The Four Seasons, by comparison, charges $45. So much for potted meatballs.</p>
        <p>''Upscale kosher has exploded in the last five years,'' said Sol Kirschenbaum, an owner of Levana, a contemporary Continental restaurant on the Upper West Side that opened in 1986. The Zagat Survey calls it ''the kosher Four Seasons,'' though it gives the food a rating of 21 versus the Four Seasons' 26, and the average meal at Levana is $44 instead of $67.</p>
        <p>''Originally, people weren't used to kosher fine dining establishments,'' Mr. Kirschenbaum said. ''Now they're no longer satisfied with 5 places to go, they want 25. The choices have become so broad.''</p>
        <p>''You're dealing with a whole new set of demographics now,'' said Menachem Lubinsky, publisher of Kosher Today, a trade publication, and the owner of Kosherfest, a kosher food trade show. ''Young Orthodox Jews are going upscale in every way, with cars, homes and now restaurants. The cross-fertilization between the Joe Liebermans of the world with Wall Street and the media means that they need places to entertain them. The young Orthodox want everything that the general population has, but they want it to be kosher. At a typical wedding now, you're more likely to have sushi than chopped liver.''</p>
        <p>That's too bad. I prefer chopped liver. Then again, being raised in the school of Lobster Dinner Judaism means I have plenty of choices when it comes to eating out. For those who don't, the brave new world of nouvelle kosher offers not only Shallots, an offshoot of a successful Chicago-based meat restaurant of the same name, but two other entries: Il Patrizio, an Upper East Side Italian dairy restaurant on the former site of Peaches, Marla Maples's place; and Prime Grill, a steakhouse in Midtown that was most recently Blackbird. Besides their culinary options, all three offer a lesson in New York restaurant real estate: it pays to know your audience. None of these locations made it with the mainstream (Shallots was most recently Drew Nieporent's Berkeley Bar and Grill) though they are in heavily trafficked areas.</p>
        <p>As Laura Frankel, the executive chef at Shallots, said, ''It's a mistake these days to open a restaurant without a customer group in mind.''</p>
        <p>Besides good food, that group wants ambience; the owners of Prime Grill are spending close to $2 million for renovations by the designer Matt Markowitz, who also did Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Mercer Kitchen. The opening is scheduled for the end of October. ''We will serve steak and sushi, and by the way, we're kosher,'' said  the manager, Chris Schienle. ''Instead of shrimp cocktail or a raw bar, our customers can substitute sushi for shellfish.''</p>
        <p>For those wondering what ''by the way, we're kosher'' means, kosher is not a cuisine. It is a strict adherence to dietary rules, which, broadly defined, include a complete separation of milk and meat, and a restriction to meat that comes from animals that have split hooves, chew their cud and are slaughtered in accordance with Jewish law; certain poultry, if it's killed correctly; and fish that has fins and scales, which is why shellfish is a no-go.</p>
        <p>The good news these days, though, is that kosher suppliers have broadened their inventory, benefiting from the general upgrading of American restaurants -- though if my grandmother were here to see Jews sitting down in fancy restaurants to eat buffalo, she would surely call it meshuga.</p>
        <p>The strides in dairy are a little less revolutionary. Il Patrizio opened in May with a menu offering fish, pasta and stone-oven pizza. Its chef, Cesar Moina, cooked at Mezzaluna and Torre di Pisa, and on a recent visit, he made me, my sister, Phoebe, and my aunt Evelyn very happy. Our favorite appetizer was a combination of artichoke, potato, spinach and Parmesan, which was the kind of thing you could eat a potful of on a cold night without even realizing it.</p>
        <p>All three of us had fish, and it was nothing like the old days, sitting on the plate in its own liquid, tasting like punishment. The salmon with a mustard crust was crispy on the outside, tender within; the whole roasted sea bass was moist and flavorful, and the red snapper with olives, tomatoes and capers was downright festive.</p>
        <p>Il Patrizio's surroundings are simple and elegant, with exposed brick walls and full-blown roses in glass bowls on white tablecloths. The clientele was decidedly stylish, with one young couple sporting shopping bags from Barneys and Stephane Kelian, and a young guy (cute) eating alone at the bar. If the men weren't wearing skullcaps, you'd have no idea the place was kosher, which, in the lexicon of separate but equal, is the ultimate compliment.</p>
        <p>I brought my parents to Levana, where James Lenzi, the chef, formerly of Tavern on the Green and Cafe des Artistes, stretches the borders past brisket to venison, quail and bison. I especially liked the pepper-crusted venison, which tasted like gourmet pastrami. Mr. Lenzi also turns out beef fillets, veal chops and sweetbreads, though the Israeli wine we ordered, Galil Merlot, Carmel Private Collection, did none of them justice. The restaurant is modern in design, a bit spare for my taste, but jammed with everyone from young couples to large families, not to mention a table of 10 women, 1 man and a blinding video camera. Most seemed like satisfied regulars.</p>
        <p>Far more formal is the two-month-old Shallots. There is only one word to describe this restaurant, and that is chutzpah with a capital C. Its style is corporate ornate, and perhaps a little too-too for some of its customers. The man at the table next to ours was shooed outside by his wife all three times his cell phone rang. By the time dessert came, he looked as if he wished he were back at Ratner's.</p>
        <p>Shallots drives the point home that you need more than kosher food to make a kosher restaurant succeed; if you're going to play in the big leagues, you need a top-of-the-line dining room staff. While the service at Il Patrizio was unfailingly courteous, as it was at Levana (if less polished), at Shallots it was case-study bad. From the moment Phoebe and I walked in, we fought the urge to leave. Granted, the sight of two women alone makes most restaurateurs as happy as an unannounced visit by the health inspector, but this was a new low. We were first led to a table next to the restrooms, a service area and a table set for 18. When we balked, we were relocated to the rear banquette; the free-standing tables were reserved, we were told. Apparently, our reservation didn't count.</p>
        <p>The chef, Ms. Frankel, is from Shallots Chicago and trained at the Cooking Hospitality Institute of Chicago. Her $47 stuffed rack of lamb seemed to indicate the scope of her ambitions, so Phoebe ordered it and I ordered the grilled rib-eye, my favorite steak. But here was an example of the new kosher gone wrong. While the lamb was tasteless (forget the apricots, where's the salt?), the rib-eye was downright unrecognizable. I called over a waiter, who summoned a manager. ''What is this?'' I asked, genuinely confused. ''It's rib-eye,'' he explained. ''The chef orders it without the bone and takes off the lip, which is the meat surrounding the eye. That's the part with the fat in it, which is why there's no flavor. Do you want something else?'' No. I wanted my steak with all the fat in it so it tasted like steak -- the kind, actually, we used to eat at Grossinger's.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, most of the other customers seemed suitably impressed, though some remained skeptical. A man at one table -- where a laptop was up and running for most of the meal -- surveyed the menu and asked loudly, ''What the hell is French melon sorbet?,'' referring to an ingredient in the heirloom tomato salad.</p>
        <p>After two forgettable desserts, we got the check, which came to $100 a person, about $20 more than it had been at Levana, $40 more than at Il Patrizio, which, granted, had no meat. At Shallots, I added a 15 percent tip without realizing that an 18 percent gratuity had been added for me. I read it only after I'd left, in the fine print at the bottom of the menu. Do I need to tell you that no one pointed out my error?</p>
        <p>These glitches aside, however, kosher fine dining has clearly made strides, and judging by the full dining rooms, it is definitely satisfying its audience. But as much as I miss the onion rolls at the old Ratner's, there is one thing I'm still certain of: when it's time to eat out, I'll have the lobster.</p>
        <p>PAN SAUTE OF ARTICHOKES, POTATOES, SPINACH AND PARMESAN  Adapted from Il Patrizio  Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 medium Idaho potato, peeled and cut into  1/4-inch cubes  12 baby artichokes, tough outer leaves removed, ends trimmed  7 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced  1 large sprig fresh rosemary, minced  6 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  1 1/2 pounds spinach, washed and trimmed  2 ripe tomatoes, seeded and cubed.</p>
        <p>1. In a pot of rapidly boiling water, cook potatoes until tender, about 5 minutes. Drain, and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Thinly slice artichokes lengthwise. In a skillet over medium-low heat, warm 6 tablespoons oil and gently saute artichokes, half the garlic and the rosemary until artichokes are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Add  cooked potatoes and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons Parmesan, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, in a skillet over medium heat, warm remaining tablespoon oil and saute spinach with remaining garlic until wilted, about 3 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons cheese, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Spoon spinach into bottom of a 1-quart gratin dish. Divide artichoke mixture among 4 6-ounce ramekins, packing it down very hard. Let artichoke mixture cool in  molds.</p>
        <p>5. Just before serving, heat oven to 500 degrees. Run a small knife around sides of  artichoke mixture in ramekins, then unmold them on top of spinach. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons Parmesan, and bake for 5 minutes, until cheese browns. Garnish with tomatoes, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>SYRIAN SPICED RACK OF LAMB  Adapted from Prime Grill  Time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons cumin seeds  1 tablespoon black peppercorns  1 teaspoon allspice berries  1 teaspoon coriander seeds  1 teaspoon cardamom seeds, removed from the pod  1 cinnamon stick  1 tablespoon paprika  Salt to taste  2 racks of lamb (4 chops each, 1 1/2 pounds total)  2 tablespoons canola oil.</p>
        <p>1. In a large skillet over medium heat, toast  cumin, peppercorns, allspice, coriander, cardamom and cinnamon stick until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Grind spices along with paprika and a pinch of salt in a spice grinder or coffee grinder.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Salt lamb, then pat spice mixture all over it. Let rest for 15 minutes at room temperature.</p>
        <p>3. Heat oil in a large skillet. Brown lamb on all sides. Transfer to a rack set in a roasting pan, and roast lamb until done to taste, about 25 minutes for medium rare (130 degrees on a meat thermometer). Carve lamb into chops and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
