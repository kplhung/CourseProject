        <p>Broadcom fired a return salvo at Intel yesterday, filing suit to block Intel, the world's largest chip maker, from selling products that Broadcom says are linked to theft of its trade secrets. Intel filed suit last month, charging Broadcom with infringing its patents on cable and high-speed networking products. In a related suit filed in March, Intel asserted that Broadcom had misappropriated trade secrets. Broadcom's suit says that Intel pressed a customer into supplying it with Broadcom high-speed networking chips that it used to develop a competing product based on Broadcom's design. The suit follows a counterclaim Broadcom filed last week in response to Intel's suit. ''We don't believe it has merit,'' said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel spokesman, referring to Broadcom's request for a preliminary injunction. ''Nor do we believe their counterclaim filed last week has merit, and we will be happy to present our case in court.''</p>
