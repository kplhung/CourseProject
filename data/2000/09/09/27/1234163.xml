        <p>For decades, political scientists have considered the economy the single best predictor of the electorate's mood. Good times favor incumbents, bad times insurgents. And so for Gov. George W. Bush, one challenge has loomed high above the others in his quest for the White House: how to defeat a sitting vice president during these roaring good times.</p>
        <p>For a while, it seemed as if Mr. Bush might defy history, as he stayed ahead of Vice President Al Gore in polls even as the economy hummed along. But his lead in those polls has vanished. And the issue that once seemed to play so well for him, character, has diminished in importance, the polls show.</p>
        <p>It is largely for that reason, many political analysts say, that the Texas governor has adopted a new slogan this week: ''education recession.'' Ostensibly, it refers to what he calls a ''crisis'' in the nation's public schools. But at its heart, the slogan is also meant to raise alarms about the health of the nation's economy in the not-too-distant future.</p>
        <p>And in raising those red flags, the analysts say, Mr. Bush has turned his signature issue, education, into a weapon for slashing at the central arguments for electing Mr. Gore: peace and prosperity.</p>
        <p>''Gore's advantage on the economy is critical for Bush to try to overcome,'' said Evans Witt, president of the Princeton Survey Research, a polling firm. ''If you say we're in a recession long enough, it certainly has an economic connotation, even if you are using it to discuss education.''</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, acknowledged as much, saying, ''The point of this is that while the economy is strong, there are problems in society.''</p>
        <p>During a tour of the West Coast this week, Mr. Bush said he saw warning signs in America. Then he ticked them off: Gasoline prices spiraling out of control. Farmers struggling to survive. The nation in danger of losing its technological edge. And illiterate youths on the cusp of criminality.</p>
        <p>''In some places, there is a recession in America,'' Mr. Bush said today at a high school in Northern California. ''In some school districts there is a recession, and this country needs to do something about it early, before it's too late.''</p>
        <p>He went on to say, ''If American students don't lead the world in math and science, the next generation of Americans may not lead the world.''</p>
        <p>Raising concerns about the economy represents something of a tactical shift for Mr. Bush, who has spent much of the campaign attacking Mr. Gore's character and credibility. But several recent polls indicate that voters now see little difference between the candidates in terms of their morality and honesty.</p>
        <p>''It's much harder for Bush because he can't hammer at character anymore,'' said Mr. Witt.</p>
        <p>But some analysts said Mr. Bush would have trouble tapping into voters' anxieties about the economy, because there is so little there to tap. According to a Fox News poll taken last week, 60 percent of voters said they thought the country was headed in the right direction, one of the highest readings since January 1998.</p>
        <p>And a Gallup Poll conducted in June showed that only 22 percent of Americans said that the most important issues in the race were economic, as compared with 69 percent who felt that way in the fall of 1992.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it makes much sense,'' said James Campbell, a professor of political science at the State University of New York at Buffalo who has studied the effects of the economy on presidential elections. ''There are no obvious clouds on the horizon.''</p>
        <p>Still, Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, said he could see the logic to Mr. Bush's strategy because voters care deeply about economic issues even in good times.</p>
        <p>''It's not top of mind this year,'' Mr. Newport said. ''But when we mention the economy, people say: 'Oh yes, that will be very important. How the candidates handle the economy is important.''</p>
        <p>Some analysts also said that raising concerns about the economy could strike a chord with working-class voters, typically families who earn less than $40,000 a year and live from pay check to pay check. Polls show those people tend to be swing voters whose allegiances could easily change if they felt the economy were turning sour.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Bush said their internal polls had shown that the slogan ''education recession'' had played well among independent voters and women.</p>
        <p>Mr. Witt noted that many such swing voters live in the industrial Midwest, where the presidential race is most closely contested, including Missouri, Michigan and Ohio, as well as in Pennsylvania. And they are a group that might find Mr. Bush's plan for across-the-board income tax cuts appealing, he asserted.</p>
        <p>''Bush has hit pretty heavily on the idea that Gore's tax cut may leave people out,'' Mr. Witt said. ''That's a point that I think might resonate with some people in this group.'' Because they are on the edge.''</p>
        <p>Several analysts also said they thought it was clever of Mr. Bush to tie two major issues together in a way that could undermine Mr. Gore's support. ''It has a subliminal quality to it,'' said Stephen Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington.</p>
        <p>In His Own Words</p>
        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH  Remarks last night on ''Larry King Live'' on CNN:</p>
        <p>''I'm going to win California. I am. . . . I was up in Silicon Valley. I've got a huge base of support in Silicon Valley for a lot of reasons. One, I support H-1B visas, free trade, tort reform. I've got a good chance amongst the Hispanic voters here in California.</p>
        <p>My reputation as an inclusive governor preceded me here in this campaign. People, you know, the Republicans have been associated, rightly or wrongly, with being anti-immigrant in the state of California. We've turned that around. I've got a great record when it comes to public schools and education is a very important issue in the state of California.</p>
        <p>My job is going to be to find those Republicans that were strong Republicans up until 1992 that Perot peeled off from us and get them back in the party. And I think I can do so by being a positive, optimistic, forward-looking candidate.''</p>
