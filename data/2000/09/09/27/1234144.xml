        <p>The lights of Ebbets Field, which gazed down on a golden past of Robinsons and Reeses and Walkers and Furillos, found a home in Downing Stadium when the wrecking ball tore into the home of the Dodgers and stilled the heart of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Now dem lights -- or whatever may be left of them -- are about to go homeless again.</p>
        <p>Downing Stadium faces demolition this fall as part of a $200 million renovation of Randalls Island, its home near the Triborough Bridge and at the conjuncture of Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The Randalls Island Sports Foundation, a public-private partnership with the Parks Department that is developing the park, plans to hand over the stadium, emptied of anything of value, to the demolition contractor on Nov. 1.</p>
        <p>''Everything is worth saving, if it means something to someone,'' said the parks commissioner, Henry J. Stern. ''If these are the lights from Ebbets Field, they have to be preserved. You'd have to be a philistine to destroy them.''</p>
        <p>Brooklynites still call Walter O'Malley far worse than a philistine for moving their beloved Bums to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. Indeed, the lights are a reminder of the power of one of America's great nostalgia machines: baseball. The Dodgers are still such a powerful presence in Brooklyn that the design for the proposed Mets stadium consciously evokes Ebbets Field, and a Dodger flag flies over Brooklyn Borough Hall.</p>
        <p>But the lights are not the only holy relic from New York's baseball past.</p>
        <p>Another stadium, the Polo Grounds of the New York Giants, was done in four years after the same wrecking ball demolished Ebbets Field in 1960. (The ball was painted white, like a baseball, in a whimsy of the time that now seems cruelly mocking.)</p>
        <p>At the former stadium sites, the only remnants are plaques and the names, which are attached to housing projects. But in spots around the city, in museums and in private homes, bits and pieces of New York stadium history abound.</p>
        <p>Over on Utica Avenue in East Flatbush, in front of the Canarsie Casket Company, stands the center field flagpole from Ebbets Field. It was erected there by Marvin Kratter, a developer who owned the stadium in its final years and who built the housing project, according to a plaque.</p>
        <p>The pole is a source of pride for Samuel M. Romano, an owner of the coffin company, who worked as a maintenance man at Ebbets Field and still loves his old team. ''We're Mets fans, but really Dodgers fans,'' he said. That's the Brooklyn Dodgers, please understand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kratter also donated about 2,200 Ebbets seats to a ball field for inmates at the old workhouse on Hart Island. After years exposed to the elements, they fell into disrepair.</p>
        <p>Some were salvaged and presented by the Brooklyn Dodger Hall of Fame to former Dodger players. A few iron frames were passed on to the office of the New York City correction commissioner, said Thomas C. McCarthy, a correction spokesman. One was given as a gift to honor the long service of a correction officer who worked on the island.</p>
        <p>Old Ebbets Field seats, in fact, are everywhere.</p>
        <p>Donald N. Thompson, a Dodger outfielder in 1951-54 now living in Asheville, N.C., has several. A client of his real estate business gave them to him several years ago.</p>
        <p>''I still got them,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''They work perfectly, No. 23 and 24. They fold up in back, in that old Dodger blue.''</p>
        <p>The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., has one, plus two benches from a grandstand, the cornerstone and home plate. Four seats reside at the Brooklyn Historical Society, along with another home plate, a base, a section sign, a brick and the 1955 World Series pennant.</p>
        <p>William L. Gladstone, a collector and the owner of the Class A minor-league team in Pittsfield, Mass., owns a bronze plaque that hung in the Ebbets Field rotunda and lists the team's ownership.</p>
        <p>The Polo Grounds has a lower profile in the nostalgia gallery, but its ghosts also linger.</p>
        <p>Up in Manhattan and a mile or so north of Downing Stadium stands a decrepit concrete staircase. Clothes litter the steps. Most of its railing is gone. A chain link fence blocks the top entrance, at Edgecombe Avenue and 158th Street. But large bronze letters on the middle landing declare: ''The John T. Brush Stairway presented by the New York Giants.''</p>
        <p>Named after a Giants owner, the stairway descends part of Coogan's Bluff, down to a road that runs into Harlem River Drive and just a few hundred feet from where the Polo Grounds stood.</p>
        <p>Robert Mandt, director of operations at Shea Stadium, says he has a little piece of the roof from a Polo Grounds dugout, courtesy of a former Shea employee whose father, a rabid fan of the Giants, salvaged it during the demolition, just as many fans scooped up earth and bits of rubble.</p>
        <p>The Hall of Fame in Cooperstown holds other remnants of the Polo Grounds: the seat used by the wife of John McGraw, the Giants legendary manager; a concession stand; a souvenir board; a megaphone used for announcements before a public address system was in place; a turnstile; several seats; iron figures from an aisle shaped with the letters NYG; and a gong used to signal the start of batting practice.</p>
        <p>Less well-known stadiums have left remains. Near the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, a brick wall on Third Avenue between First and Third streets forms part of a Consolidated Edison warehouse. Con Ed and baseball historians say the wall came from Washington Park, home of the Brooklyn Dodgers for 14 years before the team moved to Ebbets Field in 1913.</p>
        <p>Casey Stengel played his first game at Washington Park, and Cy Young his last.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the story of a relic is even better than the real thing.</p>
        <p>The Ebbets Field clock was long believed to have rested atop the minor-league park in Asheville, N.C., home of the Asheville Tourists. Not so, said the team's assistant general manager, Chris J. Smith.</p>
        <p>''It was a scam,'' he said. ''Someone drove through the state with a van full of Ebbets Field clocks, selling them to minor-league stadiums.''</p>
        <p>Must have been a New Yorker, he said.</p>
        <p>The market for stadium memorabilia truly began with the restoration of Yankee Stadium in the early 1970's, said Bert Sugar, the boxing writer and baseball author and a collector.</p>
        <p>Collectors swept away old seats, metal plaques from box-seat railings, bricks, even Stadium Club matchbooks, Mr. Sugar said. A Japanese department store bought the flagpoles that bore pennants, uniforms, even grounds-crew overalls.</p>
        <p>When the Boston Red Sox refurbished the famous wall in left field in 1975-76, the team sold chunks for charity, Mr. Sugar points out. The Chicago White Sox did the same with bricks and chairs from the old Comiskey Park.</p>
        <p>Downing Stadium is unlikely to attract the same sort of veneration, though it has its own rich memories. There, Jesse Owens qualified for the 1936 Olympics, Pele played his first game for the New York Cosmos and the Black Yankees of the old Negro National League played a season, in 1938. Duke Ellington and Jimi Hendrix performed at Downing.</p>
        <p>Now, cracks ripple through the foundation, and reinforcing metal rods are laid bare and rusty from crumbling concrete. There are no concession stands, hot water in the locker room showers or even seats at the stadium, which has a capacity of 21,000.</p>
        <p>Parks officials promise to preserve what is worth saving, including stylish bathroom tiles, old wooden refrigerators and exterior murals painted by the students at New Dorp High School of Staten Island, which said it was willing to take them back.</p>
        <p>Yet somehow, history seems to still shimmer in the air above. The lights of Ebbets Field, after all, shone on the first black man to play major-league baseball in the 20th century. They lighted up one of the game's great moments: the second consecutive no-hitter by Johnny Vander Meer of the Cincinnati Reds, on June 15, 1938. It was the first night game at Ebbets Field.</p>
        <p>''Maybe right then and there, those lights became magic,'' said Michael Benson, a baseball historian and the author of ''Ballparks of North America.''</p>
        <p>At first, the Downing lights were offered for the new minor-league stadium being built in Coney Island, which would have been an all-too-perfect fate, but city officials said they were too expensive to adapt. Officials of the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown said they would come down to take a look.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern had a few spur-of-the-moment ideas: hang them at park headquarters or a historic house, or maybe a museum wants them.</p>
        <p>But after a closer look, it turns out there is not much Brooklyn left in the lights.</p>
        <p>Parks Department records show that after the destruction of Ebbets Field, the lights were sent to Downing Stadium and plans were drawn up in 1962 to have them installed on new poles and frames. Over the years, many of the individual lamp fixtures were replaced.</p>
        <p>It is not clear how many of the originals are left above the stadium or in storage space filled with fixtures, which seem mostly newer but with a sprinkling of heavy cast-iron and glass models that parks electricians say are originals.</p>
        <p>No one at Downing Stadium or the Parks Department seems to know what happened to the rest of the original lights.</p>
        <p>That does not matter much to one former Dodger, Ralph Branca, who perhaps more than anyone else unites the Polo Grounds and Ebbets Field. Mr. Branca threw the pitch that Bobby Thomson hit over the fence at the Polo Grounds and became the ''shot heard 'round the world'' to give the Giants the 1951 pennant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Branca said the Ebbets lights prompted ''no feelings, to tell the truth,'' and he could think of little use for them now -- ''unless you got some collector who's got a big backyard who wants to light it up.''</p>
