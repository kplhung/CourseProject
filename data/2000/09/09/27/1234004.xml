        <p>HERE is how you can tell the Half King is a bar for writers: First, it has no television. Second, the owners say it is.</p>
        <p>The owners should know a ''literary bar,'' as they call it. They include, most famously, Sebastian Junger, the author of ''The Perfect Storm''; Scott Anderson, a journalist; Nanette Burstein, a documentary filmmaker; and Jerome O'Connor, a sometime film producer who used to own St. Dymphna's, an Irish bar in the East Village.</p>
        <p>But the Half King, named for an 18th-century American Indian leader, is unlike any conventional notion of a writers' bar. The music is so loud that conversation is hard and brooding impossible. The patrons are so young they probably wouldn't know a typewriter from a martini, and the bartenders are so friendly they would probably even serve editors.</p>
        <p>One more thing sets the Half King apart from any writers' bar I've ever known: food that you can actually enjoy.</p>
        <p>For that, credit must go to Conor Foran, the chef, whose kitchen is in service from morning until late at night. Mr. Foran's starting point is Irish pub grub, but he skillfully manages to elevate it from its proletarian moorings while retaining its heartiness and simplicity. The creamy seafood chowder ($5), rich and chock full of fish and shrimp, is something you might find at the Crow's Nest, the bar in Gloucester, Mass., that was a second home to many of the fishermen in Mr. Junger's book. But you would hardly expect to find a light cake constructed of potatoes and goat cheese, wrapped in excellent smoked salmon ($9) and accompanied by a good green salad.</p>
        <p>Nor would you expect an artfully composed salad of artichokes, sweet beets and creamy goat cheese ($8), or crisp fried calamari with cucumber carved into slender strands ($7). A silky smoked salmon salad with horseradish sauce ($10) is a huge portion, enough for two. The sweet, gingery seaweed salad ($7) seems like another tasty nod toward Mr. Junger's watery tale.</p>
        <p>Main courses include a superbly flavorful pork roast ($14), the meat sliced thin and fanned around a parsnip puree, and a surprisingly delicate fillet of sole ($16), cooked just enough to release its reticent flavor. Lamb steak ($16) is full of forthright flavor, better than the mushy sirloin ($16) or the timid salmon ($16), and the shepherd's pie ($11), made with chopped beef, is ample and excellent.</p>
        <p>Somehow, waitresses manage to navigate without a slip the chaos of a night's smoke and noise, maintaining good humor even while maneuvering through the jostling crowd.</p>
        <p>Dinner at the Half King is only part of the story. By day, the bar is almost empty, and it's easier to notice the handsome simplicity of the woody decor, with its occasional nautical artifacts. A small garden in the rear, which provides a respite from the nightly hubbub, is just as pleasant at lunch, or at breakfast, when you can sample the delicious house-made scones ($3), served warm with clotted cream and jam, or the huge Irish breakfast ($11), with Irish bacon, eggs, tomatoes, beans and those mealy sausages known in Ireland and Britain as puddings.</p>
        <p>At lunch one day, as I was enjoying a juicy burger with crisp, salty fries ($9), I overheard a group of four people at the next booth discussing the harbor in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A writer could actually make an afternoon of the place, sitting undisturbed with paper or a laptop and a cup of coffee, or a pint of Guinness.</p>
        <p>The Half King has an inexpensive, serviceable wine list and a selection of beers on tap, although the bartenders seemed overly challenged by a gimlet. It also has some good, rustic desserts ($6 each), like a rough-hewn berry, peach and apple crumble, and a rugged lemon tart that was thankfully more tart than sweet.</p>
        <p>If a literary hangout is by nature exclusive, with a cast of maladjusted drinkers, the Half King has a long way to go. Perhaps it could do something to keep out the celebrity seekers and those interested in a good meal, like requiring a password to get in. How about ''swordfish?''</p>
