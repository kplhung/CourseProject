        <p>The police say a helmet would probably not have saved a 6-year-old boy who was fatally struck by a car last Thursday afternoon while crossing the street on a foot-powered scooter in Elizabeth, N.J. But helmets may soon be required for young scooter riders in the state.</p>
        <p>The death of the boy, Andy Alexis Pino, has renewed calls for the state and several local governments to pass helmet laws for users of the newly popular scooters.</p>
        <p>The accident, first reported in yesterday's Star-Ledger of Newark, is believed to be the first scooter-related death in New Jersey, and the second in the nation.</p>
        <p>Andy Pino died at University Hospital in Newark at noon on Friday, as a result of being struck after he scooted out from a row of cars and sport utility vehicles waiting at a traffic light in front of his home, said Lt. Edward Baginski of the Elizabeth Police Department. He was struck by a car moving in the opposite direction, driven by an Elizabeth woman who never saw him and had no chance to stop, Lieutenant Baginski said.</p>
        <p>The boy suffered severe head trauma, but the lieutenant said, ''Unfortunately, in this case, a helmet wouldn't have saved his life.'' Nor did his use of a scooter necessarily contribute to the accident, said Lt. Baginski. On Sept. 17, the lieutenant said, a 5-year-old girl, Angelina Amaro, died when she was run over by a slow-moving truck as she ran from between two parked cars toward an ice cream truck across the street.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, officials are pointing to the Thursday accident as a reminder of the need to regulate use of the scooters.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth and Jefferson Townships in Morris County are among the municipalities considering ordinances that would require children under a certain age to wear helmets while using the scooters, just as state law requires helmets for children 14 and under on bicycles and in-line skates.</p>
        <p>Assemblyman Gary Guear, a Democrat from Mercer County, said yesterday that within 30 days he would introduce an amendment to make the helmet law include scooters.</p>
        <p>In 1991, legislators made the wearing of helmets while bicycling mandatory for children 14 and under. The law was amended in 1997 to include skateboards and in-line skates. Mr. Guear said penalties under the scooter amendment would be $25 for a first offense (with a rebate upon proof of a helmet purchase) and $100 for subsequent offenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guear said he was motivated  in part by a recent report by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission. The commission, which has tracked scooter-related injuries since 1973, decided to publicize the figures this month after they skyrocketed over the summer,  said Ann Brown, the commission chairwoman.</p>
        <p>In August, there were 5,900 emergency-room cases involving scooters, Ms. Brown said, up from 457 in May. For the first six months of 2000, there were 11,300, she said, adding that scooter injuries were becoming almost as common as injuries for in-line skates. In-line skates were involved in 95,129 injuries in 1999, Ms. Brown said.</p>
        <p>The commission has not recommended requiring helmets and elbow and knee pads. But Ms. Brown did recommend that parents give their children scooters only on the condition that they wear such protection. ''It's going to be everyone's hot Christmas gift,'' she said.</p>
