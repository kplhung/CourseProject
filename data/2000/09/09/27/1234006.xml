        <p>JUST a few years ago, Dan Gross would have said he had this work-life thing all figured out. Simply put, his work was his life.</p>
        <p>Back in the winter of 1997 he was the youngest partner at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, where he earned a lot of money to persuade the rest of us to buy things like Kodak film and Lipton teas. He had just turned 30 and remembers growing misty-eyed because his life was so good as he celebrated at a dinner with his family.</p>
        <p>The next afternoon, Mr. Gross's younger brother, Matthew, was shot in the head -- a victim of a shooting spree on the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire State Building. (Matthew Gross survived, but has never really recovered.)</p>
        <p>Dan Gross learned of the shooting when the Knicks' game he was watching (while analyzing the commercials) was interrupted by a news report. Almost immediately, he says, ''selling tea and film and mouthwash didn't seem important anymore.''</p>
        <p>He'd heard of people who anesthetize themselves with work, burying themselves in the office, grateful for the diversion. He tried that, but although he showed up at his job, only his outer shell was there.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, our work shapes our lives, leaving us to fit life in around the edges, in the spare time that work allows. But sometimes, life steps in and takes charge of our work. In a single, shattering moment, the path you planned to travel to retirement becomes one you can't bear to set foot upon again.</p>
        <p>Karen Borkowsky's moment came in December 1998, back when she was a buyer in the shoe department of Macy's, a job that brought her happiness in the form of limitless pairs of shoes.</p>
        <p>It was consuming work, and she used to joke that the store's slogan ''We're a Part of Your Life'' should be changed to ''We're Your Entire Life,'' because of the time she gave to the store.</p>
        <p>When her breast cancer was diagnosed when she was 32, Ms. Borkowsky wanted to cling to work. She was back at Macy's shortly after the second of her two mastectomies, and she came in every day during her chemotherapy. Halfway through her treatment she was promoted to director of women's shoes, a job she used to think she wanted.</p>
        <p>But after four months of slogging in every day she had a revelation: while her fear had been that she would not be able to work, her problem was that she didn't want to work. ''My heart wasn't in it,'' she says. ''Going in and worrying whether my shoes were on the selling floor just didn't do it for me.''</p>
        <p>What did do it for her was walking. She had been an avid runner before her cancer (in fact, the disease was diagnosed soon after she ran the New York City Marathon) and during the worst of her chemotherapy she began training for a three-day, 60-mile Avon-sponsored fund-raising walk against breast cancer, so that she would have a goal.</p>
        <p>Every morning, ''even when I felt sick,'' she would walk 8 to 10 miles and think about what she should do with her life. By the end of the summer, she had raised $41,000 in pledges, walked the walk, and quit her job. Soon after that she joined the staff of the American Cancer Society as the organizer of Making Strides Against Breast Cancer, a five-mile fund-raising walk to be held in Central Park on Oct. 15.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gross, in turn, left his partnership at J. Walter Thompson and went into a different kind of advertising. He is the founder of Pax, a nonprofit group that creates media campaigns against gun violence. You will probably see his latest wave of billboards and TV spots shortly, informing parents that 40 percent of households have guns and urging them to ask if there is a gun in the house before sending their children to play at a friend's. (Just as an aside: he has certainly convinced me.)</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Gross and Ms. Borkowsky ask that their lives not be turned into ''happily ever afters'' -- workaholic-sees-the-light-and-takes-a-pay-cut-but-has-never-felt-more-fulfilled.</p>
        <p>Yes, they say, they do relish going to work in the morning with a sense of purpose. But work that is an expression of a life carries its own burdens.</p>
        <p>''A side effect of this,'' Mr. Gross said, ''is that I remind myself, on a daily basis, about the worst thing that ever happened in my life. That can wear at you.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Borkowsky agrees. ''The difference between buying shoes and changing the world,'' she said, ''is that people used to call me up to ask me about fall styles. Now people call me up to tell me that someone they know has been diagnosed with breast cancer.''</p>
