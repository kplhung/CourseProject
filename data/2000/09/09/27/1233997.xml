        <p>SINGLE malt? One assumes a Scotch whiskey with a tongue-twisting name, or a similar spirit from Ireland. But now, for the first time, there is an American single malt.</p>
        <p>The newcomer is St. George Single Malt, made in Alameda, Calif., by St. George Spirits, a company known for its eaux de vie. This single malt is not your smoky, honeyed, amber Highlands dram, but a lighter quaff, closer perhaps to Irish and with a personality all its own. In the glass it's the color of oaky chardonnay, not only because it's young, but because, unlike most whiskeys and brandies, it is not tinted with caramel.</p>

        <p>SINGLE malt? One assumes a Scotch whiskey with a tongue-twisting name, or a similar spirit from Ireland. But now, for the first time, there is an American single malt.</p>
        <p>The newcomer is St. George Single Malt, made in Alameda, Calif., by St. George Spirits, a company known for its eaux de vie. This single malt is not your smoky, honeyed, amber Highlands dram, but a lighter quaff, closer perhaps to Irish and with a personality all its own. In the glass it's the color of oaky chardonnay, not only because it's young, but because, unlike most whiskeys and brandies, it is not tinted with caramel.</p>
        <p>The first whiff suggests dried apricots. It has the exuberance of a young spirit not quite reined in by its three years in oak, which is the minimum allowed in Scotland; most Scotch is aged longer. (The ''single'' means whiskey from one distillery.)</p>
        <p>Complex floral undertones and flavors of nut brittle and cocoa emerge on the palate. Despite its relatively high alcohol level (86 proof), this whiskey has a lightness that makes it more suitable, to my taste, for sipping before dinner than after. A cheese like Parmesan or Gruyere would be a fine complement. The finish has the clean elegance of a good sauvignon blanc.</p>
        <p>This is a departure from the American whiskey tradition, which started in the late 18th century in Appalachia and the Ohio Valley, where corn was distilled into bourbon and sour mash. In single malts, the only grain is barley, and until now, malted barley was used here only in good-quality beer. Jorg Rupf, an Alsatian who founded St. George Spirits 18 years ago, has the barley he uses fermented by a microbrewer.</p>
        <p>Only 500 cases of his single malt whiskey have been released for sale. Half of every year's production is being aged longer. For single-malt fans, waiting is half the fun.</p>
        <p>FLORENCE FABRICANT</p>
        <p>St. George Single Malt is about $50 for 750 milliliters at Acker Merrall &amp; Condit, 160 West 72nd Street, and Beekman Liquors, 500 Lexington Avenue (47th Street).</p>
