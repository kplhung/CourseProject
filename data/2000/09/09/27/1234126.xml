        <p>As executives of movie studios prepared for sharp questioning at a Senate hearing on Wednesday, the industry announced new steps today to limit the marketing of adult-rated movies to children.</p>
        <p>Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said at a news conference that each of the major movie-making companies had set a ''goal of not inappropriately specifically targeting children in its advertising of films rated R for violence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti said the studios had agreed not to include children younger than 17 in focus groups testing movies rated R for violence unless the children were accompanied by a parent or guardian. And he said previews for such movies would no longer be shown before G-rated films.</p>
        <p>The new steps are voluntary and include no enforcement mechanism. Mr. Valenti said that each year his association would review how the member companies were complying.</p>
        <p>Under the code established by the industry, children younger than 17 are not supposed to be allowed in R-rated movies unless they enter with an adult. Movies rated G are supposed to be suitable for children. There are two ratings in between, PG (warning parents that some material may not be suitable for children) and PG-13 (warning that some material may be inappropriate for children younger than 13).</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti said the industry was responding to the uproar created by a Federal Trade Commission report, released on Sept. 11, that said the vast majority of adult-rated movies, recordings and electronic games were marketed to children.</p>
        <p>Two days later, executives of companies that make and sell recordings and video games testified before the Senate commerce committee and were criticized by senators from both parties. To the consternation of the senators, film executives had refused to appear on such short notice. The panel's chairman, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, called a new hearing for Wednesday and summoned the film executives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti said executives from the eight largest studios would testify. They are the Walt Disney Company, DreamWorks SKG, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures Entertainment, the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Universal Studios and Warner Brothers.</p>
        <p>He suggested that some executives would announce efforts to limit marketing that went further than those on which the entire industry could agree.</p>
        <p>Studies of the link between violence in entertainment and violent conduct are inconclusive. But polls show that more than 80 percent of adults believe there is a connection, a popular view not lost on politicians.</p>
        <p>The commission report had led the industry ''to take a fresh new look at the way we market films,'' Mr. Valenti said.</p>
        <p>But he rejected the suggestion that the movie companies should simply stop all marketing of R-rated movies to children. Some movies with an R rating because of violent scenes like ''Saving Private Ryan'' are not only acceptable but worthwhile for some children, Mr. Valenti said. He suggested that it was reasonable for the studios to try to get children to persuade their parents to take them.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, studios should be allowed to advertise during popular programs or events like the Super Bowl, even though many children would be watching.</p>
        <p>''How on earth,'' he asked, ''can you advertise anything that some kids won't be watching?''</p>
