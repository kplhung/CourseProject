        <p>Simple Exchange, Complex Memories</p>
        <p>It was, GORE VIDAL said yesterday, a short and simple exchange in a restaurant. But it stirred 40-year-old memories that were decidedly complicated.</p>
        <p>It was an encounter with ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. on Monday night at Elaine's, the restaurant on Second Avenue near 88th Street -- the first time they had met.</p>
        <p>''He came over, walked up to me and said, 'Hello, I'm Bobby Kennedy,' '' Mr. Vidal said. ''I said, 'How nice to see you.' That was the end of it.'' (A moment later, Mr. Vidal added, ''I think I may have asked him to come to the play.'' That would be ''Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man,' '' the revival of a 1960 morality play at the Virginia Theater.)</p>
        <p>Then, the memories.</p>
        <p>''I said to the table at large, 'How eerie to be looking into those eyes again,' '' Mr. Vidal said. ''I feel as if it were a ghost. He's so like his father.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal met Mr. Kennedy's father in 1960, when Mr. Vidal ran for the House from the mid-Hudson region of  New York. ''We did not get on from the time he was in charge of the overall Kennedy campaign for the State of New York,'' Mr. Vidal said yesterday. ''He came up and said, 'Why don't you mention the ticket?' and was very angry about my doing so well and never mentioning Jack Kennedy. I said, 'I don't mention him because I would like to win,' and we never got on after that.'' Mr. Vidal said that he ran ahead of the Kennedy-Johnson ticket by about 20,000 votes in his district. Still, Mr. Vidal lost his race.</p>
        <p>There may or may not have been a later incident in which Robert F. Kennedy interrupted a conversation between Jacqueline Kennedy and Mr. Vidal at the White House. ''There's been so much written about it that I'm not going to talk about it,'' Mr. Vidal said yesterday. Mr. Kennedy did not return a call for comment.</p>
        <p>Birthday Wishes</p>
        <p>It was a group birthday party for six celebrities born on Sept. 25. BARBARA WALTERS, the ABC News correspondent, who turned 69; the actor MICHAEL DOUGLAS, who was 56; the actress CATHERINE ZETA-JONES, who was 31; RON MEYER, the president of Universal Studios, who was 56; SCOTT GREENSTEIN, the chairman of USA Films, who was 41; and CHRISTOPHER REEVE, the actor who was paralyzed in an accident in 1995, who was 48. But the gathering, at the apartment of ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON IV , an owner of the New York Jets, and his wife, SALE, was also a warm-up for a fund-raiser for the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation.</p>
        <p>''I remember in September '95 I was in rehab and we celebrated my birthday,'' Mr. Reeve said. ''My brother showed up with a couple of balloons, and that was it, sitting in the cafeteria and dining on fine institutional cuisine. I thought I was glad I made it to that birthday; maybe there would be better ones in the future. I never could have thought I'd reach this high mark.''</p>
        <p>Despite a broken leg, Mr. Reeve said, ''I'm doing better than I was when I left rehab.</p>
        <p>''If you stick me with a pin on the bottom of my foot,'' he said, ''the whole leg pulls away. It didn't do that until about six months ago.'' He also said he can now breathe without a respirator for an hour a day.</p>
        <p>The crowd at the party included LAUREN BACALL; LORRAINE BRACCO; KIM CATTRALL; MARIO M. CUOMO, the former governor, and his wife, MATILDA; BRYANT GUMBEL; PAUL NEWMAN; the theater producer MARTIN RICHARDS; and AL ROKER.</p>
        <p>''It's the usual scrum,'' said the actor DAN AYKROYD. ''But if it gets people to contribute some money, as I'm going to do . . . '' His voice trailed off. ''Maybe there's some hope. Maybe someday, Chris will be able to get up out of the chair.''</p>
        <p>In Praise of No. 21</p>
        <p>The dinner was an elaborate celebration of the chef DANIEL BOULUD'S 30 years of cooking and 20 years in America -- a 10-course meal featuring 30 dishes and 20 wines. Make that 21 wines, and No. 21 was B.Y.O.B. (and served only at one table).</p>
        <p>Late in the evening, DANIEL JOHNNES, the wine director of DREW NIEPORENT'S Myriad Restaurant Group, asked for ''something good.'' The sommelier, JEAN-LUC LE DU, opened a bottle that Mr. Johnnes had brought along, a magnum of Chambolle-Musigny Les Amoureuses 1989, a red wine that will go on the wine list at Mr. Boulud's restaurant, Daniel, next month. ''It's from CHRISTOPHE ROUMIER, who's one of the great ones of Burgundy,'' Mr. Boulud said. ''It was wonderful.''</p>
