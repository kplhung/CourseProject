        <p>The polite, if strained, cooperation that has long marked the relationship between  France's two leaders -- President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin -- came apart today as their supporters hurled accusations of corruption and political manipulation at each other.</p>
        <p>Each side said the other was trying to wiggle away from its role in the growing scandal springing from a videotaped confession that charges Mr. Chirac with running a vast illicit fund-raising scheme when he was mayor of Paris and the leader of his conservative Rally for the Republic party.</p>
        <p>While it is Mr. Chirac who is directly accused in the videotape, the scandal has also engulfed Mr. Jospin since it became known Monday that his former finance minister had the tape for two years without turning it over to authorities. Tonight, authorities officially placed the former minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, under investigation.</p>
        <p>But the parties seemed to be competing to tar each other with the scandal, even as new evidence  emerged suggesting that the man who made the tape, a former party official who died of cancer last year, was paid off not to go public with his story.</p>
        <p>Members of Mr. Chirac's party lashed out at Mr. Jospin for denying any knowledge of the tape, which had been given to Mr. Strauss-Kahn in the summer of 1998. Mr. Jospin has said he knew nothing of the tape until he read transcripts from it in the daily Le Monde last week.</p>
        <p>''I find it astonishing that the prime minister, as soon as there is a problem, never has any knowledge of it,'' said Michele Alliot-Marie, the current president of Mr. Chirac's party. ''I find that astonishing, even worrying.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jospin, at a Socialist meeting in Lyon, did not refer to Mr. Chirac by name, but said the uproar over Mr. Strauss-Kahn should not overshadow the ''serious nature'' of the cases. Jean-Marc Ayrault, the Socialist floor leader in the National Assembly, went further, reminding Mr. Chirac that he would not always enjoy presidential immunity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chirac has vehemently denied the charges on the tape made by Jean-Claude Mery, a developer who was a member of the Rally for the Republic governing committee in the 1980's. According to transcripts published in Le Monde, Mr. Mery gave a detailed description of how he ran a huge network of kickback schemes that netted the party millions of dollars a year. On the tape, he says that he worked under the instructions of Mr. Chirac and that he was even present one day when Mr. Mery gave a Chirac aide about $700,000 in cash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mery, who had already spent five months in jail as an investigating magistrate pursued his inquiry of the party for illicit fund-raising, says on the tape that he is making it because he wanted to protect himself and because promises made to him had not been kept.</p>
        <p>The tape emerged last week when a journalist, Arnaud Hamelin, who had helped Mr. Mery make the tape, took it to Le Monde. Mr. Mery had wanted the tape to be made public if he died under suspicious circumstances. The journalist was authorized to do what he wanted with the tape if Mr. Mery died of natural causes, as he did.</p>
        <p>Today, Le Monde said investigators searching a bank vault had found two letters Mr. Mery had written addressed simply to ''Mr. President.'' In them, he complained that he had been paid only about $13,000 for staying quiet.</p>
        <p>Despite searching both the home and office of Mr. Strauss-Kahn on Monday night, investigators have not found the original copy of the videotape. The weekly magazine L'Express, which first reported that Mr. Strauss-Kahn had the tape, said it had been given to him by a lawyer who helped Mr. Mery make his tape in exchange for a huge tax break for one of his other clients, Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion designer. Mr. Lagerfeld today denied any impropriety in the handling of his taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who was forced  to resign his ministerial post last year after allegations of false accounting at his law firm, also denied all wrongdoing in the case. He said Mr. Lagerfeld had eventually paid about half of what he owed in a negotiated transaction that was a routine way of handling such cases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Strauss-Kahn urged everyone to focus on the real issue: the implication of the chief of state in a funding scandal. ''The tree must not hide the forest,'' Mr. Strauss-Kahn said today on Europe 1 radio.</p>
