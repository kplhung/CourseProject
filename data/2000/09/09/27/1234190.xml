        <p>The Mets had clinched nothing more than a tie for a postseason spot before last night's loss to the Atlanta Braves.

        <p>The Mets had clinched nothing more than a tie for a postseason spot before last night's loss to the Atlanta Braves. For that reason, they treaded lightly around questions about the playoffs, which will begin next Wednesday at San Francisco or St. Louis -- whichever has the better record -- should the Mets hold their wild-card spot.</p>
        <p>''For reasons of superstition, probably, we have not sat down and discussed the playoff roster yet,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Phillips quickly amended that statement. He had spoken with Manager Bobby Valentine once, just moments before, about how many position players and pitchers the Mets would take. Valentine thought the Mets were locked into 14 position players and 11 pitchers; Phillips informed him the Mets can also go with a 15-10 or 16-9 arrangement.</p>
        <p>The final roster spot seems to be coming down to a choice of one player from a group including the reliever Pat Mahomes, infielder-outfielder Joe McEwing and outfielder Bubba Trammell. The more significant matter is probably the starting rotation for the division series. Mike Hampton's final start of the regular season will be on Friday against Montreal, which would give him four days of rest to start Game 1, if the Mets are the wild-card entry.</p>
        <p>Hampton figures to be the only starter who would go on the normal four days' rest. ''We'll put everything in a computer and see what it spits out,'' the pitching coach Dave Wallace said. ''Who we're playing, where we're playing, and the most important thing -- what a guy's regular-work turn is going to be. No matter what kind of plan you have, it's going to change.''</p>
        <p>Wallace said certain pitchers, like Al Leiter, do better with more rest.</p>
