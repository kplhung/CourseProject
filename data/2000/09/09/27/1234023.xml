        <p>What is the opposite of a metaphorical black hole? Imagine a void created by light instead of darkness, emanating from art that so fetishizes purity that it abandons any trace of the real.</p>
        <p>Postmodern artists like David Lynch have found horror within such chasms of goodness; satirists have exposed them as shallow. But sometimes the golden hole produces its own auteur whose rendering of a stainless world is a kind of revelation. That's what the lyric soprano Sarah Brightman, who appeared on Friday night at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, has become.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brightman became famous as the muse who married the musical theater baron Andrew Lloyd Webber. Since their divorce she has found another collaborator in Frank Peterson, cofounder of the group Enigma, which brought Gregorian chant to the dance floor in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>The Enigma idea of absorbing generic and historical differences within a wash of beats and effects has hugely influenced pop. Ms. Brightman and Mr. Peterson have taken it to an extreme by by blending opera, show tunes, deep house, ambient techno and big-ballad schlock. The binder is Ms. Brightman's voice, an instrument as airy as beaten egg whites.</p>
        <p>Classical-pop hybrids are always popular, but Ms. Brightman makes hers contemporary by widening her selection to include art rock by bands like Procol Harum and Queen. She also turns the soprano's usual angelic persona into a science-fiction fantasy. A stage show based on her latest album, ''La Luna'' (Angel), allowed her to realize this quaint futurism completely, as she played her otherworldly role in front of a rock band augmented with a string section.</p>
        <p>In costumes ranging from a cobweb dress to an enormous red skirt that her dancers unfurled as she stood on a platform under a halo of tin stars, Ms. Brightman seemed less like a celestial being than a cyborg. She sang two songs while suspended from wires, doing back flips during the encore. She communicated through hieroglyphics of arm gestures, her face set in a mystical glaze, as she sang popular arias, nondescript ballads and a few Lloyd Webber tunes.</p>
        <p>She might have been computer-generated, freed from the burden of materiality. Her voice was processed so heavily that it sounded almost double-tracked and even more disembodied than on record. A disconcerting split between her heavier operatic tone and her girlish pop style reinforced the impression that she was not just a singer but a living stereo.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brightman's show presented music as a force not so much divine as post-human, a seamless soundtrack to a context-free life. This seductive vision was unintentionally disturbing: a beautiful argument for emptiness.</p>
