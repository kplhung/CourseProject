        <p>Yale Robbins Inc., a leading real estate publisher, will introduce a Web site today that is intended to help commercial tenants track down office space in New York's increasingly tight market, company officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Web site, called Mr. Office Space, will allow company real estate managers to search a database of buildings by the amount of space available, the neighborhood and the price per square foot. The site goes further than many others that list commercial office space in allowing users to create personal profiles and then alerting users of new real estate listings via e-mail.</p>

        <p>Yale Robbins Inc., a leading real estate publisher, will introduce a Web site today that is intended to help commercial tenants track down office space in New York's increasingly tight market, company officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Web site, called Mr. Office Space, will allow company real estate managers to search a database of buildings by the amount of space available, the neighborhood and the price per square foot. The site goes further than many others that list commercial office space in allowing users to create personal profiles and then alerting users of new real estate listings via e-mail.</p>
        <p>The site, which will be updated daily, covers about 400 million square feet of space in New York City, and is being introduced at a time when property managers are increasingly looking for new tools as rents increase to some of their highest levels in years. The site's address is www.mrofficespace.com.</p>
        <p>Henry Robbins, the president of Yale Robbins, which publishes Office Buildings magazine, said the company had decided to move into the online market to lure people to its other publications and prevent dot-com companies from capturing customers interested in online real estate searches.</p>
        <p>He said Yale Robbins had hired several researchers to visit commercial buildings in New York so the company can update listings, which include pictures, 3-D tours and other features.</p>
        <p>''It makes the job of those looking for real estate a little bit easier,'' Mr. Robbins said, ''because they will be able to do their homework before they ever get to a broker.''</p>
        <p>The Web site will allow users free access and will post basic listings for landlords at no charge. Yale Robbins plans to make money by charging landlords for more elaborate listings that include additional pictures and the 3-D tours, Mr. Robbins said.</p>
