        <p>The government-controlled Federal Election Commission announced tonight that President Slobodan Milosevic was trailing his challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, but rejected Mr. Kostunica's claim to an outright victory.</p>
        <p>The commission said the opposition candidate had fallen short of the 50 percent required for a first-round win and called for a runoff to take place on Oct. 8. Opposition leaders immediately called the commission's figures fraudulent and said they would not take part in a runoff. They said that Mr. Kostunica had won almost 55 percent of the votes, and that he said he had rejected a government feeler, through intermediaries, for a second round.</p>
        <p>''This is an offer that must be rejected,'' Mr. Kostunica said in a statement. ''The victory is obvious, and we will defend it by all nonviolent means. The people have given their political no to Milosevic and his policies. Our first duty is to carry out that verdict.''</p>
        <p>The state television broke into the main evening news program with the announcement that Mr. Milosevic, with 40.23 percent, had come in second to Mr. Kostunica, with 48.22 percent, with a turnout of about 64.65 percent. Opposition members of the commission said they had not been involved in the tallying.</p>
        <p>The opposition said that by its own figures, gathered from election monitors in each constituency who had signed the returns before they had been shipped to Belgrade for final approval by the election commission, Mr. Kostunica was beating Mr. Milosevic by 54.66 percent to 35.01 percent. The opposition said that the turnout had been 74 percent, and that its monitors had counted more than 98 percent of the votes.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. Kostunica declared that a second round was unnecessary. ''There is no single reason, not moral or political, by which we would accept such trampling on the electoral will of the people,'' he said. But Mr. Kostunica promised to avoid ''careless moves that could raise tensions in society, that could lead to unforeseeable consequences.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, President Clinton praised the voters and offered to remove economic sanctions if democratic change prevails against any efforts by Mr. Milosevic to ''cling to power.'' [Page A10.]</p>
        <p>The opposition has scheduled rallies in Belgrade and other cities for Wednesday night to defend what it called Mr. Kostunica's victory -- rallies that could prove confrontational, depending on how the police respond.</p>
        <p>The risk for Mr. Kostunica, a constitutional lawyer who is a moderate nationalist, an anti-Communist and a democrat, is that if the popular will proves insufficiently forceful, the boycott of a second round could let Mr. Milosevic claim an unopposed victory and remain president.</p>
        <p>In 1996 thousands of Belgrade citizens marched for three months to defend the opposition's victory in local elections, which Mr. Milosevic had challenged in the courts, before he relented.</p>
        <p>Tonight Belgrade's squares were largely empty, although some people were out on their terraces banging pots and pans, and an independent radio station, Radio Indeks, said its telephone lines were clogged by angry listeners. About 9 p.m., its signal was jammed. On the street, Ljiljana Zivkovic, 50, an accountant, said simply: ''They can't steal the votes anymore. We'll make them leave.''</p>
        <p>In the opposition strongholds of Cacak and Novi Sad, large rallies were reported, with 15,000 and 5,000 people respectively, to protest the commission's announcement.</p>
        <p>In an important message, the leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Pavle, who met with Mr. Kostunica today, urged Mr. Milosevic ''to accept the electoral will of the people and contribute to the welfare of the nation and the state.''</p>
        <p>The patriarch ''called on everyone, including the army and police, to defend the interests of people and the state rather than individuals,'' a church statement said.</p>
        <p>The official announcement on state television that Mr. Milosevic was trailing was already an extraordinary admission that the government's campaign had gone badly wrong. It followed what government officials have described as a furious debate about how to handle Mr. Milosevic's first electoral defeat ever.</p>
        <p>Proposals that Mr. Milosevic declare outright victory in the first round appear to have been rejected as too confrontational and risky.</p>
        <p>A second round, especially with Mr. Milosevic trailing, at least keeps his options open and can be taken by some Serbs as democratic and non-confrontational. It will be harder for Mr. Kostunica to complain that his victory has been stolen, given what would appear to be near certainty that he would win a second round.</p>
        <p>Most important, the tactic buys time for the government to consider its next step, and perhaps to bargain for a secure exit, especially with Western countries that have been sending word to Mr. Milosevic that his position is untenable and he must consider how to save himself from a system that could crumble rapidly.</p>
        <p>But the effort to throw the election into a second round was interpreted by the opposition as a clumsy effort by Mr. Milosevic to escape his fate.</p>
        <p>''A second round gives Milosevic 10 more days to find a pretext to call off the election, falsify it or postpone it,'' said one opposition leader. ''It's a trap for us.''</p>
        <p>Before the election on Sunday, even Mr. Kostunica said he thought a second round would be necessary and hoped that Mr. Milosevic would not cancel the election altogether. But the breadth of the anti-government swing on Sunday took the opposition by surprise.</p>
        <p>''This is a big fraud,'' said Zoran Djindjic, leader of the coalition that backs Mr. Kostunica, speaking of the call for a second round. ''In last two days, we knew that they were preparing something to get Milosevic into the second round. But we have proof of our figures, and we will defend the people's vote to the end.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Djindjic urged patience. He said the opposition would demand to see the commission's figures, and compare them with the opposition's.</p>
        <p>''We have 98 percent of the facts in our hands,'' he said. ''We know they are trying to manipulate the results from Kosovo.'' He alleged that the commission had taken 400,000 votes from Mr. Kostunica and had given 200,000 to Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The commission has 28 members, 2 from the governing coalition and 2 from the opposition coalition, but with a majority appointed by the government. Mr. Milosevic was in the shadows today, but the commission is considered to be acting on his behalf.</p>
        <p>Opposition representatives say they have been locked out of any counting. Tonight, one of Mr. Kostunica's representatives on the commission, Djordje Mamula, said at least 4 percent of Mr. Kostunica's votes had been stolen from him. ''I don't know how their gummy mathematics work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Belgraders love to reminisce about the happy days of the winter of 1996, when thousands of protesters marched every day for three months after Mr. Milosevic challenged the opposition's victories in local elections. He finally backed down.</p>
        <p>This year, the government has already conceded a huge defeat in local elections -- the opposition will govern nearly 100 towns and cities in Serbia -- but now Mr. Milosevic's own future is at stake.</p>
        <p>While Belgrade was quiet tonight, with no rally scheduled, people were angry. Snjezana, 32, a shop attendant, said: ''I'm not afraid. They can say whatever they want. But they are defeated -- history. If we have to defend our victory on the street, we'll do that. We've had enough.''</p>
        <p>A lawyer of 35, Branomir Misic, said: ''We were out on the street so many times. And this time we will be there again. There is no way out for them.''</p>
        <p>Zarko Korac, an opposition political leader, said tonight that victory could not be taken from the nearly three million people who had voted for Mr. Kostunica. ''Milosevic is fighting for his political survival,'' he said. ''But democracy is about accepting the will of the people. This was a political verdict, a referendum on Milosevic, and he lost it.''</p>
        <p>In the presidential election, Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Kostunica had three other competitors -- Tomislav Nikolic of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, who got 5.1 percent of the vote according to the election commission; Vojislav Mihailovic of the Serbian Renewal Movement, who got 2.59 percent; and Miodrag Vidojkovic of the Affirmative Party, who got 0.8 percent.</p>
        <p>People also voted for both houses of the federal Parliament. Despite the opposition's strong showing in Serbia, Mr. Milosevic will control both houses and can form a federal government with no other partners.</p>
        <p>He will do so because his allied party won the seats reserved for Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, after the Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, urged his citizens to boycott the elections, saying they were unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>In Montenegro itself, fears of a Milosevic move on Mr. Djukanovic were receding. Special police troops remained on alert and were guarding state buildings dressed in full combat gear and helmets, but Deputy Prime Minister Dragisa Burzan said in an interview that he believed that government fears that Mr. Milosevic might order the Yugoslav Army to take over government institutions or impose a state of emergency in the republic were receding.</p>
        <p>''If he survives he will be very dangerous,'' Mr. Burzan said of Mr. Milosevic. ''But now he cannot influence the generals as he could even yesterday.''</p>
