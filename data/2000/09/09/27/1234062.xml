        <p>The 3Com Corporation reported a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss today, citing a reorganization that included its exit from the analog modem and network router businesses in the previous quarter.</p>
        <p>For the quarter ended Sept. 1, 3Com posted a loss of $59.2 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with earnings of $137.5 million, or 38 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales fell 23 percent, to $933.8 million from $1.21 billion.</p>
        <p>Sales included $127.5 million from the businesses it left. Excluding that revenue, 3Com's continuing businesses accounted for $806.3 million in sales, a rise of 20 percent over comparable sales in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Excluding one-time charges and gains as well as income from discontinued operations, 3Com's quarterly loss was $41.3 million, or 12 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of 33 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Before 3Com reported its results, its shares closed at $13.94, down 6 cents, in Nasdaq trading. In after-hours trading, however, 3Com rose more than 15 percent, climbing as high as $16.06.</p>
        <p>Shares of 3Com had retreated from a 52-week high, reached before the divestiture in July of Palm Inc., which many analysts considered the most valuable part of the company. 3Com now has a market value of $4.86 billion, while Palm, which handily beat analysts' earnings estimates, is valued at $31.36 billion.</p>
        <p>''The close of our first quarter marks the completion of our restructuring,'' Eric Benhamou, the chairman and chief executive of 3Com, said in a statement. ''The transformation milestones and business objectives set forth in March 2000 and reaffirmed last quarter were completed on or ahead of schedule.''</p>
        <p>In the wake of the spinoff of Palm and the reorganization, 3Com is focused primarily on broadband products and wireless devices for consumers and small businesses, and infrastructure equipment for companies that provide telecommunications and Internet services. The move cedes much of the market for corporate networks to Cisco Systems Inc., which has proved to be the more aggressive competitor.</p>
        <p>3Com said that excluding sales from the exited businesses, first-quarter sales for its commercial and consumer networks business were $639.1 million, a 24 percent increase over the fourth quarter. First-quarter sales for its carrier networking business were $167.2 million, a rise of 7 percent from sales of $156.7 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
