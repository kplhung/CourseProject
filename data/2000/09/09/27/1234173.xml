        <p>The ratings for its prime-time Olympics coverage may be disappointing to NBC, but the ratings are doing well for the network in the morning.</p>
        <p>NBC's ''Today'' show, which has been based in Sydney since the week before the Olympics began, is doing extraordinarily well.</p>
        <p>Last week ''Today'' was watched by an average of 6.7 million people a day, more people than watched competing editions of ABC's ''Good Morning America'' and CBS's ''Early Show'' combined.</p>
        <p>The ''Today'' audience last week was the fourth largest in its 49-year history, executives said. The show drew its largest audiences in the three weeks after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. ''Today'' has been reporting the results of various events and interviewing atheletes immediately after the day of competition is completed.</p>
