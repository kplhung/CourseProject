        <p>Oh, sure, some women are embarrassed for their sex this week.</p>
        <p>But those women are wimps.</p>
        <p>I feel a certain undeniable pride that women have taken control of the two great male preserves of America -- politics and sports -- and ruined them.</p>
        <p>We finally quit fretting about piddly all-male bastions like the Century Club and the Senate and started tearing down the very pillars of masculinity. We are shaping the Olympics and the presidential race -- and now we are even redecorating the steakhouses, with silk and velvet and pink light bulbs.</p>
        <p>We have draped the gray steel of our leading warrior rituals in yards and yards of chintz. We have made them so mawkish, so hideously fluffy, so sentimental, kissy and fraught with personal travail, that these gladiatorial contests play more like those old Bette Davis/Joan Crawford weepies.</p>
        <p>This used to be guy season. Aggressive, muscular warfare focused on winning and losing, stats, handicapping, training, strategy and impenetrable debates on the modernization of the land-based leg of the nuclear triad.</p>
        <p>Now it's girl season, soaking in sentiment, soap opera, romantic walks along the lake, long, deep kisses on stage and guys making Cher-like hair and wardrobe changes.</p>
        <p>The pols and TV execs have decided that what women want is to be cuddled.</p>
        <p>In Sydney, NBC commentators get misty over a Kenyan mountain biker's ''sad eyes,'' made so by the disappearance of his brother into the woods in 1996. They laud the courage of the horse that competed despite heart trouble, neighing in the face of danger. They gush over Michael Johnson's flashing gold shoes and Elena Prodounova's elaborately styled eyebrows. They muse that Alexei Nemov's heart is not in Sydney, that this is ''not his everything anymore,'' because he missed ''the first glimpse of his baby boy.'' And oh, the injuries and maladies: heart arrhythmia, chronic fatigue syndrome, exercise-induced asthma.</p>
        <p>Why they keep wasting all that time with the actual contests is beyond me. Why not just stop at the gorgeous shots of half-naked athletes bathed in golden light, as solemn narrators describe their triumphs over heart-wrenching adversity?</p>
        <p>NBC was worried that it went soft in 1996. So this time it raised its reporting standards. ''We went out of our way,'' Dick Ebersol, president of the network's sports division, told Newsweek, ''to substantially upgrade the disease, the injuries, the life-threatening moments that qualify.''</p>
        <p>They've turned the Olympics into ''General Hospital.'' I keep waiting for an update on the condition of the ''Agony of Defeat'' guy.</p>
        <p>After years of talking down to us in politics and sports, instructing us on whom to root for, men finally figured out that women are the uber-shoppers. We control the ballot and the clicker.</p>
        <p>We are the new party bosses. Our rooms are perfumed, not smoke-filled, but we are the vetters. Even in the arena now, the men approach on bended knee, proffering posies. Our questions are quite different from those once asked by the Council on Foreign Relations and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Are they good kissers? Doting hubbies and dads? Fun-loving?</p>
        <p>Some of my girlfriends moan that they feel ashamed, that women have  trivialized the political race and diminished themselves by responding to such goop. (At least the gauzy Olympics aren't getting good ratings.)</p>
        <p>One convention smooch sent the women scurrying over to Al Gore's side. Then one teary little chat with Oprah about his wife's difficult pregnancy and his love of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches sent the women scampering back to W.</p>
        <p>W. and Laura went on Larry King last night and Al and Tipper are going on tomorrow night -- a connubial face-off to see Who Loves His Wife More, and More Openly.</p>
        <p>Sure, it can all be a little much. But it has to count as progress in our gender games.</p>
        <p>Alan Dundes, a folklorist and professor of anthropology at Berkeley, has written that through history the essential theme of all competitions has been this: ''One male demonstrates his virility, his masculinity, at the expense of a male opponent. One proves one's maleness by feminizing one's opponent.''</p>
        <p>Now, to win, men have to feminize themselves. Game over.</p>
