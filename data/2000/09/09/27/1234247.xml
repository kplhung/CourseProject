        <p>WHITFORD-Josephine C. The Manhattan School of Music is saddened by the loss of longtime friend and beloved dean for more than 40 years, Josephine Whitford. Ms. Whitford came to the school in 1931 and remained active as part of the administration until 1984 when she was awarded an honorary doctoral degree for her years of dedication and service. Her strong-willed personality, intellect, compassion and generosity enriched the lives of generations of students. She leaves an enduring legacy and will be missed by all who knew her. David A.
