        <p>Shaun Williams, a first-round draft pick now in his first year as a starter for the Giants, failed an important test Sunday night against the Washington Redskins. He knows that another test will come this Sunday against the Tennessee Titans, and he says he embraces the chances.</p>

That's the good thing about it -- there will be more opportunities for me to make a play or not make a play.''</p>

        <p>Shaun Williams, a first-round draft pick now in his first year as a starter for the Giants, failed an important test Sunday night against the Washington Redskins. He knows that another test will come this Sunday against the Tennessee Titans, and he says he embraces the chances.</p>
        <p>''This is a copycat league,'' said Williams, a free safety. ''You know teams see mistakes you've made prior and they try to attack those things. You have to prove to them that it's not a weakness. I'm sure teams are going to try to come at me, and see if they can make a play. That's the good thing about it -- there will be more opportunities for me to make a play or not make a play.''</p>
        <p>Williams tried hard to see the positives in his otherwise disastrous encounter with the Redskins, when he allowed Brad Johnson to connect on three long pass plays, each leading to a Redskins score in Washington's 16-6 victory.</p>
        <p>This was on Monday afternoon in the Giants' locker room, before Williams had seen film of the game. He knew he would be viewing the film later in the day, and so would the Titans, meaning that the chance for redemption was less than a week away.</p>
        <p>Williams moved into the starting lineup this season for the first time in his three-year career, taking over at free safety for Percy Ellsworth. He did not need to watch the film to understand his blunders. The image of his stumbling backward on the sideline as Albert Connell leaped in front of him for a 53-yard reception on the Redskins' opening drive of the second half was featured in nearly every newspaper in the New York region.</p>
        <p>Williams also knew what he had to do this week. ''Basically, just focus in this week, be ready to play better, and try to put that behind me,'' he said. ''I kind of took three steps forward and 10 steps back this week. It's frustrating. I felt like I let my team down, let my family down. But I'm a competitor, so I'm going to be back.''</p>
        <p>Williams had played exceptionally well in the first three games of the season, all Giants victories, and he was beginning to fulfill the promise that led the Giants to select him out of U.C.L.A. in the first round of the 1998 draft. He had played well this year despite having missed all four preseason games with a sprained toe. He had an interception in the Giants' opening-day victory over Arizona and ranks third on the team in tackles.</p>
        <p>''He didn't have a good game,'' Coach Jim Fassel said of Williams's performance against Washington. ''He has played very well up until Sunday night, and it was not a good game for him at all, and he knows that.''</p>
        <p>Williams's troubles began in the second quarter when he charged forward toward a receiver running a short route and left cornerback Dave Thomas alone to chase James Thrasher, who caught a pass deep in the middle of the secondary for a 46-yard gain. On the next play, the Redskins scored the game's first points on a 23-yard pass from Johnson to Irving Fryar.</p>
        <p>On Connell's 53-yard pass play, Williams was actually in range to make a play, but positioned himself incorrectly as he headed for the ball, allowing Connell to slip inside and make the catch.</p>
        <p>''There was no trickery about it,'' Williams said. ''I just made bad decisions when the time came. I think that's one of the worst games I've played in my life, on any level. I'm very disappointed in myself. I've got another week to come out and play.</p>
        <p>''It was little mental errors, not making plays I need to make, not being where I need to be, as far as in the deep middle a couple times.</p>
        <p>''They made big plays, and you can't give up big plays if you want to win, especially not playing a team like the Redskins.</p>
        <p>''Our team was counting on me, and I didn't play big. I played terrible. It's one game. We have 12 more games to go.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' defensive backs coach, Johnnie Lynn, said that Williams could now expect opponents to test him vigorously.</p>
        <p>''Physically, if you get beat is one thing, because we're not all blessed the same,'' Lynn said. ''But mental mistakes, you like to get into position to give yourself a chance. This is a repeat league. Nobody is creating anything new. Everybody runs the same types of routes or something that's comparable. If something works, you're going to see it the next week.''</p>
