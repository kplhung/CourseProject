        <p>Senator Joseph Lieberman has only a month to end his safety-net campaign in Connecticut, where he is running for a third term in the Senate as well as for vice president on Al Gore's ticket. His Democratic colleagues in the Senate are pressing him to drop the Senate re-election bid lest his seat be lost if the national ticket wins. Even his own constituents oppose his dual candidacy by a narrow margin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman should take the hints and resign quickly from the Senate race. That would give state party leaders a chance to put another candidate or candidates on the ballot.</p>

        <p>Senator Joseph Lieberman has only a month to end his safety-net campaign in Connecticut, where he is running for a third term in the Senate as well as for vice president on Al Gore's ticket. His Democratic colleagues in the Senate are pressing him to drop the Senate re-election bid lest his seat be lost if the national ticket wins. Even his own constituents oppose his dual candidacy by a narrow margin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman should take the hints and resign quickly from the Senate race. That would give state party leaders a chance to put another candidate or candidates on the ballot.</p>
        <p>With a line that sounds more self-protective than public-spirited, Mr. Lieberman has maintained that if he drops out of his Senate race this late, voters will be deprived of a primary before the Nov. 7 election. But if he wins the vice presidency, Connecticut voters are deprived of any choice at all for as much as two years under the state's flawed election law. One person -- Connecticut's Republican governor -- would choose the new senator from the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman has mistakenly refused to budge from his position, saying that he and the people of Connecticut have ''agreed to disagree'' on this issue. This situation may suit Mr. Lieberman's job security needs, but it does not serve democracy or his Connecticut constituents well.</p>
