        <p>First, a partition was raised, expanding the grandstand at the Olympic boxing site by 2,000 seats. Then the arena lights darkened. The sound system played louder and faster-paced music.</p>
        <p>At ringside, there were sports and Hollywood celebrities, and in the cheap seats, several thousand more fans than there had been on any of the past 10 days. Outside, on a plaza overlooking Sydney's Darling Harbor, scalpers peddled tickets.</p>
        <p>Today, the Sydney Olympic boxing tournament got serious. Today, the quality fighters braced their feet and threw punches with unfeigned malice. The medal rounds await, and everything about the tournament has become a little bigger, louder, faster.</p>
        <p>Little of this was good news for the Americans in the field. Or those bounced from it, a number that swelled to seven today. The darlings of Darling Harbor in the preliminaries, only one member of the United States team matched the increased intensity that accompanied the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>If not for Clarence Vinson, who fought spectacularly in defeating the reigning bantamweight world champion, Olteanu George-Crinu of Romania, by 26-19 on points, the United States would have been shut out.</p>
        <p>The American Michael Bennett lost his bid to unseat the famed Cuban heavyweight Felix Savon, who stopped Bennett on points, 23-8, at the end of the third round. The United States middleweight Jeff Lacy didn't get out of the third round either, losing on points to the Russian Gaidarbek Gaidarbekov, 18-3. In the Olympics, bouts are stopped if one fighter trails by 15 points.</p>
        <p>While two of three Americans were wilting today, the Cuban team continued its unrelenting march through the brackets. Only 2 of 12 Cubans have lost, and today, 5 Cubans advanced to the semifinals. They include the middleweight Jorge Gutierrez, who won with a one-punch first-round knockout.</p>
        <p>The feature of the day was Savon against Bennett, a fight that brought something of a championship atmosphere to the arena. What developed was an action-packed fight, one that seemed closer than the judges' totals, although Savon clearly had a command of the ring and a huge reach advantage on Bennett.</p>
        <p>But United States Coach Tom Mustin believed that Savon, a six-time world champion, received points for his reputation. ''The judges gave Savon too many points for right hands that landed on Bennett's arms and shoulders,'' Mustin said. ''I thought the fight was getting closer, and if it kept going, there would have been a great fourth round.</p>
        <p>''Maybe when Savon throws that right, they just expect it to land, so they score it. But Michael wasn't getting hit in the head. At the end of the fight, one of the officials said Savon was the one who looked hurt.''</p>
        <p>Fighting in 75-kilogram class, Lacy had knocked out one opponent and stopped another in the second round. But today against Gaidarbekov, a 24-year-old with little international or major competition experience, Lacy looked timid and overmatched.</p>
        <p>In a spirited 54-kilogram quarterfinal, Vinson traded combinations with George-Crinu across four lively rounds. Vinson was cut across the bridge of his nose in the third round but responded with punches in flurries that left George-Crinu's face red and swollen, and in the end, a loser.</p>
        <p>George-Crinu, four years older than the 22-year-old Vinson, appeared stronger and was unyielding in his advances. But Vinson, who fought after Bennett and Lacy had lost, stood his ground and threw dozens of punches.</p>
        <p>''It really hurt to see those guys lose,'' Vinson said. ''But Michael Bennett came to me and said: 'I fell off the ship. You've got to handle it now.' And he was right. I needed a win and the team needed a win.''</p>
        <p>Savon forfeited his chance to face Bennett in last year's world championship final, allowing Bennett a victory as a way of protesting a controversial decision against a teammate earlier in the competition. Some wondered whether the American could crack Cuba's mythic champion, who is now 33 years old.</p>
        <p>That Bennett, 29, has been fighting competitively for only two years after having served seven years in jail for armed robbery added intrigue to today's bout. Bennett did not figure to be awed by Savon, a two-time defending Olympic heavyweight champion, and indeed, he wasn't. Bennett fought aggressively from the beginning, landing the fight's first punch, and continued to throw lefts and rights even as he was being backed up.</p>
        <p>But the 6-foot-6 1/2-inch Savon is more than half a foot taller than Bennett, and he kept the American at arm's length for most of the fight. His right hand, one of the most famed weapons in Olympic boxing history, scores points -- justly or not -- with startling frequency.</p>
        <p>Bennett stunned Savon briefly with a crisp right hand early in the third round, but Savon kept piling up points, and just as the round ended, the score was 23-8. ''Savon was the better warrior today,'' Bennett said afterward. ''I did my best.''</p>
        <p>Getting inside Savon's reach was harder than he expected, Bennett conceded. Bennett had also planned to avoid getting into a slugfest. But he acknowledged that it was easier to talk about and harder to do when being hit by an opponent every few seconds.</p>
        <p>Savon, as has been his custom throughout the Sydney Games, did not speak with reporters afterward. He was unusually animated in the ring, briefly taunting Bennett, and he left his corner after the fight smiling and waving his arms at the crowd.</p>
        <p>Savon is now the runaway favorite to join the other great heavyweight never to turn professional, Cuba's Teofilo Stevenson, as a three-time gold medalist in the same weight class (91 kilograms).</p>
