        <p>The Eastman Kodak Company, citing a sudden and as yet unexplained sales decline in every one of its businesses, warned investors yesterday that its third-quarter earnings would be as much as 25 cents a share below expectations and that, if sales do not pick up, fourth-quarter earnings might disappoint as well.</p>
        <p>''After a strong August, we're seeing slowness everywhere,'' a perplexed Robert H. Brust, Kodak's chief financial officer, told analysts in a hastily arranged conference call yesterday. ''We're combing the woods to see what's causing this.''</p>

        <p>The Eastman Kodak Company, citing a sudden and as yet unexplained sales decline in every one of its businesses, warned investors yesterday that its third-quarter earnings would be as much as 25 cents a share below expectations and that, if sales do not pick up, fourth-quarter earnings might disappoint as well.</p>
        <p>''After a strong August, we're seeing slowness everywhere,'' a perplexed Robert H. Brust, Kodak's chief financial officer, told analysts in a hastily arranged conference call yesterday. ''We're combing the woods to see what's causing this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brust said that third-quarter revenue would probably fall short of expectations by $200 million to $300 million. Most troubling, he said, the declines were coming at the tail end of September, traditionally the strongest part of the quarter.</p>
        <p>No one seems certain if the drop is a one-time blip or a sign of long-term woes, but investors clearly expect the worst. They sent Kodak shares plunging $14.81 a share yesterday, or 25 percent, to $44.19, the lowest level in more than six years.</p>
        <p>Until yesterday Kodak had predicted  earnings of $1.56 to $1.66 a share, while the analysts' consensus was $1.60 a share.</p>
        <p>Many analysts lowered their earnings estimates for this year and next by about 10 percent and pulled their buy recommendations off the stock. ''There's clearly a loss of faith in the company,'' said Charles L. Hill, director of research at First Call/ Thompson Financial.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that Kodak's announcement was particularly shocking in that the mood among retailers at Photokina, the huge photography exhibition in Germany that is held twice a year and ended this week, was very upbeat.</p>
        <p>''The sense we got is that demand is robust, and that Kodak's third quarter seemed on track,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Theories were rife on Wall Street yesterday about what went wrong. Some analysts suggested that high energy prices and the wet summer had cut into consumer vacations, curtailing picture-taking.</p>
        <p>But others suggested that Kodak's retail customers were trying to lower their inventories and might rush back with large orders in October. They noted other photography-related companies were having similar woes. For example, Lexmark International, which makes photo-capable printers, also issued an earnings warning, partly attributable to sluggish sales of inkjet printer cartridges.</p>
        <p>''Trends don't change overnight, and people don't stop taking pictures overnight,'' said Ulysses Yannas, an analyst with Buckman, Buckman &amp; Reid and one of the few to maintain a strong buy on Kodak stock.</p>
        <p>Nor is there a universal pall over the photographic industry. Stephen Giordano, the president of Digital Now Inc., which sells equipment and software to convert photographs to digital images, says he is seeing ''explosive growth'' in sales. ''Kodak's digital business should be growing as fast as we are,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fuji Photofilm USA recently told analysts that its film sales were sluggish but its photographic paper sales were strong. And Michelle Lampmann, an analyst for Infotrends Research Group, says all digital cameras are selling well.</p>
        <p>Indeed, until yesterday, Kodak, which is based in Rochester, seemed to be flying high, too. It had met or exceeded earnings expectations in the last six quarters. It had not faced a price war in film for a while, its digital losses had been greatly reduced, and its cost-cutting programs were on track.</p>
        <p>It has also made headway in sales on the Internet. Just this week it revamped its Web home page to look less corporate and more like an Internet home for amateur photography enthusiasts. ''That should really help them drive revenue from the Web,'' said Lia M. Schubert, an internet research analyst at Infotrends.</p>
        <p>But Web sales and such will never offer Kodak the lush profit margins of conventional film, and that means the company has less leeway to combat setbacks. ''With a lower-margin mix of products, film sales have to work even harder to make up for shortfalls,'' said Benjamin A. Reitzes, an analyst at PaineWebber. ''And that's put a long-term cloud over the company.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Kodak's problems may be more macro than micro. Analysts have told First Call that they expect sluggish third-quarter earnings reports from retailers, too. And Jack L. Kelly, a conglomerate analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, noted that Rockwell International, Ingersoll-Rand and many other capital goods companies had issued earnings warnings.</p>
        <p>''Kodak's problems may represent just another dot to connect in a picture of an economy that is slowing across the board,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Whatever its cause, the sales decline could not have come at a worse time for Kodak. Its raw materials prices have skyrocketed, while a persistently weak euro caused a $50 million currency-translation hit to third-quarter sales.</p>
        <p>Kodak's graphics business is struggling, as digital technologies continue to supplant the need for Kodak films. Kodak's own digital portfolio still loses money. And Fuji is doubling its capacity for making films and papers in the United States early next year, a move that many analysts expect might set off a price war.</p>
        <p>''The sales decline has made it impossible for us to offset these other issues,'' Mr. Brust said.</p>
