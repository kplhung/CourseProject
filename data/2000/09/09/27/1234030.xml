        <p>Honors</p>
        <p>The novelist, poet and nonfiction writer Evan S. Connell, whose fiction includes ''Mrs. Bridge'' and ''Mr. Bridge,'' today was named the recipient of this year's $100,000 Lannan Literary Award for lifetime achievement. Other awards totaling $600,000 from the Lannan Foundation of Santa Fe, N.M., are being given to Herbert Morris and Jay Wright for poetry; Robert Coover, David Malouf, Cynthia Ozick and Leslie Marmon Silko for fiction; and Bill McKibben and Carl Safina for nonfiction.</p>
        <p>Out of Africa</p>
        <p>Thrones, pipes, masks, staffs and dolls used by kings and queens, priestesses and diviners. These are among more than 140 objects that reflect the influences of the supernatural in spiritual and secular life in sub-Saharan Africa that go on view today at the Museum for African Art, 593 Broadway, near Houston Street, in SoHo. Continuing through Dec. 31, ''In the Presence of Spirits: African Art From the National Museum of Ethnology, Lisbon'' consists primarily of artworks from Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. This show begins a 16-month tour destined for Flint, Mich.; Washington; and Birmingham, Ala.</p>
        <p>Heaven on Earth</p>
        <p>Simultaneously angelic and alien, the voices heard on ''Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares'' turned that album into a hit more than a decade ago. Since then the Bulgarian State Radio and Television Female Choir has divided into several groups, but the sound, with its Eastern and Islamic influences, remains mesmerizing. At 7 on Sunday night one of these groups, the 20-member Bulgarian Women's Choir Angelite, will perform at Town Hall in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ruskin Recalled</p>
        <p>He was the most influential British critic of his time. He led the movement to record endangered medieval architecture before it vanished. He was a master of English prose who addressed the social, environmental and economic ills of his day, as well as the story of his own tormented life. He was John Ruskin (1819-1900), subject of the current play ''The Countess.'' Beginning tomorrow the Morgan Library will assemble drawings, photographs, diaries, letters, books and other objects from its own collection in ''Ruskin's Italy, Ruskin's England,'' which observes the centenary of his death. Among the artists represented are Edward Coley Burne-Jones, Anthony van Dyck, Copley Fielding, Kate Greenaway, William Turner and Ruskin himself. The exhibition continues through Jan. 7.</p>
