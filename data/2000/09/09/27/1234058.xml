        <p>THINGS have not been working out so well lately for Register.com.</p>
        <p>The New York-based company, which registers Internet domain names for companies and individuals, sold shares to the public on March 3, just as the frenzy for Internet companies peaked. Within weeks, Register stock soared from $24 to $116, giving the fledging company a market capitalization of $5 billion.</p>
        <p>It has been downhill from there. First, Internet fever broke. As the Nasdaq plunged, Register shares fell to $30 by mid-June, wiping almost $4 billion off the company's valuation. The shares bounced around the $30's for about a month, until Register's management decided to offer an additional four million shares to investors. Making matters worse, the company was selling only 500,000 of the shares, with the remaining 3.5 million coming from executives and other shareholders.</p>

        <p>THINGS have not been working out so well lately for Register.com.</p>
        <p>The New York-based company, which registers Internet domain names for companies and individuals, sold shares to the public on March 3, just as the frenzy for Internet companies peaked. Within weeks, Register stock soared from $24 to $116, giving the fledging company a market capitalization of $5 billion.</p>
        <p>It has been downhill from there. First, Internet fever broke. As the Nasdaq plunged, Register shares fell to $30 by mid-June, wiping almost $4 billion off the company's valuation. The shares bounced around the $30's for about a month, until Register's management decided to offer an additional four million shares to investors. Making matters worse, the company was selling only 500,000 of the shares, with the remaining 3.5 million coming from executives and other shareholders.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the company released second-quarter results showing that its share of the market for registering new domain names had fallen from 18 percent to 13 percent in the second quarter, with registrations plunging from 923,000 to 710,000.</p>
        <p>The culprit: an explosion in the number of companies competing to register domain names. Sixty-three companies are now accredited to register names, and 100 more have applied to enter the business, according to Verisign Global Registry Services, which runs the servers that look up names. Many of the new competitors have undercut Register's standard price of $35 to register a name for a year.</p>
        <p>A few months before, Wall Street might have shrugged off the bad news and lapped up the new shares. But not after April's meltdown. In essence, investors said that if Register's management did not want to own its stock, they did not either. In the two weeks after the announcement of the secondary offering, Register shares lost almost half their value.</p>
        <p>The secondary offering created ''a confidence issue,'' said Richard D. Forman, Register's chief executive, who filed to sell more than 800,000 shares. ''People believed that we were prepared to sell even as the stock price continued to drop.''</p>
        <p>Finally, on Aug. 9, the company withdrew the secondary offering. But the damage had been done. Over the last two months, Register shares have continued to slide. They closed yesterday at $6.75, a new low. At that level, Register's total market valuation is a meager $297 million.</p>
        <p>So why bother with Register? Because at these prices, the company might be worth another look.</p>
        <p>Sure, just because a stock has fallen 94 percent does not mean it is cheap. Faced with mounting losses and questionable business plans, many Internet stocks have lost 90 percent or more of their value in the last few months.</p>
        <p>But Register has a couple of things many Internet companies do not have. Its balance sheet is loaded with cash, about $180 million at the end of the second quarter. Even more important, it is likely to turn slightly profitable in the fourth quarter and be solidly profitable for all of 2001, analysts say.</p>
        <p>After losing about 10 cents a share this year, Register is expected to earn 21 cents a share next year, according to I.B.E.S., which tracks analysts' estimates. As a result, Register can survive without having to raise new cash. ''They have a business model that doesn't have debt, and they don't need access to the capital markets,'' said Todd Weller, an Internet analyst at Legg Mason.</p>
        <p>That gives the company a crucial advantage over money-losing competitors that must overcome investors' current skepticism about Internet companies to raise cash. And if Register's rivals wither, the pressure the company faces on prices and market share may ease.</p>
        <p>The market for new domain names, which rose from 500,000 in the third quarter of 1998 to 1.5 million in the third quarter of 1999 to 5.6 million in the second quarter of this year, is about to get another lift.</p>
        <p>By the end of the year, domain names will be available in non-English characters, greatly widening the international market for new names. And by sometime in 2001, the nonprofit body that supervises the Internet is expected to add two to six new ''top-level domains,'' like .shopping or .bank, to the current group, which includes .com, .org and .net.</p>
        <p>That could lead to an explosion in the number of names that are to be registered, said Chuck Jones, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst. Most analysts predict that about 150 million domain names will be registered over the next several years, but Mr. Jones said the new characters and domains could swell that total to 500 million.</p>
        <p>The ultimate impact of the new top-level domains on Register is hard to quantify. But it will not be negative, said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Wit Soundview. ''The company is poised for a rebound in the fourth quarter as investors begin to speculate about the impact,'' Mr. Rohan said.</p>
        <p>And with all that cash in the bank, and profits on the near horizon, Register looks much better at $6.75 than it did at $116.</p>
