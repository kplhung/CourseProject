        <p>N.Y.U. Unscrambles Its Housing</p>
        <p>With housing at a premium in New York City, local colleges and universities have had to scramble to house all their students. This semester, New York University put 240 students into two Midtown hotels for about a month while a new dormitory it is leasing was being finished.

        <p>N.Y.U. Unscrambles Its Housing</p>
        <p>With housing at a premium in New York City, local colleges and universities have had to scramble to house all their students. This semester, New York University put 240 students into two Midtown hotels for about a month while a new dormitory it is leasing was being finished. Most have been at the Park Central Hotel on Seventh Avenue at 56th Street, where rooms cost $329 a night.</p>
        <p>N.Y.U., which this year is housing more than 10,000 students, says it is not paying nearly that much. The university said that the students had been on a waiting list either because they were late in applying for housing or sending in a deposit, or because they had moved out of N.Y.U. housing and now wanted to re-enter it. This week, the hotel occupants began moving into the new dormitory, Coral Towers, at Third Avenue and 14th Street.</p>
        <p>Chancellor Hires Data Sifter</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor HAROLD O. LEVY has complained in recent months that data produced by the Board of Education is often indecipherable or  inaccurate. Hoping to solve that problem, he has hired ANDREW REIN, formerly of the city's Independent Budget Office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rein, who used to study city spending and write reports to help the public understand it, will look at everything from test scores to teacher salaries to enrollment figures and try to spot trends that have been overlooked. He says his assignment is to ''help people both within and outside the system sift through information to understand what's really going on.''</p>
        <p>Fairleigh Dickinson Inaugurating President</p>
        <p>Fairleigh Dickinson University will inaugurate its new president today at the university's Teaneck, N.J., campus. DR. J. MICHAEL ADAMS, a specialist in strategic planning and career development who had been an academic dean at Drexel University in Philadelphia and who has been president since July 1999, will now be formally  given the office. GRETCHEN JOHNSON, a spokeswoman for the university, said that the 14-month planning period was typical of inaugurations.</p>
        <p>Steinhardt Gives $10 Million to N.Y.U.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL H. STEINHARDT's name is already on a gallery of Greek antiquities at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Now it is going on the school of education at New York University, which will be known as the Steinhardt School of Education. A former hedge-fund manager who has been active in Jewish philanthropy, Mr. Steinhardt, who is also an N.Y.U. trustee, is giving $10 million to the university.</p>
        <p>Admissions Director at Ethical Culture</p>
        <p>The Ethical Culture Fieldston School has named a new director of admissions and financial aid. JAMES C. THOMPSON, who until June was director of special gifts at Columbia University, took over the Ethical Culture Fieldston position this month. Mr. Thompson earned a bachelor's and master's degree at Middlebury College, and worked there as coordinator of the Middlebury College Minority Issues Group, and as the director of the college's partnership with DeWitt Clinton High School, before moving to Columbia.</p>
        <p>St. Joseph's Completes Upgrade</p>
        <p>St. Joseph's College last week completed a two-year, $1.4 million upgrade of biology and chemistry laboratories at its Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, campus. The project was financed by alumni and donors, including the Independence Community Foundation, Pfizer and the Louis Calder Foundation.</p>
