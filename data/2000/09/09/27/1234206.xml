        <p>The future of the Islanders is going to the minors.</p>
        <p>To no one's surprise, goaltender Rick DiPietro, the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft, was cut in training camp yesterday along with two others as the roster was trimmed to 23 players.</p>
        <p>DiPietro, who was not able to play in any of the Islanders' first four preseason games because of a pulled groin muscle sustained on Sept. 20, went to the Chicago Wolves of the International Hockey League, while forward Jeff Toms was sent to Springfield of the American Hockey League.</p>
        <p>Raffi Torres, the left wing who was the Islanders' second pick in the draft, was sent back to Brampton of the Ontario Hockey League.</p>
        <p>''It is not an evaluation of performance, because we just didn't have enough time to do that,'' General Manager Mike Milbury said of the DiPietro move, calling it a decision based on circumstance. ''I'm disappointed we weren't able to get a better read, but we all know where we're going in goal for the long range.''</p>
        <p>DiPietro, who practiced Monday in full pads for the first time since the injury, could have played next Sunday against the Rangers or Monday against the Devils in the final exhibition game, but Milbury said it was important for No. 1 goaltender John Vanbiesbrouck to get as much time as possible before the regular season.</p>
        <p>DiPietro, who just turned 19, said he was disappointed with the news but understood the logic. It's kind of tough for me to swallow personally but it's perfectly understandable from the team's standpoint, and that's what matters most, he said.</p>
        <p>The cuts left the Islanders with 2 goalies, 13 forwards -- including Taylor Pyatt, a first rounder from 1999 -- and 8 defensemen. The Islanders expect to carry seven defensemen, with either Aris Brimanis or Yevgeny Korolev expected to make the final spot.</p>

        <p>RANGERS 4, BLUE JACKETS 4: Steve Maltais's goal with 27 seconds remaining in regulation gave the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets a 4-4 exhibition tie with the Rangers last night in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Maltais's pass through the crease was inadvertently knocked in by a Rangers defender.</p>
        <p>The Blue Jackets were working with a man advantage, having pulled goaltender Marc Denis off the ice with 90 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>With 3 minutes 10 seconds left in regulation, Mark Messier had given the Rangers a 4-3 lead with his first goal since returning to New York. (AP)</p>
        <p>BRASHEAR DRAWS BLANK: Donald Brashear of the Vancouver Canucks testified yesterday that he does not recall being hit in the head by Marty McSorley's stick or being taken off the ice on a stretcher with a concussion during a game against Boston last Feb. 21.</p>
        <p>''The only thing I remember is jumping on the ice without much time left,'' Brashear said. ''Marty was put on the ice also.''</p>
        <p>McSorley, who has played in the National Hockey League for 17 seasons, could get up to one and a half years in prison if convicted of assault for hitting Brashear over the head with his stick. (AP)</p>
        <p>KOLZIG HAS SURGERY: Capitals goaltender Olaf Kolzig, who won the Vezina Trophy last season, will be sidelined for about three weeks after arthroscopic surgery yesterday on his right knee.</p>
        <p>''This was minor surgery to remove a bone spur and scar tissue,'' General Manager George McPhee said.</p>
        <p>The Capitals open the regular season against Los Angeles at home on Oct. 6. Craig Billington is Kolzig's backup and, unless the team makes a another move, he would probably become the starter. (AP)</p>
