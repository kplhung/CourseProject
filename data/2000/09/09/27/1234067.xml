        <p>Sun Microsystems plans to introduce on Wednesday two computers that are the first of a new generation of systems intended to raise the performance of the high end of Sun's product line.</p>
        <p>The two computers -- a desktop work station and a workgroup server -- will be based on a long-delayed microprocessor, the Ultrasparc III, that Sun said would double the speed of software applications.</p>
        <p>Prices of the two computers will start at $10,000.</p>
        <p>The systems, part of the company's new Net Effect strategy, will operate at speeds of 750 and 900 megahertz and will scale up to 1.5 gigahertz, the company said.</p>
        <p>Sun also plans to introduce software that can tie together computers on a network to increase performance.</p>
        <p>The new machines are 64-bit systems, a design that permits computers to manage vast databases of information easily. Intel is working on its own 64-bit design, known as Itanium, but it will not become available commercially until the first half of next year.</p>
