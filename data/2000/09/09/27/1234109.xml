        <p>THIS is a portrait of the artist as an angry middle-aged man (except when he's laughing at the irony of his predicament).

        <p>THIS is a portrait of the artist as an angry middle-aged man (except when he's laughing at the irony of his predicament). After a career spent scraping by in near-anonymity, he is selected from 400 applicants to design a city monument at Foley Square in Lower Manhattan that pays homage to African-American slaves like his great-great-grandfather, Steve Pace.</p>
        <p>Eight years and two rejections later, he completes his granite masterpiece and trucks it to the city in huge jigsaw pieces from a Quebec quarry. He installs it in mid-winter, decides he loves it, but now finds himself pondering a boycott of its formal unveiling next month.</p>
        <p>Should he grit his teeth and participate, or should he bite the hand that fed him? Patrons aren't easy to find, especially if you're a black artist, he says.</p>
        <p>Lorenzo Pace, 56, never before had a one-man show in Manhattan, much less a signed monument, but is far grayer of beard than he was when his project began. He believes the monument is being given short shrift by politicians and bureaucrats who appear deaf to his protests that the week when Columbus's arrival in the New World is celebrated is not the right time to unveil a work that honors the slaves, immigrants, and Indians who were wronged in this nation's formative years.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to pull out the race card,'' Dr. Pace says. ''I'd like to think it's above that. But I'm a realist. Let's get to the real deal here: this should be a day for healing. We've all got our scars. Racism is a cancer that's eaten away at our society, let's face it. We've got to stop the madness. Maybe it won't happen in my lifetime, but I'd like to see it start happening here. Wow, don't get me going, it's hard to stop.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Pace has taught at the University of Illinois and at Medgar Evers College here and has directed the Montclair State University Art Galleries in New Jersey since 1988.  These days, he visits his shrouded 300-ton sculpture often. It is, after all, a public work for a most public place. It was commissioned for $750,000 and was to be the centerpiece for the $18 million revamping of Foley Square, within a historic district that includes the African Burial Ground, where hundreds of slaves are buried. Dr. Pace took the burial ground as his main muse, although a separate memorial has been commissioned there.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pace's sculpture is to be dedicated on Oct. 12, the traditional date for Columbus Day, although the formal holiday is Oct. 9.</p>
        <p>Its four-story outline stark beneath a green tarpaulin and yards of rope, the piece seems to have received a sneak midnight visit from Christo, the artist with a penchant for wrapping large structures. But it was covered at Dr. Pace's behest, and at an expense of $16,000 for the city.</p>
        <p>It is abstract, a representation, he says, of an antelope mask worn by tribesmen in Mali, Africa, and mounted atop an Indian canoe.</p>
        <p>SO why is the colorfully attired Dr. Pace bouncing around the sculpture's base on a chilly afternoon wearing plastic orange-rimmed glasses, really red suede sneakers and a very blue expression?</p>
        <p>He is agitated because the tarpaulin will come off ''Triumph of the Human Spirit'' on a date he finds offensive.</p>
        <p>And he is agitated because he thinks Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern doesn't like ''Triumph.'' He heard ''through the grapevine'' that he had wanted a globe-like monument to anchor the Foley Square site, which is framed by United States and New York State courthouses and lighted by a bank of spotlights from the top of the Customs Court building.</p>
        <p>''You've got the Tombs, the immigration building, the pillars of the courts, and Wall Street nearby: this is one of the most powerful areas of the city,'' he said. ''So it's ironic that a monument to slaves ends up here. And appropriate. There used to be a gallows here.''</p>
        <p>What's inappropriate? Well, he resents it that Mr. Stern, besides refusing his requests to reschedule the ceremony, has never congratulated him for a 1997 Art Commission award given ''Triumph.''</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Stern says he has bent over backward to accommodate Dr. Pace, and that logistics, not politics or spite, forced him to schedule the unveiling on Oct. 12. It does not conflict with the Columbus Day observances and closings on Oct. 9, he said, and is the first date that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator Daniel P. Moynihan could squeeze into their calendars.</p>
        <p>''Neither the mayor nor the senator believes that Oct. 12th is a day of infamy unsuitable for public ceremonies,'' adds Mr. Stern. About his fondness for the Pace sculpture, he says, ''I'm a groundskeeper, not an art critic. But I rather like the antelope aspect of it.''</p>
        <p>The antelope sculptor was born in Birmingham, Ala., and grew up in Chicago, where his father was a Pentecostal minister, his mother a quilt maker. Dr. Pace says he took up wood carving at 23. A college curator stumbled across one of his masks at a community art fair and encouraged him to attend art school. He received a doctorate in art education from Illinois State University in 1978  and settled into his Williamsburg, Brooklyn, studio 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>Dr. Pace, a father of four -- ''I encouraged them not to become artists, it's too tough of a balancing act'' -- isn't sure how, or if, the dispute over his sculpture will be settled, but he plans to write a book about it.</p>
