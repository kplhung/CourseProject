        <p>Christie's announced yesterday that it had approved a $256 million settlement of civil claims that it, along with its archrival, Sotheby's,  cheated buyers and sellers as far back as 1992. Forty-eight hours earlier, Sotheby's disclosed that its board approved its half of the $512 million settlement.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's former chairman and majority shareholder A. Alfred Taubman is paying $156 million of the auction house's $256 million payment, but Christie's said in a written statement yesterday that it together with its parent company, Christie's International, was coming up with all the money itself.</p>
        <p>While Sotheby's is a publicly traded company, Christie's was taken private two years ago when it was bought by Francois Pinault, the French takeover investor, for $1.2 billion.</p>
        <p>Both auction houses are able to make $50 million of their payments in the form of certificates issued to clients toward future consignments.</p>
        <p>Christie's chief executive, Edward J. Dolman, said the settlement ''will have no impact on our operations,'' yet auction house experts say that the $256 million is bound to affect its financial health. In the three years before it went private, Christie's reported pretax profits of a little more than half of its $256 million payment.</p>
        <p>Andree Corroon, a spokeswoman for Christie's, declined to comment on where the auction house will get its financing.</p>
        <p>The civil class-action lawsuit grew out of a three-year-old federal antitrust investigation into accusations that top officials of the auction houses colluded on an array of business practices including fixing the prices charged to buyers and sellers.</p>
