        <p>EVERY year around this time, the mail brings a raft of notices from California's small exclusive wineries offering their latest vintage. The wines are listed with prices, and an address to which I should send my check.</p>
        <p>There's only one problem: they won't sell me any wine. There are 29 states in which it is illegal to ship wine from another state directly to a consumer. I live in one of them, New Jersey, and work in another, New York.</p>
        <p>These laws are strongly supported by the liquor and wine wholesalers and by most retailers. They are terrified that the Internet, through which most of these direct sales are made, is going to put them out of business. The states support these laws for fear that direct shipping will elude their taxes.</p>
        <p>I might not be so exercised over all this if, with the mails blocked to me, I could slip around to my local wine merchant and buy the wine there.</p>
        <p>But I can't.</p>
        <p>In the last 40 years, the number of liquor wholesalers has shrunk by a staggering 97 percent. And while their numbers have dwindled, the number of wineries has exploded. There are more than 800 in California alone, producing some 4,000 different wines. The wholesalers are more interested in volume than variety, and that leaves most people without access to some of best small producers in the country.</p>
        <p>As a result, hundreds of small wineries, desperate for an outlet, have turned to the Internet and mail order, but they find themselves largely stymied there as well.</p>
        <p>Understandably, the frustrated winemakers and their customers have begun to fight back. And they are finding a sympathetic ear in some courts. In the past year, wineries and consumers have filed lawsuits in six states asserting that to single out wine for special controls is discriminatory, a restraint of trade and a violation of the interstate commerce clause, which grants Congress the exclusive authority to regulate commerce among states.</p>
        <p>In two of the suits, in Indiana and Texas, the plaintiffs won. On Sept. 13, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the Indiana decision, a ruling that a spokeswoman for the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America, Juanita Duggan, called ''a major step forward for the state officials who are trying to prevent  out-of-state alcohol shippers from evading taxes and selling wine, liquor and beer without checking ID's.''</p>
        <p>John DeLuca, the president of the Wine Institute, a trade group that deals with legislation and consumer issues affecting the wine industry, said that the decision seemed to be based mostly on courtroom technicalities. A consumer group, the Informal Coalition to Preserve Consumer Access to Wine, noted that with laws  being challenged in New York, Virginia, Texas, Florida and North Carolina, ''the Seventh Circuit opinion will certainly not be the last word on this issue.''</p>
        <p>A week earlier, the United States District Court in the Southern District of New York denied a motion by the wholesalers' lawyers to dismiss the New York suit. New York liquor laws make it illegal to ship or advertise wine in the state without a license. Out-of-state wineries are ineligible for licenses. In allowing the suit challenging the New York laws to go to trial, Judge Richard Berman cited United States Supreme Court cases that declared states' laws invalid if their purpose was ''mere economic protectionism,'' which of course is the fundamental purpose of the laws being challenged.</p>
        <p>The wholesalers hotly deny this, claiming they are equally concerned about the effects of the under-age drinking that direct shipping would surely encourage. ''The Constitution prevailed over reckless disregard for temperance, tax collection and local custom,'' Ms. Duggan said.</p>
        <p>The United States Senate is expected to consider a new direct shipping bill, probably in the remaining weeks before the end of the current session. Sponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and called the 21st Amendment Enforcement Act, the bill would, in essence, allow the states to get federal help in prosecuting out-of-state wineries that ship wine directly to a wine drinker.</p>
        <p>By itself, the bill probably wouldn't get anywhere. Tacked on to one appropriations bill or another, it will probably pass, but direct shipping advocates say it will have minimal effect on the growing number of suits in the federal courts aimed at overthrowing the states' shipping laws.</p>
        <p>The whole fracas will almost certainly end up in the Supreme Court, not because it's important that some dot-com plutocrat gets his Pahlmeyer Chardonnay from Jason Pahlmeyer himself, but because it affects the future of e-commerce and what many consider outmoded interpretations of the 21st Amendment.</p>
        <p>Back in 1933, the idea behind the 21st was to keep gangsters out of the liquor business. The thugs never did get out; they just went legit, as Damon Runyon would say, and with the people who had been locking them up on their side, they prospered.</p>
        <p>Now, for the first time, the wholesalers face a serious threat. And not just from a passel of wine geeks. The rise of the Internet has created a new dynamic in the business world, one that a group of outmoded monopolists, with a few prohibitionists along for old times' sake, cannot long withstand. Besides, once the wineries agreed to pay state taxes -- which they have -- it was all over but the shouting.</p>
        <p>It may take a while, but one day not too far off, clicking on zinfandel and waiting for the Federal Express delivery will be an essential part of the wine experience.</p>
