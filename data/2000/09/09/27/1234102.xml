        <p>The nation's largest trash disposal company, which made a much-heralded entry into New York City four years ago as part of the Giuliani administration's effort to combat organized crime, is dropping 10 percent of its city customers, saying that hauling trash in parts of Queens, Staten Island and Manhattan is not profitable.</p>
        <p>The move by the company, Waste Management, reflects broader shifts in the city's commercial trash industry, as prices charged to restaurants, stores and office buildings increase and as locally owned, independent trash haulers regain some of the market share lost to national haulers in the last five years, industry analysts said.

        <p>The nation's largest trash disposal company, which made a much-heralded entry into New York City four years ago as part of the Giuliani administration's effort to combat organized crime, is dropping 10 percent of its city customers, saying that hauling trash in parts of Queens, Staten Island and Manhattan is not profitable.</p>
        <p>The move by the company, Waste Management, reflects broader shifts in the city's commercial trash industry, as prices charged to restaurants, stores and office buildings increase and as locally owned, independent trash haulers regain some of the market share lost to national haulers in the last five years, industry analysts said. Most of the city's residential trash is collected by the city.</p>
        <p>Waste Management, which is based in Houston, is notifying 3,300 New York City customers by letter that they have two weeks to find a new hauler, George McGrath, a company spokesman, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The company's action follows a similar decision earlier this year by the nation's 10th-largest hauler, IESI Corporation, of Haltom City, Tex., to discontinue routes on Staten Island and in the Bronx, dropping about 6 percent of its New York City business. Officials from both companies said yesterday that they made the moves for a simple reason.</p>
        <p>''The company has to be able to operate profitably,'' Mr. McGrath said.</p>
        <p>The average price per cubic yard that city businesses pay for trash removal rose by 12 percent in the last year and a half, rising to $7.16, according to the Trade Waste Commission, a city agency established to reduce the influence of organized crime in the trash-hauling industry, in part by encouraging national companies to enter the market.</p>
        <p>Restaurants, office buildings and stores are still paying, on average, far less than the nearly $15 a cubic yard most had been paying before the commission was set up in 1996. But there are signs that Waste Management's move may drive prices even higher.</p>
        <p>James H. Fitzgerald, the president of Envirotron USA, a New York City company that arranges trash contracts for major retailers and restaurants, said yesterday that he had found alternatives at the same price for some clients that had been dropped by Waste Management. But in other cases, he is being asked to pay about 10 percent more.</p>
        <p>Norice Ormsby, the owner of Washington Heights Optical on St. Nicholas Avenue, said she would now pay $40 a month for five-day-a-week pickup, instead of the $22 a month she had paid to Waste Management for two pickups a week.</p>
        <p>''I am not happy,'' Ms. Ormsby said. ''For the amount of trash that I have, I think $40 is a lot.''</p>
        <p>Raymond V. Casey, deputy director of the Trade Waste Commission, said he remained confident that there was more than enough competition in New York City. He noted that about 150 companies were licensed to pick up any kind of commercial waste in the city; about 50 more are allowed to operate while the city continues to investigate whether they have ties to organized crime. He added that there was no sign that widespread corruption was returning to the industry.</p>
        <p>''It is not like in the early 1990's,'' Mr. Casey said, ''when if one hauler said, 'I am not going to take your garbage,' it could mean that it would sit there and rot on the curb.''</p>
        <p>Under city regulations, a trash hauler cannot charge more than  $12.20 per cubic yard, but the city is considering raising that ceiling, which has been in place since 1997, for certain types of waste, he said.</p>
        <p>Waste Management would not specify the areas of Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island where it was discontinuing routes or dropping clients. The routes being dropped are those where the company either does not have a large concentration of customers or is not making money.  The company, which suffered large losses last year after an accounting scandal and management upheaval, is doing better so far this year as it sheds unprofitable business.</p>
        <p>Some industry analysts said major national haulers like Waste Management, in an effort to quickly establish a presence in New York City, were willing to offer extremely low prices when they first arrived. But as the cost of transporting the waste and paying the people who handle it has risen, these large corporations have been less willing to accept marginal returns or losses.</p>
        <p>Waste Management still owns many of the large transfer stations in the city -- where trash is taken before it goes to landfills -- and it has shown no sign that it intends to get out of that business, which is considered more profitable. It is also bidding to handle a large share of the city's residential waste, which will soon be entirely exported after the Fresh Kills landfill, on Staten Island, closes next year.</p>
        <p>John C. Isabella, owner of Isabella Carting of the Bronx, said that even before Waste Management dropped many customers, he had been picking up some of its clients.</p>
        <p>''It is a nice turn of events,'' said Mr. Isabella, whose 73-year-old business, started by his grandfather, now has about 1,050 customers. ''You feel like Goliath has been trying to beat us, and we have survived.''</p>
