        <p>Moving to address safety concerns, agribusiness companies took steps yesterday to limit the chances that a strain of bioengineered corn not approved for human consumption could end up in food products.</p>
        <p>The corn, approved for use only in animal feed, was found last week in a sampling of taco shells sold in stores under the Taco Bell brand, prompting Kraft Foods to recall the more than 2.5 million boxes of the product believed to be in distribution.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Aventis CropScience, which engineered the corn to make it more pest-resistant and marketed the technology under the StarLink name, told seed companies not to sell any of the corn for planting next year.</p>
        <p>Affirming a policy adopted Monday by the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a Washington-based trade group, Aventis also said it would no longer market bioengineered products for any use until they had been cleared for use in food.</p>
        <p>''We agree that it's prudent,'' said David Witherspoon, president of the Garst Seed Company, Aventis's biggest licensee. Mr. Witherspoon said Garst, based in Slater, Iowa, would store StarLink corn seed harvested this year on the assumption that StarLink would eventually be cleared for food use.</p>
        <p>While it has not been established that the StarLink corn poses a risk to human health, tests have found it to carry a protein that has some characteristics of allergens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Witherspoon said Garst would direct farmers who want next year's crops engineered to fend off the corn borer, a common pest, to use corn strains based on Monsanto's YieldGuard technology, which has government clearance for food uses.</p>
        <p>Aventis said yesterday that the company and regulators were discussing the fate of the 315,000 acres planted with StarLink this year. Aventis said it was close to announcing new measures developed in consultation with farmers to confine the current crop to approved uses. Aventis said that containing this year's crop should not be a major challenge since it represented much less than one-half of 1 percent of the 73 million acres planted in corn this year.</p>
        <p>As Aventis moved to halt sales of the corn seed, the company that milled the corn in the taco shells moved yesterday to halt further shipments of yellow corn products from its mill in Plainview, Tex. The company, Azteca Mills of Dallas, said it was testing for evidence of the unapproved corn and expected to resume full production within a week. The Plainview mill has been identified as the source of the corn meal for the Kraft taco shells, which were made at a plant in Mexico owned by PepsiCo.</p>
        <p>Kraft said yesterday that as far as it could determine, all Taco Bell shells were off the shelves. ''We will not destroy the products that are being returned until we hear from the Food and Drug Administration what it wants to do with them,'' said Michael Mudd, a company spokesman.</p>
        <p>The recall will cost Kraft millions of dollars at a minimum, but the final figure, including lost sales, will not be known until Kraft finds a new mill to make the shells and starts producing them again, Mr. Mudd said. In any event, the losses are not expected to hurt the earnings of Philip Morris, Kraft's parent.</p>
        <p>The Taco Bell restaurant chain, meanwhile, said that tests had turned up ''no reason to believe'' that the unapproved corn had found its way into the shells used in its restaurants. Taco Bell's suppliers include the PepsiCo plant in Mexico, although its shells use a different recipe than Kraft's.</p>
        <p>The restaurant chain, a subsidiary of Tricon Global Restaurants in Louisville, Ky., said all shells now being shipped had been made from corn grown in regions other than the Plainview area as an added precaution.</p>
        <p>Biotechnology critics said that even with the corporate steps being taken to deal with the episode, a thorough government investigation was in order.</p>
        <p>''You can't identify a solution until you have a better understanding of the problem,'' said Margaret Mellon, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington.</p>
        <p>The case was mentioned several times yesterday during a Senate committee hearing on biotechnology. Joseph A. Leavitt, director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration, commended Kraft for ''acting responsibly'' in the taco shell recall. He told the committee that the incident reinforced the need for vigilance by federal authorities and ''other interested parties'' to make sure that ''the rules pertaining to bioengineered foods are being fully adhered to.''</p>
        <p>The StarLink corn is a latecomer among the several first-generation biotechnology products that use genes from the Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, family of bacteria, to produce a protein deadly to corn borers. It was approved for use in corn for animal feed or industrial products in 1998.</p>
        <p>The StarLink protein attaches to a different part of the insect gut than those produced by other Bt-engineered plants. Evidence suggesting that it might cause allergies because it is not so easily broken down in the human digestive system led the Environmental Protection Agency to demand more tests before clearing it for use in food corn.</p>
        <p>Identifying which altered corn has the StarLink gene can be tricky. Aventis yesterday endorsed a test developed by Strategic Diagnostics. But even that test cannot pick out processed foods made from StarLink corn because the Bt protein typically is broken down by heating and other food processing.</p>
