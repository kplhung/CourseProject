        <p>Just after tucking away a nervous match point, Venus Williams was trotting around the tennis court with a racket in one hand and an American flag in the other. An ambidextrous celebration for the ubiquitous Williams.</p>
        <p>For an entire summer, she has been everywhere, equally dominant on different continents and under any circumstance. With her 32nd victory in a row, Williams today added a gold medal to the Summer of Venus collection while undoing the Russian Elena Dementieva, 6-2, 6-4, at the Olympic tennis center.</p>
        <p>It was typical Williams. In the fifth game of the second set, Dementieva actually had fate going her way as she smacked a backhand into the tape and watched it flop to Williams's side of the net.</p>
        <p>A cheap point, any point, would have lifted Dementieva's dragging spirits. But appearing out of nowhere, Williams darted from the baseline to within two feet of the net, slipping her racket under the ball like a flapjack cook and flicking it back to her opponent. Stunned by the development, unsure of just what angle to take, Dementieva whacked the ball into the net.</p>
        <p>Williams has become the dream squisher of the women's tour. One after another, opponents have come at Williams with optimism only to leave devastated.</p>
        <p>In a couple of weeks, Williams will gather her back-to-school pencils and notebooks and plop down in a fashion design class. And if a teacher or classmate should ask, ''So, what did you do last summer?'' she can present the show-and-tell of all time.</p>
        <p>Her run of trophies began in July, back when she ended her fortnight at Wimbledon by joyously spinning around the Center Court lawn after her victory while her father flashed a sign from the stands that read: This is Venus's party, no one else is invited.</p>
        <p>The private party continued, spilling over into the United States Open, then crashing in on Sydney. She became the second woman to win those three tournaments; Steffi Graf did it in 1988. Today, Williams was in position to create an opportunity only one other player in tennis history has achieved: play for a gold medal in the singles and doubles. In 1924, Helen Wills won both. On Thursday, Williams will join her sister Serena to play the Dutch pair of Miriam Oremans and Kristie Boogert in the gold medal doubles match.</p>
        <p>This is how the team was supposed to perform. With the exception of Lindsay Davenport -- who had to withdraw from the Olympics because of a foot injury -- the Americans have been as dominant as advertised. Today, Venus Williams stood with the gold and Monica Seles was draped with the bronze. Seles had beaten the 17-year-old Australian Jelena Dokic, 6-1, 6-4, on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Somewhere, doubles player Lisa Raymond might be unimpressed. She was the one left off the blueprint in Billie Jean King's design for the Dream Team of tennis. The Americans were constructed to win. Davenport's injury might have prevented the sweep of their fantasies, but everything else has fallen into place.</p>
        <p>The only one in Venus Williams's way of a big finish to her summer was the unassuming Russian. Dementieva is equally blonde and sleek as the popular Anna Kournikova, but she's the un-Kournikova. At the end of August, she arrived at the United States Open without sponsors, clothing deals or the million-dollar endorsement opportunities heaped on her compatriot.</p>
        <p>Quietly, she separated herself from Kournikova in another way. Before anyone realized it, she had plowed her way through to a Grand Slam semifinal, and gave Davenport a handful before exiting the Open. Unlike Kournikova, her talent turned heads.</p>
        <p>Her arrival in the gold medal match was not surprising. With slashing ground strokes and a solid serve, Dementieva was at least equipped to give Williams a difficult run for her gold.</p>
        <p>But as much as she pummeled the side pockets of the court with her inside-out forehands, as much as she pumped backhands down the line, Dementieva could not faze Williams. When Williams is on the run, able to uncoil her body for maximum power, she is at her best.</p>
        <p>The proof was in the first set. Despite a couple of problems with her serve, Williams turned her opponent's best shots into winners, gradually wearing down Dementieva's confidence before coming away with a 6-2 first-set certification of her dominance. Someday, Dementieva might develop a strategy. Today, she was just another bystander during the Summer of Venus.</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>The men's bronze medal match ended today with some drama. In a tight finish, in which one break of serve was the Holy Grail of the match, the Frenchman ARNAUD DI PASQUALE slipped by Switzerland's ROGER FEDERER, 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7), 6-4.</p>
