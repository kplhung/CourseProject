        <p>Charles Barkley, Dan Marino, Mary Jo Fernandez and Mike Schmidt arrived first, followed by Mario Lemieux, Dick Vermeil and Cale Yarborough. Michael Jordan bypassed the reception in the west foyer of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and went straight to the dais, taking his place among the eight athletes honored last night at the 15th annual Great Sports Legends dinner.</p>
        <p>Barkley went straight to the point when asked about the Knicks' trade of Patrick Ewing to the Seattle SuperSonics last week.</p>
        <p>''I thought they treated Patrick terrible, and I will never respect the Knicks after what they did to Patrick and I wish nothing but bad stuff upon them,'' said Barkley, who retired last season. ''Patrick is a great person, he gave everything he could give to the Knicks and they treated him badly.''</p>
        <p>The dinner, which drew close to 1,100 people, raised an estimated $1 million for the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, which was founded in 1986 by Nick Buoniconti, a former All-Pro linebacker for the Miami Dolphins, to help his son, Marc, and others disabled by spinal cord injuries.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is more aware about these types of injuries now than when I got hurt because of high-profile people like Christopher Reeves and Dennis Byrd suffered spinal cord injuries,'' said Marc Buoniconti, who has been in a wheelchair since being injured at age 19 during a college football game in 1985. ''We want to raise awareness and show people the results being done.''</p>
