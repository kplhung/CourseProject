        <p>In his recent memoir the writer and director Arthur Laurents offers a revealing account of working with Barbra Streisand in 1962 on her breakthrough supporting role in the Harold Rome musical ''I Can Get It For You Wholesale,'' a show about the cutthroat world of the New York garment district during the 1930's. Ms. Streisand, then 19, played Miss Marmelstein, a harried, put-upon 50-ish secretary. Her one solo song, ''Miss Marmelstein,'' was an ambling lament of a feisty spinster who wants to be more than the frumpy nobody that everyone in the office takes for granted.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streisand sang the song sitting in a office chair on wheels, and every night her performance stopped the show. The role led directly to ''Funny Girl,'' the 1964 Jule Styne musical that made her a star.</p>
        <p>But shaping Ms. Streisand's portrayal of Miss Marmelstein was a struggle, writes Mr. Laurents, who made his directorial debut on Broadway with ''Wholesale.'' Everything that has remained phenomenal and exasperating about this now-iconic artist, who is performing sold-out concerts tonight and tomorrow night at Madison Square Garden, was already evident in the work of the fiercely ambitious and audaciously talented 19-year-old.</p>
        <p>''Trying to direct her out of excesses wasn't easy,'' Mr. Laurents writes. ''Her Miss Marmelstein was very funny, a bizarre collection of idiosyncrasies which came from instinct and were probably rehearsed at home. The trouble was overkill: too many twitches and collapses, giggles and gasps, too many take-ums.'' She was an original, Mr. Laurents adds. He didn't want to lose that. ''What I did want was to edit, to cut out the extraneous contortions.''</p>
        <p>Many people who are moved and awed by Ms. Streisand's vocal artistry, myself included, feel the same way.</p>
        <p>Her voice was a phenomenon from the very start. When she was 13, Ms. Streisand and her mother paid a few dollars at a makeshift studio in Brooklyn to record her in two songs, including the Mack Gordon-Harry Warren standard ''You'll Never Know.'' The performance makes clear the extent of her natural gifts.</p>
        <p>Her voice is a little tremulous and unsteady in pitch. She hasn't yet adjusted to singing through a microphone, a technique that would soon become central to her work. But hints of the varied colorings and melting richness of the mature Streisand voice are already there. The performance has a precocious emotional impact. When she sings the phrase ''You went away and my heart went with you,'' could she have been thinking of her father, who died when she was 15 months old?</p>
        <p>The pianist Glenn Gould, a self-confessed ''Streisand freak,'' wrote in a 1976 review of her ''Classical Barbra'' album that, though not devoid of problem areas, ''the Streisand voice is one of the natural wonders of the age, an instrument of infinite diversity and timbral resource.'' With the possible exception of the German soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Gould stated, ''no vocalist has brought me greater pleasure or more insight into the interpreter's art.''</p>
        <p>It's interesting that Gould admired these two particular vocalists. Although one sang with a consummately trained natural voice, and the other is a practitioner of the amplified pop music tradition, they do share qualities, including a tendency to divide listeners right down the middle. Some opera and art song enthusiasts consider Ms. Schwarzkopf the ultimate in exquisite vocal artistry. Others, though acknowledging her lustrous voice, find her singing mannered, calculated and marred by obsessive perfectionism.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Ms. Streisand has fans who think her incomparable, including, no doubt, those who scooped up tickets for the Garden concerts, which cost from $125 to an incredible $2,500 for a gala ticket that includes dinner. But many pop-singer enthusiasts disdain what they consider her mawkish and self-indulgent style.</p>
        <p>And her singing can be fussy. Even Gould conceded that, like Ms. Schwarzkopf, Ms. Streisand is one of the great italicizers: ''No phrase is left solely to its own devices.''</p>
        <p>But at her best, when she tames her talent and sings with directness, bending the daringly slow phrases of ''Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,'' or turning ''Make the Man Love Me'' into an unbearably wistful expression of vulnerability, questions of style and taste disappear in the presence of a disarming voice and interpretive vision.</p>
        <p>The only time in her career that Ms. Streisand erred in the opposite direction by being too cautious was when she recorded the ''Classical Barbra'' album in 1976. This program of slow, dreamy songs by Debussy, Wolf, Faure, Handel and others, performed in subdued orchestral arrangements, is fatally reverential. Though she is striving for what she thinks is classical purity, Ms. Streisand's singing is pale and faceless. There is more classical purity in her meltingly lyrical version of ''The Boy Next Door'' on her ''Simply Streisand'' album from the early years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streisand may have lost an important artistic mooring when she grew quickly frustrated with the Broadway musical heritage that had nurtured her in order to roam stylistically all over the place, dabbling uncertainly in country, rock, even disco. Mr. Laurents writes that during the run of ''Wholesale'' it was already clear that Ms. Streisand intended to be a star, ''a movie star,'' he emphasizes; ''the theater was merely en route -- she had not a doubt in the world about that.''</p>
        <p>That may have been a mistake. Working within traditions can helpfully rein in artists, especially those with oversize talents. Judy Garland arguably did the greatest work of her life when she was making movie musicals under the wings of strong directors. Even Frank Sinatra's most lasting work may have come during the early decades when he was being challenged by film directors, songwriters and bandleaders who understood both the range of his talent and his wildness.</p>
        <p>The release of Ms. Streisand's ''Broadway Album'' in 1985 was touted as her return to her roots, her coming home. It cheered those of us who regretted that she had left home in the first place. Even on this impressive record there were the inevitable lapses, like the hokey arrangement of ''Somewhere'' from ''West Side Story,'' turned into intergalactic New Age music, with Ms. Streisand's voice processed through an electronic echo chamber and backed by the synthesized sounds of celestial choirs.</p>
        <p>But several of the selections are exquisitely performed. She brings a rich variety of hues and wistful inflections to ''Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man'' from ''Show Boat,'' yet makes it sound utterly natural, as if she's simply talking to us. Running through the orchestration by Peter Matz is a poignant harmonica descant played by Stevie Wonder, no less.</p>
        <p>Her performances of several Stephen Sondheim songs are revelations. The general take on Mr. Sondheim's songs is that they so integrally emerge from the shows they were conceived for that it is hard to perform them out of context. Applying the full force of her dramatic sense and personality, Ms. Streisand lifts them out of context and makes us consider them anew.</p>
        <p>Her idea of letting ''Pretty Women'' from ''Sweeney Todd'' segue into ''The Ladies Who Lunch'' from ''Company'' is a bit heavy-handed, but she brings it off. She uncovers a sweetness in ''Pretty Women,'' which is so leering and dangerous in the show, and finds a sadness in ''The Ladies Who Lunch,'' which is so famously bitter.</p>
        <p>In ''Putting It Together'' from Mr. Sondheim's ''Sunday in the Park With George,'' Ms. Streisand not-so-gently mocks her own obsessiveness as a director and producer while proving again what a master of the patter song she is. And her comforting account of ''Not While I'm Around'' from ''Sweeney Todd'' leaves you thinking that when Mr. Sondheim wrote the song in 1979, he was somehow anticipating the impact that AIDS would later have on his and Ms. Streisand's circle of loved ones, as well as their legions of fans. ''Demons are prowling everywhere/Nowadays,'' she sings pointedly; ''I'll send 'em howling/I don't care, I got ways.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sondheim was so taken with the ''Broadway Album'' project that at Ms. Streisand's request he added lyrics to ''Send in the Clowns'' so she could repeat the bridge one more time. Hearing her sing the song, you wonder why he didn't just write a whole show for Barbra Streisand.</p>
        <p>It wouldn't have worked then, and still wouldn't. First of all there is the matter of amplification. In the golden days, Broadway divas like Ethel Merman didn't need it. Today's great musical theater artists, like Bernadette Peters, have accommodated themselves to body microphones, which have become, to my lasting dismay, requisite on Broadway.</p>
        <p>But you can't imagine Ms. Streisand performing with a body microphone stuck in her hair. She is an artist of the hand-held microphone, working in the long tradition of pop singers like Bing Crosby and jazz singers like Betty Carter. The microphone is an essential part of Ms. Streisand's technique. She wields it with a sophistication that enables her to make Madison Square Garden seem as intimate as Bon Soir, the Greenwich Village nightclub she sang in during the early 1960's for $125 a week.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, more savvy than we imagine, Ms. Streisand anticipated even then the sorry turn that the American musical would take during the course of her career. But if she had remained involved, perhaps she could have helped prevent the demise.</p>
        <p>For better or worse, by the time of ''The Broadway Album'' she had gotten too big for any mere musical. No show could contain her. And yet a little containment would have been a good thing. In any event, the record offered a enticing glimpse of what might have been.</p>
        <p>The buzz is that this concert tour will be Ms. Streisand's last. That buzz has been heard before. But she is 58; maybe this time it could be so. Though she never announces beforehand what she will sing, it's safe to say that her program may resemble her new two-disc album, ''Timeless'' (Columbia), which captures her live in concert last New Year's Eve at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. Many cuts on the new discs are refreshingly straightforward, like the lovely versions of ''Alfie,'' ''A Sleepin' Bee'' and ''Evergreen.''</p>
        <p>But style-blurring excesses will likely remain part of Ms. Streisand's work. Fans have long learned to accept her on her own terms. She is like a best friend who drives you crazy with her hang-ups and habits but makes you laugh with her self-deprecating humor, keeps you going with her mix of pluck and vulnerability, and is always there.</p>
