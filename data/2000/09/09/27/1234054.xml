        <p>BEFORE Congress adjourns next month it may vote on a bill that would prohibit state and local governments from passing food safety laws that are tougher than federal laws, as well as void any such laws that already exist. The food industry has tried since 1986 to persuade Congress to pass this legislation, and this year it may succeed through legislative maneuvering.</p>
        <p>The industry wants federal and local laws to be uniform because, it says, conflicting laws confuse consumers. Yet, 16 state attorneys general who oppose the bill insist, with other opponents, that the regulation of health and safety has historically been left to the states.</p>
        <p>The proposed legislation, called the national uniformity for food bill, would void laws like a New Jersey prohibition on the sale of the herbal supplement ephedra to anyone under 17. About a dozen other states and local jurisdictions also have laws governing the sale of ephedra, a stimulant that the Food and Drug Administration says has been responsible for at least 17 deaths, many among young people.</p>
        <p>But as a result of pressure from the dietary supplement industry, the federal government has no law banning the sale of ephedra to young people. In fact, the federal government barely regulates dietary supplements. In July the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said consumers may be buying potentially unsafe ingredients because the Food and Drug Administration has never issued safety standards for dietary supplements. A law passed by Congress in 1994 prevents it from doing so.</p>
        <p>If the current bill is passed it would also pre-empt states from passing any other food safety measures under consideration, like requiring the labeling of genetically modified foods, because the federal government does not believe such labeling is necessary. The recall last week of Kraft Taco Bell taco shells made with genetically modified corn not approved for human consumption has heightened interest in such labeling.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the new legislation say it would also void a New York State law requiring frozen food previously offered as fresh to be so labeled, as well as other local laws requiring warnings about the safe storage of eggs in the shell and the proper handling of smoked fish and raw shellfish. Proponents say that warning labels on raw shellfish would be exempt, but the bill's wording is unclear. The bill would allow states to petition the Food and Drug Administration to allow exemptions.</p>
        <p>Most important, the bill would void California's Proposition 65, passed in 1986, which requires warning labels on products containing ingredients that may cause cancer or birth defects. In two instances companies chose not to sell foods in California because they would have had to carry warnings. Proposition 65 was instrumental in forcing manufacturers to change their products to avoid the labels: taking lead-soldered food cans off the market, for example, as well as removing lead in dishware and drastically reducing the amount of lead in calcium supplements and antacids.</p>
        <p>The Grocery Manufacturers Association, which is leading the fight for the new bill, acknowledged that Proposition 65 had not resulted in label changes for any food sold in California. But Brian Folkerts, vice president of government affairs for the National Food Processors Association, said that ''if one state imposed a warning requirement not adopted by other states, there is pretty clear linkage that could lead to considerable confusion.'' Consumers might question the safety of certain products, Mr. Folkerts said.</p>
        <p>In addition to the 16 state attorneys general (including those of New York and Connecticut, but not of New Jersey), others strongly opposed to this legislation include the Association of Food and Drug Officials, made up of state and federal officials; the Consumer Federation of America; and the Center for Science in the Public Interest.</p>
        <p>Similar bills had never been voted out of committee before, but this year's was approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee without any hearings. Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, has blocked it from a vote by the full Senate, but its sponsors are trying to attach it as a rider to an appropriations bill, and it could pass unnoticed in the last weeks of Congress, when so much legislation is pushed through.</p>
        <p>David Roe, a senior attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund, describes the efforts to attach the bill as a rider as ''a nasty little sneak attack.'' The bill's sponsors, he said, ''managed to get it through without one single hearing.''</p>
        <p>He contends that ''it would muzzle all the states in advance forever.''</p>
        <p>The Food and Drug Administration acknowledges that it does not have the ability to deal with all food safety issues, but it has not taken a position on the bill.</p>
