        <p>NBC and baseball are parting ways. The network told officials of Major League Baseball yesterday that it would not agree to pay at least double its current $80 million-a-year rights fee, ceding all the broadcast rights to Fox.</p>
        <p>''We have informed Major League Baseball that we have passed on their offer,'' Ken Schanzer, the president of NBC Sports, said.</p>
        <p>NBC will end its association with baseball with the American League Championship Series next month.</p>
        <p>A news conference to announce the Fox deal is expected today, television executives said. They also said that ESPN rejected a demand to renew its division series rights, which will be part of the Fox contract. ESPN was being asked to more than double its fee of about $6 million a game for about six division series broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Fox has made a six-year, $2.5 billion offer to own all the national broadcast rights and retain its Fox Sports Net and Fx cable rights. For the last five years, it has paid $575 million to carry the Saturday Game of the Week, alternated All-Star Games and World Series with NBC, showed one league championship series while NBC showed the other, and televised divisional series games.</p>
        <p>Fox will now take NBC's All-Star Game and postseason rights plus ESPN's divisional series rights.</p>
        <p>Divisional series games have never thrilled the networks, because their ratings are low.</p>
        <p>Baseball had originally sought a tripling of Fox's payments to retain what it had, largely to mimic ESPN's new six-year, regular-season $810 million contract.</p>
        <p>By making its new deal, Fox is guaranteeing highly rated World Series every season for six years -- although the event's rating are in a downward trend -- along with lower-rated League Championship Series games.</p>
        <p>The added games will fill Fox's October programming schedule but will also force it to sell considerably more commercial inventory. And as the network with the weakest ratings, Fox will be faced with stiff counterprogramming from its three major rivals; when NBC was splitting the rights, it did not diminish the value of baseball by putting its best shows against the World Series.</p>
        <p>This is NBC's second leave-taking from baseball in the past 10 years. CBS paid $1.06 billion for all the broadcast rights commencing from 1990 to 1993. The deal lost an estimated $500 million for the network.</p>
        <p>NBC returned in 1994 in a revenue-sharing partnership called the Baseball Network with ABC and Major League Baseball. It provided baseball with no cash up front, and the partnership then unraveled because the players' strike eliminated revenues from the 1994 postseason.</p>
        <p>NBC and ABC left acrimoniously, charging that baseball had dealt unfairly with them.</p>
        <p>NBC vowed not to make a deal with baseball again until the 21st century. But four months after the divorce, NBC made the five-year, $400 million deal that will conclude with its A.L.C.S. telecasts.</p>
