        <p>Jerry Claiborne, who turned out good teams but even better classroom stars in 28 years as the head football coach at Virginia Tech, Maryland and Kentucky, died Sunday at a hospital in Nashville. He was 72.</p>
        <p>The cause was a heart attack after complications from two abdominal operations last week, his son Jonathan said.</p>
        <p>Claiborne was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame on Aug. 11 but was too ill to attend the dinner in New York.</p>
        <p>Claiborne was the head coach for 10 years at Virginia Tech (1961-70), 10 years at Maryland (1972-81) and 8 years at Kentucky (1982-89). When he retired with a record of 179-122-8, he ranked fourth in victories among active major college coaches, trailing only Bo Schembechler of Michigan (234), Joe Paterno of Penn State (219) and Bobby Bowden of Florida State (193). He took 11 teams to postseason bowl games.</p>
        <p>Four of his players were Academic All-Americans and 87 made the Southeastern Conference all-academic team. In his last season, Kentucky won the College Football Association's Academic Achievement Award as the major team with the highest graduation rate, 90 percent.</p>
        <p>As John Clay wrote in The Lexington Herald-Leader: ''He was just an old-fashioned coach with old-fashioned values who had the one thing a lot of coaches and administrators preach, but too few actually have. He had integrity.''</p>
        <p>Joe Prince, who played for Claiborne at Maryland from 1983 to 1986,  said: ''He had his morals and his goals set in stone, and he never bent for them. He had a strong faith. He didn't drink. He didn't cuss.''</p>
        <p>When Claiborne retired, William F. Reed wrote in Sports Illustrated: ''He wasn't glib like Lou Holtz or slick like Barry Switzer or a constant contender for the national championship like his mentor, Bear Bryant, but he loved football with all his heart. He loved the contact on the field and the challenge of beating the other guy both physically and mentally.''</p>
        <p>Jerry David Claiborne was born Aug. 26, 1928, in Hopkinsville, Ky., the eighth of nine children. He earned high school letters in football, basketball, tennis and track, then went on to Kentucky, where he played end, blocking back and defensive back under the legendary Bryant.</p>
        <p>In 1950, he earned a degree in mathematics and physical education with high distinction. Then he coached football for two years at a military school and nine years (eight under Bryant) as an assistant at Kentucky, Texas A&amp;M, Missouri and Alabama.</p>
        <p>His prowess, especially on defense, earned him head-coaching jobs, but conditions were never ideal. Virginia Tech was then a small college playing big teams. He recalled that at Maryland, ''We didn't even have a room big enough for a team meeting, and we had to lift weights outside because there wasn't enough room inside anywhere.'' At Kentucky, where he inherited a program in turmoil, basketball was king.</p>
        <p>Several football players had been arrested on various charges. The team was under National Collegiate Athletic Association probation for recruiting violations. Discipline and academic concerns were paltry. And the team had gone through four consecutive losing seasons.</p>
        <p>His first Kentucky team did not win a game, losing 10 and tying one.  His next went 6-4-1 and played in the Hall of Fame Bowl.</p>
        <p>''I want to be remembered as a guy who did the best he could with what he had, and that we tried to run a program that was within the rules,'' Claiborne once said. ''Our rules were that if that rule didn't make the kid a better person, a better student and a better athlete, then we'd throw out the rule.''</p>
        <p>After the 1989 season, at age 61, he retired, saying his heart was no longer in the game. His wife, the former Faye Hooks, whom he married in 1951, said later that she thought Alzheimer's disease was the reason.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife; two sons, David of San Francisco and Jonathan of Baltimore; two daughters, Katie Newell of Landenberg, Pa., and Eileen Claiborne of Portland, Ore.; four grandchildren; two step-grandchildren; and five siblings.</p>
        <p>''He was tough, but he was fair,'' his wife said, ''and his players loved him for that.''</p>
        <p>And his son Jonathan once said:  ''He's somebody who really practices the American ethic, that if you work hard, good things will come to you. He did that, and he did it his way.''</p>
