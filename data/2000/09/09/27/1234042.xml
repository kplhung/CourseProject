        <p>TO most outsiders, the southeastern coast of New England is a stretch of tranquil countryside, a blur of old stone fences and shady country roads on the way to Cape Cod. A place where ospreys nest along the tidal Westport River, and where black and white cows graze in pastures all the way down to the shoreline.</p>
        <p>But the region is also blessed with the longest growing season in all of New England and a sunny temperate climate like that of northern France. And like that part of France, it is the source for oysters so fine they are sold by name, and wines that are served in some of the leading restaurants in Boston and New York. One of the best American blue cheeses is made here, not far from centuries-old apple orchards and farms that are experimenting with cutting-edge technology in fish farming.</p>

        <p>TO most outsiders, the southeastern coast of New England is a stretch of tranquil countryside, a blur of old stone fences and shady country roads on the way to Cape Cod. A place where ospreys nest along the tidal Westport River, and where black and white cows graze in pastures all the way down to the shoreline.</p>
        <p>But the region is also blessed with the longest growing season in all of New England and a sunny temperate climate like that of northern France. And like that part of France, it is the source for oysters so fine they are sold by name, and wines that are served in some of the leading restaurants in Boston and New York. One of the best American blue cheeses is made here, not far from centuries-old apple orchards and farms that are experimenting with cutting-edge technology in fish farming.</p>
        <p>All of the region's exceptional bounty is the result of hand labor on the kind of small farms that were on the verge of disappearing just a few years ago. Like other small farms around the country, they are being rescued by agricultural artisans who have learned to offer the quality that satisfies a more appreciative and sophisticated America.</p>
        <p>In Westport, there is a plan that is beyond ambitious: to preserve the rural coastline and make the region as famous for its food and wine as Sonoma County in California or the Hudson Valley in New York State.</p>
        <p>A group of preservationists has named the region the Heritage Farm Coast, a designation that includes Westport, Dartmouth, Fairhaven and Marion in Massachusetts, and Tiverton and Little Compton in Rhode Island. The center of the revitalization efforts is Westport, still the most rural of all the towns along the coast and ripe for overdevelopment. Until the end of World War II, Westport was a thriving farming and fishing community and the bread basket for New Bedford and Fall River, large towns that have themselves fallen on hard times.</p>
        <p>Right now, the big question for the area is ''how to promote our uniqueness, the fishing, farming, food and wine,'' said Bob Russell, who with his wife, Carol, is the de facto leader of the preservation movement. Their winery, Westport Rivers, sits on land that has been farmed since 1652. The Russells started the winery in 1982. They bought a nearby farm five years ago, to prevent it from becoming a housing development. Now, it is the site of their latest effort, Buzzards Bay Brewery.</p>
        <p>The Russells' vineyard is one of three in the area, the best known being Sakonnet Vineyards, which was started in 1975 in Little Compton. Situated on one of the most beautifully manicured vineyards in the United States -- the land around the vineyards could be croquet courts -- its wines are served at places like Mesa Grill in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''It's a great food wine,'' Mollie Battenhouse, the general manager of Best Cellars in Manhattan, said of Sakonnet's Vidal Blanc. ''It's crisp with a high acid content and a little residual sugar.''</p>
        <p>Sparkling wines from Westport Rivers vineyards have been getting high marks and some visibility at the White House, and even on the television series ''West Wing.'' They will be on the menu of Olives, the restaurant that Todd English is opening in New York this fall.</p>
        <p>Beyond wines, the Farm Coast produces a dream list of high-quality ingredients, but most of what is grown here never leaves home. Marketing has always been the biggest stumbling block for farmers, but those who have learned that it is essential are making a living. A few, like Tim and Tina Stone of Great Hill Dairy, are doing very well.</p>
        <p>The Stones couldn't earn a living as dairy farmers, so they looked for something more, what is called in business a value-added product.</p>
        <p>''We got into cheese because we couldn't make it otherwise,'' said Mr. Stone, a tall, lanky man, who leases his land, part of 500 magnificent acres on the shore of Buzzards Bay in Marion once owned by his great-grandfather. ''When our two sons were born, we knew we wanted to find another way to stay here and live on a farm.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stone gave up a career as an engineer to make Great Hill Blue, a fine aged blue cheese with a full, mellow flavor and a national reputation. ''The Marion General Store was the first place that bought our cheese,'' he said. ''I peddled it myself.''</p>
        <p>Now, it has a following that includes Kevin Tyldesley, who chooses the cheeses for Gramercy Tavern in Manhattan. ''This is a lot more subtle than Roquefort,'' he said, ''but it's not a dumbed down cheese. It's very complex.''</p>
        <p>In 1993, the Stones sold 12,000 pounds of the rich raw milk cheese; they expect to top 52,000 pounds this year.</p>
        <p>Eva Sommaripa, a former potter, is considered the most successful farmer in the area -- even though she tills all of two acres. Her amazingly fragrant herbs are cut to order for some of Boston's top chefs.</p>
        <p>Her business, Eva's Garden, has been growing organic herbs for more than 20 years in Dartmouth, including basil that you cannot resist the temptation to pluck and rub between your fingers. Not content to grow the ordinary, Ms. Sommaripa has recently leased some additional land to experiment with growing herbs in high shade in the forest.</p>
        <p>''A lot of chefs have our name on their menus, so a lot of people come to visit,'' Ms. Sommaripa said. ''There is a basic satisfaction feeling connected to the earth and the source of your sustenance.''</p>
        <p>Chris Schlesinger, a chef and an occasional contributor to the Dining Section, is one of the few local representatives of the restaurant side of the farm-chef equation. His Westport restaurant, the Back Eddy, features local ingredients. ''Right now, there are just baby steps between chefs and growers,'' he said. ''Other than Eva's Garden, no growers are being asked to grow for chefs, but we are starting and that's the break. That's the critical mass.''</p>
        <p>Early on, Coll Walker, whose roadside stand in Little Compton has been a fixture for 30 years, realized he would not survive selling wholesale. ''I saw retail as the only way to go,'' he said. ''Rather than being at the mercy of the middleman, we really stress quality.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the sparkling fresh greens and corn whose silks are still damp, Mr. Walker sells his own fruit preserves, honeys and relishes. He has shared his roadside space with a popular coffee shop and bakery, Olga's Cup and Saucer, for 13 years.</p>
        <p>The aromas drifting from the shop draw people who might not even have been thinking about a half-dozen ears of corn for that night's dinner. With open fields across the road and the Sakonnet River just down the hill behind the stand, it's the perfect spot to linger over a cup of espresso and a warm croissant.</p>
        <p>At Noquochoke Orchards, Sue and George Smith and their four children raise 95 varieties of heirloom apples with names like Rhode Island greenings, Baldwins, Northern Spy and Winesaps, as well as other fruits and vegetables. They also have a roadside stand, which is often untended and on the honor system.</p>
        <p>Their 79-acre farm runs down to the water's edge and has been in the family since 1899. Even though developers offered them $1.5 million for the land, Mrs. Smith couldn't bear to see it turned into house lots. ''George's father and mother worked too hard for that,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As we toured the orchards, with old trees that require ladders for picking, dwarf trees that can be picked from the ground, and the latest, trees trellised like grapevines, Mrs. Smith was eager to talk about her efforts to reduce the use of pesticides by spraying only when necessary. Her husband says he likes it because it's cheaper.</p>
        <p>Some people, eager to stay in the region and farm, have gone down more unusual paths.</p>
        <p>On his farm, Jim Munger is growing hydroponic tomatoes and raising striped bass; the water in which the fish swim is filtered and mixed with other nutrients and then fed to the tomatoes. ''Farming is in my blood,'' said Mr. Munger, who is a retired teacher. ''So, as soon as I was able, I bought a farm and taught chemistry. I combined my vocation and avocation and brought my students out here to teach them environmental science.''</p>
        <p>The striped bass effort is still just beginning. ''I'm sure you can make a living at this,'' he said, ''but it has to be on a large scale.''</p>
        <p>At 10 one perfect sunny morning, Jimmy Wood was dumping bushel after bushel of just-picked corn onto tables at his vegetable stand in Westport. Even though there are two other vegetable stands close by, Mr. Wood managed to increase his business 25 percent this summer. The trick was simple enough, paving over a patch of land to make a parking lot. He paid for it with a grant of $20,000 that Massachusetts provides to farmers who guarantee they will stay in business for a certain number of years. Next year, he's adding a cooler to keep the produce fresher and an ice cream stand.</p>
        <p>''You can make a good living,'' said Mr. Wood, whose wife, Joan, manages the stand during the summer. ''But to run a very successful stand is more demanding than anyone can imagine. It's 10 to 12 hours a day, seven days a week.''</p>
        <p>Westport once had more dairy farms than any other town in the state. Today, there are only 12 left. Dairy farmers all over New England have fallen on hard times, and even though those in Westport get very little money for their milk, most of them are reluctant to start making ice cream or yogurt or cheese. These are the farmers most tempted to sell their land to developers -- especially when they are offered millions of dollars an acre for waterfront property.</p>
        <p>Westport was also once an important fishing port, but overfishing of the Westport River and the bay took a drastic toll. Seth Garfield, who has summered on Cuttyhunk Island for all but 3 of his 43 years, has been leasing a 30-acre saltwater pond there since 1981, and raising oysters from seed. We met on a dock, at the end of the day. Sun- and wind-burned, in the fashion of people who are outside all day, Mr. Garfield said his least favorite time of the day is the three hours when he makes his rounds seeing his customers. He'd rather be with his oysters.</p>
        <p>''When I started it, no one was doing it,'' he said. Even with competition, he says, he could sell four times as many oysters as he raises. In the summer, his company delivers oysters, clams and cooked shrimp directly to boats from his floating raw bar.</p>
        <p>A part-time school teacher, he is taking a sabbatical this year to concentrate on his oyster business. Active in the Coalition for Buzzards Bay, he is one of the people trying to reduce the pollution from the runoff of the farms, a problem that sometimes puts farmers and fishermen at odds.</p>
        <p>Oysters from his Cuttyhunk Shellfish Farms are highly prized and are on the menu at the Oyster Bar in Grand Central, among many other East Coast restaurants. Sandy Ingber, the executive chef at the Oyster Bar, said he had been buying them for many years. ''They have a nice crisp briny flavor,'' he said, ''and I have people coming in asking for them.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone wants to save the coastal area by making it a culinary destination. There is a strong anti-regulatory streak in New Englanders, as in ''You can't tell me what to do with my land,'' and many zoning boards are more than happy to let the developers put up cheek-by-jowl houses. Preservation efforts by the state and private organizations are working hard to keep that from happening. But turning the Heritage Farm Coast into Sonoma East would certainly be a big help.</p>
        <p>Though Westport's population of 13,000 increases by several thousand during the summer, when vacationers come to kayak and fish, there are only two restaurants in town that use local ingredients. Accommodations are limited to a chain motel and a small bed and breakfast without private baths. At every level the Heritage Farm Coast idea is in its infancy, and it's far too soon to tell whether the effort will succeed.</p>
        <p>''Nothing happens fast in agriculture,'' Bob Russell said. ''I'm very  cautious about saying we have been successful. But we are not, yet, losing farms.''</p>
