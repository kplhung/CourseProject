        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>NEW BRUNSWICK: GUN LOCKS OFFERED  St. Peter's University Hospital distributed 300 gun-trigger locks yesterday in four hours and 15 minutes. As in other hospitals that have distributed the free locks as a gun-safety measure, officials did not ask for identification or ask questions that might discourage gun owners. ''Some people took two or three,'' said Gary Cooper, a hospital spokesman.</p>

        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: BAIL DENIED IN BOMB CASE  An Orlando, Fla., man who prosecutors say is a member of an organization led by the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden was refused bail yesterday after a federal judge in Manhattan concluded he might flee before his trial. The defendant, Ihab M. Ali, was recently charged with perjury and criminal contempt for refusing to testify before a grand jury investigating the bombings of two United States embassies in Africa in 1998. Mr. Ali was jailed for 16 months after being found in civil contempt for refusing, on religious grounds, to testify.</p>

She succeeds Daniel Silverman, who as director for 19 years was involved in widely publicized labor disputes, including the major league baseball strike.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: COLOMBIAN EXTRADITED  A man has been extradited from Colombia and accused of the murder of Donald E. Pagani Sr., a retired New York City police detective. The United State's attorney's office said yesterday that the man, Nelson Baez, is believed to be a member of the Restrepo Organization, a Colombian gang that robbed many criminal and legitimate businesses, including drug dealers and jewelers. The killing of Mr. Pagani occurred during an August 1999 armed robbery of a meat company in the Bronx.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: MORE CUNY FUNDS SOUGHT  As the jockeying begins over next year's state budget, Carl Hayden, left, chancellor of the State Board of Regents, is arguing that Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani should direct more money to CUNY. In a recent speech at Queensborough Community College, Mr. Hayden said that CUNY's new master plan would cost ''money the city and state are honor bound to provide.'' He added, ''CUNY desperately needs more full-time faculty, more technology, more access programs and better facilities.''</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: GUILTY PLEA IN FRAUD CASE  A Memphis man pleaded guilty yesterday to a multicount indictment that included conspiracy and credit card fraud, the United States attorney's office said. Prosecutors said that the man, James Rinaldo Jackson, used bank and credit card data to buy merchandise worth more than $730,000. Prosecutors said his victims included top officials at Wendy's International, Coca-Cola Enterprises and Lehman Brothers.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: TWO CHARGED IN METS INCIDENT  Brian C. Peterson, who made headlines as a teenager when he and his high school sweetheart, Amy S. Grossberg, were convicted of manslaughter after their newborn son was found discarded in a motel trash bin, was arrested at Shea Stadium last night and charged with obstruction. Mr. Peterson, 22, of Wyckoff, N.J., interfered with officers who were trying to arrest a friend of his for throwing a bottle at John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves pitcher, during the Mets game, said Officer Cheryl Cox, a police spokeswoman. The friend, Raymond Maniaci, 22, also of Wyckoff, was charged with reckless endangerment, Officer Cox said. Mr. Peterson was released from prison in January after serving 18 months of a two-year sentence for his role in the infant's death in 1996. Andy Newman (NYT)</p>
        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: TRIBE MAY ADD LAND  A three-judge federal appeals court has upheld the federal government's 1995 decision to allow the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in eastern Connecticut to expand its reservation. In its ruling, announced yesterday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overturned a 1998 ruling in which a federal judge ruled that the tribe could not annex land outside its reservation's boundaries. The dispute centers on 165 acres the Pequots bought, adjacent to its reservation and its Foxwoods Resort Casino. Including that land in the reservation would exempt it from state and local taxes, zoning restrictions and other state jurisdiction. The Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said an appeal was very likely.</p>
