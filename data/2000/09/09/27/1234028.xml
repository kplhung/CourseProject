        <p>For five rounds of diving, Xiong Ni had watched Dmitri Sautin whirl through the air in tightly wrapped spins and somersaults, building a lead that neither Xiong nor Sautin's 10 other rivals appeared ready to match. Xiong had come out of retirement specifically to help the Chinese team counter Sautin's pre-eminence, and now he was waiting and hoping for the Russian to give him an opening in the 3-meter springboard final.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Xiong, Sautin saved his hardest dive, but not his best one, for last. His slip-up enabled Xiong to surpass him and claim the gold at the Olympic Park Aquatic Center tonight. Sautin dropped to third behind Mexico's Fernando Platas, who finished just 0.3 points behind Xiong.</p>

        <p>For five rounds of diving, Xiong Ni had watched Dmitri Sautin whirl through the air in tightly wrapped spins and somersaults, building a lead that neither Xiong nor Sautin's 10 other rivals appeared ready to match. Xiong had come out of retirement specifically to help the Chinese team counter Sautin's pre-eminence, and now he was waiting and hoping for the Russian to give him an opening in the 3-meter springboard final.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Xiong, Sautin saved his hardest dive, but not his best one, for last. His slip-up enabled Xiong to surpass him and claim the gold at the Olympic Park Aquatic Center tonight. Sautin dropped to third behind Mexico's Fernando Platas, who finished just 0.3 points behind Xiong.</p>
        <p>Xiong, 26, became only the second diver to win medals at four Olympics -- Italy's Klaus Dibiasi was the other, from 1964 through 1976 -- and he repeated his springboard victory from the 1996 Atlanta Games. Xiong's victory today also made him only the second man, after Greg Louganis, to repeat as Olympic springboard champion. Xiong also won a bronze in the platform in 1992 and a silver in the platform in 1988.</p>
        <p>''Only when the points came up did I believe that I was the champion,'' said Xiong, who came out of retirement two years ago at the urging of Chinese sports officials. ''This is the best, most valuable reward for the hard work and sweat of the last few years.''</p>
        <p>Two American divers, Troy Dumais and Mark Ruiz, finished sixth and seventh, respectively. Dumais lost his chance when he gambled and changed his third dive, increasing the degree of difficulty from 3.0 to 3.5. His form was off, and he was effectively eliminated with a low score of 49.50. Ruiz, whose specialty is the platform, was never in serious contention in the final round.</p>
        <p>Xiong was more than 30 points behind Sautin after two rounds, and the way Sautin was diving there seemed little chance that Xiong would catch him. Platas was staying close with a series of somersaults in the pike position, but Xiong moved past him into second on the fifth dive with a beautiful reverse 1 1/2 somersault with 3 1/2 twists. With one dive to go, Sautin led Xiong by just under 11 points, and Platas by just over 13 points.</p>
        <p>Platas, Sautin and Xiong were the final three divers, and the Mexican turned in his best dive of the night. Sautin faced his toughest dive, a reverse 2 1/2 somersault with 1 1/2 twists, and failed to execute it. He received his lowest score of the night, and fell below Platas.</p>
        <p>Xiong finally had his opening, and he seized it. Knowing he was 81.30 points behind Platas, he executed a near-perfect inward 3 1/2 somersault and watched as the scoreboard registered marks of 7.5 to 8.0 for an 81.60. Xiong pumped his fists and joyfully hugged his coaches.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Sautin acknowledged that he might have erred in putting his most difficult dive at the end. ''I led from the beginning to the final dive,'' Sautin said afterward, ''so it is very disappointing to lose. My last dive is the most difficult in my program, so maybe it was a mistake to include it.''</p>
