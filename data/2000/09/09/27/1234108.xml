        <p>The Census Bureau reported today that median household income topped $40,000 for the first time last year and that the percentage of households living in poverty dropped to the lowest point in more than two decades. It was the fifth straight increase in median income, the first time that has happened since the bureau started keeping track of household incomes since 1967.</p>
        <p>In its annual reports on income and poverty, the bureau noted that median household income rose by 2.7 percent in 1999, to $40,816, from $39,744 the prior year. It reported that 11.8 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 1999, down from 12.7 percent the year before. The poverty rate in 1999 was defined as a household income of $17,029 for a family of four.</p>
        <p>Over the long term, the bureau's reports describe an economy that is merely returning the country to where it was at the beginning of the 1990's. But they also present a vivid picture of sharp gains that occurred last year as the economic recovery reached further down the income scale. For example:</p>
        <p>*Median income for African-American ($27,910), Hispanic ($30,735), as well as non-Hispanic white ($44,366) households reached the highest levels ever recorded.</p>
        <p>*Households in the bottom fifth of the income scale saw their household earnings rise by 5.4 percent, the largest of any quintile.</p>
        <p>*The number of people living in extreme poverty, defined as having incomes that are less than 50 percent of the official poverty line, dropped to 4.6 percent of the population, from 5.1 percent.</p>
        <p>*More than 80 percent of the 2.2 million households that moved above the poverty line in 1999 lived in the inner cities.</p>
        <p>*While seven states -- Arizona, Arkansas, California, New York, South Dakota, Utah and Virginia -- and the District of Columbia saw their overall poverty rates decrease, no state saw a statistically significant rise in poverty.</p>
        <p>''What's so striking about these numbers is that it shows that the economic progress is not just restricted to Silicon Valley or to the stock market,'' said Martin Bailey, chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, after reviewing the census data.</p>
        <p>Still, 1999 was only the second year in a row that median income topped  the $38,837 level of 1989.</p>
        <p>Released six weeks before the election, the eagerly awaited report often provides fodder for political campaigns. The Clinton administration and Vice President Al Gore's campaign immediately claimed credit for the robust results.</p>
        <p>''This certainly shows that progress has been made over the last eight years,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman. ''But the central question of this campaign is how we build on our prosperity to make new progress and to benefit everyone, not just a few.''</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas also sought to take credit for the economic progress in his state during the past few years, pointing out that Texas' two-year average median income rose 3.5 percent, higher than the 3.1 percent increase for the country as a whole.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign attributed the growth in income to policies he pushed as governor, like the ''two biggest tax cuts in Texas history.''</p>
        <p>The average two-year median income did rise faster than the national rate and more than several states, including Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana. But Texas' income growth was less than that of states like Arkansas, Rhode Island and New York, and the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>There were, however, some downturns in the Census Bureau's upbeat news. For the second year in a row,  the earnings gap between men and women increased. Median income for women who work full time, year-round, fell slightly to $26,324 from $26,433, while median income for men working full time rose to $36,376 from $36,126.</p>
        <p>Median household income is the level at which half the 120 million households in the country bring in more money and half bring in less. It is considered a more accurate measure than average household income, which can be skewed by a relatively few super wealthy families.</p>
        <p>In addition, for the sixth year in a row, the gap between the rich and the middle class and the poor did not change, and there is a dispute among economists as to whether it may have increased.</p>
        <p>The bureau's calculations of income do not take into consideration some government benefits like the earned-income tax credit, which has directed billions of dollars of cash assistance to poor people who work. Census officials say factoring in the tax credit would cause a closing of the income gap between the rich and the poor.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the bureau does not factor in capital gains earnings on the sale of stocks or property when calculating income figures. Since the information on income is gathered from telephone interviews, census officials say people are generally not asked about their capital gains income, since most people do not have that information at their fingertips.</p>
        <p>Some economists say including capital gains income would greatly widen the income gap between the affluent and the poor. They note that the Internal Revenue Service reports that capital gains income rose to $427 billion in 1998 from $163 billion in 1993, and that the great bulk of those earnings went to tax filers with incomes over $200,000.</p>
        <p>''One begins to worry that inequality has stabilized at a historically high level,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization. ''I don't see any good reason in an economy as strong as ours, at this point in the business cycle, that we don't seem to be nudging income inequality down.''</p>
