        <p>If you thought yuppie arrogance and entitlement had been satirized to death, you  haven't met Hamilton and Meg Swan (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey), the  hysterically doting dog owners who have the funniest scenes in Christopher Guest's dog-show mockumentary, ''Best in Show.'' When we first meet these monsters, both lawyers from Illinois who cooingly recall first locking eyes from behind the windows of adjacent Starbucks coffee shops, they are in the middle of a tense therapy session.</p>
        <p>After they complain to the therapist that their child's jealousy has ruined their sex life, the camera pulls away to reveal the offending brat, none other than their moody, overprivileged pooch, Beatrice, a pure-bred Weimaraner. Sprawled languorously on a couch, wearing an expression of utter disdain, Beatrice momentarily turns her head toward the camera, then looks away in abject disgust.</p>
        <p>As we quickly discover, the Swans are the sort of pet owners who throw tantrums and threaten lawsuits in airports when someone stoops to pet their precious but extremely hostile animal. They also scream at the help in stores that don't happen to carry exact replicas of their little darling's favorite squeaky toy. And when these rage-oholics have no one left to terrorize, they savagely turn on each other. Before the movie is over, Beatrice aggressively asserts her independence at the Mayflower Kennel Club Dog Show, the  canine pageant that draws the film's major characters and their prized pets to Philadelphia. It is a most satisfying comeuppance.</p>
        <p>''Best in Show'' reunites many of the same brilliant comic actors who appeared in Mr. Guest's last movie, the cult comedy classic ''Waiting for Guffman.'' In its hip, condescending way, the new movie is every bit as funny as the earlier film, which painted an amusing but patronizing portrait of a Missouri town staging a tacky historical pageant with Broadway pretensions. As before, the actors improvising from a bare-bones  screenplay (by Mr. Guest and Eugene Levy) riff off one another like jazz musicians to create what may be the cleverest on-the-spot caricatures since the heyday of Mike Nichols and Elaine May.</p>
        <p>The Swans are nearly matched in nasty hilarity by Gerry and Cookie Fleck (Mr. Levy and Catherine O'Hara), a milquetoasty men's wear salesman who was literally born with two left feet, and his hotblooded wife, a woman with a checkered past. At every turn, the Flecks keep running into Cookie's ex-lovers, none of whom she recalls but who to Gerry's excruciating chagrin remember her all too well and excitedly begin recalling their encounters in clinical detail. Arriving in Philadelphia with their Norwich terrier Winky, Gerry and Cookie, who have driven all the way from Fern City, Fla., discover at the hotel desk that their credit cards are invalid and are ceremoniously ushered to a utility closet.</p>
        <p>From New York City come Scott Donlan (John Michael Higgins), a flouncing gay dog breeder with a sartorial weakness for ruffles, and his more sedate older partner, Stefan Vanderhoof (Michael McKean), with their prized Shih Tzu, Miss Agnes (after Agnes Moorhead). Next, in descending order of humor, are Leslie Ward Cabot (Patrick Cranshaw), a doddering-unto-death millionaire and his buxom trophy wife (Sherri  Ann Cabot), and Christy Cummings (Jane Lynch), the upwardly mobile lesbian trainer of the May-December couple's standard poodle, Rhapsody in White.</p>
        <p>Finally, we have Harlan Pepper (Mr. Guest), the owner of a fly-fishing shop in Pine Nut, N.C., and his beloved bloodhound, Hubert. Harlan is an aspiring ventriloquist who, when not practicing with a dummy, gets into the heads of his dogs and starts talking for them. The role is a huge and successful stretch for Mr. Guest, whose last screen character,  Corky St. Clair, a gushy, petulant small-town theater director (and exile from Off Off Broadway) supplied ''Waiting for Guffman's'' biggest laughs.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Guest's brand of comedy has been called ''deadpan,'' it was only the first of his three movies, the rock spoof ''This Is Spinal Tap,'' that kept its tongue firmly in its cheek. ''Best in Show,'' like ''Waiting for Guffman,'' is a subtly smirking gallery of caricatures, most of whom don't seem to belong to a particular region or class.</p>
        <p>The humor of Mr. Guest and his cast emanates from the post-collegiate baby boomer belief in an elite ''hipoisie'' who, unlike everyone else, know what's cool and what's not. And dog show habitues, small-town Midwestern chamber of commerce boosters and even successful second-level rock groups are definitely not cool.</p>
        <p>The movie's weaknesses are inextricable from its form. For ''Best in Show'' is essentially a well-organized, exquisitely nuanced skit comedy, ''Saturday Night Live''-style  sketches loosely stitched together and refined to the nth degree. Although the movie pretends to have narrative structure, it doesn't really go much of anywhere. It is futile to  look for deeper patterns in this kind of storytelling. The whole point is to savor the moments. This comic jigsaw puzzle is crammed with deliriously funny little bits.</p>
        <p>My favorite joke is the running commentary by two antagonistic television announcers, a reserved, erudite Englishman named Trevor Beckwith (Jim Piddock) who is well versed in dog show protocol and his loutish know-nothing partner, Buck Laughlin (Fred Willard), who finds a smutty innuendo in every dog-show maneuver. Buck reaches a height of flailing yahooism in a garbled monologue that imagines the Mayflower piloted by Christopher Columbus landing at Plymouth Rock in 1492. Or something like that. When ''Best in Show'' focuses on a character like Buck, its aim is deadly.</p>
        <p>''Best in Show'' is rated PG-13  (Parents strongly cautioned). The screenplay is loaded with off-color humor and sexual innuendo.</p>
        <p>BEST IN SHOW</p>
