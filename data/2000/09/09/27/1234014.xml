        <p>Re ''Sue, but Don't Prosecute,'' by Dick Thornburgh (Op-Ed, Sept. 20):  An important factor in the deterrence of corporate misconduct is the stigma of criminal conviction. Corporate violations have for too long been treated as civil wrongs, where a fine is considered the equivalent of a tax on misconduct. And with ''tort reform in states like Texas, an increasingly inconsequential ''tax'' is threatened -- a slap on the wrist.</p>
        <p>If ever the fear of criminal stigma and the threat of imprisonment were deterrents to wrongful conduct, it would be in the case of white-collar crime, which is injurious behavior committed by people of high social status in the rational pursuit of maximizing profit.</p>
