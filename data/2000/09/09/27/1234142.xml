        <p>The sharpest and most detailed pictures ever made of the surging gases above the sun's surface, captured by a NASA satellite, may reveal the source of one of astronomy's most enduring mysteries: what makes the sun's extended atmosphere, or corona, hundreds of times hotter than its surface, the only apparent source of heat?</p>
        <p>The pictures suggest that the corona's energy may emanate from spectacular pillars of fiery gas near the sun's surface, at the bottoms of looping arches of magnetic fields -- like those produced by a bar magnet, only larger -- that stretch for hundreds of thousands of miles above the surface. Hot gases then seem to explode upward along the magnetic fields and heat the rest of the corona.</p>
        <p>The images from the satellite, called Trace, for Transition Region and Coronal Explorer, were presented by NASA's administrator, Daniel S. Goldin, during a news conference yesterday at the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. An analysis will also appear in the October 10 issue of the Astrophysical Journal in a paper by Dr. Markus J. Aschwanden, Dr. Richard W. Nightingale and Dr. David Alexander, astronomers at the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldin said the new pictures brought astronomers closer than ever to solving a mystery that has baffled them since they first determined the corona's temperature more than half a century ago.</p>
        <p>''We're finding that the heating is going in right at the base of these arcs,'' Mr. Goldin said.</p>
        <p>The new information, Dr. Aschwanden said, seemed to rebut theories that had predicted that the loops were heated uniformly along their length, like toaster wires, by electrical currents or waves traveling along the magnetic fields.</p>
        <p>''We have now the location,'' Dr. Aschwanden said. ''It's like if you have a forest fire -- if you don't know where the fire started, you don't know how it happened.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Spiros Antiochos, an astrophysicist at the Naval Research Laboratory, said he hoped the Trace images would break ''a logjam in understanding what is going on.''</p>
        <p>The sun is powered by nuclear reactions in its core and has a surface temperature of about 6,000 degrees. Unlike Earth's atmosphere, which cools with height, the solar corona's temperature is at least a million degrees. It is normally invisible, but appears as a shimmering halo during solar eclipses.</p>
        <p>Astronomers have long suspected that the magnetic fields above the sun's surface are somehow involved in the heating. The magnetic fields are generated by churning electrified gases deep beneath the surface. Those fields bob through the surface and form vast arches.</p>
        <p>The bottoms, or ''footpoints'' of those arches continue to be shuffled about by gases at the surface. Dr. Antiochos said the solar bonfires might be sparked by violent interactions between magnetic loops as the footpoints crashed together. He said finer observations would be needed to be certain that such interactions were setting off the fiery pillars.</p>
