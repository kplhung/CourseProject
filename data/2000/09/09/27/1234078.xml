        <p>The Ford Motor Company told its tire suppliers a decade ago not to conduct without Ford's approval a driving test of the rollover tendencies of sport utility vehicles and other light trucks, an internal Ford document shows.</p>
        <p>The document is of interest because most of the 101 deaths blamed on Firestone tires in complaints to regulators have occurred in Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles that flipped over when a tire failed.</p>
        <p>There is considerable disagreement between Ford and its critics over how the document should be interpreted.</p>
        <p>Steven M. Pavsner, a personal injury lawyer in Greenbelt, Md., who obtained the document in litigation, contended that it showed that Ford was trying to limit research into rollovers. ''They don't want a written trail,'' he said, adding that he planned to distribute copies of the document to lawyers suing Ford in Explorer cases.</p>
        <p>But Donald F. Tandy, a former Ford engineer who wrote the document, said that the company was conducting driving tests at the time as part of the development of a computer model to predict vehicles' susceptibility to roll over. Ford and its tire suppliers were using the computer model, and Ford had made a decision that it would conduct at its test track in Arizona all of the real-world tests needed to make the computer model representative of reality, Mr. Tandy said.</p>
        <p>''We said we were in charge of validating the model,'' said Mr. Tandy, who worked for Ford as a ''vehicle dynamics'' engineer until 1995, when he joined an engineering consulting firm in Houston that does a lot of work for Ford and other automakers. Mr. Tandy discussed the document at Ford's request.</p>
        <p>The document, dated Sept. 6, 1990, also says that Ford instructed tire makers to provide its officials with oral, not written, summaries of the results of computer simulations. The statement is likely to interest Congressional investigators, who have been upset that Ford has not produced the results from Explorer tire tests conducted in 1989.</p>
        <p>Clarence Ditlow, the executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based advocacy group that works closely with personal-injury lawyers, asserted that the reference to oral summaries showed that Ford was trying to conceal information. ''It's showing that you need to hide the results of the test,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tandy denied this. Engineers for tire makers were just learning to use the computer model then and were producing sometimes wildly different results from day to day and then writing elaborate reports based on inaccurate data, he said. Ford asked the tire makers' officials to discuss their results first because this was simpler and because it did not want to spend years explaining every test result during lawsuits, which has happened anyway, Mr. Tandy said.</p>
        <p>''The summary reports would be inaccurate because they'd do something wrong,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Susan Krusel, a Ford spokeswoman, said that Ford was still looking for the tire test results requested by Congress and believed that the results would confirm an affidavit by a Ford engineer last week that all of the tests were done properly and did not show a problem. ''We have a vested interest in finding this document because it confirms'' the affidavit, she said.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Tandy, the document was also initialed by James Avouris, another Ford engineer who produced the affidavit last week that the Explorer had been tested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pavsner obtained the document when he sued Ford unsuccessfully this summer in the case of a Ford Aerostar van that rolled over when it was hit by a larger van.</p>
        <p>Officials of Bridgestone/Firestone, a unit of the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, have complained in Congressional testimony that the tire maker had not fully understood how the stability of sport utility vehicles differed from cars, and had missed the significance of tire failures on Explorers as a result. Federal data shows that most tire-related deaths in Explorers and other sport utility vehicles occur because of rollovers.</p>
        <p>The Ford directive that barred driving tests of rollovers by tire suppliers was quite explicit. ''No testing by a tire supplier in the near or limit condition for J-turn is to be conducted w.o. Ford supervisory approval as well as having Ford personnel at the site,'' it said, using a common abbreviation for the word ''without.'' In a J-turn test, the vehicle is driven at fairly high speed, typically 55 miles per hour, and then turned sharply, inscribing the letter ''J,'' as viewed from above.</p>
        <p>The test is one of the less stringent ones to find a vehicle's tendency to flip. Independent experts, including federal regulators, have begun using a so-called fish-hook turn, in which a driver does a J-turn and then turns back suddenly in the opposite direction from the semi-circle. The fish-hook turn simulates what might happen if a driver exits a highway on a curved ramp and comes around the ramp at fairly high speed only to swerve to avoid backed-up traffic.</p>
