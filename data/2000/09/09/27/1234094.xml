        <p>As Panamanians denounced the arrival of Peru's disgraced intelligence chief to seek asylum, a prosecutor announced in Peru today that she was closing the bribery case against him.</p>
        <p>The intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, was seen on videotape apparently handing $15,000 to an opposition member of Congress, presumably to win his support. News reports from Lima said the prosecutor's decision, subject to review by superiors, was made on the grounds that there was no official misconduct because the congressman had not yet been sworn into office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos, who had been a close adviser to President Alberto K. Fujimori, arrived here early Sunday and has been given a 90-day tourist visa as officials review his asylum request. He is said to be staying in the home of the Peruvian consul.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how the prosecutor's decision will affect his asylum claim. It was not unexpected among political experts in Lima, who had said Mr. Montesinos is the master of too many secrets that touch Peru's highest levels of political and military power. Many opposition politicians, who had accused him of murder, torture and human rights violations, had made his arrest and trial a nonnegotiable step toward any dialogue on Mr. Fujimori's call for elections next year, a contest in which he will apparently not run.</p>
        <p>''This will only create more of a crisis,'' said Fernando Llovera, a spokesman for Alejandro Toledo, who made a strong showing against Mr. Fujimori in the first round of the recent presidential election, before contending that the vote was fixed and dropping out of the race. ''There are now several groups who will no longer take part in any dialogue.''</p>
        <p>Several opposition legislators arrived here on Monday to ask President Mireya E. Moscoso to deny asylum on the grounds that Mr. Montesinos was fleeing criminal judgment, not political persecution.</p>
        <p>Panamanian human rights groups held a modest protest today on the same street where in 1979 they denounced the shah of Iran's asylum request. The demonstrators said they wanted to show their opposition to Mr. Montesinos's presence and their country's reputation as a haven for political pariahs.</p>
        <p>The government today expelled seven Peruvians who arrived here soon after Mr. Montesinos, including high-ranking military officers who are his allies.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Panama has been the home in exile to, among others, the shah, Gen. Raoul Cedras of Haiti and a former Guatemalan president, Jorge Serrano Elias.</p>
        <p>''The feeling I have is the same as 21 years ago, that of indignation and impotence,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a political expert who said the police nearly beat him to death in the protests against the shah. ''Once again, Panama has been used as a garbage dump and latrine for this type of rat. The truth is that Panama is business, not a country. These people come here with money to do business.''</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman said his office was reviewing the asylum request, which he said was political because of Mr. Montesinos's role as an adviser and intelligence chief. Mr. Aleman acknowledged that the decision to admit Mr. Montesinos was made only after United States officials and numerous Latin American presidents had called Ms. Moscoso to warn her that it was the only way to avoid a bloody coup in Peru.</p>
        <p>''This was a sacrifice by the Panamanian people to help the Peruvian people attain an open democracy,'' Mr. Aleman said. ''So it fell to us to receive Mr. Montesinos. We are a political party that was itself persecuted by the army. It was hard for us to make this decision. But we did it for a brother country.''</p>
        <p>Ricardo Arias Calderon, a vice president in the 90's, said other countries had more resources and room for Mr. Montesinos. ''Why haven't the Latin American presidents explained why they were so eager for Panama to accept him?'' he asked. ''We no longer wish to be the little country where they send dictators.''</p>
        <p>Some political experts said that Panama might have been hoping to get off an American blacklist for not having done enough to fight money laundering.</p>
        <p>''This was a matter of hemispheric cooperation to promote democracy in keeping with international accords,'' Mr. Aleman said. ''I hope that is valued in some way. But there was no quid pro quo.''</p>
        <p>Panama's sometimes troubling role as a haven may bring unwanted costs, said Robert A. Pastor, a political scientist at Emory University and a former member of the National Security Council.</p>
        <p>''Panama has made its own democratic transition, and it is moving to consolidate the rule of law,'' Mr. Pastor said. ''So to excuse somebody who may have committed crimes in another country does not do much to consolidate the rule of law in a hemispheric context.''</p>
