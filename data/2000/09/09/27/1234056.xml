        <p>Matt Lindland's circuitous route to the Olympic wrestling mat took him from the trials to the rulings of arbitrators and into federal courtrooms. Back and forth the tussle went over whether he or Keith Sieracki would be placed on the United States Greco-Roman team. One day, Sieracki was the 167 1/2-pound representative. The next, it was Lindland.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the balding and goateed Lindland was the one to come to Sydney, and Sieracki stayed home in Colorado. As if to justify the wisdom of the federal judges who backed him, Lindland rolled through his class, defeating Georgian, Algerian and Ukrainian opponents to reach tonight's gold medal match against Mourat Kardanov of Russia.</p>
        <p>But Lindland's best maneuvers seemed to be left for his legal fight and his 76-kilogram bouts here before he met Kardanov, who won the gold with a 3-0 shutout. In the bronze medal match, Marko Yli-Hannuksela of Finland beat David Manukyan of Ukraine.</p>
        <p>The American Garrett Lowney took a surprise bronze medal in the 97-kilogram (214-pound) class, defeating Thanos Konstantinos of Greece, 3-1. Sweden's Mikael Ljungberg, a two-time world champion who beat Lowney in the semifinals, won by 2-1 over Davyd Saldadze of Ukraine for the gold.</p>
        <p>''We knew we had a lot of talent and a lot of good shots at medaling,'' Lowney said. ''The people who didn't think we had a chance just weren't following Greco-Roman.''</p>
        <p>Kardanov dominated Lindland early, scoring a 1-point takedown and a 2-point gut wrench in the first period. Then Kardanov totally contained Lindland. They grasped at each other's heads and shoulders, but Lindland rarely put himself in scoring position.</p>
        <p>Late in the second period, Lindland was poised to turn Kardanov but failed to score.</p>
        <p>''The key was who got on top early and got their turns when we were dry,'' Lindland said afterward. ''The second period got slippery'' with perspiration.</p>
        <p>He added: ''He didn't want me to turn him. He was defending, and it was wet out there.''</p>
        <p>Through an interpreter, Kardanov said: ''I was told he would be tough to the last second and I based my defense on that. My main task was to win this with my technique.''</p>
        <p>In Greco-Roman, no holds can be made below the hips, and the use of legs is prohibited except for support.</p>
        <p>Lindland's resemblance to the actor John Malkovich is uncanny, as is his brooding demeanor and unshakable confidence in his talent. ''I got here because I'm a better wrestler than Keith is,'' he said of Sieracki, his silver medal dangling from his neck.</p>
        <p>At no time in his legal quest to make the Olympic team, he said, did he expect to lose. ''It was well worth it because I was always planning to wrestle in this tournament,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lindland lost to Sieracki, 2-1, in the Olympic trials in June, but protested that Sieracki had illegally tripped him. The United States wrestling federation twice rejected his appeal, but an arbitrator ordered a rematch, which Lindland won, 8-0. Sieracki appealed to a second arbitrator, contending that he was not invited to the first arbitration; this time, Sieracki's original victory was upheld.</p>
        <p>But the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit eventually forced the United States Olympic Committee, which was backing Sieracki, to name Lindland to the team.</p>
        <p>''If all that put pressure on me, hopefully it helped my performance,'' Lindland said. ''If there isn't enough pressure, it doesn't seem important.'' Regarding his relationship with the Olympic committee, he added, ''I'm sorry I had to get on the team this way, but I think the best guy got on the team.''</p>
        <p>And, to Sieracki, he said, ''Good luck and God bless.''</p>
        <p>Another American, Rulon Gardner, is still alive in the 130-kilogram (286-pound) superheavyweight division. But the unquestioned favorite on Wednesday is Aleksandr Karelin, the three-time Olympic champion and member of the Russian Parliament, who has never lost in international competition.</p>
        <p>Also in contention for a medal on Wednesday is the American Jim Gruenwald in the 58-kilogram (127 1/2-pound) class.</p>
        <p>In the medal ceremony for the 54-kilogram (119-pound) class, the gold medalist, Sim Kwon Ho of South Korea, stood beside the bronze medalist, Kang Yong Gyun of North Korea.</p>
        <p>The two nations, technically at war, are joined as one team in the Olympics, and marched together in the opening ceremony. Sim said he got tips from the North Korean wrestlers about Lazaro Rivas, of Cuba, in their gold medal match.</p>
        <p>''They told me the Cuban is pretty good and to be careful,'' he said through an interpreter. ''When athletes play and practice together, this is expected.''</p>
