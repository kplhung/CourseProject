        <p>It should come as no surprise that Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde rather uncharacteristically spoke out about his benching by Coach Al Groh in the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Because for months now, rather quietly, the relationship between the two men has become quite chilly.</p>
        <p>Groh and Testaverde did not hit it off right from the beginning, several Jets players said, and they have grown further apart.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons has nothing to do with Groh. Testaverde was close to Bill Parcells and remains so. Testaverde always respected how Parcells treated veteran players by not abusing their bodies with tough, physical practices.</p>
        <p>And that is where the tensions between Groh and Testaverde have their origin, the players said. Groh's training camp practices were brutal and Testaverde went to Groh early in the summer, suggesting that he ease up. The practices remained extremely physical.</p>
        <p>At about the same time, some players went to Parcells to complain about Groh's practices. Parcells stayed out of the dispute, players said, because Parcells felt it would be unfair to Groh to intervene.</p>
        <p>Testaverde is among the veterans who believe Groh was running difficult practices so he could establish himself as a tough coach, several Jets said. Perhaps Groh was trying to grab the attention of the players away from Parcells, they said.</p>
        <p>Whatever Groh's intentions, those harsh training camps seem to be paying off. The Jets have been a tremendous fourth-quarter team this year.</p>
        <p>Testaverde, who has struggled early in games this season, ranks second in the National Football League with a 122.7 rating in the fourth quarter. The Jets' late comeback against the Buccaneers on Sunday marked only the second time in 30 years that a team has won a game after trailing by at least 10 points with less than two minutes remaining. John Elway did it against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1992.</p>
        <p>At the same time, ignoring players can be dangerous. When Dick Vermeil coached the St. Louis Rams, some veteran players complained about harsh practices. Vermeil changed his ways, and in doing so unified the team.</p>
        <p>Although the Jets are 4-0 and have completed only a quarter of their regular-season schedule, Testaverde has already been taking heat from the fans and the news media for his overall play, which has been poor at times.</p>
        <p>Coming off an Achilles' tendon injury and the departure of Keyshawn Johnson, a top wide receiver, Testaverde has a 49.7 completion percentage and a dismal 64.7 quarterback rating.</p>
        <p>What irks Testaverde is that he believes he is getting the blame for much of the Jets' offensive woes when some of the problems are not his fault, Jets players said. Testaverde also wishes that Groh would publicly back him.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Testaverde said of his one-series benching: ''I just kept saying to myself, he's making a big mistake taking me out. Because I really believe the fourth quarter belongs to me.''</p>
        <p>Some Jets said that sometimes the coaching staff had made mistakes by putting the wrong personnel on the field in certain situations. Wide receivers have sometimes run the wrong routes. But most of the blame for the offense's struggles goes to Testaverde. The quarterback believes he is being hung out to dry by Groh, the players said, when Groh could make it clear that Testaverde is often not to blame.</p>
        <p>The players said, for example, that wide receivers had run poor routes several times in the Tampa Bay game. But most fans would not know that the receivers were to blame when Testaverde lofted an errant pass. They would assume that the bad pass was the quarterback's fault.</p>
        <p>When he played for six years in Tampa Bay at the beginning of his professional career, Testaverde thought he was often blamed for mistakes that were not his doing. He did not discuss this in public. But he intends to make his feelings known now, several Jets said, which explains why he spoke up after Groh benched him for a series against the Buccaneers. Make no mistake about it: Testaverde wanted to do well in front of the Buccaneers fans, in a stadium where he had often been booed.</p>
        <p>Testaverde's main beef with Groh? Testaverde wants everyone to be accountable.</p>
        <p>One of the reasons Groh wanted to trade wide receiver Johnson was that Groh feared the kind of public display that Testaverde put on this week. But if what Jets players say is true, then Testaverde has a right to be upset.</p>
        <p>What is needed now is one of those smart-mouthed Parcells tirades. There were times when reporters would ask Parcells questions about a struggling player, and Parcells would get nasty with the reporters in support of the player. Those eruptions were sometimes contrived, but they worked, because the player felt Parcells was backing him up in public. The tensions between Groh and Testaverde do not seem to have reached a critical point. There will likely be a meeting between the two men soon to work out their differences. If the team keeps winning, Testaverde's remarks will be forgotten.</p>
        <p>Still, a reconciliation is needed. The Jets are 4-0 for the first time in their history. The Jets have a bye this week, and after they play Pittsburgh next week, they will probably be 5-0. Things are going too well for Testaverde and Groh not to patch up their differences. They need each other. ''We need to get some things resolved,'' Testaverde said this week of the entire team. ''I'd like to share some of these things with you, but it's probably better that I don't.''</p>
        <p>Just share them with the man who matters: the head coach.</p>
