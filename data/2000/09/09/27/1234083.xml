        <p>A spinal cord injury is especially cruel. It imprisons a person inside his own, immobile body. The sentence might be temporary or it might be for life. When the victim is a young athlete, his paralysis mocks the fit physique and well-toned muscles that lie so still in a hospital bed.</p>
        <p>These are the grim circumstances facing Adam Taliaferro, an 18-year-old Penn State football player who was hurt Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, while trying to make a tackle against Ohio State. His spinal cord was bruised, not severed, and surgery to fuse the vertebrae on Monday was successful. The Penn State doctor said it was too early to tell if he will walk again. It might be a year before they know for sure.</p>

        <p>A spinal cord injury is especially cruel. It imprisons a person inside his own, immobile body. The sentence might be temporary or it might be for life. When the victim is a young athlete, his paralysis mocks the fit physique and well-toned muscles that lie so still in a hospital bed.</p>
        <p>These are the grim circumstances facing Adam Taliaferro, an 18-year-old Penn State football player who was hurt Saturday in Columbus, Ohio, while trying to make a tackle against Ohio State. His spinal cord was bruised, not severed, and surgery to fuse the vertebrae on Monday was successful. The Penn State doctor said it was too early to tell if he will walk again. It might be a year before they know for sure.</p>
        <p>So far, Taliaferro has some movement in his arms, but none in his legs. He can feel sensation in his fingers and toes and all over his body. This is said to be a good sign. But when Dr. Wayne Sebastianelli of Penn State discussed the injury in a conference call yesterday with eloquent and occasionally poignant candor, anyone listening could feel the sickening sense of dread that the athlete, his family and all those close to the team are feeling.</p>
        <p>''He has good times and bad times,'' Sebastianelli said of Taliaferro, a freshman. ''You can imagine. He's an 18-year-old kid. He doesn't know what life's going to bring the next hour, never mind day. From a scientific point of view, I look at it one way. From a Christian point of view, I want the best for the kid. I wish we can turn back the clock. We don't have that opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Taliaferro, a defensive back, was injured with 99 seconds remaining in a 45-6 defeat that left the Nittany Lions at 1-4, their worst start in Joe Paterno's 35 seasons as head coach. Just when Penn State fans were wondering what else could go wrong, something went horribly wrong.</p>
        <p>As Taliaferro tried to make the tackle, his head made contact with the runner's legs and his head and neck twisted grotesquely and unnaturally as he crumpled to the turf. His father was watching on television, at home in Voorhees, N.J., near Philadelphia. Both parents, Andre and Addie, were in Columbus for the surgery Monday and hope to take their son home for rehabilitation in the Philadelphia area.</p>
        <p>''His dad's a rock,'' Sebastianelli said. ''He is so proud that his son is a Penn State football player. And, in the worst way, he wants him to get back to school. He knows he can't play. But he just want him to be a Penn State person.'' In a statement released by the athletic department, Andre Taliaferro said: ''This has been a trying time for our family. But we feel that Adam is on the road to recovery.''</p>
        <p>The team, reeling from a season-long tailspin, is struggling to cope. Paterno, tears in his eyes, canceled Monday's practice and addressed the players. He spoke to them of his son, David, who suffered a fractured skull and went into a coma after a trampoline accident in 1977. David Paterno recovered and lives a normal life.</p>
        <p>The players have planned a prayer service for their teammate on campus for Friday at noon. Shamar Finney, a linebacker, said yesterday: ''We need more prayers for Adam. The more prayers we have, the better his chances of walking out that tunnel again.''</p>
        <p>Referring to Paterno, Finney said: ''He has taken this to heart. I could feel coach's burdens. I could feel his heart. He shed a few tears. I think the players can feel the pain he was enduring.''</p>
        <p>Paterno on Tuesday called the injury ''the worst experience I've ever been involved in'' and said ''I have great empathy'' for the parents.</p>
        <p>Sebastianelli said he and Adam's father have discussed all scenarios, from worst-case to best: ''What if Adam doesn't recover? What if Adam can't walk? What if Adam doesn't get his hand function?'' They have discussed how the family will have to remodel the doors of the home and the bathroom and drive a different vehicle to accommodate their son.</p>
        <p>There is the possibility of experimental treatments, he said, including electrode implants and potential nerve transfers. They may or may not be necessary, the doctor said. ''We really want to get him into a spine program that has those lofty dreams and potential interventions available,'' he said. Most of all, they want to get him close to home, so family and friends can visit.</p>
        <p>''He's so far away from home,'' Sebastianelli said. ''And having people who you care about not being able to hold your hand or support you when you are really struggling. It would be good for Adam to see a lot of his friends from high school.''</p>
        <p>Referring to the Penn State players and those around the team, Sebastianelli said: ''We're all hurting. We're all very emotional about it. We're all very angry about what happened. Why did it happen to Adam?'' The team must play Purdue on Saturday, at home, with the vigor necessary for a dangerous game that sometimes, paradoxically, incorporates a high-speed collision as a means of self-defense.</p>
        <p>''The game is played with aggression,'' the doctor said. ''The game is played with a violence that has to be there. Otherwise, you will get hurt.'' As for tackling technique, Sebastianelli mentioned that players sometimes allow their heads to be the point of contact.</p>
        <p>''Keep your head up,'' he said, referring to tackling technique. ''If you look at the tape, you will understand what I mean. You have to have what you are hitting be visible to you.'' In conclusion, addressing reporters in his audience in State College, Pa., as well as those on telephone hookups, Sebastianelli said:</p>
        <p>''I make a plea: remember, this is someone's kid. I'm a parent. I know exactly what they're going through. This is the one phone call you never want to get. He's got parents and friends who can't see him yet. And they are very, very concerned. He's in the middle of a deep forest right now. But he's got a plan. He's got a compass in his hand. And we're trying to get him through it.''</p>
