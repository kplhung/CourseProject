        <p>Nielsen Media Research is reprocessing NBC's Olympic ratings since Friday night to reflect when the broadcasts started compared to when the first commercials ran. On those four nights, NBC ran its first commercials between two and 15 minutes after 7:30 p.m. Eastern, meaning that Nielsen did not begin rating the program until that time. Nielsen is recalculating those ratings to reflect a 7:30 start time. ''The rating may not change,'' said a Nielsen spokeswoman.</p>

        <p>Nielsen Media Research is reprocessing NBC's Olympic ratings since Friday night to reflect when the broadcasts started compared to when the first commercials ran. On those four nights, NBC ran its first commercials between two and 15 minutes after 7:30 p.m. Eastern, meaning that Nielsen did not begin rating the program until that time. Nielsen is recalculating those ratings to reflect a 7:30 start time. ''The rating may not change,'' said a Nielsen spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Nielsen was alerted to the discrepancies by CBS officials.</p>
        <p>Although NBC's broadcasts have begun at 7 p.m., the rating for the first half-hour has not been counted in the ratings six times because there were no national commercials, only local spots. That's a standard way to boost ratings because the 7-7:30 period is the lowest for viewership.</p>
        <p>Potentially, NBC's Olympic telecasts could yield a slightly higher rating the later a national commercial is inserted in the 7:30 to 8 p.m. block.</p>
        <p>The last thing NBC needs is for Nielsen to recalculate the Olympic ratings and find they're lower than they already were. The 11-night average of a 14.8 with a 26 share is down 35 percent from the rating in Atlanta four years ago, down 20 percent from Barcelona in 1992 and down 17 percent from Seoul in 1988. Each rating point equals 1.01 million television households.</p>
        <p>Monday produced some positive ratings news: against ABC's ''Monday Night Football'' from 9 p.m. to midnight, the Olympics rated a 16.5 against ABC's 10.3.</p>
