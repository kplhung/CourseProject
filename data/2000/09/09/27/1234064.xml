        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>BRITAIN: PEER CHARGED -- The millionaire author and peer Jeffrey Archer was charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice in a case that has pursued him since the 1980's. The charges result from claims that he asked a friend to provide a false alibi for him in a libel trial he won 13 years ago against a London tabloid, which had reported that he slept with a prostitute and bought her silence. Lord Archer, 60, had to step down as Conservative candidate for mayor of London last year when the accusation surfaced. The formal charges came hours before he was to make his stage debut in the role of a suspected criminal in a play he wrote called ''The Accused.''</p>

        <p>TURKEY: ARMENIA PROTEST -- Angry about a bill in Congress labeling as genocide the 1915 killings of hundreds of thousands of Armenians in Turkey, protesters rallied outside the United States Consulate in Istanbul. The House International Relations Committee is expected to approve the bill on Thursday. Whether it reaches the House before adjournment Oct. 6 is uncertain. The administration opposes it, arguing that history should decide.</p>
        <p>Douglas Frantz (NYT)</p>
        <p>GERMANY: PENSION REFORM -- The government is pursuing a plan to avert bankruptcy of the pension system. Pensions would be lowered to 64.5 percent of final salary from 70 percent by 2030, and contributions from employers and employees would be increased to 22 percent. Payments of 4 percent of earnings into a private supplement would be phased in.</p>
        <p>Victor Homola (NYT)</p>
        <p>ITALY: AMATO SHIFT -- The leaders of Italy's center-left governing coalition praised Prime Minister Giuliano Amato for pulling out of the leadership race and backing Rome's mayor, Francesco Rutelli, to run in the general election next year. The center-left trails in polls against the center-right opposition, led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Walter Veltroni, leader of the Democrats of the Left, the coalition's biggest party, said Mr. Amato had ''spoken like a man of the state and someone who has the future and the unity of the center-left at heart.''</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>MEXICO: DRUG ARREST -- A former director of the federal highway police, Enrique Harari Garduno, is under arrest in a continuing investigation of officials linked to the Juarez drug cartel, the police said. Mr. Harari Garduno is accused of receiving more than $1 million and using military vehicles to transport drugs, said Wilfrido Robledo, the drug enforcement agency chief.</p>
        <p>Tim Weiner</p>
        <p>CANADA: EYE ON ELECTIONS -- Resignation of the country's longest-serving provincial premier, Roy Romanow of Saskatchewan, has lent credence to theories that he may work in a ''unite the left'' movement in the next national elections. In farewell interviews Mr. Romanow, a figure in provincial politics since 1967, has talked about emulating Canada's right-wing fusion attempts by forging an alliance of his New Democratic Party and the governing Liberals.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>INDONESIA: BOMBING SUSPECTS -- Two Indonesian soldiers arrested after a shootout on Sunday planted a bomb that killed 15 people at the stock exchange on Sept. 13, the police said. The announcement appeared to confirm the government's assertion that rogue members of the military were behind recent bombings in Jakarta. But there was lingering public suspicion that the suspects were scapegoats.</p>

        <p>EAST TIMOR: U.N. SKIRMISH -- United Nations peacekeeping forces shot and killed a pro-Jakarta militia member in a clash in East Timor, which voted to become independent from Indonesia last year. Meanwhile the militia groups, accused of killing three United Nations aid workers, demanded the return of more than 1,000 weapons surrendered over the weekend.</p>
        <p>Calvin Sims (NYT)</p>
        <p>SRI LANKA: ARMY INROADS -- The military said it had reclaimed a strategic road leading into the town of Chavakachcheri, as well as several square miles of territory near Sarasali, in its latest offensive to reclaim the portions of the northern Jaffna Peninsula lost this spring to Tamil separatists.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>ISRAEL: NETANYAHU RULING -- The attorney general's ruling on whether to indict the rightist former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected on Thursday. Newspapers here report that he is disinclined to prosecute Mr. Netanyahu, who would thus be free to re-enter politics and try to coalesce the opposition to Prime Minister Ehud Barak.</p>
        <p>Deborah Sontag (NYT)</p>
        <p>CYPRUS: U.N. AIDE HOPEFUL -- Talks about the future of Cyprus ''are beginning to break new ground,'' a United Nations official, Alvaro de Soto, said in New York. After two weeks of separate talks with the Greek Cypriot leader, Glafcos Clerides, and his Turkish counterpart, Rauf Denktash, Mr. de Soto said that the decades-old dispute seemed to be moving toward a settlement. Talks resume in November.</p>
        <p>Barbara Crossette (NYT)</p>
        <p>IRAQ: CRUMBLING EMBARGO -- Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright expressed concern to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about recent French and Russian flights to Iraq, which have severely weakened the longstanding ban on air traffic to Baghdad. France, which allowed an antisanctions group to fly from Paris last week, has approved a second flight. Jordan may become the first Arab nation to violate the ban, officials said in Amman.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>MOZAMBIQUE: FLOOD AFTERMATH -- About 172,000 people still face severe food shortages as a result of spring floods, the World Food Program reported. Thousands of farmers cannot grow food because the land is still waterlogged.</p>
