      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges Vladimiro Montesinos, intelligence chief and all-around fixer for Peruvian Pres Alberto Fujimori, should be brought to justice; urges United States to stop pressing Panama to grant him political asylum; urges Panama to weigh prosecuting him for torture</p>

        <p>Vladimiro Montesinos, Peru's Rasputin, is now in Panama City awaiting a decision on whether he will get political asylum there. Mr. Montesinos, the intelligence chief and all-around fixer for Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori, fled the country after a videotape was televised that showed him apparently bribing a congressman. His departure on Sunday from Peru was, perhaps, the only way to break his hold on power there. But Mr. Montesinos must ultimately be brought to justice. He is accused of serious human rights abuses, and granting him asylum would be an insult to genuine victims.</p>
        <p>Panama should hold him with the goal of returning him to Peru for trial when that becomes possible. If that date seems too far away, then Panama should open an investigation to prosecute him for torture -- which any nation may do.</p>

        <p>Vladimiro Montesinos, Peru's Rasputin, is now in Panama City awaiting a decision on whether he will get political asylum there. Mr. Montesinos, the intelligence chief and all-around fixer for Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori, fled the country after a videotape was televised that showed him apparently bribing a congressman. His departure on Sunday from Peru was, perhaps, the only way to break his hold on power there. But Mr. Montesinos must ultimately be brought to justice. He is accused of serious human rights abuses, and granting him asylum would be an insult to genuine victims.</p>
        <p>Panama should hold him with the goal of returning him to Peru for trial when that becomes possible. If that date seems too far away, then Panama should open an investigation to prosecute him for torture -- which any nation may do.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos, who ran the intelligence police, was so powerful that many Peruvians believed the president worked for him. He has been credibly accused of crimes ranging from running death squads to election fraud, and the United States finally acknowledged that he has had a long relationship with American intelligence services.</p>
        <p>The tape of Mr. Montesinos apparently bribing a legislator to switch parties surfaced two weeks ago, and Mr. Fujimori promptly announced that he would hold new elections and not be a candidate, and that he had dissolved the intelligence police. Mr. Montesinos dropped out of sight, and there were rumors that his military allies were exploring the possibility of a coup. On Sunday he flew to Panama.</p>
        <p>Panama has long been a haven for unwanted despots, including the shah of Iran and former leaders of Guatemala and Haiti. But it did not want Mr. Montesinos, initially refusing to take him when Peru asked. But after pressure from Washington, the Organization of American States and several of Peru's neighbors, Panama agreed to let him in on a tourist visa while it considers his request.</p>
        <p>The best course would have been for Peru to arrest Mr. Montesinos. As this was unlikely, his exile will at least allow Peruvians to begin to erase some of his malevolent influence on their government. But Washington should stop pressing to get him asylum. The only guarantee Mr. Montesinos should receive from Panama is that he will face justice, either in Panama on charges of torture, or in Peru once it has elected a government that can try him.</p>
