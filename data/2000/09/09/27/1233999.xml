        <p>A CRISP edge on scallops really brings out their sweetness. It's easy to achieve when you saute them: dredge them in flour, cornmeal or bread crumbs before adding them to the hot pan. But if you give the crunchy crust an intense flavor, they're even better.</p>
        <p>The most basic technique is to season the flour or cornmeal with herbs or spices. But it's even easier to skip the flour and dredge the scallops in spices. It can't be done with dried herbs, which don't get crisp, or with spices that are too strong to use in quantity. But it works perfectly with curry powder, which also seasons whatever is cooked with the scallops. I add chopped tomatoes, which liquefy to make a light sauce that is wonderful over rice.</p>

        <p>A CRISP edge on scallops really brings out their sweetness. It's easy to achieve when you saute them: dredge them in flour, cornmeal or bread crumbs before adding them to the hot pan. But if you give the crunchy crust an intense flavor, they're even better.</p>
        <p>The most basic technique is to season the flour or cornmeal with herbs or spices. But it's even easier to skip the flour and dredge the scallops in spices. It can't be done with dried herbs, which don't get crisp, or with spices that are too strong to use in quantity. But it works perfectly with curry powder, which also seasons whatever is cooked with the scallops. I add chopped tomatoes, which liquefy to make a light sauce that is wonderful over rice.</p>
        <p>Curry powder is not really a spice itself but a mixture of cumin, turmeric, coriander, pepper and other spices. Since you're using a large quantity, two tablespoons, it should not be super-hot or the dish will be fiery. I prefer a mild, sweet curry powder. It should also be fairly fine; if it is too coarse, the crust will be gritty rather than crisp.</p>
        <p>Once the scallops are very lightly dredged in the curry powder, you sear them quickly. They brown in just a minute or two, and you don't want to cook them longer than that: scallops are best rare. The dish is finished with the tomatoes, lime juice and cilantro or another herb.</p>
        <p>I like to add a little fresh or sour cream or yogurt to the sauce, which turns it pink and creamy. If you use yogurt, the sauce must not boil after you add it or it will curdle; a minute after adding the tomatoes, turn the heat down to a minimum and just let the yogurt warm gently in the pan.</p>
        <p>You could also use chili powder or any other spice mix in place of curry powder.</p>
        <p>As for the herb, cilantro marries perfectly with the lime and curry, as does mint. But basil, especially the fragrant, minty Thai basil, is a more surprising and equally delicious option.</p>
        <p>CURRIED SCALLOPS WITH TOMATOES  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>3 medium tomatoes  1 tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil  1 1/2 to 2 pounds large sea scallops  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons curry powder, or to taste</p>
        <p>1/2 cup heavy cream, sour cream or yogurt, optional  Juice of 1 lime</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro, Thai basil or mint.</p>
        <p>1. Core tomatoes, and squeeze and shake out their seeds. Chop flesh into  1/2-inch pieces and set aside. Heat the oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat about 3 minutes. While it heats, sprinkle scallops with salt and pepper, and spread curry powder on a plate.</p>
        <p>2. When oil is hot, work quickly to dredge scallops lightly in curry powder, and add to pan. About 2 minutes after you add first scallop, turn it; it should be nicely browned. (If not, raise heat a bit.) When scallops are all browned and turned, cook a minute longer, and add tomatoes and heavy or sour cream if you're using it. (If you are using yogurt, lower heat immediately; it must not boil.)</p>
        <p>3. Heat tomatoes through. Taste and add more salt and pepper if necessary. Sprinkle with lime juice, stir in herb and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
