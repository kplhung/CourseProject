        <p>Earth-moving equipment has just begun digging the hole that will be the basement of a 25-story office building at 222 East 41st Street, but the building is already full, in a manner of speaking.</p>
        <p>Originally planned as a speculative project, the building is completely leased to two tenants, although they will not be able to move in until 2002. Participants said the deals illustrated the strength of the office market in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''When we first started this project at the beginning of the year, we anticipated there would be some preleasing,'' Robert Speyer, a senior director of Tishman Speyer Properties who is overseeing the development, said of the agreements to lease space before it has been built. ''We never imagined we would prelease the entire building.</p>
        <p>''The inventory of office space has dried up,'' he added. ''If we had five million square feet of space under construction, we could fill it up because of the overwhelming demand.''</p>
        <p>According to a recent report by Colliers ABR, a real estate brokerage and services company, the vacancy rate for the most modern office space in Manhattan was 3.9 percent at the end of the second quarter, but was 5.1 percent in the first quarter and 8.7 percent a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The 375,000-square-foot building adjacent to one of the exits from the Queens-Midtown Tunnel will be occupied by Scient Corporation, a technology services company, and Jones, Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue, the New York branch of a large law firm based in Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Scient signed a lease for 144,000 square feet of space before work even began and recently agreed to take the top floors, the 24th and 25th, to increase its total occupancy to 165,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>The decision by Jones, Day to take the remaining 210,000 square feet came as workers prepared the site for construction. The new location will enable the law firm to expand; it now occupies 150,000 square feet at 599 Lexington Avenue, at 52nd Street.</p>
        <p>The firm will be leaving behind views from the 30th story and above in the heart of the Midtown office district for the lower floors of a building in the largely residential area of Murray Hill. Nevertheless, it will be closer to Grand Central Terminal and in a new building  equipped with the latest technology. The move was an ''intelligent decision,'' said Mitchell Steir, vice chairman of Julien J. Studley, which represented Jones, Day in the deal.</p>
        <p>The firm's lease is for 15 years, according to real estate executives. Brokers and company officials declined to give rents for the spaces, but annual rents in the Grand Central area have been averaging about $52 a square foot in recent months, while they are about $59 a foot near the Lexington Avenue building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steir said the larger, 24,000-square-foot lower floors of the new building were more appropriate for a law firm than the smaller 12,000-square-foot floors in the tower. By leasing the space now, he said, the firm was able to influence the building's design. The East Side location was more convenient to the airports than areas farther west, he said, an important consideration for lawyers who have to travel frequently. There will be parking for 75 cars in the building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steir also said there had been some question whether Boston Properties, which owns 599 Lexington, would have be able to provide the extra space that Jones, Day needed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Speyer said Travelers Insurance Company, an equity partner of Tishman Speyer since 1997, owned the development rights to the 100-by-200-foot site, which most recently had been a parking lot. As a result, the project got under way quickly without the legal wrangles associated with most building projects in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Most of the land available for development is encumbered in some way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said the building, which will be named for Jones, Day, would be available for interior work by the fall of next year and ready for occupancy in the spring of 2002. The upper floors intended for Scient, which now uses 50,000 square feet in buildings at 860 Broadway on Union Square and at 155 West 23rd Street, will be finished by June 2002.</p>
        <p>Although Tishman Speyer has been involved in some of the biggest real estate transactions in the city in recent years, including the acquisition of Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building, it has lately been concentrating on projects in South America and Europe.</p>
        <p>This is the first new construction it has undertaken here in more than a decade. The last project was the building at 375 Hudson Street at West Houston Street, occupied by the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising agency.</p>
