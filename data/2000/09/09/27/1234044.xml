        <p>It has been said that into everyone's life a little rain must fall. Today, under bleak skies in Sydney Harbor, it descended on the United States skipper Russ Silvestri and his two dozen opponents in the Finn single-handed dinghy class as the second week of the Olympic sailing competition continued.</p>
        <p>After four previous races in the 11-race series, Silvestri, a 38-year-old investment banker from San Francisco, started the day in seventh place. When it was over, after a second-place finish and a 16th in another pair of races sailed in cool, southerly winds that peaked at about 15 knots and ultimately fell to a mere zephyr, he had moved up a notch to sixth.</p>

        <p>It has been said that into everyone's life a little rain must fall. Today, under bleak skies in Sydney Harbor, it descended on the United States skipper Russ Silvestri and his two dozen opponents in the Finn single-handed dinghy class as the second week of the Olympic sailing competition continued.</p>
        <p>After four previous races in the 11-race series, Silvestri, a 38-year-old investment banker from San Francisco, started the day in seventh place. When it was over, after a second-place finish and a 16th in another pair of races sailed in cool, southerly winds that peaked at about 15 knots and ultimately fell to a mere zephyr, he had moved up a notch to sixth.</p>
        <p>Britain's Iain Percy, who began the day as the overall leader, continued to sail a consistent series with fifth- and sixth-place finishes and, just past the midway point of the regatta, is maintaining a hefty lead.</p>
        <p>Silvestri acknowledged his day had been up and down.</p>
        <p>''In the first race everything that could go right went right,'' he said. ''It gave me a lot of confidence. I thought I had it all figured out. But it backfired a bit on the second race.''</p>
        <p>With 27 points, Percy is 13 points ahead of Fredrik Loof of France, in second. In the Olympic sailing competition, sailors receive points for the order in which they finish each race. The low score wins.</p>
        <p>Even though Silvestri, with 56 points, remains in medal contention, the United States sailing team's results thus far have been, at best, mixed. In the 49er class competition, which finished Monday, the Seattle brothers Jonathan and Charlie McKee earned bronze medals. And Wednesday, with one race left in their respective divisions, the men's 470 team of Paul Foerster and Bob Merrick, and the women's 470 duo of J. J. Isler and Pease Glaser, have a good chance at either silver or bronze medals.</p>
        <p>But the Soling team skippered by Jeff Madrigali was eliminated early. And another pre-Games medal favorite, the Star boat helmed by Mark Reynolds, is a distant seventh at the midway point of that series. The United States Tornado team, and the men's and women's boardsailing entries, whose racing has ended, all finished out of the money.</p>
        <p>In the opening week of competition the weather was probably too ideal, as the sunny, early spring conditions were accompanied by minimal breeze. The weather has changed, however, and on Course D, just inside the prominent Heads that guard the harbor entrance -- the site of today's Finn sailing, and one of six available racing circles -- the day's first race began in a chilly downpour.</p>
        <p>Storm clouds are nothing new to Silvestri, who won a spot on the United States team for the 1984 Games but then lost it because of a rules protest. So he is enjoying his first Olympic experience, the highlight of which so far has been leading the fleet to the first turning mark in the opening race of the series.</p>
        <p>''That was pretty exciting,'' he said. ''I was getting teary-eyed.''</p>
        <p>Silvestri didn't repeat that performance today, but he managed an excellent start just to windward of the defending Olympic champion, Mateusz Kusznierewicz of Poland, and parlayed that into a second-place result. Xavier Rohart of France was first.</p>
        <p>By the start of the second race the rain had halted, but the breeze was extremely fluky.</p>
        <p>''You get little rivers of wind here and there,'' Silvestri said. ''If you're in the right place you get them. If not, you don't. Sometimes you're on the good elevator, and sometimes you're on the bad one.''</p>
        <p>Halfway through the race, Silvestri was holding ninth. But on the last downwind leg, he picked the wrong corridor. ''The guys on the right smoked me,'' he said. ''And the guys on the left smoked me, too.''</p>
        <p>Drifting across the finish line in the dying breeze, Silvestri was 15 places behind the winner, David Burrows of Ireland.</p>
        <p>Although Percy has a solid lock on the lead, it has been a surprising series. After today's racing, Kusznierewicz, a dominant sailor who was last year's International Sailing Federation sailor of the year, is fourth.</p>
        <p>And after waiting 16 years for his Olympic moment, Silvestri is not yet willing to concede defeat.</p>
        <p>''In the real light air I think I'm a little vulnerable, but in anything over five knots I think I'm going pretty good,'' he said. ''Percy's been fabulous, but second and third are still wide open. If I don't get cocky, there are still a lot of races to go.''</p>
