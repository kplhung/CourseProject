        <p>The nation's senior commanders will warn Congress on Wednesday that the armed services are struggling with aging equipment, shortages in spare parts and shortfalls in training that will require billions of dollars in new spending, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines, will argue that the nation's front-line combat forces remain ready to fight.</p>
        <p>But they will also warn that the readiness of some support units has fallen, despite two years of budget increases approved by President Clinton and Congress, officials familiar with the planned testimony said today.</p>
        <p>Beyond the state of today's military, the chiefs will also focus on tomorrow's forces. They plan to argue that the Pentagon's procurement budget -- the money for new weapons and equipment -- has not risen quickly enough to begin replacing aging weapons and equipment built during the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The chiefs' testimony comes as a highly charged political debate rages about the American military, and the officials said the warnings would offer ammunition to both sides.</p>
        <p>Their argument that readiness remains high among combat forces undercuts accusations from some Republicans, including Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, that American military might is fraying.</p>
        <p>At the same time, their warnings about other readiness problems and aging weapons echo many made recently by Mr. Bush and by other military officials.</p>
        <p>The officials said that the chiefs would use Wednesday's hearings to start making the case for increases in spending and the size of the force, now at 1.4 million troops, though they might not propose specific figures.</p>
        <p>While the Clinton administration has raised the procurement budget to $60 billion, from $43 billion three years ago, the chiefs believe they need $70 billion or more as new weapons arrive in the years ahead, a senior military official said. Others have suggested the figure should rise to nearly $100 billion.</p>
        <p>''We've got an aging force structure -- in terms of airplanes, ships, tanks, et cetera -- where obsolescence will start to come into play,'' an official familiar with the chiefs' planned testimony said today.</p>
        <p>''If we don't accelerate the pace of replacing ships and airplanes,'' the official added, ''we are not going to maintain the steady-state requirements to keep the age of the force at the current level -- not to mention modernizing it.''</p>
        <p>Debates over the Pentagon's budget have always been political, but the hearings before the armed service committees of the House and the Senate on Wednesday are expected to cast this year's debate in an increasingly partisan hue.</p>
        <p>Congress has already adopted a $295 billion military budget for the fiscal year that begins on Sunday, and President Clinton has signed it.</p>
        <p>That has prompted administration officials to complain that scheduling the hearings before Election Day was simply a partisan effort to force the chiefs into voicing readiness concerns raised by Mr. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>Senator Carl M. Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the Senate's armed services committee, said he had urged that the hearing be postponed until after the election, only to be overruled by the committee's Republican chairman, Senator John W. Warner of Virginia.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we should put the chiefs in a position where they're caught in a political crossfire,'' Mr. Levin said. ''I don't know how it's avoided in this setting, given the timing.''</p>
        <p>Still, the chiefs appear intent on using the hearings as a platform to begin making a case for increased  spending by the new administration, regardless of who wins in November.</p>
        <p>Both major-party candidates have proposed increasing military spending. Mr. Bush has called for $45 billion more over the next decade; Vice President Al Gore has gone even further, proposing the spending of another $80 billion over the same period.</p>
        <p>While the officials said the chiefs had not yet completed specific budget requests, it was clear that the shortfalls they planned to cite would cost more to fill than the $4.5 billion and $8 billion annually that the two candidates have proposed.</p>
        <p>''The chiefs' appetite will be larger than anybody can satisfy,'' a senior military official said today. ''We are going higher, but they want to go higher still.''</p>
        <p>The current debate over the military's readiness -- and its budget -- began two years ago, when the chiefs at the time appeared at similar hearings and warned that the reductions in forces and spending after the cold war had left them strapped.</p>
        <p>At the time, President Clinton proposed increasing Pentagon spending by $112 billion over six years. With added financing from Congress and emergency supplements to cover peacekeeping operations like those in Kosovo, the Pentagon's budget is now projected to grow by nearly $160 billion, rising from $295 billion in the newly adopted budget to $332 billion by 2005.</p>
        <p>With the spending debate intensifying, the administration recently added another $19.5 billion to future Pentagon budgets.</p>
        <p>The officials said the chiefs would emphasize steady improvements in readiness, citing gains in morale, among other things, following increases in pay and benefits. One official said that the real impact would be felt in the year ahead as spare parts and other equipment the budget increases paid for began reaching bases around the country.</p>
        <p>The chiefs, though, are expected to argue that current readiness continues to face strains because of the high pace of operations overseas, which forces the services to give a lower priority to forces that are not deployed.</p>
        <p>One official said that a fighter wing based in Italy, for example, can maintain peak performance, but it comes at the cost for readiness by similar units in the United States, which must make do with scarce parts and less money for training.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, senior military officers have warned of readiness problems. In testimony before a subcommittee last week, the Army said it needed $4.6 billion to buy new weapons, from Abrams tanks to Apache helicopters. The Navy's inspector general warned in a report released last week that the readiness of the service's aircraft had declined because of shortages in spare parts and training.</p>
        <p>As he stepped down as commander of forces in the Persian Gulf in August, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni warned of growing strains on American troops. In an interview he, too, warned that the military was stretching the life of aging equipment -- a point the Commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James L. Jones, is expected to make on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''I climbed in a CH-46 helicopter when I was a lieutenant in Vietnam,'' General Zinni said. ''My son is a lieutenant and he climbs into the same helicopter.''</p>
        <p>With increasing warnings about readiness from the senior ranks, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen met with the chiefs early this month and cautioned them not to use politically charged debate as a means to argue for raising their budgets.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said that Mr. Cohen told them ''not to beat the drum with a tin cup in hand to try to generate more pressure for defense spending but, on the other hand, to talk honestly about pressures they face.''</p>
