        <p>Leonidas Kavakos, a Greek violinist in his 30's, made a striking impression at his first American concerts in the late 1980's and since then  has made a handful of recordings that affirm his place on the list of young fiddlers to watch.</p>
        <p>Clearly he has some influential supporters: his recital at the 92nd Street Y on Saturday evening was filmed for a broadcast on WLIW and other public televison stations. Yet for all that, there was only a small audience, so that before the concert began ushers asked people in the side sections to move toward the center, evidently to fill gaps for the sake of the camera.</p>

        <p>Leonidas Kavakos, a Greek violinist in his 30's, made a striking impression at his first American concerts in the late 1980's and since then  has made a handful of recordings that affirm his place on the list of young fiddlers to watch.</p>
        <p>Clearly he has some influential supporters: his recital at the 92nd Street Y on Saturday evening was filmed for a broadcast on WLIW and other public televison stations. Yet for all that, there was only a small audience, so that before the concert began ushers asked people in the side sections to move toward the center, evidently to fill gaps for the sake of the camera.</p>
        <p>It may be that Mr. Kavakos was thrown by the small turnout: it was not until the second half of the program, in which the works were lighter, that he seemed entirely engaged by the music. More likely the music in the first half did not suit him as well. With Peter Nagy as his pianist, Mr. Kavakos opened the concert with a peculiarly tepid account of the Brahms Sonata No. 1 (Op. 78). That isn't to say that the reading was without its beautiful moments. Midway through each movement, Mr. Kavakos and Mr. Nagy turned up the heat and began tapping the passion that makes this music sing. But they took their time getting there. It was as if they thought that only they knew what lay at the work's heart, and were reluctant to reveal the surprise too soon.</p>
        <p>Bartok's Rhapsody No. 2 had brighter armor in the form of a gruff, rustic timbre, the right sort of rhythmic edge and a higher energy level than he brought to the Brahms. But here too Mr. Kavakos seemed to hold the work at an emotional distance.</p>
        <p>His playing came to life more vividly in Alexander von Zemlinsky's Serenade in A, a youthful, melodic work with surfaces that are pretty and inviting but that do not cloak much depth. Mr. Kavakos played the piece with beauty and fluidity and he brought a measure of panache to a pair of technical dazzlers, Kreisler's ''Viennese Rhapsodic Fantasietta'' and Ernst's ''Fantasy on Hungarian Airs.''</p>
        <p>These works proved that Mr. Kavakos has a solid technique and can produce a sweet, appealing sound. But they left unresolved the question, raised in the Brahms and Bartok, of whether he has the curiosity and interpretive inventiveness to dig deeper when music demands it.</p>
