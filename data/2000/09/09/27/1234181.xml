        <p>Living.com, a bankrupt Internet furniture retailer, will not be allowed to sell customer lists without customer consent under a settlement proposed by the office of the Texas attorney general, John Cornyn. He proposed the settlement in a federal bankruptcy court in Austin amid general concerns from privacy advocates that defunct dot-com companies will seek to sell, as assets, names and other data from their customer lists. In the most widely publicized such case, the Federal Trade Commission sued earlier this year to stop ToySmart.com, a bankrupt toy retailer, from selling such lists as part of its liquidation. For its part, Living.com's privacy policy promised customers their names would not be sold if they registered their objections via e-mail. Under the proposed settlement, customer lists can be sold, but only if those on the lists are informed and given a chance to object.</p>
