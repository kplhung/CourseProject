        <p>Intel said today that it had been notified by the Federal Trade Commission that its investigation into the company's business practices had been closed. The investigation began in September 1997 in response to complaints that Intel had used anticompetitive practices to cement its near monopoly in microprocessors for personal computers. In a letter addressed to Craig Barrett, Intel's president and chief executive, Richard Parker, director of the F.T.C.'s Competition Bureau, wrote, ''It now appears that no further action is warranted by the commission at this time.'' The F.T.C. has also closed its investigation into whether Intel's acquisition of Chips and Technologies and equity in Real3D had any anticompetitive effect on any markets for graphics components or other computer hardware. ''The closure of the investigation reflects our view that Intel conducts its business in an ethical and lawful manner,'' Mr. Barrett said in a statement.</p>
