        <p>JACKSON-Phillip L. 49, died September 22 after a long and courageous struggle with AIDS. Phil, a partner in the law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling, was a leading international corporate and securities lawyer with a distinguished and devoted clientele. His practice was characterized by the highest standards of integrity, intellect, and devotion to his clients. Phil was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and graduated first in his class at the University of Oklahoma. Upon graduation he took up a Rhodes Scholarship to Merton College, Oxford, where he read Classics and Philosophy. He took his law degree from the University of Chicago in 1979, and thereafter commenced practice at Shearman &amp; Sterling, where he spent his entire legal career. A devoted friend, author, classicist, musician, photographer and traveler, Phil is survived by his loving partner, Dat Chi Luong; by his beloved parents, George H. and Frances M. Jackson; his brothers George H. and R. Kern Jackson; and by six nieces and nephews. A memorial service in celebration of Phil's life will be held on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 3:30 PM at St. Peter's Church, Citicorp Center, 619 Lexington Avenue at 54th Street, NY, NY. In lieu of flowers, friends are invited to make contributions in Phillip's memory to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.</p>
