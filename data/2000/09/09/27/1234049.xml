        <p>Republicans and conservatives around the country desperately want Rick Lazio to beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New York Senate race. Yet the Lazio campaign is forcing them to rethink two of their most cherished dogmas: Republican faith in soft money, the  unrestricted donations to political parties and outside groups that are used to help campaigns, and conservative aversion to campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's reluctant acceptance Saturday of a soft-money ban was a victory for Mr. Lazio. The New York Senate 2000 Committee, an arm of the Democratic senatorial campaign organization that has been advertising on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, was spending more than $1 million a week of soft money  on TV ''issue ads,'' with a lot more to come. Mr. Lazio has raised more hard money (that is, individual contributions directly to the campaign, which are limited to $1,000 a person) than Mrs. Clinton. If the agreement to ban soft money more or less holds, as pressure from the media may ensure, Mr. Lazio should have an advertising advantage in the last month of the campaign.</p>

        <p>Republicans and conservatives around the country desperately want Rick Lazio to beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in the New York Senate race. Yet the Lazio campaign is forcing them to rethink two of their most cherished dogmas: Republican faith in soft money, the  unrestricted donations to political parties and outside groups that are used to help campaigns, and conservative aversion to campaign finance reform.</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's reluctant acceptance Saturday of a soft-money ban was a victory for Mr. Lazio. The New York Senate 2000 Committee, an arm of the Democratic senatorial campaign organization that has been advertising on behalf of Mrs. Clinton, was spending more than $1 million a week of soft money  on TV ''issue ads,'' with a lot more to come. Mr. Lazio has raised more hard money (that is, individual contributions directly to the campaign, which are limited to $1,000 a person) than Mrs. Clinton. If the agreement to ban soft money more or less holds, as pressure from the media may ensure, Mr. Lazio should have an advertising advantage in the last month of the campaign.</p>
        <p>So much for Republicans' belief that soft money is their friend. Republicans, of course, as a pro-business party, have raised their share of soft money. But the Democrats have now caught up and, in fact, are moving ahead. Soft-money raising, focused on economic interests and unconstrained by any legal limit on contributions, is particularly suited to the Democratic Party of the Bill Clinton era -- a party that is at once pro-business and pro-government and that is willing to approach corporate interests with the prospect that government policies can help or harm their industries. That's why the committees that aid Democratic candidates for Congress are in their best position in decades relative to their Republican counterparts -- despite the Republicans' majorities in Congress.</p>
        <p>Most competitive Republican candidates, on the other hand, have an advantage in $1,000 donations and an even bigger advantage in smaller contributions. Isn't it in Republicans' interest to revive the hard money system by increasing individual limits and curbing the soft money system? Rick Lazio thinks so. And others are coming around to this view.</p>
        <p>Why did Mrs. Clinton agree to a limit that could hurt her campaign? Because she thought that not agreeing would harm her even more. She was probably right.</p>
        <p>Conventional wisdom in Washington, especially conservative conventional wisdom, is that campaign finance reform doesn't matter as an issue. Conservatives resolutely refuse to learn any lesson from John McCain's thumping of George W. Bush in New Hampshire, when he made campaign reform his central theme -- or from Mr. McCain's subsequent defeat after he veered from that message. But campaign reform turns out to have surprising political salience. Conservatives should welcome this fact, since they have no stake in the current system.</p>
        <p>The great conservative triumphs of our time came, after all, before the rise of soft money: Ronald Reagan's near-victory, fueled by small-dollar, hard-money donations, in his primary challenge of 1976; the conservative gains in the Congressional elections of 1978 and 1980; and Mr. Reagan's winning presidential campaign of 1980. The full flowering of the soft money system in 1996 has coincided with a period of conservative political and policy retreat.</p>
        <p>Is it too much to ask our fellow Republicans and conservatives to rethink their self-defeating defense of the current corrupt campaign finance system, and shape campaign reform legislation that would be good for them and for the country?</p>
