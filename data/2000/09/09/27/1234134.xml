        <p>THE DEBATES</p>
        <p>NO SURPRISE INVITATIONS -- The Commission on Presidential Debates has formally invited Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to participate in the first of three planned debates, on Tuesday at the University of Massachusetts in Boston.</p>
        <p>The bipartisan commission said yesterday that of the seven major party and minor party candidates whose names were on ballots in enough states to ''have a theoretical chance of winning a majority of the votes in the Electoral College,'' only Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush met all of the panel's requirements. The central requirement is that a candidate must have the support of an average of 15 percent in five national polls by news organizations.</p>
        <p>Two of the excluded candidates, Ralph Nader of the Green Party and Patrick J. Buchanan of the Reform Party, have repeatedly criticized the 15-percent threshold as virtually unobtainable for a third-party contender.</p>
        <p>The commission also invited the major party candidates for vice president, Dick Cheney and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, to a debate on Oct. 5. Peter Marks (NYT)</p>
        <p>BOOK AGENT TAKES PARTISAN ROLE -- Dick Cheney got a bit of a surprise when he found out whom Senator Joseph I. Lieberman has tapped as his surrogate Dick Cheney for practice debates. It's Robert Barnett, the Washington lawyer and book agent who represents Lynne Cheney, Mr. Cheney's wife. ''He's Lynne's book agent!'' Mr. Cheney said when he got the news. To which Mrs. Cheney joked, ''My former book agent. Until this minute he was my book agent.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cheney, who has written several books, has the Secret Service code name Author. Mr. Lieberman has also written several books. His agent: Robert Barnett. How does Mr. Cheney think Mr. Barnett will do portraying him? ''I'm sure he does fine,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''He's a smart guy.''</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>PLEA ON SOFT MONEY -- The Senate's leading supporters of campaign finance legislation appealed to Al Gore and George W. Bush yesterday to follow the lead set in New York's Senate race and ban soft money advertisements in the presidential contest.</p>
        <p>''In the same spirit that motivated the Lazio-Clinton agreement, we respectfully encourage you to attempt to make a similar agreement in your race,'' Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in a letter sent to the White House hopefuls. Similar letters were also sent to all candidates for the House and Senate. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore did not immediately respond.</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush continued seeking votes and campaign cash Out West yesterday, courting Californians with his message of a recession in education. Al Gore, meanwhile, worked swing states throughout the Midwest, talking mainly about Medicare but digressing while meeting with some Michigan twentysomethings to rap about everything from medicinal marijuana to recycling. The stats:</p>
        <p>Length of the Official Day: Gore, 13  1/2hours; Bush, 14 hours</p>
        <p>States Visited: Gore, 3; Bush, 1</p>
        <p>Towns and Cities Visited: Gore, 3; Bush, 3</p>
        <p>Events: Gore, 3; Bush, 4</p>
        <p>Press Conferences/Interviews: Gore, 6; Bush, 7.</p>
        <p>Diners Visited/Unscheduled Drop-bys: Gore, 0; Bush 1</p>
        <p>Main message: Gore, strengthening Medicare; Bush, improving education.</p>
