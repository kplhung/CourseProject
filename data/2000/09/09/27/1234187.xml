        <p>The Yankees have fielded a slumping player or started a struggling pitcher here or there since they resumed their postseason greatness four years ago. But they have never had a hole as big as the one they are expected to haul into the playoffs next week.</p>
        <p>No one will ever get a chance to exploit it, though, if the Yankees are fortunate. If they are lucky, their starting pitchers will pitch deep into games and hand a big lead to the three veteran relievers. But if patient opponents wear down the Yankee starters or a game lingers into extra innings, then Manager Joe Torre will have to reach deep into his bullpen, and he won't have any idea what to expect.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' clinching number in the American League East is down to one, but they flubbed a chance to wrap things up here tonight. At almost the same time Jorge Posada crushed a game-tying home run in the top of the ninth, Toronto's loss at Baltimore was posted on the scoreboard, and the Yankees knew they could start spraying Champagne if they could just beat Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>But Jeff Nelson walked Randy Winn to open the bottom of the ninth, and Winn scored the winning run with two out when Fred McGriff singled off Mike Stanton to give the Devil Rays a 2-1 victory, the Yankees' 10th loss in 13 games.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are in jeopardy of losing home field advantage to Seattle or Oakland at the start of next week's playoffs. ''We've got to get used to winning games again,'' said Paul O'Neill, who was out at the plate in the eighth inning when he tagged up from third base after the Yankees had men on second and third and nobody out.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez pitched exceptionally, allowing two hits and one run over eight innings; he and his fellow starters Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte have all thrown well in the last six weeks, and with the exception of tonight's game, Nelson, Stanton and Mariano Rivera have been effective in recent days.</p>
        <p>But there is no way of knowing how the other four members of the staff will fare; Denny Neagle and three middle relievers provide as much mystery as the meat served in college cafeterias. Now might be when the loss of the versatile Ramiro Mendoza, who had shoulder surgery last week, really hurts the Yankees.</p>
        <p>One week from now, Torre might have to turn to his bullpen in the middle innings and choose among Jason Grimsley, Dwight Gooden, Randy Choate and David Cone, without any real sense of what he's going to get. ''They don't have anywhere near the kind of depth they had the last few years,'' said one scout trailing the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Since June 14, Grimsley has allowed 62 hits, 28 walks and 40 earned runs in 51 innings, with a 7.06 earned run average. He can be unhittable when his mechanics are proper and when throwing strikes. He is utterly useless when he lacks command, because his wildness is often all encompassing and he can throw 8 or 10 consecutive pitches out of the strike zone.</p>
        <p>If Grimsley pitches as effectively as he did in the one postseason outing he made last year, in Game 3 of the World Series, he could fill the void created by Mendoza's injury; if his wildness continues, Torre could be reluctant to use him.</p>
        <p>Gooden is 4-2 with a 3.43 E.R.A. since joining the Yankees before midseason, but is limited in what he can do. Torre has used him in long relief about once a week, and in a five-game series, it would seem that Gooden might be available for one outing, possibly two. Knowing this, Torre might hold him in reserve until he needs to replace a starting pitcher early in a game when the score is still relatively close.</p>
        <p>Gooden has been mostly used to start an inning, and he gradually works into a comfort zone -- the first batter has reached base with a walk or hit in 6 of Gooden's 11 relief appearances.</p>
        <p>Choate ascended from Class AA to the majors this year as he developed into a left-handed specialist, and right now, he probably is the front-runner to beat out Cone for the 10th and final spot on the postseason roster of pitchers. Torre was impressed with his work in Monday's game.</p>
        <p>''He had a good breaking ball and he was very aggressive,'' Torre said. ''That may have been the best he's been all year.''</p>
        <p>Left-handed batters are hitting .194 against Choate, with seven hits and three walks in 39 plate appearances. The Mariners have the left-handed hitter John Olerud, and the Athletics' lineup is heavy with left-handed hitters.</p>
        <p>But Choate is a rookie, and when his emotions overwhelm him and he overthrows, his breaking ball turns into benign mush. Choate could be O.K., or he could fail. He will be completely unpredictable.</p>
        <p>The Yankee starters could overcome the questionable middle relief by pitching into the late innings -- Clemens going eight innings and Rivera pitching the ninth, for example. But the Mariners and the Athletics are remarkably patient in their at-bats, and could quickly drive up the pitch counts of the starters.</p>
        <p>Seattle averages 3.96 pitches per plate appearance and Oakland 3.92, far better than the American League average of 3.80, and the Mariners and the Athletics rank first and second in drawing walks.</p>
        <p>Neagle, presumably the Game 4 starter, has floundered lately, giving up 14 runs in seven and two-thirds innings over his last two starts, and those outings have followed a consistent pattern: Neagle begins making a mechanical mistake that he cannot correct immediately, and he is quickly ripped. ''It's like he's all or nothing,'' another scout said.</p>
        <p>Neagle could finish the season strong on Wednesday, when he will pitch with an opportunity to clinch the division. But what happens between now and the start of the playoffs will not change the notion that for the first time in Torre's five years as manager, the Yankees will go into the postseason with a core weakness.</p>
