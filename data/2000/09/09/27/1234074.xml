        <p>A green and white circus tent at the edge of a country pond was pulsing with a bass beat last week, as Toni Blackman and FreeStyle Union, a group of rap artists, weaved back and forth on stage, microphones pressed to their lips.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blackman asked the audience of high school students and teachers to provide her with themes for the group's next impromptu rap.</p>
        <p>''Bowling,'' yelled one teenager.</p>
        <p>''Spirituality,'' shouted another.</p>
        <p>The D.J. cranked an insistent funk beat, and the rappers began rhyming, telling a story of a young woman searching for her soul in all the wrong places.</p>
        <p>''I remember Sally from the Valley at the bowling alley,'' began Ghost, another rapper in FreeStyle Union, waving a hand along with the beat.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blackman continued, ''She got baptized, got lost, got water in her eyes.''</p>
        <p>The performance was not part of a rap show, but was the highlight of a conference promoting the use of hip-hop culture in the classroom that took place at the Geraldine R. Dodge Poetry Festival last week at Waterloo Village in Stanhope, N.J.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blackman's group demonstrated several ways to improvise rhymes, or freestyle -- by telling a story, solving a riddle or arguing opposing points -- to music. But the underlying goal is to get students in touch with impromptu expression and thereby encourage them to read, write and think more deeply about language. Judging from the audience response under the tent, that approach is wildly popular among teenagers.</p>
        <p>In much the same way that some teachers in the 1960's used the lyrics of popular folk musicians like Joan Baez and Bob Dylan to interest students in lyricism and rhyme schemes, many English teachers today are embracing rap lyrics as a means of drawing students into poetry and literature and connecting to them in a way that traditional poetry  might not at first.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, teachers at the conference said, many schools shunned rap, because of its reputation for crude language, its derogatory messages about women and its association with violence. But as hip-hop has become more ingrained in popular culture, and as educators have put a greater emphasis on the positive aspects of rap -- like its wordplay, rhyme schemes and focus on contemporary social issues -- using rap music to teach classical poetry has become an increasingly familiar strategy in the classroom, poets and teachers at the conference said. (There are no statistics that track the prevalence of such programs in schools.)</p>
        <p>Stanley Kunitz, 95, the nation's newly appointed poet laureate and a featured speaker at the Dodge Festival, which drew 15,000 people, said he embraced the use of rap in the classroom because it helped excite young people about language and the creative act.</p>
        <p>''Rap is part of that spoken tradition,'' he said, ''and representative of the spontaneity of invention, and is associated with the broad base of our democracy.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, rap is not an end in itself. ''I think the important aspect of introducing any populist speech pattern is to link it with other manifestations,'' he said, ''such as nursery rhymes and even popular songs and other forms of speech that have a different kind of energy from utilitarian speech.''</p>
        <p>And he cautioned that using rap in the classroom could be ''dangerous territory,'' because of the crude or violent nature of some of its lyrics.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blackman, 30, a bright-eyed singer with a smoky voice, and other members of FreeStyle Union, based in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, regularly travel to schools across New York, Washington  and South Africa, conducting workshops for teachers and students.</p>
        <p>She said they were often invited by teachers, particularly older teachers,  who believe they have lost touch with their students and are eager to find a way to excite them about the material.</p>
        <p>''It's giving the kids another way of thinking about writing and literacy,'' Ms. Blackman said. ''In order to improvise well and freestyle well, you have to have vocabulary, you have to have a knowledge base to draw upon. So, it's a back-door way of getting kids excited about language.''</p>
        <p>Tony Medina, a professor of English at Long Island University's Brooklyn campus, and the author of the book of poetry  ''Sermons From the Smell of a Carcass Condemned to Begging'' (Long Shot Productions, 1998), said he recently used lyrics from a song by Nas, a popular rap artist, during a poetry workshop in a high school classroom in New York. The song is written from the perspective of a gun being used to commit a violent crime.</p>
        <p>After reading Nas's lyrics, Mr. Medina asked his students to write their own poems, drawing on their experiences, but looking at them from an atypical perspective. For example, if a student wanted to write about police brutality, Mr. Medina might suggest writing it from the officer's vantage point. He said that after students were able to look at their own lives through the prism of the poetic craft, they would consider poetry from different time periods, or different countries, more sympathetically.</p>
        <p>''You can introduce rap to them and then go to poets who come from their background, like poets who come from the 'hood,'' Mr. Medina said. ''Then they say, 'Wow, the stuff that comes from our background really matters,' and that appeals to them. From there, you will open the kids up to Robert Frost or Shakespeare or Emily Dickinson.''</p>
        <p>But many educators and school administrators are still wary of rap in the classroom. Mr. Medina and Ms. Blackman said they were sometimes criticized for allowing students to read crude language or use it, or for studying politically controversial material. Mr. Medina said he was not afraid of allowing students to read crass words, though he pushes them to explore more sophisticated language in their own work. Ms. Blackman does not allow cursing or derogatory terms in her freestyling workshops.</p>
        <p>Others are skeptical about rap's value as a teaching tool. Robert Pinsky, whom Mr. Kunitz is succeeding as poet laureate, said using rap to get students interested in poetry might be ''a valid way to start.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, it may lead students off on the wrong tangent.</p>
        <p>''The truth is, it's starting from show biz and mass culture,'' he said. ''The most important thing about poetry is that it is not mass culture, and the medium of poetry is the opposite of a mass medium. It is anyone who says the poem aloud. The idea is that words sound excellent no matter who speaks them, even if it's not Sir John Gielgud, not a rapper, not a performer by nature.''</p>
        <p>He is also concerned that using popular culture to draw students to poetry may be a form of pandering to the lowest common denominator.</p>
        <p>''It would be too bad to underestimate students, or to assume that they are only capable of understanding things that mass culture has already trained them to appreciate,'' Mr. Pinsky said. ''Kids like lots of different things, and you can't predict what kids are going to like based on their age or ethnicity or anything else.''</p>
        <p>After her performance, Ms. Blackman  asked audience members to give free styling a shot. Four young men, two black and two white, took the microphones and wowed the crowd with off-the-cuff rapping.</p>
        <p>One of them, Joe Freeman, an 18-year-old senior at the Germantown Friends School in Philadelphia, elicited rousing applause from the audience with an impromptu rhyme about homework. Although he said he appreciated contemporary poets like Mark Doty and Saul Williams, and writes verse on paper, he said he also valued what rapping teaches him about self-expression.</p>
        <p>''There's an obvious difference between classical poetry and hip-hop, because rap is about the streets and about yourself, whereas classical poetry is about being beautiful, and looking at things from a different angle,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''I don't feel like it's about the person's life, but hip-hop and rap is. It's a message right in your face; you can't miss it.''</p>
        <p>Other students who attended Ms. Blackman's workshop said they were disappointed that their schools had not embraced contemporary musical styles to help them think about self-expression.</p>
        <p>''They don't let us express our feelings or introduce it in a way that would make it more fun for us,'' said Tashawyna Richardson, 15, a junior at Binghamton High School in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>Her classmate D'Asia Grace said she started writing rap-influenced poetry on her own and found that reading the work of other poets, like Langston Hughes, Robert Frost and Shakespeare, in school added to her appreciation.</p>
        <p>''Whatever poetry you read, you have to have an open mind,'' said Ms. Grace, 16, ''and not put blockades on it, like saying what you have to learn. That helps you like it.''</p>
