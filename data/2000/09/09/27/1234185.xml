        <p>Increasing her winning streak to 32 matches, Venus Williams won the tennis gold medal in singles with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Elena Dementieva of Russia.</p>
        <p>MORE GOLD IN SOFTBALL -- The United States softball team, despite three losses in the preliminary round, won another gold medal by defeating Japan, 2-1, in extra innings.</p>
        <p>A HOMER WORTH A MEDAL -- The Americans advanced to the gold-medal baseball game by defeating South Korea, 3-2, on a ninth-inning home run. The United States will face Cuba today for the Olympic championship.</p>
        <p>WAR ABOUT DRUGS -- The doping case of the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, the husband of the star sprinter Marion Jones, spotlights the growing division between the United States and international Olympic officials.</p>
        <p>JONES ADVANCES -- Putting aside the controversy surrounding her husband's drug suspension, Marion Jones resumed her gold-medal quest and easily won her qualifying heat in the 200-meter race.</p>
