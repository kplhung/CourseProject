        <p>He did not have to choose between boxers or briefs.

        <p>He did not have to choose between boxers or briefs. But in a lengthy MTV forum today, broadcast tonight, Vice President Al Gore did reveal that he had a compact disc by the alternative rock band Sister Hazel in his CD player right then, that he would probably write for a living if he were not otherwise employed next year, and that he coveted Air Force One more than any other White House perquisite.</p>
        <p>Between hip cultural references about Napster and the World Wrestling Federation (''Smackdown!'' Mr. Gore exclaimed when the topic was raised), the vice president explained his support for civil unions between homosexuals, his opposition to the legalization of medical marijuana and his distaste for misogynistic music. He was not asked about his underwear preference, as President Clinton was in a now infamous 1994 MTV forum (''Usually briefs,'' he responded).</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said little in the 90-minute session that he had not said previously during the campaign. But he clearly relished the opportunity to take his case directly to 150 students in an auditorium at the University of Michigan and to a youthful nationwide television audience. A recent poll by MTV found that less than half of those ages 18 to 24 said they planned to vote this year, compared with 80 percent of older Americans.</p>
        <p>Wearing khaki Dockers and a sage shirt, Mr. Gore pledged to commit more money to college financial aid, to protect the environment and to safeguard abortion rights. But the drama of the session was provided by the students' ability to personalize questions on subjects the Gore campaign is accustomed to addressing in position papers and statements.</p>
        <p>A black student asked Mr. Gore about racial profiling by telling how he was recently surrounded by six police cars while driving with four black friends. A gay man asked why his heterosexual friends should be able to drive to Las Vegas and marry someone they barely know when he cannot form a legal union with a longtime, committed partner. A woman who opposes abortion rights asked about that issue by pointing out that her friends sometimes use abortion as a form of birth control.</p>
        <p>Responding to the question about profiling, Mr. Gore pledged to sign a ban on the practice as ''the first civil rights act of the 21st century.''</p>
        <p>On gay rights, he said he strongly favors ending discrimination against gays and lesbians. ''I just think we've come to the point in our nation's history where it's time to take that step,'' he said. ''It's indefensible. Let's just leave people alone and stop discriminating against them because of who they fall in love with.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he supported civil unions like those recently approved in Vermont.</p>
        <p>On abortion, the vice president said that RU-486, the abortion pill, should be made available once the Food and Drug Administration determines it is safe. He also agreed that the practice should not be used as a form of birth control.</p>
        <p>''But I think that it's not for the government to make that choice,'' Mr. Gore said. ''I deeply respect your view and I think actually the pro-life and pro-choice forces in this country have more in common than either side is willing to acknowledge. Both sides would like to see a reduction in the number of abortions, and the way to do that is to reduce the number of situations where women feel like they have to make that choice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also took questions on popular culture and the entertainment industry, which has been a focus of his campaign this month.</p>
        <p>He said he did not support censorship. But he also did not hesitate to offer his personal view that Americans should protest entertainment that advocates homophobia, violence against women or racial discrimination. ''I don't go along with the notion that if material like that becomes widely accepted and nobody thinks a second thought about it that there are no consequences to it,'' he said. ''I think that what we listen to and enjoy and spread around in our culture does have an effect on us.''</p>
        <p>One student told Mr. Gore he was tempted to vote for Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate, and challenged him to ''assure me that a vote for Al Gore is a conscientious vote, not simply a vote for the lesser of two evils.'' Mr. Gore cited his support for tough environmental enforcement  and consumer protections.</p>
        <p>''I don't think anybody wants to feel like they have no options,'' Mr. Gore said. ''At the same time, they don't want to cast a meaningless vote that doesn't have an impact on the outcome.''</p>
