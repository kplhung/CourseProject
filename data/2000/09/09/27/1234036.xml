        <p>CHEFS who are finding new ways to make kosher food stylish are not pushing the limits of dietary laws but instead are simply rethinking their approach.</p>
        <p>Rather than looking to the traditional sources of inspiration, like Eastern European or classic French cuisine, many are homing in on Mediterranean cooking, which is not just trendy but surprisingly well suited to kosher constraints.

        <p>CHEFS who are finding new ways to make kosher food stylish are not pushing the limits of dietary laws but instead are simply rethinking their approach.</p>
        <p>Rather than looking to the traditional sources of inspiration, like Eastern European or classic French cuisine, many are homing in on Mediterranean cooking, which is not just trendy but surprisingly well suited to kosher constraints. Il Patrizio, for instance, serves pizza, roasted fish and vegetable appetizers like potatoes with artichokes and spinach.</p>
        <p>''Mediterranean food doesn't use much dairy,'' said Joseph Amatruda of Prime Grill, ''so we can borrow freely from it, just as long as we stay away from the shellfish dishes.'' He encrusts rack of lamb with Syrian spices, for instance.</p>
        <p>Laura Frankel of Shallots said she is also focusing on the foods of France, Spain, Italy, Morocco and Greece, which she said ''lend themselves well to kosher cooking -- there's a lot of oil, fresh herbs and lemon juice.'' One of her dishes is a red lentil soup seasoned with Moroccan spices.</p>
        <p>These chefs are also tracking down versions of fashionable ingredients that have been certified kosher. Mr. Amatruda has found kosher nori wrappers, wasabi and rice for his sushi bar but says he is still searching for kosher truffle oil and sherry wine vinegar.</p>
        <p>Ms. Frankel relies on the Internet to help her find kosher versions of ingredients like chestnut flour and porcini powder.</p>
        <p>Neither substitutes margarine for butter to make their meat meals kosher. For his mashed potatoes, Mr. Amatruda mixes in vegetable or herb purees, or even plain olive oil, instead of butter. Ms. Frankel does not make sauces finished with butter or cream but instead uses infusions and reductions. ''It ends up healthier anyway,'' she said.</p>
