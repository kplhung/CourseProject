        <p>With oil prices at their highest level in a decade and the United States and other industrial countries calling for relief, heads of state and oil ministers from the 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are to begin a two-day summit meeting here on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Since the group is more united than in the recent past, and several of its members, including the host, Venezuela, anticipate record oil revenue this year, the mood of the gathering promises to be both celebratory and unbending.</p>
        <p>The meeting also offers President Hugo Chavez, who has played an important role in the tripling of world oil prices over the last 18 months, a chance to step onto the world stage as a critic of the rich and defender of the poor.</p>
        <p>''OPEC has risen again,'' Mr. Chavez exulted in a televised speech to his country on Monday. He described the price of crude oil, which last week soared at one point to nearly $38 a barrel before retreating some, as ''fair and just'' and said that with ''the equilibrium of the universe hanging in the balance,'' he wanted the oil producers' group to use its power to create ''a more just world.''</p>
        <p>''For a century, they took millions of barrels of oil at giveaway prices,'' Mr. Chavez said Sunday on his weekly radio program, referring to the ''bad habits'' of industrial nations in another preview of the arguments he is likely to make during the conference. ''How nice it would be if they also lowered the prices of things they sell to us, lowered the prices of computers, medicine, cars and the interest rates on the foreign debt,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ali Rodriguez Araque, the president of OPEC and Venezuela's oil minister, said no decision on a production increase would be made during the conference. The cartel's members account for three-quarters of the world's proven oil reserves and more than 40 percent of output.</p>
        <p>Consumer nations have been calling for such a step, but Mr. Rodriguez said it would not be discussed until an OPEC ministers' meeting on Nov. 12.</p>
        <p>The gathering here begins, though, with cartel members unsure how to respond to the Clinton administration's decision last week to release 30 million barrels of crude oil from the United States reserve.</p>
        <p>Since Thursday, after Vice President Al Gore's call for the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, prices have fallen by about $4 a barrel. Today in Washington, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the administration would consider releasing more oil in 30 days if prices did not stay down.</p>
        <p>Oil prices were little changed today in New York, where the November delivery price fell 7 cents, to $31.50 a barrel.</p>
        <p>Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, initially dismissed Mr. Clinton's move as ''an election ploy requested by Al Gore,'' but upon arrival here Monday, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the American action ''will stabilize the price of oil.''</p>
        <p>Algeria's oil minister, Chakib Khelil, criticized the American move as ''a very short-term measure that may give the wrong signal that OPEC doesn't have enough capacity'' to meet market demand.</p>
        <p>His Libyan counterpart, Abdullah Salem el-Badri, said the action by the United States ''comes at the wrong time.''</p>
        <p>During the conference, OPEC members are also expected to increase criticism of the calls made by industrial nations at the International Monetary Fund talks in Prague over the weekend for OPEC to contain the price of oil.</p>
        <p>OPEC members argue that the main sources of high prices at the gasoline pump are high demand and exorbitant taxes in industrial nations.</p>
        <p>''We have done our part'' by increasing production by a total of 3.2 million barrels a day this year, OPEC's general secretary, Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, said at a news conference here Monday. ''If they want to bury their heads in the ground over the heads of their citizens, that's up to them,'' he added, referring to European nations that have led the call for lower oil prices as many of their people have blocked roads and otherwise engaged in public protest.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Rodriguez argues that OPEC is already producing two million barrels a day more than the world economy needs and that speculators are benefiting at the expense of consumers. In the last six months, he said, ''OPEC was supplying the market more than was required, and that means stocks are building somewhere.''</p>
        <p>This week's gathering here is only the second in OPEC's 40-year history intended to bring heads of state of member countries together, the other having been a 1975 meeting in Algeria. Efforts to organize similar events have foundered in the past, in 1980 because of war between Iran and Iraq and in 1990 with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Venezuela was chosen as the site in part because it holds OPEC's rotating presidency, but also because OPEC's founding was largely a Venezuelan initiative. On Sept. 10, 1960, with the price of oil falling, Venezuela's energy minister at the time, Juan Pablo Perez Alfonso, persuaded four Mideast nations to join him in ''securing a steady income to the producing countries.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, though, Venezuela, which has the largest reserves of oil outside the Middle East, earned a reputation in the cartel as a quota buster, almost always willing to raise production in an effort to compensate for falling prices. As the price of crude oil fell below $10 a barrel and OPEC members drifted deeper into debt, those complaints intensified.</p>
        <p>Since taking office in February 1999, Mr. Chavez has become one of the leading hawks within OPEC, creating the possibility of conflict with more cautious members like Saudi Arabia. Venezuela produces 2.65 million barrels a day, more than six times its domestic consumption. Mr. Chavez hopes to use the windfall resulting from expected petroleum revenue of $26 billion this year, up more than $10 billion over last year, to help finance an ambitious $2.1 billion social works program he announced earlier this month.</p>
        <p>''OPEC has increased its production this year much more than is necessary,'' he said recently. ''We must never allow ourselves to fall to our knees again.''</p>
        <p>Hoping to expand OPEC's influence further, the Venezuelan president has also made it clear that he would like to see new members enter the group. Early this month he invited Russia to join, and he has said that the door is also open to Latin American producers like Ecuador, Colombia and Mexico.</p>
        <p>''This meeting isn't only about oil,'' Mr. Chavez, a former army colonel sometimes described as a populist, said on Monday. The president, who led led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992, said it was also necessary for the oil group to take the lead in discussing issues of ''poverty, inequality in the world, foreign debt and the autonomy of nations.''</p>
