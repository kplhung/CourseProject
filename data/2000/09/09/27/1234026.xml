        <p>To much of the television audience -- especially the women and other casual sports followers NBC claims to be eager to court -- the Olympics is not an athletic event but an entertainment event that happens to be about sports. You wouldn't want to go to a cocktail party and not know who Tiger Woods is. In theory, the Olympics should produce the same need-to-know buzz. You wouldn't want to go to a party and not know what was going on in Sydney.</p>
        <p>But to those of us watching at home, what's going on in Sydney is an overproduced, misbegotten mess. This marathon of coverage should have been as huge as ''Survivor,'' but is turning out to more like ''Big Brother'': people only talk about it to say how dull it is.

        <p>To much of the television audience -- especially the women and other casual sports followers NBC claims to be eager to court -- the Olympics is not an athletic event but an entertainment event that happens to be about sports. You wouldn't want to go to a cocktail party and not know who Tiger Woods is. In theory, the Olympics should produce the same need-to-know buzz. You wouldn't want to go to a party and not know what was going on in Sydney.</p>
        <p>But to those of us watching at home, what's going on in Sydney is an overproduced, misbegotten mess. This marathon of coverage should have been as huge as ''Survivor,'' but is turning out to more like ''Big Brother'': people only talk about it to say how dull it is. The features are more mawkish than ever and the competition coverage packaged in snippets so busy they make a music video look leisurely.</p>
        <p>In its relentless search for high drama, NBC has stumbled into high camp. One of its most memorable segments came early and may be hard to top. ''It has been 6,000 years since man first forged a relationship with the horse,'' Harry Smith said in a feature about the equestrian competition, using the grandiose tone that puts the development of the human-animal bond up there with the first cave painting. ''The journey has brought us,'' he went on, (''us'' being people and horsies), ''together in a place called trust.''</p>
        <p>Some things, like the killer 15-hour time difference, are beyond the network's control. Knowing the results is unavoidable, even on NBC. Typically, on Saturday's ''Today'' show, David Bloom warned viewers to turn down the volume if they didn't want to know results; then there was a picture of Marion Jones holding a gold medal. You think she won?</p>
        <p>But NBC could have avoided its lethal mix: features so melodramatic they are unintentionally comic, and a style so choppy it attenuates suspense instead of building it, so slick it is nearly impossible to tell the commercials from the so-called reporting.</p>
        <p>All the drama, of course, is artificially constructed half a day after the fact. But it is constructed in a predictable pattern that is already a parody of itself. Lead in with a 15-second travelogue about Tasmania (with an Australian-accented narrator), go to Bob Costas's introduction, a feature about a little Chinese gymnast who sees her parents only twice a year, then a snippet of an actual competition, followed by a commercial and a medal ceremony for an event that was covered a half-hour ago. Throw in yet another Marion Jones profile (now with the endlessly replayed tape of her hulking, weeping, shot-putter husband, C. J. Hunter, insisting he would never disgrace his wife and kids by using banned drugs no matter what those positive tests suggest), and you have a recipe for disastrous coverage.</p>
        <p>After Cathy Freeman's gold-medal-winning race on Monday, there was a commercial, a few minutes of women's pole vaulting, then Freeman's medal ceremony. But there was a mere glimpse of her wearing both the Australian and Aboriginal flags on her victory lap, which should have provided more drama.</p>
        <p>Wait long enough and dig hard enough and you'll run across an athletic feat that is both awe-inspiring and emotional, like Laura Wilkinson's unexpected gold-medal dive. But watching television shouldn't be that much work. NBC's producers have made a mistake any music video director would have been be able to avoid: being busier doesn't make a show more interesting, just more cluttered, and the viewing experience becomes claustrophobic and annoying.</p>
        <p>NBC, of course, has to justify the $705 million it has spent for these games. It has not only spread each night's coverage over five grueling hours, it has also held several of the Americans' gold-medal winning races until after 11 p.m. In track, Marion Jones and Maurice Greene were seen winning gold medals after 11; in the men's 50-meter freestyle, in which the swimmers and training partners Gary Hall Jr. and Anthony Ervin surprisingly shared the gold medal, Costas set up the event, broke for local news, then returned for the race after 11:30.</p>
        <p>This is not some juggling act meant to accommodate East and West Coast viewers at once. The network sends three feeds to the different time zones, as with any prime-time presentation. The strategy, another backfire, is meant to lure viewers into the last hour, in which there has been a fall-off in the ratings.</p>
        <p>Making the Olympics appealing to a broader television audience is, of course, about constructing celebrities. The commentators are now dancing around the public relations damage to Jones, their best hope for stardom, and saying they hope the accusations against her husband won't be ''a distraction.''</p>
        <p>Yet even the star-making machinery is oddly out of touch, with huge streaks of lingering Cold War mentality and sexism. The American swimmer Lenny Krayzelburg is one of the most appealing personalities, low-key and modest. One of the many features about him -- born in Odessa, moved to California -- began, ''He's known life behind the Iron Curtain and in the land of opportunity.'' When is the last time you heard the term Iron Curtain used with a straight face?</p>
        <p>And after Amy van Dyken spit in Inge de Bruijn's lane, one of two male swimming commentators noted that ''Inge hissed at her like a cat.'' The other commentator said, ''I guess this is going to be a catfight.'' To the commentators, Gary Hall was cute when he taunted the Australian swimmers that he would crush them like a guitar; the women were being catty. That's not the smartest way to attract female viewers. (And NBC wonders why critics hiss at its coverage.)</p>
        <p>Viewers aren't fools. We can tell the difference between Michael Johnson's race and his commercial for a digital phone service, in which he runs with a cell phone in his hand and says, ''Hey, coach, we did it.'' But the Olympics shouldn't be so much like those familiar commercials that they are just as easy to ignore.</p>
        <p>There are alternatives. (Not the CBC's live coverage; all of Canada is not watching at 5 in the morning.) On MSNBC during the day, events like men's and women's baseball and rowing have been unfolding in a leisurely way, with fewer features, like a sports event instead of a badly packaged show.</p>
        <p>But prime time is what matters, and even though those evening ratings have crept up in the past few days, marginal improvement doesn't count for much in the midst of so much that has been botched.</p>
        <p>Even a feature about ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' was out of touch with reality. The song, the report says, ''vaporizes all cynicism.'' Have they been listening? Instead of a stirring version, the official Olympic rendition of our national anthem has a fast-paced ''Play ball!'' style.</p>
        <p>Something should be vaporized here, but it's not cynicism; the cookie cutter for this stale Olympic coverage is the thing that should vanish.</p>
