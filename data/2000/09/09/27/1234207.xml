        <p>Petr Sykora skated for the first time in a full practice with the Devils yesterday and immediately declared himself a long way from being ready. He will probably miss the season opener in 10 days.</p>
        <p>''I've got a lot of work to do,'' said Sykora, who had his tonsils removed earlier this month and who is trying to regain strength.</p>
        <p>Slava Fetisov, an assistant coach, put the 23-year-old Sykora through a grueling skate after practice at Continental Arena. ''I'm not going to rush anything,'' Sykora said. ''When I come back, I want to stay back and not pull a muscle or something.''</p>
        <p>Sykora is one of 20 players the Devils will protect from Friday's waiver draft. The only unprotected players will be Chris Ferraro and Sylvain Cloutier, both destined for the minor leagues.</p>
