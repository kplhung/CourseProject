        <p>Microsoft has long maintained that the government antitrust case would do nothing to alter its business practices or long-term strategy. And today, as it won at least a procedural victory in the case, the company had another opportunity to make its point.</p>
        <p>In recent months, Microsoft has accelerated a range of business and technical initiatives, continuing its strategy of adding software applications to its operating systems -- like the browser that brought on the antitrust scrutiny -- and moving into new computing markets ranging from the largest mainframes to the video-game business.</p>
        <p>Today, at a long-planned event, Microsoft and a group of industry partners unveiled new operating system software intended to take the company into the very high end of the corporate computing market. And Microsoft executives took the opportunity to reiterate that the antitrust suit would have no effect on the company's strategy.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the Supreme Court decision today not to take a direct appeal of the antitrust ruling, leaving it in the hands of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Steven Ballmer, Microsoft's president, said: ''I'm happy to get on with the legal process. This is really a positive procedural step forward.''</p>
        <p>The stock market initially reacted positively to the decision as well. The company's stock jumped up as much as 5 percent before settling back to close at $62.69, up 2.35 percent for the day, but still near the company's 52-week low of $60.38.</p>
        <p>While most legal experts saw the Supreme Court's decision, which could extend the legal process as much as a year, as a qualified victory for Microsoft, some noted that its effect on the company might not be entirely positive.</p>
        <p>''This is clearly a victory for Microsoft,'' said David Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor, ''because the appeals court has historically been more favorable to Microsoft.''</p>
        <p>But he and other analysts added that the decision could prolong the period of uncertainty that the company faces, leading to declining employee morale and holding down the company's stock price.</p>
        <p>''This just prolongs the agony,'' said George Colony, president of Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Mass., computer consulting firm. ''I think they should get it over fast. I'd want resolution.''</p>
        <p>Whatever agony Microsoft might be feeling two and a half years after the antitrust case was brought, it is nonetheless pushing ahead on a variety of fronts to move into new markets and consolidate existing ones.</p>
        <p>In its most ambitious strategic shift since December 1995, when it decided to ''embrace and extend'' the Internet market, the company embarked this summer on an ambitious strategy called .Net, essentially creating a set of programs resembling an operating system that will live on the Internet rather than on individual desktop computers.</p>
        <p>Then this fall the company firmed up its plans to try to compete with the video game giants Nintendo, Sega and Sony, previewing its first  Microsoft-branded computer system, the X-Box, to be available at the end of next year.</p>
        <p>Today Microsoft added the final piece of a computing strategy initially sketched out by its former chief technology officer, Nathan Myhrvold, a decade ago: to produce operating systems stretching from the smallest hand-held computers to the most powerful supercomputers.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's aggressive move into the market for large corporate computer systems, bringing it into even sharper competition with companies like I.B.M., Sun Microsystems and Oracle, is viewed as a significant transformation of the company by analysts, who said it would require a fundamental change in Microsoft's corporate culture as well.</p>
        <p>''Until now Microsoft's NT operating system has never made it into the largest enterprises,'' Mr. Colony said. ''Microsoft loved to throw software over the corporate wall and checks came back from the other side, but they never crossed over the wall to get their hands dirty.''</p>
        <p>That business approach, he said,  has been why the largest computer users, including companies like J. P. Morgan, have largely ignored Microsoft's corporate computing efforts until now.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ballmer, in an interview, said this so-called enterprise portion of Microsoft's business already represented about $4 billion of its $23 billion in annual revenue. More significant, he said, it involved between 7,500 and 8,000 of Microsoft's nearly 40,000 employees and that number is growing faster than any other part of the company's employee base -- as much as 25 percent in the next year.</p>
        <p>As for getting Microsoft's hands dirty, Mr. Ballmer said: ''I have to look at my customers and tell them that I have more skin in the game now. I have to look them in the eye and tell them, 'I'm here for you 7 by 24.' ''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Ballmer was generally bullish on the company's new push into the very highest part of the computer business, he acknowledged today that there remained some industry sectors where Microsoft would have a tough time displacing its entrenched Unix competitors like Sun and Oracle.</p>
        <p>''We're going to have quite an uphill battle in the next generation telecommunications sector,'' he said. Because there has been a strong tradition of Unix in the telecommunications network market -- one of the largest users of high-end computers -- it will be difficult for Microsoft to break in to that market, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ballmer, who took over from William H. Gates as Microsoft's chief executive earlier this year, said Mr. Gates had traveled to Sydney, Australia, to see the opening of the Olympics last week and that he was still on vacation. Mr. Gates, who remains chairman, has shifted his focus to the company's technology strategy and has taken the title of chief software architect.</p>
        <p>While Microsoft's desire for new frontiers appears to be unabated, several longtime industry executives warned that even with its dominance of operating systems and office software, the company was bumping up against real limits.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately there are only a small number of A-teams at Microsoft by definition,'' Mr. Yoffie said, ''and their ability to conquer all areas of computing is going to be difficult or impossible when they are fighting against other A-teams.''</p>
        <p>Others said the company's Achilles' heel might be that it was trying to accomplish too much, too quickly.</p>
        <p>''What I.B.M. had accomplished in 30 years Microsoft has taken on in just 6,'' said Andrew Heller, a former I.B.M. executive and computer designer. ''They haven't executed with the same level of control and process I.B.M. developed.''</p>

        <p>Events Leading Up to Supreme Court's Microsoft Ruling</p>
        <p>By The Associated Press</p>
        <p>Following are key dates in the antitrust investigation of Microsoft:</p>
        <p>OCTOBER 1997 -- The Justice Department sues Microsoft, saying it violated a 1994 consent decree by forcing computer makers to sell its Internet browser as a condition of selling its Windows software.</p>
        <p>DECEMBER 1997 -- Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of United States District Court issues a preliminary injunction forcing Microsoft to stop, at least temporarily, requiring manufacturers who sell Windows 95 ''or any successor'' to install Microsoft's Internet Explorer. The company appeals.</p>
        <p>MAY 1998 -- The Justice Department and 20 states sue Microsoft, saying it illegally thwarted competition to protect and extend its software monopoly. One state later withdraws.</p>
        <p>JUNE 23, 1998 -- A three-judge federal appeals panel removes the restrictions Judge Jackson imposed on Windows 95 software, saying there was adequate justification to bundle the Internet browser in Windows.</p>
        <p>OCT. 19, 1998 -- The antitrust trial begins, expected to last six weeks.</p>
        <p>NOV. 5, 1999 -- Judge Jackson, in preliminary findings, declares Microsoft a monopoly. He rules that the company's actions are ''stifling innovation'' and hurting consumers.</p>
        <p>NOV. 19, 1999 -- Judge Jackson appoints Richard Posner, chief judge for the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, to oversee voluntary settlement talks.</p>
        <p>APRIL 1, 2000 -- Talks between the federal government and Microsoft break down, and Judge Posner says he is ending his mediation effort.</p>
        <p>APRIL 3, 2000 -- Judge Jackson finds that Microsoft violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, ''maintained its monopoly power by anti-competitive means,'' and tried to monopolize the browser market. He also rules that it could be sued under state anti-competition laws.</p>
        <p>APRIL 28, 2000 -- The Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general ask the judge to break the company into two parts -- one to develop and market the Windows operating system and the other to develop Microsoft's other holdings.</p>
        <p>JUNE 7, 2000 -- Judge Jackson orders the breakup of Microsoft into two companies, declaring the software giant had ''proved untrustworthy in the past.'' Microsoft vows to appeal.</p>
        <p>SEPT. 26, 2000 -- Supreme Court refuses government's request for the justices to consider Microsoft's appeal directly, sending the case instead to a lower court.</p>
