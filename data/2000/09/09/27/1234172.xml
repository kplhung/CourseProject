        <p>After NBC's disappointing ratings during the first week of its Olympic coverage, it was expected that extra commercials owed to advertisers would swamp the second week, as has happened in previous Olympics.</p>
        <p>But no glut of commercials has occurred, in part because NBC chose instead to cut back on the promotional time for its network series. Indeed, in Week 2 NBC has broadcast far fewer promotional spots for its fall lineup of shows, though network executives said yesterday that the entertainment division was still comfortable with the impressions that millions of viewers were forming of the new shows by watching the Olympics broadcasts.</p>

        <p>After NBC's disappointing ratings during the first week of its Olympic coverage, it was expected that extra commercials owed to advertisers would swamp the second week, as has happened in previous Olympics.</p>
        <p>But no glut of commercials has occurred, in part because NBC chose instead to cut back on the promotional time for its network series. Indeed, in Week 2 NBC has broadcast far fewer promotional spots for its fall lineup of shows, though network executives said yesterday that the entertainment division was still comfortable with the impressions that millions of viewers were forming of the new shows by watching the Olympics broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Networks have long used big events like the Olympics to promote  their coming entertainment series, and this year has been no exception. Coming attraction for shows like ''Ed,'' ''Titans'' and ''The Michael Richards Show'' were prominent in the first week of the games.</p>
        <p>But NBC, ''looking for a way to add commercials that would not adversely affect viewers or advertisers,'' said Kassie Cantor, a corporate spokeswoman for NBC, decided to cut back the promotions this week.  She said that specific shows would still be mentioned but that the network would not be doing promotions for nightly lineups for shows.</p>
