        <p>GILLIATT-Neal. It is with profound sorrow that the Officers, Board and members of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and the UCP Research and Education Foundation acknowledge the passing of a devoted and generous friend, and Board member. He was a staunch supporter of the needs of children and adults with Cerebral Palsy for many years. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife Mary and the Gilliatt family. Leo Hausman, Chairman</p>
        <p>GILLIATT-Neal. The Manhattan Institute for Policy Research mourns the loss of a dear friend and supporter, Neal Gilliatt. Neal understood that the only way to overturn a bad idea was to put a better one in its place. Our prayers and condolences go out to his wife Mary, his son David, and all those who were, like us, touched by his exemplary life.</p>
