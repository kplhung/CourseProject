        <p>BUSINESS travelers, still toting up the fiscal and psychological costs of the summer's air-travel gridlock, are soon going to be hearing a lot more about the future promise of ''high-speed rail.''</p>
        <p>High-speed rail conjures up images of blazing bullet trains in Japan, or of the sleek 175-mile-an-hour and faster trains that now link cities in Europe on new rail-beds built for real speed. In this country, Congress is currently weighing passage of a bill that will enable the money-hemorrhaging Amtrak to borrow $10 billion for high-speed rail projects.</p>
        <p>As the lobbying to pass the bill intensifies, meanwhile, Amtrak is about to finally roll out its long-delayed $1.7 billion Acela Express high-speed rail service between New York City and Boston, which is seen as a prototype for domestic high-speed rail projects. The new train, which will be promoted as a way for business travelers to avoid the crowded skies, will reach speeds of 150 miles an hour on portions of its run.</p>
        <p>Joseph Vranich, a former Amtrak executive and a leading proponent of developing new public-private compacts to replace Amtrak and build a system of high-speed rail lines that will strategically link to the nation's air-travel system, says not so fast.</p>
        <p>He means literally not so fast, by the way. Mr. Vranich says that the new Acela Express trains are not true world-class high-speed trains and will be too slow to really compete with air shuttle service. Furthermore, he says, the overall $10 billion high-speed rail package being figuratively hauled by the new Acela Express is really a pork-barrel bonanza that will spend money on unnecessary projects and leave the United States lagging behind high-speed rail systems in Europe and Japan.</p>
        <p>''Originally, Amtrak said the Acela Express was supposed to travel between New York and Boston in 2 hours and 55 minutes, with further improvements in time,'' said Mr. Vranich, who was a member of the Congressionally appointed Amtrak Reform Council before resigning in July, asserting that Amtrak was a money pit and that the only effective reform would be to discard it.</p>
        <p>''The schedule keeps getting longer,'' Mr. Vranich said. ''The last thing I heard, it was going to be 3 hours and 15 minutes.''</p>
        <p>Actually, the new Acela Express is going to take as long as 3 hours and 20 minutes to travel between New York and Boston, said Rick Remington, an Amtrak spokesman.</p>
        <p>''Well, that's not competitive,'' Mr. Vranich argued. ''To be air-competitive on that route, you really have to come in at under three hours. The bottom line is that when the Acela Express is up and running full blast, I regret to say, not enough airline passengers will be diverted to rail.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Remington of Amtrak replied: ''Joe Vranich had the opportunity to make that argument with the Amtrak Reform Council, but chose to quit. Thirty-six states from Maine to California, on the other hand, are now working with Amtrak to expand service or invest in high-speed rail projects. The traveling public is responding with the highest ridership in Amtrak's 29-year history.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vranich, the author of ''Super-Trains: Solutions to America's Transportation Gridlock'' (St. Martin's Press, 1991), is not opposed to the Acela Express per se.</p>
        <p>''What I'm saying is Amtrak is going to be 30 years old next year. After 30 years and billions of dollars -- bottom line -- here's what we have in terms of a modern high-speed train: The Acela Express in the year 2000 will travel between New York and Boston only 40 minutes faster than the 1956 schedule between New York and Boston of the Advance Merchants Limited, a train run by the old New Haven Railroad.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Remington said that the first Acela Express trains were expected to be delivered by the end of this week and should be carrying the first passengers within a few weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vranich argued that whatever the merits of the much-heralded Acela Express, a politically beholden bureaucracy like Amtrak is incapable of planning and delivering a national network of ''true high-technology, high-speed trains that tie in with the aviation system.''</p>
        <p>The problem, he asserted, is that ''politicians all over the country are standing up to say what a wonderful thing this $10 billion high-speed rail spending bill is, because some of the money is going to be spent in their districts.'' He said the bill and other high-speed initiatives had defined ''high-speed rail'' so that much of the money would go to slower trains and what he called unnecessary long-distance rail service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vranich said true high-speed rail, requiring a new public-private- financed infrastructure and even the building of new tracks like the ones laid down in Europe to handle trains traveling at 200 miles an hour, was the smart way to plan to alleviate air-traffic strain that will only get worse in coming years, he insisted.</p>
        <p>''If all these other countries can set up viable high-speed rail systems, why can't we?'' Mr. Vranich asked.</p>
