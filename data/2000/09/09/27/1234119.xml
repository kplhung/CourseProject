        <p>In a move that was largely symbolic, Manhattan's Community School District 2 joined a handful of other groups across the nation last night in withdrawing support for the Boy Scouts of America, citing the organization's exclusion of gays.

        <p>Under the resolution, approved by six votes in favor with one abstention, scout troops would no longer be given ''special privileges, access or recruitment opportunities'' that are not offered to other groups, and no school in District 2, which includes Hell's Kitchen, Chelsea, TriBeCa, Battery Park City, Chinatown and the East Side from 14th Street to 96th Street, could sponsor Boy Scout activities.</p>

        <p>In a move that was largely symbolic, Manhattan's Community School District 2 joined a handful of other groups across the nation last night in withdrawing support for the Boy Scouts of America, citing the organization's exclusion of gays. The board urged the city's other districts and the Board of Education to follow its lead.</p>
        <p>Under the resolution, approved by six votes in favor with one abstention, scout troops would no longer be given ''special privileges, access or recruitment opportunities'' that are not offered to other groups, and no school in District 2, which includes Hell's Kitchen, Chelsea, TriBeCa, Battery Park City, Chinatown and the East Side from 14th Street to 96th Street, could sponsor Boy Scout activities.</p>
        <p>Scout troops, said Karen Feuer, the board president, would not be able to use a school's name as part of their troop name or display it on their uniform.</p>
        <p>''We're only interested in giving what I would call neutral access,'' Ms. Feuer said.</p>
        <p>But only one scout troop meets in the district, at Public School 158, said Roy Moskowitz, special counsel to the superintendent, and under the Board of Education's open-access policy, it will still be allowed to do so.</p>
        <p>Brian Ellner, a lawyer and the board member who wrote the resolution, said it was prompted by the Supreme Court's decision in June to uphold the Boy Scouts' right to exclude gays.</p>
        <p>''Essentially, for me, it was a clear call,'' he said, adding that the resolution was a way to promote a safe environment for gay and lesbian students.</p>
        <p>At the board meeting last night, the point seemed to be to send a message that discrimination would not be tolerated. ''For this board to even see this on their table is such a leap forward for the homosexual community,'' John Cassar, a high school senior, told the room.</p>
        <p>To bursts of applause, State Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick and Senator Thomas K. Duane spoke in favor of the resolution, as did former board members, a parent and several gay and lesbian students.</p>
        <p>Only one speaker, a former school board member, Delco Cornett, opposed the resolution. He accused the board, which he said was ''packed with politicians from Greenwich Village, mainly gay and lesbian,'' of ''attacking the children.''</p>
        <p>No one representing District 2's lone Scout troop spoke. Officials of the Boy Scouts of America could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Because of their policy of excluding gay men and boys, the Boy Scouts have lost private support and have come under increasing scrutiny from government entities. Chicago no longer lets the Scouts use parks, city buildings and schools free of charge, and the public schools of San Francisco no longer sponsor Scout recruitment drives or other programs during school hours.</p>
        <p>But other school board initiatives have not succeeded. On Monday, the Bethel, Ore., school board lifted a ban on Boy Scout recruiting after the board's lawyer raised questions about its constitutionality.</p>
        <p>On Long Island last summer, two school districts, fearful of being exclusionary, had protracted debates over whether to let the Scouts meet in school buildings. In the end, they allowed it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellner said he hoped District 2 would influence citywide policy. ''It's our hope that the press garnered by this issue will force the chancellor, or urge the chancellor, to consider this policy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While praising Chancellor Harold O. Levy for his ''courage and vision'' on many education issues, Mr. Ellner noted that no New York City chancellor had discussed the safety of gay and lesbian students since 1993, when Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez was forced out over his proposed Rainbow Curriculum, which included books like ''Heather Has Two Mommies.''</p>
        <p>The chancellor's legal counsel is reviewing the Board of Education's policy on the Boy Scouts, said a spokeswoman, Margie Feinberg. She said the district paid custodians $31,000 in fiscal year 1999-2000 to keep schools open during troop meetings.</p>
        <p>''Our policy is, we treat the Boy Scouts like any other community-based organization,'' she said.</p>
