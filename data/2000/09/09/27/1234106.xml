        <p>Taking up its first case on the relationship between disability law and professional sports, the Supreme Court announced today that it would decide whether the golfer Casey Martin has a legal right to use a cart rather than walk the course during PGA Tour events.</p>
        <p>The announcement was a setback for the 27-year-old Martin, who has a circulatory disorder in his right leg that makes it painful and difficult to walk any appreciable distance. After the Tour barred him in 1997 from riding a cart, saying it would give him an unfair advantage in competition, Martin sued under the Americans With Disabilities Act and won his case before two lower federal courts.</p>

        <p>Taking up its first case on the relationship between disability law and professional sports, the Supreme Court announced today that it would decide whether the golfer Casey Martin has a legal right to use a cart rather than walk the course during PGA Tour events.</p>
        <p>The announcement was a setback for the 27-year-old Martin, who has a circulatory disorder in his right leg that makes it painful and difficult to walk any appreciable distance. After the Tour barred him in 1997 from riding a cart, saying it would give him an unfair advantage in competition, Martin sued under the Americans With Disabilities Act and won his case before two lower federal courts.</p>
        <p>The PGA Tour filed a Supreme Court appeal in July, arguing that the lower courts had invoked the federal law in a context where it did not belong. ''It is essential to the nature of high-level Tour events that all competitors, without exception, play by the same rules,'' the PGA Tour said in its appeal to the justices. The court will hear the case in January and decide it by early next summer.</p>
        <p>The Americans With Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in ''any place of public accommodation.''</p>
        <p>The statute defines discrimination as ''a failure to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures'' unless those modifications ''would fundamentally alter the nature'' of the activity.</p>
        <p>Given those phrases, the Martin case presents two basic questions to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>First, is a golf course a ''place of public accommodation'' for professional golfers during a tournament? The law itself lists golf courses as examples of places of public accommodation, but the PGA Tour is arguing that the definition applies only to the spectators' areas, not to the competitors' area behind the ropes that the public has no right to enter.</p>
        <p>The second question is whether, assuming the law does apply behind the ropes, use of a cart represents such a fundamental change in the nature of the competition that it cannot be considered a ''reasonable modification.''</p>
        <p>The PGA Tour argues that walking a course four times during the four days of a tournament -- a total distance of 25 miles or more -- is itself a test of stamina and endurance that is an inherent part of the sport. The Tour told the justices that it was ''unprecedented for a federal court to order that a professional athlete be allowed to compete without adhering to the full set of substantive rules applicable to other competitors.''</p>
        <p>Martin's lawyers, not surprisingly, framed the issue quite differently. Competition in golf is shot-making, not ''a race against the clock or against human endurance,'' they told the court in their unsuccessful effort to persuade the justices not to hear the PGA Tour's appeal. ''If no rule of competition, regardless of its purpose, can be modified to permit participation by people with disabilities, then -- ironically -- sport would become the only industry in America permitted to construct barriers to access that are unrelated to performance,'' Martin's lawyers said.</p>
        <p>In ruling for Martin last March, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, noted that even with a cart, he had to walk about 25 percent of the course, because the cart often cannot be driven directly to the ball. The pain of walking that distance, as well as constantly getting in and out of the cart, meant that Martin was hardly spared the fatigue shared by golfers without his disability, the court said.</p>
        <p>Ordinarily, it would have been surprising for the Supreme Court to take up a case involving at most a handful of competitors in a single sport. But almost simultaneously with the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Martin's favor, the federal appeals court in Chicago came out the other way in a case involving Ford Olinger, a club pro from Indiana who has a degenerative hip condition. The disagreement between the two courts on the same legal issue probably persuaded the justices of the need to issue a definitive ruling.</p>
