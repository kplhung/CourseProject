        <p>House and Senate negotiators have dropped a provision in the military authorization bill that would have provided compensation for nuclear weapons workers made sick or killed by expousure to radiation or toxic chemicals, making the bill's enactment this year very uncertain.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration had een pushing for a plan, which was approved by the Senate, that would set up a program similar to workers compensation and would provide reimbursement of lost wages or $200,000, whichever is greater, plus medical expenses. But the administration did not say where the money would come from. The House Judiciary Committee favored a plan that offered $100,000 plus health care costs.</p>
        <p>John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said that the House's last position had been to provide $250 million to start the compensation process but that the Senate wanted more. ''They were pushing for an entitlement program, and who knows what final cost would have been, the multiple billions, probably,'' Mr. Feehery said.</p>
        <p>Dr. David Michaels, the assistant secretary for environment and health of the Energy Department,  said that such estimates were ''outrageous exaggerations.''</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office projects a cost of just under $1 billion in the first five years, and cases are emerging at a rate of 50 to 100 a year, Dr. Michaels said.</p>
        <p>He said the payments would have to be made under an entitlement program, just as workers compensation payments are made. ''You can't start paying in one year and stop the next year because you run out of money,'' he said. The administraiton is still trying to get a compensation provision into the bill.</p>
        <p>Representative Ted Strickland, Democrat of Ohio, whose district includes a uranium processing plant, said, ''it is almost incomprehensible that people could be so hard-hearted and heartless.''</p>
        <p>The administration said early this year, for the first time, that nuclear weapons manufacturing had caused illness and premature death in some of the 600,000 people employed for it.</p>
