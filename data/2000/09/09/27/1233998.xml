        <p>Steak and More Steak</p>
        <p>It's a big week for steakhouses. Rothmann's, a venerable Long Island restaurant, has opened its first branch, Rothmann's Steakhouse and Grill, at 3 East 54th Street, in partnership with the Sbarro Group. There's no mistaking the steakhouse look. With this much leather, wood paneling and buffed brass, it's thoroughly corporate. Along with meat, the menu features fish.</p>
        <p>Nick &amp; Stef's Steakhouse, a branch of the restaurant owned by Joachim and Christine Splichal in Los Angeles (and named after their twin sons), opens on Friday at 9 Penn Plaza, adjacent to Madison Square Garden. The menu has a dozen appetizers and an equal number of meats, sauces, potato dishes and vegetables for mixing and matching.</p>

        <p>Speaking of Meat</p>
        <p>Macelleria means butcher shop in Italian, and the word suits a new restaurant by that name in the meatpacking district, at 48 Gansevoort Street (Washington Street). Violetta Bitici and her father, Sergio, the former owner of Toscana, have converted a wholesale meat operation, keeping the racks and hooks in place, into a haven for the Austrian-accented cuisine of northeast Italy.</p>
        <p>Chef on the Move</p>
        <p>Georges Masraff, who had been at Windows on the World, is now the chef at the Lenox Room on the Upper East Side.</p>
