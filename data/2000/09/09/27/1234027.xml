        <p>Last summer, just hours before she was to make her Tanglewood debut as soloist in the Brahms Violin Concerto, Joan Kwuon, a Los Angeles-born violinist, discovered a lump in her breast. Subsequent consultations confirmed that Ms. Kwuon had cancer. She was only 30.</p>
        <p>She began treatments. But that was not all. Ms. Kwuon and her husband, Joel Smirnoff, the violinist of the Juilliard String Quartet, founded Artists for Breast Cancer Survival, a nonprofit organization to support research and treatment.</p>
        <p>Thanks to early detection of her case and medical attention, particularly from Dr. Anne Moore of the New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, Ms. Kwuon is doing very well. As a tribute to Dr. Moore, and to bring attention to their work, Ms. Kwuon and Mr. Smirnoff presented ''Artists for the Cure,'' a benefit concert for the Weill center on Friday night at Carnegie Hall, with the actor and singer Mandy Patinkin as host. More than $250,000 was raised, and Dr. Moore was deservedly honored.</p>
        <p>The evening began with Mozart's ebullient Piano Quartet in E flat performed by Mr. Smirnoff and two colleagues from the Juilliard Quartet, the violist Samuel Rhodes, the cellist Joel Krosnick and Andre Previn at the piano. The final work was Mozart's Violin Concert No. 3, with Mr. Previn conducting the Prometheus Chamber Orchestra and Ms. Kwuon, looking radiant, as the soloist.</p>
        <p>Speaking of radiance, the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves offered her signature aria, the ''Habanera'' from Bizet's ''Carmen.'' Then grabbing a microphone, she switched modes and sang a beguiling performance of Harold Arlen's ''Blues in the Night.''</p>
        <p>The contributions of two other participants had special poignancy because of their personal stories. Jane Monheit, a gifted jazz and cabaret singer, accompanied by a jazz trio, sang the standard ''My Foolish Heart'' and also Bernstein's ''Some Other Time'' from ''On the Town. Saying ''this is the most important performance of my life,'' she dedicated the songs to her mother, a breast cancer survivor, who was in the audience.</p>
        <p>The soprano Evelyn Lear, about to celebrate her 75th birthday, sang ''I'm Still Here,'' the heart-rending anthem of a former chorus girl, from Stephen Sondheim's ''Follies.'' Halfway through the song, as the pianist Stephen Blier continued to play quietly, Ms. Lear, like a veteran nightclub singer, shared her own story with the audience. In 1985, after her farewell performance at the Metropolitan Opera, she was looking forward to slowing down and spoiling her grandchildren, she said. But Ms. Lear's golden years have been shaken by her bout with breast cancer. After a double mastectomy and arduous treatments, she seems to have beaten the disease, which gave a special resonance to her spunky delivery of lyrics like: ''Good times and bum times,/I've seen them all and, my dear,/I'm still here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Patinkin, who sang a sweetly wistful rendition of ''Over the Rainbow'' to cap the night, was an ideal host, full of humor, tough talk and feisty optimism about the battle against breast cancer. In a powerful demonstration of the impact of the disease, he asked groups of affected audience members to stand in turn: first breast cancer survivors, then all those who have had a family member with the disease, then those who have had a close friend contract breast cancer. By the end, there was hardly a person seated anywhere in Carnegie Hall.</p>
