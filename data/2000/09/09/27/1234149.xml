        <p>The tightening presidential race makes it all the more important for Americans to take a close look at Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore at their first debate next Tuesday night. For the NBC and Fox networks, however, baseball and commercial interests appear to be more important than the presidential debates.</p>
        <p>NBC has decided not to run the debate the first night and to go instead with a baseball playoff game -- and a league championship game, if there is one, on the night of the last debate on Oct. 17. Fox plans to snub the debate in favor of a new science-fiction adventure series produced by James Cameron of ''Titanic.''</p>
        <p>NBC notes that it has a contract with Major League Baseball to show the game. But this is the same network that was negotiating with the Bush campaign a few weeks ago to pass over the presidential debate commission and broadcast a debate session exclusively, so surely it can be inventive about finding a way to fulfill its civic obligation. For both NBC and Fox, that means carrying the debates live, facilitating programming that produces the largest possible national audience. In the past such debates, simultaneously broadcast on all major networks, have drawn as many as 90 million viewers. The networks' duty is to serve that wide spectrum of the American public rather than their own commercial interests for just a few nights every four years.</p>
