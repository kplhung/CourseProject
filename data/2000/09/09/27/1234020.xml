        <p>Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana of the United States are leaving Bondi Beach with ''some Australian sand in our ears'' and, more surprisingly, as winners of a sparkling gold medal each for the United States in men's beach volleyball.</p>
        <p>The two Southern Californians, professionals conditioned on their sport's showbiz-style commercial circuit, were in tears and near emotional collapse after defeating Ze Marco de Melo and Ricardo Santos of Brazil in what is considered one of the fledgling sport's biggest upsets.</p>
        <p>Coming here as fringe qualifiers for the United States squad, ranked 11th of the 24 competing teams and facing opponents rated as near the world's best, Blanton and Fonoimoana won the first set of today's final, 12-11, after surviving four set points. Then they clinched gold with a 12-9 decision in a marathon second set in which 21 of its 66 minutes went scoreless.</p>
        <p>After the final winning cut shot by Blanton, the Americans collapsed on the damp sand of Bondi Beach in a long hug to the cheers and chants of 10,000 fervent spectators soaked by showers but warmed by the memorable underdog triumph.</p>
        <p>''You'd have to call this a complete upset, based on the records,'' Blanton said.</p>
        <p>The 29-year-old Blanton and his partner of three seasons, Fonoimoana, 31, tried to put their unlikely victory into words after receiving their gold medals from the International Olympic Committee's president, Juan Antonio Samaranch.</p>
        <p>''In this meet, we put together the best five games we've played,'' Blanton said. ''We managed to do our best when the best was needed. To win you have to dig deep, and we did.''</p>
        <p>Samaranch watched the final through a steady drizzle. It was the last match of an enormously popular Olympic beach volleyball tournament that included competitors from 17 nations.</p>
        <p>For the Brazilians, whose country considers the game second only to soccer as a national sport, the loss was no less emotional, particularly because its top women lost to Australia on Monday in another gold medal upset.</p>
        <p>After that shock defeat, the Brazilian women wept. The Brazilian men put on a braver face.</p>
        <p>''We wanted gold,'' de Melo said. ''We are smiling on the outside but inside we are crying.''</p>
