        <p>Ms. Reno</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from the testimony of Attorney General Janet Reno and Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, yesterday at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the case of Wen Ho Lee, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno</p>
        <p>Director Freeh and I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to tell you what we did in the case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee and why we did it.</p>
        <p>At the outset, I must caution that we're limited in what we can discuss here. The government has secured a commitment from Dr. Lee to cooperate and to submit to a comprehensive debriefing in the next few weeks and further inquiries for some months after that. We do not, and I am sure you do not, want to do or say anything here that would interfere with the debriefing. Some issues may also require that we go into closed session. . . .</p>
        <p>As attorney general and as director of the F.B.I., Director Freeh and I share together an awesome responsibility to protect the national security of this nation, but at the same time to protect the Constitution and the rights of all Americans. These cases are difficult without full access to the facts, and given some of the rumors and speculations that have been reported in the press, I can understand that questions arise. But I hope that by the end of our session today you will agree that our actions made sense, were reasonable and were correct.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee is no hero. He is not an absent-minded professor. He is a felon. He committed a very serious, calculated crime, and he pled guilty to it. He abused the trust of the American people by putting at risk some of our core national security secrets. He had one of the highest security clearance levels possible, granting him access to the most sensitive of nuclear weapons information. He had worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory for 20 years. He had access to the Los Alamos computer system that was designed precisely to be secure against unauthorized intrusions.</p>
        <p>What was on that secure system? Nuclear weapon design and testing data that is in effect the library of blueprints of most of the United States nuclear weapons designs, designs that are the fruit of the investment of hundreds of billions of dollars. Dr. Lee systematically, deliberately moved nuclear weapons data that was not even related to the work he was doing. He moved it from the system where it was safe and secure to a vulnerable computer in the Los Alamos system that any hacker or foreign government could penetrate. Dr. Lee did so by betraying the trust that had been placed in him to protect those secrets.</p>
        <p>The process of transferring this data took Dr. Lee a long time, nearly 40 hours over a 70-day period. As has been pointed out, it involved the equivalent of 400,000 pages. Stacked up, that's a 13-story building. He left this information that is so vital to our national security on that unsecure computer, not for hours or days or even months. He left it there for years. He knew that it was classified. He knew that what he was doing was wrong. He moved files in such a way as to defeat security measures he knew were in place. He went further. He copied the information from the unsecure computer onto 10 portable tapes. Three were recovered by the F.B.I., seven are missing. What's more, he made copies of the portable tapes and those copies are also missing. When Dr. Lee found out he was being investigated, he took steps to cover up his actions. After his access was revoked to the part of the lab where the secure computer resided, he tried over and over again to get in, including at 3:30 a.m. on one Christmas Eve.</p>
        <p>Despite what you read in the papers, until he entered the plea agreement Dr. Lee never had said he would admit his wrongdoing, plead guilty to a felony and tell us what he did with the tape. The plea agreement entered into by the government with Dr. Lee is our best chance to find out what happened to the computer tapes containing some of the nation's most important nuclear designs and testing information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh</p>
        <p>As an expert from Los Alamos testified in this case, the material downloaded and copied represented the complete nuclear weapons design capability of Los Alamos at that time -- 50 years of nuclear weapons development at the expense of hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Quoting from Dr. Younger: These codes and their associated databases and the input file combined with someone that knew how to use them could, in my opinion, in the wrong hands, change the global strategic balance. They enable the possessor to design the only objects that could result in the military defeat of America's conventional forces. The only threat, for example, to our carrier battle groups. They represent the gravest possible security risk to the United States.</p>
        <p>Before he created the tapes, only two sites in the world held this complete design portfolio: Division X at Los Alamos and another national laboratory.</p>
        <p>Now, many have asked if his conduct was so bad, why did the government negotiate a plea agreement and agree to release him. Fair question. Understandable.</p>
        <p>But it has a very simple answer: Department of Justice and the F.B.I. concluded that this guilty plea, coupled with his agreement to submit to questioning under oath and to a polygraph, was our best opportunity to protect the national security by finding out what happened to the seven missing tapes. And we found out, on the way to the courthouse, the additional copies of tapes which he has now admitted to having made.</p>
        <p>This was always the object of this investigation and prosecution: Why did he make them? Where are they? What happened to them? And who had access to them?</p>
        <p>From the moment we learned last year that our nation's nuclear secrets were on missing portable tapes, we have had this central goal: to find out what happened to them. This was the goal of the entire national security leadership of our government, not just the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice.</p>
        <p>Before any charges were brought against Dr. Lee, this matter was analyzed by the highest levels of our government. Working together we carefully considered the substantial risks to our national security of proceeding with the public prosecution counterbalanced against the risks of forgoing the prosecution.</p>
        <p>In the end there was a consensus that a criminal prosecution of Dr. Lee presented the best opportunity for discovering where the tapes were, why he made them and who, if anyone else, had access to them.</p>
        <p>The decision to prosecute Dr. Lee was made only after repeated attempts to gain his cooperation before indictment. . . .</p>
        <p>I would now like to address the disturbing allegations that the government engaged in selective prosecution or racial profiling in its investigation and prosecution of Dr. Lee.</p>
        <p>There is simply no truth to these allegations. Dr. Lee was not investigated nor indicted nor incarcerated because he is an American of Asian decent.</p>
        <p>As the attorney general and the director of the F.B.I., we are honored to head organizations that pride themselves with fair and impartial law enforcement. We would never tolerate racial profiling or selective prosecution.</p>
