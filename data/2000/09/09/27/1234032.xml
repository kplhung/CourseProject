        <p>David Bett, an art director for a hip-hop music label, drove to the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Saturday with his wife and three children, playing L. L. Cool J on the car stereo to prepare them for what they were about to witness.</p>
        <p>Orvil M. Minott, 24, a rock and hip-hop musician, walked to the museum with a group of ''at risk'' teenagers he works with at a nonprofit group in nearby Flatbush. And Joe Correale, 28, who as a teenager in the Bronx took part in ''park jams,'' where D.J.'s and M.C.'s spun the first fledgling raps, arrived by subway to see how his borough's history was being displayed.</p>
        <p>The patrons of the Brooklyn Museum's new exhibition, ''Hip-Hop Nation: Roots, Rhymes and Rage,'' listening to rap music in educational kiosks, watching videos about subway graffiti artists and marveling over the enormity of the rap star Biggy Small's sweatsuit, looked markedly different from the museum's typical weekend crowd. They were younger and more ethnically diverse, and a striking number said they had a personal connection to the material on display, whether they were record company executives, former graffiti writers, young aspiring D.J.'s or teenagers who simply said they had never known life without hip-hop.</p>
        <p>And although many praised the museum for presenting the show, the first of its kind in a major American museum, and said they enjoyed its vitality and its comprehensive approach to the music, some walked out with the lingering feeling that the hip-hop they saw on the walls was quite different from the hip-hop they knew from the streets.</p>
        <p>The show, originally mounted by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland and changed only minimally (a few graffiti art pieces were added) by Kevin Stayton, a curator at the Brooklyn Museum, was sponsored in part by Def Jam Records. It features hundreds of items -- including rappers' clothes, concert posters and historical memorabilia linking hip-hop to older cultural touchstones -- and several video displays, all in four galleries on the first floor. The exhibition focuses primarily on music icons and commercial aspects of the culture, but is tame in its approach, presenting some information on gangsta rap without addressing  the harsh lyrics and videos that have given rap its troublesome reputation.</p>
        <p>But because there was little material about break-dancing and only a handful of graffiti paintings, some patrons said they were disappointed that the exhibition did not reflect more deeply the various forms that gave birth to the genre.</p>
        <p>''Especially right here in our neighborhood, I was hoping it would be something we could come to and feel connected to,'' Mr. Minott said. ''But I don't feel connected. This is giving us the glamour of hip-hop, but it doesn't give any of the political message and the political struggle that the music is about.''</p>
        <p>That view was echoed by other artists who consider themselves part of hip-hop's history. Aaron Goodstone, 34, who has been a graffiti artist for 20 years and goes by the name Sharp, said that the exhibition placed too much emphasis on music and did not adequately represent the two other essential components of the culture, the visual arts and dance.</p>
        <p>''It was all focused on people who rap,'' Mr. Goodstone said. ''I think it's so unfair that because rap is already an industry, all the other people who contributed to the movement and the arts in it were cast in shadow behind the rappers.''</p>
        <p>But others said they felt that the exhibition paid appropriate homage to the pioneers of the genre, highlighting the links to jazz musicians like Cab Calloway, funk artists like George Clinton and spoken-word innovators like the Last Poets.</p>
        <p>''They definitely kept it real,'' said Courtney E. Beatty, 26, a warehouse foreman from Amityville, N.Y., who is a hip-hop M.C. and music producer in his spare time. ''Especially where they went to the old school, like Kurtis Blow and Grandmaster Flash. They took us back to the roots, and that was cool.''</p>
        <p>There was also much debate about the kind of audience the exhibition  was intended to attract.</p>
        <p>Alex Reyes, a musician and graphic designer from Los Angeles who goes by the name Sketch, said that the show was a primer on hip-hop culture, touching on only its most basic aspects.</p>
        <p>''It's oriented for a mainstream viewer -- who's popular now, who's making money,'' he said. ''But I would have liked to see alternative artists mentioned, people who really made an impact in creating the culture.''</p>
        <p>But others who consider themselves mainstream viewers, like Jan Girard, 54, a home furnishings designer from the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, said they thought that the exhibition was created with hip-hop fans in mind.</p>
        <p>''I'm probably too old for this,'' she said. ''I think it was more about people who are already familiar with it.'' Ms. Girard said she took her friend and her friend's teenage son to the museum because it was one exhibition she knew the boy could tolerate.</p>
        <p>Roberto Resto, 19, a high school student from Williamsburg, was thrilled to find an exhibition he could relate to. ''It's definitely cool, because I've never seen anything like this in a museum before,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bett, who has designed several covers for rap albums in the past, said he thought the subject matter was tame enough for his children and unlikely to spawn the kind of conflict stirred last year by ''Sensation,'' the Brooklyn Museum's exhibition of works by young British artists that included animals suspended in formaldehyde and an image of the Virgin Mary decorated with bits of cow dung.</p>
        <p>''This is trying to be very positive,'' he said. ''Hip-hop is so deep, it's hard to get into all of it, and so much of it is still underground. For mainstream hip-hop, it does a good job.''</p>
        <p>Yet the dearth of controversial material and the abundance of commercial artifacts in the show upset some viewers. Miguel Nogueres, 33, an art director for an advertising agency from the Pelham Bay section of the Bronx, said he grew up in the Throgs Neck public housing projects, where he had a front row seat on the emergence of hip-hop culture in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>''I guess it's not as intimidating now as it used to be,'' he said. ''People thought it belonged to gangsters and drug dealers, though it never really did. It was a form of expression, language and art and dance. I don't really think clothing and photographs will ever do it justice, because it's such a lively and energetic form. This exhibit is like one color in the palette of hip-hop.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 28, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about viewers' responses to the ''Hip-Hop Nation'' exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum of Art referred incorrectly to materials used by the artist Chris Ofili for his collage of the Virgin Mary in the museum's recent show ''Sensation.'' Along with paper, oil paint, glitter and resin, the artist used elephant dung, not cow dung.</p>
