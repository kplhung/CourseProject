        <p>Corning Inc., the leading supplier of glass fiber, is expected to announce today that it has agreed to acquire the fiber-optic telecommunications business of Pirelli S.p.A., the Italian tire and cable maker, for about $3 billion, people close to the negotiations said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The sale comes amid mounting pressure to consolidate in the fiber-optic components industry after JDS Uniphase bought SDL for $41 billion in July, making it the leader in the field.</p>
        <p>The deal helps round out Corning's product line and allows Pirelli to exit a highly competitive part of the fiber optics business that it has struggled in against much larger rivals.</p>
        <p>The transaction will be all or mostly in cash, the executives said.</p>
        <p>Shares of Pirelli and its parent companies, Pirelli &amp; Company and Camfin S.p.A., were suspended yesterday in Italy because of speculation about an impending deal. News of a deal between Corning and Pirelli was reported on The Wall Street Journal Web site.</p>
        <p>Corning, once known primarily for housewares, left that business three years ago to focus on high-technology businesses like photonics -- the lasers, amplifiers and filters that blast signals down the fiber optic pipelines of modern telecommunications.</p>
        <p>Its entry may have been in glass fibers, but Corning has been on a buying spree lately, spending more than $6 billion on acquisitions in the last year as the company has become the leading supplier of optical amplifiers, cables and fibers.</p>
        <p>At the end of July, Corning discussed acquiring the fiber optics business of Nortel Networks in a deal that could have been worth more than $100 billion. That deal was abandoned after the market pummeled shares of the companies.</p>
        <p>Pirelli has also been on its own deal spree, selling its terrestrial optical systems unit and a 10 percent stake in its optical components and submarine optical systems units to Cisco Systems for $2.2 billion last year.</p>
