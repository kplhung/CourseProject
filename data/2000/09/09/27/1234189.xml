        <p>As the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, husband of Marion Jones, denies that he knowingly took banned substances, the entire system of drug testing in the United States has come under fire from the international Olympic hierarchy. These international officials consider the Americans hypocritical, laggard and deceptive in their handling of doping cases.</p>
        <p>United States officials are firing back in what has become the newest Olympic sport: verbal skeet shooting. The recrimination has symbolized the messy state of drug testing and the lack of trust and cooperation undermining renewed efforts to curb the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
        <p>For years, members of the International Olympic Committee have suspected that American officials have been covering up positive drug tests, even as the Americans have criticized the international committee for its own deficiencies and lack of willpower to catch cheating athletes.</p>
        <p>Over the past two years, the I.O.C. has absorbed a battering from Congress, the White House, corporate sponsors and the news media on the issues of corruption in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and of its suspect resolve on doping.</p>
        <p>On Monday, a published report here said that Hunter had tested positive for the steroid nandrolone in July in Oslo, and the I.O.C. was quick to confirm the story. Today, the committee said that Hunter had tested positive four times this summer for the steroid.</p>
        <p>Jones, who is the United States' top shot-putter but did not compete here because of a knee injury, is also the husband of Jones, the most visible American athlete at these Olympics. She has won a gold at 100 meters and is going for four others on the track.</p>
        <p>The I.O.C. made Hunter's case an issue and sent a harsh message to United States Olympic and track officials: Don't complain about the rest of the world until you address your own problems.</p>
        <p>''We feel, yes, it's O.K. to criticize,'' said Gerhard Heiberg, an International Olympic Committee delegate from Norway. ''At the same time we feel your house is not in order. We feel you do not tell us the truth what is happening in the United States. You want us to be open instead of sweeping everything under the carpet. That has to go for the U.S. as well. We're a little irritated.''</p>
        <p>Hunter said today that he had not taken any performance-enhancing steroids. He said that nutritional supplements, which he called improperly labeled and packaged with quality-control problems, had led to the positive drug tests.</p>
        <p>However, athletes are warned repeatedly by the United States Olympic Committee and by the national governing bodies of various sports not to take nutritional supplements for this very reason.</p>
        <p>The supplements are classified as food and not as a drug, and as such are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. Steroids, which can improve performance by allowing athletes to train harder, can legally be sold in supplements even if not labeled, as long as no medical claim is made, said Dr. Don Catlin, who operates the Olympic drug-testing lab at U.C.L.A. and is a member of the I.O.C.'s doping agency.</p>
        <p>At the Olympics, if an athlete takes a banned substance, he can be suspended, even if the substance was ingested inadvertently. Andreea Raducan was stripped of her gold medal in the gymnastics' all-around competition today after she had tested positive for a banned stimulant included in a cold medicine given to her by the Romanian team doctor.</p>
        <p>Nandrolone, for which Hunter tested positive, has been easily detectable for many years. Recently, though, the steroid has been showing up in a number of positive tests involving high-profile athletes. Improperly labeled nutritional supplements may have caused the positive tests, but that does not exonerate the athletes, scientists said. ''It's buyer beware,'' Catlin said. ''If it's in your body, you take responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Also at issue is why Hunter's positive tests were not revealed until now. The International Amateur Athletic Federation, which governs track and field, says Hunter was suspended on Aug. 24, yet USA Track and Field has yet to make that announcement, which some have found to be misleading.</p>
        <p>Dr. Arne Ljungqvist, an I.O.C. delegate from Sweden and the chief medical officer of track and field's world governing body, has criticized the United States track federation for what he called a failure to report in a timely manner 12 to 15 positive drug tests over the past two years.</p>
        <p>Not all criticism of American drug-testing procedures has come from outside the United States. Dr. Robert S. Voy and Dr. Wade Exum, the U.S.O.C.'s past two medical directors, have censured the Olympic committee for what they say is a lack of resolve in catching drug cheats. Exum claims in a lawsuit that as many as half of the American athletes who have tested positive in recent years have gone unpunished.</p>
        <p>The U.S.O.C. has denied the allegation. It will, however, have its drug testing conducted by an independent agency after these Games. Dick Pound, a member of the I.O.C. executive board and the chairman of its World Anti-Doping Agency, suggested that if the United States Olympic Committee were serious, it would have begun independent testing before the Sydney Olympics, not after.</p>
        <p>''This is not the right kind of signal for a leader to be sending,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The attack on the Americans has caused United States officials to respond with equally caustic remarks. Prince Alexandre de Merode of Belgium, the I.O.C.'s medical director, has said that five American athletes were permitted to compete at the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea, after testing positive before those Games. Mike Moran, a U.S.O.C. spokesman, said that all disputed cases had been investigated at the time and that all athletes in question had been exonerated. The charge of a cover-up was outrageous, he said.</p>
        <p>Craig Masback, chief executive of the United States track and field federation, met with Pound here today to express his displeasure with the way his federation had been portrayed as behaving improperly in handling doping matters.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Masback said USA Track and Field had been the world's first sports federation to conduct out-of-competition testing and had conducted more tests for more substances and caught more cheats than any other federation.</p>
        <p>He said that USA Track and Field was making an honest effort in a flawed system: labs do not report results for up to eight weeks and forward insufficient paperwork; tests are sometimes improperly conducted; organizations such as the U.S.O.C. and track and field's world governing body do not conduct follow-up investigations of suspicious tests for months or years; drug testing does not always withstand legal scrutiny; the I.O.C.-accredited labs rely on various Olympic bodies for financing, and lab directors are reluctant to testify against the shoddy work of other labs for fear that they will lose income from drug-testing referrals.</p>
        <p>If the Americans cannot be trusted, Masback said, then the agency created by the International Olympic Committee or track and field's world governing body should begin administering all drug tests for the American federation. ''Let them see the frailties of the system,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Masback said that the 12 to 15 tests under discussion had been conducted at an I.O.C.-accredited lab in Indianapolis. The lab, however, apparently was not simultaneously notifying the various sports bodies -- the United States and International Olympic Committees and the international and American track and field federations -- of positive results, as is required, Masback said.</p>
        <p>Three or four athletes were exonerated because when their urine samples were divided into halves for testing, one half tested positive while the other tested negative. A failed test is not declared unless both the so-called A and B samples test positive.</p>
        <p>The remaining sticking point between USA Track and Field and the international federation involves confidentiality. The American system states that an athlete will not be suspended, or his name forwarded to the I.A.A.F. and made public, until after the A and B samples are tested and a lengthy set of appeals is exhausted -- as long as four years.</p>
        <p>This is too long, according to the I.A.A.F., which suspends athletes after the A sample is declared positive. The international federation is also demanding to see test results involving American athletes who have been cleared by the United States federation so that cover-ups can be detected if they occur.</p>
