        <p>The playoff dreams of the MetroStars grew more distant tonight as the Chicago Fire snatched a 3-0 victory in front of a crowd announced at 7,141 at Soldier Field.</p>
        <p>In the first game of a three-game semifinal series, the Fire powered past the MetroStars behind first-half goals from Hristo Stoitchkov and Dema Kovalenko. The MetroStars dropped to 1-3 this year against the Fire and lost 3 points in the playoff series.</p>
        <p>The Major League Soccer playoffs work on a point system, with teams taking 3 for a victory and 1 for a draw; the first team to accumulate 5 points in the three-game series will advance to the finals Oct. 15 in Washington against the winner of the Los Angeles-Kansas City series.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars' next game will be at 6 p.m. Saturday at Giants Stadium. If a third game is necessary, it will be played Oct. 6 at Soldier Field.</p>
        <p>The tough but clean game belied the history between the two clubs: MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano and his Chicago counterpart, Bob Bradley, have no love lost between them. Their last meeting, in May at the Meadowlands, was the site not only of the Fire's worst defeat of the season, 4-1, but also of a bench-clearing brawl that left Zambrano claiming that a Fire assistant coach had hit him.</p>
        <p>But if the MetroStars were motivated by the bad blood, they did not get a chance to show it. Chicago played a clinical game that utterly shut the MetroStars down despite the Fire's loss of its captain, Peter Nowak, to a hamstring injury. Despite finding some stride late in the second half, it was too little, too late.</p>
        <p>''I can't put my finger on what went wrong tonight,'' Zambrano said. ''We were just not in the game in the first half. I had thought this would have been a tough match with battles all over the field, but instead we gave them too much respect.</p>
        <p>''We had our chances, and we missed them. After that, it was garbage time.''</p>
        <p>Using Stoitchkov in the playmaking role, the Fire unleashed a flurry of dynamic attacks that kept the MetroStars' defenders on their heels.</p>
        <p>Reversing the game plan that had served them so well in a first-round series against New England, the Fire chose to swing the ball to its opponents' left side and then attempt to score on the cross back. Chicago, which has been so effective in running straight at the right side with the speed that Ante Razov and Stoitchkov possess, was clearly looking to bypass Mike Petke, who has been one of the few defenders to keep pace with the Fire.</p>
        <p>It worked; both goals came off crosses from the left side.</p>
        <p>The first goal came on a play on which it seemed certain the MetroStars would  score: Fire defender Carlos Bocanegra was carded for tripping Billy Walsh just outside the box and Clint Mathis, who has been a scoring tear, teed up the free kick brilliantly only to see Zach Thornton make an equally brilliant diving save to keep things level.</p>
        <p>But on the ensuing corner kick, Thornton collected the ball and fired it out to a running DaMarcus Beasley. Beasley slotted the ball forward to Kovalenko, unmarked on the right side of the 18-yard box. Kovalenko slipped the ball past Petke to find a sliding Stoitchkov, and just like that, the MetroStars were in the hole, 1-0.</p>
        <p>Kovalenko exploited the MetroStars again in the 35th minute when Chris Armas stole a ball at midfield and headed it on to Jesse Marsch, who slotted it right across the goal mouth. Kovalenko made a solid run onto the ball to make it 2-0. As planned, Petke was not a factor on either play.</p>
        <p>While the MetroStars attempted to ratchet up the pressure with a halftime substitution of Roy Myers for Thomas Dooley, they rarely threatened. The Fire, employing the bunkering tactics that Zambrano has openly derided, kept the pace up with a series of lightning counters that blunted any momentum the MetroStars could assemble.</p>
        <p>Petke had one of the only solid offensive chances for the MetroStars, a header that was just cleared off the line by Armas at the 60-minute mark.</p>
