        <p>Not every pedestrian on Washington Street here sees an apparition of the Virgin Mary in the smudgy colored streaks of the thermal pane window.</p>
        <p>But just as in the miracles frequently reported in small Southern towns, or the one that played out for months in a suburban yard in Marlboro, N.J.,  a few years back, none of the faithful here are demanding unanimity.</p>
        <p>The streaks in the window, in Ramona and Marcelino Collado's second-floor apartment, started changing colors and producing an image last week, family members said, and the  Collados' apartment was transformed into a religious shrine.</p>
        <p>Today, hundreds of people came to their working-class, Hispanic neighborhood and stood in the rain, peering up at the window. Some squinted,  struggling to discern an image that others, their lips moving in apparent prayer, had already perceived. Others climbed the stairs to the apartment and trooped through the Collados'  kitchen and living room in soggy shoes to pay homage at the window.</p>
        <p>Some knelt in the living room to pray beneath a large framed picture of Christ. Some said the rosary. Others walked to the window and pressed their hands to the glass. One elderly man rubbed a candle against it.</p>
        <p>The Collado family welcomed all, most of them strangers. Some visitors brought candles that were placed on a table beneath the window. Others came with bouquets of roses.</p>
        <p>Two teachers' aides on their lunch break from a local elementary school  pressed their hands to the window and came away in silence.</p>
        <p>''I think most want to believe, that's why we're here,'' said one, Maria Tirado. ''It's very mystical. You just have to believe.''</p>
        <p>Her colleague, Patricia DeFex, said: ''Anything is possible if you have faith. If it is true and you've touched it, you've touched something holy, like a relic.''</p>
        <p>Jose Rivas, 32, of nearby Carteret, stood in the living room, clutching a crucifix attached to a gold chain. ''I find it to be breathtaking,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To the uninitiated, the living room window facing Washington Street  seems nothing more than a blur of discoloration. The colors take on different hues, depending on the viewing angle from the sidewalk. From  the right, the streaks have a reddish-orange tint; from the front, white and brown; and from the left, grayish-green with a flame-shaped trace of red in the lower left corner.</p>
        <p>From indoors, the double-paned window exhibits none of the streakiness. It appears misty or covered with steam.</p>
        <p>For now, the Roman Catholic Church is saying nothing about the window. Rayanne Damiano, a spokeswoman for the Diocese of Metuchen, which includes Perth Amboy, said the diocese had no official comment. She said the bishop, Vincent D. P. Breen and all diocesan priests were at a three-day retreat and not available for questions. They had left instructions, she said, not to discuss the window.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, as visitors filled the family living room, the Collados' son-in-law, Felix Pratts, said that the window began changing colors last Tuesday or Wednesday. At first, he said, his wife, Isaura, thought her mother had put a religious picture in the window and it had somehow left an impression on the glass. But when she learned that nothing had been put in the window, she began thinking that the window bore an image of  Mary and she began sharing those thoughts with neighbors.</p>
        <p>Word spread fast through Perth Amboy and surrounding parts of Middlesex County. Strangers began turning up Friday, some with candles, to gaze at the window and pray. Crowds grew through the weekend, and the turnout Monday, which included film crews from New York television stations, was so large that the Perth Amboy police closed Washington Street to all vehicles from 1 to 8 p.m. The crowd was sparser in the rain today. But in the early afternoon, cars crept by, bumper to bumper, their occupants straining for a glimpse of the window. Four police officers kept onlookers and visitors behind barricades on either side of the street. Those eager to go upstairs lined up silently in the rain.</p>
        <p>Some neighbors watched from front porches. They did not seem upset by all the strangers.</p>
        <p>Michael Felicis, who lives next to the Collados, said: ''To us, it's not a problem. We're happy with this.''</p>
        <p>Another neighbor, Vincent Alba, 71, said some people on the street were upset late last week, ''but now they're resigned to this.'' He said he did not mind the commotion if some drew religious strength from it.</p>
        <p>One of today's visitors, Laraine Colucci, 60, of North Plainfield, N.J., said she believed the window held the same image that Juan Diego, an Aztec convert to Christianity, saw in the hills outside Mexico City in 1531: the Virgin of Guadalupe.</p>
        <p>Ms. Colucci said she was hospitalized by a stroke for seven days last year.</p>
        <p>''It was through her intercession that I made a complete recovery,'' she said. ''I have a tremendous amount of devotion and I wanted to be a part of this. I think there's a message that has to be brought to the people. Look at the way the world is going -- God wants his people back.''</p>
        <p>Like others who came today, Mr. Rivas, the visitor from Carteret, said he was struck that the window displayed colors from the outside and yet looked only misty from inside the apartment.</p>
        <p>''I can vaguely see the Mother of Jesus from the outside and from the inside I can't see anything,'' Mr. Rivas said. ''It's the first time in my whole life I've seen something like this.''</p>
        <p>Another visitor, Thomas Connelly, a 48-year-old salesman of lab equipment, stopped by Washington Street while returning from a business trip to Manhattan. Mr. Connelly did not seem quite convinced. In 1992, he said, he had visited the Marlboro home that attracted thousands after the owner, Joseph Januszkiewicz, said Mary appeared near his backyard spruce trees on the first Sunday of each month.</p>
        <p>''When I was there I got an emotional feeling and smelled the scent of roses,'' he said after looking for minutes at the window. ''I don't get that same feeling I had in Marlboro. The window's very vivid in color, but I don't know what to look for. I can see kind of a face if I imagine it.''</p>
