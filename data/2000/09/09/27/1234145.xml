        <p>As yet another drug scandal struck the Olympic track and field competition today, Marion Jones sprinted for the first time since the public announcement that her husband had tested positive for steroids, easily winning her opening heat in the 200 meters.</p>
        <p>Minutes before Jones's heat, the gold medal favorite in the women's hammer throw was told while on the track that she was ineligible to compete because she had failed a drug test for the steroid nandrolone.</p>
        <p>Mihaela Melinte of Romania, a two-time world champion in the hammer throw, became the seventh person suspended at the Sydney Games for failed drug tests. She tested positive June 7 at a meet in Milan, track and field's world governing body said.</p>
        <p>This was the third drug scandal involving Romanians in Sydney. Tuesday, the 16-year-old gymnastics all-around champion, Adreea Raducan, was stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for the stimulant ephedrine. Earlier, the entire Romanian weight-lifting team was expelled after two athletes had tested positive for nandrolone before the Games. The lifters who had not tested positive were allowed back in after Romanian Olympic officials paid a $50,000 fine.</p>
        <p>More than 50 athletes have either withdrawn before the Games or been caught during the Sydney Olympics in drug-related offenses, confirming the belief by many that the use of performance-enhancing drugs is widespread.</p>
        <p>This morning Melinte was preparing to warm up for the hammer throw qualifying round when ''she was informed of the reason why she could not compete,'' said Giorgio Reineri, a spokesman for track and field's world governing body, known as the I.A.A.F. ''She said she didn't know.''</p>
        <p>Nandrolone is the steroid for which the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, Jones's husband, tested positive for four times this summer, the I.A.A.F. said. Hunter has said that he believed he ingested the substance from taking improperly labeled and contaminated nutritional supplements.</p>
        <p>Jones did not refer to her husband's troubles after she won her heat of the women's 200 meters in 22.75 seconds. She spoke only of her race, saying she was simply trying to conserve energy in the first heat because she had another round of the 200 scheduled for tonight, as well as qualifying for the long jump. Her awkward form in that event figures to be her biggest impediment to becoming the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics.</p>
        <p>''I stated all along that this day was going to be the most difficult for me because I had two heats of the 200 and the long jump,'' Jones said.</p>
        <p>Withdrawing from the 200 was Inger Miller, the 1999 world champion and the only real threat to Jones in the event. Miller earlier withdrew from the 100 meters, which Jones won last Saturday, after suffering a strained hamstring in training before the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>Miller is still hoping she can run on the American 4x100-meter relay, which is scheduled for Saturday, her agent, Emanuel Hudson, said this morning.</p>
        <p>Given the suspicion that exists in track and field, especially in the wake of several withdrawals from the Games and the revelation that Hunter had tested positive for the steroid nandrolone, Miller is concerned that if she does not run the relay, many will suspect that she, too, had failed a drug test, Hudson said.</p>
        <p>Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of the United States track and field federation, said specifically that Miller did not fail a drug test and was eligible to compete in Sydney.</p>
        <p>''She just finished telling me she wanted to run in the relay,'' Hudson said of Miller. ''With all the stuff regarding drugs, we want her to run just so there will be no suspicions.''</p>
        <p>Suzy Favor Hamilton had the fastest time in the preliminary heats of the women's 1,500 meters in 4 minutes 8.08 seconds and is an inviting position now to win the gold medal. The American champion, Regina Jacobs, withdrew before the Games with a respiratory viral infection. And today, the defending Olympic champion at 800 and 1,500 meters, Svetlana Masterkova of Russia, did not complete her heat of the 1,500.</p>
        <p>Masterkova has had surgery on both Achilles' tendons in the past year, and her return to form has been uncertain.  She had dropped any intention of defending her 800-meter title and she had avoided the European racing circuit as she tried to regain her fitness. She pulled up during today's heat and burst into tears as she hobbled off the track.</p>
        <p>The other American entrant in the women's 1,500, Marla Runyan, struggled through the first round but qualified for the semifinals in 4:10.83. Runyan is the first legally blind athlete to make the American team in any sport.</p>
