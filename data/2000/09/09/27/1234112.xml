        <p>Surprised by the sweep of the vote for the opposition presidential candidate in Yugoslavia, but cautious about gloating, President Clinton praised the ''brave people'' there today for choosing change and sought to embolden them by offering to lift economic sanctions if they prevail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who has dealt throughout his presidency with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia as a noxious central character, warned that although Mr. Milosevic seems to have lost his legitimacy, he may still try to ''cling to power at the expense of his people.''</p>
        <p>Despite the public wariness, born of watching Mr. Milosevic manipulate his way out of seemingly impossible corners, the Clinton administration has concluded that the Yugoslav has finally lost his magic.</p>
        <p>No longer, senior officials said today, is Mr. Milosevic invincible in the eyes of his people, and signs of fissures within Mr. Milosevic's ruling circle spelled the beginning of the end, they added.</p>
        <p>Telling evidence of paralysis is appearing within his government, the officials said. Student leaders, who had been arrested and harrassed before the election, have been left alone by the police and the military in the last 48 hours. The barrage of official propaganda through the state news media has virtually ground to a halt, and acolytes of Mr. Milosevic have given varying accounts of the vote tally, creating a picture of confusion in the inner sanctum.</p>
        <p>And the decision today by Mr. Milosevic to call a second round of voting on Oct. 8 was interpreted by administration officials as a desperate effort to buy time.</p>
        <p>The fact that Mr. Milosevic did not announce an outright victory, the officials said, means that he either failed to set up an efficient scheme to steal votes or that he would have had to steal too many to make a credible claim. In contrast to Mr. Milosevic's weak election operation, the opposition movement managed to organize a fast parallel vote count, enabling them to announce a credible 54.66 percent victory for their candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, over Mr. Milosevic's 35.01 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic's forces suddenly announced today that preliminary results showed he had finished second with 40.23 percent, and the opposition had won with 48.22 percent. With neither side reaching more than 50 percent, the government said, a runoff is needed.</p>
        <p>Clinton administration officials said they hoped that in the next two weeks the opposition would create even more of a steamroller and that Mr. Milosevic would not be able to withstand it.</p>
        <p>But it is also possible, Balkan experts in the administration said, that Mr. Milosevic could try to cut a deal with Mr. Kostunica. And it is conceivable, given his past behavior, that Mr. Milosevic could create some kind of crisis: either an intervention in Montenegro, the smaller republic in Yugoslavia where the leadership boycotted the election, or a cancellation of the election altogether.</p>
        <p>As they assessed the uncertain situation in Belgrade and other urban centers, the administration tried to weave a delicate balance between showing support for the opposition, which it helped finance, and keeping a distance so as not to offend Yugoslavia's voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, a proud Serbian nationalist, is stridently anti-American and has repeatedly said that if he came to power, he would not allow Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague, to be handed over for trial. He has strongly criticized the West's war in Kosovo and the presence of NATO peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>Extending a hand of friendship to the opposition -- and urging it to keep its courage -- Mr. Clinton said today in a speech at Georgetown University Law Center that Serbia, the dominant republic, would have much to gain with a change of power.</p>
        <p>''If the will of the people is respected, the doors to Europe and the world will be open again to Serbia,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''We will take steps with our allies to lift economic sanctions, and the people of Serbia who have suffered so much finally will have a chance to lead normal lives. I hope that day is arriving.''</p>
        <p>But he also acknowledged differences with the opposition, whose forces benefited in the last year from $25 million in support from the Clinton administration for get-out-the-vote groups and independent news media.</p>
        <p>''I am under no illusions that a new government in Serbia would automatically lead to a rapprochement between the two of us,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''And any new leader of Serbia should pursue, first and foremost, the interests of its own people.''</p>
        <p>In Europe, support for the opposition was unequivocal. The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said France, as the current president of the European Union, would reward an opposition victory with the rapid lifting of sanctions.</p>
        <p>''The hour of change has struck in Belgrade,'' Mr. Vedrine said. ''Something has begun with this vote that is no longer to be stopped.''</p>
        <p>In what administration officials saw as an encouraging sign, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, persuaded the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to join him in a statement in Moscow on Monday that stressed the vitality of the Serbian opposition and the democratic process.</p>
        <p>If Russia can be removed from Mr. Milosevic's camp, then his isolation will be almost complete, officials here said. One of the comfort factors that Mr. Milosevic has traditionally offered his top cronies is the notion that there is always some major country for them to turn to.</p>
        <p>The administration even took small cheer from the fact that Mr. Milosevic invited election observers to come from China -- he declined to accept them from anywhere else -- but that the Chinese did not come.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Clinton pointed out today, there was no certainty that the Yugoslav drama would end without violence.</p>
        <p>''I do not underestimate Mr. Milosevic's desire to cling to power at the expense of his people,'' Mr. Clinton said, referring to the war in Kosovo last year and NATO air raids in Bosnia in 1995. ''I have witnessed it, lived with it and responded to it first-hand.''</p>
        <p>In some quarters, Mr. Milosevic's desire for a second round of voting was seen as an effort to try to organize military and police units that would fight, if necessary.</p>
        <p>''His strategy has always been: string them out and then beat them up,'' said one official, recalling the scenes in 1991 when Mr. Milosevic called out tanks against protestors in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>But nearly 10 years later, it seems that the Serbian people have given more votes to a charismatic leader of a united opposition: Mr. Kostunica. And after three lost wars -- over Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo -- it seems that many in the military and the police have voted for him.</p>
        <p>''The question now is how Milosevic will go out and who he will take out with him,'' said one administration official who has been at the center of Balkans policy. ''Finally, the people stood up.''</p>
