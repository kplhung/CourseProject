        <p>The Justice Department yesterday named the experts who will review the software for the controversial Internet wiretap system known as Carnivore. The contract for examining the software went to the IIT Research Institute, a nonprofit arm of the Illinois Institute of Technology that conducts contract research for government and industry. Although law enforcement officials have said Carnivore is only used to gather a narrow range of information about a suspect's online wanderings, Internet service providers and civil liberties advocates have criticized the system as a ''black box'' open to abuse. They have demanded that the Federal Bureau of Investigation subject the technology to public review to ensure that privacy is not illegally violated. IIT's contract calls for a final report by Dec. 8.</p>
