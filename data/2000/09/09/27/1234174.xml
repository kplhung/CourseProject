        <p>When the USA Network lost the rights to show World Wrestling Federation matches this fall, it seemed a potentially stunning blow to its prime-time schedule. But the network said it would be able to stanch any potential ratings losses with its own original series.</p>
        <p>Yesterday USA announced that it was canceling two original series on which it had pinned many hopes: ''The War Next Door'' and ''Manhattan, AZ.''</p>
        <p>Those programs, both quirky, half-hour Sunday night comedies, had been shown for eight weeks. They drew poor ratings. Each was  watched by an audience that averaged about 1.3 million people, executives said.</p>
        <p>USA did not say what would ultimately replace the programs, but it is expected that for now movies would run on Sunday nights instead.</p>
        <p>The timing of the cancellations was not ideal. The programs of the World Wrestling Federation formally moved to Viacom's TNN and MTV networks this week.</p>
        <p>The wrestling federation won the right to switch cable networks early last summer after a long court battle. USA's Monday night W.W.F. wrestling program ''Raw Is War'' was often the No. 1 prime-time show  on cable. With it, USA had been able to maintain its status as the top-rated basic-cable network in prime time.</p>
        <p>Executives said they would soon announce plans for the network in the post-wrestling era. They also said yesterday that they had appointed a new head of programming, Jim Miller, previously a television writer and producer.</p>
        <p>The network's senior vice president for original series, David Eick, is leaving for Studios USA, the USA Networks Inc. television production studio. Mr. Eick has signed a development deal with Studios USA.</p>
