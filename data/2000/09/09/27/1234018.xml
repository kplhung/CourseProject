        <p>Moments after he was cut last spring, a stunned Doug Mientkiewicz had to make a torturous 500-yard walk across the parking lot, from the Twins' glamorous major league facility to its minor league outpost, from the big time to Mayberry.</p>
        <p>For months, Mientkiewicz was angry with Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly for lumping him into a group of young, but petulant, talents. He was bitter toward the Twins' management for so easily casting aside their incumbent first baseman.</p>
        <p>Today, he wanted to thank Kelly. Today, those 500 yards had turned into Mientkiewicz's own walk of fame. If he had played in the major leagues this year, he wouldn't have had a chance to find glory as pure as this on a worldwide stage. For the second time in a week, the 23-year-old Mientkiewicz delivered the game-winning home run against South Korea's unflappable pitching staff.</p>
        <p>This time, he gave the United States a 3-2 victory in the ninth, and pushed this American collection of misfits into the Olympic gold medal game later tonight against their geopolitical rival, the mighty Cubans.</p>
        <p>''It's really amazing,'' Mientkiewicz said. ''I want to shake Tom Kelly's hand for saying I wasn't ready for the big leagues.''</p>
        <p>The roster is full of guys like Mientkiewicz. Some older, some younger. But all of them have taken the lead of Manager Tommy Lasorda and found joy in the pressure of representing their country. Now, faced with Cuba -- the only team that has beaten them in Sydney, and the only one that has brought out the Americans' fighting side -- they want to remember to relax.</p>
        <p>''We have nothing against Cuba, believe me,'' said Lasorda, whose team was involved in a bench-clearing brawl during its 6-1 loss to Cuba last week. ''We just want to have a good game against them, and may the best team win.''</p>
        <p>Today, the team with the keenest survival instincts won. Mientkiewicz's solo home run with one out in the bottom of the night ended a game that crossed the border of the bizarre. There was nightlong drizzle, plus a lightning storm that scared the first base umpire, Paul Begg, off the field before the plate umpire, Cesar Valdes, summoned him back into position. Finally, after one too many thunderclaps, the game was delayed two hours while the storm passed.</p>
        <p>Just after play resumed at midnight, the odd-ball atmosphere began again. The United States had the bases loaded with one out but a controversial double play ended its chance to break a 2-2 tie. After a throw to the plate for one forceout, South Korean catcher Jang Sung Ho turned to fire to first in hopes of turning a tough double play. But Jang was whacked by a forearm in the back of the head by the incoming American, Brent Abernathy. Jang dropped the ball on the play. Much to Lasorda's dismay, Valdes called interference and the double play was awarded.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen anything like it,'' Lasorda said.</p>
        <p>Not even Mientkiewicz's last plate appearance was normal. When he came up to bat, the plan was for Mientkiewicz to bunt. But Travis Dawkins, the pinch-runner put into the game for his base-running savvy, was picked off by reliever Park Seok Jin. ''My first thought was, 'Now I don't have to bunt,' '' Mientkiewicz said.</p>
        <p>As he swung through the ball, Mientkiewicz threw his bat in the air like a bride's bouquet and started to celebrate until he realized the ball was starting to die in the drizzle.</p>
        <p>''When I hit it, I thought it was going over,'' he said. ''If it didn't, I would have felt like the biggest idiot. I didn't know what to do, if I should take my shirt off or what.''</p>
        <p>Launching into a pantomime routine, he waved his arms, trying to coax the ball to go a little farther. And it did, arching just over the right-field fence. The South Korean team was devastated -- again.</p>
        <p>''In a way, you're heart goes out to them,'' said Mientkiewicz, whose team was baffled for six innings by the confounding South Korean submarine pitcher, Chong Tae Hyon. ''They got it ripped out again.''</p>
        <p>He knows how that feels. Last spring, Mientkiewicz's spirits were crushed when he was sent down to the minor leagues. After playing first base for the Twins for the entire 1999 season, he was unceremoniously demoted. At one frustrating point, he reportedly said he would rather toil in the minors than play under Kelly.</p>
        <p>Today, he didn't want to be anywhere else but here: in Sydney, playing for a chance at a gold medal. It didn't matter if most of the fans had gone home during the rain delay. He didn't care who saw it live -- or tape-delayed.</p>
        <p>''If one person or 100 were left, it didn't put a damper on anything,'' he said. ''We get to play for a gold medal. Tonight, this hit was bigger than the last one against this team. There was much more at stake.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, the gold medal will be on the line. Mientkiewicz, who lives in Miami, understands the political atmosphere that will hang over the game. But after such an emotional journey here -- a path that included an endless 500-yard walk last spring -- he wants to put politics aside.</p>
        <p>''Cuba, to me, has no face,'' Mientkiewicz said. ''If Italy was the best in the world, I'd want to beat Italy.''</p>
