        <p>While making her one of the most celebrated women in the world, her performance in that role has driven nearly a decade of dinner table speculation about the scale of her ambition (Does she want to be president?) and the state of her marriage (Why does she stay with him?).</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Being first lady isn't a job, Hillary Rodham Clinton said early this year in Manhattan, ''it's a role.''</p>
        <p>While making her one of the most celebrated women in the world, her performance in that role has driven nearly a decade of dinner table speculation about the scale of her ambition (Does she want to be president?) and the state of her marriage (Why does she stay with him?).</p>
        <p>''I am a Rorschach test,'' she has said, for what Americans are struggling with in their working and married lives. A political cartoon -- one of thousands that Mrs. Clinton has inspired -- after the O. J. Simpson murder trial captured her ubiquity in pop culture as it lampooned her peculiar gift for making people suspicious: ''More bad news. The bloody glove fits Hillary.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's fame is a two-edged sword, allowing her into a political arena where no first lady has dared go before, but where many in the crowd just don't like her. The first first lady to have a law degree, to deride the baking of cookies, to testify before a criminal grand jury is also the first presidential spouse to try to use her fame as a springboard to elective federal office.</p>
        <p>Yet her role as first lady -- a spectacularly protean performance, veering from secretive boss of a failed health care plan to self-effacing advocate for children, from suspect in an Arkansas land deal to victim in America's biggest political sex scandal -- has also created a potential roadblock to her winning a Senate seat.</p>
        <p>One of three New Yorkers has an unfavorable opinion of her. Nationally, 4 of 10 Americans disapprove. Her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, is building much of his campaign around these negative ratings. His television advertisements end with the refrain, ''You just can't trust her.'' In a national fund-raising letter, Mr. Lazio said he could sum up why Americans should send him money in just six words, ''I'm running against Hillary Rodham Clinton.''</p>
        <p>The eagerness of outsiders to spend money to deny Mrs. Clinton a Senate seat from New York is a main reason this race is shaping up as the costliest in history.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton would not comment for this article, but her strategists acknowledge that voter disapproval is ''out there.''</p>
        <p>Voters have been annoyed by her move to New York. They have faulted what they say is her Hillary-knows-best tone. Some suspect that calculated ambition kept her in the White House during the Lewinsky scandal, as she stuck with a philanderer so she could run for the Senate. Others are taken aback by her willingness to endure the gossip that her campaign has rekindled.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's strategy for dealing with her negative ratings has been to try to grind them into dust. ''These are things you can overcome by doing, by doing the work,'' said Mark Penn, her pollster.</p>
        <p>In the last 18 months, Mrs. Clinton has traveled to every county in the state, paid extraordinarily careful attention to local concerns and explained her family-friendly policies in sometimes numbing detail.</p>
        <p>The grinding process helps explain why a race that seems so compelling from a distance can be so soporific viewed up close, as Mrs. Clinton instructs her supporters on the fine points of milk prices, pediatric procedures and upstate air fares. The strategy, though, may be working.</p>
        <p>The Negative Numbers Jump</p>
        <p>Not long after Mrs. Clinton signaled her interest in the Senate early last year, polls showed that the percentage of Americans who had a negative opinion of her jumped from the low 20's, where her unfavorable numbers had fallen during the sex scandal, to nearly 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Those negative ratings have since declined in New York, although not nationally. For most of this year, about a third of registered voters in the state have said they have an unfavorable opinion of her, while less than half view her positively, several New York Times/CBS polls found. With the election six weeks away, about one-third of those planning to vote for Mr. Lazio say they support him because he is not she.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton took a 9-point lead over Mr. Lazio, a Times/CBS poll found after their debate in Buffalo in mid-September, though other polls have shown them to be evenly matched. The polls also showed that she had narrowed a gap among suburban voters, while cutting into one of the surprise anomalies of her candidacy, a chilly reception among white women. Mr. Lazio held a big lead earlier in the year among white women, some polls found. But by September, the  picture was mixed. One poll had Mrs. Clinton slightly ahead among white women, another put Mr. Lazio ahead with them by 8  points.</p>
        <p>The closing weeks of the campaign are compelling many New Yorkers, especially undecided voters, to re-examine what, if anything, irritates them about Mrs. Clinton, and to decide whether they are irritated enough to vote for Mr. Lazio. Mr. Lazio, a Long Island congressman, remains an unknown quantity to more than a third of voters, and his negative poll ratings have risen from 10 to 28 percent since June.</p>
        <p>Barbara Barnett, an emergency room physician with two young children, told seven women in her book club on the night of the first Clinton-Lazio debate. ''I lost respect for her when she stood by him during Monica.''</p>
        <p>The debate in Buffalo was on the air as the book club convened, but the television set was off in the Westchester County home of Mary Ushay, the evening's host. Later,  several judged that Mrs. Clinton had won it handily and that Mr. Lazio had come across as a bully.</p>
        <p>The debate in Mrs. Ushay's living room in Eastchester had little to do with the policies, appearances or ads of candidate Clinton. Nor did it deal with Mr. Lazio, other than to wonder who he is and why he was running.</p>
        <p>Instead, the women in the living room, as they acknowledged to a reporter who sat with them, were obsessed about a first lady who was more soap opera character than Senate aspirant. The book club members, all white, married, middle-class residents of Westchester, said their lives were much too busy to pay careful attention to Mrs. Clinton's campaign. The four Democrats, three Republicans and one noncitizen said they routinely threw away her fliers.</p>
        <p>What intrigued them was the woman who stumbled as co-president when she sought to  revamp health insurance, who steeled her way through Whitewater, who seethed about ''a vast right wing conspiracy'' before her husband publicly admitted his affair with a White House intern.</p>
        <p>Watchers in Suburbia</p>
        <p>The book readers from Westchester (the week's book was ''The Poisonwood Bible,'' a favorite of Mrs. Clinton's) have been watching, wondering and arguing about the president's wife ever since they heard that he was a skirt chaser.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton insinuated herself into their lives with her 1992 appearance on ''60 Minutes,'' when Bill Clinton denied an affair with Gennifer Flowers (he later admitted it under oath) and she said, ''You know I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.''</p>
        <p>They remembered, too, how cold her body language seemed around the president during the impeachment fight. They had been amazed that her marriage survived and felt sorry for her daughter, Chelsea. But when Mrs. Clinton announced last year that she was running for the Senate and moving to Westchester, all the book club women, Democrat and Republican alike, said they felt used and manipulated. They said they were annoyed to be props for her ambition.</p>
        <p>''I resent her moving here,'' said Diane Cohen, 43, a Republican, a Pelham homemaker with two children. ''My guess is the minute she loses, if she loses, she'll be gone.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ushay, the host, a mother of three and a Democrat, said Mrs. Clinton might do a lot of good for New York. Echoing the others in the room, all mothers of young children, she said Mrs. Clinton knew more about children's issues and would probably do more for families than Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''We're talking about a junior senator from New York having an incredible in with someone who might be president,'' said Mrs. Ushay, 41. ''And yet, I don't want her to be my senator. She has so much baggage. She must have known what people would be talking about. Yet she still ran. I think she thinks a lot of herself.''</p>
        <p>With the exception of two Republicans in the room, all the women said Mrs. Clinton could win their vote, but it would not be enthusiastic or without regret. They were finding it all but impossible, they said, to separate the soap opera character of the last eight years from the Senate candidate of the last 18 months.</p>
        <p>''I just resent that she wasn't strong enough to leave him and go out on her own,'' said Dr. Barnett, 37, the emergency room physician and a Republican who described herself as undecided. ''We finally had the opportunity to have a strong first lady. But she used her marriage for personal gain. I can't get over that.''</p>
        <p>Half a block from the White House, Mr. Penn, the pollster and one of Mrs. Clinton's top strategists, sat in his second-floor office on Pennsylvania Avenue and listened to a summary of what the eight women had said  in the Westchester living room.</p>
        <p>He wasn't surprised. He has heard it  before, from his own polls and from focus groups. Carpetbagger. Pushy do-gooder. So hungry for power that she put up with a bad marriage. For Mr. Penn, these negative ratings are yesterday's news.</p>
        <p>''You are not going to erase those concerns,'' he said. ''Voters are going to balance them against how hard she has worked, what she stands for and what they think she'll do for them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Penn takes credit for devising the grind-the-negatives-to-dust strategy. ''No one has followed this problem, or issue, more than I have day and night for a year and a half,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His strategy for Mrs. Clinton is an updated New York model of a product the pollster has been selling for years to Mrs. Clinton's husband. A focus on small issues (school uniforms, emergency phone numbers, V-chips) helped President Clinton pull out of a public opinion nose dive during his first term. It also helped him to hang on to his job through the sex scandal.</p>
        <p>Above Mr. Penn's desk is a framed front page from The Washington Post with the banner headline, ''Clinton Acquitted.'' It bears the president's signature and the word, ''Thanks.''</p>
        <p>On his desk, amid photographs of the pollster with the president and Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Penn had poll results from the New York Senate debate. The results showed Mrs. Clinton winning among women, many of whom said they were put off by Mr. Lazio's aggressiveness.</p>
        <p>''If every woman had seen the debate,'' he said triumphantly, ''the rest of the campaign would effectively be canceled.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was on track, Mr. Penn said, in her slow and deliberate transformation from first lady figure to credible candidate.</p>
        <p>''There is an incredible standard that Hillary has to meet that no one else has to meet,'' he said. ''She is making steady progress. The average New Yorker has really got a chance to see who she is and not who they thought she was.''</p>
        <p>Because of the time that Mrs. Clinton has spent campaigning in the state, Mr. Penn said, there is now a ''a very big difference between the New York Hillary and the national Hillary.''</p>
        <p>The national Hillary, however, is the household name. That is the woman who rubs 4 out of 10 Americans the wrong way. She is the money machine behind the New York Senate race, both for herself and her adversaries.</p>
        <p>She has raised more than $22 million, 60 percent of it from outside New York, while  her adversaries have collected $39 million, much from of it from out-of-state Clinton haters. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani raised $23.3 million before he quit the race in May, and Mr. Lazio has collected $15.7 million.</p>
        <p>None of this counts millions in soft money collected by political parties, of which the Democrats have spent at least $5 million praising Mrs. Clinton and attacking her opponents. Mr. Lazio has not collected soft money, but advocacy groups and political committees, many using money raised outside New York, have bought television ads to help him. Last weekend, both campaigns agreed to stop using unregulated money.</p>
        <p>Anti-Hillary money bubbles up in places like Mobile, Ala., where in early September Mr. Lazio arrived by chartered jet for a $500-a-plate shrimp-and-grits breakfast. It was a hard-money event, meaning that it collected donations of up to $2,000 from individuals, money that can be spent directly on Mr. Lazio's campaign.</p>
        <p>Standing on a spiral staircase in a handsome Greek Revival home with four white columns out front, the congressman spoke to 90 people for about five minutes and vacuumed up $45,000.</p>
        <p>The day before Mr. Lazio nipped in and out, The Mobile Register ran an editorial cartoon that explained the metaphysics of the breakfast. On the right side of the cartoon stood Mrs. Clinton, a big smile on her face and her body drawn in the shape of a pudgy punching bag. A sign above her head said ''$500 a pop.''</p>
        <p>A man with ''NY'' on his back and boxing gloves on his hands said to a fellow pugilist from Alabama, ''Be my guest, my distinguished Southern friend.'' The Alabamian replied, ''After you, my noble brother from the North.'' A tiny elephant exclaimed, ''Republican unity, thy name is Hillary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's big applause line in his brief speech came when he promised to ''bring the Clinton era to an end.'' That was according to several people in the room. The event was private, and a Lazio press aide shut the front door of the house in reporters' faces just before the congressman spoke.</p>
        <p>But after Mr. Lazio left the house, in pursuit of more anti-Hillary money in Louisiana and Texas, four Alabama Republicans, three men and a woman, stayed behind to talk about why it is worth sending money to New York to stop Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>For David A. Bagwell, 54, a Mobile lawyer who has a son in college and who said that for him ''$500 is a lot of money,'' the irritation started with health care in 1993.</p>
        <p>''Not only was it, we know what is right and we'll tell you what is best, it was, we are going to do this in secret because you aren't smart enough to understand,'' Mr. Bagwell said.</p>
        <p>Patricia Hooks, 53, whose husband owns a tugboat company in Mobile, said she saw through Mrs. Clinton the first time she saw her on ''60 Minutes'' in 1992. Mrs. Hooks remembers thinking that this ''is a woman who wants power, who wants control, who wants to be on the national stage.''</p>
        <p>The four Republicans said they expected and feared that Mrs. Clinton was using the Senate race in New York as a steppingstone for a run at the presidency. They had had their fill of Bill Clinton, they said, and the prospect of his wife in the White House made them furious.</p>
        <p>'A Scalawag and a Carpetbagger'</p>
        <p>John D. Peebles, a real estate agent from Mobile, said New Yorkers might not be able to fathom the depth of conservative Southern antipathy for the Clintons. Many Southerners, he said, see the president as a scalawag, a local white man who has betrayed the values and traditions of the South. His wife, Mr. Peebles said, has quite literally become a carpetbagger, albeit in the North.</p>
        <p>''The marriage of a scalawag and a carpetbagger,'' Mr. Peebles said. ''You cannot be more objectionable in the South.''</p>
        <p>Objections to Mrs. Clinton, of course, are not confined to the South. For years, polls have shown that a broad slice of the American public cannot abide her.</p>
        <p>Before Mrs. Clinton became a Senate candidate, the White House strategy for reducing her negative ratings was to encourage her to retreat to the shadows.</p>
        <p>James Carville, the longtime political adviser to the Clintons, said the rule of thumb was the less visible she was in the press, the better her numbers were in the polls.</p>
        <p>That rule of thumb was discovered halfway through the first term, when Mrs. Clinton's troubles with Whitewater and health care surfaced. In some polls, she was less popular than he was.</p>
        <p>''It has been difficult for Hillary to fit into the perceptions and expectations of the role of first lady,'' said the Rev. Donald G. Jones, her longtime friend and her mentor when she was growing up in Chicago. ''The office of first lady is one of the most unevolved. Perceptions people have of it are pretty much fixed by Barbara Bush, Nancy Reagan, Jackie Kennedy, by people who minded their own business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones, a professor of ethics at Drew University in Madison, N.J., said Mrs. Clinton would be relieved to shed ''the baggage that she carried around as first lady.''</p>
        <p>As for the Americans who dislike Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Carville said they could no more keep her out of the Senate than they could keep her husband out of the White House.</p>
        <p>''She can win easy with a third of the voters hating her,'' Mr. Carville said. ''If she wins this thing, they'll be jumping off bridges.''</p>
