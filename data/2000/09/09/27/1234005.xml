        <p>In May, federal highway safety officials proposed that all commercial trucks be equipped with electronic tracking devices to record when they are rolling and when they are standing still. The idea was to make sure drivers have enough rest, thereby reducing accidents. But so far, the proposal's main impact has been to bring a new dimension to the debate about Big Brother in the workplace.</p>
        <p>Employee surveillance by computers and video cameras is nothing new. The American Management Association reports that two-thirds of major American corporations now record their employees' phone conversations, review e-mail messages and computer files or videotape work performances.</p>
        <p>Less known, however, is the growing use of devices that generate an electronic trail of where employees go, what routes they take and how fast they move about as they do their jobs.</p>
        <p>''The potential for ubiquitous monitoring is growing rapidly, and there has never been a discussion about what this means in terms of stress and repetitive strain injuries and the quality of living,'' said Charley Richardson, director of labor extension at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell.</p>
        <p>''It's not just that we're being monitored,'' he added. ''It's that the information that's gathered through monitoring is fed back through the system and used to more tightly control us.''</p>
        <p>Truckers, who are meeting this week with officials of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and others in Washington, are the most vociferous in their hostility to location monitoring. But they are not the only ones being electronically tracked. Nurses, cooks, security guards, miners, casino change-makers, couriers, public works employees and others are increasingly being asked to wear badges, or carry gear, that records where they go.</p>
        <p>''It's very easy to track who is going where, who is on every floor, who is talking to whom,'' said Christina Terranova, a nurse and legal representative to the New York State Nurses Association, who has deep reservations about the use of electronic tracking in hospitals. ''We have nurses who say, 'Oh, it's great,' -- and I want to shake them.''</p>
        <p>The nurses who think electronic tracking is great, though, argue that it helps them quickly find colleagues in maze-like hospitals and eliminates the tedium of keeping paper logs. Hospital tracking systems usually involve badges that emit infrared signals, which are picked up by sensors embedded in room and hall ceilings. The sensors can transmit the locations of hundreds, even thousands, of nurses, orderlies, doctors, housekeepers and even patients as they go from place to place.</p>
        <p>The people show up as color-coded icons, moving about on schematic floor plans that can be called up instantly on a computer screen, or stored and retrieved for future analysis if, say, a costly piece of equipment turns up missing, if a patient complains that his calls are going unanswered or if nurses complain that certain departments or shifts are dangerously understaffed.</p>
        <p>Some hospitals have used electronic monitoring to calculate the average time nurses spend on certain procedures and even punish those who linger too long at one task, Ms. Terranova said. ''God forbid a patient was frightened and maybe you wanted to sit with them for five minutes,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere, location-tracking technology has been tested by restaurants to determine whether kitchen workers wash their hands and for how long and is currently being used by mining concerns to make sure far-flung rigs are digging in exactly the right places. Courier companies use location-monitoring devices to identify delivery patterns.</p>
        <p>''It allows them to analyze the data and figure out how to wring any excess capacity out of the system,'' said Mr. Richardson, himself a former courier, whose academic work focuses on work restructuring.</p>
        <p>Numerous municipalities have already put location-monitoring devices to work keeping track of where buses, snowplows and other vehicles are. Once in place, though, the systems can also prove useful in improving civil-service accountability. Denver announced earlier this year that it might soon begin tracking its 14,000 city workers, after an embarrassing local television expose showed some of them playing cards, sleeping and eating leisurely breakfasts during business hours.</p>
        <p>''I must have gotten calls from at least 75 different contractors who said they provided this service,'' said Andrew Hudson, the spokesman for the mayor.</p>
        <p>The devices being used by the trucking industry generally rely on the Global Positioning System, or G.P.S., which can pinpoint truck locations anywhere in the country. Many big fleets have have already installed G.P.S. devices, which enable dispatchers to change routes at the last minute, add pickups and deliveries and otherwise improve efficiency.</p>
        <p>Some systems can keep track of a truck's speed, braking patterns, efficiency as the driver shifts through the gears and engine condition. ''They can even start and stop the truck. The possibilities are endless,'' said Michael H. Belzer, an associate professor of industrial and labor relations at Wayne State University in Detroit.</p>
        <p>Some drivers complain that the technology gives dispatchers the ability to catch them napping and order them back into traffic, even when they are overly tired.</p>
        <p>What riles owner-operators most, though, is the specter of the government's using the electronic data for law enforcement. Right now, many have disdain for a law that limits their driving time to 10 hours, with breaks of at least 8 hours in between. They say the requirement fails to account adequately for loading and unloading time.</p>
        <p>''Most drivers that you talk to will tell you, 'I keep two logs. One for the carrier that pays me, and one to show the police,' '' said John Siebert, project manager for the Owner Operators Independent Drivers Association Foundation, which studies the concerns of owner-operators.</p>
        <p>The proposed regulations would put an end to such faking by replacing paper logs with electronic data. Federal officials say truckers have nothing to fear as long as they don't speed or break other laws. But opponents fear that once information is on file somewhere, it will be put to unforeseen uses.</p>
        <p>''They look you right in the eye and say, 'If you have nothing to hide, then there's no reason to have any hackles raised,' '' Mr. Siebert said. ''That's a slippery slope for them to be on.''</p>
