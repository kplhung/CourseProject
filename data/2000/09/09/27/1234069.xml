        <p>China stepped up its attacks on the Vatican today for its plans to canonize 120 Catholics who were killed in China between 1648 and 1930.</p>
        <p>Though the Vatican considers them martyrs for their faith, a Chinese government spokesman contended that many had ''committed monstrous crimes against the Chinese people,'' and he accused the Vatican of glorifying Western imperialism.</p>
        <p>''The majority of these people were executed for violation of Chinese laws during the invasion of China by imperialists and colonialists, or were killed for bullying Chinese people during the Opium War or the invasion by the eight allied powers,'' the spokesman, Sun Yuxi, said today at a Foreign Ministry news conference.</p>
        <p>The dispute appears to reflect a recent worsening of relations between China and the Vatican, despite reports of secret talks during the last year apparently aimed at reconciliation.</p>
        <p>European invasions of the 19th century -- the Opium War of 1839-42, which forced China to allow sales of the drug, and the invasion by Western powers in 1900 to suppress the anti-foreign Boxer movement -- are remembered bitterly here as national humiliations.</p>
        <p>The Vatican's plan to give sainthood to 87 Chinese Catholics and 33 European missionaries, many of whom were killed during those events, has touched a raw nerve among political leaders, who say the Roman Catholic Church itself helped to subjugate China in the past and plotted against the Communist revolution.</p>
        <p>In a response issued late today, Joaquin Navarro Valls, the Vatican's spokesman, said, ''Next Sunday's ceremony has no political motivation and is not directed against anyone.'' The missionaries to be canonized, he said, had sacrificed ''to serve the Chinese people,'' and he accused Chinese officials of a ''unilateral reading of history.''</p>
        <p>The Chinese spokesman's attack and another stinging denunciation of the Vatican today by China's official Patriotic Catholic Church, which does not accept the authority of the pope, were featured on the television news here tonight.</p>
        <p>The Vatican has scheduled the canonization ceremony for Oct. 1, which is the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, and that, for China, adds to the insult. Vatican officials say the date was selected simply because it is the feast of St. Theresa of Lisieux, patron of missions.</p>
        <p>China and the Vatican broke ties in 1951 and Chinese Catholics have been split ever since. Today, the official Patriotic Catholic Church says, it has 70 bishops and four million followers. Vatican officials have estimated that eight million Chinese, along with many priests and bishops, remain loyal to the pope in a parallel illegal church that faces frequent police harassment.</p>
        <p>Apparently in an effort to minimize the provocation of Beijing, the Vatican did not include any Catholics killed under Communist rule in its new list of prospective saints.</p>
        <p>But Vatican leaders were angered in January when China made a show of ordaining several new bishops of its official church on the same day the pope was to ordain bishops.</p>
        <p>Last week a top Vatican official, Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, 77, made a rare public visit to Beijing to attend a conference, giving rise to speculation about a possible breakthrough in relations. But there was little sign of that when Cardinal Etchegaray said this week in Rome that in his meetings with church officials here, he had ''protested energetically against a new wave of arrests of the faithful, even of bishops, which took place when I was in China.''</p>
        <p>One of the Roman Catholic leaders reportedly arrested last week was an 81-year-old bishop, Zeng Jingmu, who has spent more than 30 years in jail for his open defiance.</p>
        <p>The official church issued a statement today accusing the Vatican of attempting ''to distort and tamper with history.''</p>
        <p>''Quite a few of those to be canonized are notorious,'' the official church's statement said, calling them ''accomplices of imperialists.''</p>
        <p>Today the government also announced more explicit rules governing the religious activities of foreigners in China. The authorities have been alarmed by an influx of secret missionaries, mainly evangelical Protestants, who enter the country as tourists, business people or teachers to support the growing illegal ''house church'' movement.</p>
        <p>According to the new rules, foreigners may preach in a church only with the permission of government authorities at the provincial level or higher. Otherwise they are strictly forbidden to promote their beliefs among Chinese citizens, distribute religious materials or otherwise engage in missionary work.</p>
