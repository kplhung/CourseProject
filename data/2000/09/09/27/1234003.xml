        <p>ANYONE who has ever roasted a chicken or a duck knows that the eternal challenge is to get the meat to be moist and tender and the skin so crisp it crackles. There are many techniques devised to achieve this -- broiling, lots of basting, searing -- but these may come too late in the game.</p>
        <p>At Cafe Boulud, the crisping process begins with the raw birds, which are cleaned, trussed and hung on meat hooks in the walk-in refrigerator for a few days. Uncovered, the skin dries out and firms up. When it hits a hot pan, it crisps like a potato chip, yet the meat stays moist.</p>

        <p>ANYONE who has ever roasted a chicken or a duck knows that the eternal challenge is to get the meat to be moist and tender and the skin so crisp it crackles. There are many techniques devised to achieve this -- broiling, lots of basting, searing -- but these may come too late in the game.</p>
        <p>At Cafe Boulud, the crisping process begins with the raw birds, which are cleaned, trussed and hung on meat hooks in the walk-in refrigerator for a few days. Uncovered, the skin dries out and firms up. When it hits a hot pan, it crisps like a potato chip, yet the meat stays moist.</p>
        <p>Andrew Carmellini, the restaurant's chef, said the idea came from the preparation of suckling pigs, which are usually hung in the refrigerator to draw moisture out of the skin. With chickens, hens and squab, the cooks brown the birds in clarified butter and roast them at 450 degrees, spooning on butter and herbs in the last few minutes.</p>
        <p>This technique can be adapted to the home. Last Thursday I bought a quail, a guinea hen and a chicken, rinsed them, dried them and then placed them on a baking rack on a baking sheet and put them in the refrigerator, turning them once the next day. On Sunday, I bought the same birds and roasted the fresh and the dried together. The difference was marked. The dried birds started out with darkened, leathery skin and emerged from the oven brown, like a hazelnut with a thick crackly shell. The skin of the fresh birds was paler, thinner and flabbier.</p>
        <p>Next time, I would dry the birds for just two days. With the quail, one day would be enough: it's a skinny bird with very little fat, and the legs were dry. When you are ready to cook, rub the bird with oil or butter before seasoning or the salt will not cling to the skin.</p>
