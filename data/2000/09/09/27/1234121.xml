        <p>The Supreme Court handed a major tactical victory to the Microsoft Corporation today when it rejected the government's plea to hear the appeal of its landmark antitrust case immediately and instead returned the proceeding to a lower court.</p>
        <p>The decision gives Microsoft greater breathing room to pursue its appeals, relieves the company of any pressure to return any time soon to the bargaining table and, in the absence of a settlement, could have the effect of prolonging a final court judgment by a year or longer.</p>
        <p>It returns the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which in the past has shown a greater receptivity to Microsoft's defenses than has the trial judge. And it is virtually certain to have the effect of leaving the supervision of the federal case in the hands of the next administration, which Microsoft executives hope will be open to reconsidering both the merits of the lawsuit and the order to break up the company.</p>
        <p>Microsoft executives applauded today's decision.</p>
        <p>''I'm happy that we're moving on with the process,'' said Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive of Microsoft, in an interview in San Francisco, where the company was announcing an alliance aimed at capturing the high end of the corporate computing world. ''We are confident in our case on appeal.'' [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>For their part, Justice Department officials today began preparing for a new round of court appearances. ''We look forward to presenting our case to the court of appeals as expeditiously as possible,'' said Gina Talamona, a department spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Before today's decision, the government had tried to short-circuit the uncertainties associated with bringing the case to the court of appeals by going directly to the Supreme Court instead.</p>
        <p>Arguing that the case against Microsoft involved issues of ''immense importance to our national economy,'' the Justice Department had urged the Supreme Court to invoke a rarely used procedural rule to bypass the appeals court, quickly review the case and uphold the order issued by Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson three months ago to slice Microsoft into two smaller companies.</p>
        <p>After a 78-day trial, Judge Jackson ruled in April that Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, had repeatedly violated federal antitrust law, bullied rivals and stifled competition and innovation. In June, Judge Jackson ruled that the company should be broken up but stayed that order pending appeal.</p>
        <p>Microsoft had opposed the government's request for immediate Supreme Court review, saying it ''would impose an extraordinary burden on the court'' and that there was no reason to depart from the normal procedure of using the appeals court to narrow the complex legal issues and voluminous trial record.</p>
        <p>Today the Supreme Court, in a perfunctory three-sentence order, agreed. It directed that the case be sent to the court of appeals. The appeals court had already decided that the full court -- not the usual three-member panel -- would hear the proceeding and that it would move quickly. The full court has 10 members, but 3 have recused themselves from this case for undisclosed reasons.</p>
        <p>Within hours of the Supreme Court's announcement, the court of appeals ordered the government and Microsoft to submit scheduling proposals for its proceeding by Monday.</p>
        <p>Following its usual practice when it denies reviews, the Supreme Court did not announce the actual vote among the nine justices. But in a published dissent from today's decision, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said he had voted to hear the appeal because the case ''significantly affects an important sector of the economy.''</p>
        <p>''Speed in reaching a final decision may help create legal certainty,'' Justice Breyer wrote. ''That certainty, in turn, may further the economic development of that sector so important to our nation's prosperity.''</p>
        <p>For now, though, the court's decision dramatically reshapes the contours of the case and is a big legal win for Microsoft on several levels. Foremost among them is the timing of the case.</p>
        <p>For both Microsoft and the government, the timeline is crucial. Experts have raised concerns that fast-paced changes in both the technology and the marketplace may make the proposed remedy of splitting Microsoft both irrelevant and unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Government officials have long feared that it was to Microsoft's advantage to stretch out the time of the case as long as possible. For its part, Microsoft has denied that it is interested in delay, maintaining that its primary goal is getting the case dismissed as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>As he has in the past, Mr. Ballmer today denied that the company had opposed immediate review by the Supreme Court in an effort to slow down the legal process.</p>
        <p>''For us the best resolution will be a court decision that allows us to continue to innovate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The appeals court includes two judges who in 1998 handed a legal victory to Microsoft in a separate but related case. They ruled that Judge Jackson was wrong on the law when he ordered Microsoft to immediately unbundle its Windows operating system and its Internet Explorer Web browser. Earlier this year Judge Jackson took the unusual step of criticizing the appeals court ruling, saying that it ignored antitrust precedents laid down by the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>After they deliberate over the next few months, the seven judges on the appeals court have a wide range of options, including sending the case back to Judge Jackson for further proceedings consistent with their ruling, a process that can further delay a final resolution.</p>
        <p>After the court of appeals rules, the case could go to the Supreme Court. But, since the Supreme Court is under no obligation to review the eventual decision of the appeals court, that court could have the last word, although that may not be known until some time in 2001 or later.</p>
        <p>Finally, today's decision virtually assures that the government's case will wind up under the control of a new administration that could, if it wanted, either drop the federal lawsuit or seek to rekindle settlement negotiations on less-onerous terms than those offered by officials in the Clinton Administration. It remains to be seen how closely the next administration would work with the attorneys general in the 19 states that have brought a parallel antitrust case against Microsoft.</p>
        <p>In an unusual statement attached to today's decision, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist defended his decision to participate in the Microsoft case even though his son, James C. Rehnquist, is a Boston lawyer representing Microsoft in private antitrust litigation that could be affected by the outcome of the government's antitrust lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Justice Rehnquist said his son had no financial interests in the outcome of the case, and that he did not believe that his impartiality ''might reasonably be questioned.''</p>
        <p>''A decision by this court as to Microsoft's antitrust liability could have a significant effect on Microsoft's exposure to antitrust suits in other courts,'' Justice Rehnquist said. ''But, by virtue of this court's position atop the federal judiciary, the impact of many of our decisions is often quite broad. The fact that our disposition of the pending Microsoft litigation could potentially affect Microsoft's exposure to antitrust liability in other litigation does not, to my mind, significantly distinguish the present situation from other cases that this court decides.''</p>
