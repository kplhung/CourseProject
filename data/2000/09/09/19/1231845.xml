        <p>New York City has chosen a Tennessee company for a three-year contract to take over the trouble-plagued health care system on  Rikers Island in a deal that would be  one of the nation's largest private contracts for inmate medical care.</p>
        <p>The company, Prison Health Services of Brentwood, Tenn., would handle primary medical and mental health care for about 13,000 inmates  on Rikers Island and at the Manhattan Detention Center and the Vernon C.

        <p>New York City has chosen a Tennessee company for a three-year contract to take over the trouble-plagued health care system on  Rikers Island in a deal that would be  one of the nation's largest private contracts for inmate medical care.</p>
        <p>The company, Prison Health Services of Brentwood, Tenn., would handle primary medical and mental health care for about 13,000 inmates  on Rikers Island and at the Manhattan Detention Center and the Vernon C. Bain Barge, the city's floating jail, city officials said. The contract, still under negotiation, would be worth  $200 million to $300 million.</p>
        <p>It would replace St. Barnabas Medical Center in the Bronx, which was hired in 1998 to cut medical costs on Rikers with a new managed care program. Inmate complaints increased threefold after St. Barnabas took over, and the Manhattan district attorney opened a criminal investigation into problems with the care given to more than a dozen prisoners, including four who died. St. Barnabas has defended its performance, criticizing the city's oversight and the poor condition of the medical system it inherited, but it declined to bid on the new contract.</p>
        <p>Prison Health Services, a 21-year-old subsidiary of the America Service Group, already has 125 contracts in 28 states, handling medical care for 175,000 inmates. But the New York City contract would be the largest for the company, which has seen its sales, expected to be about $400 million this year, triple in the last two years, said Bruce A. Teal, its chief financial officer.</p>
        <p>The rapid expansion has not come without some troubles. In Illinois, Georgia and Maine, the company has at times been unable to hire enough nurses and other employees to meet demands, resulting in fines or contract termination, officials in those states said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''It is a critical issue, to have the medical staff in the jail,'' said Thomas K. Janaes, chief of administration at the DuPage County (Ill.) Sheriff's Office, which discontinued a contract with Prison Health Services earlier this year. ''And the company was not able to do it.''</p>
        <p>City officials said late yesterday that they were aware of the sporadic criticism, but a committee of city officials that broadly examined the company's record expressed confidence that with proper staff and supervision, Prison Health Services would improve health care services in the city's jails.</p>
        <p>''It is pretty much impossible to deal with any kind of an urban jail system and not have some kind of a complaint or another,'' said Ernesto Marrero, executive director of Correctional Health Services, the city unit that oversees jail care and is negotiating the new contract.</p>
        <p>Prison Health, which still needs to negotiate the formal terms of the contract with city, was competing with Capital Health Management of Queen's and St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan, which had teamed up with Correctional Medical Services of St. Louis, another large private-sector provider of inmate care, officials said. The city hopes to have a final contract signed by early November, with Prison Health taking over medical care on Jan. 1.</p>
        <p>Acute medical and mental health care would still be provided by New York City hospitals, but Prison Health would hire the doctors, nurses and other staff to evaluate and treat inmates at clinics within the jails.</p>
        <p>Prison Health Services, with some exceptions, has received positive evaluations regarding medical care in recent years, but at times it has had trouble hiring enough staff.</p>
        <p>In Cumberland County in Maine, inmate grievances have increased sharply since the contract started in September 1999, and some prisoners failed to receive proper medication because of a shortage of nurses, said Richard J. Gagliano, chief deputy at the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office. The county is moving to terminate the two-year contract. ''It is an emergency situation, a crisis,'' Mr. Gagliano said yesterday. ''We did not expect this when we signed the contract.''</p>
        <p>In Georgia, where the company had 30,000 inmates in 60 prisons until last year, it was fined for not maintaining adequate staff, said William P. Kissel, director of health services at Georgia Department of Corrections, although he was ultimately satisfied with the company's services. ''They did an honest and good job while they were with us, and they left with dignity and integrity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teal of Prison Health did not dispute the complaints. ''There are areas at times where it is very difficult to maintain the quality of staff we want to maintain,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the company has won accolades as well, such as in Indiana, where all of the state's prisons gained accreditation from the National Commission on Correctional Healthcare, and Prison Health said it had saved the state $26 million over three years, in part by cutting hospital visits.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jane Zimmerman, senior vice president for communications at the New York City Hospitals and Health Care Corporation, which coordinates inmate health care, said city officials would monitor Prison Health performance closely. ''We are convinced they are up to the job,'' she said.</p>
