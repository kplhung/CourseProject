        <p>Ricardo Juarez, one of six American boxers to convincingly win his opening fight in the Olympic boxing tournament, has a catch phrase for how the United States team prepared in the last two months: train high, live low.</p>
        <p>With half the team yet to fight, no American has had a close bout and each has looked stronger as his fight went on.</p>
        <p>Their success, they say, is attributed to two months of intensive high-altitude training at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs.</p>
        <p>''You work hard together, you eat together, you go back to your rooms,'' Jeff Lacy, the middleweight who stopped the Brazilian Cleiton Conceicao, said today after two punishing rounds. ''It was tough and demanding. It was no summer camp.''</p>
        <p>With the new Olympic boxing format of four two-minute rounds in mind, Tom Mustin, the United States coach, took advantage of the Colorado altitude. Besides the usual sparring and workouts, Mustin had each boxer run a 600-meter loop four times with little break between the runs.</p>
        <p>''They had to run the 600 meters, in altitude, in two minutes -- the length of a round,'' Mustin said today. ''Everything was geared to the four rounds of a bout.''</p>
        <p>The boxers also consulted a sports psychologist and spent almost all their time together.</p>
        <p>''Twelve is a big group of guys in one place doing the same thing,'' said Juarez, who has won his last 65 fights. ''But two months up there is a long time. We became a team.''</p>
        <p>The work has paid off and the togetherness has been readily evident in the cozy temporary boxing site at Sydney's Exhibition Center.</p>
        <p>Lacy, Juarez and the welterweight Dante Craig amassed such commanding leads on the judges' cards that their fights were stopped under Olympic rules. The light-flyweight Brian Viloria earned a tough first-round victory over the European champion Sergei Kazakov, while the lightweight David Jackson and the bantamweight Clarence Vinson won by overwhelming double-digit margins.</p>
        <p>And clamoring to get seats near the action, the American boxers have watched one another's fights, sometimes rushing from the shower to ringside to do so.</p>
        <p>''It's a diverse group,'' Mustin said of the team, whose members weigh from 106 to 201 pounds and range in age from 19 to 29. ''And they get on each other. But I see them all pulling for each other now.</p>
        <p>''This is a great beginning: 6 for 6. I think that's going to motivate the other guys now because nobody wants to be the first one to lose. They'll fight their hearts out to help keep the streak going.''</p>
        <p>The featherweight Juarez, the world champion in the 125-pound division, shut out his Iranian opponent, Bijan Batmani, today, registering 15 punches landed to none for Batmani by early in the third round. When an Olympic boxer gains a 15-point lead on his opponent, the referee stops the fight.</p>
        <p>Lacy did much the same in his bout, only in two rounds. He is the hardest puncher on the United States team, with a crunching left hook. But he is not one of the team's better-known fighters, not a reigning world champion like Viloria or Juarez, and not generally listed as a medal contender.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be anybody's favorite,'' Lacy said. ''I want to catch these guys with their hands down.''</p>
        <p>That will be hard to do after today's intimidating performance.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, I should strike some fear in these middleweights,'' Lacy said.</p>
        <p>Every American, like the Cuban boxers who have also dominated the preliminaries, will get his notice now. The United States and Cuba, as expected, have been the class of the tournament so far.</p>
        <p>''These guys have worked very seriously,'' Mustin said. ''I hate to say it, but every one of these guys is thinking about the gold medal.''</p>
        <p>The Cubans, meanwhile, have intentionally kept a lower profile, their secrecy legendary in these Olympic boxing tournaments. But Cuban newspapers reported an interesting detail about the team's final preparations last month. The boxers had sought higher altitudes to train.</p>
