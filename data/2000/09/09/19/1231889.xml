        <p>For officials holding the purse strings in this financially strapped city, the numbers are cause for concern: in the last four years, 415 Hartford city employees have undergone cosmetic laser eye surgery, a procedure fully covered by their generous union-negotiated health plans, at a cost of $1.4 million, records show.</p>
        <p>But in a city that offers -- reluctantly -- the rare perquisite to about 7,000 current and retired employees, the cosmetic procedure could wind up costing Hartford several million dollars, city officials said.</p>
        <p>Nearly 400 of the 415 laser eye operations performed on city employees since 1996 were done in the last 14 months, according to figures supplied to city officials last week by the insurer, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Connecticut. As more doctors continue to offer and advertise the service, Hartford officials expect many more nearsighted employees to seek the procedure.</p>
        <p>The employees' health plan was never meant to cover laser eye surgery, city officials said. But when the city moved from being self-insured to contracting with Anthem to provide major medical benefits in 1991, radial keratotomy, the precursor to contemporary laser eye surgery, was carried over from the old policy.</p>
        <p>No one predicted that the keratotomy clause would become the basis for employees to claim laser eye surgery as a benefit. But it has.</p>
        <p>Between July 1 and Sept. 14, for instance, 116 city employees had the eye surgery, at a total cost of $378,348, Anthem's data shows. At that rate, the benefit could cost the city $1.8 million this fiscal year.</p>
        <p>''It certainly has cost us money,'' the city manager, Saundra Kee Borges, said today. ''I don't think we've seen the end of it by any means.''</p>
        <p>Anthem pays the cost of the operations, at an average of $3,418.41 per person, but those costs will likely be passed on to the city in the form of higher insurance premiums, said Gene Surrett, Hartford's health benefits manager.</p>
        <p>The city is one of the poorest in the Northeast, and the surgical procedure is usually not medically necessary. Last year, Anthem raised its health insurance premium by $7 million, Ms. Kee Borges said.</p>
        <p>Most nearsighted patients seeking the procedure have it done on both eyes. But Anthem's coverage allows city employees to have only one eye corrected at a time, said Debra Smith, the marketing director for Fichman Eye Center in Manchester, which has performed the procedure on about 80 Hartford employees. They must come back a day or two later for the other eye, she said.</p>
        <p>In December, city officials hope to learn how much Anthem will increase the annual premium starting in July 2001, the start of Hartford's fiscal year, Mr. Surrett said. But he said he expected the number to decline.</p>
