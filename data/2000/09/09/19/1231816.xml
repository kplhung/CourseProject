        <p>Editor's Note: headline of September 18 Business Day article on rise of Fox News Network and its efforts to combat perception that it advances conservative political agenda exceeded facts in article by attributing general political viewpoint to network</p>

        <p>An article in Business Day yesterday reported on the rise of the Fox News Network and its efforts to combat a perception that it advances a conservative political agenda. The article quoted Fox executives who said they sought to present fair and balanced news coverage.</p>
        <p>In editing, however, the article was headlined ''The Right Strategy for Fox: Conservative Cable Channel Gains in Ratings War.'' In attributing a general political viewpoint to the network, the headline exceeded the facts in the article.</p>
