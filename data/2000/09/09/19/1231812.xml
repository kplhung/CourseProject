        <p>Conceptually, Sunday in New York resembles a giant playpen for the infantile ego. It is the one day, especially during Fashion Week, when all the arty kids come out in their homemade clothes, and there are not too many old people around to give them grief. Everyone is creative. Everyone is feeling -- how can one put it after seeing the Imitation of Christ show amid the rose-colored solemnity of the Peter Jarema Funeral Home on East Seventh Street? -- a oneness with Chloe Sevigny.</p>
        <p>The ultra-aloof Ms. Sevigny, sitting front and center, was wearing a pair of crisp black jeans with high heels and a gray sweatshirt with the sleeves pushed up to her elbows, and she had on one of those yachting caps that you'd imagine Aristotle Onassis wearing as he chased Maria Callas around on the sunny decks.</p>

        <p>Conceptually, Sunday in New York resembles a giant playpen for the infantile ego. It is the one day, especially during Fashion Week, when all the arty kids come out in their homemade clothes, and there are not too many old people around to give them grief. Everyone is creative. Everyone is feeling -- how can one put it after seeing the Imitation of Christ show amid the rose-colored solemnity of the Peter Jarema Funeral Home on East Seventh Street? -- a oneness with Chloe Sevigny.</p>
        <p>The ultra-aloof Ms. Sevigny, sitting front and center, was wearing a pair of crisp black jeans with high heels and a gray sweatshirt with the sleeves pushed up to her elbows, and she had on one of those yachting caps that you'd imagine Aristotle Onassis wearing as he chased Maria Callas around on the sunny decks.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sevigny is an actress, but she is also a kind of muse, and the fact that she is creative director of Imitation of Christ, a line begun less than a year ago by Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave, using old frocks resurrected from the bins of Goodwill, should cause a chuckle in fashion's upper regions, where being a creative director usually means doing more than deciding which old Scaasi to cut up.</p>
        <p>And yet, think about it -- think what it means in an era of celebrity rule and big-brand uniformity to have a garment that is not only one of a kind (because Goodwill isn't exactly Bergdorf's), but also approved and possibly even worn by Ms. Sevigny herself. Where else can a person achieve such . . . oneness?</p>
        <p>So the women's spring 2001 collections have begun with the kids playing in the corner and the adults, the establishment designers, doing their best not to take any of this too seriously. And doing their best to last. That is why people used to get into the fashion business -- to make money, yes, but also to last, to endure season after season. If they are lucky, like Diane Von Furstenberg, whose show on Sunday night combined a knowing sophistication with the frivolously sexy, they even get a second wind.</p>
        <p>Ms. Von Furstenberg is not a great designer. Her clothes are simple, and this season she sent out a lot of clingy tops with side ruching and dresses in gingham or abstract prints, sometimes with matching panties. But she is good at doing what great designers do, which is to exploit a look so that, year by year, it becomes her own.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt that Pamela Dennis takes seriously the business of making evening clothes, though her show yesterday in the tents at Bryant Park was so heavy on icy satin and rhinestones that it was easy to overlook her nonchalant gray cardigan over a slim low-slung skirt of matte silver sequins with a fraying hem.</p>
        <p>An hour later, in the adjacent tent, before a crowd that included the usual social suspects as well as Melanie Griffith and her husband, Antonio Banderas, Carolina Herrera made everything look easy. The business of making pretty clothes and filthy lucre in the commercial atmosphere of Seventh Avenue is no burden for her. This season, she showed lanky print blouses and spare knits with culottes and, really, they worked. A chiffon wraparound blouse in pale blue and brown stripes played over culottes in brown tattersall checks. Black hot pants appeared with a tight, off-the-shoulder top in suede, and there were shirt dresses, too, in chevron charmeuse stripes or in just plain black. Mrs. Herrera is fundamentally that most grown-up of designers.</p>
        <p>And this is what makes one question the sincerity of designers like Ms. Subkoff and Mr. Damhave of Imitation of Christ. It's true that their things were gorgeous and enchanting, and they are even right to be a little appalled at the way the fashion business spits out more and more clothes. But where will their recycled clothes take them in the end? On the one hand, they want to give people clothes imbued with individuality and that circumvent the normal production process. And yet if they haven't worked out the real, practical concerns of running a fashion house, such as sizing, that individuality will shackle them. What they'll end up with is a one-of-a-kind business.</p>
        <p>It sometimes seems as if young designers, especially in New York, work themselves into a cul-de-sac of creativity, and then can't find their way out. Susan Cianciolo is one designer who has struggled to put her point of view across, and she has her followers -- like Dakota Goldhor, a film student at Bard College, who was helping out at Ms. Cianciolo's presentation on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I mean, I, like, worshiped Susan when I was 15 or 16, and I'd see her clothes in avant-garde magazines,'' said Ms. Goldhor, now 20, as she demonstrated one of Ms. Cianciolo's do-it-yourself fashion kits for shoes and skirts and so forth. As a pianist played Chopin hotly, Ms. Goldhor explained that the point of the kits, which included thread and buttons, was to ''encourage people to take charge of their own appearance.''</p>
        <p>A novel idea, even a charming one, but Ms. Cianciolo's raw talent somehow needs to find a wider avenue.</p>
        <p>Alice Roi, one of the new designers who presented her collection in the Moet &amp; Chandon group show on Sunday, seems to have both talent and ambition -- and a good eye for what's happening on the street. Moving away from last season's ladylike pantsuits, she embraced a kind of cutie-pie look, with flaring minis and chiffon-y tops that showed the influence of Jeremy Scott.</p>
        <p>Anyone who had not seen Miguel Adrover's first two collections would probably think that the many blazers, golf shirts and pressed trousers he showed on Sunday night were an homage to Talbot's. ''That was the most deliciously perverse fashion show I've ever seen,'' Simon Doonan, creative director of Barneys, said afterward.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adrover's collection was indeed perversely all-American. He seemed to have strayed into Ralph Lauren country, with a detour through a Memorial Day parade. And yet Mr. Adrover is on to something. Like the young designers of United Bamboo, he is simply presenting a different take on American life. Here is the classic button-down shirt, but now made smaller and with a Western yoke. Here is the sailor suit, the Boy Scout uniform, but seen through the eyes of someone who has never worn either. Mr. Adrover didn't abandon the brash creativity he displayed when he was poor and had no financing. He found tailoring, and a line, a look, that he could endlessly exploit. That is grown-up business.</p>
