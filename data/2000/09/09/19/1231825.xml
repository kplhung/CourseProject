      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial, commenting on Gov George W Bush's new strategy to woo middle class, says he faces difficult task of getting arrythmic campaign back into steady beat before he is typecast as Republican version of Michael Dukakis, Democratic nominee in 1988 (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's task for the next week or so is simple. He has to get his arrhythmic campaign back on a steady beat before he gets typecast as a Republican version of Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988. For a long time, Mr. Bush counted on his personality and his promise to restore ''honor and dignity'' to undermine public regard for Vice President Al Gore. But now that he is behind, Mr. Bush plans to battle on issues outlined in his new ''Blueprint for the Middle Class,'' such as his proposed tax cuts, education reforms and plans to overhaul Medicare and Social Security. This may well be the right strategy, but it will not be an easy one. Not only is this Mr. Gore's preferred terrain, but on most of these subjects, polls show that voters favor Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Bush will now get a chance to be specific about compassionate conservatism, yet the debate will almost certainly be less about philosophy than about who gets what benefits. Mr. Gore has made headway because he has been able to show that his programs benefit middle-income families, while Mr. Bush's policies seem tailored to corporate interests and the well-to-do.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's task for the next week or so is simple. He has to get his arrhythmic campaign back on a steady beat before he gets typecast as a Republican version of Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee in 1988. For a long time, Mr. Bush counted on his personality and his promise to restore ''honor and dignity'' to undermine public regard for Vice President Al Gore. But now that he is behind, Mr. Bush plans to battle on issues outlined in his new ''Blueprint for the Middle Class,'' such as his proposed tax cuts, education reforms and plans to overhaul Medicare and Social Security. This may well be the right strategy, but it will not be an easy one. Not only is this Mr. Gore's preferred terrain, but on most of these subjects, polls show that voters favor Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Bush will now get a chance to be specific about compassionate conservatism, yet the debate will almost certainly be less about philosophy than about who gets what benefits. Mr. Gore has made headway because he has been able to show that his programs benefit middle-income families, while Mr. Bush's policies seem tailored to corporate interests and the well-to-do.</p>
        <p>On prescription drugs for Medicare, for example, Mr. Bush would use federal funding to encourage competition among private health care plans, an approach that Mr. Gore says would amount to a giveaway to insurance companies. The governor's assumption on these proposals seems to be that voters will see him as a champion of markets and Mr. Gore as a fan of big government. But it is by no means clear that the voters Mr. Bush needs -- say, retirees in Florida -- dislike Washington Medicare bureaucrats more than the benefits bureaucrats at the insurance companies.</p>
        <p>No matter how inventive Mr. Bush becomes in proposing changes in the basic New Deal and Great Society safety net, he has yet to explain how he will pay for what he wants to do if he proceeds with a tax cut estimated to cost nearly $2 trillion over 10 years. True, that proposal helped him in the Republican primaries when he was running against Senator John McCain. But even his fellow Republican derided it as too heavily weighted toward the rich, and now Mr. Gore has countered with a plan of limited tax cuts tailored to the middle-class concerns such as helping families pay for college. Mr. Gore's plan has been criticized as a fiscal patchwork, but its sales pitch has a broader appeal.</p>
        <p>If the tax cut drives the whole debate toward a choice between which programs benefit which classes of people, Republicans will deplore the dangers of class warfare. But class resentments have long been a staple of American politics, from the late 19th century to the presidential race in the new production of Gore Vidal's play ''The Best Man.'' So have the kind of income-distribution and retirement security concerns that Mr. Bush will be touching on when he takes to the stump with his tax, Social Security and Medicare proposals. The polls show why the governor felt he had to shift gears before the October debates, but it is hard to see exactly where the voter payoff comes in an argument with Mr. Gore over bread-and-butter issues in the swing states.</p>
