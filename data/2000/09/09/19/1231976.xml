        <p>Even though Lou Lamoriello stopped negotiations with Scott Niedermayer and Jason Arnott several days ago, the two players say they have not reached the stage of asking the president and a general manager of the Devils for a trade.</p>
        <p>Niedermayer said it himself last night, speaking from his home in British Columbia in a conference call with his agent, Don Meehan, who also represents Arnott and spoke on Arnott's behalf.</p>
        <p>''I'm not thinking about that right now,'' Niedermayer said regarding a trade. ''How can you ask for a trade after winning the Stanley Cup?''</p>
        <p>Speaking from Toronto, Meehan said: ''Today, I can speak for Jason and I can tell you that I have no such instructions from Jason. Scotty and Jason have given me a mandate of what would be fair, and I have presented that.''</p>
        <p>Niedermayer said he told Lamoriello last week how extremely disappointed he was about Lamoriello's stance on negotiations. ''I think I deserve a little better treatment,'' Niedermayer said.</p>
        <p>If Niedermayer accepts the Devils' proposal, which includes bonuses, he will end up with the third-highest salary on the Devils behind Martin Brodeur, who will make $4.38 million this year, and Scott Stevens, who will make $4.15 million. Alexander Mogilny will earn $5.2 million this season, but the Vancouver Canucks are responsible for a big chunk of that amount.</p>
