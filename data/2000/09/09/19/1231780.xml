        <p>It is not just extensive habitat loss nor is it just poaching for its plush pelt that is doing in the giant panda. It is also evolution. Evolution simply has not done right by one of the world's most popular animals, now a critically endangered species with only about a thousand believed to exist in the wild.</p>
        <p>Start with the fact that female pandas, which live isolated from males in dense bamboo forests in China, have but two or three fertile days a year and must rely on chemical advertising across the thickets to attract an equally reclusive male. Then, if an egg is successfully fertilized, a 16-cell embryo just floats free in the womb for one to five months before it implants in the uterus and starts developing.</p>
        <p>And long before any other mammal would consider it time to be born, out pops a half-developed creature, four or five ounces of blind helplessness to be cared for by a 200-pound momma, who, if she is not extraordinarily gentle and devoted, can easily crush her newborn. If human mothers and babies  had the same weight ratio, a 120-pound woman would give birth to a two-and-a-half-ounce baby. Or, put another way, the mother of a seven-and-a-half-pound baby would weigh about 6,000 pounds.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, if a panda gives birth to twins, which occurs in nearly half of all births, she she must abandon one of them, because it is all she can do to care for the one hapless infant she must cradle to her chest for weeks on end. In captivity, panda moms sometimes display little or no maternal instinct, leaving their babies little chance of survival.</p>
        <p>No one yet knows how well panda mothers do in the wild, though before China's exploding human population seriously disrupted the pandas' bamboo jungles, the species managed to survive well enough for millions of years.</p>
        <p>China has made some valiant efforts in recent years to save the giant panda from extinction by establishing 32 reserves to protect wild pandas and bringing 120 adults into a captive breeding program. But it has not had the expertise to nurture  captive pandas or the money to protect the reserves, manage the wild population and rescue this flagship species from the list of seriously endangered animals.</p>
        <p>Enter the San Diego Zoo, a well-endowed institution with a multidisciplinary scientific staff used to such challenges and a cadre of volunteers willing to help gather the data on this mysterious animal and its even more mysterious reproductive system.</p>
        <p>In exchange for $1 million a year to foster panda research and conservation within China, in 1996 two adult giant pandas, Bai Yun (a female) and Shi Shi (a male), were shipped to the zoo's Pacific Bell Giant Panda Research Station on a 12-year loan.  After three challenging years, zoo scientists managed to increase the world's population of pandas by one.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 21, 1999, 135 days after she was artificially inseminated with sperm from Shi Shi, Bai Yun gave birth to a baby no bigger than a stick of butter. Cradled against her mother, the newborn panda resembled a worm with limbs.</p>
        <p>A year later, though, Hua Mei celebrated her first birthday, a robust 60-pound cub seemingly oblivious to the fact that she is the first giant panda in a decade to be born outside of China and the first to survive in the United States.</p>
        <p>The birthday party for Hua Mei, which means China U.S.A., attracted 12,000 visitors. But the real celebration was behind the scenes, where two Chinese scientists, a reproductive physiologist, endocrinologist, nutritionist, horticulturist, analytic chemist, animal behaviorist, video specialist, veterinarians and keepers had collaborated to make panda history. Next year, armed with experience, a ream of data and permission from China to use Shi Shi's sperm again, the team hopes to repeat their success when Bai Yun stops nursing and ovulates once more.</p>
        <p>Despite the publicity given to Hua Mei's birth, the most important achievements have occurred in China, where scientists from the San Diego Zoo's Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Species have long collaborated with Chinese scientists to improve the success of captive breeding. The researchers worked to enhance the animals' physical and psychological health, foster their chemical communication and develop infant formulas more like natural panda milk.</p>
        <p>Combined with a swapping system the Chinese scientists devised for panda twins -- one twin is given temporarily to its panda mother while the other is fed formula and cradled by a furry, artificial mom --  the breeding program at the Wolong Nature Preserve in Sichuan has had unprecedented success the last two years.</p>
        <p>So far this year at Wolong, nine pandas have been born, including four to mothers that never before gave birth, and a record eight babies have survived the crucial first weeks of life. And there may be more births this breeding season. Since it is not possible without a sonogram to know for sure when a panda is pregnant, the Chinese scientists instead carefully monitor hormone levels in the female's urine to know if and when a birth may be imminent.</p>
        <p>The San Diego team, which trained Bai Yun to submit to an ultrasound exam, was unable to confirm her pregnancy until three days before Hua Mei was born. A videocamera placed in her den months earlier documented the birth, but not because the tiny infant could be seen under Bai Yun's huge paw. Rather, Hua Mei let her mother and the world know she had arrived by letting out a loud squawk.</p>
        <p>The team remained ready to rescue the infant and hand-raise her if Bai Yun's maternal instincts failed, but the new mother turned out to be an excellent parent, never putting the baby down for five days before she finally took a two-minute break to get her first postpartum drink. It was another nine days before Bai Yun, whose name means white cloud, interrupted infant care long enough to get something to eat.</p>
        <p>The zoo's staff did what it could to keep Bai Yun's stress level to a minimum. Dr. Barbara Durrant, the zoo's reproductive physiologist, believes stress contributed to the failure of a previous suspected pregnancy of Bai Yun. Accordingly, near the panda den, all zoo construction, mechanical street sweeping, bus traffic and other sources of noise were halted for two to three months before and after the birth. Zoo veterinarians resisted handling the baby for two weeks, until Bai Yun finally left her long enough to allow her to be weighed, examined and pronounced normal and healthy. Since Bai Yun has a strong bond with her keepers, Kathy Hawk and Kim Bacon, she was not perturbed when they wrapped the noisy infant in a towel and whisked her away for the brief exam.</p>
        <p>''We were on pins and needles for weeks because there's such a high infant mortality rate for these tiny infants,'' Dr. Durrant said. In captivity about half die, and until Hua Mei no panda born in North America had lived more than five days.</p>
        <p>As solitary animals that cannot see and usually cannot hear one another, pandas have a highly developed sense of smell and mainly communicate through chemical signals: the male through a huge scent gland under the tail, the female through her scent gland and chemicals in her urine. A female coming into heat widely deposits chemical messages from urine, announcing her approaching fertility.</p>
        <p>Males use urine-borne signals too. Dr. Lee Hagey, the zoo's analytic chemist, said they urinate into their front paws and rub it on their black ears. ''Then they sit up tall and let the sun volatilize their chemical message,'' Dr. Hagey said.</p>
        <p>He explained: ''The panda in the wild is surrounded by something like a cornfield. Using only its eyes and ears it wouldn't know about anything five feet away. But, in fact, the giant panda knows what is going on within miles around him because he can smell it. The panda's brain has a huge olfactory region.'' Dr. Hagey has shown that each animal's scent is composed of a unique chemical mixture that would enable individual animals to recognize one another.</p>
        <p>Using a mass spectrometer to analyze panda scents, he showed they are highly complex mixtures. ''A male marking territory applies a waxy goo like a roll-on deodorant to keep the scent alive for the months it can take to patrol his whole territory,'' he said. The female's scent is also complex but need not be long-lasting, since she has only to advertise her current reproductive status.</p>
        <p>In studies in China, where he spends three or four months a year, Dr. Ron R. Swaisgood, an animal behaviorist at the zoo, has discovered that pandas establish ''scent-marking stations -- a kind of community bulletin board where all pandas in the neighborhood go to find out about their neighbors.'' Using scents, his studies revealed, pandas can distinguish males from females, recognize individuals and even detect how old a scent mark is. If a scent signaling a female in heat is more than a few days old, the male has no need to respond, Dr. Swaisgood explained.</p>
        <p>For weeks before Bai Yun ovulated, she excreted chemical signals indicating that her fertile time was near. Bai Yun and Shi Shi were repeatedly exposed to each other's scents before they were brought together. But Shi Shi, whose name means rock, showed no sexual interest in Bai Yun, even though she made her interest clear. This was not a surprise. ''About 80 percent of males in captivity fail to respond appropriately to females,'' said Dr. Don Lindburg, leader of the panda research team.</p>
        <p>This left the San Diego scientists with little choice but to try artificial insemination. They monitored Bai Yun's hormone levels daily to find the best time.</p>
        <p>Then, for months, they could only hope and wait. Nothing happens during the delay in implantation, which in Bai Yun's case lasted 80 days. The one-to-five-month delay between conception and implantation renders the timing of a panda birth highly unpredictable, and even rising progesterone levels in the female's urine, which normally appear after implantation, could be a sign of a pseudopregnancy, Dr. Durrant said.</p>
        <p>Just days before Hua Mei's birth, a sonogram revealed the tiny fetus's beating heart, spine and tail.</p>
        <p>During his visits to Wolong, Dr. Swaisgood noticed that the center's captive pandas often engaged in abnormal repetitive behaviors like pacing and head tossing, signs of boredom and stress that could inhibit reproduction. He helped the Chinese scientists develop an ''enrichment program'' to spark the pandas' interest in their environment, keep their minds occupied, improve their mood and, it was hoped, boost their interest in procreation. Simple, accessible, inexpensive ''toys'' were introduced into the panda enclosures: tree branches, burlap sacks stuffed with straw, fruit-laden ice pops, apple pieces stuffed into bamboo.</p>
        <p>''Enrichment had a lot of positive effects on the animals' psychological well-being,'' Dr. Swaisgood said. ''We saw a dramatic reduction in stereotyped behaviors, an increase in diverse activities and less anxiety over when the next meal was to arrive. We think this is fostering better mating behavior and maternal care.''</p>
        <p>Still, despite their tuxedo-like attire, pandas are not exactly party animals. Most of their life is spent eating, sleeping and defecating -- upward of 50 times a day. Bamboo, their preferred food, has little nutritive value; only 17 percent of it is digested and absorbed, so most is wasted. The zoo must provide about 21 tons of bamboo a year for its two adult pandas, an amount that will soon rise by 50 percent when Hua Mei starts regularly eating bamboo.</p>
        <p>It is a forbidding horticultural task, managed by Jon Updike, the zoo's ''browse'' specialist, who harvests the animals' preferred bamboo species from zoo plantings. Luckily, San Diego's climate is ideal for growing this highly specialized diet.</p>
        <p>Also forbidding is what China must do to preserve this species in the wild. Two more long-term loans of pandas -- a pair to Zoo Atlanta and another pair soon to go to the National Zoo in Washington -- will add $24 million to conservation coffers in China.</p>
        <p>It is not just pandas that will benefit. Dr. Swaisgood noted, ''Pandas live in a rich, biodiverse ecosystem, so if China succeeds in conserving panda habitat, many other species will come under its protective umbrella, including the golden monkey,  red panda, Asiatic golden cat, clouded leopard, takin (a relative of the musk ox), five species of pheasants, a lot of beautiful songbirds, a tremendous variety of butterflies and moths and lots of different plants.''</p>
