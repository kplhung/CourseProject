        <p>Defense Secretary William S. Cohen warned Indonesia today that this troubled country could face severe diplomatic and economic reprisals if it did not disband militia groups accused of killings and of causing havoc in the divided island of Timor.</p>
        <p>In meetings here today with President Abdurrahman Wahid and other top officials, Mr. Cohen expressed grave disappointment that Indonesia had failed to disarm the pro-Jakarta militia that is accused of killing three unarmed United Nations aid workers, including an American, on Sept. 6 in West Timor.</p>
        <p>Indonesia promised to move quickly to bring those responsible for the killings to justice. No arrests have been made, and none of the police officers and Indonesian military responsible for the security of the United Nations workers have been disciplined.</p>
        <p>''Failure to do so will have consequences for Jakarta's relations with the international community, and could jeopardize continued economic assistance to Indonesia,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''Indonesia faces a momentous decision.''</p>
        <p>Indonesia has been plagued by widespread violence in the last year, as it struggles to forge a new democracy after three decades of dictatorship under President Suharto, who stepped down in 1998. But with growing secessionist movements, a faltering economy, a rebellious military and recent bombings in Jakarta, the government has at times seemed overwhelmed by the task before it.</p>
        <p>Frustrated that the police have failed to identify a single suspect in a series of bombings here, Mr. Wahid today dismissed the national chief, Gen. Rusdihardjo, and replaced him with his deputy, Lt. Gen. Bimantoro.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's remarks were the strongest yet by the United States about the militias, which last year waged a week of killing and rioting across East Timor after residents had overwhelmingly voted for independence in a United Nations-sponsored referendum. The vote freed East Timor from 24 years of harsh occupation by Indonesian troops, and the Indonesian military was accused of creating and supporting the militia groups to destabilize the situation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said he had received assurances from Mr. Wahid and other leaders that the government would move swiftly to disband the militias, which operate on the side of the divided island that is still part of Indonesia. The militia groups are accused of harassing aid workers who are trying to repatriate some of the 120,000 East Timorese refugees who fled to camps in West Timor last year.</p>
        <p>Asked what specific actions the United States would take if Indonesia failed to rein in the West Timor militia, Mr. Cohen, who is on a six-nation Asian tour, declined to speculate, but said:</p>
        <p>''What takes place in the next few weeks will determine what the response will be. There cannot be delays or deferrals or in any way to seek to stretch this out. This is something that must be addressed in the immediate future.''</p>
        <p>But the Indonesian defense minister, Mohammad Mahfud Mahmodin, told reporters after meeting Mr. Cohen that Washington's decision to end military ties with Indonesia had deprived the Indonesian military of equipment that it needs to subdue the Timorese militias.</p>
        <p>The United States ended military assistance to Indonesia after the East Timor rampage.</p>
