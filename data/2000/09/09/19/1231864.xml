        <p>NOW that his rambling  days are over  at least on WOR-AM, where he followed his father and grandfather beneath the ''on the air'' sign -- John R. Gambling has more than enough time to chat while sitting on the deck of his home here. No more worrying about finishing a sentence in less than a minute. No more cutting himself off at 9 a.m. sharp. But Mr. Gambling's voice sounds the same as always, even without a microphone.</p>
        <p>''I led a pretty ordinary life, a pretty common life,'' said Mr. Gambling, hands folded, sentences complete. ''Only my schedule was a little different than everybody else's.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, for the last 15 years, Mr. Gambling, longtime host of WOR's ''Rambling With Gambling,'' has been following the sleep-crippling regimen of morning radio, a calling that required Mr. Gambling to rise at 3 a.m., be at work at 4 and go on the air at 5. After four hours, it usually was back home, a quick nap, perhaps a school function or a family dinner, and then back in bed by 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>That schedule, however, took a slight turn toward the lax last Monday morning when Mr. Gambling, much to the shock of his listeners, announced that he would be leaving the air that very day after learning that WOR's management would not renew his contract.</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Gambling says, he has been besieged by e-mail, letters and calls from everyone from childhood friends to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Other stations have inquired about his services, as have car dealerships hungry for a celebrity spokesman. All in all, he says, he has been ''interviewed, spun and mulled'' more times than he can count.</p>
        <p>''I assume that Britney Spears gets these kinds of things happening to her, but a 50-year-old radio guy sure as heck doesn't,'' Mr. Gambling said. ''I mean, I do not look good in hip huggers.''</p>
        <p>Luckily, hip huggers aren't exactly an occupational necessity. What Mr. Gambling has instead is a mellow baritone and the calm, measured cadence of an airline pilot, traits that made his good-natured, ''family-oriented'' show something of an anomaly in the usually raucous world of morning radio. (By comparison, the morning Mr. Gambling finished his program, Howard Stern featured a discussion of Jennifer Lopez's figure and a chat with Jessica Hahn.)</p>
        <p>''I think what listeners found in me was a place they felt really, really comfortable and that they knew was going to be there every morning,'' Mr. Gambling said. ''A warm, fuzzy area that was there to plug into.''</p>
        <p>AS popular as Mr. Gambling may have been, part of the reason for the outpouring of support certainly has to do with the history of his show. ''Rambling With Gambling'' had been a staple of New York morning radio since 1925, when Mr. Gambling's grandfather, John B. Gambling, went on the air with a mix of news and amiable chatter.</p>
        <p>In 1959, Mr. Gambling's father, John A. Gambling, took over after apprenticing on the air with John B. Gambling, thereby securing the family franchise just as television began to eclipse radio as the mass-market medium of choice.</p>
        <p>By that point, the youngest Gambling had already been introduced to listeners. At 5, in 1955, he helped recite ''The Night Before Christmas'' while sitting on his father's lap.</p>
        <p>After several years of working in minor-league radio towns like Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Hyde Park, N.Y., Mr. Gambling moved to New York in 1978 as a staff announcer at WOR. Before long, he had his own weekend show.</p>
        <p>In 1985 Mr. Gambling, 35, joined his father at the microphone. He became the lone host of the show in 1990, when his father retired.</p>
        <p>Along the way, the Gamblings maintained both their unbroken streak on the air -- 23,316 shows, by Mr. Gambling's count -- and its increasingly anachronistic atmosphere of civility. In typical fashion, Mr. Gambling's last on-air sign off was understated. ''I think my last words were something along the lines of 'It's been a lot of fun, thanks very much, stay tuned,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Off the air, his comments were slightly more pointed.</p>
        <p>''I'll be honest with you: I didn't expect this to happen at all,'' Mr. Gambling said. ''I had had one conversation two or three months ago with the general manager, who made a mention that maybe we should look somewhere else. But I'd had heard this before. It's negotiation time, after all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gambling's sense of surprise deepened yesterday, he said, when he learned that his replacement in the morning slot would be Ed Walsh, a former director of news and programming at WOR and current morning host in Phoenix. His show will begin on Oct. 2.</p>
        <p>''They told me they wanted to go in a different direction,'' he said. ''This doesn't seem to be that.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Gambling's direction, he is examining his options. He is married and has three boys, and he has been extremely active at his children's school, the Friends Academy, where he says he intends to spend more time. He has just taken up golf, and says his house also needs a new coat of paint.</p>
        <p>And as for a job, he says he is looking at all sorts of offers, from other radio shows to a new career altogether, maybe even something with a slightly later start time.</p>
        <p>''You know, getting up at 3 o'clock in the morning is not one of the great joys, especially in February,'' he said. ''So if there's some way to find an alternative to that it wouldn't be all bad.''</p>
        <p>He paused and added: ''But, you know, in the end, I'm still kind of a morning person.''</p>
        <p>PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  September 26, 2000, Tuesday  The Public Lives profile last Tuesday about John R. Gambling, whose longtime radio program ''Rambling With Gambling'' on WOR-AM was recently canceled, misstated the title of the poem by Clement Clarke Moore that Mr. Gambling helped to recite on the program at age 5 when his father was the host. It is ''A Visit From St. Nicholas''; it is popularly known as ''The Night Before Christmas.''</p>
