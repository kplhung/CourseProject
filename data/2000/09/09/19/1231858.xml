        <p>After trying for months to avoid disclosing his charitable contributions, Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic Senate candidate, revealed today that he had given more than $100,000 to groups whose leaders or sponsors later endorsed him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, the multimillionaire who spent $35 million in winning the Democratic primary, said those gifts were part of more than $10 million in cash and stock he gave to dozens of charities since the beginning of last year. During that time, he started giving to far more New Jersey charities and organizations.</p>
        <p>He insisted at a news conference today that there was no connection between his charitable donations and his political campaign. But some of the information gave at least the appearance that charitable giving and political support were not entirely unrelated and raised questions about how forthcoming Mr. Corzine has been about his charitable donations.</p>
        <p>In April, for example, 20 members of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey announced their endorsement of Mr. Corzine in the Democratic primary. As Mr. Corzine stood by silently, a reporter asked whether he had contributed to any of the ministers or their churches. Several ministers angrily said the only contribution Mr. Corzine made was what he put in the collection plate when he attended Sunday services.</p>
        <p>But today, Mr. Corzine revealed that four months earlier, his family philanthropy, a private foundation through which he makes most of his charitable donations, had given $25,000 to St. Matthew's A.M.E. Church in Orange, N.J.</p>
        <p>Its pastor, the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, is the executive director of the Black Ministers Council, which has long been important in delivering black political support to Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said today that he had not spoken up during the April event because the question had not been asked specifically about his foundation. ''I answered the question that was asked,'' he said. ''I wasn't trying to deceive anyone.''</p>
        <p>He said today that he had given Mr. Jackson the money to pay for after-school programs and new computers at his church. But Mr. Jackson, reached at his home in Orange, said tonight that most of the money, with Mr. Corzine's approval, went to open a new political office for the ministers' council in Trenton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said he had told the other members of the council that the December donor wanted to remain anonymous. He said he had wanted to avoid influencing their decisions about whom to endorse in the Senate race. ''Looking back on it, I should have spoken up,'' he said, referring to the April endorsement. ''But I didn't, because the funds came from his foundation.''</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Corzine's charitable donations bear no apparent connection to his Senate run. He gave more than $2.1 million to the Morristown-Beard School, where his son, Jeffrey, was a student. And he gave many smaller gifts to charities in and around Summit, N.J., where he lives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said today that his recent donations were consistent with a pattern of giving to groups devoted to children, education, health care, women's rights, racial harmony and the arts. ''Our contributions reflect a strong personal commitment to the same issues and principles that I have chosen to address in my campaign,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Maybe there are one or two things which seem inconsistent with that,'' Mr. Corzine added. ''It's probably my wife's. She has a thing or two going, too.''</p>
        <p>A former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, in New York, Mr. Corzine's giving suddenly shifted from being nationally- and even New York-oriented to being increasingly focused on New Jersey after he became a Senate candidate.</p>
        <p>He gave $150,000 to the Archdiocese of Newark in November. He donated $500 in June 1999 to the North Ward Center Inc., a social service center in Newark headed by Stephen Adubato Sr., one of the city's most influential Democrats. In April, he gave $150,000 to the northern New Jersey chapter of Planned Parenthood. And he gave $25,000 to pay for the African American Heritage festival in Newark in June.</p>
        <p>The records Mr. Corzine released today, under pressure from his Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks, raise questions about at least three other endorsements. On Jan. 25, his foundation wrote a $50,000 check to Operation Rainbow/PUSH, the social-action group of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. On June 5, the night before the primary, Mr. Jackson flew to New Jersey to endorse Mr. Corzine. A spokesman for Rainbow/PUSH declined to comment, and efforts to reach Mr. Jackson tonight were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>In addition, when Mr. Corzine was assiduously courting the support of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, whom he hopes to succeed, Mr. Corzine gave $30,000 for a dinner in honor of Mr. Lautenberg that benefited the Boy Scouts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lautenberg, who endorsed Mr. Corzine in February, said tonight that the December gift had come with ''no strings attached'' and had had no effect on his opinion of Mr. Corzine. All Mr. Corzine offered him, he said, ''was that he'd be more than likely to follow the agenda that I've worked on for these 18 years -- that was the inducement.''</p>
        <p>Finally, in November, Mr. Corzine gave $2,500 to Ceasefire New Jersey, a gun-control group that endorsed him Sept. 8. A spokesman said tonight there was no link between the endorsement and the contribution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks seized on Mr. Corzine's disclosures today and urged him to go further.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, his foundation has made charitable contributions to politically active organizations who have helped his campaign,'' said Charlie Smith, Mr. Franks's spokesman. ''This only increases Jon Corzine's obligation to fully disclose his tax returns for public inspection.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine insists that he is prevented from releasing his tax returns by a confidentiality agreement with Goldman Sachs. But he also added to his political problems by delaying filing the tax return of his private philanthropy, the Jon and Joanne Corzine Foundation.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Corzine said he would request a second three-month extension for that tax return. But on Friday, after a series of Republican officials called on him to relent, he filed the return itself, he said today.</p>
