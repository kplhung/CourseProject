        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In your Sept. 12 Public Lives column about Charles Grodin, you say his talk show, ''The Charles Grodin Show,'' received ''some of the most vicious reviews in television.'' In fairness, it should be noted that overwhelmingly, Mr. Grodin received outstanding reviews.</p>
        <p>The program also received three Cable Ace Award nominations as best cable show and an additional one for best interviewer. It won a best program nomination every year that it was on the air in which there were Cable Ace Awards.</p>
