        <p>Was it the guy fiddling with his trouser button while carrying a briefcase, shopping bag and satchel as he left the men's room at Grand Central Terminal yesterday? Or the man who exited with an open can of diet soda? Circumstantial evidence would seem to exonerate the fellow who hurried out, wringing a paper towel.</p>
        <p>Yet according to a new study, two of them might be guilty. The offense: they did not wash their hands.</p>
        <p>A misdemeanor, perhaps, but according to the American Society for Microbiology, only 43 percent of men who used bathrooms in Grand Central and Pennsylvania Station washed their hands. The figure among women was higher, at 54 percent, the society said.</p>
        <p>Consequences, the society warned, could be dire, from an increase in infectious diseases to germs that are increasingly resistant to antibiotics.</p>
        <p>The observational study, conducted in well-trafficked bathrooms in Chicago, Atlanta, New York, New Orleans and San Francisco, found that New Yorkers were the least likely to wash their hands. (Eighty-three percent of Chicagoans, the cleanest group, scrubbed up.) Over all, 67 percent of women and 58 percent of the 7,836 people observed in the survey washed their hands.</p>
        <p>According to the study, hand washing is down significantly since the group's last study, in 1996, to 49 percent from 60 percent in New York alone. Among New York men, the decline is even more precipitous: 62 percent in 1996, but only 43 percent this year.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, outside the bathrooms on the dining concourse at Grand Central, few people were fessing up.</p>
        <p>Bob Breyer, 29, who works in advertising, said he washed his hands ''before and after.''</p>
        <p>''I actually use a tissue to open bathroom doors,'' he said. ''The therapist thinks it's funny.''</p>
        <p>Jose Arroyo, 50, a messenger, pointed at the puckered tips of his fingers. ''I do this 20 times a day,'' he said. ''A little piece of dirt on my hands, I have to wash them. I'm like Felix Unger -- you watch the 'Odd Couple'?''</p>
        <p>One man insisted that people from his home country, Spain, washed their hands more than Americans. Another said he carried hand sanitizer with him at all times.</p>
        <p>But John Hernandez, the custodial attendant, shook his head in disgust. ''The homeless people do clean because they have no place to wash,'' he said. ''The commuter doesn't wash his hands. Then they go out and get something to eat.''</p>
        <p>The study, conducted by observers over the course of one day in each location, offered no explanation for the decline in hand washing. But most bathroom users attributed it to life's frenzied pace.</p>
        <p>The figures are not scientifically rigorous, said Barbara Hyde, a spokeswoman for the society. ''They are an indication of how people behave.''</p>
        <p>She said the society hoped publicity on the study would further the objective of its national Clean Hands Campaign, which began after the 1996 study.</p>
        <p>In a separate telephone survey, the new study said, 95 percent of those asked said they always washed their hands after using public restrooms.</p>
        <p>Outside the bathroom at Grand Central, the ratio was about the same. A few people admitted steering clear of the sink.</p>
        <p>Eli Siemon, 26, an ice cream counter clerk, said he never washed his hands. ''Usually, I'll flush with my foot so I don't touch anything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And what of the women? While several were soaping away, one paused only long enough to give her hair a fluff. When asked why she did not wash, she hoisted a metallic evening purse and said, ''If I put this down on the sink, it would have gotten wet.'' Then she dashed away, refusing to give her name.</p>
