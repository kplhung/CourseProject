        <p>The House voted overwhelmingly tonight to commit 90 percent of next year's federal surplus to reduce the national debt and to make it harder to use Medicare or Social Security surpluses for tax cuts or other programs.</p>
        <p>The legislation was assembled by Republicans last week in an effort to choke off increased spending during forthcoming budget negotiations with the White House.

        <p>The House voted overwhelmingly tonight to commit 90 percent of next year's federal surplus to reduce the national debt and to make it harder to use Medicare or Social Security surpluses for tax cuts or other programs.</p>
        <p>The legislation was assembled by Republicans last week in an effort to choke off increased spending during forthcoming budget negotiations with the White House. It also lets Republicans embrace two popular campaign issues -- cutting the debt and protecting Social Security and Medicare -- while blunting Democratic criticism that they are the party of fiscal irresponsibility.</p>
        <p>After a brief debate on a day that many members were home campaigning, the bill passed, 381 to 3. Republicans were so confident about the measure that they packaged it into a series of votes that required a two-thirds majority. Easy Senate approval is expected.</p>
        <p>Democrats said the Republicans were trying to distance themselves from their own tax-cut plan. They said House Republicans were breaking with their presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, by trying to protect the Medicare surplus.</p>
        <p>The bill would require that the anticipated $198 billion surplus in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds be applied toward reducing the government's publicly held debt. It would also set up a separate account and transfer $42 billion of the surplus, outside of Social Security and Medicare, to help pay down the debt.</p>
