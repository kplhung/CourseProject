        <p>The explosion of knowledge about what role genetics plays in disease has altered the way medical care is being provided at the most basic levels, and many health professionals may not be up to the task.</p>
        <p>Researchers from the Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, writing in a recent issue of Genetics in Medicine, found that 70 percent of practitioners surveyed had discussed genetics with their clients. Yet fewer than 10 percent of those people surveyed -- including physical therapists, speech and hearing therapists and social workers -- were confident in their training in these issues.</p>
        <p>Indeed, perhaps they were right to be concerned: more than 80 percent said they had heard little or nothing about the Human Genome Project, the effort to map the human genetic code and one of the hottest medical stories in recent years.</p>
        <p>Dr. E. Virginia Lapham, the lead author of the study, said that as people learned more about genetics, they were raising the issue with doctors and nurses.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lapham said the study showed the need to expand genetic education programs for health professionals.</p>
