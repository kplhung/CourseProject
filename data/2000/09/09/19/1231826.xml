      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Senate will soon vote on a bill making it a federal crime to prescribe drugs to assist a patient's suicide. Any doctors convicted would serve a mandatory 20 years in prison. The House approved the bill, known as the Pain Relief Promotion Act, last year. President Clinton should veto the bill if the Senate passes it.</p>
        <p>The bill is an effort to outlaw physician-assisted suicide nationwide, thereby pre-empting an Oregon state law that allows such medical assistance. The bill's broader effect would be to discourage doctors from giving appropriate pain relief to terminally ill patients. Its language attempts to soften that impact by stating that alleviating pain through drugs is a legitimate medical purpose ''even if the use of such a substance may increase the risk of death.''</p>

        <p>The Senate will soon vote on a bill making it a federal crime to prescribe drugs to assist a patient's suicide. Any doctors convicted would serve a mandatory 20 years in prison. The House approved the bill, known as the Pain Relief Promotion Act, last year. President Clinton should veto the bill if the Senate passes it.</p>
        <p>The bill is an effort to outlaw physician-assisted suicide nationwide, thereby pre-empting an Oregon state law that allows such medical assistance. The bill's broader effect would be to discourage doctors from giving appropriate pain relief to terminally ill patients. Its language attempts to soften that impact by stating that alleviating pain through drugs is a legitimate medical purpose ''even if the use of such a substance may increase the risk of death.''</p>
        <p>This safe harbor is inadequate because the law gives federal drug enforcement agents new power to investigate whether there was ''intent'' to cause death. But intent is not easily determined when aggressive pain relief may hasten death and when dosage levels for an individual patient may well deviate from the norm to achieve relief. The likely result is that doctors will be discouraged from providing adequate dosages for fear that they will be targeted for investigation and prosecution.</p>
        <p>The bill is an inappropriate attempt to usurp the power of states to address the profound question of the right to die. Oregon voters have made the decision to allow physician-assisted suicide as a reflection of their needs and values. Oregon's Death With Dignity law allows a terminally ill patient to receive a lethal dose of drugs only if judged by two physicians to be of sound mind and to have less than six months to live. Other states may choose not to legalize assisted suicide. But Oregon voters should be allowed to act on this sensitive medical issue without Congressional interference.</p>
