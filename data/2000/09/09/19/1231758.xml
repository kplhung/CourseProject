        <p>The journey here from downtown Sydney is relatively long: about an hour in a car, about the same in a train, and a big change in mood and sophistication. But for the whitewater canoeists and kayakers who competed for medals here today, any commute is better than what they were facing two years ago: no Olympic journey at all.</p>
        <p>They are here because they wanted to be, not because they were asked to be. They are here because they lobbied hard and well, and because, in an unprecedented move, their own sport's federation decided to help pay for the construction of the Penrith Whitewater Stadium.</p>
        <p>''It is a good comeback story,'' said the French canoeist Franck Adisson, a gold medalist in 1996, as he stared down from a nearby ridge at the Olympic course and the 11,000 fans who were cheering in the sun.</p>
        <p>It is also a story that demonstrates the difficulty of cutting sports from the Olympics and to what lengths athletes will go to keep their window of opportunity open. Whitewater, in the minds of the organizers of the Sydney Games, initially meant white elephant, and after crunching the numbers, the Sydney organizing committee president, Michael Knight, and his advisers announced in November 1996 that whitewater canoeing and kayaking was not in their plans and not in these Games despite being part of the festivities in 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>''I remember going to the closing ceremony in Atlanta, and we had something on our hats that said, 'See you in Sydney,' '' the American canoeist David Hearn said. ''That was kind of when I decided right then that I wanted to go to another Olympics, and then a few months later, we heard we'd been cut out, and it was a big disappointment.''</p>
        <p>Whitewater had been cut before. It made its debut in 1972 at the Olympics in Munich because the West Germans liked the sport and were good at it. They spent several million dollars building an artificial river at Augsburg for the competition, but the East Germans managed to reconnoiter and copy the course at considerable expense and ended up winning all four gold medals.</p>
        <p>The sport did not reappear until 1992 in Barcelona, Spain, or more precisely in La Seu d'Urgell, which was closer to Andorra than to Barcelona. During the Atlanta Games, whitewater remained a fringe sport in both senses of the term as the events were contested in a different state: just across the border on the Ocoee River in Copperhill, Tenn.</p>
        <p>''It's never a sure thing,'' Hearn, a three-time Olympian, conceded.</p>
        <p>Building a whitewater site for the Summer Olympics is like building a bobsled run for the Winter Olympics: it is not done easily and usually not done cheaply. Knight reasoned that it was not worth the investment in a region with no tradition in this obscure sport and which had little reason to support such a site after the Olympics rolled on toward Athens.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the athletes had a different agenda. ''For a sport like ours to not be in the Olympics is condemning it to a slow death,'' said Adisson, who won a bronze medal in 1992 and the gold in 1996 in canoe slalom pairs with his partner Wilfrid Forgues.</p>
        <p>While the International Canoe Federation, more concerned with ''flatwater'' canoeing and kayaking, accepted the decision with relative equanimity, Forgues and Adisson were not prepared to let the sport slip back underwater. Instead they and other competitors shifted some of their attention from the rapids, boulders and narrow dangling gates that make their sport such an exacting test. Instead of pulling on their paddles, they pulled strings.</p>
        <p>Jacques Chirac, the president of France, made pleas to Olympic officials on their sport's behalf. The former German Prime Minister Helmut Kohl intervened, as well. Petitions were circulated (Hearn's wife, Jennifer, got Billie Jean King and the Olympic swimming star Janet Evans to sign) and alternative construction plans proposed after the city of Penrith -- the host to the rowing -- agreed to host the whitewater, as well, if Sydney organizers would agree.</p>
        <p>The result is what was on view today on a formerly bone-dry patch of land: a thoroughly artificial U-shaped, 320-meter course complete with six submersible water pumps and a conveyor belt to carry competitors from the finish to the start without their having to bother leaving their vessels. When it is not the site for Olympians, the new course is the host to suburban whitewater rafters, who pay for the thrill. The total price tag for one of the best and most unusually placed courses in the world: 6.5 million Australian dollars (about $3.54 million), or about half of what Sydney officials had originally projected when they decided to eliminate the sport.</p>
        <p>More than half of that money came from the New South Wales state government; the Penrith City Council and the International Canoe Federation and its national members financed the rest. For the first time, a sport has helped pay its own way into the Games and not without a certain cost to the athletes.</p>
        <p>''We didn't pay it out of our own pockets, but indirectly we did,'' said Hearn, a 41-year-old from Bethesda, Md., who finished 12th out of 12 finalists in today's canoe singles event won by Tony Estanguet of France. ''USA Canoeing and Kayaking gave 100,000 United States dollars. That's a lot of money for them, and it cuts into what they can do to help us.''</p>
        <p>The alternative is perhaps more costly: Adisson and Forgues lost their sponsorship deals after the sport was dropped from the Olympics. But conditions have since improved for the French team, which brought seven coaches to Penrith (the Americans brought one full-time coach). And today, the French won three of the six whitewater medals available. Estanguet won the men's event by taking advantage of a poor first run by the reigning Olympic champion Michal Martikan of Slovakia, who settled for silver. In the women's kayak singles, Stepanka Hilgertova of the Czech Republic defended her Olympic title, finishing well ahead of Brigitte Guibal and Anne-Lise Bardet of France.</p>
        <p>''All I know is that if President Chirac calls and congratulates us, no one can accuse him of hopping on the bandwagon,'' the French team leader Antoine Goetschy said.</p>
