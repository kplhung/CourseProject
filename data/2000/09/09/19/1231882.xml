        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The proposal that the ultimate meaning of the human genome will be fought out in the arenas of art and culture ignores the growing political battle and debate over the application of biotechnology to the food supply (''In Wake of Genetic Revolution, Questions About Its Meaning,'' Sept. 12).</p>
        <p>Critics allege that biotechnology is still experimental and should be restricted until it is better understood, and that it should at least be labeled.</p>
        <p>A recent survey suggests this political campaign may be having some effect. Genetic engineering was compared to other technologies. It was found to be viewed as similar to nuclear energy. Both are viewed with suspicion: about a third of the respondents felt that each technology would ''make things worse.''</p>
        <p>It appears that genetic engineering is still fraught with a great deal of public anxiety.</p>
        <p>DR. PAUL C. BERMANZOHN  New York</p>
