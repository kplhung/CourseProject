        <p>WHEN WE WERE ORPHANS  By Kazuo Ishiguro  336 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $25.</p>
        <p>Kazuo Ishiguro's disappointing new novel ''When We Were Orphans'' purports to be a detective story about a detective investigating his own past, and it boasts an action-packed narrative -- featuring a kidnapping, adultery, sexual enslavement, assorted murder investigations and lots of grisly wartime killings -- that would appear to stand in sharp contrast to the elliptical, ruminative work he's done in the past.</p>
        <p>But while ''Orphans'' gets off to a mesmerizing start, it soon devolves into an uneasy composite of his last two novels, costumed in the lurid clothes of thriller. Like ''The Remains of the Day'' (1989), it concerns a prim, emotionally repressed hero, whose account of his life is filled with rationalizations and illusions; and like ''The Unconsoled'' (1995), it recounts a strange, Kafkaesque journey that represents a voyage into the unconscious. Once again Mr. Ishiguro has given us an unreliable narrator suffering from delusions of grandeur and free-floating anxiety, a self-deluding protagonist who hides his insecurities behind a mask of professional detachment.</p>
        <p>Though ''Orphans'' has moments of enormous power, it lacks the virtuosic control of language and tone that made ''Remains of the Day'' such a tour de force, and it lacks the experimental ambitions of ''The Unconsoled.'' Indeed it remains a messy hybrid of a book that recycles Mr. Ishiguro's favorite narrative techniques while reprising his favorite themes -- most notably, his fascination with the ways in which people try to come to terms with the past, and their tendency to conflate the private and the political, the personal and the communal.</p>
        <p>Like the butler in ''Remains of the Day,'' the narrator of ''Orphans'' -- one Christopher Banks -- speaks to us in a precise, slightly detached voice that seems the very embodiment of English propriety and circumspection. He tells us that he grew up in Shanghai in the early years of the 20th century, that his parents -- first his father, then his mother -- mysteriously disappeared when he was 10 years old, and that he was sent to live with his aunt in England. His mother was apparently an outspoken opponent of the opium trade, a shady business that his father's British firm supported. The couple, it seems, were either abducted by gangsters involved in the drug trade or by business interests intent on silencing his mother's protests.</p>
        <p>The young Christopher and his best friend, a Japanese boy named Akira, used to play at being detectives, and as a grown-up, Christopher tells us, he has gone on to achieve renown in that very profession as a kind of latter-day Sherlock Holmes. Just as the detective story genre offers readers the consolations of an orderly narrative in which reason and logic will triumph, so detective work offers Christopher the illusion that he is using his acumen to restore order to the world around him. It is in this spirit that he decides, at long last, to return to Shanghai in the 1930's to solve the mystery of his parents' disappearance.</p>
        <p>It gradually becomes clear to the reader, however, that Christopher's story of his life is riddled with inconsistencies and perhaps outright distortions. Though he remembers himself as a plucky boy who was easily able to put the trauma of his parents' disappearance behind him, his former classmates remember him as ''an odd bird'' and ''miserable loner.'' His insistence that his devotion to his work has led him to renounce the blandishments of society are similarly contradicted by his frequent appearances at parties and black-tie dinners. At times the reader even wonders if he is really a detective at all, so cursory are his descriptions of his work. What real detective, we wonder, really solves cases with a magnifying glass?</p>
        <p>When Christopher's story shifts to Shanghai and his investigation into his parents' death, his account grows even more suspect. Like the pianist in ''The Unconsoled'' who believes that one of his concerts holds the seeds of renewal for an entire community, Christopher has come to believe that his ability to solve the mystery of his parents' disappearance somehow holds the key to containing the world's ''growing turmoil,'' from the Chinese-Japanese conflict to the escalating crisis in Europe.</p>
        <p>When a pretty socialite whom he has had a crush on for years suggests that they leave Shanghai and run away to Macao, Christopher replies: ''The difficulty is my work here. I'll have to finish here first. After all, the whole world's on the brink of catastrophe. What would people think of me if I abandoned them all at this stage?''</p>
        <p>As usual, Christopher is using his work as an excuse for his Jamesian reluctance to make an emotional commitment, but his inflated sense of his own importance in the worldwide fight against evil suggests that he is also suffering from severe delusions. In fact his account of his adventures in Shanghai grows increasingly hallucinatory and dreamlike. He comes to believe that after several decades his parents are still being held hostage in a local building, that he will succeed in rescuing them and that their reunion will be celebrated in a local park, just the way he used to imagine in the detective-story fantasies of his youth. He also comes to believe that an injured Japanese soldier he stumbles across in a battle zone is really his childhood friend Akira.</p>
        <p>In a contrived ending -- reminiscent of the stilted, explanatory ending of Hitchcock's ''Psycho'' -- Christopher and the reader are filled in on the truth of his parents' disappearance. ''I'm beginning to see now,'' he finally admits, that ''many things aren't as I supposed.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Ishiguro's description of Christopher's search for his parents through a war-ravaged neighborhood in Shanghai is a harrowing piece of writing, though his depiction of Christopher's long-ago childhood is similarly moving, such set pieces do not add up to a persuasive novel. Indeed the reader is left with the impression that instead of envisioning -- and rendering -- a coherent new novel, Mr. Ishiguro simply ran the notion of a detective story through the word processing program of his earlier novels, then patched together the output into the ragged, if occasionally brilliant, story we hold in our hands.</p>
