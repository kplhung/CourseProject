        <p>Some authorities think one reason college students engage in so-called binge drinking is that they believe it is more widespread than it really is.</p>
        <p>And so to combat the problem, some college officials have tried what they call the ''social norm'' approach: education campaigns telling students that abusive drinking is less common than they may believe.</p>
        <p>A new study suggests, however, that students have a very accurate idea about how often binge drinking takes place, and that they even tend to underestimate it a bit. The report, based on a survey of 14,138 students at 119 colleges, appears in the current issue of The Journal of American College Health.</p>
        <p>The students estimated that about 35 percent of undergraduates binge, close to the 44 percent rate that researchers have found nationally.</p>
        <p>Although the study casts doubt on the social-norm approach, its principal author, Dr. Henry Wechsler of the Harvard School of Public Health, said that did not mean enforcement was the only answer.</p>
        <p>''I would not want to see the academic environment become a place where revenuers search for stills,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But, he said, ''I don't think we ought to be so condescending about the 'ignorant college students' we're going to get to change their behavior by showing them the light.''</p>
