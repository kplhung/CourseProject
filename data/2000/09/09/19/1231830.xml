        <p>Editorial praises winning performances by New York sports teams, especially New York Giants and New York Jets; both teams have won 1st three games,</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>These are intoxicating times for New York sports fans. The city's two professional football teams have started the season with three straight victories. The Yankees seem assured of another division title. The Mets are causing the usual last-minute heartburn, but barring a collapse in two three-game matchups against the Atlanta Braves, they should at least capture a wild-card spot in the baseball playoffs. The city's professional soccer team, the Metrostars, a bust last year, has vaulted to the playoffs. Meanwhile, the regular hockey and basketball seasons are not yet under way, which means that it is too early to get depressed about the Knicks and the Rangers.</p>
        <p>The happiest surprises are the Giants and Jets.  Tiki Barber and the rookie Ron Dayne have rejuvenated the Giants' running game, while the defense has allowed only 41 points in three games. The Jets are an even better story. Last year their owner, Leon Hess, died. Their quarterback, Vinnie Testaverde, missed virtually the whole season with an injury. In the off-season their coach, Bill Parcells, quit, and his anointed successor, Bill Belichick, jumped to another team. A bona fide superstar, Keyshawn Johnson, was traded. But the Jets have responded nobly, winning their first two games with exciting fourth-quarter comebacks and the third with opportunistic big plays.</p>

        <p>Next week both teams will face marquee opponents. The Jets will play the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, another undefeated team, while the Giants confront the Washington Redskins, a club rich in high-priced free agents that has played unevenly so far. Should the Jets and Giants win these two games, New Yorkers may catch themselves dreaming of an all-New York Super Bowl.</p>
