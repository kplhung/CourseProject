        <p>Most government Web sites do not offer search capabilities, technical help or citizen services, like the ability to register a vehicle online, according to an analysis by researchers at Brown University. The study of 1,813 state and federal government Web sites concluded that government at all levels was not making full and effective use of commonly available information technology. Specifically, the survey found that 78 percent of the sites surveyed offered no online services, only 15 percent allowed some form of disability access and just 4 percent had foreign-language translation features. The survey, completed at Brown's Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions, found that the largest states had the most comprehensive presence online.</p>
