        <p>Dance Theater of Harlem retold three familiar tales in its program last Tuesday night at City Center.  The most compelling was John Taras's version of ''Firebird,'' for which he used Stravinsky's revised ''Firebird'' Suite of 1945 rather than the original, longer score of 1910. Yet all of the story is there. Transplanting the action from Russia to a lush tropical forest designed by Geoffrey Holder, Mr. Taras makes events move along excitingly.</p>
        <p>The dancing was as exciting as the choreography. Kellye A. Saunders as the Firebird made her arms and legs stab ceaselessly at the space around her. This bird was beautiful. But the incisiveness of Ms. Saunders's movements also revealed that she was fierce.</p>

        <p>Dance Theater of Harlem retold three familiar tales in its program last Tuesday night at City Center.  The most compelling was John Taras's version of ''Firebird,'' for which he used Stravinsky's revised ''Firebird'' Suite of 1945 rather than the original, longer score of 1910. Yet all of the story is there. Transplanting the action from Russia to a lush tropical forest designed by Geoffrey Holder, Mr. Taras makes events move along excitingly.</p>
        <p>The dancing was as exciting as the choreography. Kellye A. Saunders as the Firebird made her arms and legs stab ceaselessly at the space around her. This bird was beautiful. But the incisiveness of Ms. Saunders's movements also revealed that she was fierce.</p>
        <p>Portraying the Young Man who wanders into the enchanted forest, Duncan Cooper appeared appropriately wonderstruck by the good and evil magical powers he encountered. Leanne Codrington was sweet as the Princess of Unreal Beauty he finally marries, and Mark Burns was the menacing Prince of Evil.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooper became another likable hero when he partnered Bethania Gomes in Gabriella Taub-Darvash's staging of the Balcony Scene pas de deux from Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' The movements of both dancers remained fluid and lyrical throughout the duet. Arthur Mitchell, the company's artistic director, wisely encourages his dancers to stress the dramatic qualities of their roles. Yet Ms. Gomes should take care not to overemphasize Juliet's facial expressions, which sometimes looked forced. Fortunately, her body never did.</p>
        <p>Michael Smuin created his ''Medea'' to Samuel Barber's ''Medea'' Suite (Op. 23), which in 1946 accompanied ''Cave of the Heart,'' Martha Graham's work inspired by the Medea story. The choreographic approaches are totally different. Graham made the characters archetypal figures, but Mr. Smuin has introduced realistic touches into his mythical narrative. He turns the sons of Medea and Jason into two playful boys, appealingly danced by Kevin Thomas and Mr. Burns, and Donald Williams, as Jason, played games with them. Caroline Rocher made Creusa, Medea's rival, a silly flirt, and her murder by Medea and the boys was graphically depicted.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the story proceeds by choppy fits and starts. And Mr. Smuin never makes Medea the figure of towering rage he surely intended her to be. Lenore Pavlakos was certainly imposing in the role. But neither her interpretation nor Mr. Smuin's basic choreography made it seem believable that this woman would grow so enraged and demented as to kill her sons.</p>
        <p>Dwight Rhoden's ''Twist'' was the evening's one plotless piece. The title sums up its spirit. This is a ballet of whirls and wiggles and convoluted entwinings. ''Twist'' was filled with so many intricate nonstop squiggles that it sometimes became a strain to watch. Yet it provided the company with a real workout in its complex ensembles, its fidgety trio for Don Bellamy, Tanya Wideman and James Washington and in its duets, which featured Lynda Sing and Ramon Thielen; Ms. Rocher and Kip Sturm; Leslie Cardona and Mr. Burns; and Ms. Saunders and Mr. Williams as the couples in perpetual motion.</p>
        <p>''Twist'' had taped accompaniment by Antonio Carlos Scott. The other scores were conducted by Joseph E. Fields and David LaMarche.</p>
        <p>DANCE THEATER OF HARLEM REVIEWS  Correction:  October 9, 2000, Monday  A review on Sept. 19 about the Dance Theater of Harlem's performance of the Balcony Scene pas de deux from Prokofiev's ''Romeo and Juliet'' on Sept. 12 referred imprecisely to the role of Gabriella Taub-Darvash. She choreographed the dance; she did not stage it.</p>
