        <p>The high number of sport utility vehicles that have rolled over because of defective Firestone tires has splintered the auto industry's once-monolithic resistance to federal ratings of new models' tendency to roll over, increasing the odds that such ratings will be imposed.</p>
        <p>Regulators have been studying rollovers for 27 years, but industry lobbyists have appealed to members of Congress from auto-producing states to block periodic efforts to adopt rules that would address the problem. Rollovers kill 9,500 of the 41,000 Americans who die each year in crashes.</p>
        <p>Automakers, particularly those in Detroit, earn the bulk of their profits on sport utility vehicles and pickups, two classes of vehicles that have high rates of rollover deaths for their occupants and are likely to fare poorly in any safety evaluations that regulators might demand.</p>
        <p>When regulators announced a plan last May to begin providing consumers with ratings of the rollover tendencies of many models of cars, sport utilities, minivans and pickup trucks, the industry immediately persuaded the Senate to amend the regulator's budget, barring the calculation of the ratings and mandating another study of the issue instead.</p>
        <p>But with members of Congress now looking for ways to respond to the Firestone tire debacle, opposition to the ratings has been eroding even within the industry.</p>
        <p>Michael Stanton, the top lobbyist for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the industry's main lobbying group, said through a spokeswoman this afternoon that while the group still believed that the ratings were a bad idea, it was no longer lobbying to stop them. Mr. Stanton predicted that Congress would allow the ratings to be issued this autumn after all, although he added that Congress would still probably mandate another study of the problem.</p>
        <p>General Motors said this evening that it was nonetheless continuing its own lobbying against the ratings, which it described as poorly designed. But DaimlerChrysler said that it was conducting no lobbying against the ratings separate from the alliance, while Ford, which had most of the defective Firestone tires on its Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles, quietly dropped its opposition to the ratings last week.</p>
        <p>Members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are scheduled to meet as soon as Wednesday to iron out differences between the two chambers' transportation budgets. The House passed a transportation budget before the auto industry could mount a lobbying challenge to the rollover ratings plans, which were announced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on May 25.</p>
        <p>Senator Richard Shelby, the Alabama Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, has led efforts to stop the release of the ratings. His spokeswoman, Andrea Andrews, said that the ratings had not been adequately researched and that the senator remained opposed to them.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler, which makes its Mercedes M-class sport utilities in Alabama, said last month that it would build a second assembly line there to increase production. But Ms. Andrews said that Alabama's growing sport utility production had nothing to do with the senator's position.</p>
        <p>''It's not a state issue, it's a national issue,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Although most safety groups want the ratings adopted, a few share Senator Shelby's concerns that the process used to assess vehicles is so flawed that it should not be used. Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine and has been pushing for federal action on rollovers since 1988, testified against the ratings two weeks ago, saying that they were inadequate and calling instead for federal rules that would ban the sale of vehicles that are prone to tip over.</p>
        <p>The regulators' plan calls for using a stability index that compares the height of a vehicle's center of gravity to the track width between its tires. This method makes no allowance for sophisticated vehicle stability systems, just entering the market over the last several years, that automatically apply anti-lock brakes very briefly to a single tire when a vehicle appears close to tipping over. But regulators have defended their system as the best available.</p>
        <p>But there has been growing support for ratings among Republicans who do not have auto factories in their states or districts. Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is leading the House investigation, has been particularly outspoken.</p>
        <p>''Shelby ought to pull that blocker out and we should get ratings,'' Mr. Tauzin said in an interview last Thursday.</p>
        <p>Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination early this year, has used his position as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee to get the ratings released, too. He wrote a letter last week to the Senate Appropriations Committee, contending that the ratings were under his jurisdiction and should not be handled as a budget issue.</p>
        <p>Rollovers are the deadliest kind of crash, tending to kill or seriously injure people not wearing seat belts, while occupants wearing seat belts tend to fare much better.</p>
        <p>In a little-noticed comment last Tuesday before the Senate Commerce Committee, Jacques Nasser, Ford's chief executive and president, said that he did not oppose the release of the ratings. Ford Explorer sports utility vehicles with the defective Firestone tires have accounted for most of the 88 deaths in the United States now attributed to failures of the tires.</p>
        <p>The automaker has been fiercely criticized for not responding sooner to tire failures on Explorers overseas. Ford has been accused by many lawmakers, and to some extent by Firestone, of sharing responsibility for the deaths, although Ford officials strongly deny this.</p>
