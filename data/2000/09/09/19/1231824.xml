        <p>The first salvo in what may become known as the un-cola wars was fired yesterday when Cadbury Schweppes confirmed that it would buy Snapple, Mistic and other brands from the Triarc Companies.</p>
        <p>Cadbury will pay $910 million in cash and take on $420 million in debt from the publicly held Triarc. It also will pay about $120 million for options held by Snapple employees after the sale is completed. The deal puts Coca-Cola and PepsiCo in the unusual position of being perceived as falling behind in the fast-growing noncarbonated beverage category. While soft drinks like cola have been posting little to no growth over the last several years, sales of bottled water, fruit drinks and noncarbonated alternatives have been growing at double-digit rates.</p>
        <p>Both Coke and Pepsi have said they expect much of their growth in the coming years to come from noncarbonated drinks rather than their flagship brands. But neither has made the kind of bold move into the category that Cadbury has, although Coke is negotiating to buy at least part of the South Beach Beverage Company, which owns the Sobe brands.</p>
        <p>''This deal is a real coup for Cadbury strategically in terms of its overall U.S. market position,'' said John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. Once the deal is completed later this fall, Cadbury will have a 13.8 percent share of the noncarbonated beverage market, according to Beverage Digest/Maxwell, which tracks sales volume. Coke will have 25.5 percent; Pepsi, 16 percent; and Quaker Oats, which owns the Gatorade brand, will have 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Analysts predicted yesterday that the two giants would spend heavily to gain market share from Cadbury, historically the weaker third player in the intensely competitive United States beverage business.</p>
        <p>''This kicks up the pressure on Coke and Pepsi to aggressively go after the segment,'' said Bill Pecoriello, a beverage analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company. Another analyst, Caroline Levy of UBS Warburg, said: ''It puts Coke and Pepsi at a disadvantage, particularly Coke, which has been struggling to find its way domestically. Cadbury goes from being a not-often-thought-about No. 3 to a real competitor.''</p>
        <p>In agreeing to buy all of Triarc's beverage brands, Cadbury will also own Royal Crown Cola, which has a 2 percent market share, mainly in the South. But that also means Cadbury for the first time will have a cola that competes with Coke and Pepsi, making it a competitor on that level with companies it relies on to bottle Dr Pepper, 7Up and other brands it already owns. And because RC also produces private-label soft drinks, Cadbury will be seen by some Pepsi and Coke bottlers as a competitor in that sense as well.</p>
        <p>Cadbury's chief operating officer, John Brock, called RC ''an important brand for a number of independent bottlers.'' Asked if he planned to sell it, he said, ''Any plans to sell or dispose of anything would be something we'd talk about at a later date.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brock said the decision to buy the Triarc brands reflected the company's strategy, although some industry experts thought Cadbury was backing away from the beverage business last year when it sold its brands in much of the world to Coca-Cola for $1.3 billion.</p>
        <p>At the time, Cadbury executives said they saw great opportunity in the confectionery business, where there has been far less consolidation than in soft drinks. Since 1995, when Cadbury completed its takeover of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Company, the United States soft-drink market has been the single biggest business unit at the candy and beverage company, which is based in London.</p>
        <p>''We've never said we weren't interested in expanding our drinks business,'' Mr. Brock said. ''We've kept our eyes open for the right kinds of value-enhancing deals, like our purchase of Hawaiian Punch and the formation of the Dr Pepper-Seven Up Bottling Group. We see this as a larger continuation of the strategy we've been following for the last several years.''</p>
        <p>Peter W. May, Triarc's president and chief operating officer, called the price ''excellent,'' while analysts generally said Cadbury had paid a lot. Mr. May said Cadbury first expressed interest in making the acquisition several months ago but offered a price that did not appeal to him or Nelson Peltz, Triarc's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>In June, Mr. Peltz and Mr. May announced plans to spin off the Snapple, Mistic, Stewart's root beer and Royal Crown brands as a publicly traded company. The offering had been scheduled for later this month, until Cadbury made its latest bid.</p>
        <p>Triarc's return on its investment is remarkable: in May 1997, it paid $300 million to acquire Snapple from Quaker, which had spent $1.7 billion to buy it three years earlier. Triarc had hoped to raise $85 million to $100 million by taking the Snapple group public.</p>
        <p>Since then, the Snapple management team, led by Michael Weinstein, has won plaudits from the industry for turning Snapple into a leading brand again. Mr. Weinstein brought back Wendy the Snapple Lady, the loud-mouthed spokeswoman who had been relieved of her duties during the Quaker years; introduced products, like Whipper Snapple and a line called Elements, intended to compete with Sobe; and invested in new advertising and marketing programs.</p>
        <p>Even so, some analysts worried that Cadbury's takeover could mean another rocky period for Snapple and the other brands.</p>
        <p>''They paid an awful pretty penny for this business,'' said Skip Carpenter, a beverage analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ''It's a very expensive multiple for a lot of execution risk. It took them three years to get Dr Pepper right, and it's going to take them a couple of years to get this right.''</p>
