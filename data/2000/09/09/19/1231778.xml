        <p>The Toronto International Film Festival seemed determined this year to remind us that the word international was an integral part of its title. And the best of the features from other countries didn't offer the idea of one world, but rather created specific worlds that grew out of the cultures from which they came.</p>
        <p>The rousing ''Calle 54,'' the Spanish director Fernando Trueba's documentary on Latin jazz, is so good it could have been shown every day. Even hardened moviegoers burst into applause after each of the numbers, and Mr. Trueba lavishes a kind of loving care in his filming of performances that has never been seen in a movie on jazz. The performances by the film's Latin jazz masters -- including Paquito D'Rivera, Gato Barbieri (a perfect note for the festival, since he was close to iconic European directors like Jean-Luc Godard, Bernardo Bertolucci and Roberto Rossellini and muses about their gifts in ''Calle 54''), Michel Camino and the always spectacular Tito Puente, in what was probably his last film appearance -- are more than worthy of such attention.</p>

        <p>The Toronto International Film Festival seemed determined this year to remind us that the word international was an integral part of its title. And the best of the features from other countries didn't offer the idea of one world, but rather created specific worlds that grew out of the cultures from which they came.</p>
        <p>The rousing ''Calle 54,'' the Spanish director Fernando Trueba's documentary on Latin jazz, is so good it could have been shown every day. Even hardened moviegoers burst into applause after each of the numbers, and Mr. Trueba lavishes a kind of loving care in his filming of performances that has never been seen in a movie on jazz. The performances by the film's Latin jazz masters -- including Paquito D'Rivera, Gato Barbieri (a perfect note for the festival, since he was close to iconic European directors like Jean-Luc Godard, Bernardo Bertolucci and Roberto Rossellini and muses about their gifts in ''Calle 54''), Michel Camino and the always spectacular Tito Puente, in what was probably his last film appearance -- are more than worthy of such attention.</p>
        <p>The picture glistens with musical and moviemaking talent, as it shifts from jagged hand-held mini-profiles of the players to sumptuously staged segments in which each of them performs. I can only imagine that the happy crowd, laughing and chattering away about the beauty and fire of the playing, rushed out and bought as many CDs by the film's artists as they could find. (Someone missed a bet by not selling the soundtrack in the lobby.)</p>
        <p>Raoul Peck's ''Lumumba,'' a biography of the slain African political figure Patrice Lumumba, is demanding and complicated as its title figure. Mr. Peck crams his film with a breathtaking amount of information, rolling through history swiftly and boldly yet conveying an epic investment in characterization as Lumumba's power and comrades inexorably fade, victims of the conflict in the Congo. Mr. Peck makes the startling choice of having a saddened Lumumba narrate his story after his death, but it pays off: Mr. Peck reveals dramatic layers to show his protagonist's posthumous gift of second sight and allows us to follow his growth in confidence and finally exhaustion. One hopes that it gets a United States release, if only so that the contained fury of Eric Ebouaney as the picture's hero -- a turn that ranks with the sinewy complication of Denzel Washington's workout as Malcolm X -- can be seen by American audiences.</p>
        <p>The Australian film ''Chopper'' is a bio-pic of a different sort, tracking the folk hero Mark (Chopper) Read. As played by Eric Bana he's the world's most charismatic baby, a man who follows his impulses to a horrifying degree. Sybaritic and charming, Mr. Bana is loose-limbed and witty -- James Cagney as a side of beef -- so much so that the director Andrew Dominik's handling of the grim proceedings, which comes so dangerously close to glamorizing Chopper's bent for violence that the film feels like a backyard fable, given Mr. Bana's open-faced likability.</p>
        <p>There was other rough-hewn allure in the festival, too, as seen in Paul Pawlikowski's ''Last Resort,'' a love story filmed on the run and on the cheap. Mr. Pawlikowski shows finesse in controlling this comedy, as Tanya (Dina Korzun) tries to flee Russia and join her boyfriend in London. The plan falls apart when he abandons her and her young son to internment in a British designated holding area, as they await a decision on a last-ditch effort to seek political asylum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pawlikowski crams in a lot of detail, and scenes that could have been awash in bathos become more fully rounded because of the director's understatement; Tanya takes a job as an Internet siren and bursts into tears while peeling off her costume before the Web camera; her shame makes her a hit. There's nothing new in ''Resort,'' except the smoothness of the storytelling, and the actors, Ms. Korzun and Paddy Considine -- whose cheerful swagger could make him the guy most Maxim readers want to be -- emerge as stars in this extremely limited exercise, a movie that feels almost like a meditation on inertia.</p>
        <p>Further deepening the international flavor were Guy Deslauriers's harrowing ''Passage du Milieu,'' which follows the trail of misery involved in transporting slaves from Africa to the New World; the mesmerizing and angry Iranian film ''The Circle,'' which examines the oppression experienced by women there; or Michael Haneke's unusual look at racism in France, ''Code Inconnu.'' There was so much worthwhile cinema from other countries that the Hong Kong action director Tsui Hark's ''Time and Tide'' was relegated to Midnight Madness status. And in this instance Mr. Hark shows some signs of growing up; this could have been his expansion into territory occupied by his fellow countryman Wong Kar Wei (whose blissful ''In the Mood for Love'' was also in the festival, playing to larger notice), that is until he became tired of adult concerns and allusive filmmaking and it finally turned back into a Tsui Hark movie. It's still a pile of fun.</p>
        <p>The homegrown aspect of the festival could be found in the Preludes, 10 short films by Canadian filmmakers commissioned to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the event, which has evolved from the Festival of Festivals into the less-desperate-for-legitimacy-sounding current title. Most of the shorts, by directors like Michael Snow, Atom Egoyan, Patricia Rozema and the actor-director Don McKellar, deal with the festival. One of them, ''Congratulations,'' by Mike Jones, tried to ridicule the hackneyed and fuzzy-headed tributes by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in which has-beens whose own memories about their achievements have dimmed are trotted before a camera. But the film suffered from a modesty similar to the originals. The most generous audiences in the filmgoing world took to booing ''Congratulations,'' which is tantamount to having a mother admit that her child is ugly.</p>
        <p>One of the best of the preludes was among those that didn't touch on the festival at all. Guy Maddin's smashing ''Heart of the World'' is a tribute to the power of the silent film. It has a lunatic sweep and zest, with two brothers, one a mortician and the other an actor playing Christ in a Passion play, vying for the hand of a woman who bats her eyes enough to raise the theater's BTU levels while the beating and literal Heart of the World is in danger of stopping, all scored by the rousing ''Time, Forward.'' Mr. Maddin gives a goofy notion of the enthusiasm of a manifesto, and audiences responded to his funny and fervent short, in which the hoariest of cliches are zapped with his belief in the power of the medium. It's the kind of thing festivals should be about, and it was definitely worth waiting 25 years to see.</p>
