        <p>The night was calm and 70 degrees, nothing like October, and at the outset, offered no indication of the drama about to brew in the Bronx. The Yankees were anxiously peering past the game toward the postseason.</p>
        <p>But soon the night started to tingle, electricity sparking off the right fingers of the Cleveland Indians' starter Bartolo Colon, who reached triple digits on the radar gun, slicing off corners of the plate and carrying with him the determination of a team fixated on the finish line of the wild-card race.</p>
        <p>For the first 24 Yankee batters, the 25-year-old native of the Dominican Republic mystified the home team as well as the quiet crowd of 31,317 in Yankee Stadium, challenging history when they were not looking. But Luis Polonia was.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' second batter in the eighth inning and the only Yankee hitter not to strike out in frustration to that point, figured a fastball was coming again from Colon. And when it torpedoed in at 94 miles an hour right down the middle Polonia shot the ball up the middle and preserved the team's 42-year streak without being no-hit, the longest in baseball, now at 6,637 games.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately,'' Polonia said later, ''I was the only one.''</p>
        <p>His hit saved the Yankees from dissolving a record that has lasted since 1958, but it was small consolation last night, however, as New York mustered only the one hit and lost, 2-0, in a pitchers' duel that matched the teams' fire-throwing aces.</p>
        <p>Colon (14-8) struck out the side to end the game with a fitting flourish, totaling a season-high 13 strikeouts. Roger Clemens (13-7) lost for the first first time since June 9, despite striking out nine batters, giving up six hits and walking five through seven innings.</p>
        <p>In only his third full year with the Indians, Colon recorded his first one-hitter, and his first complete game of the year. He struck out the side in the sixth inning as well as the ninth, and as the possibility of his no-hitter developed, the Indians were mum on the bench, not wanting to jinx his control with their nervous voices.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, meanwhile, were deep in thought, trying to figure a way to get to him. They had two good chances all night.</p>
        <p>In the eighth, after designated hitter Glenallen Hill struck out, Polonia, who had hit a ball sharply to first baseman Jim Thome in the fifth inning, wanted to keep it simple.</p>
        <p>''He had been throwing fastballs all night,'' Polonia said. ''I just wanted to be patient and make contact.''</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre of the Yankees was not the only one to sigh in relief when he did. There have only been six no-hitters against the Yankees, the last one coming Sept. 20, 1958, by the Baltimore knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm.</p>
        <p>''You don't like to lose that way, that would have been embarrassing,'' Torre said. ''You've got to make a guy earn it. I'm just happy it got through.''</p>
        <p>Torre, though, was not pleased with the result of this series in which the Indians won three of four, and stayed a half-game ahead in the wild-card race. The Indians outscored the Yankees, 31-11, winning by two blowouts and a shutout.</p>
        <p>''They're a good team and they were a lot more focused than we were,'' Jorge Posada said. ''We're not focused right now. We've got to find a way to win games and clinch and have some fun. Right now, we're not having fun.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees' magic number still stands at eight. If the Yankees clinch and the Indians win a wild-card berth, they would come back to face the Yankees in the division series with a rotation of Colon, Dave Burba and Chuck Finley.</p>
        <p>Torre knows this. ''Colon was unhittable,'' he said. ''If this guy goes out and pitches like he did tonight, sure I'm worried.''</p>
        <p>Clemens regained his control after a shaky first three innings in which he allowed five walks, more than he had given up in nine games. Posada said the ball was slipping out of his hands, and because of that, Clemens gave up a run in the first inning, when Manny Ramirez drove in his eighth run of the series, singling in Kenny Lofton who had walked.</p>
        <p>Clemens gave up another run in the third inning when Ramirez walked, Jim Thome doubled and then Ramirez came home on a passed ball.</p>
        <p>''The ball was just jumping out of my hands,'' Clemens said. ''But I calmed down. I knew I had to keep their hitters at bay. It was only two runs, we had a chance to come back.''</p>
        <p>Except that Colon was not yielding. He threw as fast a 100, but routinely hit 97 on the radar gun and mixed his pitches. On his 114th and final pitch, he got Derek Jeter to flail at a slider that dropped mercilessly to the ground.</p>
        <p>''He basically dominated from the beginning,'' said Jeter, whose 41-game streak of reaching base ended.</p>
        <p>Colon, immersed in his own zone, did not realize what he was doing. '' ''Once I got into the eighth inning, I became more conscious of it and I concentrated more, he said.''</p>
        <p>Polonia made sure Colon's name would not be in the record books.</p>
        <p>''Once you get five or six innings of no-hit ball, the adrenaline kicks in,'' Clemens said. ''He stayed in control and he was still strong at the end.''</p>
        <p>Were it not for the hit, Colon might have had a perfect game. In the first inning, Russell Branyan, the left fielder converted from infield, misplayed David Justice's towering fly ball for a two-base error.</p>
        <p>In the second inning, Lofton, stole a certain home run from Posada by springing onto the center field wall and intercepting the hurtling ball mid-flight.</p>
        <p>In the seventh inning, Thome saved the no-hitter by flying to his right on instinct and extending his glove to meet a hard-hit chopper ball by Tino Martinez. Thome flipped easily to Colon for the out.</p>
        <p>The Yankee batters spent much of their time in the box staring at the plate in amazement and shaking their heads, often upset with umpire Tim Tschida's wide strike zone. ''You can't take away from Colon,'' Torre said. ''He was terrific tonight, better than the umpire but you're not going to diminish what Colon did.''</p>
