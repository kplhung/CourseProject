        <p>Let's get crazy for a moment and imagine that the two presidential candidates are actually going to devote one of their debates to foreign policy -- what would they talk about?

Would Mr. Bush ask Mr. Gore to give viewers his insights on Buddhist temples? Nah. Doubt it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore could, though, ask the Republican candidate to explain how is it that Mr. Bush's foreign policy advisers say the U.S. shouldn't be the world's global cop or 911, fighting wars around the world, while Mr. Bush's vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, says U.S. troops are woefully underfunded and underprepared. Put it together and the Bush position is that the U.S. military should be better prepared to do nothing and better funded to go nowhere.</p>

        <p>Let's get crazy for a moment and imagine that the two presidential candidates are actually going to devote one of their debates to foreign policy -- what would they talk about? Would Al Gore, Rick Lazio-like, thrust upon George W. Bush a map of the world with the country names spelled out phonetically (RUSH-ah, ee-ROCK, Grease)? Would Mr. Bush ask Mr. Gore to give viewers his insights on Buddhist temples? Nah. Doubt it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore could, though, ask the Republican candidate to explain how is it that Mr. Bush's foreign policy advisers say the U.S. shouldn't be the world's global cop or 911, fighting wars around the world, while Mr. Bush's vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, says U.S. troops are woefully underfunded and underprepared. Put it together and the Bush position is that the U.S. military should be better prepared to do nothing and better funded to go nowhere.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore could also ask Mr. Bush why, if the Republicans are so serious about foreign policy, they allowed both the Senate and House foreign affairs committees to be run by Republican lawmakers, such as Jesse Helms, who had so little clue about the world that these two once-great committees have become more irrelevant than anytime in their histories.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, for his part, could press Mr. Gore to elaborate on his call for more ''forward engagement'' in U.S. foreign policy, to quell crises before they erupt. For instance, Mr. Bush could ask Mr. Gore for a single example of where the Clinton team successfully forward-engaged. The Asian economic crisis? Haiti? Kosovo? Russia? Cuba? Iraq? Other than in North Korea, where the Clinton team deserves credit for defusing a very dangerous situation, this would be a short list.</p>
        <p>But this forward engagement concept actually would be a good place to start a debate. Where would each candidate be working right now to defuse a crisis that could require costly U.S. intervention, and what tools would he use? Right answer: The most likely places for U.S. intervention in the next four years are five islands: Cuba, Taiwan, Indonesia, North Korea and Iraq -- the latter two being islands unto themselves.</p>
        <p>On Cuba, eventually Fidel Castro is going to pass away, and when he does there will be enormous pressure from Miami Cubans to intervene in Havana when a power struggle breaks out there. Now is the time to be preparing a soft landing for Cuba. Regarding Taiwan, China's Jiang Zemin is expected to step down at the next party congress in 2001 and he will not want to leave office without having at least resumed the dialogue with Taiwan, or be seen to have taken some decisive, unilateral action to press unification. Because a war between China and Taiwan threatens so many U.S. interests, the next president should consider secret U.S. mediation between the two as soon as he's sworn in.</p>
        <p>North Korea is a small basket case, whose hard-headed regime is also desperately in need of a soft landing, which the Clinton team has been working on, and Indonesia is a large basket case, whose soft-headed regime may be incapable of keeping Indonesia from splitting apart. Indonesia is a long way from Washington, but if the world's fourth-largest country, which sits astride the key shipping lanes of Southeast Asia, comes unglued, America will get drawn in.</p>
        <p>Finally, U.S. fighter planes are in action over Iraq every day. It will take just one U.S. plane to be shot down inside Iraq for the next president to have his foreign policy agenda immediately dominated by what to do about Saddam Hussein. (Actually, we're already Saddam's hostages. With today's oil market so tight, if he takes just a few barrels off the market, gasoline could go to $3 a gallon.)</p>
        <p>As for new tools, one place the next president could start is by revamping U.S. foreign aid, by both greatly expanding the foreign aid budget, so that America is no longer the world's cheapskate, and by making all U.S. non-military assistance or debt relief conditional. The condition would be that the recipient country put in place basic anti-corruption, rule-of-law measures and institutions that will attract private investors, who have replaced governments as the key source of capital for growth in the world. Aid or investment will not work in countries without institutions.</p>
        <p>As I said, just some crazy thoughts. No doubt the presidential candidates can, and will, get by without discussing any of them. The next president won't be so lucky.</p>
