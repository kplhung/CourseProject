        <p>Re ''Games Open With Ceremony and Tribute'' (front page, Sept. 16):</p>
        <p>In the context of another Olympics (resplendent with national uniforms, anthems and flags, and with predictions about how many medals that countries will win), here are some radical ideas: House athletes in enclaves devoted to the event in which they will compete, giving them a chance to communicate with people from many countries with whom they share much in common.</p>
        <p>Organize the march into the stadium according to sport, so that swimmers march with swimmers, pole vaulters with pole vaulters, and rowers with rowers. Finally, gold, silver and bronze medal winners from each event could stand on the podium, arm in arm, saluting the Olympic flag (and the ideal of international understanding that it might again represent).</p>
