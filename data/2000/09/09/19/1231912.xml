        <p>Net2Phone is branching out beyond its core business of providing low-cost voice and data calls over the Internet in forming a software venture with Cisco Systems. The new company, called Adir Technologies, will sell software to communications companies seeking to route calling traffic over the Internet. With the venture, in which Cisco has a minority stake, Net2Phone hopes to receive revenue from software licensing fees. The diversification of Net2Phone's activities is an effort to make the company, which is based in Newark, less vulnerable to the fierce competition gripping the Internet telephony industry.</p>
