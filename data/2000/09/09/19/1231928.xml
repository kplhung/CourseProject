        <p>A team that had been invincible and a streak that had seemed unbreakable both hit a wall today as the United States softball team lost to Japan, 2-1, in a tense duel that played out over 11 innings in the Olympic Softball Stadium in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>The loss ended the United States' consecutive-game winning streak at 112 games, a string of victories that included international competition and a 60-game tour leading up to the Olympics. Its last previous loss came in the 1998 world championships. The Americans, the defending gold medalists, are 2-1 here this week, following victories over Canada and Cuba. Japan is 3-0.</p>

        <p>A team that had been invincible and a streak that had seemed unbreakable both hit a wall today as the United States softball team lost to Japan, 2-1, in a tense duel that played out over 11 innings in the Olympic Softball Stadium in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>The loss ended the United States' consecutive-game winning streak at 112 games, a string of victories that included international competition and a 60-game tour leading up to the Olympics. Its last previous loss came in the 1998 world championships. The Americans, the defending gold medalists, are 2-1 here this week, following victories over Canada and Cuba. Japan is 3-0.</p>
        <p>The game was scoreless for 10 innings before Japan scored its runs in the top of the 11th, aided by two errors by Dot Richardson. Under Olympic rules, after nine innings, each team starts the inning with a runner on second. In the 11th, Japan moved its free base runner to third on a groundout. Haruka Saito hit a grounder to Richardson at second; Richardson, one of the stars of the 1996 Games, bobbled the ball and threw wildly to first, allowing the runner to score. Later in the inning, she misplayed a throw to second on a steal attempt. The ball rolled into center field and another runner scored for a 2-0 Japan lead.</p>
        <p>In the bottom of the 11th, Lisa Fernandez started on second for the United States, moved to third on Crystal Bustis' single to left and scored on a hit by Sheila Douty. With Bustis on third, the Japanese pitcher Juri Takayama struck out Jennifer Brundage and Stacey Nuveman to end the game and the streak.</p>
        <p>Michelle Smith took the loss, despite five and two-thirds innings of relief in which she struck out eight and allowed just two hits and the two unearned runs. The Americans stranded 20 runners and squandered bases-loaded situations in the seventh, eighth and ninth innings.</p>
