        <p>BERRY-William F. The board of directors and officers of United Rentals, Inc. announce with great sadness that William F. Berry, president and a director, has died following a courageous battle with cancer. He was 48 years old and had been on medical leave since February 1999. He spent more than 30 years in the equipment rental industry including as president, director and chief executive officer of U.S. Rentals, Inc. before its merger with United Rentals in September 1998. Our industry has lost an outstanding business leader as well as an individual with tremendous honesty and integrity. Bill always kept his eye on the human side of the business, and his contributions to the success of United Rentals were immeasurable. He was an outstanding role model for people in the industry and understood that a business can succeed only when its employees are treated with respect and dignity. We will miss him deeply, and on behalf of all of our employees, extend our profound sympathies to his wife, Susan, and their children, Scott, Ann and David. United Rentals, Inc.</p>
