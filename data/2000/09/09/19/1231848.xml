        <p>A California developer and philanthropist plans to donate $80 million to modernize the National Museum of American History, the largest single donation ever to the Smithsonian Institution, officials said today.</p>
        <p>The gift by Kenneth E. Behring, a billionaire home-builder, will allow the museum to provide new exhibits on important themes of America's heritage, including the American presidency, politics and military history, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''This guy is doing something that's wonderful for a great American institution,'' said Lawrence M. Small, the Smithsonian secretary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Behring's contribution comes three years after he donated $20 million to the National Museum of Natural History. His combined $100 million donation exceeds the largest gift to date to the Smithsonian: $60 million by Steven F. Udvar Hazy to the National Air and Space Museum last year. Before that, the largest single donation was $12 million.</p>
        <p>In recognition, the Smithsonian plans to inscribe a plaque designating the museum's main hall on the Washington Mall as the Behring Center, Mr. Small said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Behring, who is 72, said he hoped his donation would steer the museum to highlight the contributions individuals had made to freedom and national prosperity.</p>
        <p>''When people come out, they'll have a better understanding of what America is, who we are as a people,''  Mr. Behring said. ''It's people that have made our country great.''</p>
        <p>The museum has already assigned $4 million of the $80 million to pay for a new exhibit, ''The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden,'' which officials say will be the most comprehensive look at the nature of the nation's top job. That exhibit is scheduled to open in November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Behring's gift to the National Museum of Natural History was briefly controversial. In addition to the money, Mr. Behring gave the Smithsonian four bighorn sheep he had shot in the Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. Since the sheep were on lists of threatened species, conservationists said the Smithsonian should not accept such trophies. Mr. Behring said the museum ultimately accepted both his money and the stuffed sheep.</p>
