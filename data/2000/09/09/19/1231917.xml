        <p>The Dallas Cowboys did not wait until the actual game to beat up on the Washington Redskins, the best team money thus far cannot buy. While both teams were headed to the locker room after pregame warm-ups, a group of Cowboys shoved several Redskins, and a full-fledged scrum broke out. There was pushing, the grabbing of face masks, and other naughty acts.</p>
        <p>For the first time this season, maybe in several years, the Cowboys put up a fight, and that healthy nastiness continued once the contest actually started. There is no way this game, which Dallas won, 27-21, tonight at FedEx Field, should have been close. The Redskins have a roster full of Pro Bowlers while the Cowboys have aging has-beens.</p>

        <p>The Dallas Cowboys did not wait until the actual game to beat up on the Washington Redskins, the best team money thus far cannot buy. While both teams were headed to the locker room after pregame warm-ups, a group of Cowboys shoved several Redskins, and a full-fledged scrum broke out. There was pushing, the grabbing of face masks, and other naughty acts.</p>
        <p>For the first time this season, maybe in several years, the Cowboys put up a fight, and that healthy nastiness continued once the contest actually started. There is no way this game, which Dallas won, 27-21, tonight at FedEx Field, should have been close. The Redskins have a roster full of Pro Bowlers while the Cowboys have aging has-beens.</p>
        <p>Yet the castoff quarterback Randall Cunningham, subbing for the concussion-plagued Troy Aikman, outplayed his younger counterpart, Brad Johnson, who was intercepted once and fumbled once. Emmitt Smith, who has more mileage than a classic sports car, was the workhorse Redskins runner Stephen Davis was not for much of the game. Deion Sanders, the multimillion-dollar showboat, muffed a punt that hit him in the facemask. And a mediocre Dallas defense punished Washington's offensive line while the highly paid Redskins defense played like a bargain-basement one.</p>
        <p>None of this includes silly unsportsmanlike conduct penalties by the Redskins for shoving Dallas players after the play was dead, especially the one by Andy Heck, who gave a cheap shot to a Cowboy in the fourth quarter on the Washington sideline. Heck wasn't even in the game.</p>
        <p>Dallas led by 17-7 in the third quarter and suddenly, with a pale-faced Daniel Snyder looking on from his owner's box, stunned, the Redskins took advantage of a Cunningham interception when Davis later scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. That cut Dallas's lead to 3 points in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Then Cunningham's mobility, as it had done most of the night, hurt the Redskins again. On one third down play, he rolled right, and threw left, connecting with wide receiver Raghib Ismail for 44 yards to the Washington 31. Two plays later, on another Cunningham rollout, he hit tight end Jackie Harris for a 16-yard touchdown. Dallas led, 24-14, with 9 minutes 19 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Washington closed the gap to 24-21 after a 7-yard touchdown catch by fullback Mike Sellers with 5:34 left. But Johnson was intercepted with just over two minutes left by safety Izelle Reese. The Cowboys added a late 38-yard field goal.</p>
        <p>The Cowboys (1-2) beat Washington (1-2) for the sixth consecutive time, and in the process, possibly saved their season. While the Redskins, touted as Super Bowl favorites, will have a week of explaining as to why a team loaded with talent has won just one game. Coach Norv Turner will also hear calls, possibly from Snyder, for the backup Jeff George.</p>
        <p>This game was a must-win for both teams. The Cowboys needed it for any realistic hope to salvage their season. Dallas still has some champions on its roster, like Aikman, Smith, safety Darren Woodson, and Leon Lett, but it would be difficult for any organization to make a comeback from an 0-3 start.</p>
        <p>Washington did not waste time setting the tone, thanks to two gutsy calls by Turner, a former Dallas offensive coordinator. On Washington's second possession Sanders, on a punt return, faked left, then handed the ball off on a reverse to Champ Bailey, who ran 56 yards to the Dallas 32. Then when the Redskins faced a fourth-and-1 at the Dallas 6, Turner went for it, and the gamble paid off when Davis scored.</p>
        <p>But Dallas, like the rumble in the tunnel before the game, showed they were not going to be intimidated. After stopping Washington on its third series, Cunningham picked up a fumbled snap, then threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to running back Chris Warren, who was lined up wide as a receiver, and beat strong safety Sam Shade to tie the score at 7-7.</p>
        <p>Dallas Coach Dave Campo in the second quarter then made his own bold play call. The Cowboys, like the Redskins, faced a fourth down and a yard, only Dallas was at the Washington 3-yard line. Cunningham made a beautiful college-style pitch left to Smith for the touchdown.</p>
        <p>It was the first time this year that Washington's defense allowed a red-zone touchdown.</p>
        <p>Incredibly, the old, ragged Cowboys, huge underdogs, led by 14-7 at halftime, and fans, irritated by Turner's conservative play-calling, and Johnson's erratic throwing, booed loudly.</p>
        <p>It wasn't all Johnson's fault because he was getting little protection from his offensive line. He was feeling pressure most of the night -- as was the entire Washington team. And that is something the Redskins had better get used to.</p>
