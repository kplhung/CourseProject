        <p>There was no fanfare, no No. 11 stitched onto his back. Mark Messier was wearing no number at all.</p>
        <p>But when he skated onto the Madison Square Garden ice at noon yesterday as a member of the Rangers for the first time in more than three years, Messier did not need a number to announce his presence. He needed no introduction at all.</p>
        <p>The thousand or so fans who had come to see an open practice rose as one and treated Messier to something he has grown accustomed to hearing at the Garden over the years: a standing ovation.</p>
        <p>''It was great,'' said Messier, who  demonstrated his thanks with a wave and a smile to the crowd. ''It was nice for those folks to be able to come in and see a practice. A lot of people don't ever get the opportunity to see a game.''</p>
        <p>Only 18,200 people -- the Garden's seating capacity for hockey -- will have the chance to see Messier in person when he dons his white No. 11 sweater for the first time since 1997 for the Rangers' home opener Oct. 11 against the Montreal Canadiens. It promises to be one of the hardest tickets of the year.</p>
        <p>Until then, Messier will play only in the Rangers' preseason road games and, of course, in their season opener Oct. 7 in Atlanta. The Rangers want to make Messier's official return to the Garden a special one. That means that Messier will not be in the lineup tonight, when the Rangers are host to the Philadelphia Flyers in an exhibition.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was the first time Messier had been in the Rangers' dressing room since he left the team in a fractious parting from Neil Smith, then general manager and team president. Messier has often called the six years he spent in New York during his first tenure the best time of his life. ''But it's not like I'm sitting here reminiscing,'' Messier said. ''There is a tremendous amount of work here that needs to be done. It's like when I came to New York the first time. Whatever happened in Edmonton was in the past. We've got to work at getting this turned around. You can sit and think about what happened in the past, or you can start thinking about the future.''</p>
        <p>It might be easier this time. Messier will not have to deal with any chants of ''1940.'' All those were extinguished when he led the Rangers to the Stanley Cup in 1994. But Messier will have to deal with a franchise that has dropped to its lowest depths in three decades, one that has not qualified for the postseason in three seasons, all while Messier was in Vancouver.</p>
        <p>There are plenty of questions surrounding Messier as well. He will turn 40 in January, near the midpoint of the season, his 22nd in the National Hockey League. Like the Rangers, Messier has sat out the last three postseasons. ''I don't think the fans are going to be too hard on Mark,'' Coach Ron Low said.</p>
        <p>It is possible that Messier's advancing age might be held against him by some this season if the Rangers' struggles continue. But Messier said he did not fear failure.</p>
        <p>''I was considered old when I came here in 1991,'' Messier said. ''I have to face the reality to a degree. I wish I was still 22. But I still feel that I can contribute and play well. What's most important to me is finding a way for us to win on any given night.''</p>
