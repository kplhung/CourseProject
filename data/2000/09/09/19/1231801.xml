        <p>Marks &amp; Spencer P.L.C., once the unchallenged flagship of British Main Street retailing, ousted its chief executive and other longtime managers today, pursuing its quest for an elusive formula to reverse declining sales and a plunging stock price.</p>
        <p>The departure of Peter Salsbury, the 51-year-old chief executive who held the job for only 21 months, was the latest sign that the company, which once relied on a reputation for solid midprice quality, was finding it difficult to recover ground seized by snappier upstarts like Next P.L.C. and Hennes &amp; Mauritz of Sweden with a keener eye for an increasingly youthful clothing market.</p>
        <p>''The market is moving on very fast,'' said Tony Shiret, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. ''It's reasonable to try something new to arrest the decline in what's become a very dynamic market.''</p>
        <p>Luc Vandevelde, a Belgian citizen who joined the company as chairman in January from the French grocery chain Promodes, said he would take over as chief executive until a replacement was hired.</p>
        <p>He also appointed Roger Holmes, 40, to lead Marks &amp; Spencer's British retailing division -- its core business, with 297 stores. Mr. Holmes resigned last week from the British five-and-dime chain Kingfisher P.L.C., where he had been an executive director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vandevelde also announced the departure of Clara Freeman, the head of the British stores, and Guy McCracken, the head of international retailing, both 25-year employees. The moves effectively end the tradition of drawing top managers from among the longest-serving employees.</p>
        <p>The changes mean that neither of the company's top two managers have direct experience in selling clothing. But Mr. Vandevelde said the company had ''plenty of clothing talent'' at other levels.</p>
        <p>Marks &amp; Spencer, which owns the Brooks Brothers chain in the United States, has been floundering since late 1998 when profits began to fall, starting a decline that has continued despite huge spending on new stores and marketing.</p>
        <p>Marks &amp; Spencer shares, which have lost 40 percent of their value over the last year, rose 1 percent today to close at 212.25 pence, or about $2.99.</p>
