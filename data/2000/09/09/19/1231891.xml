        <p>New York City has fountains by the hundreds. Some are modern, and some antiquated; some have water that gushes, while others spray and sprinkle. But however hot the afternoon, however tempting the sight of the cool, flowing water, do not even think of getting wet, as touching the water is forbidden at nearly every fountain in the city.</p>
        <p>But this coming weekend, a new fountain is opening, one that people are actually invited to play in. It will open at the American Museum of Natural History on the Upper West Side as part of the Arthur Ross Terrace. The terrace, a public space that spans one acre and includes strolling areas and tree-shaded dining tables overlooking the fountain, is on the museum's north side, by West 81st Street and Columbus Avenue.</p>

        <p>New York City has fountains by the hundreds. Some are modern, and some antiquated; some have water that gushes, while others spray and sprinkle. But however hot the afternoon, however tempting the sight of the cool, flowing water, do not even think of getting wet, as touching the water is forbidden at nearly every fountain in the city.</p>
        <p>But this coming weekend, a new fountain is opening, one that people are actually invited to play in. It will open at the American Museum of Natural History on the Upper West Side as part of the Arthur Ross Terrace. The terrace, a public space that spans one acre and includes strolling areas and tree-shaded dining tables overlooking the fountain, is on the museum's north side, by West 81st Street and Columbus Avenue.</p>
        <p>The fountain, as the centerpiece of the terrace, is flat and very shallow and inlaid with lights and tiny mirrors. Its bottom is granite, and its designs inspired by the moon and the stars.</p>
        <p>In a contemplative mood, a visitor could trace the blue, green and purple lights and see the shape of the brightest stars in the constellation Orion, the hunter. The mirrors, 212 in all, mimic the positions of the constellation's dimmer stars.</p>
        <p>But it is the accessibility of the fountain that sets it apart. Children are welcome to walk through it, to roll in its gently flowing watery carpet. They can jump through the four gushing water jets and dump buckets of water on one another's heads. Adults, too, can cool off by wading barefoot or even lying down and letting water flow around them.</p>
        <p>The Ross Terrace is multi-tiered, edged with rectangular panels of boxwood bushes, ginkgo trees and patios with tables and hardwood benches. It is situated by the Frederick Phineas &amp; Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space, which opened earlier this year. At night, the sheer carpet of water glows with the reflection of the huge titanium sphere enclosed in the Hayden Planetarium's glass walls, which are bathed in blue light.</p>
        <p>Kathryn Gustafson, a New York City architect, said the designs on the stone floors of the terrace and fountains were inspired by photographs of lunar eclipses. Wedge shapes made of dark gray and nearly black granite are meant to evoke the conical shadows cast during an eclipse. The wedges are created by granite in shades of gray ranging from pale to nearly black.</p>
        <p>There are subtle reminders of the solar system elsewhere in the terrace, said Anne Canty, a museum spokeswoman, including many so subtle they will elude most visitors unless specifically pointed out. The ginkgo trees, for instance, are the only surviving species of a family originating some 300 million years ago. The shape of their leaves is intended to recall prehistoric fossilized leaves, and their bright yellow color in the fall, to resemble the sun's rays.</p>
        <p>Young pagoda trees line the stairs and plaza. When grown, they are intended to shade sets of hardwood benches, where groups of visitors and school children can gather.</p>
        <p>Like the Theodore Roosevelt Park on West 81st Street, also part of the museum, the fountain and dining spaces are open to the public for relaxing and strolling.</p>
