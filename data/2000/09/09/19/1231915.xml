        <p>The former chief of Chile's secret police, convicted of masterminding a lethal car bombing here in 1976, was an informer for the Central Intelligence Agency when the bombing occurred, a year after he had received a one-time payment for his cooperation, newly released documents show.</p>
        <p>The official, Gen. Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, former head of DINA, the secret police, under the 17-year military dictatorship in Chile, was enlisted by the C.I.A. beginning in 1974, a year after Gen. Augusto Pinochet led a coup that toppled the elected government of President Salvador Allende Gossens, the documents show.</p>
        <p>The American spy agency maintained its contacts with General Contreras until 1977, a year after General Contreras and his deputy, Brig. Gen. Pedro Espinoza Bravo, organized the attack on Embassy Row in Washington, according to the documents released today by the agency in a declassified report to Congress.</p>
        <p>The bombing killed Orlando Letelier, Mr. Allende's former ambassador to the United States, and a 25-year-old American associate, Ronni Moffitt.</p>
        <p>The spy agency's relationship with General Contreras continued although ''almost immediately after the assassination, rumors began circulating that the Chilean government was responsible,'' and ''at that time, Contreras's possible role in the Letelier assassination became an issue,'' the report says. It also says the C.I.A. later received ''specific detailed intelligence reporting concerning Contreras's involvement in ordering the Letelier assassination'' but does not make clear when that information was obtained.</p>
        <p>In 1993 in Chile, Generals Contreras and Espinoza were sentenced to seven and six years, respectively, in prison for the crime, one of the worst cases of foreign-sponsored terrorism on American soil.</p>
        <p>''During a period between 1974 and 1977, C.I.A. maintained contact with Manuel Contreras Sepulveda, who later became notorious for his involvement in human rights abuses,'' said the intelligence agency report.</p>
        <p>The relationship with General Contreras was viewed as ''necessary to accomplish the C.I.A.'s mission, in spite of concerns that this relationship might lay the C.I.A. open to charges of aiding internal political repression,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Although the C.I.A. said it had warned General Contreras that it would not support any of his repressive activities, it ultimately issued a one-time payment to him, even after it had found that ''Contreras was the principal obstacle to a reasonable human rights policy'' in the military government.</p>
        <p>The payment, an unspecified amount in 1975, was made in error, the report said, after leaders of the C.I.A. had overruled their agents' recommendations to establish a paid relationship with General Contreras, ''citing the U.S. government policy on clandestine relations with the head of an intelligence service notorious for human rights abuses.''</p>
        <p>Peter Kornbluh, a senior analyst at the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental clearinghouse for declassified documents, said the report sheds light on the contacts with forces that toppled a democratic government and killed thousands of people. ''This is in fact the unraveling of a cover-up of U.S. ties to repression during the Pinochet dictatorship,'' Mr. Kornbluh said. ''This is the first step toward a candid disclosure of the truth about that dark era.''</p>
        <p>Central Intelligence Agency officials could not be reached for comment late this evening.</p>
        <p>The spy agency acknowledged in the report that its behavior in Chile would not meet more rigorous standards in place today.</p>
        <p>''As a result of lessons learned in Chile, Central America and elsewhere, the C.I.A. now carefully reviews all contacts for potential involvement in human rights abuses and makes a deliberate decision balancing the nature and severity of the human rights abuse against the potential intelligence value of continuing the relationship,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>''These standards, established in the mid-1990's, would likely have altered the amount of contact we had with perpetrators of human rights violators in Chile had they been in effect at that time,'' it said.</p>
        <p>In a similar case in Guatemala in 1996, the CIA acknowledged that it had maintained a paid relationship with Col. Julio Roberto Alpirez, during a time in which it concluded that the Guatemalan officer had been involved in covering up the 1990 murder of an American citizen, Michael DeVine, and Efrain Bamaca, a captured Guatemalan guerrilla.</p>
        <p>The C.I.A. report on Chile, which was required by legislation written by Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, a New York Democrat, said the spy agency was ''not involved in facilitating Pinochet's accession to president nor the consolidation of his power as Supreme Leader.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hinchey, after studying the report, reached a different conclusion. ''The C.I.A. funneled millions of dollars to strengthen opposition political parties working against the Allende government,'' he said. ''That can cover a multitude of sins.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinchey called the relationship with General Contreras a mistake. ''It just shows the zeal with which the C.I.A. operators at that time proceeded,'' he said. ''They made league with some very vicious people.''</p>
