        <p>John Copley's production of ''Le Nozze di Figaro'' is one of the oldest stagings in the New York City Opera's active repertory; indeed, the company has seen three artistic administrations come and go (a fourth is in place) in the quarter-century since this version of Almaviva's castle was first erected on the stage of the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>But apart from a general feeling among frequent operagoers that standard works should be periodically restaged -- by no means a trifling force in the workings of the opera world -- there is little reason to replace it.</p>
        <p>Its concept is so straightforward as to be invisible in these self-consciously high-concept times. It is an 18th-century ''Figaro,'' set at a castle near Seville, with neither updating nor border crossing. And its sets and costumes, by Carl Toms, are traditional and soft-hued. When the production returned to the repertory on Saturday evening, it seemed both familiarly homey and fresh, as if it had been touched up and streamlined.</p>
        <p>In one way, it had been. Although Albert Sherman remains the stage director and the principal singers have been heard in their roles before, the chemistry of the cast inevitably affects the performance, particularly in a work so dependent on ensemble work, both vocally and dramatically. Rigorously tight ensemble has always been a hallmark of this production, and it remains so, sometimes almost to a fault. There were moments when the cast moved together so efficiently and so like a well-oiled machine that one craved a spark of nonchoreographed freshness.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, those sparks were forthcoming. One new twist in the production is the degree to which it emphasizes the work's comedic moments, or at least, spreads them evenly through the cast. Dr. Bartolo and Marcellina, often played broadly in the first two acts, are toned down but by no means stripped of their ridiculousness in the portrayals by Kevin Glavin and Gwendolyn Jones.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Dean Ely's Figaro takes an extra pratfall here and there, and both he and Sari Gruber, as Susanna, use the grand gestures of silent film melodrama in the last act duet in which Susanna impersonates the Countess while the Count looks on.</p>
        <p>The audience was more than charmed by these touches. In place of the subdued, slightly self-conscious laughter one typically hears at the opera, the audience responded to the cast's sight gags with the more unbuttoned laughter of the movie theater. But there was a tradeoff. Amid all the frivolity, the moments of emotional depth -- Susanna's ''Deh, vieni, non tardar,'' for example, and the moment of the Countess's return at the end of the work -- were muted and set slightly at a distance.</p>
        <p>Still, this is a ''Figaro'' that offers many pleasures. Ms. Gruber brought a sweet timbre and an ear for nuance to her portrayal of Susanna, and Mr. Ely, who possesses a strong, appealing bass-baritone, matched Ms. Gruber's agility and timing. Paula Rasmussen's mezzo-soprano had an unusual, slightly steely timbre, but she was a lively Cherubino. The bright timbre of Pamela Armstrong's soprano made for a youthful Countess who seemed more irked than forlorn. And John Hancock was a superb foil as the Count.</p>
        <p>The singers in the smaller roles also made strong contributions, among them Don Yule as Antonio, Mr. Glavin and Ms. Jones as Dr. Bartolo and Marcellina, and Heather Buck, who made her house debut with a charmingly naive and nicely sung portrayal of Barbarina. Steuart Bedford conducted a comfortably brisk performance, and the orchestra played well for him.</p>
