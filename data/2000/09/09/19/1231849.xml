        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG</p>
        <p>THE PACE PICKS UP  With the presidential campaign in the homestretch, the pace is picking up and the Bush and Gore camps are both portraying themselves as going all-out, leaving not a town bypassed, a hand unshaken, a baby unkissed or a local delicacy untried. According to each camp's calculations, here's how yesterday went:</p>
        <p>Length of the Official Day: Bush, 11 1/2 hours; Gore, 15 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>States Visited: Bush 3; Gore 2</p>
        <p>Towns and Cities Visited: Bush 3; Gore 2</p>
        <p>Events: Bush 4; Gore 4</p>
        <p>Press Conferences/Interviews: Bush 1; Gore 0</p>
        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>BACK TO HEALTH CARE  At the start of a week that Democrats had said would be devoted to the broad issue of helping working families, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman abruptly shifted gears yesterday and focused instead on health care, an issue the Democrats have found works to their favor but one that Gov. George W. Bush homed in on hard over the weekend. Speaking in Albuquerque, Mr. Lieberman responded to Mr. Bush's charge that Democrats advocate big-government health care solutions by asserting that government does, in fact, have a role to play. Mocking Mr. Bush's health care record in Texas, Mr. Lieberman said: ''He says that we should leave no child behind. But in Texas he has left behind more than one million children who need health insurance. That's Governor Bush's real record, what that real record has meant to real people, real children.'' Then, defending the Democratic approach to health care, Mr. Lieberman said: ''Government can't and shouldn't do everything for everybody. But when it comes to a vital need such as health care, unless government stands up for people, millions of Americans will not have a real choice.''</p>

        <p>TEAMSTERS CHEER GORE  To the cheers of 1,500 Teamsters, Vice President Al Gore bounded into a Las Vegas ballroom yesterday to formally accept the endorsement of the Teamsters union. James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president, declared that the union's 1.5 million members and 500,000 retirees were ''ready to join the fight.'' The union had withheld its endorsement last year when most of the rest of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsed Mr. Gore, but conferred its blessing on Sept. 7. In thanking the members meeting here today, Mr. Gore spoke on behalf of raising the minimum wage and against ''all the union-busting that's going on.''</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>CAMPAIGN SPENDING CRITICISM  Senator John McCain of Arizona, whose advocacy of overhauling campaign financing helped fuel his Republican presidential run, is backing a ballot measure that would cap political donations in California. At a weekend Republican convention in Palm Springs, he said fund-raising in the state was ''out of control'' and cited the record-breaking collection pace of California's governor, Gray Davis, a Democrat. Mr. Davis has raised $21 million for a re-election run in 2002. Statewide campaigns in California can easily cost more than $15 million, but Mr. McCain argued in endorsing the measure, Proposition 34, that the pace at which Mr. Davis was raising money was ''most egregious.'' The convention endorsed the proposition. Mr. Davis, through his office, said campaigns were so expensive that candidates must aggressively raise money.</p>
