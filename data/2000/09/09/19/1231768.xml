        <p>If the United States women's softball team is looking for a marketing label, they can credibly lay claim to ''The Invincibles.''</p>
        <p>The United States beat Cuba, 3-0, today thanks to three home runs, one by Sheila Douty and two by Crystl Bustos. The victory extended the Americans' winning streak to 112, the last loss being to Australia, 1-0, in 10 innings, in the 1998 world championship game in Japan.</p>
        <p>The 15-woman United States squad, including 10 players (or alternates) from the Olympic victory at Atlanta in 1996, started five of its gold medalists against Cuba today in a bid to maintain the momentum of its 6-0 victory over Canada in Sunday's opening round.</p>
        <p>The eight-nation competition has a schedule of 28 preliminary games, with finals listed for Sept. 29-31.</p>
        <p>The host nation's team, for whom the memory of that snatched victory over the United States two years ago is an Olympic inspiration, markets itself as ''Aussie Thunder.''</p>
        <p>But the Australians made a quiet start Sunday, edging lowly New Zealand, 3-2, on a home run after three extra innings. Despite this, Australia is still rated the only team here with a chance to stop the apparently invincible Americans.</p>
        <p>The United States-Cuba game was played in 80-degree temperatures before only 1,000 spectators.</p>
        <p>Bustos, who said she recently trimmed 20 pounds off her now 185-pound frame, has hit three home runs in two games here.</p>
        <p>''It was awesome,'' she said.</p>
        <p>WEIGHT LIFTING  Mexican Wins in Dispute</p>
        <p>Soraya Jimenez pulled off a huge upset, winning the 127 1/2-kilogram Olympic women's weight lifting gold medal for Mexico on her final lift. But not without considerable drama and controversy.</p>
        <p>Ri Song Hui, the prohibitive favorite from North Korea, was leading when the clock inexplicably ran out before she could make the second of her three lifts in the clean and jerk.</p>
        <p>The missed lift, which the North Koreans said resulted from a marshal improperly blocking her way to the podium, gave Jimenez a chance to overtake Ri with her third and final lift.</p>
        <p>North Korea's protest was disallowed by the International Weight Lifting Federation, whose officials left the arena without commenting, as did Ri.</p>
        <p>''We were robbed of a gold medal,'' said Chang Ung, who heads the North Korean Olympic delegation.</p>
        <p>Ri appeared devastated on the medals stand, but she congratulated Jimenez and held her hand during the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Mexico had never won an Olympic weight lifting medal.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Yang Xia of China won at 116 1/2 pounds. Yang either tied or set world records with four of her five lifts.</p>
        <p>Also in the sport, the International Weight Lifting Federation lifted a ban placed on four Romanian lifters.</p>
        <p>The four Romanian team members had been expelled from the Olympics on Sunday because three of their teammates failed drug tests. However, the Romanian team appealed and was given the option to pay a $50,000 fine to have its four weight lifters -- three men and one woman -- reinstated. (AP)</p>
        <p>VOLLEYBALL  American Women Go 2-0</p>
        <p>Two days after overpowering China in four games, the American women's team took only 55 minutes to dispatch Kenya, 25-16, 25-6, 25-16. The Americans must win one more match to assure themselves a spot in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>In beach volleyball, the Americans Misty May and Holly McPeak, the fourth-seeded team in the Olympic women's competition, won their first match by crushing the Czechs Martina Hudcova and Tereza Tobiasova, 15-5.</p>
        <p>The other American women's team, Jenny Johnson Jordan and Annett Davis, also won its first match to reach the final 16. (AP)</p>
        <p>CYCLING  Dutchwoman Prevails</p>
        <p>In the women's 3,000-meter individual pursuit, Leontien Zijlaard of the Netherlands finished in 3 minutes 33.360 seconds to win the gold medal. She beat Marion Clignet of France, who was timed in 3:38.751.</p>
        <p>Zijlaard rode to a world record in Sunday's semifinals, breaking a four-year-old mark set by Clignet.</p>
        <p>Zijlaard, the 1990 world pursuit champion, returned to cycling only in 1998 after a two-year struggle with anorexia.</p>
        <p>The German team of Guido Faust, Olaf Pollack, Daniel Becke and Jens Lehmann set an Olympic record of 4:01.735 in the team pursuit quarterfinals. It was the seventh Olympic record, along with one world record, in cycling's first three days. (AP)</p>
        <p>SHOOTING  Lithuanian Triumphs</p>
        <p>Daina Gudzineviciute of Lithuania won the gold medal in women's trap shooting, which made its Olympic debut. Gudzineviciute had a score of 93, a point better than Delphine Racinet of France. (AP)</p>
        <p>FENCING  Italy Repeats in Epee</p>
        <p>Italy defended the team epee title it won in Atlanta by defeating perennial powerhouse France in the gold-medal match, 39-38.</p>
        <p>Italy entered the final round trailing, 38-36, but Alfredo Rota beat Hugues Obry by 3-0 to win the gold.</p>
        <p>The other members of the Italian team are Maurizio Randazzo and Paolo Milanoli. (AP)</p>
