        <p>Two distressing facts about the nation's youth bode ill for their future well-being: American children today are fatter than ever and less fit than they were in the 1960's, when John F. Kennedy established the President's Council on Physical Fitness. The fitness bug that bit many adults has not carried over to the younger generation.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons for this sad state of affairs. As school budgets tighten, physical education classes are often curtailed or abandoned. One in four children gets no physical education in school, and Illinois is the only state that requires daily phys-ed for all children, kindergarten through high school. In most school districts, the idea of a sound mind in a sound body has been abandoned, despite evidence that physically active children tend to do better in school.</p>
        <p>Competition for children's time and attention has greatly intensified. The average child from age 6 to 11 watches 25 hours of television a week, and studies have shown that the more time spent in front of the box, the less fit and the fatter the child is likely to be. Now computers and video games are keeping more and more youngsters on their duffs when they are not in school.</p>
        <p>And, in many more families than ever before, both parents work outside the home. Many children spend the afternoon indoors at an after-school center or with a baby sitter who is reluctant to take them out to play. And to keep latchkey children safe, they are often told to stay indoors after school until a parent gets home, which is usually too late to allow for outdoor activities.</p>
        <p>Finally, the rush to the suburbs by young families can be counterproductive to raising fitter children, who often have to be driven somewhere to take part in an organized activity. The lack of sidewalks in many suburbs precludes safe walking even to a friend's house nearby.</p>
        <p>Now, with the Summer 2000 Olympics in full swing and scooters a national rage, it is a good time to take a hard look at the declining physical state of American youngsters and to devise ways of reversing this trend. The idea, though, is not to focus on training elite athletes who may someday became champions. Only a small percentage of children are talented enough to make school teams or win competitions. The idea is to foster fitness in all children according to their interests and abilities.</p>
        <p>Benefits of Being Fit</p>
        <p>Regular physical activity enhances thinking ability and reaction time, reduces stress, increases stamina and strength and helps to control weight. Physical activity also fosters self-esteem, self-confidence and a more positive body image. And, by allowing children to ''let off steam'' in a healthful way, it can make for a more peaceful household and better parent-child interactions.</p>
        <p>Physically active children are healthier. They tend to have fewer coronary risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol or excess weight.</p>
        <p>They have stronger bones and a reduced risk of later developing diabetes or cancer of the breast or colon. And, perhaps because active youngsters care more about how well their bodies perform, they are more likely to eat healthfully and are less likely to smoke, drink or take drugs.</p>
        <p>Inactive children tend to grow up to be inactive adults. Thus, the best time to foster enjoyment of physical activity is in childhood, when lifelong habits are more likely to develop. That means getting children involved in aerobic activities they can pursue into adulthood, like walking, running, bicycling, swimming, tennis and skating.</p>
        <p>The goal for elementary schoolchildren, according to organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, should be a total of 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity each day, and preferably more; participation in a variety of activities that work different parts of the body, and at least one period of 10 or 15 minutes a day of vigorous exercise that gets the heart to beat faster.</p>
        <p>The responsibility for children's well-being starts with their parents, who should set good examples and make physical activity a priority, on a par with schoolwork and chores. The rule in our house when our sons were young was, If it's light out, you're out. After being cooped up in school for five or more hours, children need to run around. We are lucky enough to live on a city street with a wide sidewalk, where children can play ball, skate and run around safely.</p>
        <p>We are also a block from a large park with a bike path, skating rink, walking-running path, ball fields and tennis courts. But even without such nearby amenities, it is possible, and important, to provide safe havens for physical activity for all children.</p>
        <p>A Plan of Action for Schools</p>
        <p>Let's start with the schools. After-school sports should not be only for elite athletes. Intramural activities should be available to any interested child, regardless of athletic prowess. In many communities, the local school has facilities for after-school activities, but the school closes at 3 p.m. Too often, parents' associations fail to object when schools eliminate active programs.</p>
        <p>One approach for budget-squeezed schools might be to get businesses or corporations to pay for activities like walkathons, bike-athons or dance-athons or to sponsor activities like aerobics on land and in water, racket sports or skating lessons. Or after-school activities could be supervised by volunteer parents or high school or college students who were responsible and adept at the activity.</p>
        <p>Other options are after-school programs at Y.M.C.A.'s or community centers. A parent may have to help a child find activities that are both fun and rewarding. Parents should also be sure that a child always uses appropriate protective equipment, especially a helmet when riding a bicycle, scooter, skateboard or skates. Wrist supports and knee pads are also good, as are mouth guards for football and face guards for hockey. And remind children to stretch to reduce the risk of injuring muscles and joints.</p>
        <p>Children are more likely to pursue physical activities if a parent participates with them. Find something you both enjoy, like hiking, bicycle riding, swimming or ice skating. But do not push children into an activities they do not enjoy or have difficulty accomplishing. The emphasis should always be on participation, not performance or winning a game. If a child's chosen activity is something you cannot do, find ways to show your support. And be sure to be physically active yourself, letting your children know that lifetime exercise is important.</p>
        <p>Also, encourage physical activity as part of the routines of life by having children walk instead of ride, take stairs instead of elevators or help out with gardening, shoveling snow, vacuuming or other active household chores. Finally, try to make family vacations active ones or stay at resorts where child-appropriate activities are available.</p>
