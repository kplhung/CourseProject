        <p>Three years ago, Jack Weisberg, a sound engineer who had worked for 25 years designing sound systems for theaters, stadiums, studios and even boats, walked into a shell of a building at 173 Franklin Street in TriBeCa and had a vision. The four-story structure, once a firehouse, had been abandoned for years. The roof was patchy and leaking. There was no plumbing or heating system. It was a wreck.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Weisberg thought it could be turned into a performance space for electronic music, a space constructed in such a way that it could be adapted to various sound installations. After renovations that cost $1.4 million and lasted three years, that space, which Mr. Weisberg calls Engine 27 in homage to its former purpose, is complete. Described as a sound gallery, Engine 27 opened on Friday night with a free wine-and-bread reception, and an installation of an electronic work by John Cage, ''Bird Cage.''</p>

        <p>Three years ago, Jack Weisberg, a sound engineer who had worked for 25 years designing sound systems for theaters, stadiums, studios and even boats, walked into a shell of a building at 173 Franklin Street in TriBeCa and had a vision. The four-story structure, once a firehouse, had been abandoned for years. The roof was patchy and leaking. There was no plumbing or heating system. It was a wreck.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Weisberg thought it could be turned into a performance space for electronic music, a space constructed in such a way that it could be adapted to various sound installations. After renovations that cost $1.4 million and lasted three years, that space, which Mr. Weisberg calls Engine 27 in homage to its former purpose, is complete. Described as a sound gallery, Engine 27 opened on Friday night with a free wine-and-bread reception, and an installation of an electronic work by John Cage, ''Bird Cage.''</p>
        <p>The gallery on the ground floor is now a handsome, long rectangular space with red brick walls and a carpeted floor. The walls are dotted with sound-absorption panels that look like large gray wood-framed pillows. Hanging from the iron rigging in the ceiling, which is also covered with sound-absorption materials, are some dozen large black-box speakers that Mr. Weisberg designed and built. An elevator takes visitors up to the second-floor workshop, where Mr. Weisberg's maintains his studio and the offices of Engine 27, which is to become a nonprofit organization for the performance and exploration of electronic music. The top two floors have been converted into Mr. Weisberg's living space.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to just continue to be a manufacturer of sound equipment,'' Mr. Weisberg, 65, said during the opening. ''I wanted to advance the state of the art, to provide a space where composers could expand their ideas of what is possible.''</p>
        <p>As technological innovations increasingly affect the way sound is produced, it's only logical that innovations should affect the places where sound is experienced. Affiliations between Engine 27 and electronic music departments at various universities are under discussion, Mr. Weisberg said. In the next few months works and installations by Larry Austin, Earle Brown, Darren Copeland, Hildegard Westerkamp and other composers will be presented in the gallery.</p>
        <p>Cage composed ''Bird Cage'' in 1970 and '71, working with Joel Chadabe, the founder and president of the Electronic Music Foundation and a co-sponsor of the Engine 27 project. Cage's original work consisted of 12 half-hour tapes with  three tracts of recorded sounds: the chirping of birds in aviaries, the electronically treated sounds of Cage reading words from Thoreau's ''Walden,'' and a final tract of ambient street noise. In ''performing'' the piece, Cage operated a control panel to select from the various tapes at random.</p>
        <p>For this occasion Mr. Chadabe has prepared a ''spatialized, new realization'' of the work for a digital age, he said, in which a computer software program continually, and randomly, selects from the recorded materials. A complete presentation lasts four hours. But visitors are invited to come and go at will, something Cage, no doubt, would have approved of.</p>
        <p>In this version ''Bird Cage'' seemed a sound collage of moaning, rumbling, whistles, crackles, intoned vaguely audible words, all presented against a background of quiet chirping. Of course, on Friday night the constant buzz of conversation became another element of the piece.</p>
        <p>Not everyone was bothered, especially one entranced visitor, Matthew Thompson, a young photographer from Brooklyn. Though quite accustomed to art galleries, Mr. Thompson was fascinated by the idea of a sound gallery. ''It's a beautiful concept,'' he said. ''You become attuned to the space, the music and to what people are saying. I'm coming back.''</p>
        <p>When he does, during visiting hours from noon to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays, it should be a lot quieter, just the ongoing music of ''Bird Cage,'' and scant conversation.</p>
