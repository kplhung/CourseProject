        <p>Michael Strahan did not intend to sound in awe of the Washington Redskins. None of the Giants appeared to be today. Strahan's glowing review of Washington's roster was conditional and echoed what is being discussed around the National Football League.</p>
        <p>''They definitely have more talent than anybody,'' he said before the Redskins fell to the Cowboys tonight, 27-21. ''To be able to get the free agents they have on top of the draft picks they have, that's pretty much unheard of. The owner has done a great job of bringing in talent. I think potentially they could be one of the best teams to ever play, if the talent plays together.''</p>

        <p>Michael Strahan did not intend to sound in awe of the Washington Redskins. None of the Giants appeared to be today. Strahan's glowing review of Washington's roster was conditional and echoed what is being discussed around the National Football League.</p>
        <p>''They definitely have more talent than anybody,'' he said before the Redskins fell to the Cowboys tonight, 27-21. ''To be able to get the free agents they have on top of the draft picks they have, that's pretty much unheard of. The owner has done a great job of bringing in talent. I think potentially they could be one of the best teams to ever play, if the talent plays together.''</p>
        <p>The Giants are 3-0, their offense is rejuvenated and their defense is again dominating. But they have defeated three teams with a combined 2-6 record, so playing host to the Redskins on Sunday night should be a good barometer for the Giants.  Most Giants, including Coach Jim Fassel, said they would watch tonight's game.</p>
        <p>''I'm a Cowboys fan tonight,'' said Strahan, who acknowledged the Giants would be viewed as underdogs Sunday. Linebacker Jessie Armstead echoed that feeling with a bit of sarcasm.</p>
        <p>''We're just fortunate that they're going to let us play the game, because if you look at the situation of all the players they have over there and everything they got, you're already predicting them to win,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fassel today discussed his new offensive line's cohesion and promoted the importance of team chemistry, but the opposite could hold true for Washington. The Redskins have endured a quarterback controversy that does not appear to be over, have lost receiver Michael Westbrook for the season with a knee injury and suffered a stunning loss at Detroit in Week 2.</p>
        <p>Fassel did not see the need to emphasize Sunday's game to players during his weekly speech today.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get too far into it,'' he said. ''This is going to be an emotional week anyhow. I'm not going to pound the drums right now. They can figure this one out for themselves.''</p>
        <p>The Giants, meanwhile, are coming off a 14-7 victory at Chicago that was not pretty. Today lacked the usual we-need-to-get-better comments from the locker room. It is not that the Giants cannot improve on Sunday's performance -- they will need to after missing three field goals and failing to put away the Bears -- but they are truly focused on Washington. Fassel broke from routine today by limiting viewings of the Bears game, instead of the usual in-depth analysis with coaches.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to spend any more time on that game,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Then there are Washington's two victories over the Giants last season, including an embarrassing 50-21 rout at Giants Stadium in Week 2 that set the tone for the season. Defensive tackle Keith Hamilton was the one player pushing the history angle, beginning immediately after Sunday's victory in Chicago.</p>
        <p>''I don't need anything posted on bulletin boards of what they're going to do to us,'' he said today. ''I remember what they did to us.''</p>
        <p>Hamilton was also cautious Sunday to remind anyone listening that he was on the last Giants team to start 3-0 in 1994. It went on to lose its next seven games.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Coach JIM FASSEL backed the assistant LARRY Mac DUFF, the special-teams coach whose unit has consistently performed poorly in Fassel's four seasons. Sunday, the unit was responsible for three botched field goals. Place-kicker BRAD DALUISO missed one, but a bad hold and a missed block caused two other kicks to be blocked. Fassel said he did not regret bringing back Mac Duff this season. ''I can evaluate coaches,'' Fassel said. ''I've made changes in coaches and I'll make changes when necessary. I'm not happy with a game like that. Larry isn't out there blocking.''</p>
        <p>Fassel agreed that Mac Duff was a scapegoat ''to a degree'' for the players' performances and noted that Mac Duff had been told not to add any more players from the first-team offense or defense because the Giants are dangerously thin at nearly every position.</p>
        <p>The rookie cornerback RALPH BROWN was found to have a lacerated kidney after Sunday's game and will miss six to eight weeks, Fassel said. Brown will remain in Chicago through Thursday but was not expected to require surgery. With RAMOS McDONALD not activated for a game yet and ANDRE WEATHERS expected back soon from an injury, Fassel said the team was deep enough in the defensive backfield not to put Brown on the injured reserve.</p>
