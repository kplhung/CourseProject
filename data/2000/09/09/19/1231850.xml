        <p>Just over a decade ago, the New York City Police Department replaced its conventional wooden nightsticks with a sleek, new tool: a side-handle baton fashioned out of hard plastic that required movements reminiscent of the martial arts.</p>
        <p>The department has now decided that less is more, and is returning to the standard nightstick, albeit an updated high-density plastic version. The current class of recruits is training with the straight nightsticks, and the department will later decide whether to entirely phase out the side-handle baton, known as the PR-24, which required complicated maneuvers and frequent retraining.</p>
        <p>''The PR-24 is essentially a martial-arts tool, and it takes a high level of training to keep a good level of retention,'' said the Police Department's director of training, Dr. James O'Keefe. ''When the officers came back for their annual retraining, they would have to go back and go through the basic moves again.''</p>
        <p>At the time of the switch in 1989, police officials said that the nightstick, which is simply gripped at one end, lent itself to downward blows and could more easily lead to an accidental strike to the head.</p>
        <p>The side-handle baton, which officers grip by a 5 1/2-inch handle that juts out about a hand's-breadth from the end and swing in a horizontal arc, was viwed as less likely to strike the head in high-stress situations. It was also seen as useful to an officer warding off an assailant's blows.</p>
        <p>But officers are trained to aim below the shoulders regardless of which baton they use, Dr. O'Keefe said.</p>
        <p>The PR-24 may be too high-tech for New Yorkers, but the Los Angeles Police Department will continue to use the handled stick. ''There's no data to suggest that it's difficult to use for our officers,'' said a Los Angeles department spokesman, Sgt. John Pasquariello. ''I've never even heard that before.''</p>
        <p>Ysaac Zorrilla, a New York City transit officer, was trained with the PR-24 and, he said, has never had a problem recalling maneuvers or maintaining his grip. ''If you get trained with this and this is the only thing you use, I don't know why you would find it difficult,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, the decision to switch, which was first reported yesterday in The Daily News, could prove wise, Officer Zorrilla said, if the department eventually adopts a new, collapsible baton that is used like a traditional nightstick.</p>
        <p>New York police officials yesterday would not discuss injuries or mishaps related to the use of the batons. ''There were no specific problems,'' said Dr. O'Keefe.</p>
