        <p>Maybe there really are no spells or hexes on the Mets, as they claim. Maybe when they play the Atlanta Braves, the Mets usually lose because they cannot hit the Braves' pitching. That is what happened tonight.</p>
        <p>Greg Maddux started and John Rocker finished, and the Mets were helpless against both. Two relievers pitched in between, prompting a sudden outburst of offense in the eighth inning. A homer, a double, two walks and a single gave the Mets three runs and cut the Braves' lead in half. Hope had returned.</p>
        <p>But then Rocker rambled in from the bullpen, and things returned to normal. Rocker, the combustible left-hander, is a wild, hard thrower; Maddux is baseball's preeminent control artist. They both dominated the Mets in a 6-3 decision that dropped the Mets four games behind Atlanta, their main rival in the National League East.</p>
        <p>''We've actually won games against them,'' Mets third baseman Robin Ventura said. ''But every time you lose a game, you hear, 'It's like you never beat them,' as far as the questions. We know they're a good team, and if they play their best, you're going to have to play even better to beat them. That's just the way it is.''</p>
        <p>But there is no mistaking the Mets' discomfort at Turner Field. They lost for the 19th time in their last 21 games in Atlanta, including three defeats in the National League Championship Series last fall. Starter Mike Hampton made his first Mets appearance here, but he quickly picked up the pattern, allowing five runs in six innings.</p>
        <p>The Braves are tough, but the Mets, catcher Mike Piazza said, are tight.</p>
        <p>''They come out and they are up for us, no question,'' he said. ''But we come in here, and for some reason just play a little tight, don't execute when we should. If we knew how to change it, obviously we would. It's kind of frustrating. But we're a team that's battled all year.''</p>
        <p>Maddux (18-8) took much of the fight from them this time. He allowed only five singles over seven shutout innings and was supported by brilliant defense, including his own.</p>
        <p>The Mets' runs came when Kerry Ligtenberg and Mike Remlinger relieved in the eighth. Derek Bell's homer, Piazza's double and Ventura's single got the Mets going, and they had two runners on and two outs when Rocker came in. But Bubba Trammell, the Mets' best power threat off the bench, was the pinch-hitter for Mike Bordick and popped to short to end the inning.</p>
        <p>In the ninth, Edgardo Alfonzo fouled out with Bell at first to end the game.</p>
        <p>The Mets were trying to become the first team in four years to beat Maddux three times in one season. They pounded him on July 1 at Shea Stadium, knocking him out after two innings as he battled the flu, and beat him again in late July, though he was much sharper.</p>
        <p>Maddux is at his best now. He pitched shutouts in his previous two starts, and his performance tonight gave him 29 1/3 consecutive scoreless innings. He reached 18 victories for the ninth time in his career, and it has been more than 30 innings since he issued a walk.</p>
        <p>''There's guys that overpower you, and guys that try to trick you,'' Mets center fielder Jay Payton said. ''He's a guy that tries to trick you, and he's been very successful at doing so.''</p>
        <p>Hampton (13-10) has been successful since his first start in May, with a 2.23 earned run average from then until tonight. But he fell behind and struggled with command of his inside pitches. The Braves, who feast on left-handers, were able to whack Hampton's outside pitches. And Hampton continued to receive little support from his teammates; in 30 innings over his last four starts, the Mets have scored one run.</p>
        <p>Andres Galarraga was in the middle of all three scoring rallies off Hampton. Galarraga, who has a .395 career average off Hampton, had two doubles to the warning track and also hit a line drive off Hampton's right wrist.</p>
        <p>Leading off the second, Galarraga took a high fastball and doubled to right-center. Reggie Sanders rolled a grounder to short, but Bordick double-clutched and chose the sure out, at first. ''If I would have gotten that ball clean,'' Bordick said, ''I would have thrown to third.''</p>
        <p>Because he didn't, Walt Weiss tried a squeeze bunt, pushing ball perhaps 30 feet, between first base and the mound. Hampton scrambled for it but lost his balance as he picked it up he flung a wild throw past Piazza at home. Galarraga scored to put the Braves ahead, 1-0. ''I tried to do it all in one motion, to get rid of it quick,'' Hampton said. ''I was unable to follow through and made a bad play.''</p>
        <p>Worse trouble came in the third, when Hampton issued a leadoff walk and three singles followed, putting the Braves up, 3-0. With runners at the corners, Galarraga smashed a pitch back up the middle, where it hit off Hampton's wrist, knocking his glove loose.</p>
        <p>Hampton kept his composure, looking the runner back to third and firing to first for the out. X-rays on the wrist were negative, and Hampton said it did not affect him. A soft chopper scored the Braves' fourth run, and Galarraga doubled home another in the fifth inning.</p>
        <p>Hampton lasted six innings, allowing five runs, six hits and five walks, two intentional. He was not interested in discussing what it means to play the Braves; the Mets must first worry about securing a playoff spot.</p>
        <p>Viewed that way, the Mets' struggles with the Braves are not so crushing. The Mets (85-65) began the day leading Arizona by 5 games; the Diamondbacks played at Los Angeles later tonight. But the Mets play five more regular-season games with Atlanta, and that is enough cause for concern.</p>
        <p>''We'll keep an eye on Arizona,'' Bell said. ''Make sure they don't sneak up on us.''</p>
