        <p>Their suburban house, crammed with five grand pianos, sounds like a conservatory. Shelves in the den are lined with plaques and trophies from music competitions. So many of them attend the Juilliard School that their teachers have trouble keeping them straight.</p>
        <p>The Brown family adds a new twist to the idea that music sometimes runs in families. All five siblings, ages 14 to 21, are studying piano at Juilliard, where two are are freshmen, two are seniors, and the fifth is in the pre-college division.</p>
        <p>School officials say it is a first at the conservatory, which has just 113 piano students, accepts only one of every nine applicants and whose enrollment represents three dozen counties. But what also seems to strike many who know the Brown children is the image of harmony that they project, particularly as they travel the same highly competitive road to professional piano careers.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing how different they are in their music making and the direction of their talent,'' said Yoheved Kaplinsky, one of Juilliard's most popular teachers and chairwoman of the piano department, who teaches all five.</p>
        <p>''It is difficult to say at this point which one will succeed the most,'' Ms. Kaplinsky said. ''I do know that each one is talented enough to make a niche for themselves in the music world if they so choose.''</p>
        <p>The Browns were transplanted from Utah to the New York area purely to attend Juilliard. They are untouched so far by the commercial possibilities of becoming the classical version of another musical Mormon family from Utah, the Osmonds, who started out singing on television in the 1970's. Nevertheless the Browns are cannily aware of those possibilities, along with the potential dangers of sibling rivalry.</p>
        <p>Furthest along the track are the two eldest, both seniors -- Desirae, 21, and Deondra, 20. Next are Gregory, 17, and Melody, 16. Ryan, 14, attends the pre-college program.</p>
        <p>Ryan is being home-schooled, as were his siblings, a form of education that their parents, Lisa and Keith Brown, both 44, said was the only way the children could find time to practice four to six hours a day as well as lead normal lives.</p>
        <p>All five, who are strikingly similar in appearance -- with lanky frames and blond hair -- have studied with a single teacher at every stage. Yet each appears to have a distinctive musical personality.</p>
        <p>Desirae is emotive as a player but quieter in person, while Deondra is the more outgoing and assertive organizer, Ms. Kaplinsky said. ''She's the one who puts things together,'' she said.</p>
        <p>During a joint interview Deondra took the lead in a conversation that flowed on a wave of giggles, mutually completed sentences, teasing jabs and quick asides. There is not a piercing or tattoo among them, and only Deondra has taken a daring fashion step. She wears a toe ring.</p>
        <p>The elder sisters form a piano duo and will play with the Westchester Philharmonic on Oct. 29 and with the Philadelphia Orchestra on Feb. 14 as winners of a young artists competition. The duo has attracted the interest of a major management agency. The family says it spurned a previous approach from a California producer and promoter because his ideas would have brought them into the pop realm.</p>
        <p>With his large hands -- they cover the interval of a 12th, the width of 12 white keys -- Gregory is the virtuoso, the one who plays the big pieces and ''gets all the girls swoony,'' said Deondra. Melody is known in the family as the expressive player, an elegant interpreter of Mozart.</p>
        <p>Ryan stands out for his spunk, teachers and family say. ''When he plays, he can truly tell you a story,'' Ms. Kaplinsky said. ''There's so much imagination, so much life in his playing.''</p>
        <p>This carving out of musical personalities serves as one defense mechanism against corrosive competitiveness, family members say.  For the same reason the siblings avoid working on the same piece simultaneously. Their parents reinforce a sense of clan enterprise to keep egos in check, which was particularly important during the siblings' younger years, when they were often rivals in piano competitions.</p>
        <p>''Of course we want to win,'' said Gregory. If not oneself, it is better if the winner is a member of the family, he said.</p>
        <p>Still, some who do not know the family wonder just how harmonious they can possibly be.</p>
        <p>That question was raised by Margery Franklin, a professor at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y., who specializes in the psychology of art. She also questioned the wisdom of having all five study with the same teacher, though both the family and Ms. Kaplinsky express satisfaction with the arrangement. Ms. Kaplinsky, the Browns say, is a major reason the three younger children came to Juilliard, and hence the family to New York.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to say whether it's healthy or not, but this was the wish of the family,'' Ms. Kaplinsky said. ''As a human being it is very difficult to say to one, 'I'll teach you,' and to the other, 'Go to someone else.' ''</p>
        <p>The young pianists are keenly aware of the potential for rivalry. Mention of the tennis-playing Williams sisters brings animated talk, and the Brown siblings say they closely follow the fortunes of the pair, Venus and Serena.</p>
        <p>''It's not the Brady Bunch,'' Ms. Kaplinsky said. ''But the nice thing about it is they know how to resolve conflicts. The bottom line is the family needs to remain intact. Somebody always knows how to back off enough to continue.''</p>
        <p>But the Browns do not hide their awareness that strength lies in numbers. ''They draw attention to each other,'' Keith Brown, the father, said. ''You probably wouldn't be here if it was just Ryan.'' As Deondra put it: ''It's nice we have a little gimmick. We're sisters. We're both at Juilliard.''</p>
        <p>The older sisters are trying to position themselves as heirs to the Labeque sisters, Katia and Marielle, one of the most prominent piano duos of the past 20 years.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of things they do well,'' Deondra said of the Labeques. Desirae added, ''There are some things we can do better.''</p>
        <p>Plenty of families have had musical siblings: the Chungs (Myung-Wha, cellist; Kyung-Wha, violinist; Myung-So, flutist; and Myung-Whun, pianist and conductor), the Kavafians (Ani, violinist, and Ida, violist); the original Galimir quartet (Felix and his sisters Adrienne, Renee and Marguerite); the Menuhins (Yehudi, violinist; Hepzibah, pianist); the Mozarts (Nannerl, piano; Wolfgang, genius).</p>
        <p>But five pianists? And all at the same conservatory?</p>
        <p>One parallel is the Schrades, a family of New York pianists who have been teaching and concertizing together and separately for years and who together run a summer music festival. They include the parents, Robert and Rolande, and the children, Robelyn, 46; Randolph, 39; and Rorianne, 36.</p>
        <p>In the Schrades' case, the children studied with their parents. But unlike the parents in many musical families, neither Mr. or Mrs. Brown is a professional musician, though Mrs. Brown trained as an opera singer and her husband sang with his family at home and in church. Mrs. Brown's mother played piano by ear but could not read music.</p>
        <p>That background may help explain why so much talent is concentrated in this family. But obviously other factors are at work. The elder ones kept up the piano because they were good at it. The younger ones followed an activity that seemed part of normal life. The high standard raised the game of each individual.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Brown keeps a close eye on practice sessions, and Mr. Brown, who studied dentistry at the University of Texas in Houston, said he took a job as a buyer for a car dealer and then quit even that position to spend more time with the children. He now works as a broker of used Steinway pianos and luxury cars and as a financial consultant to a personal-injury law firm in Texas and Utah. The Browns sold their house in Alpine, Utah, five years ago to move to the New York area.</p>
        <p>The family lives in a rented five-bedroom brick house in Hartsdale, N.Y., that is unusually clutter-free. Not a sheet of music lay on the five pianos inside. Two pianos fill half the basement, where the Book of Mormon stands on a shelf next to a recording of Handel's Messiah. Another piano sits in front of a bay window in the living room. Another is in the finished attic, and the fifth is wedged into the parents' room, so close to the bed that Mr. Brown once cut his head on the cover in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>''If you stand in one place, you can hear Saint-Saens in one room, Chopin in another, Rachmaninoff in another,'' said Mr. Brown, who often  goes outdoors to speak on the phone.</p>
        <p>In the mornings the siblings race to reach their favorite instrument, one of the basement pair. The unspoken rule: never try to kick someone off the stool. When one quits to do chores, another takes over.</p>
        <p>Money is a problem. ''We're always in financial crisis,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>This year the Browns' bill for Juilliard tuition, room and board (the two freshmen are required to spend a year on campus) will total $87,000.  The students receive partial scholarships and have taken out loans. Lisa Brown's father pays half the Hartsdale rent, in exchange for room and board for Mrs. Brown's sister, a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Three of the five pianos in the house are being held by Mr. Brown on consignment, waiting to be sold.</p>
        <p>He said that all the sacrifices were worth it. But he sometimes sounds a bit perplexed at how his life has come to revolve around 88 keys, or more precisely, 440.</p>
        <p>''We just wanted the kids to learn to play a little bit, so they could play in church and play Christmas carols around the piano for their kids,'' he said. ''But it just kind of took on its own life.''</p>
