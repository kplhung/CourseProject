        <p>A federal judge has ruled that Texas regulators cannot discipline a medical director at UnitedHealthcare, one of the nation's largest health insurers, for denying treatment to a boy whose doctor had said the treatment was medically necessary.</p>
        <p>The case has been closely watched by state medical officials and physicians' groups as states have increasingly tried to make medical directors at health maintenance organizations and other managed care groups subject to the same licensing and disciplinary oversight as other doctors. About half of the states, including Texas, require H.M.O. medical directors -- who make decisions about whether to pay for treatments -- to be licensed physicians.</p>
        <p>In this case, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners had accused one of UnitedHealthcare's medical directors of refusing proper medical care when he decided two years ago to deny at-home skilled nursing for the boy, David Wiser, 13, who had spent five weeks in a Fort Worth hospital after suffering respiratory failure. UnitedHealthcare said the treatment was ''custodial care'' and thus not covered by the health plan.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, the Wiser family had other health insurance, administered through a separate subsidiary of UnitedHealthcare, which is a unit of the Minneapolis-based UnitedHealth Group, and that subsidiary agreed to pay for the treatment.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Texas officials proposed sanctions against the UnitedHealthcare medical director who denied the treatment, Dr. David W. Ellis, including a fine and a public reprimand. In March, UnitedHealthcare sued the state, saying the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a 1974 federal law that governs employee benefit plans, bars state officials from disciplining managed care medical directors for decisions about whether to pay for treatments.</p>
        <p>In a Sept. 8 ruling, Judge Barbara M. G. Lynn of the United States District Court in Dallas ruled that Dr. Ellis had made a decision only on coverage and had not been practicing medicine when he refused treatment. Discipline by the state over such coverage determinations, she wrote, is pre-empted by federal law.</p>
        <p>John Cornyn, the Texas attorney general, said in a written statement that the judge had not addressed the key issue in the case and that he was considering appealing the decision.</p>
        <p>''The court left unanswered the very question we need resolved -- whether Erisa pre-empts the regulation of H.M.O. medical directors who make medical decisions,'' Mr. Cornyn said. ''When it comes to medical decisions made by H.M.O.'s in the state of Texas, it is the state's responsibility to oversee these decisions, not the federal government's.''</p>
        <p>David J. Lubben, general counsel for UnitedHealth Group, said the ruling supported the company's position that decisions company officials make about treatment coverage are ''not the subject of state medical regulation.'' He added: ''The thing that's important about this case is to remember that the child got the treatment.''</p>
