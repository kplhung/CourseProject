        <p>The truckers and farmers whose protest over fuel prices brought Britain to a virtual standstill last week have claimed another victim -- the eight-year-long lead in opinion polls that the Labor party has held over the Conservatives.</p>
        <p>Surveys published in two weekend newspapers showed the Tories neck and neck with Labor in one case and two points ahead in the other, the first time the Tories have held voters' preference since shortly after the victory in 1992 of John Major, then the prime minister.</p>
        <p>More important in terms of longer-range damage to the government case, the polls showed disenchantment in the two areas dearest to Prime Minister Tony Blair and the party he has recast as New Labor -- its hard-earned reputation for competence in running the economy and responsiveness to the hopes of Britain's middle class.</p>
        <p>The timing is awkward for Labor since next week the party gathers in Brighton for its annual conference, dedicated this year to forming a battle plan for the election expected in May. The high point is a rallying speech by Mr. Blair, and he will now appear before the party faithful as a diminished leader.</p>
        <p>There is irony in Mr. Blair's high flying popularity being brought to ground by the grievances of Britain's drivers.</p>
        <p>Before the 1997 election that put him in office, he identified as the model voter that New Labor needed a man in his district who complained to him about past Labor governments' tendency to tax and spend away the fresh gains of the aspiring middle class. Mr. Blair mentioned that the man was washing his Ford Sierra during the conversation, and thus was born Sierraman, the Everyman target for Labor campaigners.</p>
        <p>Last week Sierraman turned rebellious and broke free of New Labor's clutches. Led by a Welsh farmer named Brynle Williams, small groups of picketers camped out in folding chairs at the gates of refineries and storage depots across the country, blocking deliveries and succeeding in drying up all but a few of Britain's 13,000 filling stations.</p>
        <p>Nine of 10 Britons said they supported the protest against the soaring costs of Britain's highly taxed gasoline. Mr. Blair responded by calling the protesters' actions an ''affront,'' pledging not to be intimidated by them and predicting that normality would start returning in 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Their effectiveness caught Mr. Blair by surprise, and his scolding reaction alienated the movement's backers and deepened his association in their minds as their tormentor. He and his cabinet ministers tried to shift blame to rogue truck drivers, OPEC and the oil companies, but polls over the weekend showed that the public held him and his government responsible.</p>
        <p>Ministers put forward the argument that any cut in the tax would result in cuts in social services, but British motorists, who drive on Europe's most congested roads and live in the country with Europe's poorest public transportation, were unimpressed.</p>
        <p>''All of us have been conscious of an undercurrent of opinion on petrol prices, but I don't think we appreciated the combustible character of the issue and the way in which it burst into flames last week,'' Martin O'Neill, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, told the BBC today.</p>
        <p>Government ministers said they felt the sudden shift in the polls reflected a blip rather than a trend and that with time Mr. Blair's unyielding response to the wildcat actions would gain public support. ''I'd be much more interested in the polls in a month's time,'' said Geoff Hoon, the defense secretary. ''I accept that if the polls are still as dreadful then, we will clearly have a problem.''</p>
        <p>William Hague, who has faced an uphill battle in his three years as Conservative leader convincing voters that he could be Britain's next prime minister, quickly moved to cash in on the change in his party's fortunes. ''For a prime minister who once prided himself on being in touch with the people,'' he wrote in today's Daily Telegraph, ''Mr. Blair has become the only person in the country who has no idea what is going on.''</p>
        <p>Misjudging public opinion is particularly embarrassing to the Blair government since it has made a point of taking the nation's pulse through frequent focus group soundings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair is haunted by the record of undisciplined past Labor governments losing control and believes that he must keep a firm grip or suffer the same consequences. In 1979 Prime Minister James Callaghan appeared nonchalant in the face of widespread work stoppages, and a result was the so-called ''winter of discontent'' in which strikes halted essential services and speeded the end of a Labor government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair pointedly stressed last week that no responsible government could make sound policy based on reactive moves to sudden unrest. In response to criticism that he was not listening to the public, he said, ''Governments must listen, but governments must govern.''</p>
        <p>The hastily organized and fast-spreading protest, which the estimated 2,500 participants coordinated by mobile telephones and e-mail, caught fire because of the intensity of feeling against the soaring price of gasoline and diesel fuel. The tax bite in Britain, 76.2 percent of the price of gas, is the highest in Europe, and with the rise of crude oil prices the cost of filling a normal sedan has passed $90.</p>
        <p>But the demonstrators also tapped into feelings of resentment in the British countryside, newly politicized by a continuing battle over efforts to ban hunting with hounds, where New Labor is derided by critics as a party of the urban elite.</p>
        <p>Many members of Mr. Blair's cabinet come from a generation that marched and demonstrated in the 1970's, but that did not prepare them to sympathize with protests mounted by conservative rural interests like self-employed truckers and farmers. Significantly, the labor unions, who were responsible for the paralyzing strikes of 1979, condemned the blockades of last week as ''not a legitimate form of industrial action but a challenge to democracy and crude attempt to hold the country to ransom.''</p>
        <p>With its overwhelming majority in Parliament, the government has been able to do pretty much what it wants, and one result has been a growing sense of disfranchisement in the British public. A government that devolved national power by creating regional legislatures is now being portrayed as distant and arrogant, and a prime minister who was thought to be a master of communication and contact is now pictured as tone deaf and out of touch.</p>
