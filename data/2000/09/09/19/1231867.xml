        <p>Is there a team in the National Football League with a more daunting task this week than the Jets? Take on perhaps the best team in the league. And try to ignore the loudest mouth.</p>
        <p>It is hard to say which is going to be more difficult.</p>
        <p>When the Jets head to Tampa, Fla., to face the Buccaneers on Sunday in the week's premier game, they will encounter the league's most intimidating team, one with a stellar defense and an offense that has scored 93 points in three games.</p>
        <p>But a game that could send the Jets to 4-0 -- the Buccaneers, like the Jets, are among the five undefeated teams remaining -- could become a mere subplot to the melodrama that is Keyshawn Johnson.</p>
        <p>Seldom has a professional player overstayed a departure quite the way Johnson has. Since his trade just before the N.F.L. draft in April, Johnson has not stopped dishing about Coach Al Groh, about Wayne Chrebet, about how Sept. 24 was circled on his calendar.</p>
        <p>Sunday is Sept. 24. Brace yourself.</p>
        <p>Johnson, who has caught 14 passes for 180 yards and 1 touchdown so far, began the week by announcing just after he had played superbly in Tampa Bay's 31-10 victory over the Detroit Lions that he would not shake hands with Groh, and by comparing himself to a star while comparing Chrebet, his eternal nemesis, to merely a flashlight.</p>
        <p>The Jets began the week today by sounding as if they had spent their early meetings submitting to brainwashing. As hard as Johnson seems to want to suck them into the teeth of his oral barrage, the Jets are pulling just as hard in the other direction, all but handing out tape for their mouths in the locker room.</p>
        <p>''Mum's the word on him,'' said center Kevin Mawae, who could not quite hold out. ''We're not even going to worry about what he has to say. I could care less. There are some guys that handle themselves with class and some that don't, and I'll just leave it at that. It's like two dogs fighting in the pen. If you jump in, you're going to get bitten.''</p>
        <p>Mawae was the most outspoken Jets player today -- the only one, in fact -- clearly chafing at Johnson's mouthiness. Mawae's theory is that Johnson is seeking attention and that he cannot quite adjust to the smaller size of the news media contingent in Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>''We moved on when training camp started,'' Mawae said. ''Some people stay in place and run on the treadmill, and other people hit the ground and make headway. There are people I've been disappointed with in my career. I was able to come back and look them in the face and say it was great working for you. Whether it's a sense of jealousy or insecurity, without saying anything bad about anybody else, if you're going to be a professional athlete, be a professional about it.''</p>
        <p>The Jets, Mawae notwithstanding, are clearly trying not to say too much about Johnson. Several players developed blank expressions when his name was mentioned today, and Chrebet was notable by his absence from the locker room.</p>
        <p>Groh has taken the brunt of Johnson's attacks, that the coach pulled the trigger on the trade, supposedly without the support of the former coach, Bill Parcells.</p>
        <p>When Groh was asked about Johnson repeatedly during his daily news conference, he spoke his words with such care that someone might have thought he was giving testimony under oath:</p>
        <p>What do you think about Johnson saying he won't shake your hand if you extend it to him?</p>
        <p>''That's his prerogative,'' Groh said. ''I don't have any other comment on it besides that.''</p>
        <p>Will you try to shake Johnson's hand?</p>
        <p>''If that's convenient. I wouldn't have any problem with that.''</p>
        <p>How do you feel about Johnson blaming you alone for the trade?</p>
        <p>''I don't have any resentment about it.''</p>
        <p>Was the Johnson trade the toughest decision you've had to make? Did you lose sleep over it?</p>
        <p>''That was a challenging decision. I thought and thought and thought. I try not to take football into bed.''</p>
        <p>But imagine if the Jets were losing. They are playing the Buccaneers at the best possible time. The Jets' offense has still not played as well as it can. But the Jets beat the Bills, their best opponent so far, with a defense that shut out Buffalo in the second half; special-teams play that rose from the dead; and a well-timed offense.</p>
        <p>The Jets' running game, which was facing a run defense that was allowing an average of 46.5 yards and was ranked second in the league, gained 91 yards. Groh showed his confidence in the running game when he punched his hand in the air to signal the offense to go on fourth-and-1 from the Bills' 5. Curtis Martin, who had 84 yards, scored to give the Jets an early lead.</p>
        <p>The Buccaneers' defense is even more formidable, ranked in the top three in the league in nine defensive categories before tonight's Redskins-Cowboys game. Opponents are averaging only 155 yards passing against them and have converted only 17.9 percent of third-down attempts. The Buccaneers are second in the league in points allowed, having given up a total of 26 points in three games.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay's defense is already being compared with some of the great ones in league history.</p>
        <p>''They're playing better than anybody right now,'' Mawae said.</p>
        <p>And at least one of them is talking better, too. ''He's just another player,'' Mawae said of Johnson. ''He's a great player, but he's not the entire team there and he wasn't the entire team here.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>AL GROH said he does not feel vindicated that, against all expectations, his team has started so well. ''I don't think I can be vindicated from anything since there's still a good chance I can be sitting up here at 3-13,'' he said. . . . The Jets have been told that the grass in the middle of the field at Giants Stadium will be replaced this week. The Jets have been unhappy with the field's condition.</p>
