        <p>Gail Collins Op-Ed column on media coverage of presidential campaigns of Gov George W Bush and Vice Pres Al Gore and of election campaign by Republican Repr Rick Lazio for US Senate seat from New York (M)</p>

        <p>There is a strong feeling on the part of many political campaigns that reporters have way too much time on their hands. They write a story every time George W. Bush backward speaks the sentence written. Or they point out that Al Gore once mistranslated ''e pluribus unum.''</p>
        <p>They make a big deal out of small matters, like that ''rats'' frame in the TV commercial, or the fact that Dick Cheney ran a company that had special Americans-only bathrooms in its offices overseas. They even took note when the Republican Senate candidate in Connecticut called Joe Lieberman ''a very moral man, a very Christian man.''</p>

        <p>There is a strong feeling on the part of many political campaigns that reporters have way too much time on their hands. They write a story every time George W. Bush backward speaks the sentence written. Or they point out that Al Gore once mistranslated ''e pluribus unum.''</p>
        <p>They make a big deal out of small matters, like that ''rats'' frame in the TV commercial, or the fact that Dick Cheney ran a company that had special Americans-only bathrooms in its offices overseas. They even took note when the Republican Senate candidate in Connecticut called Joe Lieberman ''a very moral man, a very Christian man.''</p>
        <p>It's true. We'll do anything to avoid having to deconstruct the tax cut plans again.</p>
        <p>Yesterday there was a flap about whether Mr. Gore had misstated the cost of medicine for his labrador, Shiloh, in a speech on the high price of prescription drugs. ''Frankly, I would expect better from the vice president,'' said Mr. Cheney, more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
        <p>(Don't bother to send Shiloh get-well cards. Just form a committee, collect some soft money, and run a few TV commercials suggesting that people call Al Gore and thank him for taking care of his dog.)</p>
        <p>This year the media are leaving no anecdote unexamined, canine or otherwise. Mr. Bush constantly quotes an unnamed Texas woman who once berated him for failing to ''ask for my vote.'' But Jim Dwyer of The Daily News recently pointed out that when Tip O'Neill used to tell the story, the woman lived in Boston.</p>
        <p>All of this brings us to Rick Lazio, the New York Republican Senate candidate. Mr. Lazio has been verbally snakebit recently. He got caught misquoting Casey Stengel and indicating that he thinks the legal voting age is 21. (He also was overheard saying something vaguely deprecatory about the sausage at an upstate fair, but that would count as an issue story.)</p>
        <p>Last week Mr. Lazio gave a speech at a high school in Syosset, on Long Island. He did not, as they say, make news. ''The things you're going to see are unbelievable,'' he assured the teenagers, who sat very attentively waiting to hear what the unbelievable things of the future would be.</p>
        <p>''They're developing robots to make robots. Pretty crazy, huh?'' the congressman continued. ''That's the existence you're going to live through.''</p>
        <p>Having psyched up the crowd, Mr. Lazio talked about cracking down on troublemakers in school, and told the students that 40 years ago, principals said their biggest problems were kids chewing gum in class, talking out of turn and running down the hall. Now, he added, the top problems are ''rape, drug abuse, alcoholism and assault.''</p>
        <p>This is one of Mr. Lazio's favorite stories. ''He tells it all the time,'' said an aide later. It is also the equivalent of an urban legend. Back in 1994, Barry O'Neill, a professor at the School of Organization and Management at Yale University, tracked the original list back to T. Cullen Davis, a wealthy Texan who had weathered a sensational murder trial in his home state and then turned to fundamentalist Christianity. Mr. Davis claimed he had based the list on memories of his own happy school days and observation of the less satisfactory state of the modern world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign said yesterday that the congressman found the list ''in a survey'' that the staff was trying to locate.</p>
        <p>At the same high school visit, Mr. Lazio told the students there were schools in his own Long Island Congressional district that still had to use science books that were written 30 years ago. ''They're using what their parents used,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Inquiring minds immediately wanted to know where this school was, but Mr. Lazio refused to say.</p>
        <p>''I don't want them to feel too badly,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio was also asked what he'd been doing to keep his constituents from spending their formative years reading science texts written before the dawn of the computer age.</p>
        <p>''I opened up a dialogue and told them I'd like to help.''</p>
        <p>Now what are we supposed to make of all this? Should the media feel bad for asking picky questions instead of concentrating on the main points at hand? (Robots making robots!) Are we supposed to wonder whether the school exists at all? Presume it does exist and chide Mr. Lazio for not fixing the problem?</p>
        <p>Maybe we should think positive and congratulate him for not dragging Shiloh into the fight.</p>
