        <p>MemberWorks Inc., a national telemarketing company based in Stamford, Conn., that provides memberships in discount programs for credit card holders, has settled allegations of abusive sales practices brought by the New York State attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer said yesterday that the company had obtained customer names and card numbers from financial institutions. MemberWorks then offered the card holders free 30-day trial memberships in the discount programs, which offer savings on various products and services.</p>
        <p>At the end of the 30 days, Mr. Spitzer said, MemberWorks charged  many who had signed up for the free trial an annual membership fee of up to $144, without their knowledge. ''Many who accepted the initial free trial did not understand that MemberWorks had access to their credit card numbers,'' he said, ''and would charge them if they failed to cancel during the trial period.''</p>
        <p>He said the company agreed to disclose the conditions of accepting membership and the fact that it already had the customers' credit card numbers for automatic billing. In agreeing to the settlement, MemberWorks did not admit wrongdoing.</p>
