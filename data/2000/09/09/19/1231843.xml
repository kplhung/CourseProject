        <p>WITH education supposed to be the crucial issue, both New York candidates for the Senate are busy visiting schools and promising large sums of money. The figures sound impressive, but it might be useful if the candidates paused at the schools' blackboards long enough to work on a few problems:</p>
        <p>Rick, a candidate for United States Senate, has proposed a total of $98 billion in new federal spending on education over the next decade. His opponent, Hillary, has proposed a total of $130 billion.</p>
        <p>If there are 69 million students in America from kindergarten through university level, how much does each candidate propose to spend on each student per year?</p>
        <p>If Rick fulfills his promises, the government will spend a grand total of $142.02 per year more on each student. Hillary's proposals would mean an additional $46.39. That will probably not loom large to anyone who has paid a tuition bill.</p>
        <p>It's not that Rick Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton are fiscal conservatives. They're proposing hefty budget increases. But the federal government provides a mere 9 percent of the money spent on education in America, so the increases don't make much difference. National politicians love to talk about schools, but the bills are paid by parents and local and state governments.</p>
        <p>The average New Yorker sends $5,676 to Washington in taxes each year. Washington sends $4,840 back in spending programs. If there are 18 million New Yorkers, how much are they losing? And is there any reason they would want to give Washington another excuse to spend their money elsewhere?</p>
        <p>In all, the state gets back $15 billion less than it sends to Washington each year, as computed by Jay H. Walder and Herman B. Leonard of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. New Yorkers pay above-average taxes and get below-average returns, so on the whole they would be better off with tax cuts than with new spending programs.</p>
        <p>But the state doesn't do badly in all areas. While New York ranks 48th in its per capita share of the military budget, it benefits from programs aimed at poor people. Because of its high poverty rate, it ranks first among states in its per capita payments from welfare programs, and it also does relatively well on education programs aimed primarily at the poor.</p>
        <p>When it comes to overall federal spending on education, New York gets the 16th-highest per capita share, according to calculations by Dr. Walder. So there's something to be said for the enthusiasm of Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio: if Washington is going to spend money, New York is better off having the money spent on education than on most other things.</p>
        <p>BUT while New York is getting a little more than its share of the education pot, you have to remember who filled the pot. New York ranks 13th in the per capita share of taxes paid. So even when Congress sends some educational dollars this way, New York is essentially just getting back its own money, minus a few expenses in Washington.</p>
        <p>Still, breaking even isn't bad, especially for city dwellers who look to Washington for redressing economic inequalities. Using federal tax collectors can be the most effective way to transfer money from affluent suburbanites to inner-city students, as New York City officials have found after fighting losing battles in Albany to redistribute the suburbs' wealth.</p>
        <p>''The city schools often fare better in Washington than in Albany,'' said Stephen Allinger, the executive director of the office of intergovernmental affairs for the city Board of Education. ''Some of the federal programs aren't fair to New York, but in general federal aid is far more focused on need than state aid is.''</p>
        <p>In theory, then, New York City could benefit if Mr. Lazio or Mrs. Clinton persuaded Congress to shift spending to education from the many programs that enrich other states. But that will be hard to do, given the most stubborn math problem of all.</p>
        <p>The 1.4 million inhabitants of North Dakota and South Dakota pay a total of $6 billion in annual federal taxes. The 18.2 million inhabitants of New York pay $103 billion. Suppose the money is pooled and stacked on a table in a Senate committee room. New York's two senators want to spend it on education. The four senators from the Dakotas want to spend it on agricultural assistance.</p>
        <p>What are the odds that wheat farmers will be driving new John Deere tractors next spring?</p>
