        <p>The United States has been pressing Russia not to proceed with plans to sell Iran laser technology that Washington says can be used to make fuel for nuclear weapons, according to Administration officials.</p>
        <p>Officials said that since July President Clinton has raised the prospective sale of laser technology at least two times in meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin. The most recent occurred this month at the United Nations summit meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin assured Mr. Clinton then that Russia would work with Washington to resolve the dispute, officials with knowledge of the discussions said. American officials said they were encouraged by that pledge.</p>
        <p>But they also called the response ambiguous, because Russian and American technical advisers disagreed with each other over whether the equipment could help Iran in what Washington contends is a secret program to acquire nuclear bombs.</p>
        <p>The administration officials said that Russian sales of nuclear technology to Iran had been a longstanding concern, but that the administration grew particularly worried about the laser equipment after an American private fuel provider abandoned the product, deciding that it was not economically competitive in a civilian nuclear program. And given America's own troubles in trying to develop a cost-efficient laser technology, the United States is said to believe that Iran was more likely to want to make weapons than to develop commercial plants. The United States apparently believes that the technology is too expensive for refining nuclear fuel for commercial uses and is mostly suited to producing fissionable material for bombs. As a result, the United States has been working for three months to dissuade Russia from letting a center associated with the D. V. Efremov Institute of St. Petersburg, part of the Atomic Energy Ministry, from proceeding with a contract to sell the technology to Iran.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton raised the prospective deal with Mr. Putin in July in private talks at a Group of 8 meeting in Japan. The contract has also been raised by Vice President Al Gore and Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, with their counterparts.</p>
        <p>Officials said the issue was also scheduled to be discussed over the weekend by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who met on Sunday with the Russian atomic energy minister, Yevgeny O. Adamov, at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency. That organization helps states that rule out nuclear weapons and monitors their civilian nuclear centers to ensure that they are not being used for military purposes.</p>
        <p>American allegations that Russia provides critical technology to Iran has roiled their relations for years. American intelligence agencies have long believed that Iran has a secret program to develop nuclear weapons, as well as biological and chemical weapons, dating from the rule of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, which ended with the 1979 revolution. Given its ample oil and gas resources, Iran's desire to generate electricity with nuclear power, the analysts argued, was automatically seen as suspicious.</p>
        <p>Russian nuclear contacts with Tehran have expanded since 1995, when cash-strapped Moscow signed a contract with Iran to complete the Bushehr nuclear power station, which its German builders abandoned in 1979, at the onset of the revolution. Despite pressure by the Clinton administration and sanctions by Congress, which halved foreign aid to Russia's central government in the last two years, Russia has refused to abandon the project.</p>
        <p>American officials reportedly do not regard Bushehr as a source of nuclear material that could be diverted to a bomb-making program. But the administration apparently fears that the project will train an entire generation of Iranian physicists and engineers in nuclear technologies, thus enhancing the nuclear scientific base, including any program to develop nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>Russian and Iranian officials argue that Iran has ruled out nuclear weapons and has put the Bushehr plant under the international agency's rules and safeguards.</p>
        <p>Russia has refused to forgo revenue from Bushehr and future reactor sales, each of which could run up to $1 billion. But former President Boris N. Yeltsin pledged not to expand nuclear cooperation with Iran beyond Bushehr, which plans up to four reactor and turbine units.</p>
        <p>Last spring, however, the United States learned that the Science and Technology Center of Microtechnology, a unit of the Efremov Institute, had signed a contract to provide the laser equipment to Iran. Separating isotopes is costly, intensive in time and energy and essential to making  nuclear bombs or fuel for light water civilian reactors to generate electrical power.</p>
        <p>To make a nuclear bomb or reactor fuel, uranium 235, whose atoms are used in chain reactions, has to be separated from the dominant uranium 238 isotope. The United States uses gaseous diffusion. Some Europeans and Russia use centrifuge technology to separate the U-235 from U-238, which is not good for making weapons.</p>
        <p>The United States has developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory a third method, laser isotope separation, that can be used to separate fissile isotopes from both uranium and plutonium, both of which can be used in nuclear bombs.</p>
        <p>The United States also had an extensive program to develop the laser isotope separation technology, known as Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation, or Avlis, for commercial purposes. It hoped that Avlis reactor fuel could be enriched with one-tenth as much electricity, a boon to the nuclear power industry.</p>
        <p>But after having invested almost $2 billion in the technology, the United States Enrichment Corporation, America's privatized nuclear fuel provider, abandoned the technology last year, saying the method was too expensive to commercialize and would probably always be so.</p>
        <p>With that experience, Washington reacted with alarm to intelligence reports from multiple sources indicating that Iran was trying to buy such technology from Russia.</p>
        <p>That is only the latest point of tension between Russia and the United States in terms of Iran.</p>
        <p>In February, Russia promised to stop making plutonium out of fuel from its civilian power reactors as part of a $100 million joint research and aid package from Washington. The administration put a condition on the part of the package most attractive to Moscow, namely the $25 million for joint research into new reactors. Washington insisted that Russia had to stop all new sales and transfers of nuclear technology to Iran that could be used in a nuclear weapons program.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Adamov, the atomic energy minister, has said since then that Russia would not stop competing to sell light water power reactors to Iran.</p>
        <p>The Russian Foreign Ministry declined to comment today on the dispute. A spokesman for Mr. Adamov said he was traveling and could not answer questions.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Iranian mission to the United Nations said Iran's cooperation with Russia posed ''no threat of proliferation.'' Iran ''does not seek a nuclear weapon and has exercised utmost transparency with regard to its program,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the spokesman added, ''We do not accept any country's deciding in an arbitrary manner what type of peaceful technology we can or cannot have.''</p>
        <p>As a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Iran was ''entitled'' to technology ''for peaceful purposes,'' the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>''If the U.S. has any complaints,'' he added, ''the proper forum is the I.A.E.A.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials said Washington and Moscow would continue talks. Otherwise Washington could decide to reduce the more than $250 million a year that the Energy Department gives Russia to support its hard-pressed nuclear sector and secure its arsenal from theft and accident.</p>
