        <p>FARMINGVILLE: WORKERS BEATEN -- Two migrant workers were attacked with shovels and knives Sunday morning by two men posing as contractors, the police said. Two white men in Farmingville lured the Mexican men into their station wagon with the promise of work. The workers were driven to an abandoned building in Shirley, N.Y., said Detective Sgt. Robert Reecks, of the Suffolk County Police. The workers, Israel Perez and Magdaleno Escamilla, were then beaten with shovels and Mr. Perez was stabbed repeatedly with a knife. They managed to escape and wave down a motorist. Mr. Perez underwent surgery for a severed tendon in his right hand yesterday, and was listed in stable condition at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MAYOR CRITICIZES BRATTON -- Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani warned his former police commissioner, William J. Bratton, left, yesterday to ''stay out of the Republican Party.'' Otherwise, Mr. Giuliani threatened, ''the Republican mayor of New York City will do everything he can to oppose you.'' Mr. Bratton, a registered independent who warred with Mr. Giuliani in the mid-1990's over who should get credit for the city's drop in crime, has been saying he may run for mayor in 2001 as a Republican. The mayor said, ''I think all of the personally nasty things that he's said about me obviously will influence me.'' Mr. Bratton said the mayor's remarks were ''not unanticipated.''</p>

        <p>BRONX: RISE IN EMERGENCY-ROOM VISITS -- An increase in the number of children coming through its emergency room over the last three years has prompted Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx to open a new emergency room, exclusively for children, a year ahead of schedule, officials say. Between 1997 and 1999, children's emergency-room visits rose 27 percent, to 33,247. Hospital officials cite a heavy load of childhood asthma cases and a shortage of primary care doctors' offices in the Bronx as major reasons for the increase.</p>

        <p>QUEENS: BODY FOUND AT SITE OF FIRE -- The body of a 23-year-old woman was discovered inside a two-story house in Queens where a fire broke out early yesterday, the police said. The woman, Tennile Keitt, who lived in the house, at 173-30 113th Avenue, had signs of a blow to the head. The house caught fire at 4:30 a.m., the police said. The fire started in different areas at the same time and the authorities are investigating it as a possible arson, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Andrew McInnis.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: INDICTMENT IN HORSE DEATHS -- A Brooklyn stable fire that killed 21 horses was set by a high school dropout seeking revenge against a former girlfriend whose family kept a horse in the stable, officials said yesterday, announcing a 79-count indictment against the teenager. In previous interviews with investigators, the teenager, Frank Esposito, 17, has said his discarded marijuana cigarette accidentally set the fire that destroyed the Bergen Beach Stables on June 9, police said. But Carl Kruger, a state senator who represents Bergen Beach, said that investigators have concluded the fire began at the stall of the horse owned by the family of the former girlfriend of Mr. Esposito.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: LIEBERMAN SENATE RACE -- Gov. John G. Rowland said yesterday that he would veto any bill calling for a special Senate election in less than two years should Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat, win both the United States Senate and vice-presidential races. Were Mr. Lieberman forced to resign his Senate seat, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, would appoint his replacement. A special election would be held in 2002 to fill the position, but the Legislature could call one before then. Mr. Rowland said yesterday for the first time that a short list of successors would include Representatives Christopher Shays of Bridgeport and Nancy Johnson of New Britain. Both are Republicans.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: CHEMICAL COMPANY PLEADS -- A chemical company in Paterson that leaked a cloud of the pollutant cresol, enveloping a nearby elementary school and sending 53 children and 6 teachers to the hospital in 1998, pleaded guilty to criminal charges yesterday, the State Division of Criminal Justice announced. The company, Heterene Chemical Corporation, agreed to contribute $75,000 to a Paterson hospital after admitting a single count of recklessly creating risk of widespread injury or damage. In exchange for the plea, four other counts against the company and individual charges against its president, David Simpson Dean, 70, of Mahwah, were dropped.</p>

        <p>HACKENSACK: SCHOOL BOARD MEASURE -- A Superior Court judge yesterday approved a November ballot measure that could change the board in the Englewood School District from one that is appointed by the mayor to one that is elected by voters. Englewood is the last town in Bergen County with an appointed school board.</p>

        <p>FREEHOLD: FINANCIER PLEADS NOT GUILTY -- As he had in federal court, the former penny-stock tycoon Robert E. Brennan pleaded not guilty in state court yesterday to bankruptcy fraud charges. No date has been set for a trial in either court, but federal rules make it more likely that the federal case would go first, possibly late this year. During yesterday's hearing, Judge Michael D. Farren of State Superior Court told Mr. Brennan not to expect a state trial before July. Mr. Brennan remains free on bail. Both sets of charges stem from a bankruptcy he declared in 1995, just as he was supposed to pay millions to investors a judge had determined had been cheated by Mr. Brennan.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>UNION CITY: MAYOR'S RECALL URGED -- A campaign to recall the mayor of Union City, Rudy Garcia, began yesterday, when a recall committee officially petitioned the city clerk. The recall committee charges Mr. Garcia with mismanaging the city's finances and helping to cause a projected $12 million deficit in the 2001 fiscal year budget of $70 million. Mr. Garcia estimates the deficit at $5 million and blames political foes for thwarting an attempt to balance the budget by selling a city-owned stadium to the Board of Education.</p>
