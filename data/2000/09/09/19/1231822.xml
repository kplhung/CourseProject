        <p>As he campaigns around the country, Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential nominee, stops in public schools nearly every week to lay out Gov. George W. Bush's education proposals.</p>
        <p>But at the last three such stops, Mr. Cheney has found himself sharply questioned by parents, teachers and students who are concerned that one of Governor Bush's central ideas -- his proposal to withhold federal funds from low-performing schools and give the money directly to parents -- would end up damaging the public school system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney was questioned about the subject last week on a farm in Michigan, at a high school outside Cleveland, and twice at a high school in Marietta, Ohio -- where the editor of the school newspaper wondered what the effect the proposal would have in rural areas, and a teacher worried that charter schools in her state were not being held to the same standards as public schools.</p>
        <p>Today, during a visit to the Stevenson Elementary School here in Bellevue, a suburb about 10 miles east across Lake Washington from downtown Seattle, the public school proposal was the first issue raised when Mr. Cheney ended his short speech and held and question-and-answer session with the audience.</p>
        <p>''My concern,'' said a woman who identified herself as a former public school teacher who now has three children in public schools, ''is for the proposed voucher program, and the money that could conceivably take away from the public schools.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney responded, ''We have not advocated vouchers, per se,'' explaining that the mechanism that parents could use to spend the money would be up to state and local governments to determine.</p>
        <p>''The notion that we are somehow anti-public school is simply not the case,'' he said. ''We want the public schools to work. We want them to be as good as they were when we went to school.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney explained that under the Bush proposal, low-performing schools that failed to improve after three years would lose their federal Title I money -- financing that is allocated to help educate poor and disadvantaged students in public schools -- and that the money would be given directly to the children's parents.</p>
        <p>The parents could then use the money as a subsidy to send their children to a private school or a charter school, or to hire a tutor and send them to another public school.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, has denounced the Bush proposal, saying it would harm public education.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters, Mr. Cheney defended the plan.</p>
        <p>''We're not proposing to take the money away until the school fails,'' he said. ''But if the school fails -- if the school is unable to do what's necessary to provide for the children attending that school -- we think it's important that federal funds not be used to reinforce failure, that instead that there be accountability built into the system.''</p>
