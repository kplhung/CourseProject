        <p>When Gov. George W. Bush initially announced that he wanted to take part in only one of the three debates proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates and two others on individual television networks, he and his senior aides made two central assumptions.</p>

        <p>When Gov. George W. Bush initially announced that he wanted to take part in only one of the three debates proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates and two others on individual television networks, he and his senior aides made two central assumptions.</p>
        <p>One was that voters did not care -- or know -- much about the commission. The other was that news organizations would hold Vice President Al Gore's feet to the fire for having said, in the past, that he would participate in network debates.</p>
        <p>On the first point, it is impossible to know whether Mr. Bush and his aides were right or wrong. But on the second, it is now clear that they made what even they admit was a significant miscalculation.</p>
        <p>By Thursday, less than two weeks after Mr. Bush had staked his original position, he had agreed to the entirety of the three-debate schedule outlined by the commission.</p>
        <p>And several Republican strategists and even a few Republican officials who advise the campaign said that most of what the Bush campaign succeeded in doing over that period of time was making the candidate look halting and nervous.</p>
        <p>''In the end, I don't know that it mattered much,'' said an official with ties to the Bush campaign, adding that voters probably paid little heed to the debate over debates.</p>
        <p>But, the official said, referring to the Bush campaign: ''They overplayed it. There's a thing with public perception that they're still dealing with: Is he deep enough? Is he heavy enough? And every time they go through one of these drills, it looks like they're trying to protect him from something.''</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications for the campaign, said Mr. Bush emerged from the process in a good position. She said that the formats the campaigns agreed to in negotiations on Saturday were more ''free-flowing'' and less ''stilted'' than they would have been had Mr. Bush not pressed his case.</p>
        <p>Janet Brown, executive director of the commission, disputed that assessment, saying that ''the package that's been agreed to is exactly what the commission had hoped for'' and was always among the options.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes also said that the impetus behind the alternate proposal was that ''we were trying to make sure the formats would be different and interesting, that the widest possible audience would watch.''</p>
        <p>''We fully expected the media would help us demand that Vice President Gore live up to his word,'' she said. ''Had the shoes been reversed, I think we would still be talking about why Governor Bush had backed off his word.''</p>
        <p>But Republican officials said that the Bush campaign failed to take several realities into account.</p>
        <p>They said that because of Mr. Gore's reputation as an adept debater, the story line accompanying Mr. Bush's desire for alternate formats was bound to pivot on the question of whether he was trying to minimize the impact of the debates.</p>
        <p>And that question, they said, was fueled by the nature of the Bush plan.  The commission had proposed 90-minute debates that would be broadcast by all the television networks; Mr. Bush had proposed 60-minute sessions likely to be shown only by the network sponsoring them.</p>
        <p>It looked, said one strategist who occasionally advises the campaign, like a dodge. ''You can't take sulfuric acid and put it in a nice Tiffany box and say it's drinking water,'' the adviser said.</p>
        <p>Other advisers said that the Bush campaign believed that it could successfully use the debate over debates to press the charge that Mr. Gore did not live up to his word.</p>
        <p>After all, the campaign released snippets of videotape in which Mr. Gore emphatically said he wanted to debate Mr. Bush on the network news programs that Mr. Bush was suggesting. Several advisers said that they thought it would be a strong opening salvo as the campaign entered the newly intense phase after Labor Day and sought to halt the momentum Mr. Gore was carrying out of his convention.</p>
        <p>''It was just clear that the vice president did pretty well in the first week or two after the convention and there needed to be a strategic offensive,'' said Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman who serves as an informal campaign adviser.</p>
        <p>''This was one way of taking control for a moment and forcing the vice president to respond,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But, as other advisers conceded, the strategy backfired. ''They didn't get that the story line about Bush was already set: you're a scaredy- cat,'' one adviser said.</p>
        <p>So when the Gore campaign declined the network debates, saying that his agreement to do them had been predicated on doing the three commission debates for starters, few news accounts or editorials quibbled with his position.</p>
        <p>The degree to which the Bush campaign expected and counted on a different reaction from news organizations was reflected in its release, following Mr. Bush's initial announcement, of a commercial that used the snippets of videotape to accuse Mr. Gore of double-speak.</p>
        <p>The commercial was released in a handful of markets, with the main goal being to generate more news coverage of Mr. Bush's position.</p>
        <p>Several Bush advisers said they began discussing alternate formats even before the party conventions. By the Labor Day weekend, they said, there was a consensus between the candidate and his aides.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people thought it was a very good strategy,'' Ms. Hughes said, alluding to some of the subsequent second-guessing by Republicans outside of Austin. ''I would say a number of people whose ZIP code is Washington, D.C.''</p>
        <p>The strategy was motivated by several factors, advisers said. A few said that its principal proponent was Mr. Bush, who they said inherited from his father a general dislike of the commission, a feeling that it tried to dictate terms to candidates and that its formats did not flatter President Bush in 1992. Other advisers disputed that contention.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Bush's aides felt at the time that the public did not care who sponsored the debates. ''We're not stupid,'' one adviser said several weeks ago. ''We've been looking at this. Nobody knows who the commission is.''</p>
        <p>Several said they and Mr. Bush believed that the debates would be better suited to him if they were conversational and informal, and they thought that because they were proposing an early debate to be moderated on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' by Tim Russert, a widely respected interviewer, reporters would not see their position as a timid one.</p>
        <p>But several Republican strategists said that the Bush campaign did not realize that during a period in which Mr. Gore's poll numbers were rising, much of what Mr. Bush did was bound to be interpreted as defensive.</p>
        <p>One Republican strategist said that beyond the pounding in the news media that the Bush campaign suffered over the course of this, it had also inadvertently strengthened the commission's hand in the future, by first objecting to its power and control and then seeming to surrender.</p>
        <p>''That's the terrible-ness of this,'' said the strategist. ''The commission is now a beast that lives on.''</p>
