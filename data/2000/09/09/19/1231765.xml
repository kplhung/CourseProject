        <p>''Let's go to Salvador!'' Daniela Mercury exhorted from the stage of the Roxy on Thursday night. Ms. Mercury has made herself the pop ambassador of Salvador, the capital of Bahia, Brazil.

        <p>Salvador was once the primary New World port for the African slave trade. Now it's the heart of Afro-Brazilian culture.

        <p>''Let's go to Salvador!'' Daniela Mercury exhorted from the stage of the Roxy on Thursday night. Ms. Mercury has made herself the pop ambassador of Salvador, the capital of Bahia, Brazil. At the Roxy she praised her hometown in song after song and danced herself into a sweat to bring the exhilaration of Bahian carnival into a New York club.</p>
        <p>Salvador was once the primary New World port for the African slave trade. Now it's the heart of Afro-Brazilian culture. During its carnival, bands on sound trucks, known as trios eletricos, play galloping axe dance tunes, and neighborhood groups called blocos afros muster dozens of drummers and parade to Bahia's own sambareggae beat. Ms. Mercury's songs draw on both sambareggae and axe, and they celebrate the power of music to free people from personal woes and societal pressures.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mercury chooses her songs from Bahia's leading songwriters, including Caetano Veloso and Carlinhos Brown; she also writes a few herself. Most are frisky, uptempo tunes, and she sang them with nonchalant precision, sometimes delivering high notes like a girlish trumpet. Just when it seemed Ms. Mercury was limiting herself to catchy dance tunes, she sang Mr. Veloso's pensive ''Sou Voce,'' handling its chromatic complexities with breathy grace.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Mercury looks like a Euro-Brazilian, she chooses songs that pointedly praise Bahia's black culture; one describes the Afrocentric bloco afro Ile-Aiye as a ''perola negra'' (''black pearl''). Yet for all her local pride, Ms. Mercury is far from provincial. The title song of her current album, ''Sol da Liberdade'' (BMG), praised music from across Brazil, and ''Itapua @no 2000'' was a rap in praise of modernity, complete with a funk horn section.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mercury's own song ''Dara'' invoked the West African pantheon of Yoruba deities, and it was laced with Alexandre Vargas's pealing, trickle-down African-style guitar lines. Angelique Kidjo, the singer from Benin who sings Yoruba lyrics on the album, also joined Ms. Mercury on stage at the Roxy, where the rough grain of her voice set off Ms. Mercury's tuneful clarity.</p>
        <p>Constantly in motion, Ms. Mercury made the song-and-dance troupers of MTV look like slackers. There was no lip-synching for her in a set full of uptempo songs, and barely a pause for breath; she hit every note while she pumped her arms, strutted and kicked through synchronized steps with her dancers and backup singers.</p>
        <p>At one point she got the willing audience to mimic her moves, showing them a routine as if she were a samba-aerobics instructor, and later directed the whole audience to move from left to right, then from front to back. With her megawatt smile, Ms. Mercury shared what one of her songs, ''Musica de Rua'' (''Street Music''), demands: ''Alegria agora'' (''Joy now'').</p>
