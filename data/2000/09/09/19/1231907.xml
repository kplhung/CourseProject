        <p>The Atlanta Braves are the team the Mets talked about after the breathless end to last season, the team they discussed at the hopeful start of this season and the team that has stayed above them and on their minds during this familiar season. Actually, the Braves have hovered over the Mets, tweaking them here and teasing them there, for the last decade.</p>
        <p>Nothing changed from this recurring theme since it took the Braves three innings to show why they were vastly superior to the Mets on this night. While the Braves were making daring plays and whacking liners over and off Mike Hampton, the Mets were mesmerized by Greg Maddux and seemed listless in a game they desperately needed before succumbing, 6-3.</p>
        <p>When the Mets play the Braves, the results are usually the same. The Braves win, the Mets lose and the questions about whether the Mets will ever gain superiority linger. The Mets needed to begin harassing the Braves in the first of six games in the next 11 days so they would not feel as queasy as they do at Turner Field and so they might even unnerve Atlanta.</p>
        <p>It never happened. After Manager Bobby Valentine spent 20 minutes trying to explain why this series would not have an impact on next week's series in New York and would not influence a potential meeting in the postseason, the Mets played the sort of game that made their malaise against the Braves seem more pronounced.</p>
        <p>There was Maddux dominating the Mets for seven innings and there was John Rocker doing his crazed dash in from the bullpen to collect the final four outs and strand  three. This defeat sure looked frustrating enough to carry over. The Mets have now lost 19 of their last 21 games at Turner, including three of four this season.</p>
        <p>''We're not trying to do anything more than win this game,'' Valentine said before the game. ''There's no trophy, no glory and no aftereffect that could be gotten by a win, in my opinion.''</p>
        <p>That is what Valentine has to say because the Mets would feel additional pressure if he hyped these games and the Braves swept them. But, sometimes, it sounds as if the Mets are content to finish second, grab the wild-card berth and then somehow show they can stifle Atlanta if the teams meet in the postseason. Why should anyone believe that the Mets could defeat the Braves in October if they cannot do it regularly now? When Robin Ventura was asked if the Mets absolutely had to win last night's game against Atlanta, he embellished the thought.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, they're all that way,'' Ventura said. ''I don't think anybody thinks it's the end of the season. But, obviously, to catch them, we've got to start right away. It's hard to do.''</p>
        <p>An optimistic Mike Piazza said before the game, ''We want to look like a playoff team and go again.''</p>
        <p>Then the Mets need to regroup and try to look that way tonight. They made two glaring mistakes while the Braves made two gorgeous plays in the first three innings, one of the differences in the game. When Andres Galarraga tried moving from second to third on a grounder to shortstop, Mike Bordick could not pull the ball out of his glove so he threw to first.</p>
        <p>That proved pivotal as Walt Weiss followed with a squeeze bunt. Hampton burst forward to field it and had an excellent chance to get Galarraga, but his off-balance throw sailed off Piazza's glove. Those misplays were in contrast to a gorgeous putout that Galarraga and Maddux combined to make and a nifty play by second baseman Rafael Furcal.</p>
        <p>Hampton was bruised for three hits and one liner off his right wrist in the third as the Braves dumped the Mets in a 4-0 ditch. Even Hampton conceded the Mets were basically done then because of Maddux, who extended his scoreless streak to 29 1/3 innings.</p>
        <p>Sure, it is easy for the Mets to focus on their lead over the Diamondbacks for the wild-card berth and easy for them to claim that the next five games with the Braves will not solely dictate the outcome of their season. Unless the Mets have another September collapse, which started when the Braves swept them last year, they should qualify for the postseason.</p>
        <p>It is sensible to think about the wild card, but proving something now is important, too. The Mets crawled into first place in the National League East for two days three weeks ago and have not been back since. It would have given the Mets a mental boost and perhaps frazzled the Braves if the Mets could have roared into the top spot again. Since they trail by four games with 12 left and since they rarely win here, that is doubtful.</p>
        <p>Whether it is for achieving home-field advantage by winning the division in September or to advance to the World Series in October, the Mets eventually have to stop the Braves to make one of these aching seasons feel different. The Mets could have started by stifling the Braves last night, but, instead, they look as if they will be talking about chasing Atlanta for a while.</p>
        <p>''One of these days,'' Edgardo Alfonzo said, ''it's going to turn around.''</p>
