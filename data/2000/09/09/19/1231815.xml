        <p>Oil prices surged yesterday to their highest levels in a decade, on fears that rising tensions between Iraq and Kuwait would disrupt the flow of crude oil from the Persian Gulf at a time when petroleum supplies around the world are extremely tight.</p>
        <p>The cost of crude for delivery in October increased 96 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $36.88 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange, the steepest price for oil since the Persian Gulf War. In London, the price of Brent crude oil for delivery in November also reached a 10-year peak, rising 99 cents, to $34.97 a barrel.</p>
        <p>Oil prices have hovered near 10-year highs all month in the United States, largely because of growing concern about lower-than-usual supplies of crude oil and home heating fuel. Consequently, possible threats to the supply of oil easily spark increases in crude prices.</p>
        <p>Traders seemed to be reacting to the last week's increasingly belligerent talk from Iraq about Kuwait's new oil projects. Iraq has accused Kuwait, which it once invaded and which it considers a puppet of the United States, of authorizing projects close to their mutual border that would permit Kuwait to tap oil deposits in Iraq. On Sunday, Saddam Hussein, the leader of Iraq, warned that ''the superpowers will fasten their grip on oil-producing countries,'' according to the Iraqi press. Speaking at a cabinet meeting, he reportedly urged fellow members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to resist such pressure from the United States and Europe.</p>
        <p>The United States responded with tough talk of its own, as Defense Secretary William S. Cohen warned Iraq not to take ''any kind of aggressive action'' against its neighbors. The dispute involving Iraq, Kuwait and the United States has stirred worries within the American oil market that another conflict in the Persian Gulf might limit oil supplies for winter, when they are needed the most worldwide.</p>
        <p>But some analysts said Iraq's bellicosity masks a different threat to Middle Eastern oil exports. Rather than invade Kuwait again, Iraq has implied that it is willing to reduce or halt oil exports to apply pressure on the United Nations on the eve of a critical discussion about reparations Iraq must make to Kuwait, said Raad Alkadiri of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting group based in Washington. Iraq exports about 2.3 million barrels a day, or about 4 percent of the world's daily consumption.</p>
        <p>A United Nations commission on reparations will meet later this month to settle a $15.9 billion claim brought against Iraq by Kuwait. Iraq is slowly rebuilding its economy from the proceeds of moderate sales of oil permitted by United Nations sanctions. According to the Iraqi mission at the United Nations, the crude exports have brought in $31.6 billion since 1996, $9.5 billion of which has gone into a compensation account.</p>
        <p>Analysts said Iraq was incensed at the idea of paying such large reparations to Kuwait. Moreover, Iraq fears that if this claim is successful, it will open the gates to others that would collectively ruin the country's economy and Mr. Hussein's regime.</p>
        <p>''The votes are there'' to compel Iraq to pay $15.9 billion to Kuwait, Mr. Alkadiri said. ''So Iraq could suspend oil shipments to pressure the U.N.'' Iraq would be very upset to see a large amount of its revenues go to Kuwait, he said.</p>
