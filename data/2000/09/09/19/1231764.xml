        <p>Majesty  Not one but two exhibitions celebrating the British-born Philadelphia artist Thomas Sully (1783-1872) open today at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''Queen Victoria and Thomas Sully'' focuses on his masterpiece, a portrait of Queen Victoria at 18 that brought him prominence. The show, until Dec. 31, documents the creation of the portrait through more than 30 works -- oil sketches, paintings, drawings, manuscripts and ephemera -- that shed fresh light on the image of Victoria in the year of her coronation and commemorate the centennial of her death, in 1901. The second exhibition, ''Thomas Sully in the Metropolitan,'' until Jan. 7, taps the museum's collection for some 30 paintings and drawings from Sully's heyday, 1810 through the 1840's.</p>

        <p>Majesty  Not one but two exhibitions celebrating the British-born Philadelphia artist Thomas Sully (1783-1872) open today at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''Queen Victoria and Thomas Sully'' focuses on his masterpiece, a portrait of Queen Victoria at 18 that brought him prominence. The show, until Dec. 31, documents the creation of the portrait through more than 30 works -- oil sketches, paintings, drawings, manuscripts and ephemera -- that shed fresh light on the image of Victoria in the year of her coronation and commemorate the centennial of her death, in 1901. The second exhibition, ''Thomas Sully in the Metropolitan,'' until Jan. 7, taps the museum's collection for some 30 paintings and drawings from Sully's heyday, 1810 through the 1840's.</p>
        <p>Taste Makers  The roster of artists includes Thomas Cole, Winslow Homer, Francis David Millet, John Singer Sargent, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, Thomas Eakins and John Sloan. Powerful images by all go on view beginning tomorrow at the National Academy of Design, Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, in an exhibition billed as the first comprehensive historical examination of American art criticism. ''Rave Reviews: American Art and Its Critics, 1826-1925,'' through Dec. 31, highlights reaction to debuts in the academy's annual exhibitions, which encouraged the exploration of new subjects.</p>
        <p>Coming Attractions  Obsession is the focus of the 11-part Tuesday film series that begins the 2000-2001 season at 7 tonight at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street. With attractions like the opening double feature of Erich von Stroheim's ''Greed'' (1924) and John Huston's ''Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' (1948), ''Empires of Passion: The Cinema of Obsession'' examines lust, avarice, compulsion and death in films from the 1920's through the 90's.</p>
        <p>English History  A black actor has been cast as an English monarch for the first time by the Royal Shakespeare Company. David Oyewolo, 24, is to play the title role in the company's production of Parts I, II and III of ''Henry VI.'' The production opens in November in Stratford-on-Avon and moves to London in April.</p>
        <p>Outbreak of Hostilities  Mold menaces China's 2,200-year-old army of terra cotta warriors. The China Daily reports that 1,400 of the 8,000 life-size statues discovered in the early 1970's in the tomb of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, have been attacked so far. A contract has been signed with a Belgian pharmaceutical concern to combat the problem.</p>
