        <p>Shares of Allaire, which makes software that lets companies tailor Web site content for electronic commerce, fell sharply yesterday after the company said sales of its core product would fall far short of expectations. For the third quarter ending Sept. 30, the company now expects revenue of $28 million to $32 million, compared with $33.3 million in the second quarter and $15.1 million in the third quarter of last year. The company expects a net loss of 5 cents to 20 cents a share in the third quarter, in contrast to net income of 6 cents a share in the second quarter and a net loss of a penny a share in the third quarter of 1999. Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had predicted earnings of 7 cents a share for the third quarter. Allaire's stock closed down $7.06, or 40 percent, to $10.44, just off its 52-week low and well off the 52-week high of $94.12 it reached in March.</p>
