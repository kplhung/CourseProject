        <p>Martha Bell remembers bursting into tears when the Board of Regents voted to allow the City University of New York to end remedial instruction for bachelor's degree students.</p>
        <p>Such instruction was at the heart of the program for poor students known as SEEK that CUNY started two generations ago to give black and Hispanic students a chance at a college education they could not get under the admission criteria, at a time CUNY was almost entirely white.</p>
        <p>''That's the end of SEEK,'' Dr. Bell, who runs Brooklyn College's branch of the program, remembers thinking. ''I went round and round on how could we provide the experiences our students desperately need. I thought about retiring. My gut reaction that day was to close up.''</p>
        <p>She did not resign, nor did her program close up. Instead, after battles on campus and appeals to state legislators and an overhaul of the curriculum, the program has emerged with a new and tougher look. Rather than effectively ending SEEK (which stands for Search for Elevation, Education and Knowledge), the ban on remedial instruction has given the program a new life, when its very reason for being seemed unclear in a university at which more than half of CUNY's students are black or Hispanic, and many are poor and academically unprepared.</p>
        <p>As CUNY again tightens admissions to its senior colleges, the program has once again become a way onto campus for poor students who cannot demonstrate their readiness for college-level work.</p>
        <p>''We have become the only opportunity in town,'' Dr. Bell said. ''It brings us closer to our original mission of providing access where there wouldn't be any.''</p>
        <p>What she has done to get around CUNY's ban on remedial instruction is to provide students at Brooklyn, one of the 11 senior college campuses where the program for poor students is offered, with a longer and more intense summer session and more challenging courses for the fall.</p>
        <p>In one reading class in August, Nancy Vighetti introduced students to Sophocles' ''Antigone.'' For many, it was strange territory. They stumbled over unfamiliar names (like Eteocles and Polynices, Antigone's brothers), unfamiliar words (like carrion birds that eat dead flesh) and unfamiliar concepts (like stoning someone to death). ''They still stone people to death in parts of the world today,'' Ms. Vighetti said.</p>
        <p>The summer session was an academic boot camp that covered many skills the students never picked up in high school. Ms. Vighetti lectured to the students just so they would learn to take notes. She made them keep journals so they would get used to writing.</p>
        <p>''In high school, I never read a book, but I had good grades,'' said Gisele Melendez, an 18-year-old with long pink fingernails from Sheepshead Bay. Referring to Sheepshead Bay High School, she said: ''They asked you questions, but questions they answered in class. Here, I have to read the book to have my own ideas.''</p>
        <p>Many professors prefer to deal with the academically elite, but Ms. Vighetti is one of the corps within CUNY that finds rewards in working with the poorly prepared.</p>
        <p>''At a certain point, you can see the light bulbs go on,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Historically, SEEK students were unable to meet the university's standards for entering freshmen when they were admitted, and many were still unable to meet those requirements after a summer of intensive remedial instruction. In previous years, they would simply have taken some additional remedial work without credit in fall and spring semesters.</p>
        <p>But the university's new policy said the senior colleges could offer no remedial courses during the regular school year, only tutoring or workshops. To meet the new policy, Dr. Bell shifted more math into the summer because, she said, ''There was no way to say that arithmetic and algebra were college-level math.''</p>
        <p>For university students still weak in reading or writing, the main solution was to put them into compensatory courses that covered college-level texts but more slowly, with more hours of class per week, than regular classes, for the same number of credits.</p>
        <p>Learning to read analytically and develop ideas are central themes in Brooklyn College's program. Dr. Bell has developed a remedial program at Brooklyn that has drawn more than $1 million in federal grants and is a model for about a dozen other public and private university campuses.</p>
        <p>More than 360 new freshmen entered Brooklyn this fall through the program, roughly double the number last year and more than a quarter of the college's freshman class. (Across CUNY, the number of freshmen in the program rose 1.5 percent, to 2,368, or 17 percent of the freshmen entering the 11 senior colleges.)</p>
        <p>To qualify, students must meet criteria for being both economically and educationally disadvantaged. At Brooklyn this year, the average total SAT score for such students was 790, well below the 1,060 average for the freshman class. More than 90 percent of the students came from families with annual incomes below $20,000.</p>
        <p>Last year, about 44 percent of the university's SEEK students were Hispanic, 30 percent black, 15 percent Asian and 12 percent white.</p>
        <p>Besides free tutoring and counseling throughout college, these students receive $250 a semester to help pay for their books, and their fees are waived. The students are also allowed 10 semesters of financial aid, compared with 8 for other students.</p>
        <p>Herman Badillo, the university's chairman, said he had supported the program when it was created in the mid-1960's under an act of the Legislature, several years before open admissions began. But, he added, ''I have a sense that it has been a big problem and that it has not been implemented as I intended.'' Still, he said, he did not intend to shut it down.</p>
        <p>One criticism is that students in the program have always graduated at lower rates than other students. According to the most recent data available, 26 percent of students who entered it in 1991 earned a CUNY bachelor's degree within eight years, compared with 44 percent for non-SEEK students. Supporters assert  that is because students in the program have started farther behind educationally.</p>
        <p>At the Brooklyn program, the students' academic success rates have risen since 1995, when Dr. Bell began to overhaul her program. In 1998, 99 percent of Brooklyn's SEEK students passed the university's proficiency tests in reading and mathematics within a year, up from 84 percent four years earlier. Similarly, 93 percent of these students passed the core curriculum courses they took as freshmen in 1998, up from 72 percent four years earlier.</p>
        <p>Although the CUNY colleges have begun to receive stronger students since 1995, as they raise their entrance requirements, Dr. Bell said the educational preparation of the SEEK students had not changed significantly in that period.</p>
        <p>Still, the program's reputation as a haven for less prepared students has frightened some families away.</p>
        <p>''Some parents call and say they don't want their children in the program because they will be stigmatized,'' said Nancy Jean-Baptiste, a Brooklyn graduate who was a counselor in the program this summer.</p>
        <p>Margarita Eguizabal, a 28-year-old graduate from El Salvador, said many students thought that students in the program were allowed to take easier courses. ''They think that SEEK students are getting a free ride, but that's not true,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For most of the students, the starting point is the upgraded summer immersion program. Since 1995, the university has required all SEEK students to attend summer classes. But Dr. Bell now offers them three  summer sessions totaling 11 weeks, and many of them attend at least two.</p>
        <p>Christine Kessler, who taught Extreme Writing this summer, hoped to demystify essay writing so her 22 students could pass CUNY's essay exam. On the first day of class, she gave them a quick diagnostic spelling test of 50 words followed by tips for improving their spelling.</p>
        <p>She was not surprised that many did poorly. The class was like a mini-United Nations. The 22 students came from 15 countries, including Russia, China, the Dominican Republic, Turkey, Nigeria and Haiti.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kessler introduced them to mnemonics -- memory aids -- and urged them to look for rhymes, acronyms, pictures and songs to help them remember. Acknowledge, she showed them, was easy if they remembered ''the A.C. (air-conditioner) you KNOW goes on the LEDGE.'' Believe is simple, too, she said, if they remembered ''never beLIEve a LIE.''</p>
        <p>''This is the way students in schools across the United States learn to remember information,'' she assured them. ''The next time you go to your doctors, ask them how they remember the bones in the arm.''</p>
        <p>In another class, Margaret M. Waters was also starting with basics, even though her students had already passed all of the university's entrance exams. While the students did not need remedial work, she wanted to introduce them to the kind of analytical thinking they would be required to do in September.</p>
        <p>The starting text was ''Jack and the Beanstalk.'' Unlike ''Antigone''  (which they would get to later), there was nothing unfamiliar about the story. But, as Professor Waters showed them, it was a parable with layers of meaning, and she hoped to give them tools they could use to tackle more complex material later.</p>
        <p>''Does Jack plan to steal?'' she asked. ''Is Jack a thief? Or an opportunist?''</p>
        <p>One student jumped in with a theory: ''All he wanted to do was to make his mother happy. He feels he let her down.''</p>
        <p>Professor Waters pressed him, ''I think you're nicer than I would be.''</p>
        <p>She read from the text about how Jack was sitting in the attic and suffering. ''He was thinking of himself,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Yeah,'' the student acknowledged. ''He was thinking of himself.''</p>
        <p>A student near the door embroidered the thought. ''He just got plain greedy.''</p>
        <p>Soon, they were deep into deconstructing text.</p>
        <p>By the end of the summer, 150 of the students had still not passed all of the university's entrance requirements, and will receive extra support through workshops and tutoring.</p>
        <p>But even the 215 who were ready to plunge into regular freshmen courses, including freshman English and mathematics, will continue to be watched over closely. They will take two of their freshman courses and a counseling seminar together, and Dr. Bell and her colleagues will provide extra support.</p>
        <p>''I don't have a magic pill,'' Dr. Bell said. ''If students come in needing reading and writing and maybe math, they can't learn it all overnight.''</p>
