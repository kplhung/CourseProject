        <p>After a wave of mass street demonstrations and diplomatic protests failed to persuade Alberto Fujimori to call new presidential elections in Peru, palace intrigue has apparently caused his fall. The manner of Mr. Fujimori's demise is fitting, for the aide who helped keep him in power -- Vladimiro Montesinos, the chief of Peru's intelligence police -- seems to have played a central if unintended role in the president's decision to call new elections and renounce his own candidacy. This happened over the weekend after a Peruvian television channel broadcast a videotape that apparently showed Mr. Montesinos bribing a member of Parliament.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos is the president's chief adviser and fixer. It is not clear how the videotape got out, and why it led to the president's announcement. Peruvians speculate that Mr. Montesinos could not be fired because he has compromising information about the president, and that Mr. Fujimori could not hold onto power without him.</p>

        <p>After a wave of mass street demonstrations and diplomatic protests failed to persuade Alberto Fujimori to call new presidential elections in Peru, palace intrigue has apparently caused his fall. The manner of Mr. Fujimori's demise is fitting, for the aide who helped keep him in power -- Vladimiro Montesinos, the chief of Peru's intelligence police -- seems to have played a central if unintended role in the president's decision to call new elections and renounce his own candidacy. This happened over the weekend after a Peruvian television channel broadcast a videotape that apparently showed Mr. Montesinos bribing a member of Parliament.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos is the president's chief adviser and fixer. It is not clear how the videotape got out, and why it led to the president's announcement. Peruvians speculate that Mr. Montesinos could not be fired because he has compromising information about the president, and that Mr. Fujimori could not hold onto power without him.</p>
        <p>There is nothing murky, however, about what must happen now. New elections should be held within weeks, supervised and monitored by the Organization of American States. Opposition politicians in Peru face pressure to grant amnesty to Mr. Fujimori and his top officials if they return to private life. This would only allow the rot inside Peru's government and security forces to continue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos, in particular, has managed to quash various investigations of his behavior. He was expelled from the army in 1977 on charges of selling secrets to the Central Intelligence Agency. He then became a lawyer for drug traffickers. He became Mr. Fujimori's attorney, and got prosecutors to drop charges of tax evasion.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Fujimori was elected president, Mr. Montesinos quickly became his chief adviser and took charge of Mr. Fujimori's contacts with and appointments of military officers. Peruvian and American human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch accuse him of creating death squads. He is widely believed to have instigated Mr. Fujimori's 1992 assumption of dictatorial powers, and newspapers published evidence this year linking him to dirty tricks against opposition candidates.</p>
        <p>Peru's opposition and the O.A.S. have made Mr. Montesinos' removal a top priority, but the Clinton administration has still not settled a long internal debate about how to treat him. America's anti-drug chief, Barry McCaffrey, praised the effectiveness of the intelligence police's drug-fighting work in a visit to Lima in 1996, and a small program of aid to the unit was ended only last year. There were conflicting reports yesterday as to whether Mr. Montesinos had been detained. His supporters in the army should allow his long-overdue arrest, and it is also time for the free elections that President Fujimori so arrogantly blocked earlier this year.</p>
