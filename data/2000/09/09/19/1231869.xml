        <p>PATRICK J. BUCHANAN</p>
        <p>Remarks at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C., as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>''God and the Ten Commandments and school prayer have all been expelled from the public schools. Christmas carols are out, Christian holidays are out.

        <p>My friends, this to me is one of the great issues, now that the cold war is over, and it is whether America is going to remain forever independent and free, with liberty and justice in this country, as determined by us, Americans. Or whether this decision-making authority is going to go back to the United Nations and leave this country, and that is where a number of elitists want to take us. Let me tell you what I would do if I'm elected president. I will get the United States out of the World Trade Organization. I will get the United States out of the International Monetary Fund, and I will tell Kofi Annan, up at the U.N.: ''Sir, your lease on Turtle Bay has run out. We want the United Nations out of the United States by year's end. And if you're having trouble leaving, we'll send up 10,000 marines to help you pack.''</p>
