        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Sept. 15 front-page article about the Board of Regents' plan to entice retired teachers back to the classroom: Every school year brings a new theory of education. These are mandated changes that range from the petty (how desks must be arranged) to the only method that teachers may use to teach.</p>
        <p>When experienced teachers express reservations about the untested educational theory du jour, their concerns are disparaged as an unwillingness to try new things.</p>

        <p>Re your Sept. 15 front-page article about the Board of Regents' plan to entice retired teachers back to the classroom: Every school year brings a new theory of education. These are mandated changes that range from the petty (how desks must be arranged) to the only method that teachers may use to teach.</p>
        <p>When experienced teachers express reservations about the untested educational theory du jour, their concerns are disparaged as an unwillingness to try new things.</p>
        <p>This combination of the rush to embrace educational fads and the contempt for experience is why few retired teachers will wish to return to teaching. These attitudes will also have an effect on the type of people that Harold O. Levy, the schools chancellor, wishes to bring into teaching. The best and the brightest will not stay in an oppressive cookie-cutter system.</p>
