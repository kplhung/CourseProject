        <p>In one case, a woman's illness appeared to stem from an adverse reaction to medicine, not tainted bottled water. A child who complained that water made him sick was described by his parents as having ''a fertile imagination.'' In a third incident, a Brooklyn woman who complained of a sore throat after drinking Poland Spring was found to have a cold sore in her mouth.</p>
        <p>Calls were made to the authorities in the last few days about each of these incidents.</p>
        <p>But even as the number of cases under investigation in New York City and surrounding counties rose to 45 yesterday, investigators said there was nothing to suggest that they were linked or that the region's supplies of bottled water had been beset by widespread tampering.</p>
        <p>They said that none of the bottles tested so far had shown any evidence of covert tampering, like needle holes, and that many of the complainants had no obvious injuries. Furthermore, investigators said the suspect water had come from too many different suppliers or companies to support any kind of pattern.</p>
        <p>''There is no big conspiracy to poison New Yorkers,'' said Inspector Joseph Reznick, the police commander coordinating the city investigation. ''It just doesn't exist.''</p>
        <p>Instead, investigators said, the preliminary theory is that in a few isolated cases, water bottles or glasses might have been mistakenly used to store cleaning agents and then somehow fallen into consumers' hands. Those cases have now been eclipsed, officials said, by dozens in which people have mistakenly blamed bottled water for what ails them or have pretended to be ill.</p>
        <p>''In either event, whether it was a hoax or whether it was real, we seek to find the answers,'' Inspector Reznick said.</p>
        <p>The investigation, which has been named Operation Aqua, is being conducted jointly by several dozen detectives from the Major Case Squad and more than a dozen F.B.I. agents from a unit that specializes in product-tampering incidents. The investigators are removing water that might be tainted from store shelves and are interviewing people who complain of illness and their doctors, as well as store owners and water producers and suppliers.</p>
        <p>In most cases, they have been able to recover the bottles in question and have forwarded them to a United States Food and Drug Administration laboratory in Brooklyn for testing. Although the city did some testing in its own laboratories, federal labs are better at quickly analyzing a water sample for a broad spectrum of contaminants, officials said.</p>
        <p>State health officials said there had been 35 reported cases of tainted water in the city, including three new ones yesterday, and another 10 in Nassau, Suffolk, Dutchess and Rockland Counties. In 18 of the city cases, police officials said the people either declined medical attention or did not demonstrate symptoms consistent with tainted water.</p>
        <p>''We're not disputing that people didn't feel ill,'' Inspector Reznick said. But in many cases, he said, people were ignoring other factors that might have made them sick.</p>
        <p>He cited the case of a 43-year-old Brooklyn woman who reported a sore throat after drinking a bottle of Poland Spring. Investigators do not believe it is a tampering case, because the woman's sister drank from the same bottle without incident, and doctors at Jamaica Hospital found a cold sore in the woman's mouth.</p>
        <p>In 27 reported cases, investigators have retrieved the bottle or a water sample for testing. In the 8 completed tests, 4 samples were negative for contaminants and 4, positive.</p>
        <p>The four positive cases have all been previously reported. Three were the initial incidents that occurred between Aug. 3 and Sept. 6, prompting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to announce the city's inquiry.</p>
        <p>In two of those cases, investigators found traces of ammonia in bottles of water that people believed had been sealed when they bought them from Manhattan stores. But investigators said they were still pursuing a theory that one or both of the bottles may have been accidentally used to store cleaning fluids by someone who handled them after they left the factory.</p>
        <p>In a third instance, traces of a lye-type cleaning agent were found in Perrier water poured at a Midtown Benihana restaurant. Investigators said they thought that the contaminant came from the glass it was served in, not the original bottle. A worker at the restaurant said that no one could comment until the manager returned in a few days.</p>
        <p>In the fourth case, the police said they found bleach in a bottle of Aquafina water bought by a man in a Bronx service station. But officials have questioned the man's account because doctors did not find the sort of injuries to be expected in a man who had consumed bleach.</p>
        <p>Aquafina, Perrier and Poland Spring are three of seven brands of water that have been named by people who say they became ill. Investigators have yet to discover any problems with the way those brands were processed in their factories.</p>
        <p>Poland Spring, in fact, which has been named in 25 incidents, has turned over a series of quality control reports to federal food and drug investigators to demonstrate that there have been no irregularities, according to Jane Lazgin, a spokeswoman for the Perrier Group of America, its parent company. ''The company has also tested our own retained samples to confirm there is no problem,'' Ms. Lazgin said.</p>
        <p>The city Health Department receives about 700 reports of contaminated food or beverages a year, officials said. The Suffolk County Health Department receives about 20 to 30 complaints a year about bottled water, said Paul Ponturo, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>One recent complaint was resolved, Mr. Ponturo said, when investigators found that a mothball smell in bottled water stemmed from the fact that the homeowner had stored the bottle alongside mothballs. ''If you had gotten that kind of complaint in the current environment,'' he said, ''the question would arise, 'Is someone throwing mothballs in the water?' ''</p>
