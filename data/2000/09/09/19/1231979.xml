        <p>A victory in the playoffs after four years can do wonders for a team. It has certainly put the MetroStars in high spirits for Game 2 of their playoff series against the Burn tomorrow night in Dallas.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars, who won in overtime, 2-1, in Game 1 on Friday night, can win their first playoff series by defeating Dallas. That would put them in the Major League Soccer semifinals. Game 3, if necessary, will be Saturday afternoon at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J.</p>
        <p>''We had a very good training session,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano said after practice yesterday, ''and we're anxiously awaiting the next game. Our spirits are high.''</p>
        <p>Except for goalkeeper Mike Ammann and defender Daniel Hernandez, both out for the season with injuries, and goalkeeper Tim Howard, who is with the United States Olympic team in Australia, the rest of the MetroStars will travel to Dallas after practice today.</p>
        <p>Thomas Dooley, who missed Game 1, practiced and may play in Game 2. Zambrano said he planned to change little from Game 1 and that he would speak with Dooley about the length of his playing time.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars, if they were to advance, would meet the winner of the Chicago-New England series, which could be settled tonight. New England will play host to Chicago, a 2-1 victor in Game 1 of that series. The league announced yesterday that it had fined Chicago's Ante Razov and New England's Johnny Torres $250 each for violent conduct in that physical game.</p>
        <p>Kansas City and Los Angeles won the opening games of their series against Colorado and Tampa Bay and could clinch tomorrow night. The Wizards, 1-0 winners in Game 1, travel to Denver. The Galaxy, a 1-0 winner, will play host to Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>UNITED STATES</p>
        <p>The American federation is apparently still investigating a way to make an appeal to FIFA, the world governing body, regarding last week's three-game suspension of Bruce Arena, the coach of the World Cup team.</p>
        <p>Arena and Claudio Reyna, team captain, engaged in a vehement argument with the Jamaican referee after a 2-1 loss in Costa Rica in a World Cup qualifying game</p>
        <p>July 23. Reyna was suspended for two games, which means he will miss the return match against Costa Rica on Oct. 11 and the game at Barbados on Nov. 15.</p>
        <p>The Americans need at least one victory from the two games to advance to the finals in the region, which will will be represented by three teams in the 2002 World Cup.</p>
        <p>From his home in Virginia, Arena refused to comment yesterday about the deadline for an appeal, which was last Sunday. Federation officials also refused to comment about the deadline.</p>
        <p>One player baffled by the suspensions was Tab Ramos of the MetroStars, who is the front-runner to take over Reyna's playmaking role against Costa Rica.</p>
        <p>''Do you think I can get in trouble if I say anything?'' Ramos said. ''We lose our best player for what? I know this opens the door for me, but I'm not waiting for the door to open. I want to get in on my own.''</p>
        <p>Ramos has been playing well and has always done very well against Costa Rica, giving Arena enough reasons to use him Oct. 11.</p>
        <p>The team will gather in Columbus, Ohio, Oct. 5 to prepare for the game.</p>
        <p>Arena said yesterday that Dave Sarachan, his assistant, would be in charge of the team on the bench against Costa Rica.</p>
        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>In Germany, Bayern Munich returned to the top of the Bundesliga with a 3-1 victory Saturday over Unterhaching on goals by the Brazilian Elber and the German internationals Mehmet Scholl and Carsten Jancker. Borussia Dortmund was a 3-2 winner at Hamburg SV thanks to two late goals from Heiko Herrlich. Schalke 04 remained third after a 1-1 draw with Werder Bremen. The pressure continues to mount for Bayer Leverkusen Coach Christoph Daum, whose team lost at home to Hansa Rostock, 2-1.</p>
        <p>In England, Manchester United brushed aside Everton, 3-1, to maintain its undefeated streak. Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored in a span of 11 minutes. The only worry for Manchester United was an injury to its French goalkeeper, Fabien Barthez, which is likely to keep him out of today's Champions League game at Dynamo Kiev.</p>
        <p>In Spain, Barcelona and Real Madrid are apparently paying more attention to the Champions' League. Barcelona suffered a 3-1 loss to Atletico Bilbao and Real Madrid posted a 3-3 tie with Malaga. That enabled Celta Vigo to climb to the top with the defending champion, Deportivo Coruna, which posted victories over Real Sociedad and Racing Santander, respectively.</p>
        <p>In Italy, the start of the Serie A season was delayed until Oct. 1 because of the Olympics, and the Italians have been playing cup games.</p>
