        <p>The tall woman in the silver lame jumpsuit prancing around the Charles Hagar Planetarium of San Francisco State University, singing original love songs to quarks and leptons in a voice that is somewhere between Madonna and Eartha Kitt, is Lynda Jeanne Williams, a performer known around the Bay Area as the Physics Chanteuse.</p>
        <p>Most days, Ms. Williams works as a physics and astronomy instructor at San Francisco State. But occasionally she performs her ''Cosmic Cabaret'' at the planetarium here.</p>
        <p>For a $10 contribution, visitors can watch her present a mixed-media vaudeville act drawn from themes in contemporary physics. ''In the beginning, there was nothing,'' she croons gently, and then she belts out her point, ''And then, BIG BANG! BIG BANG!''</p>
        <p>After the show, in her academic office, she discussed her theatrical alter ego.</p>
        <p>Q. Who exactly is the Physics Chanteuse?</p>
        <p>A. The Physics Chanteuse is my vehicle for expressing my observations about physics. I do it with original songs, parodies, repartee and mixed-media presentations. I think of her as Bette Midler meets Carl Sagan, with a touch of Tom Lehrer and Mae West added to the mix.</p>
        <p>Q. Are physicists a good audience to play before?</p>
        <p>A. Physicists are great! They haven't seen a lot of entertainment about their work. So they tend to enjoy the insider-esoteric references of my routines.</p>
        <p>For instance, I have this number, ''Carbon Is a Girl's Best Friend,'' a kind of play on ''Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.'' The song begins: ''A lithium dose just might cure your depression/but carbon is a girl's best friend.''</p>
        <p>Later in the song, there's a reference to hard carbon nitrides -- the attempt to make something like artificial diamonds. I sang this song at the Midwest Solid State Conference in Nebraska. And after the performance, this very traditional-looking physics professor came up to me and swooned, ''Oh my God, Ms. Williams, you know about nitrides! I can't believe I just heard a song about nitrides!''</p>
        <p>Q. How did the Physics Chanteuse come to be?</p>
        <p>A. I think I was singing and dancing since the day I was born. I've worked as a dancer, and I've taught mixed media production at the San Francisco Art Institute. When I was in graduate school in physics at San Francisco State University, I found myself writing songs about what I was studying. Physics is such a lyrical subject and I just naturally wrote songs about it.</p>
        <p>At the first scientific conference I went to, I saw a need for entertainment specific to the subjects people were discussing. Something clicked. Why not put together an act and perform my songs at professional meetings? Voila! The Physics Chanteuse was born.</p>
        <p>Q. You recently entertained at the ''Kipfest,'' the 60th birthday celebration for the Caltech physics professor Kip Thorne, the pioneer in black hole and gravity wave detection, held at the California Institute of Technology. How did you prepare for that?</p>
        <p>A. I crammed! All of the bigwigs of general relativity were going to be there: Stephen Hawking, John Wheeler and Kip Thorne. It was like studying for my orals all over again, only this time, I'd be singing.</p>
        <p>To begin with, I read everything I could on general relativity, black holes, gravity waves, superstrings, including Kip's paper and his book, ''Black Holes and Time Warps.'' I was also tutored on gravity wave research by Dr. Richard Price, who was organizing the event.</p>
        <p>Then, I got my hands on a ''chirp,'' which is the sound representation of the gravity wave produced when two black holes collide.</p>
        <p>I digitized that sound and created a song called ''Black Hole Song,'' to the tune of the Beatles' ''Blackbird,'' which is about LIGO, the gravity wave detector Kip is building:</p>
        <p>Black holes spinning in the dead of night</p>
        <p>Spiraling around, out of sight,</p>
        <p>Until you collide.</p>
        <p>We are waiting for your waves to arrive.</p>
        <p>Q. I understand that you take your show into the high schools to encourage students to take their math and science studies more seriously?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, I have ''Science Raves,'' which are pep rallies for science and math.</p>
        <p>I present multimedia MTV-style shows and take a streetwise approach so that they don't turn off.</p>
        <p>For instance, I sing a rap song called, ''Player,'' which goes: ''If you want to be a player in this high-tech world, you've got to get down and wrap your mind around science.''</p>
        <p>The idea is, if you don't understand something, you give your power away and that's a dangerous thing in these high-tech times.</p>
        <p>I have another song, ''High-Tech Girl,'' directed specifically at girls at that teen-stage when they give all their power away in order to be attractive to boys. I sing it to Madonna's ''Material Girl'' and it goes like this:</p>
        <p>Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me</p>
        <p>I think they're passe.</p>
        <p>If they can't talk about quantum theory</p>
        <p>I just walk away.</p>
        <p>The video I screen to that number is a montage of about 50 prominent female scientists from the 20th century. My hope is that the girls will find these terrific women inspirational.</p>
        <p>Q. Some of these ''terrific women''  have been less than thrilled with your performances at scientific venues, have they not?</p>
        <p>A. Well, I offered to sing for free for the Women In Physics conference and I sent them a tape of a performance as a sample. They later informed me that they didn't think that what I did was ''appropriate'' for one of their conferences. People should understand that I'm a performance artist doing creative works on science; I'm not a lap dancer. I'm a feminist.</p>
        <p>I have a policy where I won't appear at a conference if there aren't other women presenters. Sometimes I just want to shout, ''Hey, ladies, let's have a sense of humor with our revolution.''</p>
        <p>Q. You say that you are the Mae West of physics. Do you think physics is sexy?</p>
        <p>A. It is the sexiest science. What can be more sexy than the creation of the universe? What can be more sexy than black holes and multiple universe dimensions and cosmic streams that are vibrating in a universal symphony? Scientists often refer to interesting problems as being sexy. The more esoteric and the bigger the budget, the sexier, the problem. Unified field theory is very sexy, and nuclear waste, for some reason, is not. In my opinion, it should be.</p>
        <p>Q. What has been the most difficult audience you've encountered?</p>
        <p>A. I played an international group of about a thousand high energy physicists, a very serious lot, indeed.  Many of them were from China and Japan and they didn't understand a great deal of English.</p>
        <p>Few got my jokes. What's worse, a whole bunch of them got up in midperformance and left in droves. Happily, a few wild Russians, who didn't speak English either, came dashing up to the stage with flowers from a table arrangement and saved the show.</p>
        <p>Now, astronomers are the best scientific audience I've played for. I think it's because to be an astronomer, you have to have a great capacity for fantasy and wonder. They are just an enormously playful group of people. When you play an astronomy convention, they sing along with the karaoke -- they dance in their seats.</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 25, 2000, Monday  A transcript in Science Times on Sept. 19 for an interview with Lynda Jeanne Williams, a physicist and singer whose cabaret act includes songs she writes about physics, misstated the subject of one song. It is cosmic strings, not cosmic streams. The error was reported by a reader in November, and this correction was delayed by efforts to consult Ms. Williams.</p>
