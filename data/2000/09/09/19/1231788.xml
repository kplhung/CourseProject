        <p>Yale Law School Prof Steven Duke letter on Wen Ho Lee case holds it was Judge James A Parker's responsibility, not anyone else's, to determine whether Lee should be detained and under what conditions</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Judge James A. Parker blames ''the top decision makers in the executive branch'' for the unwarranted detention of Wen Ho Lee (transcript, Sept. 14). But it was the judge's responsibility, not anyone else's, to determine whether Mr. Lee should be detained and under what conditions.</p>
        <p>Had Judge Parker been more probing of the Justice Department's nebulous assertions, the detention order would not have been entered. If the judge was deceived, he should begin sanctioning proceedings. If not, he should accept responsibility.</p>

        <p>Attorney General Janet Reno blames Mr. Lee himself for his incarceration, because, after being falsely accused in a 59-count indictment, he declined to surrender his constitutional right of silence and discuss  the missing tapes with the government (news article, Sept. 15). Coming from our chief law enforcement officer, that may be the most shameful claim yet.</p>
