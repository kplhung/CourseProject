        <p>It's unfashionable to praise NBC at Olympic time. The network is scorned for showing the Olympics on tape, for chopping up events to serve its prime-time needs, for being as jingoistic as Georgie Jessel, for sacrificing action for weepy profiles.</p>
        <p>The Sydney Summer Games provokes still more consternation for the seeming irrelevance of NBC showing events at least a half-day after they have occurred in real time. It's an argument that I have joined in when NBC never admitted it was taping the Olympics for repackaging or its taped strategy showed runs in its hosiery. But NBC is confessing to the taping and has done its business with estimable style and skill.</p>

        <p>It's unfashionable to praise NBC at Olympic time. The network is scorned for showing the Olympics on tape, for chopping up events to serve its prime-time needs, for being as jingoistic as Georgie Jessel, for sacrificing action for weepy profiles.</p>
        <p>The Sydney Summer Games provokes still more consternation for the seeming irrelevance of NBC showing events at least a half-day after they have occurred in real time. It's an argument that I have joined in when NBC never admitted it was taping the Olympics for repackaging or its taped strategy showed runs in its hosiery. But NBC is confessing to the taping and has done its business with estimable style and skill.</p>
        <p>So, it's time to stop trying to divine which events NBC could have carried in prime time or to excoriate the network for not breaking into the taped opening ceremony with word that Nancy Johnson of the United States had won a shooting gold medal. Should it have been a bulletin, with a frantic Bob Costas rushing back to his anchor desk from Katie Couric's side?</p>
        <p>And it's time to accept that virtually every event, like the high-profile 200-meter freestyle race that the Australian swimming superstar Ian Thorpe lost on Monday shortly after 7 p.m., Sydney time, was not going to be shown to America by NBC for another 16 to 18 hours.</p>
        <p>As Robert Blake's Baretta character used to say, ''That's da name of dat tune.''</p>
        <p>Through three prime-time telecasts viewed from here via its feed to the United States, NBC has muted its formerly jingoistic Olympic style. Credit the success of non-Americans like Thorpe (who has gotten one lengthy feature and a few, ''Coming up, Ian Thorpe'' promos) and the two triathlon winners, Brigitte McMahon of Switzerland and Simon Whitfield of Canada. Mini-profiles and features have been broadly distributed geographically. Who can forget the scintillating look at the Chinese gymnast Dong Fangxiao, 17, sent by her parents 14 years ago for athletic training 500 miles from home, and her awkward twice-a-year visits with her mother and father?</p>
        <p>NBC still tinkles those old jingo bells, but the network seems a little rusty. (Look, but don't hope, for the bells to recover for track and field.) While trying to elevate the American female gymnasts beyond their abilities, the announcers Al Trautwig and Tim Daggett have been harsh in assessing the pixies' failings.</p>
        <p>But credit Sydney for NBC's good behavior. The city, and the country, are stars as big as anyone here. Beauty shots elevate the attraction of outdoor events. Indoor events look dull. Can't NBC move wrestling to a barge on Sydney Harbor?</p>
        <p>A sampling of other views, impressions and notes:</p>
        <p>*Costas and Couric ably handled the opening ceremony. Both announcers noted that the caldron had stalled -- unlike the Australian Channel 7 network tandem, who ignored the glitch. Costas whimsically speculated that only Zeus's reappearance in Athens in 2004 could top Friday's caldron lighting by Cathy Freeman and Muhammad Ali's lighting of the firepot in 1996.</p>
        <p>*Daggett's analysis has been the best of NBC's group so far. He offers bluntness, an easy way of explaining the sport's intricacies, and an enormous love of gymnastics. Most improved is Dan Hicks, whose golf work hasn't shown the type of enthusiasm he has brought to swimming. But he must beware of being more excited for Americans than others.</p>
        <p>*The digitally inserted lane numbers with country flags is a productive innovation at swimming, as is the computerized line that shows where a swimmer is in relation to a world record.</p>
        <p>*The feature on Sunday about the Sydney-born spy and the Solomon Islands native who saved John F. Kennedy's life after a Japanese destroyer totaled his PT boat combined little-remembered history, narrative verve and a taste of ''Survivor.'' Later during the Games, NBC will show an even better story about the Australian soldiers killed at Gallipoli in World War I.</p>
        <p>*And let the wonderful word go forth: the overwrought John Tesh is not working for NBC! Trautwig brings his solid reportorial skills, affinity for the sport and heart (though not a bleeding one). After a profile of the Australian gymnast Alanna Slater, whose father died in an air crash, she scored a 9.625 score in her floor exercise. ''You know what, Alanna Slater?'' Trautwig said. ''Life owes you a moment like this.''</p>
        <p>*Two nights of competition and two lengthy report/ features on foreign wrestlers! Has NBC fallen into the Vasily Alekseyeev time warp?</p>
        <p>*Get rid of those NBC Web site promos. If NBC won't, then stop the wholesale shrinking of the screen to push viewers to go on line for the Olympics Web site. NBC must have lost its collective common sense when it shrank the screen during Freeman's caldron lighting.</p>
        <p>*NBC's Friday night feature about the Salt Lake City Olympic bribery scandal offered no new skullduggery, but it was a solid primer for viewers unfamiliar with the byzantine International Olympic Committee. The report bore the unseen imprint of Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports, who served on the I.O.C.'s reform commission.</p>
