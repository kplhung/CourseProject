        <p>Dozens of protesters held a vigil today outside the compound of Peru's shadowy and powerful intelligence chief, demanding his arrest. He is believed to be at the heart of President Alberto K. Fujimori's unexpected call for new elections.</p>
        <p>But the intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, remained out of sight; a radio station reported that the military had arrested him, and his sister filed a writ of habeas corpus. But late tonight the minister of justice, Alberto Bustamante, appeared on television and said he ''cannot say where he is for security reasons.</p>
        <p>''I know he is in Lima,'' he added, ''and he is not being detained.''</p>
        <p>The uncertainties surrounding Mr. Montesinos added to the swirl of rumors and speculation that was unleashed when Mr. Fujimori shocked the nation on Saturday night by announcing that he was dismantling the National Intelligence Service and was calling for new elections in which he would not seek office.</p>
        <p>At a rally downtown tonight, the opposition leader, Alejandro Toledo, spoke of the need for elections soon.</p>
        <p>Saying ''you cannot democratize a dictator,'' Mr. Toledo insisted that voting should be held within four months, and in the meantime, there should be an emergency transition government, headed by a person ''of credibility.'' Mr. Toledo challenged Mr. Fujimori for office earlier this year, and then withdrew from the runoff after he charged that the president was manipulating the race.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the justice minister, Mr. Bustamante, talked of having elections months later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo told the crowd tonight: ''The moment has come for reconciliation and national unity among all Peruvians who want democracy. We did not fight abuse for so many years for ourselves to practice the same thing.''</p>
        <p>The crowd of some 10,000 people chanted in front of Mr. Toledo: ''Democracy already! The dictatorship will fall!''</p>
        <p>As the head of intelligence agency, Mr. Montesinos was an important figure in the government, and a primary factor in its fall. He emerged into an uncomfortable spotlight last week when a videotape surfaced that apparently showed him offering a $15,000 bribe to an opposition congressman. The disclosure prompted Mr. Fujimori, his patron, to make his stunning announcement to the nation.</p>
        <p>The armed forces, over which Mr. Montesinos wielded substantial influence, were silent today on his whereabouts -- and even on where they stood on Mr. Fujimori's decision. That prompted fears among citizens that the armed forces might be planning a coup.</p>
        <p>Many Peruvians say they will not believe Mr. Fujimori's promise of a democratic transition until Mr. Montesinos is arrested and brought to trial. All day long, dozens of people lined up on the street along the wall that encircles the intelligence office seeking the arrest of a man they said had long been Mr. Fujimori's most trusted dirty-tricks operative.</p>
        <p>''We are going to be here and not rest until the criminal, Vladimiro Montesinos, is brought up on charges and jailed, because he is the one who deserves it,'' said Victor Delfin, one of the protesters who belongs to the Civil Society Collaborative. ''He has been the boss of corruption with the acceptance of his partner, Alberto Fujimori. We cannot let down our guard. It is our moral obligation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Delfin was at the head of a long line of silent protesters who held spotless red and white Peruvian flags that they have washed each week in protests to call attention to fraud and electoral abuses. To them, Mr. Montesinos embodied the worst of the leadership that has been in power for a decade and has been accused of corruption, fraud and rights abuses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montesinos, who was born into a family of Marxists who named him after Lenin, is seen by many as the power who lurked in Mr. Fujimori's shadow. He was an intelligence officer who reached the rank of captain, but was discharged in 1977 for selling state secrets to the Central Intelligence Agency. He later studied law and defended drug traffickers.</p>
        <p>His association with Mr. Fujimori, an engineer who entered politics as a virtual unknown a decade ago, have benefited both men. Mr. Montesinos was said to have helped Mr. Fujimori sort out a number of messy personal and political problems. A book published in Peru earlier this year alleged that he was instrumental in closing the Congress and the Supreme Court in 1992, when Mr. Fujimori mounted the ''auto-coup'' that solidified his power as he embarked on an increasingly authoritarian route in the name of fighting the Shining Path terrorist group.</p>
        <p>But he was also suspected of being behind the manipulations and ballot fraud that marked Mr. Fujimori's third run for office earlier this year. Yet, throughout his tenure as intelligence chief, Mr. Montesinos clearly regained the influence, if not prestige, he had from his early spying days as he maintained files on opponents and allies alike. He clearly had the support of Mr. Fujimori, who credited him with masterminding the successful rescue of dozens of people who had been held hostage at the Japanese Embassy by a guerrilla group in 1997.</p>
        <p>The unraveling of his influence began a few weeks ago when Mr. Fujimori announced the discovery of an arms-smuggling ring that sent rifles from Jordan to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Jordanian and American officials discounted the story, and opposition parties began to say that Mr. Montesinos and military colleagues themselves had been engaged in arms-running to the Colombian guerrillas.</p>
        <p>International groups had already been pressuring Mr. Fujimori to jettison his intelligence chief, and the evidence of a bribe on videotape presented him with such an opportunity. But it appears that the military may have hesitated to go along, whether out of concern for other secrets Mr. Montesinos may possess or uncertainty over Mr. Fujimori's intentions. The military command's silence has only increased speculation about what is happening behind the  brick wall around its compound.</p>
        <p>''As hours pass without any signal that Montesinos is relieved of his post and jailed, the speculation increases,'' said Diego Garcia-Sayan, the executive director of the Andean Commission of Jurists. ''Are they resisting or planning or negotiating? Who knows?''</p>
        <p>Although opposition groups were buoyed by Mr. Fujimori's initial declarations, they have grown worried about his prolonged silence on his spymaster. If the opposition resumes talks with the government, sponsored by the Organization of American States, they could try to find a path to new elections. The opposition distrusts the Congress, and some have called for its dissolution because of the bribery allegations. One option for passing the laws that would enable elections would be to form a panel of political parties that would negotiate a framework with Mr. Fujimori.</p>
        <p>''The agenda is very simple,'' Mr. Garcia-Sayan said. ''I do not believe that in either Peru or South Africa that you can have a transition without such an accord between the parties in the conflict. If not, you will have a Pandora's box of instability.''</p>
        <p>And while some have called for Mr. Fujimori himself to step down before elections, that is doubtful.</p>
        <p>''The few reins of power that Fujimori still has will be used to assure certain things in a transition,'' Mr. Garcia-Sayan said. ''He wants assurances. After 10 years of a government accused of corruption and human rights violations, he may be worried.''</p>
