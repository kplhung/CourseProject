        <p>''It's a goat rodeo,'' James LaForce, a fashion publicist, said the other day, as Fashion Week began gathering momentum. And who could resist the characterization?

        <p>''It's a goat rodeo,'' James LaForce, a fashion publicist, said the other day, as Fashion Week began gathering momentum. And who could resist the characterization? Like those clever ungulates, the fashion herd is nimble, wily and stubborn. And, if one may generalize, they're probably harder than goats to corral.</p>
        <p>Consider the matter of seating. It was Joan Harting Barham, a veteran fashion journalist, who once pointed out that no one ever looks to see who's located behind him at a runway show. In the hierarchy of status, there's always someone better placed. Getting people properly seated is often a matter requiring not merely a first-class mailing list and diplomatic skills worthy of the Hapsburg court, but a whip and a chair.</p>
        <p>''It's like getting the seating right on an airplane,'' said Mr. LaForce, whose firm, LaForce &amp; Stevens, handled the seating plan for Perry Ellis, William Reid and Escada. A signal difference between airline and fashion seating, however, is that no one buys tickets to a runway show or has any compunction to show up.</p>
        <p>''You have to double-book to try to fill the house and fill it with the right people,'' Mr. LaForce said. To say that the right people don't always get along is putting it mildly; there are, in fashion, vendettas to consider that would make Tony Soprano look like Casper Milquetoast. Then, too, there are those who mistakenly think of themselves as the right people, requiring tactful correction. Think velvet rope and Studio 54.</p>
        <p>''Going from Fairchild to Mirabella, I went from the front row to the fifth row overnight,'' said Richard Buckley, the editor of Vogue Hommes, at a Holland &amp; Holland show on Saturday. ''When I did Dutch, we were in the fifth row,'' he said, until the pack discovered that magazine, ''then we went to Row 1.'' In fashion, as Mr. Buckley pointed out, ''everything is perception.''</p>
        <p>''People have very short memories,'' he said. ''It's sad as well as funny. Of course, it's never funny if you're the one who's behind.''</p>
        <p>One of the best things historically about Seventh on Sixth has been its partial sponsorship by Evian. With the possible exception of the coffee kiosks set up for a season or two by Vogue -- Ford models struggled valiantly to master the foam spout on the cappuccino machines, buyers swooned -- the tentside coolers filled with spring water are among Fashion Week's few consistently welcome sights.</p>
        <p>The little bottles tucked neatly into both Hermes Birken bags and rucksacks. Their contents helped nervous editors stay hydrated. They also added nutritional balance to a model's lunch of Tic Tacs and a Marlboro Light. This season, however, Evian did something unexpected. It changed its look.</p>
        <p>Is it succumbing to hopeless nostalgia to long for a day when water bottles were not subject to the whims of fashion? It is. The nipplelike pop-up sports caps on the old bottles are so five years ago, said Michael Neuwirth, a spokesman for Evian. Make way, then, for a bulbous hourglass of plastic with a ring-shaped carrying cap, called the Nomad.</p>
        <p>Visually resembling the marriage of a baby bottle and a hand grenade, the 75-centiliter Nomad looks vaguely as though one ought to yank the ring off with one's teeth and storm an enemy pillbox. It will cost $2.09 when it is available in the United States in several months. At the tents, according to Evian, fashionistas are going through 20 cases every two hours.</p>
        <p>''No, it's not me, not me at all,'' Patricia Field said on Sunday at Diane Von Furstenberg's show, held in the designer's colossal West 12th Street building. Ms. Field, the exuberantly fashion-forward retailer and costume designer, was, of all things, declining credit for launching a fad. Since when was modesty in vogue?</p>
        <p>As a designer for ''Sex and the City,'' Ms. Field  this season gave American women the chance to get in touch with their inner prom queens by reviving the silk flower corsage. Or so one thought. But Ms. Field insists that the idea originated not with her but with Sarah Jessica Parker, the show's star.</p>
        <p>''Sarah is definitely one of the costume designers,'' on the show, said Ms. Field, who was dressed casually (for her) in a fitted Armani jacket, shoes she called ''toe cleavage yellow snakeskin stilettos,'' with a gold leather Irish fisherman's hat jammed tight on a mop of ringlets colored Crayola red. ''She came to me at one point,'' Ms. Field said, ''and asked me, 'What about flowers? Flowers. Flower something.' I said, 'Why not?' So we went with the flowers. It works. Really, she's always crediting me and I want to throw it back. She's totally fashion wise and savvy. Really a gem.''</p>
