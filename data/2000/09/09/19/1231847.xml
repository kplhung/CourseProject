        <p>At ease in a Manhattan hotel ballroom filled mostly with Democratic women, Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday made a broad appeal for women to support her Senate campaign, casting her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A.

        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who addressed a fund-raising luncheon for Democratic women in the State Legislature and in Congress, concentrated on issues considered important to women. She pledged to devote her time in the Senate to things like gun safety, health care, education and care for the elderly, and also promised to vote against any nominee to the United States Supreme Court who would overturn abortion rights.</p>

        <p>At ease in a Manhattan hotel ballroom filled mostly with Democratic women, Hillary Rodham Clinton yesterday made a broad appeal for women to support her Senate campaign, casting her Republican opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, as a bully in last week's debate and dismissing his tax plan as misleading and mathematically unsound.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who addressed a fund-raising luncheon for Democratic women in the State Legislature and in Congress, concentrated on issues considered important to women. She pledged to devote her time in the Senate to things like gun safety, health care, education and care for the elderly, and also promised to vote against any nominee to the United States Supreme Court who would overturn abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Most pointedly, however, Mrs. Clinton exploited an opportunity before a friendly audience of women to make a concerted attack on Mr. Lazio's debate tactics. Many supporters of Mrs. Clinton said they found Mr. Lazio to be pushy and disrespectful during the debate in Buffalo -- bullying her in a way that he would not have bullied a male opponent.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers have seized on that notion to blunt favorable portrayals of Mr. Lazio as strong-willed and determined, and Mrs. Clinton joined the effort yesterday. Expanding on a comment she made the morning after the debate, Mrs. Clinton received knowing chuckles and applause when she said having two younger brothers was the best preparation for her sometimes bruising encounter with Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Then she complained of having to share her lectern with an overly aggressive Mr. Lazio. (He approached her at the end of the debate and urged her to sign a document he said was a promise not to raise or spend any more soft money.) She recalled an old law school maxim that lawyers without the law or facts behind them usually ''pound on the table'' as a distraction.</p>
        <p>''There is a big difference between raising your voice and raising up the quality of education in our schools,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''There is a big difference between pointing your finger and reaching out your hand to improve the quality of life for the people who need health and good jobs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, after riding the Long Island Rail Road to Pennsylvania Station from his home yesterday and picking up the endorsement of five railroad unions, was asked by reporters about the debate.</p>
        <p>''How about that idea that you turned off women voters?'' Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV asked.</p>
        <p>''It's absolutely not borne out by the people who have been around me,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''If you look at the crowds that we've had since the debates, the crowds are enthusiastic. The women are enthusiastic. People want to know that you're going to fight for New York, that you're not going to be a pushover in the Senate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said women were being sold short by suggestions that they would not vote for him because he gave Mrs. Clinton a tough debate.</p>
        <p>''It's probably not respecting the judgment of women in New York,'' he said. ''Women in New York know that they need to have somebody who's going to be a strong advocate for them in the Senate, somebody that will be there for them. You got to be able to not just talk about things, but actually get the job done.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has never been elected to public office, but she presented herself yesterday as the experienced choice in the race, citing her work as an intern in the 1970's with the Children's Defense Fund and her recent participation as first lady in formulating President Clinton's failed health-care overhaul.</p>
        <p>By contrast, she said Mr. Lazio and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are proposing ''irresponsible, risky schemes'' that have not been tested and are bound to fail. She cited a new advertisement by Mr. Lazio that focuses on his proposed tax plan, which Mrs. Clinton and several independent experts say would cost more than Mr. Lazio suggests.</p>
        <p>''He keeps repeating that his tax plan is $776 billion. In reality, it costs over $1 trillion,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>At the railroad event, Mr. Lazio picked up endorsements from five unions associated with the Long Island and Staten Island railroads.</p>
        <p>Generally, most unions, including the A.F.L.-C.I.O., have backed Mrs. Clinton, but in a change of pace, Mr. Lazio received endorsements from the United Transportation Union, which represents conductors, trainmen, track workers, car inspectors, car cleaners and bartenders; the Independent Railway Supervisors Association; the National Conference of Firemen and Oilers; the National Transportation Supervisors Association; and the United Transportation Union/Yardmasters. The five unions combined represent more than 3,200 railroad employees.</p>
