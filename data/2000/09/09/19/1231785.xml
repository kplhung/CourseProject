        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a member of the delegation that helped reopen the synagogue near Auschwitz, I was dismayed to see that your Sept. 13 news article about the reopening was cast through the lens of conflict with the opening of a local disco.</p>
        <p>Obviously, one could question the judgment behind creating a disco in that location. But both building the disco and reopening the synagogue may be seen as calls to life.</p>

        <p>As a member of the delegation that helped reopen the synagogue near Auschwitz, I was dismayed to see that your Sept. 13 news article about the reopening was cast through the lens of conflict with the opening of a local disco.</p>
        <p>Obviously, one could question the judgment behind creating a disco in that location. But both building the disco and reopening the synagogue may be seen as calls to life.</p>
        <p>While members of the Jewish and local communities may not always appreciate each other's response to Auschwitz and to contemporary life in Oswiecim, there must be some way to trust each other's motivations. There must be some way to affirm life -- especially in the shadow of one of the world's largest graveyards.</p>
