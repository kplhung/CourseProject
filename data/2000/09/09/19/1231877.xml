        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Richard Rhodes (Op-Ed, Sept. 17) argues persuasively that no evidence links the mock violence portrayed in the media to violence by real people. In fact, both are reflections of a culture that encourages such behavior.</p>
        <p>Society at large endorses violence and killing to resolve issues, and people elect political leaders who have this attitude.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Richard Rhodes (Op-Ed, Sept. 17) argues persuasively that no evidence links the mock violence portrayed in the media to violence by real people. In fact, both are reflections of a culture that encourages such behavior.</p>
        <p>Society at large endorses violence and killing to resolve issues, and people elect political leaders who have this attitude.</p>
        <p>The death penalty is society's ultimate violence. There is no evidence that it accomplishes more than a ''good'' feeling of retribution, which some call justice. If political leaders wish to lead on the issue of violence in society, they should focus less  on fantasy violence and pay more attention to socially approved real violence.</p>
