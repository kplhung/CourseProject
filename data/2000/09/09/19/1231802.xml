        <p>The presidential candidates are taking their parties to new places with their education proposals: Al Gore has called for higher standards for teachers as well as higher pay, while George W. Bush has emphasized closing the achievement gap between rich and poor and holding schools accountable for student performance. Yet no matter who wins in November, there is little reason to believe that any serious improvement is in the offing.</p>
        <p>This is because neither candidate is willing to confront the underlying obstacle to real change: the premise that the basic responsibility for education rests with communities and states, not the federal government.</p>
        <p>Americans have become so accustomed to trashing Big Government that calling for Washington to take charge of education might sound absurd. Indeed, today's conventional wisdom points toward privatization -- the dismantling of large state education systems through vouchers and charter schools. But educational equity will only be possible through a national system that insures a minimum standard of excellence.</p>
        <p>Consider the effects of our patchwork quilt of local governance. Our schools have become a battleground for local disputes over prayer in school, for example, and property taxes, issues that have little to do with education. School boards are notoriously unstable. The country has nearly 15,000 boards, and the average term of a member is less than four years. In New York state, one-quarter of the membership changes every year. As a result, superintendents are hired and fired too rapidly. In urban school districts, the average length of service is under three years; nationally, the average is six years.</p>
        <p>Annual school board elections and voter approval of school budgets are among the last bastions of direct democracy, but noble as that citizen involvement may be, why should children frequently be the victims of voters' frustration over their own powerlessness in other aspects of politics? And why do we continue to finance schools primarily on property assessments in an age when real estate is no longer the dominant source of wealth?</p>
        <p>The results of this system are all too clear. In August, the Department of Education released its latest report card, a three-decade survey of performance by 9-, 13- and 17-year-olds. Reading scores remained flat in all age groups. And they were not high to begin with. In science, 9-year-olds showed no improvement at all throughout the 1990's, and the scores of 17-year-olds today were lower than in 1969. At a time of rapid economic and scientific progress, learning in America stands still.</p>
        <p>Every other developed nation has a national system of education. We too should insist that our students and teachers meet stringent national and international standards. The current supplemental grants from Washington are insufficent to bridge the gap between rich and poor districts: school spending should come primarily from the federal budget, based on income tax revenues.</p>
        <p>And some improvements can be achieved without creating more federal bureaucracy. For example, as Gov. Gray Davis of California has suggested, we can use the tax code. We could in effect raise salaries by exempting teachers in public schools from state and federal income taxes.</p>
        <p>And contrary to the claims of some, there is no constitutional objection to a larger federal role. The framers did not directly exclude education from the federal agenda.</p>
        <p>If one wants a clear constitutional basis for rethinking the federal role, look to the interstate commerce clause. The Internet has made it plain that information and knowledge cross state lines. If that argument seems a bit too clever, consider that since we live now in the so-called global economy, contingent on scientific knowledge and high levels of literacy, should not education be deemed essential to the national defense and foreign policy? There are many precedents in constitutional interpretation that can permit a 21st-century America to abandon 18th-century practices.</p>
        <p>As things stand now, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore can say anything they want about education, but in the end, they can't be held accountable. A real ''education president'' would be one who admits that our education crisis cuts across state lines, and that the solution is a federal system based on national standards and paid for with federal dollars.</p>
