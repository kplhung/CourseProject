        <p>The spending cuts and new revenues that Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau county executive, is counting on to help balance the county's troubled finances could instead wreak havoc on cities and towns here in the years to come, officials say.</p>
        <p>If none of the budget proposals kick in -- and state and local officials said two of the largest ones most likely will not -- the county will face a cumulative deficit of nearly $200 million by 2004, said a fiscal analyst for the county legislature.</p>
        <p>Republican and Democratic officials said they feared the plan would eventually foist the county's problems onto local municipalities and agencies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's proposal, released Friday, includes: $74.5 million in unspecified spending cuts; $50 million in reduced aid to the county's three towns and two cities; $25 million in union concessions that have not been negotiated; $7 million in savings realized by forcing school districts to pick up most of the tab when residents successfully challenge their property taxes; the elimination of the county subsidy to the Long Island Bus system; and money from leasing out land the county does not yet own.</p>
        <p>The initiatives are drawing increasing criticism three days after Mr. Gulotta submitted his plan to a state panel overseeing the county's finances, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority. The panel could take control of the county's finances if other budget proposals by Mr. Gulotta do not materialize next year, and if a more than $300 million cumulative deficit is not erased over the next three years.</p>
        <p>Dianne Baumert-Moyik, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, would not comment today and said the county executive was unavailable for an interview.</p>
        <p>But Democratic and Republican officials on the state and local level said the county's fiscal future appeared less and less secure.</p>
        <p>''I do not believe it balances the budget,'' Darren Bloch, the chief of staff of the Democratic majority, said today of Mr. Gulotta's plan.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Bloch added: ''I believe there is enough confidence that the Legislature can take what isn't in the budget or what does not work in the budget and make it work; that a control board can be avoided. But it is not going to be easy.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Gulotta's more disputed proposals would cut, beginning in 2003, all $50 million in county sales tax revenue that it now passes on to the county's towns and cities.</p>
        <p>In the 2001 budget, those revenues are earmarked for specific uses, like closing a landfill, officials said. Taking it away could force town or city service cuts or sharp tax hikes.</p>
        <p>''To do this is just exporting the chaos and instability of the county to the towns and cities and is very unfair,'' said Richard V. Guardino, the supervisor of the Town of Hempstead. ''Because we have managed our municipal budgets well and he has not.'' He was referring to his fellow Republican, Mr. Gulotta.</p>
        <p>Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi of Glen Cove, a Democrat, said he would have to raise city taxes by between 6 and 7 percent to make up the difference. He called a sales-tax cut ''so tenuous that it is almost unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>Two state legislators from Nassau -- Dean G. Skelos, a Republican who is deputy majority leader of the Senate, and Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, the Nassau County Democratic Party Chairman -- said the sales-tax initiative would likely not pass in Albany. Legislative approval is needed for the county to hold onto the sales tax.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's idea to make county school districts pay part of the property-tax refunds would also likely not gain support among state legislators, Mr. Skelos and Mr. DiNapoli said.</p>
        <p>Under existing law, when a resident wins a school-tax refund, the county pays all of it, though county taxes make up just 19 percent of overall property-tax bills. Mr. Gulotta's plan, which would take effect in 2004, would force the districts to pay their part, about 60 percent.</p>
        <p>Officials also questioned Mr. Gulotta's $74.5 in spending cuts -- $27 million in 2002, $25 million in 2003 and $22.5 in 2004 -- because they are not itemized in the budget.</p>
        <p>And they questioned the $1.6 million in revenue Mr. Gulotta expects to receive next year for leasing out 100 acres of land in Bethpage. A deal between the county and the United States Navy over the site where the old Grumman plant stood is still being worked out.</p>
        <p>Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican legislative minority leader, said that a troubling picture of the future was  emerging.</p>
        <p>''The out-year stuff is certainly speculative,'' he said of the plans to shore up budget gaps in 2002, 2003 and 2004. ''Especially the out, out years.''</p>
