        <p>Patrick J. Buchanan roared back from his sickbed tonight to resume his fight for the country's soul, using the richly symbolic podium of Bob Jones University to declare his high-decibel presence as the Reform Party presidential candidate in the remaining weeks of the campaign.</p>
        <p>He looked slightly drawn from his  recent gall-bladder surgery but seemed to have lost none of his ardor in condemning the de-Christianization of America, the acceptance of homosexuality and the one-world visions of the United Nations, which he promised to expel from the country if elected.</p>
        <p>From the World Trade Organization to the decline of Christopher Columbus, he made clear that the Reform Party platform would be his well-known agenda.</p>
        <p>''I fear that here at home they are abolishing America,'' he said, referring to what he called a loose coalition of Supreme Court justices, Northeastern universities and entertainment executives. ''They are deconstructing our country. And this is one of the great issues of our time, which really should be addressed in a presidential campaign.''</p>
        <p>He won repeated applause from an  audience of about 1,500 residents and students at the fundamentalist Christian college, and from Bob Jones III, the university's president, who praised him as a ''brave soldier'' trying to keep the nation from slipping over the precipice.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas had been criticized for appearing here in February while saying nothing about the institution's onetime policy of forbidding interracial dating, since changed, and its disagreement with the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
        <p>''The press had it all wrong when they vilified George Bush for coming here as he did,'' Mr. Jones said, stressing the similarities of Mr. Buchanan and the school as mavericks who revel in defying the mainstream.</p>
        <p>The speech was Mr. Buchanan's first since his mid-August operation, and his recuperation could not come at a worse time for Mr. Bush, whose Republican Party Mr. Buchanan ridiculed as having lost the will to fight in tonight's speech.</p>
        <p>Now that it is clear that Mr. Buchanan will use the Reform Party platform for his own sharp-elbowed positions, he has the opportunity to begin drawing off a few like-minded conservative voters, particularly in southern states like South Carolina, at a moment when Mr. Bush is eager to regain his edge in national polls from Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan listed several ways in which he said the ''elites'' were dismantling America, and chief among them was the effort to remove Christianity as the moral foundation of the country.</p>
        <p>''Woodrow Wilson said America was born a Christian nation,'' he said, ''but if you say that today, you are guilty of intolerance to others and you will be shouted down in the American capital. Now who de-Christianized America? In my judgment the principal culprit is the United States Supreme Court.''</p>
        <p>He also listed the growing acceptance of homosexuality as a key element in the country's decline, citing particularly the legalization of gay civil unions in Vermont.</p>
        <p>If elected, Mr. Buchanan promised, he would bring home American troops from Europe and the Middle East and station them at the Mexican border to protect the country from rampant illegal immigration. He said he would close the National Endowment for the Arts and the Department of Education, and called for a new Legion of Decency to monitor the entertainment industry and assist in boycotting its ''pollution.''</p>
        <p>He even reprised his famous line from the 1992 Republican National Convention that there remains a religious war for the country's soul, adding a postscript that eight years of President Bill Clinton convinced him he understated his case. He said he left the Republican party because he was tired of the poll-tested pabulum of the country's two-party politics.</p>
        <p>''We may not succeed, but I believe we need a new fighting conservative traditionalist party in America,'' he said. ''I believe, and I hope, that one day we can take America back. That is why we are building this Gideon's army, and heading for Armageddon, to do battle for the Lord.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan's beliefs may not get him anywhere close to the 15 percent in national polls he needs to participate in televised debates, but his biblical references and political orthodoxy were immensely popular in the auditorium here.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of solemnly dressed students crowded around him after the speech seeking autographs, and several students eagerly said they would vote for him whether he has a chance or not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones said the address was the work of a ''lonely man, bravely annunciating the truth.'' The country will probably not survive another Democratic victory this year, he said, and only a man like Mr. Buchanan, who says what he believes and does not care whether he wins, can speak the truth that will save it.</p>
