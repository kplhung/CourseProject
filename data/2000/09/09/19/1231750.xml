        <p>Wherever she has played the past  five years  college, professional or pickup -- Katie Smith's job description was simple: go-to player.</p>
        <p>She usually took the most shots, scored the most points and got used to having the basketball in her hands with the game on the line. Yet playing alongside Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, Nikki McCray and the awesome cast of the United States Olympic women's team, Smith learned, can whittle at your confidence and minutes.</p>
        <p>''We're so deep,'' Smith said, ''that you just go in for your 12 minutes and understand your role. You just get used to it. It's a lot of fun coming off the bench.''</p>
        <p>Smith, a Team USA reserve shooting guard, reverted tonight to her persona as a Women's National Basketball Association All-Star. When she was through knocking down all six of her field goals, including three 3-pointers, at the Dome in Olympic Park, the United States had routed Cuba, 90-61, and looked for all the world like a team with 12 starters.</p>
        <p>Whether the victory sent a message to Russia -- one of Team USA's obstacles to the gold medal and Wednesday's preliminary-round opponent -- is unclear. But the way Smith led the United States in scoring with 15 points, coupled with the way the backup point guard Dawn Staley moved the ball and the reserve forward Natalie Williams rebounded, it appeared as if Team USA's bench could bring home gold on its own.</p>
        <p>''You think you got them, and then they come in with their second five,'' said Christi Harrower, the Australian point guard, after an exhibition last week against Team USA. ''There is hardly any drop-off. In fact, sometimes there is none.''</p>
        <p>The Australians, considered to be another United States rival here, topped Brazil, 81-70, later in a key Group A game. Lauren Jackson's 19 points led the winners, as Australia made 60 percent of its shots in the second half.</p>
        <p>The Aussies (2-0) are trying to set themselves up for a showdown with the United States (2-0) in the medal round.</p>
        <p>Not that anyone genuinely craves a matchup with the United States. The Americans shot 55.1 percent from the field and outrebounded Cuba by 34-20. The lithe and skilled Cuban center, Yamilet Martinez, fought her way inside for 19 points. But she picked up her third and fourth fouls within 50 seconds of each other with 16 minutes 45 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>With Cuba trailing by only 50-46 moments earlier, the United States went on a 14-4 run with Martinez out of the game.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the game was a carbon copy of so many others featuring the Americans. The opponent stayed close in the first half, gave off upset vibes and then was overwhelmed by defensive pressure and sheer depth.</p>
        <p>''Everyone knows you have to sacrifice your regular role on this team,'' said Swoopes, who scored 11 points, grabbed 5 rebounds and distributed 5 assists. ''A lot of us are stars in the W.N.B.A. But with so much talent, you go from sometimes being an offensive specialist to a defensive specialist. Everyone is willing to do that.''</p>
        <p>Playing behind Teresa Edwards, Staley finished with eight assists. She was responsible for increasing the tempo in the second half as the United States blew the game open. Team USA's bench outscored Cuba's, 44-17.</p>
        <p>After the game, Swoopes and her teammates were motivated for the showdown with Russia -- a game that would indeed show the Americans the distance between themselves and the rest of the medal contenders.</p>
        <p>''They're very physical and very dirty,'' Swoopes said. ''They're definitely one of our biggest rivals.''</p>
