        <p>A deal has tentatively been struck that would allow a 75-story skyscraper to be built in one of Manhattan's most valuable holes in the ground, the long-vacant and foreboding site of the old Alexander's department store at Lexington Avenue and 59th Street.</p>
        <p>After two years of stop-and-go negotiations, Bloomberg, the financial information services company, has agreed in principle to be the anchor tenant for the proposed 1.3-million-square-foot tower, which would be taller than the Trump World Tower going up near the United Nations, executives on both sides of the negotiations said.</p>
        <p>If a final deal is reached in the coming weeks, Bloomberg would move its headquarters and hundreds of employees one block from Park Avenue to a $400 million tower that is to be built on the Lexington Avenue site. A deal with Bloomberg, which would take about 450,000 square feet of space, would enable construction to begin on the long-awaited project by the developer Steven Roth.</p>
        <p>The skyscraper would soar 900 feet, about 150 feet higher than the tallest tower in the Time Warner Center project at Columbus Circle that is being built by Stephen M. Ross, and 50 feet taller than Donald J. Trump's building, which is going up on First Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump took comfort in the fact that he could still claim to have the tallest all-residential tower in the world.</p>
        <p>The tower proposed by Mr. Roth, the chairman of Vornado Realty Trust, would mix office space with expensive retail stores, a five-star hotel and what real estate brokers are calling 200 superluxury condominiums.</p>
        <p>Wendi Kopsick, a spokeswoman for Vornado Realty Trust, declined to comment, as did Chris Taylor, a spokeswoman for Bloomberg, and their broker, Barry Gossin, chief executive of Newmark &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>But executives from both sides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that there was a breakthrough at a meeting on Friday.</p>
        <p>''They seem to have come to terms,'' said one person who works with Vornado. ''It's clearly been going on for a long time.''</p>
        <p>Cesar Pelli, the architect who designed the world's tallest buildings, the Petronas Towers in Malaysia, is finishing plans for the skyscraper on what is now a deep two-acre hole surrounded by a blue construction fence across the street from Bloomingdale's. Alexander's closed in 1992, and the hulking department store was demolished last year.</p>
        <p>Local residents, who have spent the last year fighting Mr. Trump's project near the United Nations, were not enthusiastic about yet another huge building going up in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth's tower, like Trump World Tower, is an as-of-right building that does not require zoning variances or city approval.</p>
        <p>''We always knew it was going to be a mega-building,'' said Edward Rubin, a member of the local community board. ''But we've gotten a little numb after the Trump building. These are two examples of what happens when you don't have the right zoning controls in place.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth's 200 condominiums, on the 28th through 75th floors, would compete directly with the 225 superluxury condominiums at Time Warner Center. The apartments in both buildings would sell for more than three times the average condominium price today: $2,000 a square foot, or $6 million for a 3,000-square-foot apartment.</p>
        <p>It would be a dramatic turnabout for the vacant site, which sat like a gray hulk in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country, much to the dismay of its neighbors. Mr. Roth has long wanted to build his own major skyscraper there, but for one reason or another, he had failed to strike a deal over the years with a string of blue-chip tenants, including Sotheby's, Christie's and Ritz-Carlton.</p>
        <p>The pending deal with Bloomberg nearly fell apart in July, said one person involved in the negotiations, when Mr. Roth tried to increase what the company thought was an already exorbitant rent.</p>
        <p>''Steve is a very hard guy to make a deal with,'' he said. ''He wants to get every ounce of blood. You can't live that way.''</p>
        <p>The tactic also fueled the opposition of one of Bloomberg's financial advisers, who had not favored the Vornado project. But, two executives said, Michael Bloomberg, chairman of the company he founded, was determined to close a deal at what he thought would be a signature, if expensive, skyscraper.</p>
        <p>In a compromise of sorts, Bloomberg decided recently to take more space in the building, but at the agreed-upon rent, nearly $70 a square foot. The asking rent in Midtown today is $61 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''This was never about economics,'' said one top real estate broker who knows Mr. Bloomberg.</p>
        <p>A deal with Bloomberg would bring to an end a long travail for Mr. Roth, the irascible one-time suburban shopping strip king who has become a major commercial landlord in Manhattan. He gained control of the ailing Alexander's in 1991, killing the department store chain in favor of the real estate beneath the buildings.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, Mr. Roth tried to find a partner among the city's real estate families, but they found his complex financing plan too exotic.</p>
        <p>He spent nearly two years negotiating with A. Alfred Taubman, the former chairman of Sotheby's, about building a new home for the auction house with an apartment tower above it. As his plans evolved, Mr. Roth dropped Sotheby's in favor of its biggest rival, Christie's. Frustrated with Mr. Roth, Christie's ultimately moved to Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth eventually opened negotiations with Bloomberg and hired his fourth architect for the project. Earlier this year, the dormant site came alive when Mr. Roth started pouring the foundation for a skyscraper to try to beat the deadline for a proposed zoning change that would have permitted a building of only half the height he wanted.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Roth's talks with Bloomberg dragged on as the terms seemed to shift almost daily.</p>
        <p>In June, Mr. Roth seemed to be sending a bare-knuckled message to Bloomberg to accept his deal or else, when he filed preliminary plans for the tower with the City Buildings Department.</p>
        <p>The plans detailed only four floors of office space, instead of the six that Bloomberg needed. According to those who know him, Mr. Roth delighted in saying that in New York's booming real estate market, the site gained in value every day he failed to build anything.</p>
        <p>But it now appears that the two sides are striking a deal.</p>
        <p>''He's taken the gun out of his holster,'' said one investment banker who knows Mr. Roth well. ''Now he's got to pull the trigger.''</p>
