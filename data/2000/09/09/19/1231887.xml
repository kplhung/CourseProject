        <p>After rising steadily since the mid-1990's, the number of fatal accidents involving Ford Explorers with tire problems more than doubled last year, a trend that provides strong indications that the overall death toll from defective Firestone tires is higher than previously reported.</p>
        <p>An analysis by The New York Times of a newly released federal database of all fatal accidents across the country in 1999 shows that 52 people died in 40 fatal crashes of Explorers in which police reports listed tire problems as a contributing factor.</p>
        <p>Since Bridgestone/Firestone recalled 6.5 million of the tires in early August, amid a flood of lawsuits and customer complaints of treads that had literally peeled off the tires, federal highway safety regulators have said that at least 88 people were killed in accidents involving the tires since 1992, all but a handful in Ford Explorers. Twenty of those deaths were in 1999.</p>
        <p>Just how many of the new cases involved the combination of Explorers and Firestone tires may never be known, because the federal accident database does not specify the brand of tires used or precisely what failed.</p>
        <p>But in a spot check of police records and interviews with survivors, a large majority of the cases surveyed involved rollovers of Explorers with Firestone tires. At the same time, the analysis found that much of the increase in tire-related deaths could be accounted for by 1996 model Explorers equipped with Firestone tires. Officials of Ford Motor Company say that tires made for that model year had a particularly poor record of defects and warranty claims.</p>
        <p>Taken together, these factors suggest that the number of deaths linked to the Firestone tires is higher than previously known. And because tire problems usually surface after three or four years of use, the pattern suggests that the fatality rate is likely to continue into this year.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is planning to release a revised count, perhaps as early as today. But The Times's analysis shows that the percentage of fatal Ford Explorer accidents linked to tire problems began rising as early as 1995, and continued to rise steadily each year through 1998. Then last year, the number and rate of tire-related fatal Explorer accidents soared.</p>
        <p>In 1999, there were more than two and a half times the number of fatal tire-related accidents in Ford Explorers than the previous year and more than all earlier years combined. There were almost twice as many such accidents in Explorers as in all other sport utility vehicles built since the Explorer was introduced a decade ago, the analysis showed.</p>
        <p>Federal officials and industry executives have said that they are unable to detect the tire problem far in advance of the recall last month. But The Times analysis suggests that the trend could have been detected long before, if officials had used the federal fatality data as an early-warning system to identify possible manufacturing defects.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, top officials of Ford and Firestone have sparred publicly over how to share the blame for the problems.</p>
        <p>Asked about The Times's analysis, Ernie Grushz, Ford's manager of safety data analysis, said Ford's own analysis had shown that 1996 was a particularly bad year for Firestone tire manufacturing.</p>
        <p>''You don't see a tread separation in the first year or two and then you see a sharp spike,'' he said. ''In 1999 we are right in the hot zone. The increase simply shows that those Explorers were equipped with bad tires.''</p>
        <p>In 1995, when many of the tires for the 1996 Explorer were being made, Firestone was enduring a bitter strike that many workers say may have compromised quality at the company's plant in Decatur, Ill. Firestone officials admitted last week that the company had made ''bad tires,'' and said they were focusing on design issues, as well as manufacturing problems in Decatur.</p>
        <p>Asked about the new federal data, Daniel Adomitis, a spokesman for Firestone, said that the company had already recognized there was a problem with its tires.</p>
        <p>But he suggested further analysis needed to be done to examine why Ford Explorers rolled over, and he complained that Ford had declined to provide Firestone with its experience with tires produced by other manufacturers.</p>
        <p>The official federal count of Firestone deaths is based on complaints filed by lawyers and relatives of victims and on reports by Firestone itself, reviewed and released by the Highway Safety agency. The Times estimates are based on an analysis of a federal database of all 37,000 fatal accidents reported last year, compiled from police reports.</p>
        <p>Because the federal fatality data do not identify the tire manufacturer, The Times checked 25 cases across the country that appeared in the federal fatality database but were not listed in the official government count of deaths. It found that 19 of these cases involving 25 deaths were linked to Firestone tires; the others appeared to involve other tires or reporting errors.</p>
        <p>This count of cases would probably raise the official death count somewhat -- precisely how much is unclear because some of the complaints released by the Highway Traffic Safety agency were vague, and details of others were withheld.</p>
        <p>But if the same pattern held for all the cases, it would suggest about 78 deaths through 1999, along with an additional 21 deaths in the complaint file for this year, and additional accidents that have occurred since.</p>
        <p>In many cases the police reports examined by The Times described a high-speed rollover, produced by a separation of the tread from the tire. One typical accident last August killed the driver of a 1992 Explorer in New Mexico when the rubber of the Firestone tire's treads began peeling off at 70 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>A witness, Joe Sevier, who had just passed the Explorer, said: ''The tire separated and began throwing rubber off the road.''</p>
        <p>The report noted that: ''None of the tires were worn down to the tread bar or to wear indicators.''</p>
        <p>An earlier analysis by The Times showed that a fatal Explorer accident was nearly three times more likely to involve tires than other sport utility fatal accidents.</p>
        <p>The latest analysis, using data released only last week, shows that these patterns and differences became far more stark in 1999 -- when Explorer fatal accidents were more than six times as likely to have a tire-related problem as were other sport utility fatal accidents.</p>
        <p>The federal accident files are usually compiled by the end of May and then reviewed and made final by July. This year, they were not released until September. Rae Tyson, a spokesman from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said that the release was delayed to give federal analysts time to review the data and develop their own findings.</p>
        <p>They were released on Sept. 6, the same day that the agency's administrator, Sue Bailey, was called before Congress to testify about the Firestone recall and the agency's role in detecting tire safety problems.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Tyson and officials from Ford said that the fatality database was not now specific enough to draw concrete conclusions about specific mechanical defects.</p>
        <p>''It is not something that we would ever use as a first warning system,'' he said. ''It doesn't provide the degree of detail and specificity.''</p>
        <p>Even so, he said that federal investigators looking at the Firestone case were now reviewing records of fatalities in the federal database and going back to local police to seek more information about tire problems.</p>
        <p>The new data provide a stark and deteriorating portrait of tire safety in Explorers. Since 1995 there has been a steady increase in tire-related accidents in Ford Explorers, from 9 per 1,000 fatal Explorer accidents in 1995, to 11 in 1996 and 20 in 1997 and 25 in 1998, but last year the rate doubled to 52 per 1,000 accidents. Other utility vehicles of similar vintage had tire-related rates fluctuating around an average 6 per 1,000 fatal accidents during the period.</p>
        <p>There were 40 Explorer tire-related fatal accidents last year, compared to 23 for all other sport utility vehicles built since the Explorer was introduced with the 1991 model.</p>
        <p>In addition, the analysis showed that during several years when Ford Explorers were equipped with both Firestone and Goodyear Tires, Ford Explorers produced in plants using Firestone tires had many more fatalities than Explorers at plants using the other tires.</p>
        <p>In the 1996 model year, Ford said,  Firestone tires were installed on Ford Explorers in its plant outside St. Louis and Goodyear tires on its plant in Louisville, Ky.</p>
        <p>The data show that by the end of 1999, 18 fatal accidents involved 1996 Ford Explorers with tire problems that were produced at the St. Louis plant, while 3 involved vehicles assembled at the plant in Louisville.</p>
        <p>Ford officials said that in the following 1997 model year, they switched tire suppliers and installed Goodyear tires in the St. Louis plant and Firestone tires in the Louisville plant. All eight fatal accidents involving 1997 Explorers occurred in vehicles built at the Louisville plant, an analysis of vehicle identification numbers shows.</p>
        <p>The 1996 model year Explorers had more problems than any other year, 21 fatal accidents, compared to 5 for the 1995 model year and 8 for 1997. Ford officials, who analyzed warranty claims against Firestone, have concluded that tires produced in 1996 at Firestone's Decatur plant, had far more claims than any subsequent year, suggesting that production problems may have been particularly severe that year.</p>
        <p>The new data also document the role of hot weather and high speeds in the tire-related accidents. Forty percent of Ford Explorer tire-related fatal accidents occurred in the summer, compared to 28 percent for other Ford Explorer fatal accidents and 35 percent for tire-related accidents involving other sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>Fatal Ford Explorer tire accidents were also concentrated in warmer southern states, especially Texas, which had 18; Florida, 12; California, 10; and New Mexico and Georgia, which had 5 each. Where information on the speed of a vehicle was reported, the typical speed of a Ford Explorer in a fatal accident was 70 miles per hour.</p>
