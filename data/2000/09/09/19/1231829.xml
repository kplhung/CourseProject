        <p>A state judge warned officers of the Buffalo teachers' union yesterday that they would face trial on contempt charges if they failed to assure him that teachers would keep working while a state mediator developed a plan to reconcile the two sides of this month's teacher strike.</p>
        <p>The Buffalo Federation of Teachers has promised to stay in school only through today, when the mediator's proposal is expected. But in arraigning three leaders of the teachers' union on contempt charges yesterday, Justice Kevin M. Dillon warned in State Supreme Court that any further walkouts -- there were two within the last two weeks -- would mean harsher penalties. Public employee strikes are illegal in New York State.</p>
        <p>''What happens Wednesday is the big question,'' Paul G. Buchanan, president of the Buffalo Board of Education, said afterward. ''The judge is very concerned that there have been press reports over the weekend attributed to the union that everything is still day to day.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, public school students in Hamilton, N.J., went to class yesterday for the first time this fall, after a tentative agreement was reached Saturday after a nearly two-week walkout.</p>
        <p>In Buffalo, Philip Rumore, the union president; Edith LeWin, vice president; and Barbara Bielecki, secretary of the union, all pleaded not guilty to violating Justice Dillon's back-to-work order, issued last Tuesday. Justice Dillon said that he would schedule a trial for Thursday unless the teachers continued to work.</p>
