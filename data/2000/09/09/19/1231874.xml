        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Richard Rhodes has it right in his critique of violence on television and its effect on young viewers (Op-Ed, Sept. 17). Most children know the difference between fantasy and reality. It's the real violence that should concern us. The real role models for young men and boys are real men in sports and in their homes.</p>
        <p>We continue to train boys to be violent men by offering them highly paid athletes who fight, trash-talk  and assault officials.</p>

        <p>Richard Rhodes has it right in his critique of violence on television and its effect on young viewers (Op-Ed, Sept. 17). Most children know the difference between fantasy and reality. It's the real violence that should concern us. The real role models for young men and boys are real men in sports and in their homes.</p>
        <p>We continue to train boys to be violent men by offering them highly paid athletes who fight, trash-talk  and assault officials.</p>
        <p>Domestic violence is all too common. Our sons witness the violence and want to model the behavior of real men.</p>
        <p>So rather than look outside our homes for the cause of the violence in our young men and boys, try looking at how we encourage our sons to be violent, angry, competitive achievers who use violence as a means to an end.  ROBERT B. HARRIS  Lancaster, Calif., Sept. 17, 2000</p>
