        <p>Some scuba divers are at ease under the water but mighty uncomfortable on the diving boat. For help, they turn to over-the-counter seasickness medicines.</p>
        <p>This could be dangerous, a study says. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh say the drugs seem to affect some divers' mental functioning and judgment.</p>
        <p>The researchers, writing in the September issue of Pharmacotherapy, focus on two popular drugs: Dramamine, which helps with motion sickness, and Sudafed, which reduces pressure in the sinuses. They found no ill effects with Sudafed, but said Dramamine could be hazardous.</p>
        <p>Dramamine was the only motion-sickness drug studied, but Dr. Kevin O'Toole, one of the authors of the study, said similar over-the-counter remedies should probably also be avoided.</p>
        <p>''Although we can't say definitely about other types of drugs in that class,'' Dr. O'Toole said, ''because they are similar, and we know that most of them cause drowsiness, any of the drugs used for nausea of seasickness probably should not be used.''</p>
        <p>The researchers came to their conclusions after recruiting 30 people from diving clubs, giving them one of the two drugs or a placebo, and then placing them in a hyperbaric chamber. The chamber was used to simulate diving at depths of about 3 feet and again at about 66 feet.</p>
        <p>Researchers then measured the subjects' heart rates and rhythms, and gave them tests to gauge their mental acuity. It was on those tests that that the Dramamine users fared poorly.</p>
        <p>Dr. O'Toole said he did not think it was just the matter of the divers' drowsiness. It appeared, he said, to be a combination of the drug and the nitrogen that built up in the body during a dive.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Pharmacia, the company that makes Dramamine, said scientists there were reviewing the study, but she noted that the label warned users to be cautious because the drug causes drowsiness.</p>
