        <p>As far as anyone knew, Horace Clarke was not on the premises so a fellow Caribbean native would have to stand in for him. Luis Polonia did a wonderful imitation. He grounded a single over the mound, past Bartolo Colon -- ''it was hit too hard'' to grab it, the pitcher would say later -- and into center field in the eighth for the Yankees' first hit of the game.</p>
        <p>All right, so Clarke executed his no-hit trick in the ninth inning -- three times in the 1970 season -- but the Yankees couldn't be choosy. If they were going to avoid the first no-hitter against them since 1958 and the first against them at Yankee Stadium since 1952, Polonia's ground ball would do. It kept Colon from joining Hoyt Wilhelm and Virgil Trucks, among others, on that list that no team likes to keep.</p>

        <p>As far as anyone knew, Horace Clarke was not on the premises so a fellow Caribbean native would have to stand in for him. Luis Polonia did a wonderful imitation. He grounded a single over the mound, past Bartolo Colon -- ''it was hit too hard'' to grab it, the pitcher would say later -- and into center field in the eighth for the Yankees' first hit of the game.</p>
        <p>All right, so Clarke executed his no-hit trick in the ninth inning -- three times in the 1970 season -- but the Yankees couldn't be choosy. If they were going to avoid the first no-hitter against them since 1958 and the first against them at Yankee Stadium since 1952, Polonia's ground ball would do. It kept Colon from joining Hoyt Wilhelm and Virgil Trucks, among others, on that list that no team likes to keep.</p>
        <p>So Polonia was a hero among his teammates. He was traitor at the same time. Natives of the Dominican Republic, Polonia and Colon, the young hard-throwing Cleveland pitcher, have been friends since they were teammates in the Dominican winter league in 1993. The next time they face each other, Colon will bounce one off Polonia's noggin, right?</p>
        <p>''That's part of the game,'' Colon said. ''He has to do his job.'' And, he added, when they next see each other, the pitcher will give the tiny outfielder a big hug.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the next time they see each other could be the first round of the playoffs, East Division champion Yankees vs. wild-card Indians. After the past two games, the Yankees have to wonder about that matchup.</p>
        <p>Chuck Finley, the modern-day Yankee killer, holds them hitless into the fifth inning Sunday while his bat-swinging teammates are beating up on the Yankees pitchers, and last night Colon holds them to one hit in a 2-0 victory. It wasn't just that Colon allowed the Yankees only one hit; it was the way he did it. They couldn't see the ball, he was throwing it so hard.</p>
        <p>Juiced balls? These must have been invisible. Colon struck out 13, and eight of those batters took the third strike without trying to hit it. Colon finished with a flourish, striking out all three batters he faced in the ninth. Derek Jeter, who lined a shot off the pitcher's left hip in the first inning, only to have Colon throw him out at first, took a third strike for the last pitch of the game.</p>
        <p>''He had a nasty, nasty slider,'' an admiring scout said. ''The last pitch to Jeter fell off the table.''</p>
        <p>According to the ever-present radar guns, Colon threw three pitches (five, according to another scout) at 100 miles an hour, seven at 99, 12 at 98, 19 at 97. If he had thrown those pitches past the night-time construction lane on the George Washington Bridge, he would have been fined double the regular amount.</p>
        <p>''I always can throw hard,'' he said matter of factly through a translator. ''I don't even think about it.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees will surely think about it for the next two weeks. After having beaten Pedro Martinez in Boston recently, they might even prefer facing him in the playoffs. The Indians and the Red Sox will have a large input into which team, if either, wins the wild-card spot. They play each other five times in the next three days at Fenway Park, sort of like those old-time bareknuckle brawls, last man standing wins.</p>
        <p>Colon has pitched against the Yankees four times in his brief career, three times as a starter. He has allowed them two earned runs in 26 innings for a 0.69 earned run average. Pedro, were are you?</p>
        <p>The Yankees hit a few balls that could have been hits, but Colon's hip got in the way of one of the balls, Jim Thome's glove got in the way of two others wide of first base and Kenny Lofton's leaping body intercepted one as it was about to go into orbit beyond the center field fence.</p>
        <p>''The guys helped me,'' the humble 25-year-old said. ''I had a lot of support. If I was going to do it, it was going to be because of them.''</p>
        <p>Colon, who said he had been ''charged'' by the large Latin contingent in the stands, was asked if he was nervous. ''I was a little nervous in the eighth inning,'' he said. ''When Polonia got that hit, I felt it was like a punch in the chest.''</p>
        <p>He tried to throw the fastball in on Polonia, Colon said, ''but it came out and he got it; he's a good hitter.''</p>
        <p>''I felt bad,'' he added, talking about losing his no-hit bid, ''but I know he's got to do his job, as I did.''</p>
        <p>After the hit, second baseman Roberto Alomar went to the mound and talked to the pitcher briefly. ''Just keep throwing,'' the veteran told the youngster. ''Pitch your game. Forget about it. Let's go.''</p>
        <p>Colon said he didn't think he could pitch any better than he had in the previous couple of hours, calling it his best game.</p>
        <p>But who's to say there isn't another one in his right arm set to go off the first week of next month?</p>
        <p>Might the Yankees be intimidated by this performance? ''I think not,'' Colon said, ''because they're great and they're one of the best clubs in the game. They're always going to be tough.''</p>
        <p>But this game won't be easy to put out of their minds. Nor out of Colon's mind.</p>
        <p>''I will never forget this game,'' he said, ''or the line drive off the hip.''</p>
