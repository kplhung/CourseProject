        <p>The family of the 18-year-old whose death in a gene therapy experiment at the University of Pennsylvania started a debate about medical research filed a wrongful death lawsuit today against the university and five doctors, including a prominent medical ethicist.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed in state court in Philadelphia, one year and one day after the young man, Jesse Gelsinger, died. It accuses the doctors of failing to follow federal rules governing medical experiments and failing to properly inform Mr. Gelsinger of the risks.</p>

        <p>The family of the 18-year-old whose death in a gene therapy experiment at the University of Pennsylvania started a debate about medical research filed a wrongful death lawsuit today against the university and five doctors, including a prominent medical ethicist.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed in state court in Philadelphia, one year and one day after the young man, Jesse Gelsinger, died. It accuses the doctors of failing to follow federal rules governing medical experiments and failing to properly inform Mr. Gelsinger of the risks.</p>
        <p>The suit named not only the three doctors involved in the study -- James M. Wilson, Steven Raper and  Mark Batshaw -- but also Dr. William M. Kelley, the former dean of the university's medical school, and Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, director of the university's Center for Bioethics.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kelley is a gene therapy expert who, the lawsuit said, would have gained financially through patent royalties if the experiment had succeeded. Dr. Caplan advised the researchers on the ethics of the study.</p>
