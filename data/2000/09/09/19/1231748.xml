        <p>IT wasn't the first time Esther Kim had given her hand to Kay Poe in a moment of urgent need. Eleven years of friendship, of virtual sisterhood, began with that very gesture, with a touching demonstration of compassion.</p>
        <p>Esther was only 9 years old when her father sent the new girl over, in a Ninja mask that failed to hide a set of apprehensive eyes. It was the Halloween party at Jin Won Kim's tae kwondo school in Houston, and Kay, merely 7 herself, wouldn't remove the mask after having her long, sandy-colored hair cut short.</p>
        <p>She stood in front of Esther, Master Kim's daughter, who was costumed in a pirate suit. And all these years later, mixing giggles with vivid detail, they could recreate the memory of the Korean-American girl clasping the hand of the Caucasian girl, leading her around the room and into a story that is now resonating worldwide.</p>
        <p>''I actually didn't know if she was a girl or a boy because all I could see was her eyes,'' Esther said. ''But after she slipped her hand in mine, we were inseparable.''</p>
        <p>Just how close became a matter of public record and a badly needed tonic for a tainted Olympic ideal, after Esther forfeited her flyweight-division final to her injured friend at the United States taekwondo trials in Colorado Springs last May. Reporters called from around the country after hearing of what Esther had done for her best friend. Youth groups called. Oprah called. Juan Antonio Samaranch, the embattled and outgoing president of the International Olympic Committee, was on the international line one morning to invite a sleepy Esther and her father, who had coached both girls, here to Sydney as his guests.</p>
        <p>Naturally, because these days there inevitably must be a more cynical lesson beyond those Esther learned from her father, there were questions at yesterday's news conference regarding the incongruity of such selflessness in a world-class athlete. Just what did it say that Esther had let emotion obscure her ultimate goal, or stepped aside for the competitor who rated a greater gold medal chance?</p>
        <p>No one, thankfully, cared to extrapolate on whether this was a show of female weakness or strength. But a grown man, Esther's father, cried while recalling how his daughter had summoned him to say she could not fight her friend in the trials final after Kay had dislocated her left kneecap in the previous match.</p>
        <p>For all the generalizations, it comes down to how we define success, and how far we are willing to go to achieve it. Here at the Olympics, we encounter drug cheats of either sex who get thrown out, not to mention those who manage to sneak by. For the sake of stark and sobering contrast, Americans can be particularly proud of our Greco-Roman entrant in the 167.5-pound class. Matt Lindland's refusal to accept an honestly officiated trials final precipitated several bouts of wrestling with various courts that ultimately cost his opponent an Olympic position he had earned.</p>
        <p>Jin Won Kim was making no judgments, no comparisons, to other people in other sports. He emigrated to the United States from Seoul, South Korea, in 1974, and opened his school two years later. He raised his daughter on the values of a martial art that involves striking opponents with hands and feet, while practicing self-discipline and self-defense. One of his favorite words is ''understand'' because, as he said, ''under'' and ''stand'' together present a formula for ''people being very, very happy,'' for giving respect before you receive it.</p>
        <p>''Our society,'' he said, ''has so much problems of people trying to stay on top.''</p>
        <p>When Esther told him she would cede the final to Kay, he said, ''Esther, do you know what you're giving up?'' She said she did, and he said he was shocked, but it was the bewilderment one feels after learning of a winning lottery ticket.</p>
        <p>''This is the philosophy of tae kwondo that I believe,'' he said, and why, after composing himself at the trials, he told his daughter, ''You are a champion for life.''</p>
        <p>He ascribes to an older, stricter doctrine but acknowledged that there were modernistic versions that were less pure. No doubt he has come across his share of the same family pressure and outright dysfunction that exists in more traditional youth sports.</p>
        <p>In the final analysis, Esther applied what her father taught her in what was essentially a family situation. Both women consider the other a sister. Kay has told Jin Won Kim that she considers him a ''second father.'' What father, biological or not, wouldn't consider himself eternally blessed after watching his child give so much for a younger sibling?</p>
        <p>Kay said she couldn't really say if she would have made the same sacrifice for Esther -- a wonderfully honest admission in itself. She just didn't know if she would have turned to Esther and said: ''This is something I don't want to argue about. I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.'' Then again, Kay is the kid sister.</p>
        <p>Esther's standard is not one to hold others to, as much as it is one everyone can aspire to. On leave this year from the University of Houston, she was here to watch her friend march in the opening ceremony last Friday night. She will be right next to her father, in the stands, when the competition begins next week. She doesn't know if she will try for Athens in four years, but in 10 years, she is certain she will have no regrets about what she gave up here.</p>
        <p>''It feels right, in my heart,'' Esther said. She believes that Kay will be stronger, fighting for two, and carrying a piece of her heart to the mat. Which means this time, her best friend received more than a hand. It means she already has gold.</p>
