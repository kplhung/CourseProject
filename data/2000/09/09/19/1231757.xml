        <p>There is a type of picture postcard that vacationers in tropical resorts love to send, especially to friends in colder climes.

Exuding warmth and giddiness, these kitschy images usually do just what they're supposed to do: they make the postcards' recipients smile despite themselves.</p>

        <p>There is a type of picture postcard that vacationers in tropical resorts love to send, especially to friends in colder climes. The colors in the landscapes are brightened to the point of luridness; the people shown always look happy, sexy and silly. Exuding warmth and giddiness, these kitschy images usually do just what they're supposed to do: they make the postcards' recipients smile despite themselves.</p>
        <p>Seeing ''4 Guys Named Jose . . . and una Mujer Named Maria!'' is rather like getting one of those postcards. This chipper, very likable musical revue, which opened last night at the Blue Angel Theater, unfolds its anthology of popular Latin songs with the hardworking, instructional friendliness of a tour guide.</p>
        <p>Directed with bounce and calculating shrewdness by Susana Tubert, the show aspires to being neither cool nor hot. It aims instead at a genial, family-oriented warmth. In the opening number, the singers promise an evening with ''no knives, no drugs, no cape . . . man.'' (Ms. Tubert was among the discarded directors on Paul Simon's ill-fated Latino musical, ''Cape Man.'') The five appealing performers pleasantly recall a pre-ironic time when perkiness was considered a virtue. It was the age of the ''New Faces'' revues and early television variety shows.</p>
        <p>In other ways, ''4 Guys,'' which was conceived by David Coffman and Dolores Prida, is very much of the moment, especially given the hype for the brand new Latin Grammy Awards show last week. (For the record, one of the producers of ''4 Guys'' is the singing star Enrique Iglesias.) Like the awards presentation, which was internationally televised, ''4 Guys'' pitches itself at both Latinos, who would presumably be familiar with much of its material, and (in the words of the show) ''monolinguist'' English speakers. A performer accordingly salutes the audience with the prefatory words, ''Ladies and gentlemen, Latinos y gringos.''</p>
        <p>This double focus inevitably results in a certain didacticism. The evening features several teaching sequences, including a throwaway introduction to beat-making percussion instruments and a quick language lesson that explains how the only words you really need to know here have to do with love and desire. The breeziness of the staging mostly erases the taste of ''Sesame Street.''</p>
        <p>There is also, nominally, a plot. Ms. Prida's consciously corny book presents four Latino men who band together to put on a show in midwinter in Omaha at the local veterans' hall. They have had ''only their songs to keep them warm,'' as one of them puts it. Well, until the appearance of a curvaceous singer who joins the show at the last minute and is, in the tradition of old movie musicals, word perfect.</p>
        <p>Lissette Gonzalez plays this late arrival with a comic gusto that captures the evening's overall tone. A former Miss Florida (and a runner-up to Miss America), she is a bombshell beauty with the face-splitting grin of Julia Roberts. She is also possessed of a rubbery expressiveness that doesn't shy from mugging in the manner of Lucille Ball. This sweetens her sexuality without altogether sanitizing it, and her admirable singing and dancing present passion with a light-handed polish.</p>
        <p>The same can be said of her fellow performers: Philip Anthony, Henry Gainza, Allen Hidalgo and Ricardo Puente. The men are of varying shape, age and size, just as their characters are meant to be of different national backgrounds. Like the Latin Grammys, ''4 Guys'' is careful to present a generous spirit of inclusiveness, a sensibility at which it manages to poke gentle fun before the evening's end.</p>
        <p>More important to the show's success, however, is the emergence of each performer as a strong individual presence. This was the lesson so effectively demonstrated by ''Ain't Misbehavin,' '' the celebrated Fats Waller revue on which Dasha Epstein, a co-producer here, served the same role. ''4 Guys'' isn't on that high level, but it has the strength of vividly defined personalities in a way more homogenized revues like ''Fosse'' and ''Swing!'' do not.</p>
        <p>The songs, arranged by Oscar Hernandez and seamlessly performed by a three-member band, have been astutely selected both as solo showcases and as audience-grabbing ensemble pieces, jauntily choreographed by Maria Torres. The numbers include homages to well-known crossover Latino artists, from Carmen Miranda and Desi Arnaz to Santana, Ricky Martin and (not incidentally) Enrique Iglesias.</p>
        <p>There are also songs of heartbreak and lamentation, an assortment of serenades and a lovely series of nostalgic ballads to the native lands of the show's transplanted characters: the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Cuba. These are crooned by the four men in Spanish (with brief, unobtrusive spoken English translations in between) with dulcet tones and brimming eyes.</p>
        <p>The show then delivers a surprising series of revelations that suggest that being Latino is never a clear-cut matter. Ms. Prida's book for the show has moments of cloying cuteness, and the performers don't always resist the temptation to oversell themselves.</p>
        <p>But by the evening's end, you realize that the show has had more on its mind that at first seemed apparent. Of course, you're less likely to leave ''4 Guys'' contemplating cultural identity than twitching your shoulders to the memory of irresistible rhythms.</p>
