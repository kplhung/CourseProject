        <p>The precise geographical middle of America is hundreds of miles to the south and west of here. The media capitals of the country are on the far-off Atlantic and Pacific Coasts. But as far as marketing presidential candidacies is concerned, this is the nation's epicenter.</p>
        <p>Or at the very least, one of a handful of video ground zeros in states identified by both sides as crucial battlegrounds. For weeks, the campaigns have rained electronic messages on Detroit. Hour after hour, day after day, commercial time on local stations in this city of one million has been consumed by political advertising with an intensity that Democrats and Republicans here agree is unmatched in Michigan history.</p>
        <p>Pro-Gore. Anti-Gore. Pro-Bush. Anti-Bush. Commercials by parties and special interest groups praising the contenders for their positions on education and Social Security and attacking them for their positions on education and Social Security. Add to the media mix a fiercely competitive United States Senate race and a bevy of aggressively contested state contests and ballot questions, and the television dial seems tuned to a schedule of all political commercials all the time.</p>
        <p>''It's unprecedented at the presidential level,'' said Rusty Hills, chairman of the Michigan State Republican Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hills's Democratic counterpart, Mark Brewer, said, ''I've been in politics for 20 years here, and I've never seen this level of saturation in the media, and certainly never so much this early.''</p>
        <p>So many spots in so many races compete for air space that officials  say they would not be surprised if by November the total advertising price tag here exceeded $10 million.</p>
        <p>This media thicket makes it tough for any candidate to get a coherent message out to voters. But pollsters here say that Vice President Al Gore appears to have had more success. The latest Michigan surveys give him a marginal lead over Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the pollsters assert that a contributing factor is that the Gore spots emphasizing the candidate's stands on specific issues have played better than Republican commercials questioning Mr. Gore's integrity.</p>
        <p>''The Bush ads are more thematic,'' said Ed Sarpolus of the EPIC/MRA polling firm, in Lansing, ''and when I look at them, knowing who's on the line here, people want substance, not themes.''</p>
        <p>''The voter today wants to know what your decisions are and how you make them,'' Mr. Sarpolus added. ''If you look at the Gore approach, you notice a lot more of that. Bush has yet to explain any of that.''</p>
        <p>The nonstop electioneering has ushered in a new Michigan malady: ad fatigue. ''They keep shoving them down your throat,'' Bob Johnson, a retiree from Houghton Lake, Mich., said. ''I just can't sit there and watch them anymore.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Johnson, a political independent, said he was impressed with Mr. Gore's television campaign and was inclined to support him. ''I don't think he's mudslinging as much as Bush is,'' he said, adding that for Mr. Bush to win his vote, ''he'd have to start talking about the issues more, and getting off Gore's back.''</p>
        <p>Some other voters interviewed in Ann Arbor and Detroit acknowledged the spots have made a difference. ''Back in January and February, it seemed that Bush was a stronger candidate, but now I'm leaning towards Gore,'' said James Ambrose, a Detroit photographer. ''Seeing Gore presented in the persona of a respectable figure in advertisements has swayed my opinion.''</p>
        <p>But Peter O'Grady, a Bush supporter from Ann Arbor, said he enjoyed the Republican spots that criticized Mr. Gore, particularly one that cited the vice president's assertions that he was instrumental in the development of the Internet.'' Mr. O'Grady called that spot hilarious.</p>
        <p>What makes the battle of the airwaves here all the more unusual is that while Detroiters and their counterparts in other heavily targeted markets like Philadelphia, St. Louis and Milwaukee are being subjected to large daily doses of Gore and Bush advertisements, voters in other cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Houston, see virtually none. That is because in June, when the general-election advertising got seriously under way, the political parties picked 15 to 17 states -- including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Missouri and Wisconsin -- in which they believed the election would be decided.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' national commercials began running in those battleground states on June 8; the Republicans responded in kind a few days later. And aside from some fine tuning -- adding a few more states, or shifting resources from one part of a state to another -- the strategies and chosen states have remained remarkably consistent all summer.</p>
        <p>Vast amounts of money are being poured into those states by the campaigns, the parties and groups like Handgun Control and the Sierra Club. Strategists on both sides say that in the month since the Democratic convention, the campaigns and parties have spent at least $2.5 million in Detroit alone, in a national media campaign that has already hit the $100 million mark.</p>
        <p>Because of the campaigns' desire to protect their media strategy, it is difficult to get a full accounting of how and where they spend their money. According to figures provided by senior Gore officials and the Democratic Party, the Bush and Gore campaigns and both parties have bought a total of nearly $60 million in television time for the period of Aug. 21 to Sept. 24, with the largest amounts for both sides being spent in  Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Florida.</p>
        <p>Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the growing sophistication of polling and other research had allowed strategists to pinpoint pivotal markets with more precision than in the past. ''In 1996 it was more national: targeted but not as specific,'' Mr. Andrew said of the party's advertising. This year, he explained, ''We determined what the targeted states were, we went up on the air fast, and we have stuck with our plan.''</p>
        <p>It is as if the 2000 presidential campaign were being offered on two television channels: one for those 17 states and a few overlapping markets in others, in which the electronic campaign is omnipresent; another for the 33 states where advertising is an afterthought.</p>
        <p>In Detroit, one of the largest markets in the core group of Midwestern industrial swing states, political spots flash across the screen in an endless video parade.</p>
        <p>On a recent weekday, a viewer channel-surfing the newscasts and other programs between 6 p.m. and 6:30 p.m., a peak half-hour for political spots, turned up 17 of the commercials on local affiliates of ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. Attacks outpaced embraces. One spot running frequently here by the Republican National Committee suggests shady dealings by Mr. Gore. ''Because of Gore's last fund-raising campaign,'' the announcer says as the vice president's face appears on a television screen-within-a-screen, ''22 people have been indicted, 12 convicted, 70 took the Fifth Amendment and 18 witnesses fled the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush comes in for his share of knocks from Gore partisans as well. In a blistering piece by Handgun Control that ran on several channels, the voiceover gives the impression that the United States will resort to frontier justice if the governor wins the White House.</p>
        <p>''Say no to the gun lobby,'' the announcer says. ''Tell George Bush handguns don't belong in our nursing homes and churches.''</p>
        <p>But the commercials that appear to be clicking with voters are those that stake out an issue and provide at least a light coat of detail and warmth. Mr. Bush, for example, is frequently running an advertisement promoting his prescription drug plan, while Mr. Gore has a spot on the air here in which a grateful mother tells how the vice president persuaded an insurer not to cut off benefits for her chronically ill little boy.</p>
        <p>Jerry Herron, director of the American Studies program at Wayne State University, said that these types of commercials were what he recalled. ''The spots that I've seen on TV are where we're getting the serious social agenda,'' he said. ''At least in Detroit, they are doing a heavy thumping on traditional Democratic issues.''</p>
        <p>There are those who say Michigan is fortunate to be the object of the advertising buyers' affection. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said her studies show that voters who live in states with intensive media campaigns learn more about the candidates than those who do not.</p>
        <p>''When many of us are deprived of the intense campaigning,'' she said, ''we've moved from a democracy to a situation where we have delegated the responsibility to others to become knowledgeable for us.''</p>
        <p>Some Detroiters look forward to that sort of deprivation. ''They're really repetitive,'' said Erika Hauff, a former store manager. ''It seems like the commercials are targeted to people who want a quick, easy answer to things.''</p>
        <p>And viewers like Alicia Densemo, a secretary at a Detroit vocational center, say they have been bombarded with all the images and sound bites they will ever need. ''I'll be glad,'' she said, ''when this is over.''</p>
