        <p>The White House expressed alarm today at the possibility that Congress might provide money to the states to help low-income elderly people buy prescription drugs, as Gov. George W. Bush has proposed. Administration officials said such an approach was unworkable.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, issued a study criticizing the proposal to subsidize pharmacy assistance programs run by the states. Mr. Jennings said President Clinton would not accept any pharmaceutical plan unless it offered drug coverage, through Medicare, for all 39 million Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>The report attacks the approach favored by Mr. Bush and by Senate Republicans including Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader; Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader, and William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, introduced by Mr. Roth, states could use federal money to provide assistance to Medicare beneficiaries with annual incomes up to 75 percent above the poverty level -- up to $14,600 for individuals and $19,700 for couples.</p>
        <p>The White House said that in 40 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, at least 70 percent of the elderly would be ineligible for assistance under Mr. Roth's plan.</p>
        <p>Nearly five million people would be excluded because they are eligible for Medicaid, Mr. Jennings said, and an additional 20 million ''would be excluded because their incomes exceed the eligibility level.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the White House said, even those who enroll in state programs might be subject to limits on the number of prescriptions or the types of drugs they could obtain.</p>
        <p>At least 22 states have or have authorized programs to help low-income elderly people buy prescription drugs. But the White House said that fewer than 850,000 people participated and that many elderly people were reluctant to enroll because they had to sign up in welfare offices.</p>
        <p>The administration appears to have two major fears. It worries that Republicans will push their proposal through Congress, so Mr. Clinton would be in the awkward position, just before Election Day, of vetoing a bill to help the elderly with drug costs. In addition, Mr. Jennings said, officials worry that a limited assistance program, intended for low-income people, will undermine efforts to provide more comprehensive, more generous benefits as a standard part of Medicare.</p>
        <p>Ginny Flynn, a spokesman for Mr. Roth, said today's White House offensive showed that the administration was ''not interested in getting anything done on this issue'' this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth will soon ask the Finance Committee to approve legislation increasing Medicare payments to health care providers.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 23, 2000, Saturday  An article on Thursday about a health care policy adviser to Gov. George W. Bush who has financial ties to eight health care companies referred incorrectly to her ownership of 16,000 options on shares in United Health Care, of which she is a director. The adviser, Dr. Gail R. Wilensky, sold the shares in May at a profit of $328,144; she does not still hold them.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the name of one company in which Dr. Wilensky holds an interest. It is St. Jude Medical Inc., not St. Jude Medical Care.</p>
