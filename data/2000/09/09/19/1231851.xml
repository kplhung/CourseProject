        <p>A New Jersey Transit bus driver passed out as he was driving through a rural stretch of South Jersey yesterday morning, and his bus veered  across the highway, rolled down a small embankment and crashed into a house.</p>
        <p>The driver was found dead in the wreckage, and three of his seven passengers suffered minor injuries, the state police said. The house was unoccupied at the time.</p>
        <p>The bus was traveling from Philadelphia to the resort community of Cape May. The crash occurred in Dennis Township, about 20 miles north of Cape May.</p>
        <p>The driver, James R. Rapp, 49, of Blackwood, N.J., was chatting with a  passenger about 9 a.m. when he appeared to pass out and slump sideways in his seat, said Sgt. Al Della Fave, a spokesman for the state police. The bus left the southbound lanes of Route 47, crossed a grassy median and the highway's northbound lanes, then plunged into the living room of the two-story house, which was about 40 feet from the road.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Della Fave said it was not clear yesterday if Mr. Rapp died in the crash or before the bus ran off the highway. He said an autopsy was scheduled for today.</p>
        <p>Teresa Turchi, 18, said she was watching television when she heard the crash at her neighbors' house. After she called 911, she ran to the house. The driver was lying in the stairwell of the bus. Screaming passengers were climbing through a hatch in the roof of the bus.</p>
        <p>Ms. Turchi said one passenger suggested that Mr. Rapp might have had a heart attack. She said the passenger told her he had ''grabbed his heart.''</p>
        <p>The house's owner, Paula Guzinsky, 36, and her boyfriend, William Boney, 31, had left for work about 8 a.m. Ms. Guzinsky's two sons, ages 11 and 13, were in school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rapp had driven buses for New Jersey Transit since 1974 and had an ''impeccable driving record,'' said Anna Farneski, a spokeswoman for the agency, which operates New Jersey's commuter trains and buses. Citing employees' privacy, she would not discuss his medical history or the results of a routine, state-mandated physical examination he received in December.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rapp did not have any known medical problems that made him unfit to drive a bus, said Dana Sullivan, a spokesman for the New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles. Mr. Sullivan said division officials routinely check the results of medical exams given to commercial and school bus drivers in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rapp had left Philadelphia at 6:30 a.m. for the three-and-a-half-hour trip. Ms. Farneski said he had reported for work at 5:55 a.m. in good spirits. ''He didn't say anything about feeling ill,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She said Mr. Rapp had a reputation as a diligent worker who was  chatty and cheerful with his passengers.</p>
        <p>His bus was last inspected on Sept. 2 and found in good working condition, with no defects, she said.</p>
