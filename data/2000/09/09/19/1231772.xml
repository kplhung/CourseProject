        <p>The ratings picture for NBC's coverage of the Sydney Olympics grew much cloudier over the weekend as first Saturday's and then Sunday's numbers came up well short of what the network had scored for the past two foreign-based Olympics.</p>
        <p>NBC's Sunday rating, a 14.6, was most alarming for the network because it was the lowest Sunday night rating for Olympic coverage in at least 20 years.

        <p>The ratings picture for NBC's coverage of the Sydney Olympics grew much cloudier over the weekend as first Saturday's and then Sunday's numbers came up well short of what the network had scored for the past two foreign-based Olympics.</p>
        <p>NBC's Sunday rating, a 14.6, was most alarming for the network because it was the lowest Sunday night rating for Olympic coverage in at least 20 years. It was also the night that network began its coverage of women's gymnastics, always among the highest-rated events of an Olympics. (Each rating point represents just over 1 million homes.)</p>
        <p>Saturday night averaged a 13.6 rating. The network has set an average rating of 17.5 as a prime-time target, and for the first three nights the coverage stands at just a 14.5. That figure is 10 percent below the average for the games both at Barcelona in 1992 and Seoul in 1988. It is 32 percent below what the network scored in Atlanta four years ago, but NBC dismissed the comparison because those Games were held on American soil.</p>
