        <p>THIS is a nation that loves swimming  and not just cooling off in the backyard pool and not just swimming laps so you can go out and eat a dish of linguine without feeling guilty.</p>
        <p>This is a nation that glorifies competitive swimmers. Gives them nicknames like, well, like Thorpedo for a mellow youth named Ian Thorpe.</p>
        <p>The big swimmer of the generation is recognized when he goes out on the town for a few hours with nearly the same frenzy that Jordan receives in the States and Gretzky gets in Canada. Look, there's Thorpedo. Who's he with?</p>
        <p>Australians put a lot of national identity into their swimmers, particularly when the Summer Games are held in the placid waters of Homebush Bay, where the pool has been engineered to minimize the waves and the heat has been raised and the chlorine has been lowered, just to give swimmers the extra edge.</p>
        <p>This isn't some funny sport that comes around once every four years into the distracted field of vision of American sports fans. Over here, Thorpedo is very huge for 19 million people. For weeks and months he was the great wet hope, the wonder boy who would win all the medals.</p>
        <p>Everybody knows his story -- the kid brother who followed his sister into the pool, the boy with the size 17 feet who can't run or catch very well, the friend who willed his best pal to want to keep living after being struck by non-Hodgkins lymphoma. In America, people look for bad attitude in their stars. Even when he spoke of feeling like ''a gladiator'' after winning a gold over the weekend, Thorpe antagonized nobody.</p>
        <p>Now Ian Thorpe is doing even better. He is an inspiration to every runner who didn't quite touch home plate, every receiver who was tackled just shy of the end zone. Better than showing Australia how to win, Ian Thorpe showed Australia -- and all the swaggering, multimillionaire big shots back in the States -- how to handle one bad race.</p>
        <p>He never carried the weight of the nation on his shoulders. His first two gold medals of these Games raised hopes for Australians that this might be one epic week in the pool. But the expectations were not the reason this calm kid, wise beyond his years, finished second to Pieter van den Hoogenband in the biggest swimming race of these Summer Games.</p>
        <p>In the 200-meter freestyle last night, van den Hoogenband tied the world record of 1 minute 45.35 seconds he had set the night before. Ian Thorpe finished second in 1:45.83. That is to say, in this sport of decimal points, it wasn't even that close.</p>
        <p>Whoosh. You could hear the lungs collapse, the souffle sag, the wine curdle. But Ian Thorpe would not lament the chance to dominate these Games forever.</p>
        <p>''You have to be happy with what you do,'' Thorpe said later. ''I'm happy with the result. I gave it my best shot. I'm disappointed in the time, but not the result.''</p>
        <p>This was his race. This was his pool. This is his country. Did he feel badly knowing somebody else touched the wall first?</p>
        <p>''No, not at all,'' Thorpe said. ''Every athlete comes here to compete. It is a privilege to compete in the Olympics. It is an opportunity very few people ever have. I'm enjoying every minute of it.''</p>
        <p>He shrugged off the question about whether the national pressure had gotten to him. ''Pressure can stretch you,'' he said. ''I have expectations for myself -- and mine are higher than anybody else's. But a great athlete beat me. The support we have here is phenomenal. I wouldn't be here without the support.''</p>
        <p>He agreed that he might have been weary from having already won two races, plus the heats. He said, ''I never liked the program, but everybody has to swim the same program.''</p>
        <p>What did he say to van den Hoogenband in the water after the race? ''I congratulated Pieter on a great swim by him,'' Thorpe said. ''I told him to enjoy it.''</p>
        <p>So should the whole country. This is not one of those perceived national disgraces, losing on home ground, or home waters or home ice. This is not the Netherlands losing on penalty kicks to Italy in the recent European soccer semifinals, or the United States losing the America's Cup of sailing to Australia off Rhode Island in 1983. This is not Team Canada losing two, tying one and winning one in the first four games of ice hockey's groundbreaking Summit Series against the visiting Soviet Union in 1972. This is not the Orioles losing to Cuba in Baltimore a year ago.</p>
        <p>This is a good kid who had a bad half-second. Australia will get over it. Ian Thorpe already has.</p>
