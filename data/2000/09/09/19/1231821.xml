        <p>Unnerved by the Ford Motor Company's decision last week to abandon a takeover of the ailing Daewoo Motor Company, investors sold off South Korean securities today, pulling the stock market here to an 18-month low.</p>
        <p>Ford's decision on Friday to walk away from Daewoo -- without offering a lower price than the original $6.9 billion it bid -- was an unexpectedly heavy blow that both reduced chances of salvaging the company and sent something of a no-confidence message about the nation's economic recovery.</p>
        <p>Daewoo Motor carries at least $18 billion in debt and is continuing to lose money. The Daewoo group of companies has at least $80 billion in debt. A new effort to find a buyer for Daewoo Motor will now begin, and Korean banks face the prospect of spending more money to keep the company alive.</p>
        <p>In trading today, South Korea's benchmark stock index, which fell 3.4 percent on Friday in reaction to the Ford news, fell harder still in aggressive selling. The index was down as much as 12 percent, causing a 20-minute trading halt, before rebounding somewhat to close 8 percent lower at 577.56, the weakest level since March 1999.</p>
        <p>Other Asian markets worsened their losses as well with Hong Kong down 4.2 percent; Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan each losing about 2 percent; and Indonesia, plagued by political instability and uncertainty about its banking system, shedding 7 percent.</p>
        <p>Referring to Daewoo, Kim Dae Shik, an economics professor at Chung Ang University, said: ''This is a major crisis. With Ford dropping its bid, nothing has been achieved in terms of restructuring at the Daewoo group, and restarting the sales process means creditor banks must provide more working capital. This will hamper crucial bank industry restructuring.''</p>
        <p>The heavy selling of stocks also helped push the South Korean currency, the won, down to its weakest level since June. By late today, it took 1,131 won to buy $1, compared with 1,119.80 won on Friday. Investor anxiety also pushed up the average yield on bellwether three-year corporate bonds to 9.06 percent from 8.96 percent on Friday. Three-year government bonds jumped to 8.11 percent from 7.92 percent.</p>
        <p>In a June auction, Ford beat out two rivals, General Motors and the Hyundai Motor Company, to buy Daewoo, the biggest sale of a South Korean company to a foreign investor. Ford viewed the acquisition as an important part of its strategy to expand in Asia. For Daewoo and its parent, the sale would have raised much-needed capital to repay debts.</p>
        <p>With the sale process back to Square 1, creditors of Daewoo Motor called on four automakers to resubmit their bids. Seeking to prevent any more delays, the government-owned Korea Development Bank, Hanvit Bank and three other main creditors set Oct. 20 as a deadline to complete the sale.</p>
        <p>G.M., which teamed up with Fiat in its earlier bid for Daewoo, has said it is still interested, while stressing the decline in value of the Korean carmaker. DaimlerChrysler, which made a joint bid with Hyundai, has said it is not interested in any part of Daewoo Motor.</p>
