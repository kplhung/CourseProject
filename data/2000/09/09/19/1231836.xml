        <p>Antitrust regulators at the European Commission are threatening to block the $165 billion merger of Time Warner and America Online, as both sides prepare to negotiate a possible settlement over the next week.</p>
        <p>European officials in Brussels have drawn up proposed rejection language, according to a person close to the discussions, arguing that the merger could choke off competition in the distribution of music and entertainment over the Internet.</p>
        <p>The move by the European Commission, the day-to-day administrative arm of the European Union, is to a great extent procedural and the basis for the bargaining that is expected to take place. People on both sides have made it clear that they are ready to talk.</p>
        <p>But the commission's threat to block the merger is not just a negotiating strategy. By forbidding combinations of European businesses, the commission has the power to effectively stop big corporate deals even if the parent companies are not European. On previous occasions, including mergers of two American companies, European regulators have used that power to make companies divest themselves of businesses or change their conduct.</p>
        <p>In an antitrust review related to the Time Warner-AOL deal, European officials are coaxing concessions in the merger proposed between Time Warner and EMI, the big British music distributor.</p>
        <p>EMI executives said today that they would offer proposals to the commission on Tuesday, though they refused to say what compromises they had in mind.</p>
        <p>Amelia Torres, a European spokeswoman on competition issues, would not confirm that officials had proposed a rejection of the AOL deal.</p>
        <p>But she said it was ''normal'' to recommend that a merger be prohibited ''when you are in the second phase of an inquiry and when the companies are not forthcoming in addressing the concerns.''</p>
        <p>Last week, European officials circulated a similar draft rejection of the merger between Time Warner and EMI. Among other things, they are concerned that the EMI deal will reduce the number of major music distributors worldwide to four companies from five now.</p>
        <p>With AOL and Time Warner, officials are worried that the combined companies' store of entertainment programming and access to online customers will give them unparalleled bargaining power with both producers and consumers.</p>
        <p>The AOL merger is related to the EMI deal in European minds because AOL has its own agreement to distribute music from the Bertelsmann Music Group.</p>
        <p>European officials are already hostile to a merger that would unite EMI with Warner Music. They are even less happy about adding Bertelsmann to the mix.</p>
        <p>In a joint statement today, AOL and Time Warner insisted that they remained confident about winning approval for their deal. ''This is a normal part of the process with the E.U.,'' the companies said. ''We are totally comfortable with where we are at this stage of the negotiations. We have made excellent progress and are confident the talks will conclude successfully. As we have said, we are on track to close in the fall.''</p>
        <p>Investors seemed unfazed by the European Commission's threat. The shares of both companies rose on the New York Stock Exchange today, with Time Warner up $1.44 to close at $81.25, and AOL rising 41 cents to $55.56.</p>
        <p>The Federal Trade Commission in Washington is also skeptical about the Time Warner-AOL deal, but its concerns differ from those in Europe. American officials are primarily worried about the ability of America Online's rivals to gain access on Time Warner's cable television networks as cable systems are more heavily used as high-speed links to the Internet from individual homes.</p>
        <p>The two companies have pledged to provide open access, and have argued that is in their interest to carry all popular content providers on their networks.</p>
        <p>But other media companies, led by Walt Disney, contend that the merger would further strengthen what Disney executives call the ''walled garden'' of AOL's proprietary part of the Internet.</p>
        <p>European officials are primarily worried about the overwhelming power the companies could have through the linking of three of the world's five big music distributors -- EMI, Warner and Bertelsmann.</p>
        <p>The European Commission is required to issue a final decision on the EMI merger by Oct. 18 and on the AOL deal by Oct. 24. Under the commission's rules, EMI must submit proposed remedies on antitrust concerns by Tuesday and AOL before next Monday.</p>
        <p>Mario Monti, the European commissioner for competition, has already prevented several big mergers. Earlier this summer, he blocked the combination of WorldCom and Sprint. In March, he stopped the proposed $7 billion merger between Sweden's two big truck manufacturers, Scania and Volvo. And the same month, he blocked the merger of three major aluminum companies.</p>
        <p>Of the deals involving Time Warner, many experts think that the one with EMI faces the tougher resistance, because European officials seem intent on forcing EMI or Warner to sell some important record labels.</p>
        <p>AOL executives have suggested ways of limiting their agreement with Bertelsmann Music, though the proposals so far have not impressed European officials. But if the Europeans block the deal with EMI, AOL executives think that their marketing link with Bertelsmann's music arm will appear less threatening to competition.</p>
