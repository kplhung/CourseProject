        <p>The bumper sticker on the sedan parked in front of Suzanne and Duke Egbert's house declares, ''We Are Everywhere.''</p>
        <p>''We'' refers to contemporary pagans, whose spiritual paths lead them to regard nature as divinely charged. To raise the public profile of pagans -- and try to gain them broader acceptance -- the Egberts and others have established Pagan Pride Day, to be celebrated with events in cities in the United States and Canada timed to coincide roughly with the autumn equinox, on Friday.</p>
        <p>The intent, said Mr. Egbert, 32, is to educate people that pagans live among them, that they are peaceful people (emphatically not devil worshipers), community-minded and as intent on claiming their constitutional right to freedom of assembly as anyone else.</p>
        <p>''It's probably your neighbor,'' added Ms. Egbert, who is also 32 and works in computer software support. ''It's probably the people you go to school with.''</p>
        <p>In pagan circles, the Egberts are known as Cecylyna and Dagonet, high priestess and high priest, respectively, of the Thalia Clan, made up of about three dozen people who gather for ritual drumming, chanting and poetry reading to mark the cycles of the moon and the change of the seasons.</p>
        <p>Since 1998, they have also run the Pagan Pride Project, a nonprofit organization, as well as an Internet site (www.paganpride.org) and are among those planning Pagan Day events at 70 sites in 36 states and in 5 Canadian provinces, starting this weekend and continuing over the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>Ms. Egbert, the project's executive director, says any pagan group that wants to participate must hold a ritual open to the public, be ready to discuss its beliefs with the curious and bring canned goods for a food bank (or a donation to charity), as a symbol of the fall harvest and a show of civic-mindedness.</p>
        <p>The word pagan derives from a Latin term signifying a rural dweller. But for centuries, it has carried a decidedly negative meaning, applied to followers of gods and goddesses of classical or tribal religions displaced by Christianity.</p>
        <p>In recent years, however, paganism has undergone a revival with some people asserting their spiritual identity under its umbrella. The trend is part of a broader movement of individuals seeking community and higher consciousness beyond the bounds of traditional Christianity and Judaism.</p>
        <p>These days, pagan serves as a generic term embracing modern-day witches, goddess worshipers, Druids and men and women who revere the deities of ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome.</p>
        <p>''Pagan is difficult to define, because it is so broad,'' said Cairril Adaire, a graphic artist and national coordinator of the Pagan Education Network, in Bloomington, Ind. While contemporary pagans may share a spiritual reverence for the earth, she says a guiding principle of pagans is the sovereignty of the individual's search for spirituality.</p>
        <p>''Choose for yourself what your spiritual path is,'' she said. ''Develop your own relationship with divinity.''</p>
        <p>Brenda Brasher, an assistant professor of religion at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, said she had encountered pagans on college campuses since her days as a graduate student in California a decade ago. But now, Professor Brasher said, ''they're willing to be much more forceful in articulating their beliefs than even a decade ago and feel they have a place at the table'' of American spirituality.</p>
        <p>Contemporary paganism, Professor Brasher said, has benefited from popular entertainment (television shows like ''Xena: Warrior Princess''), feminism, which has allowed people freedom to speak of the divine in female terms, and an ''attitudinal change'' that inclines many to regard diversity as a value in itself.</p>
        <p>Even in socially conservative Indiana, finding pagans seems a matter of knowing where to look. In a downtown coffeehouse, next to fliers about concerts and political gatherings, is  a notice about the weekly meetings of the Indiana Asatru Council, whose members worship old Norse deities like Odin, Thor and Frigga.</p>
        <p>The council sponsors public rituals: a rally on behalf of the god Thor is scheduled for Thursday. Previous events have proceeded without anti-pagan protesters, Mr. Hankins said.</p>
        <p>A similar quiet has prevailed at Pagan Pride days. Last year, pagan gatherings took place in 32 states and 2 Canadian provinces, ranging from 15 people who beat drums in a California redwood forest to the 350 who showed up for rituals in Broad Ripple Park in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>What such turnouts say about the national pagan population is anyone's guess.</p>
        <p>''There is a huge debate raging about numbers,'' Ms. Adaire said. Her Pagan Educational Network estimates there are 600,000 American pagans.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot more than mainstream America would expect,'' she said, ''and probably a lot fewer than some of our more optimistic pagan comrades would hope.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 21, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about efforts by pagans to increase public understanding omitted the full name of a member of a pagan organization in Indiana who said there had been no protests over his group's rituals. He is C. L. Hankins II.</p>
