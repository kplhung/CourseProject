        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Frustration Grows With Cost of Health Insurance'' (front page, Sept. 18):</p>
        <p>Health insurance costs are rising because improvements in health care come with a hefty price tag. That expense is shared by all subscribers. But not everyone has the same insurance needs.</p>
        <p>A healthy young person needs coverage against the risk of severe illness or injury, and could pay other expenses more cheaply out of pocket. In addition to catastrophic coverage,  a middle-aged diabetic with heart disease needs coverage to help defray the costs of chronic medical care and prescription drugs. Clearly, the premiums for these types of insurance would differ.</p>
        <p>As the managed care experiment has shown, short of rationing health care there is little to be done to cut costs. But it is possible to make the way that costs are shared more equitable.</p>
        <p>JAY S. MARKOWITZ, M.D.  Owings Mills, Md., Sept. 18, 2000</p>
