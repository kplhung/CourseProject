        <p>Rosie Pitches In: 3 Calls on Strike</p>
        <p>So the actress CELESTE HOLM told the talk show host ROSIE O'DONNELL that she should show her support for striking actors by asking sponsors not to run commercials made with nonunion talent.</p>
        <p>Faster than you can say ''We'll be right back after this message,'' Ms. O'Donnell did just that, calling Procter &amp; Gamble, Kellogg's and General Motors, her spokeswoman said.</p>

        <p>Rosie Pitches In: 3 Calls on Strike</p>
        <p>So the actress CELESTE HOLM told the talk show host ROSIE O'DONNELL that she should show her support for striking actors by asking sponsors not to run commercials made with nonunion talent.</p>
        <p>Faster than you can say ''We'll be right back after this message,'' Ms. O'Donnell did just that, calling Procter &amp; Gamble, Kellogg's and General Motors, her spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Donnell's involvement was the latest twist in a 20-week strike by 135,000 members of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. The initial stumbling block was how to pay actors for appearing in commercials. Negotiators for the advertising industry said that they wanted to do away with longstanding rules governing residuals.</p>
        <p>''I have given my total support to the actors,'' Ms. O'Donnell said through her spokeswoman. ''I have talked to Procter &amp; Gamble, Kellogg's and General Motors and asked them to go back to the negotiating table.'' The spokeswoman, LOIS SMITH, added: ''If the union asked her to go on strike, she would. She's very aware of the percentage of people in the union who depend on commercials for their living.''</p>
        <p>Some commercials are being produced in defiance of the walkout, but the union has permitted its members to appear in others under an interim agreement with sponsors and advertising agencies. Under that arrangement,  commercials made during the strike will be subject to whatever terms are agreed to when the strike is settled.  Negotiations continued yesterday, union officials said.</p>
        <p>Politicians On the Prowl</p>
        <p>Just before PATRICIA S. BURNHAM'S party to show off a sometime decorator showhouse that is now for sale (asking price: $14 million), someone predicted that there would be a ''roomful of billionaires'' in the neo-Federal house at 603 Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>A roomful of politicians was more like it.</p>
        <p>The public advocate, MARK GREEN, a City Council member, EVA S. MOSKOWITZ, and ANDREW S. ERISTOFF, the city's finance commissioner, were there. And Ms. Burnham, a real estate broker who has the exclusive right to sell the 80-year-old house at the northeast corner of 64th Street, was standing with WILLIAM F. WELD, the former governor of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>''You know he's going to run for governor in 2006,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Really?'' a guest said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weld smiled. ''I have some experience, and I'm a native New Yorker,'' he said, not really answering the question, in that way that politicians have.</p>
        <p>Why not 2002? ''There's a five-year residency requirement,'' he said, ''and I only moved back in January.''</p>
        <p>There was no residency requirement for the party, and fortunately for Mr. Weld, name recognition was not a problem with the three men checking the guest lists at the door. JEFFREY T. LEEDS, an investment banker, kidded Mr. Weld, telling another guest, ''He wasn't on the list, but the guards let him in anyway.''</p>
        <p>That was not the last of Mr. Weld's headaches. Later in the evening he was half-sitting on an 18th-century Maggiolini commode that had been borrowed from GUY REGAL, a dealer. Mr. Regal saw Mr. Weld perched on the commode (obscuring the 20th-century Picasso lithograph that Mr. Regal had also lent) and said, ''Please, sir, don't sit on that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weld murmured an apology and moved on.</p>
        <p>The other guests were exploring the house, which has 25 rooms, an elevator, a marble staircase, a master bedroom with two dressing rooms, and a pantry that could be mistaken for a library. The leather spines of books -- Carlyle and Shakespeare, among others -- had been glued onto the fronts of the cabinets there.</p>
        <p>''Oh, look,'' exclaimed another guest, LYNN HANKE, who remembered visiting the house as a child. ''The Wheaties can go right behind 'The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.' ''</p>
