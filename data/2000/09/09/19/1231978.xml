        <p>The YankeeNets, the sports-based company that owns the Yankees, Nets and Devils, donated $500,000 to the United States Naval Academy last week to establish the Dr. John J. McMullen Endowment for the Brigade of Midshipmen.</p>
        <p>McMullen, who sold the Devils to YankeeNets for $175 million at the end of last season, is a 1940 graduate of Navy. Several years ago, he donated $1 million to establish the Distinguished Chair of Leadership at the academy.</p>
        <p>McMullen said yesterday that the gift from YankeeNets would support academics, athletics, leadership, character development and admissions at Navy.</p>
        <p>When I was there, it was so rigorous and difficult that my class had 650 and ended up with 425, he said. A lot of that was not only academics but discipline. Everybody has a certain degree of leadership. It's important to bring it out and make sure it's practiced.</p>
