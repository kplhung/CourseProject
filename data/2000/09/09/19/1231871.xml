        <p>The New York Liberty, a team deemed too old to seriously contend for the Women's National Basketball Association title this past season, continues to get younger by the day.</p>
        <p>The Liberty acquired guard Grace Daley, 24, from the Minnesota Lynx yesterday in exchange for New York's first-round draft pick in the 2001 draft. Daley, 5 feet 6 inches, was the Lynx's top draft choice and the fifth over all this year, but she spent most of the season playing behind Betty Lennox, who was named the league's rookie of the year.</p>
        <p>''We have always had great interest in Grace, given her athleticism, overall talent and brilliant collegiate career,'' said Carol Blazejowski, the Liberty's senior vice president and general manager. ''We've added an extremely talented, young guard to our team that will give us tremendous depth and flexibility in the backcourt.''</p>
        <p>Daley, who finished her collegiate career as Tulane University's career leading scorer, male or female, with 2,249 points, appeared in 30 games with Minnesota last season, averaging 5.8 points, 2.4 rebounds and 1.9 assists a game.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding age, the Liberty made its third trip to the W.N.B.A. championship series last month after winning its second Eastern Conference title. The Houston Comets won the series, 2-0.</p>
