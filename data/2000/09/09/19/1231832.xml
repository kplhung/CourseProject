        <p>The fight between the media mogul Vladimir V. Gusinsky, his creditors and the government took an unexpected turn today.</p>
        <p>Gazprom, the giant gas company, said Mr. Gusinsky, indebted and under government pressure, had backed out of a secret agreement that he signed two months ago to sell his entire newspaper and broadcasting business. Mr. Gusinsky, acknowledging that he signed the deal, said it was void because it had been made under duress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky has been critical of the Kremlin, and his brief arrest this year has raised questions about the direction of press freedoms. His company, Media-Most, is heavily indebted to Gazprom and has been under pressure to settle those debts.</p>
        <p>As the the single-largest shareholder in Gazprom, the government wields tremendous influence in Gazprom affairs and is viewed as playing an indirect role in the intensifying feud between Gazprom and Media-Most.</p>
        <p>The government raided Media-Most offices in May, and Mr. Gusinsky was later temporarily jailed on charges of embezzlement. The charges were dropped in July, but not before Mr. Gusinsky had agreed to sell his entire business, for $300 million, including the assumption of its debts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky backed out of the deal last week and proposed new terms that would let him retain a controlling stake, said Alfred Kokh, manager of media assets for Gazprom and a rival to Mr. Gusinsky.  Mr. Kokh resigned a previous post as state asset sales chief in 1997, after Mr. Gusinsky had accused him of giving confidential information to a business rival during the sale of the state-owned telephone company.</p>
        <p>''He's been playing games with us for over a month, saying he'd do the deal,'' Mr. Kokh said by telephone from London. ''Now they say they won't do it and are giving us a new proposition that's not good for us. We'll sue. We won't agree to take losses because Mr. Gusinsky conducted his business badly.''</p>
        <p>Gazprom said it would ask the Russian prosecutor general to investigate. It was that prosecutor who jailed Mr. Gusinsky in June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gusinsky, who was in New York and Washington last week to lobby for political and financial support, said today that he had been pressured to sign the accord virtually at gunpoint and that it was not legally binding. For months, Media-Most has been scrambling to find an investor to buy the Gazprom debt, which originated in 1998, two years after Mr. Gusinsky supported President Boris N. Yeltsin's re-election quest.</p>
        <p>Media-Most and Gazprom have been haggling for months over how much the media company is worth and how much of it Gazprom owns. Mr. Kokh said Mr. Gusinsky opted to sell out in July, when he realized that Gazprom's valuation would leave him with a minority stake in the company.</p>
        <p>One of the country's richest men, Mr. Gusinsky made his fortune after the collapse of the Soviet Union. His critics accuse him of abusing his connections to win low-cost government loans. Once a Kremlin ally, his position shifted last year, when he supported the opponents of Vladimir V. Putin, who was prime minister, in parliamentary elections.</p>
        <p>Gazprom guaranteed two loans to Media-Most in 1998 that totaled at least $380 million. Those loans are secured by a 40 percent stake in Media-Most, Gazprom says. Gazprom paid off one loan. The second falls due next summer. In all, Media-Most and its subsidiaries owe $605 million to various lenders, including the City of Moscow and a state-owned bank, according to Gazprom.</p>
        <p>Early last month, Gazprom borrowed $300 million from the main savings bank, Sberbank, to pay for Media-Most and transferred the cash to an account at Deutsche Bank in London. The company plans to hire the bank to help find a foreign buyer for the media assets.</p>
