        <p>Repetitive motions, like working on a computer keyboard or cutting meat, have long been known to contribute to repetitive stress injuries. But now, a new study finds, psychological factors may also play a role.</p>
        <p>Researchers writing in The British Medical Journal said they found a link between forearm pain and job dissatisfaction. Other forms of psychological stress were also linked to the pain, said the researchers, from the University of Manchester in England.</p>
        <p>Forearm pain rarely occurs in isolation, the study says, noting that ''high levels of distress and adverse psychosocial factors also produced the onset of symptoms.''</p>
        <p>The researchers based their conclusions on a survey of more than 1,200 people, ages 18 to 65. Two years later, after follow-up questionnaires were sent, 105 people who had reported being free of pain in their forearms said they were experiencing difficulties.</p>
        <p>After taking work histories, the researchers found that the strongest factor in the onset of pain seemed to be not just repetitive motions at work, but work dissatisfaction. People who said they were unsatisfied with the support they got from colleagues or supervisors were at higher risk, as were people who felt they were rarely allowed to make their own decisions at work. General anxiety about one's health also appeared to be a factor.</p>
