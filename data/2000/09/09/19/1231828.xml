        <p>Even as his opponent shifts into a more aggressive gear, Vice President Al Gore is hewing to a front-runner's  strategy that relies on discipline,  stagecraft and control.</p>
        <p>With two weeks left before the first of three presidential debates, Mr. Gore is determined not to be forced onto the defense by the sharpened attacks of Gov. George W. Bush. On Saturday, Mr. Bush delivered a speech that assailed Mr. Gore as a big-government Democrat, a point the Republican nominee then reinforced in a series of interviews on Sunday.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore has declined to respond in his own words, though his campaign aides have had plenty to say. Today, in two appearances in Las Vegas before flying here for a fund-raiser, Mr. Gore stuck carefully to script. At a rally where he did not mention Mr. Bush by name, he promoted his plans for improving women's health care, and then he formally accepted the endorsement of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters at the union's convention.</p>
        <p>Such campaigning has become Mr. Gore's pattern since his poll numbers began improving after the Democratic National Convention. In many ways, he has become the boy in the bubble, running a highly insulated, carefully managed campaign that keeps him on message, places him in photogenic surroundings and circumvents traditional media whenever possible.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Gore surpassed his previous record for the interval since his last open news conference, a mark that now stands at 63 days. Instead, Mr. Gore is relying increasingly on lighthearted appearances on television talk shows -- he sat beside  Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman last week -- to convey a sense of his candidacy, and his typical day on the road is often driven by setting as much as by substance. While he grants occasional interviews, they are often limited to subjects of his choosing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's strategy of essentially trying to freeze news coverage is not a new one, either for him or for American politics. ''This is line one from the Reagan playbook,'' said S. Robert Lichter, president of The Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan group that monitors coverage of campaigns. ''There's no need to generate good press when you're in the lead. You just step aside and let your opponent's bad press keep accumulating.''</p>
        <p>For their part, Bush advisers are hoping to generate some news that favors their candidate, by increasing his schedule and focusing anew on his position on issues of concern to the middle class. ''We're going for a thaw,'' said Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman. As he is doing now, Mr. Gore went into a kind of visible isolation last February after he began to overcome his primary opponent, Bill Bradley. He delivered packaged messages on a variety of issues, raised money, shored up relations with traditional Democrats, especially minority voters, and devoted himself to activities like spending eight hours in a single school. He avoided holding a news conference from Feb. 19 to April 21.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore defeated Mr. Bradley in every state where there was a contest, and his aides believe he is now achieving similarly positive results. He has moved ahead of Mr. Bush in some polls, his fund-raising is vigorous, and he is garnering strong coverage in the local media, they say.</p>
        <p>By avoiding news conferences, Mr. Gore has kept the focus of coverage on his chosen message, minimized any chance for distraction and lessened the prospect that some careless remark might prompt a media feeding frenzy. He is careful, for instance, not to come back to the press cabin of Air Force II on days when his comments could prolong the shelf life of a harmful story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did just that, with devastating results, when he told reporters on his plane several weeks ago that he had not done a good job explaining his tax-cut plan. That confession helped fuel a weeklong series of news reports suggesting that the Bush campaign was having problems communicating its message.</p>
        <p>Republicans are now trying to make an issue out of Mr. Gore's seclusion. They set up a conference call today for reporters to speak with Representative David Dreier, a Republican from California, to focus attention on what they called ''Gore's disappearance from the American public.''</p>
        <p>And Nelson Warfield, a Republican strategist in Bob Dole's 1996 campaign, said in an interview today that  ''it's harder to get at Al Gore than it is to get at the mummy's crypt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's seclusion stands in stark contrast to the more accessible campaign style of Mr. Bush, who holds regular news conferences.</p>
        <p>But political analysts and Gore advisers said that Mr. Gore was only being savvy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lichter said the public does not care much about the media's access to a candidate and that there was little reason for Mr. Gore to change tactics as long as he is winning the daily battle for headlines.</p>
        <p>A study by Mr. Lichter's center found that during the first week of September, when an open microphone captured Mr. Bush denigrating a reporter, Mr. Gore received favorable coverage on the networks' evening newscasts at the same time that Mr. Bush received negative coverage, the first week that has happened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's team of strategists, many of them tested in two Clinton-Gore campaigns and the crucible of impeachment, have decided that the path to victory is surer when little is left to chance. That is particularly true, they assert, during this stage of the campaign, when the views of swing voters are likely to remain frozen until the October debates.</p>
        <p>Instead, they have chosen to use this time to continue their efforts to humanize Mr. Gore, a process that accelerated at the Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>Thus, the appearances on talk shows, where Mr. Gore scores by slapping a high-five with Ms. Winfrey or reading a self-deprecating top ten list to Mr. Letterman. He is scheduled to appear with Jay Leno on Tuesday, and an appearance on Rosie O'Donnell's show is also being discussed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides like such forums because the hosts rarely ask the difficult questions. One Gore aide exulted last week that the appearance on Oprah had been an ''hour-long commercial.''</p>
        <p>Some of the Gore campaign's bubble effect is simply a consequence of the trappings of the vice presidency. Mr. Gore travels on Air Force II, which has room for only a small, rotating pool of reporters. A separate plane carries most of the press corps.</p>
        <p>As he campaigns, the vice president is cordoned off by Secret Service agents and aides.</p>
        <p>Even encounters intended to look spontaneous are anything but. In late August, on his way to deliver a speech in Tallahassee on his drug plan, Mr. Gore and his wife, Tipper, stopped at Baker's Pharmacy with a crew of cameras in tow. There, the Gores found 82-year-old Myrtle Jennings, who was only too happy to tell them that her $207 monthly drug bill sometimes forced her to choose among prescriptions.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Jennings was not there by accident. A Gore aide, directed to her by the pharmacist, had called her four days earlier, interviewed her, and then invited her to show up at the store at the appointed time.</p>
