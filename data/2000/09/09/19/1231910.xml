        <p>Juniper Networks, a leader in Internet switching technology, intends to announce a new line of products today, mainly routing switches that are smaller, less costly and more efficient than its previous models. In doing so, Juniper will expand its rivalry with Cisco Systems. Juniper has made its name by developing routers for the core of Internet networks that can handle flows of up to 10 billion digital bits a second. Cisco's fastest commercially available routers can handle flows of only 2.5 billion bits a second. Still, Cisco has remained the dominant provider of Internet switches that connect to paying customers rather than only to other big switches at a network's heart. Juniper's two new Internet switches are aimed squarely at that market.</p>
