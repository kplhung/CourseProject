        <p>More than 800 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division, one of the Army's elite fighting units, were sent to Kosovo last year with little training in the subtler arts of policing the streets and preventing violence between ethnic factions, according to an Army investigation into accusations that members of the unit beat and manhandled ethnic Albanians.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>More than 800 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division, one of the Army's elite fighting units, were sent to Kosovo last year with little training in the subtler arts of policing the streets and preventing violence between ethnic factions, according to an Army investigation into accusations that members of the unit beat and manhandled ethnic Albanians.</p>
        <p>A report released by the Army today on the investigation, which began after a member of the unit was accused of murdering a Kosovo Albanian girl in January, cast a far wider blame for the misconduct than officials had previously disclosed. It  suggested that decisions by Army leaders in Kosovo and in the United States had contributed at least in part to violations of ''basic standards of conduct, human decency and the Army values of treating others with dignity and respect.''</p>
        <p>The report accused the soldiers' commanders in Kosovo of displaying a ''propensity toward Serb favoritism'' and an overly hostile attitude toward Kosovo's Albanians. It concluded that they either knew or should have known about complaints that soldiers were using excessive force and mistreating women by groping their breasts and buttocks during searches.</p>
        <p>While the report said the misconduct had been relatively isolated, the most striking finding involved the 82nd's lack of training for an operation that stopped short of what the Army calls ''high-intensity conflict.'' The report said the troops received little peacekeeping training before they were deployed and had not conducted a peacekeeping mission rehearsal exercise.</p>
        <p>As a result, the lead investigator, Col. John W. Morgan 3rd, concluded, the soldiers ''experienced difficulties tempering their combat mentality'' and adapting to the sort of low-level violence and intimidation found between Kosovo's Serbs and Albanians.</p>
        <p>In the report, which was released after the newspaper European Stars and Stripes requested it under the Freedom of Information Act, the Army also disclosed that on Sept. 8 the chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, had ordered a new review of training, leadership and readiness of the division to address the investigation's findings. He ordered the commander of the Army's Forces Command, Gen. John W. Hendrix, ''to take corrective actions as appropriate'' within 30 days.</p>
        <p>It was not clear why the 82nd's soldiers did not receive more training before being sent to Kosovo for six months beginning in September 1999. Army officials in Washington and at the 82nd's headquarters at Fort Bragg, N.C., declined to discuss the unit's training, though one official said the division's soldiers underwent all the training required by the Army at the time.</p>
        <p>Army officials said today that all of the 6,000 American soldiers now in Kosovo received specialized training for the operation, but they could not say whether it was more extensive than the 82nd's had been.</p>
        <p>The issue of having some of the nation's most highly trained combat units keeping peace abroad has been a delicate one at the Pentagon and in Congress, and has been raised in the presidential campaign. Many people in uniform argue that elite combat divisions like the 82nd, whose mission is to seek out and destroy enemy forces, are ill-equipped to handle the tasks required by peacekeeping.</p>
        <p>While some military experts argue that the United States should create special peacekeeping units, the military counters that all of its forces have to be prepared for the ultimate war-fighting mission, since operations like those in Kosovo, initially at least, involve the dangerous task of separating warring factions and can spiral back into all-out combat.</p>
        <p>In the 82nd's case, however, it appears that soldiers received little preparation at all for what they would face in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, who is traveling in Asia, released a statement today expressing support for General Shinseki's steps but warning that the Army had to ensure that the misconduct did not happen again.</p>
        <p>''The incidents described in that report are a source of grave concern and reflect behavior that cannot be allowed to recur,'' Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>The investigation detailed today grew out of the rape and murder in January of an 11-year-old Albanian girl, Merita Shabiu. Last month, Staff Sgt. Frank J. Ronghi, a member of the Third Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne, pleaded guilty to the crime and was sentenced to life in prison by a military court.</p>
        <p>The investigation into Sergeant Ronghi confirmed accusations that others in his unit, Company A, had mistreated civilians in the town of Vitina in the days and weeks before the girl's death. The report detailed several incidents in which soldiers beat or threatened Albanian men and indecently assaulted women.</p>
        <p>Last summer, information from the investigative report, which at the time was still classified, was cited often during Sergeant Ronghi's court-martial. Defense lawyers sought leniency by arguing that a ''negative command climate'' -- the exact words used in the report -- had created an highly unstable situation in Vitina.</p>
        <p>Last March, the 82nd Airborne disciplined five enlisted soldiers and four officers for their involvement in the misconduct. Colonel Morgan, the officer who conducted the investigation, had recommended that some of those military personnel face criminal charges at a court-martial, but the punishments meted out involved less severe administrative actions.</p>
        <p>The Army has declined to identify those punished, but officials said today that they included the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Michael D. Ellerbe, and the company commander, Capt. Kevin J. Lambert, whose actions were singled out for criticism in the report released today.</p>
        <p>The report, said Colonel Ellerbe had directed his soldiers to carry out one specific order -- identifying and neutralizing Albanian factions -- that went beyond his superiors' intentions, fostering a climate that led to misconduct.</p>
        <p>''The unit's overly aggressive tendencies were manifested in practices such as the unit slogan -- 'shoot 'em in the face' -- and their standard operating procedure of pointing the M-4 carbine weapon system with attached maglight in the face of local nationals in order to illuminate their faces,'' the report said.</p>
