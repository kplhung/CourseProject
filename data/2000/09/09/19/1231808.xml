        <p>William Brian Little, an investment banker who was a founding partner of Forstmann Little, the New York leveraged-buyout firm, died on Sunday in Manhattan. He was 58 and maintained residences in Manhattan; Amagansett, N.Y.; and Santa Barbara, Calif.</p>
        <p>The cause was cardiac arrest, said his wife, Judith.</p>
        <p>A graduate of Colgate University and the Harvard Business School, Mr. Little began his career on Wall Street with White Weld &amp; Company, primarily in the firm's Los Angeles office. When White Weld was bought by Merrill Lynch in the late 1970's, Mr. Little returned to New York.</p>
        <p>Rather than continue his career at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Little joined with Theodore J. Forstmann and his brother Nicholas C. Forstmann to form Forstmann Little in 1978.</p>
        <p>In contrast to many of the leveraged-buyout firms that flourished in the 1980's, Forstmann Little relied less on borrowed money and more on equity financing to pay for the companies it bought.</p>
        <p>The strategy paid handsome dividends.</p>
        <p>Between 1980 and 1992, the firm and its limited partners invested about $1 billion in 18 different deals. That investment reaped a return of about $5 billion. The successes included the Dr Pepper Company and the Topps Company, the trading card maker.</p>
        <p>During his career at the firm, which lasted until 1994, when he retired, Mr. Little played a crucial but low-key role.</p>
        <p>''He was no wimp, but he didn't have a big ego,'' Nicholas Forstmann said yesterday. ''He was pretty plain-spoken and did what he said he was going to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Little was a private investor after he left the firm he helped to found.</p>
        <p>The success he enjoyed during his years at Forstmann Little gave him the opportunity to pursue other interests.</p>
        <p>Colgate University, his undergraduate alma mater, was high on his list of outside interests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Little was named a trustee of the university in 1987 and chairman of its board in 1996.</p>
        <p>''He had a particular appreciation of the value of a liberal arts education,'' Charles Karelis, the president of Colgate, said yesterday. ''He was a cultured person, and he led a balanced life. You would not know from talking to Brian Little how successful he was in business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Little served on several corporate boards, including the Topps Company, ScreamingMedia and the Douglas Emmett Realty Funds.</p>
        <p>He was also a trustee of the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival and was a member of the Museum of Modern Art's committee on photography.</p>
        <p>In addition to his wife, Mr. Little is survived by a daughter, Jacqueline P. Little, of San Francisco; a son, Gregory S. Little, also of San Francisco; and three grandchildren.</p>
