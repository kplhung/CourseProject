        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Clinton's initiative to increase staffing ratios and improve care for nursing home residents is a welcome one (news article, Sept. 17). Unfortunately, it comes at a time of increasing labor shortages.</p>
        <p>In addition, a recent ruling by the federal Health Care Financing Administration mandates that only certified nurse's assistants can feed residents in nursing homes. Historically, specially trained volunteers have successfully assisted in feeding residents, allowing certified assistants to spend time assisting residents with functions requiring more skilled training.</p>

        <p>President Clinton's initiative to increase staffing ratios and improve care for nursing home residents is a welcome one (news article, Sept. 17). Unfortunately, it comes at a time of increasing labor shortages.</p>
        <p>In addition, a recent ruling by the federal Health Care Financing Administration mandates that only certified nurse's assistants can feed residents in nursing homes. Historically, specially trained volunteers have successfully assisted in feeding residents, allowing certified assistants to spend time assisting residents with functions requiring more skilled training.</p>
        <p>This recent ruling prohibits an enriching volunteer experience and makes President Clinton's goal of improved staffing ratios even harder to achieve.</p>
