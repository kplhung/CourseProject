        <p>Elephant Birth Control</p>

        <p>Elephant Birth Control</p>
        <p>African elephants are an endangered species, with a population of perhaps 300,000 to 600,000 that is about half of what it was two decades ago. But efforts to conserve the animals have actually led, in some areas, to overpopulation, resulting in damage from overgrazing (adult elephants eat up to 300 pounds of grasses, roots and parts of trees each day).</p>
        <p>One way to control this overpopulation, though not a very pleasant one, is by culling entire family groups. Birth control is more humane, though the current method -- using hormonal implants -- can cause the females to act oddly, isolating themselves within the families.</p>
        <p>Now, a veterinary scientist from the University of Georgia, with colleagues in South Africa and Montana, has developed a different method of contraception, without the behavioral side effects. It uses an immunocontraceptive vaccine -- that is, one that causes the animal to produce antibodies that prevent fertilization.</p>
        <p>The vaccine is produced from the eggs of pigs, using the eggs' protein coating, or zona pellucida, which is very similar to that found on elephant eggs. The proteins act as antigens, which, when introduced into the elephant, produce antibodies that persist for about a year.</p>
        <p>The scientists, reporting in Nature, tested the vaccine in Kruger National Park in South Africa, inoculating 21 females, giving 20 others a placebo and fitting them all with radio collars for tracking (so that the vaccinated animals could get booster shots).</p>
        <p>A year later, about half as many vaccinated as unvaccinated elephants were pregnant. The researchers also found that giving the booster shots sooner resulted in even fewer pregnancies, and that the method was reversible -- elephants no longer receiving the vaccine eventually became pregnant again.</p>
        <p>Examining Quake's Reach</p>
        <p>In most earthquakes, destruction is worst at the epicenter and lessens with distance. The 1994 Northridge quake in Southern California, however, was an exception: damage in Santa Monica, some 12 miles from the quake's center in Northridge, was far worse than it should have been had the usual rule held.</p>
        <p>Seismologists with the University of California at Los Angeles and Kansas State University now think they know why Santa Monica shook so badly on that day in 1994. The seismic waves emanating from below Northridge, they report in the journal Science, were focused by geologic lenses far beneath the ground, just as a glass lens concentrates light.</p>
        <p>Examining seismic records from aftershocks of the 6.7-magnitude quake and a geological profile of the earth under Santa Monica, the researchers propose that a convex geological structure about two miles deep, where a fault in the bedrock meets the sediments of the Los Angeles basin, acted as a lens, bending the waves toward the surface. More precisely, the structure acted as three lenses, since the researchers found evidence of three loci, where the refracted waves converged.</p>
        <p>The researchers noted that Santa Monica's misfortune was primarily the result of the orientation of the waves from Northridge. Waves coming from other directions, they said, would not be as well focused. This was the case in the San Fernando earthquake in 1971, when Santa Monica was largely unscathed.</p>
        <p>The Shy Mimosa</p>
        <p>As plants go, the mimosa is a bit of a shrinking violet. When touched, the mimosa's frondlike leaves fold up and the stems droop.</p>
        <p>Researchers in Japan, writing in Nature, have discovered some secrets behind the plant's sensitivity. The researchers found that bending is related to how extensively the amino acid tyrosine in the stem proteins are phosphoryl ated (meaning the tyrosine has phosphate groups added). Tyrosine phosphorylation controls many processes in animal proteins but until now had not been known to have a big role in plant proteins -- except in slime molds.</p>
