        <p>About 2 a.m. today, just hours after more than 200,000 people claiming victory for the opposition candidate in last Sunday's presidential election had gone home, the government of President Slobodan Milosevic pressed through a final ruling that both candidates would have to meet in a second round on Oct. 8.</p>
        <p>This decision of the government-controlled federal election commission, which had not been expected until tonight, was a shock to the political system and showed that Mr. Milosevic had decided not to leave office without a fight.</p>
        <p>It is likely to provoke anger here once people wake. There could be a new and explosive round of street demonstrations from supporters of the opposition candidate, Vojislav  Kostunica, who believe he won the election with more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica has vowed to boycott a second round and held out hope that the commission would recognize his outright victory. In an interview on Wednesday, he said of President Milosevic: ''I think there is now no way out for him. This is a situation that cannot last long.''</p>
        <p>''People know I won these elections,'' Mr. Kostunica said in the interview. ''Why should I accept Milosevic's offer of a second round? People won't understand it and will feel that I'm betraying them.''</p>
        <p>Wednesday night, to the massed and happy crowd, shouting and swaying under a clear night filled with stars, Mr. Kostunica said: ''We tell them from this place that there is no second round. There is no market in votes.''</p>
        <p>In the announcement in the middle of the night, the electoral board said, ''Based on the final results from 10,673 polling sites, presidential candidate Vojislav Kostunica won 2,474,392 votes, or 48.96 percent, and Slobodan Milosevic 1,951,761 votes, or 38.62 percent,'' and therefore, it said, the second round of voting would go ahead.</p>
        <p>Earlier, the opposition announced that by its count of 98.7 percent of the ballots, Mr. Kostunica had won 52.54 percent of the vote, compared with Mr. Milosevic's 35.01 percent.</p>
        <p>According to opposition members of the federal election commission, the commission reduced the number of eligible voters in the country by 600,000 people, and made no effort to reconcile its results with those of the opposition, as it is supposed to do under the law. An opposition member, Sinisa Nikolic, said the commission meeting scheduled for 8 p.m. Wednesday night had been postponed after the chairman left the room, saying his wife was sick. He returned after the rally had ended, bearing a document from the federal statistics institute, Mr. Nikolic said. He said there was then a vote on the final results; the opposition members were outvoted by government supporters.</p>
        <p>''This is not a decision but a joke,'' Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia said of the announcement by the state news agency, Tanjug. He told Radio Indeks, ''We will call for a total blockade of the system and institutions.'' Mr. Kostunica may have a different view later today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic has been silent since the vote on Sunday, making no appearances of any kind.</p>
        <p>The size of the crowd was a message to Mr. Milosevic, too, backed by other large rallies in towns like Novi Sad, where 35,000 gathered, and Nis, with 25,000. In addition, 15,000 rallied in Kragujevac and 10,000 in Kraljevo.</p>
        <p>Before the commission announcement, Western governments were passing the word to Mr. Milosevic that his options were fast running out, senior Western officials said in telephone interviews.</p>
        <p>They told Mr. Milosevic through his intermediaries that he had a few days to renounce power and leave the country without difficulty, to settle where he would, but that if he delayed, he could face arrest and a trial in The Hague on war crimes charges.</p>
        <p>''His choice is to fight or make a graceful exit,'' a senior Western official said. ''His only hope of avoiding The Hague is to say, publicly and irrevocably, that he's leaving.'' If he leaves, Russia and Belarus appear to be possible destinations.</p>
        <p>No Western country would publicly bless an arrangement like this, the officials stressed, given Mr. Milosevic's indictment by the tribunal, a creation of the United Nations Security Council. ''But there are enough people indicating, to the extent he's listening, that he has a little time to make a dignified exit without interference,'' another senior Western official said. ''We want him to hear it loud and clear.''</p>
        <p>The representatives of some Western nations left Belgrade before the NATO bombing began last spring, and from a distance have been lobbying the Serbs to overturn Mr. Milosevic, with offers to end economic sanctions and provide aid.</p>
        <p>In his interview, Mr. Kostunica said Mr. Milosevic could cling to power now only through repression. ''Politically he has no future, and I'm not sure he can count on repression, either,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica told the crowd that he was sure of his victory, and he had a message for the army and the police, who did not interfere Wednesday night. ''Our message to the army and the police is that we are one,'' he said. ''The army and the police are part of the people; they exist to protect the people, not one man and his family.''</p>
        <p>As the crowd shouted, ''He's finished!'' about Mr. Milosevic, Mr. Kostunica asked, ''Why would our army, which was so courageous last year against NATO, be afraid now of one man?''</p>
        <p>People in the crowd were happy but slightly unsure that Mr. Milosevic was beaten. There was a sense of self-discovery and suspense, caught in a historical tide that had not yet reached its peak.</p>
        <p>''I believe he's finished, because of the people here,'' said Ivana Petrov, a 25-year-old medical student. ''We hope he'll go. But he won't go so easily. Things here can't change that fast, even if he does go.''</p>
        <p>Vladimir Panic, a 22-year-old economics student, said: ''I think that finally we'll win.'' How quickly? ''It's going to be tough,'' he said. ''People will have to go out onto the streets for many days.''</p>
        <p>Aleksandar, a middle-aged man who would not give his surname, said the atmosphere was fantastic. ''But you never know what the authorities here can do,'' he said. ''We've had big rallies in Belgrade before.'' But then he brightened. ''Now, though,'' he said, ''all of Serbia is like this.''</p>
        <p>His wife broke in, saying, ''I think he's finished, and we are very, very happy.''</p>
        <p>Wednesday night, state television ran a straight report of a news conference by Mr. Djindjic, the opposition leader, although it came after the airing of an interview with Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic, who blamed the international media and NATO for deluding voters.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Milosevic, calling the elections proved to be a blunder; his term extended to next July, but he called the election early, apparently hoping to cement and extent his hold.</p>
        <p>Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, the army chief of staff, who supports Mr. Milosevic, gave an interview in which he said the army would stay out of politics. He said that Mr. Milosevic ''will never order the army to intervene against the people'' and that the army would ''respect the choice'' of Yugoslavs in presidential election.</p>
        <p>Late Wednesday, as a famous Yugoslav musician, Goran Bregovic, a Sarajevan, played to what remained of this huge rally -- his first performance in Belgrade in many years -- the streets were full of discarded leaflets and banners.</p>
        <p>One showed Mr. Kostunica against the Yugoslav flag of blue, white and red with the title: president of Yugoslavia. Gorica Trajkovic, 21, looked at the leaflet and shrugged. ''I know it's true,'' she said. ''But it isn't true yet.''</p>
