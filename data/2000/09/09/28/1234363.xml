        <p>The State Police were going through the cash boxes of scores of betting clerks at Belmont Park racecourse yesterday as part of an investigation into allegations that clerks at New York tracks laundered money for a criminal organization, law enforcement and racing officials said.</p>
        <p>''They are auditing the house,'' said Clem Imperato, a consultant to the New York Racing Association, which owns the tracks under a state franchise. ''That's really what they are doing.''</p>
        <p>The association's president, Terry Meyocks, issued a statement after the state raids started, saying his organization was ''assisting federal authorities and providing them with certain documents they need.'' The association ''is not the target of any investigation, federal or state,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The investigation that led to the raids, first reported in The New York Post, began about six months ago, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>The State Attorney General's Organized Crime Task Force and the state police have been examining allegations that people with links to organized crime have been colluding with parimutuel clerks to launder money.</p>
        <p>The clerks are believed to be, for a fee, exchanging large, easily traceable bills for dozens of smaller, untraceable bills, according to these officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>It was not known yesterday where the large bills came from or what sort of criminal organization might be involved. Cash from drug sales tends to be in small denominations, while gambling money and stolen cash is often in larger bills.</p>
        <p>''We fully anticipate to at some point soon come forward with indictments and arrests, but we can't say when that will be,'' said Darren Dopp, a spokesman for the attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer.</p>
        <p>Racing officials were also served with federal subpoenas yesterday as part of an Internal Revenue Service investigation into activities at the tracks, law enforcement officials said. It was not clear whether the two investigations are related.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday morning, dozens of state police officers raided the betting departments at Belmont, Aqueduct and Saratoga, seizing stacks of records, boxes of cashed winning tickets and cash boxes. At Belmont, the police had to wait overnight for a time-locked safe to open before they could examine the cash boxes.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, race track officials said, the state investigators were poring over the contents of the boxes, which contain not only large amounts of cash but also records of bets placed, winnings paid out and money taken in.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said a number of mid-level and low-level racing association employees were believed to be involved. The number of parimutuel clerks varies from 125 to 500, depending on the season, and they have about a dozen supervisors, racing officials said.</p>
        <p>The parimutuel, or betting, department of the racing association has been criticized for lax money-handling.</p>
        <p>The State Racing and Wagering Board, which oversees the racing association, has been pressing for an independent audit of the department since February 1999, but racing officials have resisted.</p>
        <p>The parimutuel clerks are given a sum of money at the beginning of a track's racing season and are expected to keep their own accounts straight until the end, when they must account for everything.</p>
        <p>Whenever a clerk takes in more than a stated maximum, which ranges from $2,000 to $10,000 depending on the size of the wager that can be made at the clerk's window, the excess must be turned over to a central ''money room,'' Mr. Imperato said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Imperato said supervisors opened and audited the clerks' boxes at least once every 10 weeks, but usually more often. Most clerks are audited once every three weeks, he said. Three to five clerks were subjected to surprise audits every day, he said.</p>
        <p>But in interviews yesterday at Belmont, several clerks, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that typically they were audited only three or four times a year. They said there were plenty of opportunities for dishonest clerks to take money out for their own uses, as long as it was returned.</p>
        <p>''I run my own store here,'' one clerk said.</p>
