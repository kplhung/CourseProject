        <p>Facing opposition from his military commanders, President Vladimir V. Putin postponed plans today to cut the armed forces by a third and said ''there will be no wholesale, massive reductions of the Russian armed forces.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin sounded a note of frustration at a meeting of his National Security Council with top military commanders present, saying, ''We spend colossal resources on the military, and we allow the military budget to be wasted on peripheral issues that have nothing in common with either the army's combat readiness nor with its direct supplies.''</p>
        <p>Therefore, he added, ''we don't have the right'' to make ''mechanical'' reductions in forces, but rather need to streamline the efficiency of the military. And, he added, ''we cannot any longer simply provide for the army's needs without also providing training with high technology and modern equipment.''</p>
        <p>His remarks seemed to undercut statements this month by Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev that between 2001 and 2003, Russian military ranks would be cut to 850,000 from the present level of 1.2 million, a reduction of just under one-third.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin said the issue of national defense could not be addressed ''by sheer enthusiasm'' in budget cutting, although he said the country was still spending far too much on the military establishment inherited from the Soviet Union. Military, law enforcement and security services take up about 35 percent of the Russian budget.</p>
        <p>He said the leaders of all departments with military units had raised objections to the reduction plans disclosed by Marshal Sergeyev.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov and Sergei Ivanov, secretary to the security council, recommended today that Mr. Putin put off any decisions until November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin said that despite the need for reductions, ''our army must be mobile, effective, flexible and combat capable.'' But he added, ''This does not mean that we have to follow the path of mechanical reduction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's remarks surprised some experts, coming as they did after the sinking of the nuclear submarine Kursk on Aug. 12 and the generally poor performance of the military in two inconclusive campaigns against the rebellious republic of Chechnya.</p>
        <p>The public perception that poor maintenance and safety standards in the Russian fleet contributed to the loss of the Kursk's 118-member crew created strong political momentum for military reform, including cuts in standing forces, which have declined to 1.2 million today from more than 2 million a decade ago.</p>
        <p>''I think Putin realizes that the only way he can eventually get a military that can do the job is to cut it drastically,'' said Dmitri V. Trenin, a former military officer and deputy director of the Moscow Carnegie Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trenin said he believed that Mr. Putin's decision to postpone his first round of cuts was more tactical than strategic. ''He prefers caution and nonconfrontation in dealing with the military,'' he said. ''Everyone knows that there is political support for improving defense, and that means cutting forces.''</p>
        <p>William E. Odom, a retired American general and longtime analyst of the Soviet and Russian military, expressed some doubt that Mr. Putin could carry through with significant cuts to forces or the defense budget.</p>
        <p>''If you look at Putin's public statements about foreign policy and the military, they all have the element of saying Russia must be a strong military power,'' General Odom said. ''Well, he is now being hoisted on that petard because Russia does not have the money to have a strong military.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Putin as a former K.G.B. officer and director of its successor Federal Security Service, is indebted to the military and security services for political support, and the war in Chechnya was a crucial factor in his political rise.</p>
        <p>At the Kremlin meeting, Mr. Ivanov, the security adviser, said Mr. Putin's decision was intended to give the military six more weeks to ''calculate once again all the economic parameters of the reforms that will be carried out pretty soon.''</p>
