      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Leave it to Barbra Streisand to turn her own life into a musical fairy tale, one with a resoundingly happy ending. That is the essence of the farewell show she brought to Madison Square Garden for two sold-out performances last night and this evening. The personal story she tells in songs and anecdotes is a variation on any number of myths in which a lonely, gifted child who never knew her father finds and marries a handsome prince and lives happily ever after. On the way, she also becomes queen of the Hollywood dream factory with her spellbinding voice.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streisand's show even includes a child version of herself: the gifted young singer Lauren Frost is used to fine dramatic effect playing the singer as an adolescent girl recording ''You'll Never Know.'' Ms. Streisand eventually chimes in. Later, in the most effective of several video sequences, Ms. Frost and Ms. Streisand rejoin voices with video images (two live and one from the movie ''Yentl'') singing ''Papa Can You Hear Me?'' The song is the touching climax to Ms. Streisand's anecdote about being sent a love letter her father wrote to a woman (not her mother) when he was 19.</p>

        <p>Leave it to Barbra Streisand to turn her own life into a musical fairy tale, one with a resoundingly happy ending. That is the essence of the farewell show she brought to Madison Square Garden for two sold-out performances last night and this evening. The personal story she tells in songs and anecdotes is a variation on any number of myths in which a lonely, gifted child who never knew her father finds and marries a handsome prince and lives happily ever after. On the way, she also becomes queen of the Hollywood dream factory with her spellbinding voice.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streisand's show even includes a child version of herself: the gifted young singer Lauren Frost is used to fine dramatic effect playing the singer as an adolescent girl recording ''You'll Never Know.'' Ms. Streisand eventually chimes in. Later, in the most effective of several video sequences, Ms. Frost and Ms. Streisand rejoin voices with video images (two live and one from the movie ''Yentl'') singing ''Papa Can You Hear Me?'' The song is the touching climax to Ms. Streisand's anecdote about being sent a love letter her father wrote to a woman (not her mother) when he was 19.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the show is a fairly straightforward career retrospective that carries the singer from that early recording session to nightclubs to Broadway, and finally to Hollywood and a late-blooming fairy-tale romance and marriage to the actor James Brolin. The closer it gets to the present, the more shamelessly sentimental the show becomes. The love songs that accompany Ms. Streisand's wedding and happily-ever-after pictures with Mr. Brolin are pure greeting-card mush. The wonder is that her voice can make even such singsong romantic doggerel sound, if not deep, at least deeply heartfelt.</p>
        <p>What's most surprising about Ms. Streisand's show is the degree to which her personal happiness has lightened up her singing. She has always been better in a relaxed, tender mode than in her steely stentorian one. In her recordings, especially recent ones, Ms. Streisand's perfectionist drive has tended to eradicate spontaneity in the quest for an inhuman technical perfection.</p>
        <p>Again and again, the singing conveyed a relaxed joy, a playful tenderness that rarely makes it to Ms. Streisand's recordings nowadays.  Among the many magical moments, some of the most memorable were a wistful ''The Way We Were,'' and a tender ''Something Wonderful,'' ''Alfie,'' ''Send in the Clowns'' and ''Don't Like Goodbyes.'' Among misfires, only two seriously grated: the frantic disco hit ''The Main Event,'' and an awkward beyond-the-grave video duet with Frank Sinatra on ''I've Got a Crush on You.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the concert reconfirmed Ms. Streisand's status as the last (and possibly greatest) true believer in the old romantic myths that are vanishing from pop. She's living proof that schoolgirl dreams really do come true, and that happy endings aren't just found in fairy tales. But if these are really her last concerts, her happy ending is our loss.</p>
