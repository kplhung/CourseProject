        <p>The Champagne will be flat by the time the Yankees get around to clinching the American League East. Heck, if they drag it out any longer, George Steinbrenner might disgustedly tell his players to split a six-pack of beer.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' magic number remains frozen at one, after last-place Tampa Bay crushed Denny Neagle and the Yankees tonight, 11-1 -- the Yankees' fifth loss in the last two weeks by 10 or more runs, their third straight defeat and their 11th in 14 games.</p>
        <p>It's almost impossible for the Yankees to lose the division race. They lead Toronto and Boston by four and a half games and these are all the things that would have to happen: the Blue Jays and Red Sox would have to win all of their remaining games, and the Yankees would have to lose here Thursday, lose three in Baltimore over the weekend, lose a makeup of a rainout against the Florida Marlins Monday and then lose an intra-division playoff Tuesday.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees have little chance to fully recoup the confidence they built in August and early September, when they took four of six games from Seattle and Oakland on a road trip and swept three games from the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>''We've got to realize we're in control of this thing,'' Scott Brosius said. ''We've got to relax. We're going to win this division; we've just got to relax and do it.''</p>
        <p>At least some of the doubts that have grown over the last two weeks -- about the bullpen, about an offense starved for hits, about Neagle and his propensity for implosion -- are assured of carrying over into the playoffs, and there is a strong chance that the Yankees will open the postseason on the road, something they have not done since 1981.</p>
        <p>At the moment their game concluded here tonight, the Yankees had the fourth-best record in the league.</p>
        <p>''We have to win a game, we have to start playing better, and that time was yesterday,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''Tonight was an embarrassment, and we need to do something about it.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner lives in the Tampa area, and within the Yankees' organization, it is widely accepted that beating the Devil Rays is only slightly less important than winning the World Series and world peace.</p>
        <p>If there was one positive to be drawn from the slump that began with a 3-2 loss to Toronto Sept. 14, it was that the Yankees were presented with the opportunity to come here and obliterate the Devil Rays in Steinbrenner's neighborhood and spray Champagne all over Tampa Bay property.</p>
        <p>But the Devil Rays edged the Yankees, 2-1, on Tuesday, and Steinbrenner vacated his private box without stopping by the clubhouse. He spoke with Torre and General Manager Brian Cashman before the game and was here again tonight to see Neagle, who was yanked after pitching just three innings.</p>
        <p>Neagle's career record is 105-68 and for a pitcher with his track record, he has had an unusual problem since joining the Yankees. Neagle will make a mechanical mistake, such as rushing his delivery or drawing his weight back too far, and rather than correct the problem -- he must have had some success doing this as a major league pitcher -- Neagle has repeated the mistake or tried too hard to compensate for his error.</p>
        <p>He retired the Devil Rays in order in the first inning, easily, a couple of fly balls and a grounder. Then Fred McGriff blistered a line drive at Chuck Knoblauch leading off the second, for an out, and the hard shot seemed to unnerve Neagle.</p>
        <p>Ozzie Timmons singled to left center. John Flaherty walked, only his 19th walk in 389 plate appearances. Neagle got ahead of Jose Guillen one ball and two strikes and grooved a fastball over the inner half of the plate. Guillen smashed a three-run homer.</p>
        <p>Neagle is a high-energy personality to begin with, someone who talks at the speed of sound, and the home run caused him to pace across the mound frenetically.</p>
        <p>He fell behind Bobby Smith two balls and no strikes, and the interim pitching coach Billy Connors walked out to calm him.</p>
        <p>Neagle threw two more pitches out of the strike zone, another walk, then shot a glance in the direction of the Yankees' dugout.</p>
        <p>Neagle tried picking off Smith at first and fired the ball 10 feet wide of  first baseman Tino Martinez for a two-base error; Smith scored on a squeeze. Neagle allowed a home run to McGriff in the third, and Torre -- who seems totally befuddled by Neagle's problems -- chose to replace Neagle with the rookie Randy Keisler.</p>
        <p>Torre's decision disappointed Neagle.</p>
        <p>''I hope I still have the confidence from my manager that he knows he can use me in any situation,'' Neagle said. ''I'll make myself available for relief the last couple of games in Baltimore, the first round, the first couple of games of the league championship series. I haven't lost any confidence in myself; I know what I'm doing wrong.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees traded for Neagle when he was 8-2 with a 3.52 earned run average for the Cincinnati Reds. His record with the Yankees is 7-7 with a 5.68 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>In his last three starts of the regular season, Neagle pitched a total of 10 2/3 innings and allowed 19 runs, 18 earned. It might be mechanical trouble, it might be because of the pressure of being a hired gun without a contract for next year, it might be because negotiations are continuing and Neagle might feel some pressure to justify his agent's request for a contract of at least $10 million a year.</p>
        <p>Whatever the source, Neagle's pitching is a problem, and if the Yankees somehow found themselves in the position of facing elimination in Game 4 of the playoffs, it would not be hard to imagine their turning to Roger Clemens on three days' rest, or using Dwight Gooden.</p>
        <p>But Neagle is only one symptom of a malaise that has overcome the Yankees, who seem destined to crawl into the playoffs.</p>
