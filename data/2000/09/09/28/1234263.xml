        <p>The historic paradigm of perseverance in the face of repeated defeats is Robert the Bruce of Scotland, who gloomily watched a spider's untiring efforts in web-building and then led his oft-beaten army into battle one more time and defeated the English at Bannockburn.</p>
        <p>The modern bridge equivalent of Robert, or perhaps of the spider, is John Rengstorff, long one of New York's leading players. He first played in the Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship in 1969, and he won the title for the first time a month ago on his 32nd attempt, going through unbeaten. With his teammates Adam Wildavsky, Jim Krekorian, Marty Fleisher, Chris Willenken and Jesus Arias, he surged to victory in the second half of the final against a once-beaten group consisting of Jon Greenspan, Jim Sampson, Glenn Milgrim, Jared Lilienstein, Kent Mignocchi and Bjorn Fallenius.</p>

        <p>The modern bridge equivalent of Robert, or perhaps of the spider, is John Rengstorff, long one of New York's leading players. He first played in the Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship in 1969, and he won the title for the first time a month ago on his 32nd attempt, going through unbeaten. With his teammates Adam Wildavsky, Jim Krekorian, Marty Fleisher, Chris Willenken and Jesus Arias, he surged to victory in the second half of the final against a once-beaten group consisting of Jon Greenspan, Jim Sampson, Glenn Milgrim, Jared Lilienstein, Kent Mignocchi and Bjorn Fallenius.</p>
        <p>Rengstorff's favorite Von Zedtwitz deal, shown in the diagram, goes back some 30 years. He sat South, and after he opened one no-trump, his partner simply raised to game. That could easily have been wrong, since South could have had weakness in spades and a fit in a minor suit, but in those days there was no alternative. Many modern experts have artificial methods to solve this common problem.</p>
        <p>West had to guess which major suit to lead, and guessed right by leading a heart. His selection was the deuce, which was not, however, the familiar fourth-best. It was ''attitude,'' indicating strength in the suit, and neither East nor South could tell whether West held four or five cards. This proved to be crucial.</p>
        <p>South played low from dummy, won with the heart jack, and considered his prospects. He had to hope for an even heart split, and even at that he would need considerable luck in the minor suits. The normal line of play was to lead to the club queen, planning to finesse the 10 subsequently. If that succeeded, he would have to hope that the diamond king would provide an entry to the dummy. Another possibility was to lead diamonds, hoping for a doubleton ace in the West hand.</p>
        <p>Instead Rengstorff made the surprising play of the club king, which preserved his entry chances in both minor suits. West won with the ace and continued hearts, knocking out dummy's ace. The contract was in theory doomed at this point, but when a diamond was led from dummy, East, in difficulty, misread the position. He feared that South was attempting to steal a ninth trick, so he put up the ace in the hope that his partner had three heart winners to cash. But there were only two, and South took the remaining tricks to make a game that failed by three tricks in the replay.</p>
        <p>In the post-mortem the defenders no doubt considered the possibility of reverting to the traditional fourth-best lead, which would have solved the defensive problem by clarifying the length of West's suit.</p>
