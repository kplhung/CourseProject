        <p>Saying that more effective AIDS prevention could avert thousands of new infections each year in this country, the nation's leading science organization sharply criticized the Clinton administration today for what it said was a failure to develop a comprehensive and effective plan to combat the disease.</p>

        <p>Saying that more effective AIDS prevention could avert thousands of new infections each year in this country, the nation's leading science organization sharply criticized the Clinton administration today for what it said was a failure to develop a comprehensive and effective plan to combat the disease.</p>
        <p>''There is a definite lack of federal leadership with regard to H.I.V. prevention,'' and ''there is no time to lose,'' the organization, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, said in a strongly worded report that called for a new national strategy in combating H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>The report called on the government to improve its tracking of new H.I.V. infections to help communities better implement appropriate prevention services, develop better sex education programs, help deliver more public health messages to overcome complacency about the seriousness of the epidemic and provide more money for needle exchange and treatment programs for injecting drug users. It also called on health insurance organizations to pay for the time it takes for doctors to deliver prevention messages as part of clinical care.</p>
        <p>Federal, state and local laws and policies that hinder proven prevention strategies should be abolished, the report said. It said the government spends $250 million over five years for sex education programs that emphasize only abstinence without any evidence that such efforts are effective in preventing H.I.V. infections.</p>
        <p>''Yet comprehensive sex education and condom availability, which have been shown to reduce the risk of H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases without promoting sexual activity, are not always supported,'' said Dr. Harvey V. Fineberg, the provost of Harvard University and co-chairman of the committee that wrote the report.</p>
        <p>The report also urged the government to revise the way it spends the $775 million for prevention each year and to adopt a specific plan to sharply reduce the estimated 40,000 new cases a year, a figure that has been stable since 1992. The figure contrasts with the 160,000 new infections that occurred at the peak of the epidemic in this country in the mid-1980's, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
        <p>''It is outrageous that the rates of new H.I.V. infections in the United States have stayed consistently at 40,000 a year,'' Ronald Johnson, the associate executive director of the Gay Men's Health Crisis of New York City, said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fineberg, who is an expert in public health, said that ''thousands of new H.I.V. infections could be avoided each year if we gave greater emphasis to prevention and were smarter in the way we spent our prevention dollars.''</p>
        <p>While the goal may seem obvious, ''many current H.I.V. prevention efforts do not operate with this objective in mind,'' Dr. Fineberg said at a news conference at the institute's headquarters here.</p>
        <p>Sandra L. Thurman, who directs the White House Office on National AIDS Policy, said in an interview that ''the report is important because it gives us a yardstick to measure our progress and to take a hard look at our current investments at C.D.C.''</p>
        <p>''We need to look at the criticism and take it very seriously,'' Ms. Thurman said. ''We have a fluid epidemic, and there is a sense of urgency particularly among minority and other communities hardest hit.''</p>
        <p>The report said women, young people and members of minorities now accounted for a growing proportion of new AIDS cases.</p>
        <p>The report renewed calls to increase financing so more drug abusers could be enrolled in treatment and needle exchange programs.</p>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal agency in Atlanta responsible for tracking the AIDS epidemic, commissioned the study and asked the committee to come up with a framework for H.I.V. prevention. Responding to the report, Dr. Helene Gayle, the director of the AIDS program at the centers, said her agency was in general agreement with the recommendations.</p>
        <p>For example, Dr. Gayle said, the agency has issued a draft of its plan that aims to reduce by half the annual incidence of new H.I.V. infections by 2005.</p>
        <p>The report said ''there must be a strong, clear leadership structure in the Department of Health and Human Services.''</p>
        <p>Because many agencies share responsibility for federal H.I.V. prevention activities, the agencies compete for resources and public attention and ''there is no explicit strategy that currently guides the overall investment of federal H.I.V. prevention funds,'' the panel said.</p>
        <p>The basis of financing should be preventing the greatest number of infections for a given amount of money, the report said, adding that the government ''should be held accountable'' for such decisions.</p>
        <p>The report urged wider application of a testing method C.D.C. has developed that tells more accurately than current tests when a person was infected, allowing public health officials to determine where the epidemic is heading.</p>
        <p>The report said it would be more cost-effective to spend money on needle exchange programs and preventing infections among newborns than developing tests to screen for tainted blood, which can be very expensive.</p>
        <p>The report said that testing and treating pregnant women cost about $32,000 for each infection prevented and that needle exchange programs cost $3,000 to $50,000 for each infection prevented but that screening blood for transfusions cost $7.5 million for each infection averted.</p>
        <p>''It is difficult to reconcile a difference of such magnitude,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Edward H. Kaplan, a professor at the Yale School of Management, said the report, which he co-wrote, should be regarded as a blueprint for the next White House administration.</p>
