        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton began a three-day fund-raising trip outside  New York yesterday with a visit to Oklahoma City, where her host was a former state attorney general who came under scrutiny in one of the fund-raising investigations involving her husband's re-election.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton then held an event in Las Vegas last night, and after that  travels to the Los Angeles area for two days.</p>
        <p>Her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, has criticized her for relying heavily on contributions from Hollywood celebrities, a traditional fund-raising source for Democrats, and at first, her aides would not disclose the names of sponsors of the California events.</p>
        <p>They later acknowledged that one host would be Cher. The others include the financier Marvin Davis and his wife, Barbara.</p>
        <p>Most of the money from the fund-raising trip is expected to go to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign, but she also plans to collect soft money for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.</p>
        <p>In the New York contest, she and her Democratic allies have tentatively agreed not to spend soft money -- the largely unregulated contributions collected by parties in an effort to circumvent contribution limits -- under an arrangement with Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton, who headed West after addressing an economic forum at Columbia University yesterday morning, has said she will continue to raise soft money, which would be used to help other Democrats, not her candidacy, as long as the New York arrangement stands.</p>
        <p>Over all, Mrs. Clinton has received about 60 percent of her campaign contributions from out of state, more than Mr. Lazio or most Senate candidates.</p>
        <p>''Rick Lazio has a clear financial advantage in this race because he has raised millions out-of-state with his insult-filled direct mail,'' said Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign. ''As a result, we have to work harder to be competitive.''</p>
        <p>In Oklahoma City yesterday, the host for a fund-raising luncheon for Mrs. Clinton was Michael Turpen, the former state attorney general and one of the state's most prominent Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turpen's fund-raising activities were examined by Congressional Republicans in 1997 after he raised a large donation for the Democratic National Committee from an Indian tribe in Oklahoma that has sought to reclaim federal land that the tribe believes was stolen from it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Turpen had been hired as a lobbyist by the tribe, the Cheyenne-Arapaho. He suggested to tribal leaders that they could gain access to federal officials if they pledged a $100,000 donation to the Democrats, tribal leaders said.</p>
        <p>The leaders were soon invited to a lunch with President Clinton at the White House, where they asked him for help on the land issue. The president, according to the tribal leaders, said he would look into the matter.</p>
        <p>The president ultimately took no action, and after the circumstances surrounding the donation were publicized, the Democratic National Committee returned the money. But Republicans in Congress who investigated the affair called it part of a pattern of Democratic fund-raising abuses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said the fund-raiser sponsored by Mr. Turpen yesterday was ''perfectly legal and appropriate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Turpen did not respond to two messages left for him.</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, sent a letter to the National Abortion Rights Action League, requesting that it refrain from airing any advertising attacking Mr. Lazio for his position on abortion, in deference to the agreement between the Lazio and Clinton campaigns.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the group had initially chafed at the deal, arguing that it interfered with their rights. After meeting yesterday, board members said they would unveil a new advertisement today, but pointedly did not say whether the advertisement would be aired.</p>
        <p>Several Democrats said last night it was likely that NARAL would unveil the ad today, expecting that it would be the subject of news reports, but would not buy ad time in deference to the deal.</p>
