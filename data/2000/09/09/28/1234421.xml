        <p>Owens Corning, the home improvement and building materials company, said yesterday that it would consolidate its account by naming Doner in Southfield, Mich., to handle duties ranging from advertising to media services to interactive assignments. Billings were estimated at $30 million to $40 million.</p>
        <p>Lynne Hartzell, director for marketing communications at Owens Corning in Toledo, Ohio, said the decision came after a six-month review that had been narrowed to Doner; Fahlgren in Dublin, Ohio, the lead incumbent on the account for about seven years; and several agencies she declined to identify. In addition to Fahlgren, Owens Corning had used seven shops to handle specialty tasks like interactive ads and point-of-sale materials.</p>
