        <p>As the United States closed in on a remarkable victory over Cuba tonight, Bob Watson, the man who helped put the team together, rose from his seat behind home plate and began to accept congratulations. When Mike Neill made a sliding catch of Yasser Gomez's fly ball to left to seal Ben Sheets's three-hit shutout, the emotion that had been building since the middle of the third inning exploded in chants and cheers. Watson and his wife, Carol, were right there in the middle of it all.</p>
        <p>The United States upset Cuba, 4-0, to win its first Olympic gold medal in baseball. The victory was not met with the cascades of emotion that Cathy Freeman of Australia received on Tuesday -- nothing the United States will do here will equal those -- but it came close.</p>
        <p>The United States baseball team had done the impossible. Four days after being vanquished by mighty Cuba, ruler of international baseball for decades, a United States team mixed with minor leaguers past their prime and young players still short of theirs snapped Cuba's domination. This team won the United States' first official Olympic gold medal in the sport known as the American pastime.</p>
        <p>True, the United States won the gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, but baseball was a demonstration sport that year and -- more important -- Cuba boycotted those Games. But Cuba, the two-time defending gold medalist, had been front and center in international baseball for a long time, and Cuban scouts said this team was one of their country's best.</p>
        <p>''Those guys pitching for the Cubans can go right into the majors,'' said Tommy Lasorda, the United States' manager. ''But it's not always the best team that wins or the strongest man who wins the fight. In most cases, it's who wants it more than the other. We wanted it more than the other.''</p>
        <p>The United States jumped on Cuba immediately. Neill's solo home run in the first inning set the tone; three runs in the fifth sealed Cuba's fate. With a 4-0 lead, Sheets, 22, was untouchable.</p>
        <p>After Cuba won the gold in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 and repeated at Atlanta in 1996, Watson, the former major league player and general manager, was part of a delegation to put together a team of professional players who would stand up to the Cubans. This eclectic group of players rose to the challenge.</p>
        <p>After tonight's game, Lasorda gushed -- as only he can -- that this was larger than winning a World Series ring, that he felt more excited about Neill's home run than he did about Kirk Gibson's famous pinch-hit homer in the 1988 World Series.</p>
        <p>''The other one was for a team,'' Lasorda said. ''This is bigger than the World Series; I managed in four World Series -- it's bigger. When the Dodgers win a championship, the Dodger fans were happy. Today, the United States of America is happy.''</p>
        <p>This victory did not have the suddenness of the Miracle on Ice in 1980 at Lake Placid, when a young American hockey team upset the powerful, unbeaten Russians. This was closer to an extended rescue mission.</p>
        <p>The national pastime had been appropriated by Cuba, which has dominated not only the United States team but all others in international baseball for decades. The Cubans were 64-1 in international tournaments between 1986 and 1992.</p>
        <p>The perplexing question for the United States was two-fold:</p>
        <p>How could the nation that invented the game, a nation in which baseball's mythology is so much a part of its character, a nation whose lore and spirit is wrapped up in the game, be so thoroughly dominated by an island nation a fraction of its size?</p>
        <p>The other question, expressed as a doubt, was: Could this team break down a teamful of stars?</p>
        <p>''When this team was picked,'' said Doug Mientkiewicz, the United States' first baseman, ''a lot of people looked at the names on the list and asked: 'Who are these guys? Who are they sending over?' That was the motivating factor for me.''</p>
        <p>Someone asked Cuba's manager, Servio Borges, whether his team's loss to the United States signaled the end of an era for Cuba, too. He said no, quite the contrary. ''A new era is just beginning,'' he said. ''This is the beginning.''</p>
        <p>In a way, Cuba tonight became the victim of its own success in the game.</p>
        <p>The Cubans forced the United States to get better, to drop college players from its team and enlist toughened professionals to uphold the nation's baseball image.</p>
        <p>For Cuba, the question is: Now what?</p>
        <p>''Now we have to work harder,'' Borges said.</p>
        <p>At the heart and soul of this United States team were three players whose best days as major leaguers were behind them. The grit came from them. Ernie Young, the 31-year-old right fielder who now plays in the Pacific Coast League in the St. Louis Cardinals organization, broke the game open with a bases-loaded single. Pat Borders, the 37-year-old catcher who plays with Class AAA Durham for the Tampa Bay Devils Rays, delivered an R.B.I. double. And Neill, 30, who is with Class AAA Tacoma in the Seattle Mariners' system, had the early home run.</p>
        <p>The future of the United States team rests with a pitcher like Sheets, who is just beginning his career in the Milwaukee Brewers' system. Sheets, who signed the highest bonus in Brewers history, played at Class A Huntsville and Class AAA Indianapolis this season. He should move into the major league rotation next year.</p>
        <p>''When we first got here I predicted that when this is all over, everybody in the world is going to know about these players.'' Lasorda said. ''By golly, they know now that these guys are outstanding.''</p>
