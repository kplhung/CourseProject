        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Ways to Keep Out Broadband Hackers'' (Q &amp; A, Sept. 21) did not point out that the real danger of a cable modem is not just the fact that it's ''always on.'' While having what amounts to a fixed I.P. address can give a hacker an opportunity to snoop around your machine or use it for an attack, there is an even greater hazard in not having a ''dedicated line'' connection to your I.S.P. With a cable modem, the connection to your home is shared by several of your neighbors, if not by your entire community if your cable company has been lazy about security. Packets destined for your machine are sent, along with everyone else's in your area, with the cable signal. Unscrupulous or otherwise curious neighbors can inspect the packets coming into their own connections and discern your name, I.P. address, sites you're visiting and a host of other tidbits you'd probably not want to share with everyone. Without a firewall plan that includes some sort of I.P. masking or chaining, a cable modem can be dangerous.</p>
