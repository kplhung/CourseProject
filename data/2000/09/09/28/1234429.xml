        <p>Several Mets sliced or peeled away the splashy green posters that adorned the strips of plastic covering their lockers in the Champagne-soaked clubhouse. The posters declared the Mets as the wild-card entrant from the National League, and some players obviously wanted to bring these posters home. They had earned it.</p>
        <p>After taming the Braves, 6-2, the Mets finally clinched a postseason spot and found a reason to like September. The clubhouse scenes last night at Shea Stadium were a reversal from the previous night. While the Mets acted boisterously and drank Champagne quickly, the Braves, who had won the National League East title and celebrated on Tuesday night, ate quietly or dressed quickly.</p>
        <p>''I think that this team has silenced a little bit of the doubters,'' Mets catcher Mike Piazza said. ''You know what? We had a bad month. Hopefully, we can have a good month.''</p>
        <p>The Mets are 5-7 against Atlanta this season, and they have lost 20 of their last 23 games at Turner Field; they usually turn to jelly against the Braves. Since the Mets have failed to leap over the Braves and have settled for the wild card for the last two seasons, they must have felt relief and satisfaction about clinching against Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''Getting into the playoffs, we would have been happy if this was a Little League team,'' Robin Ventura said.</p>
        <p>While Bobby Valentine proudly said the Mets had proved that ''we can beat anyone,'' Al Leiter admitted that the wild card was bittersweet since the goal was to finish in first place. Valentine initially talked about resting most of his starters tonight, but Leiter emphasized the potential importance of one more victory against Greg Maddux and the Braves.</p>
        <p>''Tomorrow would be a nice win to put us at 6-7 against them,'' Leiter said. ''There's something to be said for that if we meet in the postseason.''</p>
        <p>Before the Mets prevailed, Chipper Jones was asked to try to explain the unexplainable. Why do the Braves thoroughly dominate the Mets? The Braves are a better team, but they are not so superior that the rivalry should be lopsided.</p>
        <p>The question has been asked for months, but Jones provided an interesting response. He did not talk about superior pitching, superior hitting or karma. He spoke about the fierce feeling the Braves have whenever they oppose the Mets.</p>
        <p>''Guys in here really get up to play the Mets,'' Jones said. ''If we had this intensity for 162 games, we'd do something that would rival what the Yankees did when they won 114 in the regular season and 125 over all. We would rival that.''</p>
        <p>Jones was not talking trash. He was simply being honest and, in a way, he was complimenting the Mets. But it was a revealing statement. For Jones to even speculate that if they played this way for the entire season, the Braves would compare to the 1998 Yankees, whose 125 victories were more than any team in major league history, was an intriguing explanation for the way the Braves handle the Mets.</p>
        <p>''Whenever we play them, a switch goes off in the clubhouse,'' said Jones, who had an uncharacteristic 0-for-2 night. ''We know that we've got to play well to beat these guys and keep them at arm's length.''</p>
        <p>Center fielder Andruw Jones made it seem as if another wasted evening was ahead for the Mets when he drilled one of Rick Reed's first pitches for a homer in the first inning. The 23-year-old Jones also doubled and was robbed of another extra-base hit by Derek Bell, who crashed into the right field fence to make a gorgeous catch. Jones admitted that playing the Mets is different for him, too.</p>
        <p>''It's just exciting to play against a team that is right behind you,'' Andruw Jones said. ''I think we would all like the team to play the way we do whenever we play New York. When we play New York, we play on a different level.''</p>
        <p>The Braves lost last night, but they are usually a crisp, confident team against the Mets. Chipper Jones has a .370 career average against the Mets and he sealed the Most Valuable Player award last year by smashing four homers off them in a three-game sweep in September of 1999. So, despite the Mets' celebration, Chipper Jones has reasons to feel that the Braves can be like the 1998 Yankees.</p>
        <p>''Everyone has a team that they do good against,'' he said. ''For me, it's the Mets. I can't understand it and I'm not going to try and explain it.''</p>
