        <p>Both the Republican and Democratic Party organizations, using soft money, are outspending special interest groups and the Bush and Gore campaigns on television in the presidential elections, say researchers monitoring paid political advertising.</p>
        <p>The pattern is a departure from previous election cycles, when the candidates' campaign organizations paid for the majority of their commercials and spent far more money than the parties, the researchers say.</p>
        <p>This time, the candidates of both parties are benefiting as never before from advertising paid for with soft money, the unregulated party donations by corporations and wealthy individuals. The candidates' campaign organizations are barred from accepting more than $2,000 from any one individual.</p>
        <p>The use of soft money has become an issue in many of the highest profile political campaigns, including the New York Senate race, where Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio have tentatively agreed to a ban on soft money in campaign advertising. Yesterday, Vice President Al Gore, in response to a call by two senators for similar limits in the presidential race, challenged Gov. George W. Bush to accept such a ban. [Page A23.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said he does not favor soft money restrictions because he does not trust the Democrats to abide by them.</p>
        <p>The latest indication that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are using the national parties as their major advertisers for this year came in a study on television spending yesterday by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. The report showed that from June 1 to Sept. 20, the two parties had spent more than $52 million on commercials, while the Bush and Gore campaigns had spent less than half that, about $21 million.</p>
        <p>The study, produced with Ken Goldstein, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin, found that the trend was holding up this month, traditionally the time when the candidates, flush with the proceeds from the federal money allotted them after the conventions, have taken over much of the responsibility for running commercials. Four years ago, for example, Bob Dole's campaign ran 6,100 spots and President Clinton's 3,600 spots the first full week after Labor Day, the Brennan Center found. That same week, the Republican Party ran just 147 commercials and the Democratic Party a mere one.</p>
        <p>This year, however, the parties have shown no sign of letting up. Brennan Center researchers found that in the seven days that ended Sept. 20, the two parties were still the biggest spenders: The Republican Party spent nearly $2.3 million on television that week, or $300,000 more than the Bush campaign. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, spent $1.8 million, or about $700,000 more than the Gore campaign. Special interest groups spent a total of about $1.1 million on the two candidates across the country.</p>
        <p>''What's confirmed this week is that for the first time in history, the political parties are dominating the ad wars in the presidential campaign,'' said E. Joshua Rosenkranz, president of Brennan, a legal and research center that has developed a specialty in campaign finance issues.</p>
        <p>The data also highlight the evolution over the years in the roles of the Democratic and Republican national committees, which once had little to do with the marketing of a nominee. ''Twenty years ago, I don't know if the R.N.C. and D.N.C. were doing much more than sponsoring brochures,'' said William Benoit, a professor of communication at the University of Missouri who has studied 50 years of campaign advertising.</p>
        <p>Although officials on both sides maintain that the parties and campaigns operate independently, others acknowledge privately that the issue of which entity is spending the money has become meaningless. Last month for example, the Republican National Committee withdrew a commercial questioning Mr. Gore's veracity after Mr. Bush objected to it, even though some of his advisers had wanted it to run.</p>
        <p>Neither party disputed the Brennan Center's findings, but some officials cautioned that the portrait of spending could change as Election Day draws nearer, and the campaigns more aggressively spend the remainder of the $67 million in federal money, or hard money, each has been allocated for the fall campaign. The Brennan Center study noted that the Bush campaign has spent $13 million on television since June 1, and the Gore campaign $8 million.</p>
        <p>''Nobody is going to have money in the bank at the end of this campaign,'' a Republican official said.</p>
        <p>Still, there is a general acknowledgment on both sides that the parties have become more active in selling the candidates than ever before, and that they have been elevated at least to a partnership with the campaigns on advertising, the costliest aspect of a presidential race.</p>
        <p>The likely outcome in November, said another Republican campaign official, is a kind of parity among the parties and campaigns, with each of the four entities spending $40 million to $50 million on advertising. That would still represent a heightened participation this year by the parties.</p>
        <p>The competitiveness of the campaign may also be a factor. Joe Andrew, national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said the party initially had no plans to continue running spots after the conventions, but the strategy changed because the Republicans were advertising so heavily at the time. ''They chose to run issue advertising after the convention and we chose to defend our record and continue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Republicans expect no respite either. ''What we're seeing here is a sustained effort by both the party and the campaign, and it's unlikely that it will let up until the last ballot is cast,'' said Clifford D. May, the communications director for the Republican National Committee.</p>
        <p>Political analysts say that the parties' intensifying roles have further blurred the distinctions not only between the candidates and the parties, but also between the kinds of commercials. Political parties are barred from running commercials that engage in electioneering, an activity defined by the courts as employing such explicit terms as ''vote for'' or ''defeat.'' They are instead supposed to run only ''issue ads,'' commercials intended for activities like party-building.</p>
        <p>The distinctions were all but erased in the last presidential campaign, when President Clinton's advisers devised a way of running spots for his re-election without depleting the campaign's money. Featuring Mr. Clinton -- but not those magic words, ''vote for'' -- the strategists were able to pay for the commercials with Democratic Party money.</p>
        <p>The Republicans later used a similar tactic in Mr. Dole's campaign.</p>
        <p>Although the practice was challenged by Common Cause, a group that advocates campaign finance reform, no action was taken. In 1998, the Federal Election Commission rejected the recommendation of its own auditors and general counsel that the Clinton and Dole campaigns be forced to repay $25 million for what they concluded was the illegal coordination of their advertising with their parties.</p>
        <p>Darrell West, a Brown University political scientist who analyzes campaign commercials, said enforcement was so lax that the parties were essentially engaging in ''direct candidate advocacy'' with impunity.</p>
        <p>''It used to be that soft money was designed for party building and get out the vote efforts,'' Mr. Brown said. ''Now we've ended up in a situation where much of the ad money is being funneled through the parties.''</p>
        <p>To some monitoring the process, the blurring of the lines only strengthens the arguments of those who contend that the next president will be beholden to special interests.</p>
        <p>''The two major party presidential candidates made a deal with the public, and the deal is we will accept an enormous amount of federal money in return for the promise not to raise private money for our campaigns,'' said Mr. Rosenkranz of the Brennan Center. ''That deal has broken down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Andrew, the Democratic chairman, said his hope had been that the party ''would be a full partner in the campaign.'' But he added, ''It's not a positive development that we're spending so much money to do that.''</p>
