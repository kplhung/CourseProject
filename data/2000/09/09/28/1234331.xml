        <p>The heated auction of the Rihga Royal Hotel has come to an end, with Strategic Hotel Capital emerging as the victorious buyer of the 54-story tower on West 54th Street, between Seventh Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, according to hotel and real estate executives.</p>
        <p>Strategic Hotel Capital, which bought the Essex House on Central Park South last year, has agreed to buy the Rihga, which has 500 suites, for about $220 million from the Rihga Royal Hotel Group of Osaka, Japan, the executives said.

        <p>The heated auction of the Rihga Royal Hotel has come to an end, with Strategic Hotel Capital emerging as the victorious buyer of the 54-story tower on West 54th Street, between Seventh Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, according to hotel and real estate executives.</p>
        <p>Strategic Hotel Capital, which bought the Essex House on Central Park South last year, has agreed to buy the Rihga, which has 500 suites, for about $220 million from the Rihga Royal Hotel Group of Osaka, Japan, the executives said. Strategic is planning to bring in the Regent company to manage the pink brick hotel, whose top-of-the-line Grand Royal Suites rent for about $3,300 a night.</p>
        <p>Lazard Freres, the investment bank that represented the Japanese company in the sale, would not comment. And Laurence Geller, the president of Strategic Hotel Capital, said there had not been a final resolution.</p>
        <p>''I would love to be the owner,'' Mr. Geller said. ''But nothing's been done. There are still loads of people looking at it.''</p>
        <p>Though a final contract has not been signed, real estate and hotel executives said the hotel had been taken off the market and Strategic had signed a letter of intent.</p>
        <p>The Rihga Royal would be Strategic's third hotel in New York. The privately held company, which owns about three dozen luxury hotels in the United States, Mexico and Europe, bought the 597-room Essex House for about $250 million and the 643-room Marriott East Side on Lexington Avenue in 1998.</p>
        <p>With the city's hotels full a good portion of the year and room rates rising at a rapid clip, the sale of the Rihga Royal drew about 10 eager bidders when it went on the block this summer. But it was not cheap. ''Anyone under $200 million was not in the game,'' said one hotel executive.</p>
        <p>''It's a nice price for a hotel that's in great condition in an up-and-coming area,'' said John Fox, a principal at PKF Consulting, a hotel consulting firm. ''This is a booming business right now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox said the city's hotels ''basically sell out 250 nights a year.'' In the first eight months of this year, the average hotel occupancy rate in Manhattan was 84 percent, up from 79 percent during the same period in 1999. At the same time, the average room rate rose 8 percent to $219.43.</p>
        <p>Business has been so good that few hotels have come on the market in the last year or so. But the Japanese company that owned the Rihga Royal, which opened in 1990, expanded rapidly in the 1980's and, like many Asian real estate companies, has been forced to sell properties in recent years to pay off debts.</p>
        <p>The Rihga was particularly attractive, said Arthur Adler, managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle, because it is rare in New York to be able to buy a relatively new hotel and install a new operator. Analysts expect that the new owners will be able to take advantage of an international sales and marketing network to raise room rates and, possibly, increase the occupancy.</p>
