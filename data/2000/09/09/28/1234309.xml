        <p>The problem with 10-year-olds is that they're disorganized, they're constantly late and they've always got their heads buried in some video game when they should be doing homework.</p>
        <p>But thanks to a new cartridge for the GameBoy, they've run out of excuses for their poor behavior.</p>
        <p>The Shark MX from Interact Accessories is an application that enables the GameBoy to send and receive electronic messages to and from any other e-mail account.</p>
        <p>The Shark MX also comes with an address book, a calendar and a calculator so that owners can figure out just how much of their day is devoted to Donkey Kong.</p>
        <p>Not much larger than a typical game cartridge, the Shark MX can connect to Interact's servers through any regular phone line.</p>
        <p>After setting up an e-mail account at Gamesharker.com, players can use their well-muscled thumbs to compose e-mail messages on an onscreen keypad.</p>
        <p>The device is $39.99 and comes with 30 free minutes of connection time. Each 60 minutes of additional time is $6, and the calls to Interact's servers are toll free -- cheaper than a BlackBerry pager or a Palm VII and a lot less likely to be lost.</p>
