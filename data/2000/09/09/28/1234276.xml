        <p>Brian Leerhuber, a gifted 27-year-old baritone, inaugurated this season's On Wings of Song voice recital series at the Kosciuszko Foundation on Sunday afternoon, accompanied by the pianist Michael Baitzer, a member of the vocal arts faculty at the Juilliard School. These noteworthy events are sponsored by the Marilyn Horne Foundation, whose mission is to present young singers in recitals across the United States.</p>
        <p>There are many appealing aspects to Mr. Leerhuber's artistry. He has a husky voice, stage presence and vitality. He is clearly an intelligent musician who selected an interesting program. The first part, devoted to Schubert, was titled ''Songs of Gods and Heroes.'' The second part, ''Serenades,'' offered songs by Wolf, Mendelssohn, Gounod and Strauss. The last set, ''Nocturnes,'' was a fascinating mix of works by Debussy, Ives, Griffes, Cole Porter and Mary Carr Moore.</p>

        <p>Brian Leerhuber, a gifted 27-year-old baritone, inaugurated this season's On Wings of Song voice recital series at the Kosciuszko Foundation on Sunday afternoon, accompanied by the pianist Michael Baitzer, a member of the vocal arts faculty at the Juilliard School. These noteworthy events are sponsored by the Marilyn Horne Foundation, whose mission is to present young singers in recitals across the United States.</p>
        <p>There are many appealing aspects to Mr. Leerhuber's artistry. He has a husky voice, stage presence and vitality. He is clearly an intelligent musician who selected an interesting program. The first part, devoted to Schubert, was titled ''Songs of Gods and Heroes.'' The second part, ''Serenades,'' offered songs by Wolf, Mendelssohn, Gounod and Strauss. The last set, ''Nocturnes,'' was a fascinating mix of works by Debussy, Ives, Griffes, Cole Porter and Mary Carr Moore.</p>
        <p>That said, Mr. Leerhuber tends to push his voice unnecessarily. He does make quite a bit of sound, but at the expense of his softer singing, which sometimes sounded breathy and dry. Forcing his voice was especially unnecessary in the warm, intimate wood-paneled salon room at the Kosciuszko Foundation, where the acoustics, if anything, are overly bright.</p>
        <p>It was good to hear Mr. Leerhuber scale down his sound in Gounod's ''Serenade,'' in which he did his most lyrically elegant work, complete with a quite passable trill. But in two Porter songs, ''In the Still of the Night'' and ''Night and Day,'' the second offered as an encore, he sang like a caricature of an operatic baritone, with overblown sound and unclear diction. He repeated the chorus of ''Night and Day'' in French while winking and flirting with his audience. You would have thought he didn't take the lyrics to this sensual love song seriously.</p>
        <p>Despite the lapses Mr. Leerhuber has much potential and a busy roster of future engagements. He will also be a member of the Center for American Artists at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, where he will continue to gain experience. This New York recital was a big step, which is the whole idea of the On Wings of Song series.</p>
