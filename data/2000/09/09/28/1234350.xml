        <p>DaimlerChrysler A.G. said today that its Chrysler car group would report a loss in the third quarter -- the first such loss since a recession in the United States nine years ago -- and that Chrysler's highly respected design chief, Thomas C. Gale, would retire at the end of this year.</p>
        <p>Though neither announcement had been entirely unexpected, they provided new evidence that DaimlerChrysler remains deeply divided between its American and German car companies long after their merger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gale, 57, is the latest in a long series of top Chrysler executives to bail out of the company since the merger two years ago.</p>
        <p>Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler's former president and the top American working on integration of the two companies, quit last year after his relations with German executives soured.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's former chairman, who had been a co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler, retired in March, earlier than expected. Many others below the top ranks have left as well.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler attributed Chrysler's anticipated third-quarter loss to extremely stiff price competition in the United States and the costs of bringing new models to the market quickly.</p>
        <p>But the company insisted that Chrysler would again turn profitable in the last quarter of the year and asserted that total operating profits this year would match those of 1999.</p>
        <p>That would be better than many analysts had been fearing, because rumors have been circulating for weeks that the entire company might report a loss and that full-year profits would decline sharply. Reflecting the relief, shares in DaimlerChrysler rose 2.6 percent in Frankfurt, to 52.8 euros or about $46.62. In New York, shares rose 94 cents, to $45.94.</p>
        <p>That said, the loss at Chrysler is extraordinary given the company's reputation for profitability during the mid-1990's. It is the first such loss since an $82 million shortfall in the third quarter of 1991 -- and that was a recession year, in contrast to the flush economic times in the United States now.</p>
        <p>Investor concern about Chrysler is reflected in the shares of the parent company, which have still lost more than half their value since they peaked at $108 in January 1999. And the basic problems confronting Chrysler are not over. Though the retro-styled PT Cruiser has been a runaway hit, other models are getting stale and need to be revamped.</p>
        <p>In a determined effort to hold its market share, Chrysler has torn into its profit margins by spending vast sums on discount programs and other incentives to consumers.</p>
        <p>In outlining its predictions for the rest of the year, DaimlerChrysler said that Chrysler would lose about $530 million in the third quarter of this year but would post an overall profit for the year of about $1.7 billion.</p>
        <p>Jurgen Schrempp, the chairman of DaimlerChrysler, has already announced plans for billions of dollars in cost-cutting moves during this year and next.</p>
        <p>But the company is looking for additional cuts, while also trying to speed up the introduction of new models and expand production of the PT Cruiser.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Chrysler, Mercedes has continued to post healthy gains.  Even though the German market for midprice cars shriveled this year, largely because of a flood of nearly new used cars on the market, Mercedes sales increased slightly in Germany and about 4.5 percent worldwide.</p>
        <p>Even the much-criticized Smart, the snub-nosed two-seat vehicle that was a flop, has bounced back. Its sales jumped 67 percent through August, to 69,500 cars.</p>
        <p>The resignation of Mr. Gale had been widely expected, but it could be an important loss. Having spent 33 years at Chrysler, Mr. Gale oversaw the design of cars ranging from the popular Chrysler Intrepid sedan to the Dodge Viper, an eye-catching muscle car that helped jazz up Dodge's dusty image.</p>
        <p>Rumors about Mr. Gale's departure spread as soon as it became clear that Mr. Stallkamp was on his way out as president. Earlier this year, when asked in an interview about his intention to stay with the company, he carefully avoided making any long-term commitments.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Gale strongly implied he had indeed begun planning his departure about that time.</p>
        <p>''When Jim Holden took his position as president, I agreed to stay on and see the future product plan through, while continuing to build the team to succeed me,'' Mr. Gale said. ''Now that both of those processes are complete and we're in the next phase of development, it's time for me to step back.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gale will be replaced by Richard O. Schaum, who has been in charge of engineering platforms -- the basic chassis and components that are common to many different car models. Trevor M. Creed, who was recently promoted to senior vice president in charge of design, will be responsible for the more visible aspects of exterior and interior styling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gale also said there are no plans to replace him on the 13-member DaimlerChrysler management board. His departure would leave a 12-member board -- 9 from Daimler and 3 from Chrysler.</p>

        <p>Jeep Investment in China</p>
        <p>By The New York Times</p>
        <p>SHANGHAI, Sept. 27 -- DaimlerChrysler will invest $118 million in cash to revive Beijing Jeep, one of the earliest joint ventures in China, which has been making the same modified Jeep for the last 15 years.</p>
        <p>The investment is part of a $226 million revamping plan meant to prepare the joint venture for competition after China enters the World Trade Organization and duties on imported sport utility vehicles fall. DaimlerChrysler plans to produce two new models at the venture in the next three years. China is expected to join the W.T.O. within the next few months.</p>
