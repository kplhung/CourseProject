        <p>A federal prosecutor in the Wen Ho Lee case told a Senate subcommittee today that a defense lawyer's threat to turn a trial into a ''long, slow death march'' that would force the government to reveal highly classified nuclear weapons data made the government more willing to reach a plea agreement.</p>

        <p>A federal prosecutor in the Wen Ho Lee case told a Senate subcommittee today that a defense lawyer's threat to turn a trial into a ''long, slow death march'' that would force the government to reveal highly classified nuclear weapons data made the government more willing to reach a plea agreement.</p>
        <p>But Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said prosecutors should not have been worried by combative remarks.</p>
        <p>''If someone had told me they were going to put me on a long, slow death march, I would have told them, 'Let's start walking,' '' said Mr. Specter, a former prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Under a law known as the Classified Information Procedures Act, or CIPA, defense lawyers are allowed to try to convince a judge that a defendant must divulge secrets to obtain a fair trial.</p>
        <p>''This was a private meeting that we had in late May,'' the prosecutor, Norman C. Bay, the United States attorney in Albuquerque, said of the discussion with an unidentified defense lawyer. ''He said, 'My guy is not going to take any charge in the indictment, and if you don't like that, I'm going to put you on a long, slow death march under CIPA.' ''</p>
        <p>The fear of exposing nuclear secrets at a trial was cited by the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis J. Freeh, as a critical factor that led the government to settle the case. In a plea bargain reached on Sept. 13, Dr. Lee pleaded guilty to a single count of the 59-count indictment against him.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee's lawyers have insisted that they were not threatening the government but were simply insisting on the public airing of evidence that, they said, would exonerate Dr. Lee at a trial.</p>
        <p>Today's Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing was one day after Mr. Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno testified about the Lee case at another Senate hearing, the beginning of what is expected to be a lengthy Congressional review of the investigation and the prosecution.</p>
        <p>The hearings have not settled the complaints about the government's conduct, nor have they silenced specific criticisms of the prosecutors' actions, including their insistence on keeping Dr. Lee behind bars for 278 days before he was released.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has urged Ms. Reno to appoint a special counsel to review the Lee case. The Justice Department and the F.B.I. have opened internal inquiries into the case led by their separate in-house ethics units.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Schumer has said an outside investigation would be preferable as ''the surest route to a creditable and complete analysis of the troubling questions the public legitimately has with the way the Department and the F.B.I. conducted the case.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee's supporters have also expressed support for an independent inquiry. Cecilia Chang, the founder of WenHoLee.org, an online organization ''advocating justice'' for Dr. Lee, said today that Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh, in their testimony on Tuesday, had failed to justify their actions in the case and presented ''tattered reasons to justify this politically motivated witch hunt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter pressed the witnesses on whether the government could have obtained a cooperation agreement with Dr. Lee much earlier. Mr. Specter cited complaints expressed by the judge in the case, James A. Parker, who said that the prosecutors failed to engage in early settlement negotiations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bay said prosecutors had sought Dr. Lee's cooperation. He quoted from an Aug. 4, 1999, letter written by John J. Kelly, the former United States attorney, to Dr. Lee's lawyer, saying, ''I assure you that I have absolutely no desire to prosecute an innocent man.</p>
        <p>''I have used what tools prosecutors have to try to gather all the facts,'' Mr. Kelly said in the letter.  ''Those facts establish your client's guilt. If additional facts that only he can provide would explain his actions and point to his innocence, I would sincerely like to know that before embarking on a course of action that will have a profound impact on many people. Once again, I extend to you the invitation to have your client tell his side of the story.''</p>
        <p>The lawmakers were highly critical of the government's determination to keep Dr. Lee in jail as he awaited trial. He was confined in a county jail in Albuquerque under solitary conditions like those imposed on maximum security prisoners. At times, Dr. Lee was manacled with wrist, waist and ankle chains, and a light was always on in his cell.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno and Mr. Freeh have said they were unaware of the harsh conditions, and today their aides said  neither Dr. Lee nor his lawyers complained during his confinement. In recent days, Dr. Lee's lawyers have criticized the ''egregious pretrial conditions imposed on him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bay provided a letter from Raymond Sisneros, the sheriff of Santa Fe County, N.M., to Samuel Montoya, the county manager, describing a visit Mr. Sisneros made to Dr. Lee's cell in March for the purpose of asking about Dr. Lee's confinement.</p>
        <p>''Other than being incarcerated he had no complaints,'' the March 10 letter said, adding that ''his only request was for additional fruit at the evening meal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bay also said the light in Dr. Lee's cell that remained switched on during the night was not a bright light. ''I'm told that the light was a dull blue light,'' Mr. Bay said, ''kind of like a night light, in Dr. Lee's room and that the jail would use that just to make sure that if someone walked by and looked inside his cell that they could make sure that he was there and that he was doing O.K.''</p>
