        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I take issue with some of the comments made by film and video professionals in ''Sit! Stay! Bark! Cut!'' and ''Capturing Every Moment of That Saturday Soccer Match,'' Sept.  21, about making movies at home.</p>
        <p>As a professional photographer, I know how hard it is to create a good picture. But so many times have I seen images from an amateur with no photographic skills that have left me as emotionally moved as if they were created by a photographic master. And so it could be with home moviemaking. Rather than being critical of these new tools and technologies, I think these film and video professionals should be watching out for themselves and the work that they do. Similar things were said when desktop publishing was first introduced. Look where that revolution has taken us.</p>
        <p>When I made my iMovie debut (two minutes at most) to my friends and family, it was saluted with a standing ovation (from five people, no less). Nobody commented that it wasn't ''broadcast quality'' or that it ''didn't have enough color saturation.'' What I was able to do is share some video memories with the people I love and not bore them to tears in the process.</p>
