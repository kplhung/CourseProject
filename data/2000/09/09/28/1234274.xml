        <p>A deeply satisfying new musical, with much on its mind about history, humanity, man and God and the American Dream, is beckoning to theatergoers with a taste for rich characters in a tale that touches the heart, glows with humor and soothes the ear.</p>
        <p>Its title is ''The Immigrant,'' and with its splendid cast of four and its sensitive direction by Randal Myler (a Tony Award nominee for ''It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues''), this show marks an auspicious beginning for  CAP21, a nonprofit artistic project development company, at its theater at 15 West 28th Street.</p>
        <p>''The Immigrant'' is at once a tale of the bereavement and beauty of immigration, of a struggle for personal survival paralleled by the struggle to maintain religious tradition in a land of assimilation, and of a long, initially unlikely friendship colored by love and conflict in a world where bigotry, pogroms and genocide know no borders. Most of all, it is a story of faith and hope.</p>
        <p>With a book by Mark Harelik, based on his widely produced play of the same title, ''The Immigrant'' revisits the life of his grandfather, Haskell Harelik, a young Jew who fled the pogroms of old Russia and reached the United States in 1909 as part of a little-known chapter in the story of migration from the Old World to the New.</p>
        <p>Haskell Harelik did not arrive as one of the hordes who passed through the terrifying examinations at Ellis Island and became part of the teeming masses of Manhattan's Lower East Side.</p>
        <p>Instead he was part of the Galveston Movement, conceived and financed by the philanthropist Jacob Henry Schiff, which routed 10,000 Eastern European Jews from Bremen, Germany, through Galveston, Tex., and into the labor-needy industrialized West between 1907 and 1914.</p>
        <p>So, at the outset of ''The Immigrant,'' Haskell Harelik, parched and near collapse, is wheeling his heavy barrow of bananas (a penny each) through his new hometown, Hamilton, Tex., population 1,203, not yet counting Haskell, its only Jew.</p>
        <p>As pivotal moments in life go, Haskell (played by Evan Pappas) has the good fortune to be overcome outside the home of Milton Perry (Walter Charles), the local banker, and his wife, Ima (Cass Morgan).</p>
        <p>Milton is not exactly overjoyed to encounter the dirt-streaked Haskell, who is still more at home in Yiddish than English. But as Milton's churchgoing, crucifix-wearing Baptist wife, Ima (Cass Morgan), counsels him, ''Now behave like a Christian.''</p>
        <p>Before long Haskell not only has some water and a clean face but also a room in the Perry home, for which he proffers a dollar from the sock where he also keeps his papers. Milton refuses. ''Ten,'' he thunders. Haskell is astonished until Milton makes clear that he means 10 cents.</p>
        <p>And so as the years from 1909 to 1942 pass, the lives of the Hareliks and the Perrys intertwine. Milton, as banker, adviser and friend, fosters the growth of Haskell's business, from pushcart to vegetable store to dry goods establishment to department store. Haskell saves enough money to bring over his wife, Leah (Jacqueline Antaramian), who is racked by loneliness and fears the loss of her Jewish traditions. Ima wishes Milton would be baptized. As Haskell prospers, Leah bears him three sons, the arrival of each marked by the planting of a tree.</p>
        <p>And as World War II looms ever nearer, the long relationship between Haskell and Milton reaches a crisis over a Sabbath dinner.</p>
        <p>The pleasure of the show's music, with Sarah Knapp as lyricist and Steven M. Alper as composer, is that it is always at the service of its strong characters, as are the costumes by C. David Russell, the lighting of Jane Cox, the hair and makeup designs of Mitch Ely, the scenery by Beowulf Boritt and the musical direction of Albert Ahronheim. Among the songs, ''The Stars,'' which opens the evening, well merits its three reprises.</p>
        <p>And the four principals do themselves, their collaborators and the generations of Hareliks proud.</p>
