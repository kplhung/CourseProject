        <p>ZEN is an upfront influence at the office of ZoZa, a new fashion company set for its Web debut in mid-October. Shoes are to be removed at the entrance and placed in cabinets. A hefty Chinese gong stands ready to call meetings, and there's a large empty swath of carpet for the staff's morning yoga classes.</p>
        <p>ZoZa's high-tech stretchy clothes feature a symbol from the I Ching that means both ''contemplation'' and ''mountain.'' Floating across the screen at www.zoza.com will be a mini-swirl of snowflakes; click on it for a kernel of Zen wisdom, like, ''Be present, not tense.''</p>
        <p>Mel Ziegler calls these aphorisms ''mind crackers.'' He and his wife, Patricia, as ZoZa's co-founders, have even signed on a genuine Zen master as consultant: Norman Fischer, retired abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center, the largest of its kind in America. ''I have absolutely nothing to offer ZoZa,'' Mr. Fischer said, ''which is what the Zieglers really love!''</p>
        <p>Zen minimalism is a far cry from the amusing, flashy icons of Banana Republic, the Zieglers' first business, with its full-size, in-store giraffes and jungle jeeps poking through the display windows. The couple began a retailing revolution 22 years ago a few miles away in Mill Valley, with safari-style clothing stylishly tweaked by Mrs. Ziegler, a former San Francisco Chronicle illustrator, and promoted by a nifty catalog written by her husband, an ex-Chronicle reporter. Hearing their name for the business, a friend advised: ''Bad choice. You'll be picketed by people from small hot countries.''</p>
        <p>No protesters picketed that first outpost in 1978, or at any of the thundering herd of stores to come, jet-assisted by the wildly popular movie ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' When the Zieglers abruptly resigned in 1988, selling their interest in Banana Republic, by then a unit of Gap Inc., it had 110 stores and was ringing up annual sales of a quarter billion dollars. But customers tired of the Indiana Jones look. Relations between the Zieglers and the Gap's founder, Don Fisher, soured when the couple insisted on publishing a travel magazine and began selling travel books in their shops. (Mr. Fisher reportedly said that if he'd wanted to sell books, he'd have bought Rand McNally.)</p>
        <p>''The real problem,'' Mr. Ziegler said, ''was that Patricia and I were fundamentally unemployable.''</p>
        <p>Now in their 50's, the Zieglers are hitched to a speedy urban rhythm with an accent on easy movement required by his dirt biking and her daily yoga routine, which includes bends that even a tree boa might envy. They're not averse to a touch of functional elegance and even sophistication. The endless safari days are past.</p>
        <p>The Zieglers came away from the Gap divorce feeling tattered by their far-from-smooth ride to moguldom. They retreated to the foothills of Mount Tamalpais above Mill Valley, to a shingled house, circa 1929, they have renovated -- doubling its interior space and adding an aerie that is now a workout room. The project cost $2 million; today the house is worth an estimated $5 million.</p>
        <p>''We'd first driven up to the place at night,'' Mrs. Ziegler recalled. ''It reminded us of the Ahwannee Lodge in Yosemite National Park, where we loved to stay. But the main thing is the way the house was cradled by the mountain. We were pretty intimate with the hiking trails up there. You could reach them directly out the back door of this house without stepping on the street.''</p>
        <p>Those trails were the Zieglers' first priority. A distant second was the unobstructed view of San Francisco, 10 miles off. Often fogged in by morning, the city scintillates like a distant jewel box by night from the south-facing windows.</p>
        <p>Those ample windows, with their original steel frames, had also caught Mrs. Ziegler's offbeat eye. ''They reminded me of windows in artists' lofts in old industrial buildings,'' she explained. (In the renovation, she looked far and wide to locate a firm that still fabricated steel windows.)  She oversaw much of the redesign, from the minimalist redwood baseboards (she thought stock ones were ''too fancy'') to the new cedar shingles on the facade. The Zieglers elected to use a labor-intensive, technique, a throwback to the Arts and Crafts movement: hand-dipping each shingle in an oil-based stain and then letting it air dry. The result, worthy of Greene &amp; Greene, is shingles that will shrink evenly as they age.</p>
        <p>The couple have filled the house with Mrs. Ziegler's paintings and with folk art -- snakes and other reptiles preferred. Once, while climbing in the Peruvian Andes, Mrs. Ziegler was suddenly enveloped by a giant shadow. Looking up, she saw a gliding adult condor, its wingspan easily twice her own length. Back home, she sketched a condor's head and had it carved into the living room's redwood beams. Wild creatures also abound in Mrs. Ziegler's paintings. A tiny watercolor on a stairway wall shows elephants dimly seen in a nocturnal march, their tusks reflecting moonlight.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of Banana Republic, the Zieglers assumed they'd be full-time homebodies and parents to Zio, now 12, and Aza, 8. Even when Revlon came calling, asking the couple to start a new line of natural cosmetics, they stayed put. When Aza' s third grade teacher asked the class to describe what their parents did, she reported that her mother painted and ''my daddy rides his dirt bike in the mountains.''</p>
        <p>They studied Zen in the quiet time after Banana Republic, and traded in their espresso machine for a teapot. ''We were attempting to live our lives by sips instead of slurps,'' Mr. Ziegler said. Fine tea was harder to find locally than fine coffee. So, with a young business partner, the Zieglers created a new company in 1991, naming it the Republic of Tea. The labels for the company's metal tea canisters, handsome and practical, were painted by Mrs. Ziegler while she was confined to bed during her second pregnancy. They still incorporate the squat, black family teapot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ziegler named the teas and wrote the canister copy as beguilingly as he had written Banana Republic's catalog. (In 1999, the trade magazine Catalog World named Banana Republic's catalog the best ever.)</p>
        <p>In 1994, the company was sold to a Midwestern beverage bottler. The Zieglers, who'd gotten this company up and running without ever leaving home, celebrated the sale by buying the house next door and converting it into a painting studio, play area and meditation center.</p>
        <p>The couple had no intention of starting a third business. But then, last summer, they got a phone call from Edward Strobin, their old chief operating officer at Banana Republic -- and a loyalist in their struggle with the Gap. ''Everyone else is making a bundle with Internet start-ups,'' Mr. Strobin said. ''Why should we be left out?''</p>
        <p>Last February, infused with $12 million by Softbank, the Japanese venture capital giant, in return for a 20-percent stake in the company, ZoZa was born. The Zieglers, who are majority shareholders, say they ''seeded'' the company, but refuse to disclose their investment. The couple insist they would never have committed to a new business without Mr. Strobin to handle daily operations. But they lost him in July to a swiftly attacking cancer. ''It was too late to put on the brakes,'' Mr. Ziegler said. ''We had 40 people working for us.''</p>
        <p>ZoZa is a word that, like the names of the couple's children, is a pure Zieglerism. Like  Banana Republic, the company is spun out of the couple's lifestyle of the moment.</p>
        <p>The clothing -- 56 pieces in all -- is entirely made from the newest hi-tech performance fabrics from Japan and Italy. Everyone knows the mantra -- these are the fabrics that wick away sweat, breathe, stretch with the body -- and the Zieglers are hardly unique in upthinking them. But they found most true tech clothing too big, too shapeless or too tight for spiffy segues from office to see-and-be-seen bistro.</p>
        <p>ZoZa's declared mission is to bring maximum refinement of cut, style and finish to a washable ready-to-wear line: ''Patagonia crossed with Prada,'' is how one hopeful ZoZa marketing executive puts it. Well, not quite. But there is a floor-length evening gown with an oval cutout in back and a mermaid-like sweep back from the feet. Seams wander with the wearer's curves, which are cradled in built-in underwear. Made from Lycra swimsuit fabric, it comes bundled in a small mesh sack. Stuff it into the glove compartment in the morning on the way to work and pull it out, unwrinkled, to slip on just before party time. If you get tossed in the pool, just start swimming. The gown can even be washed in its sack.</p>
        <p>ZoZa seams attempt to go where the body goes -- especially in enticing places like the small of the back. ''Patricia puts seams where they have never gone before, but where they always should have been,'' said Gale Parker, ZoZa's design director, formerly head designer for Ralph Lauren.</p>
        <p>The original plan to sell ZoZa only as Web wear has been scrapped. The first ZoZa ''walk-in Web site''is planned for later this year in Mill Valley. Customers will be able to try on the clothes, then order from in-store computers. An old-fashioned paper catalog, sized like a CD case, is also pending, and there has been interest from two retail giants to form a strategic alliance.</p>
        <p>Daniele Clutier, director of fashion research at the Institut Francais de la Mode, in Paris, viewed the ZoZa Web site. ''Like Banana Republic, ZoZa seems to promise fashion with a soul and a strong personality,'' Ms. Clutier said. ''Postmodernist theory tells us that we humans need meaningfulness, which we try to derive partly from consumer objects, especially clothes. So it seems good for ZoZa to have something to say beyond 'We're nice and fashionable.' ''</p>
        <p>This is a tense time for the Zieglers, with Patricia getting out the clothes and Mel working on the next round of financing. The pair preserve their calm with a 30-minute commute to their new ''Zen house,'' situated on a bluff over the Pacific Ocean at Stinson Beach. ''You won't see the house,'' Mr. Ziegler warned. ''It's behind a redwood fence with a hidden gate.''</p>
        <p>After the elaborate, art-filled Mill Valley manse, the Zen house, marked by a single Japanese lantern, comes as a bit of a shock. It's a small place, sparsely furnished, with a garage that has been converted to an art studio. But all artwork has been banished. Mrs. Ziegler motioned to the big windows with their sweeping vistas of the ocean and muscular hills where evergreen trees alternate with straw-colored meadows. ''Those are our paintings,'' Mrs. Ziegler said.</p>
        <p>The Zieglers insist that, if not for its relative isolation, they'd prefer to live now full time in the ''squalor'' of the Zen house rather than in the grander Mill Valley home. ''The difference in the two homes is like the difference between Banana Republic and ZoZa,'' Mrs. Ziegler explained. ''The Mill Valley is about romance. It's hard to maintain. The Zen house is simple and really functional, like ZoZa clothes.''</p>
        <p>On a bright late summer day, the Zieglers prepared to head to San Francisco. Zio, Aza and a friend had already piled into the rear of the family station wagon. Mr. Ziegler said, ''It's fun to be working for ourselves again after years of working for them.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ziegler pointed to a large black duffel bag stuffed with samples of ZoZa wear. ''Sometimes, something just coagulates in midair,'' she said, ''and people say: 'That's it! That's the spirit of the age!' ''</p>
        <p>The cybercurtain is about to go up on ZoZa. Clicking rather than clapping will determine whether, once again, the Zieglers can transmute the spirit of this high-tech age into clothes.</p>
