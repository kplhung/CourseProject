        <p>THOMAS LIPSMEYER, a high-school senior with a talent for the tenor sax, plays in every instrumental ensemble in his school and practices nearly five hours a day. So when he decided that he wanted to go to a college with a strong music program, he applied the same discipline to the college-search process.</p>
        <p>He logged on to the Internet, searched online databases for colleges with music majors and came up with 30 that seemed to match his criteria. He visited the colleges' Web sites, scanning for photos or news stories that would show devotion to the subject he loved. He pored over online statistics of placement rates, data that told him how often a college's graduates find jobs.</p>
        <p>After months of research, he narrowed his choices to three, including two colleges he had never heard of when he started.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I could have done it without the Web,'' said Mr. Lipsmeyer, who attends Parkersburg South High School in West Virginia. ''I probably would have selected West Virginia University and just gone there. I wouldn't have heard anything about other colleges because they were out of state.''</p>
        <p>But not everything about the process worked to his liking. As he did his online research, some sites asked him to fill out registration forms and disclose his e-mail and home addresses.</p>
        <p>''Ever since I did that,'' he said, sounding annoyed, ''I've been getting an awful lot of mail about opportunities to join the Army, Navy and Air Force.'' Was this something he was interested in? ''No,'' he said without hesitation.</p>
        <p>College-bound students across the country, and in some cases around the world, are experiencing the same mix of euphoria and frustration. Many rave about how the Web is making the search for a college easier than ever. Using online software, students looking for a college can highlight preferences like location, cost or size on an online questionnaire and instantaneously receive lists of colleges tailored to their criteria. Of the several Web sites that offer search software -- including Embark.com, Collegeboard.com and CollegeQuest.com -- many even enable students to conduct side-by-side comparisons of college data, store that information in personalized online lockers and click on a few buttons to send e-mail requests to the colleges of their choice.</p>
        <p>On their Web sites, colleges often provide an in-depth look at academic departments and student clubs. Many offer e-mail chats with professors and students. College newspapers maintain their own Web sites with archives of stories about life on campus. Articles, rankings and virtual tours abound -- and all are free.</p>
        <p>No longer do students have to sit in a library flipping through college guidebooks (most of which are usually in the reference section, where they cannot be checked out). No longer are they dependent on their parents and guidance counselors to point them to a particular university.</p>
        <p>''The power has shifted to the student when it comes to research,'' said Phil Dunkelberger, chief executive and president of Embark.com.</p>
        <p>But in coursing through the online terrain, students are also finding its pitfalls. In many cases, the Web sites are free because they are supported by advertising and e-commerce partners, companies that provide commissions to Web sites that help them sell products to students.</p>
        <p>And if free Web sites do not display much advertising, they make money another way: They collect contact information by using registration forms and then sell the students' addresses to colleges and sometimes to commercial entities like banks, long-distance companies and textbook shops.</p>
        <p>In most cases, the registration forms allow students to opt out of such marketing instead of allowing them to request only the material they are interested in. To avoid unsolicited marketing messages, a student must erase a check mark next to a statement like ''Yes. Please pass my name to companies that can provide me with information that can help.'' In many cases, students will not even realize that by leaving those boxes checked, they may be opening the floodgates of print or e-mail advertising.</p>
        <p>CollegeQuest.com, a site run by Peterson's, a large educational publishing company, says it may disclose a student's contact information to ''carefully selected partners'' unless the student says otherwise. CollegeLink.com, a site that offers search services and electronic college applications, does the same. (Offline, the same ''opt out'' marketing technique is used by the College Board; anyone who registers for the SAT is also signing up to receive marketing materials from colleges. Officials at the College Board stress, however, that they do not give or sell those students' names to commercial enterprises.)</p>
        <p>With the Web's outpouring of college information comes another problem: the outpouring of college information. Unless students search for colleges using very specific criteria, for example, online software programs will list hundreds of matches. Several guidance counselors have said that they are finding themselves in more demand, not less, as students and parents troop into their offices asking about colleges they had never heard of before they saw them online.</p>
        <p>Just as the Web has made medical patients both more informed and more confused about health-care options, some high-school guidance counselors say it has done the same for students and parents who are shopping for a college.</p>
        <p>''I'll talk to parents who start by saying, 'Well, I've been researching this on the Internet,' '' said Diane Bower, Mr. Lipsmeyer's guidance counselor. ''They are much more knowledgeable,'' she said, but they are still looking for advice.</p>
        <p>In fact, Cris Maloney, senior vice president for marketing at Peterson's, is not convinced that the surge in Web-based information has yet made a difference in helping students.</p>
        <p>''The tools have changed but the process hasn't changed,'' he said. Until the data becomes more meaningful, he said, too many students will discover after arriving on campus that they would rather be somewhere else. Simply learning that a college enrolls, say, 15,000 students, offers a botany major and features a low teacher-to-student ratio, he said, is not enough.</p>
        <p>Next month, he said, Peterson's will provide online access to a new set of data. The service, called Best College Picks, is based on research from the Institute for Research on Higher Education, which has surveyed nearly 40,000 people about their jobs, their values and how they spend their time. The new service will ask students what kind of people they want to be and will then retrieve names of colleges that have already turned out graduates that match those types.</p>
        <p>''It will, I hope, make the student a more informed shopper,'' said Robert Zemsky, director of the institute and leader of the research project, which was financed by the federal Education Department and other organizations. ''The smarter the shopper, the better the product range.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, colleges are trying to offer students as many online opportunities as possible to dig beyond statistics and glossy photographs. California Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo, for example, has sent prospective students who indicated an interest in agriculture e-mail invitations to an annual preview day for the college of agriculture in late October.</p>
        <p>Even the in-depth information offered on the college Web sites is making a difference. Leah Welsh, a freshman at Earlham College, a small liberal-arts college in Indiana, said that last year she visited Earlham's Web site to look at the syllabuses of courses she might be interested in. And Mr. Lipsmeyer, the musician at Parkersburg South High School, said he had gained an appreciation for Michigan State University after reading the university's online articles about its music department.</p>
        <p>For students too far away to visit a college, online resources are a critical lifeline. Jing Chen, a first-year graduate student at Rutgers University, lived in China before arriving in the United States last month. She found Rutgers by searching the annual rankings posted on the Web site of U.S. News &amp; World Report and looking for universities with a large proportion of international students. She clicked to the Rutgers site and sent off an e-mail message to its admissions office.</p>
        <p>''If there was no Web,'' she said, ''how would I have found them and gotten in touch?'' Before the Internet, she said, Chinese students would search through photocopies of outdated American guidebooks and send letters to some colleges, but the process was expensive and it took weeks, if not months, to get a reply.</p>
        <p>Parents can take heart, however, in knowing that while the Internet may be the chosen medium for research on colleges, Mom and Dad still have an impact on students' decisions about which colleges to attend. A recent survey called StudentPoll, which queried more than 400 college-bound students, showed that information from parents, current students and college admissions staff exerted more influence than Web sites over college choice. And nearly 70 percent of respondents said that actually stepping foot on campus was most important.</p>
        <p>''Looking at the Web is a good way to get a basic feel for the college,'' said Ms. Welsh, who decided to enroll at Earlham after spending a day touring its small campus and noticing the diversity of students there. ''But you have to go visit it to really decide.''</p>
        <p>Site-Seeing: College Searches  Finding That Special Someplace</p>
        <p>For students who are starting their college searches, several Web sites offer one-stop shops that include searchable databases of college information, test preparation aids, virtual tours and online applications. Here are some of the leading sites and some of the additional features they contain:</p>
        <p>THE COLLEGE BOARD: www.collegeboard.com -- Features online registration for the SAT and help with essay preparation. Plans to offer soon a search feature called LikeFinder, which will enable students to find colleges similar to the ones they are reading about, and a feature that will generate side-by-side comparisons of selected colleges.</p>
