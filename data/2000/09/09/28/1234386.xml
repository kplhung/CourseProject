        <p>Are you getting the feeling, as I am, that we are being jerked around by wildly swinging poll numbers?</p>
        <p>Pre-conventions, George W. Bush led by 17 points; post-conventions, Al Gore took the lead. Last week most major polls had Gore breezing to victory; this week, it's Bush edging him out.</p>
        <p>With every swing of the poll pendulum, media coverage changes to savage the front-runner. Similarly, whoever is in ''free fall'' can do nothing right -- until a ''surge'' by the formerly collapsing campaign restores smugness at headquarters.</p>
        <p>Is the American majority really switching every few days? Did Gore's Kiss change tens of millions of minds? This week The Washington Times headlined ''Bush Surges Ahead of Gore After Chats With Oprah and Regis.'' Was a 13-point lead in the previous, wacky, Newsweek poll really all but erased by a Bush counter smooch on Oprah's cheek?</p>
        <p>No. The reasons for the unprecedented swings, and for the reporting that further exaggerates the swings, are (1) the pressured pollution of the public opinion polls, and (2) the horse-race media's hyping of polls as predictors of voting behavior.</p>
        <p>Have you noticed, in all the breathless reports of poll results as if they were reflections of coming reality, the disappearance of a category that used to be called ''the undecideds''?  If one of the candidates is reported leading by 44 percent to 42, that means 14 percent are determinedly undecided or pulling for splinter parties. And that is after ''pushing.''</p>
        <p>Because client news organizations in hot competition demand a hard answer to ''who's winning?'' the pressure is on pollsters not to take ''I dunno'' for an answer. The pollster pushes: ''Which candidate do you lean toward today?''</p>
        <p>If the interviewee had just been  impressed by a powderpuff TV interview, he or she will reluctantly ''lean'' toward whoever seems hotter on the Internet or in cable talk or whose name is more familiar. The poll then counts that person as taking a side. Next day, the same type of person's soft leaning could easily switch and would appear as a change of mind. It is not; what is reported as a ''surge'' is merely a sample of wavering out loud.</p>
        <p>Another reason for the seeming voter volatility is the social unacceptability of appearing uninformed. Many people who are unwilling to commit before the debates toss out a name to avoid appearing apathetic or unpatriotic.</p>
        <p>Sometimes pollsters will assuage their media clients' demands for results by means of allocation. If one candidate is ahead in a poll by 45 percent to 40, and 15 percent haven't made up their minds, a poll may allocate the uncommitted on the ratio of decided respondents, thereby exaggerating the front-runner's lead.</p>
        <p>The word ''respondent'' sends shudders through the nose-counting community. The dirty secret of political surveys is this: As recently as 1984, the response rate to pollsters' questioning was 65 percent; that is, two out of three people reached would answer. Pollster friends whisper to me that the response rate is now down to 35 percent. (Two out of three pollsters I called went mum or hung up on me, thus validating this reported figure in my mind, which never leaves margin for error.)</p>
        <p>What does this remarkable response refusal tell us? It means that two out of three Americans are  guarding their privacy with answering machines or Caller ID, or are telling pollsters to ''stop bothering me at dinnertime.'' Also, because we suspect that a response puts our private opinions on a telemarketer's data base, we are now much less likely to cooperate with pollsters.</p>
        <p>The one-third of potential interviewees who do respond are either the aforementioned pushables or people eager to make their views known: partisans, activists and the committed. Together, these are not representative of all likely voters and ignore the widespread indecision.</p>
        <p>All major polls in the 1996 election underestimated support for Bob Dole, the New York Times/CBS poll by 7 percent, affecting media coverage and voter turnout. Only the maverick, Zogby/Reuter, came in on the money.</p>
        <p>So I called John Zogby and laid on him my irate view of the abuse of  polling. He in turn gave me this insight: ''Since 1998, we have evidence that voters are more likely to reject the views of all pundits.'' Why do I need to know that? ''If you want to help Bush -- attack him.''</p>
