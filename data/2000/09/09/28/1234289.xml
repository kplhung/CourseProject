        <p>Ever since Shakespeare wrote his play about them, Romeo and Juliet have gone through innumerable artistic reincarnations. Their tragedy has inspired many ballets, operas and movies and, as Leonard Bernstein's classic musical ''West Side Story'' and Baz Luhrmann's 1996  film adaptation demonstrate, the people who portray these lovers can look as believable in modern dress as they do in Renaissance attire.</p>
        <p>Romeo and Juliet are choreographically reborn on inner-city streets in ''Rome &amp; Jewels,'' which Rennie Harris Puremovement, a Philadelphia-based company, brought to the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night. As the title indicates, the lovers' names have been changed, and the feuding Montagues and Capulets are now two rival street gangs, the Monster Q's and the Caps. Mr. Harris has based his choreography for them on contemporary hip-hop dance styles.</p>

        <p>Ever since Shakespeare wrote his play about them, Romeo and Juliet have gone through innumerable artistic reincarnations. Their tragedy has inspired many ballets, operas and movies and, as Leonard Bernstein's classic musical ''West Side Story'' and Baz Luhrmann's 1996  film adaptation demonstrate, the people who portray these lovers can look as believable in modern dress as they do in Renaissance attire.</p>
        <p>Romeo and Juliet are choreographically reborn on inner-city streets in ''Rome &amp; Jewels,'' which Rennie Harris Puremovement, a Philadelphia-based company, brought to the Joyce Theater on Tuesday night. As the title indicates, the lovers' names have been changed, and the feuding Montagues and Capulets are now two rival street gangs, the Monster Q's and the Caps. Mr. Harris has based his choreography for them on contemporary hip-hop dance styles.</p>
        <p>The accompaniment is provided by Ozzie Jones, the evening's narrator, and assisting musicians known as DJ Miz, DJ Cisum and DJ Evil Tracy. Together they offer a mixture of recordings and original music by Darrin Ross. The production also includes speeches combining Shakespearean quotations with rap monologues. The setting incorporates video images of street scenes as well as views of the dancers themselves in motion.</p>
        <p>The theatrical results are sometimes striking, sometimes puzzling. What provides the production with its impact is the movement: the sudden transitions from slouchiness to stiffness, the apparently inexhaustible variety of shakes and tremblings, the twitches suggesting that the dancers have just been struck by lightning. People swivel on the floor and balance on their heads and shoulders. The way they punch at the air itself, as well as at the enemies of the characters they portray, is a sign that nothing is to be trusted in the troubled urban world of ''Rome &amp;  Jewels.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Harris expertly uses hip-hop movement to establish emotional atmosphere, he is less successful in applying it to tell his story and to establish his characters' personalities. The hip-hop sequences, though genuinely tumultuous, do not always propel the narrative. At one point a character declares, ''All motion ain't progress.'' That remark could also serve as a comment on the production's dramatic problems.</p>
        <p>Although Rodney Mason, as Rome,  looks sensitive as well as tough, other characters are less individualized. Mr. Harris's most daring creative decision is to make this a ''Romeo and Juliet'' without a visible Juliet. The characters talk about Jewels, yet she never actually appears. This tragedy involving young love and city streets is presented entirely from a male point of view. But the absence of a real woman for Rome to court makes it difficult to judge the intensity of his love.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the sheer energy of Mr. Harris's choreography is remarkable and, given the urban setting, somewhat frightening. ''Rome and Jewels'' may not be totally convincing dramatically, but it is always exciting kinetically. It continues through Sunday at the Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea.</p>
