        <p>Sally Ride, the first woman who was an American astronaut, resigned on Tuesday as president of Space.com, a year after she joined the company, a Manhattan multimedia publishing firm that bundles space-related Web sites and services.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ride, a physics professor on leave from the University of California, San Diego, said she was looking to spend more time involved in science education. ''It has been an exciting 15 months, with an exciting company,'' Ms. Ride said in a statement. But she added that she now has ''a chance to put my energies in an area that's fundamentally important to me.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ride succeeded Rich Zahradnik, who in 1999 left CNN with the cable news network's business editor, Lou Dobbs, to found Space.com. Mr. Zahradnik resigned after only two months in the position.</p>
        <p>Space.com has made several purchases since Ms. Ride took the helm last year, including a space news and education Web site in November 1999 and a space-related software company. In a joint effort with Hearst Magazines, it began publishing a print magazine called Space.com Illustrated this month.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ride flew in two space shuttle missions for NASA and later ran NASA's Office of Strategic Planning and its Office of Exploration.</p>
