        <p>The Gore-Lieberman campaign is raising millions of dollars for an obscure fund that is supposed to pay only for legal and accounting costs and not television advertisements or other political costs.</p>
        <p>But recent solicitation letters for the fund suggest that a donation to it will help the Gore-Lieberman campaign attack the Republicans, leading some campaign finance experts and Bush aides to say the messages are misleading and run afoul of federal election law.</p>
        <p>In a pair of letters sent to supporters, including one sent this week, Mr. Gore says that contributions of $1,000 or less to the fund will be used to ''expose the Bush-Cheney voting record.''</p>
        <p>''The Republicans are working hard to cloud their record and their real views,'' Mr. Gore writes in one message. ''The campaign urgently needs your support to expose their real agenda.''</p>
        <p>Despite such suggestions that the contributions will help pay for attacks on the Republicans, the Federal Election Commission prohibits money given to that committee to pay for anything other than campaign lawyers and accountants.</p>
        <p>Aides to Gov. George W. Bush accused the vice president's campaign today of using the fund-raising solicitation messages to ''mislead contributors'' about how the money would be spent and ''attempting to skirt federal campaign spending limits.''</p>
        <p>''The vice president, after his protestations that he would be the messenger for campaign finance reform, has found a shady way to circumvent federal election spending limits, an apparent violation of F.E.C. regulations,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. ''These are deceptive fund-raising solicitations.''</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said the solicitations were not deceptive and were entirely legal. He stressed that a computerized link in the messages, which were sent by e-mail, leads the reader directly to another computerized page that allows the use of a credit-card to make a donation of up to $1,000.</p>
        <p>On that page, a disclaimer required by the F.E.C. appears, stating the contributions to the General Election Legal and Accounting Compliance Fund, also known as Gelac (pronounced GEE-lak), will be used to pay the Gore-Lieberman campaign's lawyers and accountants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fabiani added that contributors cannot make a donation without being led to the page that clearly states the donations will pay the fees of lawyers and accountants.</p>
        <p>''The e-mail goes to the link and the link very clearly sets out the F.E.C. language,'' Mr. Fabiani said.</p>
        <p>But some experts on federal election law were troubled that the message strongly implies that the money will help the Gore-Lieberman ticket pay for issue advertisements.</p>
        <p>''I'm troubled by the language, because it is so clearly an end run around the purposes of the F.E.C. regulation,'' said Trevor Potter, a former F.E.C. chairman who was a lawyer with Senator John McCain's campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's presidential exploratory committee began raising money for the Gelac in January 1999. The committee has already taken in more than $7 million and spent $547,700 on fund-raising consultants and direct-mail costs, F.E.C. records show. Mr. Fabiani said all of that money was spent on Gelac solicitations, which federal election guidelines permit.</p>
        <p>For his Gelac, Mr. Bush has raised $4.3 million and spent $68,193 on fund-raising costs.</p>
        <p>Last month and earlier this month, the Gore-Lieberman campaign sent, by e-mail, at least four letters seeking donations to the committee. A spokesman for the Bush-Cheney campaign said the campaign was considering whether to file a complaint with the F.E.C.</p>
        <p>Ian Striton, an F.E.C. spokesman, declined to say if the agency was examining the Gore-Lieberman Gelac solicitations. ''The campaigns are audited after the election to check out what has occurred within the fund,'' Mr. Striton said.</p>
        <p>When the Bush and Gore campaigns in August accepted $67.5 million federal taxpayer dollars to pay for the general election campaigns, the candidates vowed not to raise any more ''hard money,'' the $1,000 checks from individuals. But the Gelac committees can continue to raise donations of $1,000 from individuals to pay for legal and accounting costs, even from contributors who have already given the legal limit of $1,000 to the candidates' primary campaigns.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: FUND-RAISING  Correction:  September 29, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about accusations by the Bush campaign that the Gore campaign sent out misleading solicitation letters for a fund for legal and accounting expenses misspelled the surname of a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, who declined to say whether the agency was examining the solicitations. He is Ian Stirton, not Striton.</p>
