        <p>When a character in the musical ''Phantom of the Opera'' tries to explain away mysterious mishaps by saying ''these things happen,'' another character says emphatically, ''These things do not happen.''</p>
        <p>Steve Phillips acknowledged yesterday that there is a thing that happens to the Mets when they play the Atlanta Braves.</p>
        <p>Without putting the words to music, the Mets' general manager said: ''We have a thing. We've got to try to figure out what it is and why it is and how we're going to overcome it. There's no ignoring that there's a thing. It's silly to say, 'Oh no, it's just baseball.' It's something we have to overcome.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Braves defeated the Mets in the last three games of the season, knocking them out of a chance for the wild-card spot in the playoffs. Last September, the Mets went to Atlanta a mere game behind the Braves and lost all three games there, then lost two of three in New York. Last week's trip to Atlanta resulted in two losses in three games. And then Tuesday night at Shea Stadium the Braves heaped insult upon the Mets' inability to beat them by clinching their ninth consecutive division championship.</p>
        <p>It was as in-your-face as it gets in baseball. ''It's not going to be like this for the next 20 years,'' Phillips said. ''Sooner or later it's going to turn.''</p>
        <p>Trying to turn it one step at a time, the Mets beat the Braves, 6-2, last night and gained the National League playoffs as the wild card for the second successive season.</p>
        <p>Despite a month in which they have won only 11 of the 25 games they have played, the Mets reached the postseason more easily than a year ago. And if they want to embellish baseball's version of a consolation prize, the Mets can congratulate themselves for qualifying for the playoffs sooner than the Yankees.</p>
        <p>But Bobby Cox, the Braves' manager, offered a more significant observation. ''The Mets can take it easy now,'' he said. ''Everyone else is trying to get the best record.''</p>
        <p>The Braves, whom the Mets cannot play in the first round, the Giants and the Cardinals have similar records and will play the remaining four games trying to win home-field advantage (first two games and fifth game of a three-of-five-game series). The Mets will play the Giants or the Cardinals, whichever team finishes with the better record, beginning Wednesday in its park.</p>
        <p>The Mets will have to win that series for a chance to play the Braves, as they did last year, in the league series. Should they meet again, the Mets hope they will have added confidence after clinching their spot against the Braves.</p>
        <p>''We saw again that we can get hits and run the bases aggressively and pitch to their hitters,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''They might have had a letdown tonight after clinching last night. We respect them as a good team. Before it's all over, we're determined to gain their respect.''</p>
        <p>The Mets have been stoic about their fate. And maybe just a bit disingenuous. What's the difference, they proclaimed, if they finished first or finished second and won the wild-card distinction? Either way they would be in the playoffs, and any team in the playoffs can make it to the World Series and win it. They have often cited the 1997 Florida Marlins as their role model.</p>
        <p>After last night's game, the Mets wore caps and posted clubhouse signs proclaiming themselves the wild-card winner. Before the game, Valentine addressed the issue of being the wild-card team, and he sounded downright defensive about it. He chose to compare his team to the Cardinals, who began the evening with 92 victories to the Mets' 89. The Cardinals had already clinched the National League Central title.</p>
        <p>''St. Louis has won one more game in every 50 than we have,'' Valentine said, ''and in their city they're supposed to feel like the kings and in our city people think that we should run away and hide and be embarrassed about entering the playoffs. I don't get it. And neither do my guys, so I tell them I don't get it either.''</p>
        <p>Then, relating a comment one of his players had made to him, the manager added, ''One of my guys said which person is it who they were supposed to go over and apologize to when they made the playoffs. I said I don't get this whole thing. I said let's play the game, win the game and not worry about the nonsense. Even those who make something out of nothing will make nonsense a major story.''</p>
        <p>Valentine, a veteran manager with tenures in Texas and New York, has long been obsessed with the news media. It is important for him to have supporters in that area. He doesn't care for critics. He could avoid some of the attention he gets, but he brings it on himself.</p>
        <p>Last September, as the Mets were struggling to win that wild-card slot, he was interviewed by Sports Illustrated and said he had ''five losers'' among the players in his clubhouse. He also said other managers would be afraid to appear on a panel with him because he would make them look bad.</p>
        <p>A year later, he sat for an interview with New York magazine and even brought up the 1999 article, which caused a ton of angst in the Mets' hierarchy. He didn't utter any similarly inflammatory comments, but he denounced the idea of a magazine publishing such an interview at this time of year with the Mets in such a position. Of course, he could have declined the interview.</p>
        <p>He also referred to ''a couple of clowns'' (a k a reporters) in the New York area. He said they didn't give him the credit he deserved, saying,  ''If I win the World Series, they're going to say I didn't sweep.''</p>
        <p>The Mets took the first step last night toward giving their manager a chance to find out if he is correct.</p>
