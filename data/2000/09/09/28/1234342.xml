        <p>With eight Hollywood executives appearing as witnesses before a Senate committee, politicians from both parties today stepped up their criticism of the way violent movies are marketed to children.</p>
        <p>Referring to a new industry policy announced on Tuesday to limit that kind of marketing, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said, ''My friends, that language is not good enough.''</p>
        <p>The policy, which was introduced by the Motion Picture Association of America, the industry's trade group, requires film studios to set a ''goal of not inappropriately specifically targeting children'' in advertising and promoting R-rated films.</p>
        <p>Under the industry's voluntary code, children younger than 17 are not supposed to be admitted to movies rated R unless they are accompanied by an adult.</p>
        <p>''I don't understand this language,'' said Senator McCain, chairman of the commerce committee. ''I think it's filled with loopholes.''</p>
        <p>On the campaign trail, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, said the language of the movie industry's policy ''almost suggests that one could appropriately specifically target children in their advertising of R-rated films, and that's wrong.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference on Capitol Hill, Lynne Cheney, whose husband, Dick, is the Republican nominee for vice president, accused the Democrats of talking out of both sides of their mouths -- criticizing Hollywood ''with a wink and a nudge'' and then soliciting money from the entertainment industry.</p>
        <p>The eight executives at the commerce committee hearing were asked whether they would promise not to market R-rated films directly to children younger than 17.</p>
        <p>Four said they would, and four said they would not, insisting that some R-rated movies were appropriate for teenagers younger than 17 who attended the films with their parents.</p>
        <p>One of those not taking the pledge, Mel Harris, president and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said it was a ''judgment lapse'' for his company to try to advertise a film with violent scenes on a children's television network.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris defended Columbia Pictures, a subsidiary of Sony, in another instance when children ages 9 to 11 were interviewed as part of the test marketing of a violent R-rated movie. But Mr. Harris said the studio would stop using under-age children in focus groups unless they were accompanied by their parents.</p>
        <p>The Senate hearing was called in response to the Federal Trade Commission report released on Sept. 11 that the vast majority of adult-rated movies, recordings and electronic games were marketed to children.</p>
        <p>At the conclusion of the morning-long hearing, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, told the executives: ''You've really got to help us out. Parents are really struggling out there. You are part of the solution and part of the problem.''</p>
        <p>It was left to the studios whom to send to testify today, and those who did were not the companies' highest-ranking executives. For instance, Robert Iger, president of the Walt Disney Company, testified instead of its more prominent chairman, Michael D. Eisner, and Mr. Harris testified for Sony Pictures instead of the chairman, John Calley.</p>
        <p>Without being asked, Mr. Harris gave an explanation of two instances cited in a front-page article in The New York Times today in which films with violence made by Columbia were marketed to young children.</p>
        <p>In one case, the studio tried to advertise ''The Fifth Element,'' a science-fiction thriller starring Bruce Willis, on Nickelodeon, a cable network with an audience mostly 12 years old or younger. The network refused to accept the advertisements.</p>
        <p>''Our advertisement buyers went astray,'' Mr. Harris said. ''That was a judgment lapse.''</p>
        <p>In the other case, researchers hired by the company interviewed 50 children, ages 9 to 11, to evaluate concepts for the sequel to ''I Know What You Did Last Summer,'' about a serial slasher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris said the producer had been surprised to learn from the researchers that a large number of young children went to that movie, and he was interested in their views.</p>
        <p>In preparation for the sequel, ''I Still Know What You Did Last Summer,'' researchers called the parents of children who had seen the first movie, asked their permission to speak with the children and then interviewed them on the telephone, Mr. Harris said.</p>
        <p>He said he thought the procedure was acceptable since the parents gave permission, but he promised that children younger than 17 would not be used again in test marketing by his company unless their parents were actually with them.</p>
        <p>Executives from Disney, DreamWorks SKG, the 20th Century Fox Film unit of the News Corporation and the Warner Brothers unit of Time Warner pledged not to appeal directly to children under 17 in advertisements of R-rated films.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Harris, executives from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Viacom's Paramount Pictures unit and Universal Studios refused to take that pledge.</p>
        <p>Stacey Snider, chairwoman of Universal, which is owned by the Seagram Company, said her studio would certainly not ''market R-rated films to 12-year-olds,'' but said many such films were ''suitable for mature teenagers to see with their parents.''</p>
        <p>Chris McGurk, vice chairman and chief operating officer of MGM, said his studio planned to release two R-rated films about World War II next year that ''could be of great value to mature teens.''</p>
        <p>At another hearing on the other side of the Capitol, one reviewing the pending merger between America Online and Time Warner, an awkward moment occurred when a congressman asked Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman, whether he thought the media promoted violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin, whose son, Jonathan, a teacher, was killed in 1997 by a former student, responded that he doubted that the congressman, Steve Largent, Republican of Oklahoma, had actually experienced violence as a personal tragedy.</p>
