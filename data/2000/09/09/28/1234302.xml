        <p>The former Olympic track coach Mel Rosen says there is only one good place to run a long sprint from  Lane 1: the moon.</p>
        <p>Earthbound athletes have to contend with tight curves and centrifugal force and staggered starts. It is difficult to even see all the runners in the seven outer lanes, much less catch them. When Angelo Taylor drew Lane 1 for tonight's Olympic 400-meter hurdles race, he whistled to himself and wondered whether he had any chance to win.</p>
        <p>It had been a spotty night for the Americans. Marion Jones cruised through the second round of the 200 meters in 22.50 seconds and qualified efficiently for Friday's long jump final, leaping 22 feet 3 inches on her only attempt. Chris Huffins led the decathlon after five events. But Gail Devers stopped during the 100-meter hurdles semifinals, saying she had aggravated a hamstring injury. And until the very last stride, it appeared that Taylor, too, would not find fulfillment in the 400 hurdles.</p>
        <p>He ran a smooth, patient race, though, making a ferocious charge over the final three hurdles. At the tape he made a desperate lean and won the gold medal in 47.50 seconds in a photo finish over Hadi Souan Somayli of Saudi Arabia, who took second in 47.53 for his country's first Olympic medal. Somayli had the lead out of the final turn, but he leaned backward over the 10th hurdle and lost slight momentum, the difference between gold and silver.</p>
        <p>Not only did Taylor finish first in the dreaded Lane 1, he set a personal best by 12-hundredths of a second. It was the fastest race ever won from the innermost lane in this event. Still, the outcome was so close that Taylor did not realize he won. He knelt to pray, and only when he heard his name over the public-address system did he learn that he was an Olympic champion.</p>
        <p>''I thought it was going to be a tough race, and I didn't know if I was going to be able to do it,'' said the 21-year-old Taylor, who was just out of a suburban Atlanta high school during the 1996 Games. ''This let me know I could run from any lane.''</p>
        <p>Winning from Lane 1 would not be an obstacle, Taylor's friend Terrence Trammell persuaded him before the race. They had been high school teammates in Decatur, Ga., and Trammell won a silver medal in the 110-meter hurdles Monday night. ''Shock the world from Lane 1,'' Trammell shouted by cell phone while Taylor was warming up.</p>
        <p>It was not unprecedented to win a gold medal in the 400-meter hurdles from the inside lane. At the 1972 Games in Munich, John Akii-Bua of Uganda set a world record in 47.82 seconds. Before tonight's race, Taylor convinced himself that there would be one huge advantage on the inside. He was the fastest sprinter among the hurdlers, with a personal best of 44.89 seconds in the open 400. The others would not be able to see him coming. When he slingshot himself out of the final curve, they would have to begin chasing him just as their legs grew heavy with fatigue.</p>
        <p>''I told myself to stay relaxed,'' Taylor said. ''Those guys know I have the best speed. There was more pressure on them than me.''</p>
        <p>At DeKalb High School, Taylor learned to run on a cement track. He tried to pattern himself after the two-time Olympic champion Edwin Moses, who attended Morehouse College in Atlanta. And when he attended one day of the Atlanta Olympics, it was to watch Derrick Adkins win the 400-meter hurdles. They later became training partners.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Taylor ran patiently on the tight curves, measuring his speed to jump fluidly over each hurdle, taking 13 steps between the first eight hurdles and 14 between the final two as he made his charge, seeing Somayli out of the corner of his eye, chasing him down with a final lean, winning by the thickness of his chest.</p>
        <p>''I always watched the Olympics and thought, 'That could be me one day,' '' Taylor said. ''My day is here.''</p>
        <p>If there was a more impressive performance, it came in the women's 400-meter hurdles. Irina Privalova of Russia established herself as one of the most versatile Olympians ever, winning in a personal best, 53.02 seconds, eight years after winning a bronze medal in the 100 meters at the Barcelona Games.</p>
        <p>''I thought I would get a good result, but I never thought I would win a gold medal,'' said the 31-year-old Privalova, who defeated the 1996 champion, Deon Hemmings of Jamaica. ''This medal means more. I was younger and healthier before. This one took a lot more effort.''</p>
        <p>Jones also demonstrated her versatility as she continued her quest to become the first female track and field athlete to win five gold medals in one Olympics. Her attempt has been complicated by the revelation that her husband, the shot-putter C. J. Hunter, had tested positive for the steroid nandrolone. The track is her one refuge from the turmoil and suspicion that now attend her own performance.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Jones took a sizable lead, then downshifted across the finish line of the 200 heats. Then she needed only one attempt in her most uncertain event to qualify for the long jump final. Only Heike Drechsler of Germany, the 1992 Olympic champion, had a longer jump tonight, at 22-5 1/4.</p>
        <p>''Without a doubt, the last couple days have been really difficult,'' Jones said. ''Right now, I have gold medals to win.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''Once I stepped on the track, everything that had happened the last couple days was in the back of my head.''</p>
        <p>Jones's chances of winning five gold medals seemed to grow more precarious, however, when Devers pulled up in a semifinal heat of the 100-meter hurdles. Devers is a two-time Olympic champion in the open 100 meters and was scheduled to run a leg of the 4x100-meter relay on Saturday. Her status is now uncertain. Inger Miller will run the relay, her coach, John Smith, said, but she will not be fully recovered from a left hamstring injury that kept her out of the 100 and 200 sprints.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be a challenge,'' Smith said of the American relay. ''The Bahamas has four healthy girls. Jamaica has four healthy girls. We don't. That's a problem.''</p>
        <p>For the second time in her Olympic career, Devers experienced a bizarre conclusion to the 100 hurdles. At the 1992 Barcelona Games, she led after nine hurdles, only to clip the final hurdle with her lead foot. She stumbled across the finish line, but four others beat her to the tape.</p>
        <p>Tonight, she seemed to run smoothly over the first four hurdles, only to stop before reaching the fifth. Devers has suffered from hamstring problems throughout her career, complicated now by a bout of sciatica. The left hamstring began to tighten on her during the rounds of the hurdles, she said, adding that she thought during the final she would ''go all out until the leg fell off.''</p>
        <p>But the hamstring began to clench, and would not loosen, and she could not go on, she said. She dismissed any suggestion that she felt jinxed in the 100 hurdles.</p>
        <p>''I don't think luck is involved in track,'' Devers said. ''It's skills. This day, my skills were not enough to get me through this, mentally or physically.''</p>
        <p>Had her leg not restricted her, Devers should have easily won the race. Olga Shishigina of Kazakhstan took the gold in 12.65 seconds. Devers has run eight races faster than that this season, including 12.61 in the first round of the Olympics. Second place tonight went to Glory Alozie of Nigeria, who finished the Games in poignant triumph after beginning it with the death of her fiance, Hyginus Anugo, a sprinter who was hit and killed by a bus here early this month.</p>
        <p>''I thought I would go home, but I was encouraged by my coach,'' Alozie said. ''I still feel what happened, but my friends, my coach and my family helped make me feel happy again.''</p>
        <p>Devers was not the only favorite to experience frustration tonight. Wilson Kipketer, the Kenyan who has become a world record-holder as a Danish citizen, let the 800 meters unfold too slowly and could not take the lead with his urgent kick at the finish. Nils Schumann of Germany won in 1 minute 45.08 seconds, while Kipketer was second in 1:45.14, four seconds off his world record. It was the slowest winning time in the 800 since the 1980 Moscow Olympics.</p>
        <p>Tomas Dvorak of the Czech Republic, the world record-holder in the decathlon, slumped to seventh after five events. Huffins stood first with 4,554 points, although he struggles with the javelin and the 1,500 meters on the second day.</p>
        <p>Sergei Bubka, the world record-holder in the pole vault, continued his Olympic frustration in a career that has been diminished by injury. He missed all three tries at 18-8 1/2 in tonight's qualifying round. After winning gold in 1988 at the Seoul Games, Bubka has reached the final only once in the past three Games, failing on that occasion to clear any height.</p>
        <p>Another drug scandal hit track and field today when Mihaela Melinte of Romania, the gold-medal favorite in the women's hammer throw, was told on the track before the qualifying round that she had tested positive for nandrolone. Victories were also tempered by the knowledge that Shishigina in the 100 hurdles and Elina Zvereva of Belarus in the discus had previously served drug suspensions.</p>
        <p>Such is the suspicion in track and field that Devers was asked whether she withdrew to avoid having to take a drug test.</p>
        <p>''You can't infer one thing from the next, and one person to the next,'' Devers said. ''It's not fair. Me pulling up is an injury. If people are going to speculate, they are going to speculate. If that was my concern, I wouldn't have started this Olympic Games.''</p>
