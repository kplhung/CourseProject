        <p>The British conglomerate the Rank Group said that it would sell its holidays division, which includes hotels and camping parks, to the Bourne Leisure Group for as much as $:700 million, or about $980 million. The privately held Bourne Leisure, which runs parks throughout Britain, said it would pay $:650 million up front and an additional $:50 million in two years if Rank's Butlin's resorts unit meets profit targets. Rank's shares rose 5.9 percent, to 161 pence, or about $2.24. Rank has been shedding businesses, like Odeon cinema and a stake in Universal Studios Escape, to pay down debt.</p>
