        <p>Bob Wright, the president of NBC, has heard all the criticism of the network's coverage of the Sydney Olympics and has seen the ratings fall below NBC's expectations.</p>
        <p>But he remains steadfastly upbeat. ''I feel terrific about the coverage,'' he said by phone from Sydney. ''I'm finding the whole experience very exhilarating.''</p>
        <p>Partly he is referring to the experience of being in Sydney itself, traveling to the event sites, which he described as spectacularly beautiful. But Wright emphasized that NBC is making no apologies either for its coverage or for its ratings performance.</p>
        <p>The ratings may have fallen short of NBC's promises to advertisers, but, he said, ''We're reaching 23, 24, 25 million viewers a night.'' That has been good enough on most nights to beat all of NBC's network competition combined, validating, by NBC's definition, the status of the Olympics as one of television's signature big events.</p>
        <p>''In this era of fractionalizing audiences,'' Wright said, ''the ability of the Olympics to gather audiences of that size will only get more valuable.''</p>
        <p>He also said that he was encouraged that the ratings began to increase during the second week of broadcasts, something that usually does not happen. But that upward trend did not hold up through Tuesday night, when NBC suffered a steep drop-off, scoring just a 12.4 rating, one of the lowest for any night of an Olympics in history.</p>
        <p>NBC executives said yesterday that they expected a weaker performance because the second Tuesday, with gymnastics over and no main track-and-field events scheduled, always brings a lull in competition.</p>
        <p>NBC filled with cycling, volleyball and a heavy dose of weight lifting. Audiences fell away. From 8 p.m. to 9 p.m., the Olympics came close to being beaten by a rerun of a celebrity edition of the ABC game show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>Wright, while praising the production work in Sydney under Dick Ebersol, said he agreed with some of the reasons being cited for NBC's struggle with the ratings.</p>
        <p>''That time difference is really tough,'' Wright said. ''I don't really know what Dick could have done about that.'' Certainly NBC made its ratings situation more difficult by extending its prime-time hours from 7 p.m. to midnight, up from the traditional 8 to 11. ''That set up some rather nasty comparisons with past Olympics,'' Wright said.</p>
        <p>But like many other NBC executives, Wright totally disparaged the comparison to the live telecasts of events being carried by Canadian television, noting that NBC could hardly pay $705 million for rights to the Games and then run them live from 3 a.m. to 8 a.m, as the CBC is doing. ''That isn't even working for Canada,'' Wright said, noting that ratings there are ''minuscule.''</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the rating patterns in the United States have taken an odd turn, with the Olympics playing best in cities where they are the most delayed. Among the top 20 cities, the highest ratings are from West Coast markets like Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles, while only one city in the Eastern time zone, Philadelphia, is among the top 20. To NBC executives this suggests that the time delay is not completely the problem, though it may have something to do with the media concentration in the East, where the results seem inescapable.</p>
        <p>Wright pointed out that the ratings news has been good for NBC elsewhere than in network prime time. The ''Today'' show is at near-record rating levels, and NBC's cable channels, MSNBC and CNBC, are up by two and three times more than their normal ratings.</p>
        <p>Wright recalled that eight years ago in Barcelona, Spain, NBC tried the infamous ''Triplecast,'' pay-per-view supplementary coverage of the Games on cable channels in partnership with Cablevision. ''We each ended up losing $50 million,'' he said. ''This year we have the true Triplecast. Baseball and softball and boxing are totally available on cable, and they're doing very well.''</p>
        <p>Over all, without citing specific figures,  Wright said, ''Financially, we're going to be fine.'' Before the Games he had predicted that NBC would make a very small profit.</p>
        <p>Still, everything that is happening to NBC at Sydney, good and bad, is relevant to the network's financial future, because NBC has committed more than $3 billion in rights to the next five Olympics. Wright stressed that NBC remains enthusiastic about holding those rights, though he conceded that it is incumbent on NBC to improve on ways it can keep viewers informed about Olympic athletes between the Games.</p>
        <p>This is especially true with young viewers, he said, many of whom don't follow Olympic sports at all. ''The Internet will be a big part of that challenge,'' he said. NBC  will try to use the Internet to keep interest in Olympic athletes high.</p>
        <p>Keeping advertisers excited about supporting the Games may be the biggest challenge. Wright conceded that with the Salt Lake City Winter Games coming up in just 16 months, there is a risk of Olympic oversaturation. But he said that he would certainly not favor a return to the days when both winter and summer Olympics were held in the same year. ''If I'm an advertiser, that doesn't work for me,'' Wright said.</p>
        <p>Besides, he said, ''Salt Lake City is a domestic Olympics. That will take care of itself.'' He said NBC has already sold about 60 percent of the advertising time for Utah.</p>
        <p>But the Summer Games in Athens will follow only another 17 months after Salt Lake City. The figure for advertising sold for that production is at 20 percent. ''Athens is the next challenge,'' Wright said.</p>
