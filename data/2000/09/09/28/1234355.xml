        <p>Europe is rushing to tear down borders, but the Internet is toppling some of them even faster, making life distinctly uncomfortable for European policy makers.</p>
        <p>A big source of that discomfort is the threat of lost tax revenue, because European nations depend far more on taxes on consumption than the United States does. So in contrast to the United States -- where a federal commission failed to agree on how states should tax basic electronic commerce and mail-order sales like books, consumer electronics and other products -- European officials are pushing hard to adopt a seemingly narrow but potentially far-reaching proposal to ensure that digital products bought in Europe over the Internet do not escape taxation.</p>
        <p>Essentially, the legislation proposed in June by the European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the 15-nation European Union, defines digital products like software and video programming downloaded by computer as services rather than goods.</p>
        <p>The idea is to ensure that such transactions face the value-added tax, an elaborate system begun in Europe in which purchases are taxed at each stage from production to final sale. (However lucrative, it is a system that politicians in the United States have shied away from.)</p>
        <p>Normally in Europe, services would be taxed in the country of origin, meaning that European nations would gain no tax revenue from services flowing in from the outside. But this bill, which has stirred controversy not only on the Continent but among high-technology companies in the United States, would require companies outside Europe with sales here of such services exceeding 100,000 euros, or about $88,000, to register in one European country for the purpose of paying value-added taxes.</p>
        <p>The stakes are significant. In 1999, European e-commerce sales were $3.4 billion, or less than one-half of 1 percent of total sales. But by some estimates, such sales in Europe may rise as high as 12 percent of the total in the next few years. And while sales of digital products from outside Europe are only a small fraction of that, policy makers -- even more than their counterparts in the United States -- are fretting over possible lost revenue.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the United States, where relatively few people pay state sales taxes on Internet purchases, European governments already impose national value-added taxes on goods sold over the Internet within Europe. The tax rates and the list of goods covered vary from country to country. For services sold by European companies in Europe, the V.A.T. is paid by the selling company in its home country.</p>
        <p>As a result, European governments already tax e-commerce more than the United States does. The Internet Tax Freedom Act, passed by Congress in 1998, created a moratorium on sales taxes on e-commerce across state lines until 2001, and antitax forces in Congress have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to extend the moratorium until 2006.</p>
        <p>Washington has sought to coordinate Internet tax policies with the Europeans through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris. At an O.E.C.D. conference in Ottawa in 1998, the Europeans and the United States agreed on a list of principles for treating digital goods as services rather than manufactured products, to avoid customs duties on their delivery, and on jurisdiction in case of eventual taxation.</p>
        <p>But here, the issue is considered a pressing one. European governments depend for roughly 40 percent of their total revenue on value-added taxes, while state sales taxes in the United States make up only about 25 percent of total state tax revenue. The budget of the European Commission is financed almost entirely by the V.A.T.</p>
        <p>In Europe as in the United States, governments are also coming under pressure from traditional retailers that must collect taxes on all their sales -- taxes that Internet providers can skirt. The American software producer Symantec, for instance, which sells its Norton Utilities software to Europeans in several languages through its Web site, encourages customers to download the software directly, saying that there is ''no value-added tax, shipping or export charge.''</p>
        <p>Still, serious obstacles face the proposed European legislation, and enactment is far from certain. For one thing, the bill will not become effective unless it is approved and enacted into national law by all 15 members of the European Union. It also needs to pass in the European Parliament. So difficult is the debate expected to be that Thomas Tindemans, a tax expert in the Brussels office of the law firm White &amp; Case, said the delays would probably produce ''a de facto moratorium.''</p>
        <p>What makes the debate complex is that the proposed legislation affects not only software but also other electronic services like pay-for-use radio and television broadcasting.</p>
        <p>The path the Europeans have taken is not unlike the one Congress chose in July, when it passed legislation to resolve the issue of how to tax cellular phone use in the United States. Under the new rules, cell phones have a ''primary service area'' in which the telephone user pays state and local user taxes. But unlike the American legislation, the broader European measures face bitter opposition.</p>
        <p>The European legislators are treading a thin line. National governments -- at pains to see their industries close the gap with the United States, where Internet use by business and consumers is ahead of Europe's -- do not want to impose extra burdens. Yet officials in Brussels also worry that inaction could encourage individual countries to take unilateral action to prevent tax erosion. Mr. Tindemans of White &amp; Case said the goal appeared to be ''to force debate at the European level and try to coordinate it.''</p>
        <p>Initial criticism has been intense. In the United States, the Software and Information Industry Association, a trade group, assailed the draft as ''fatally flawed.'' Mark Bohannon, the group's general counsel, said the measure would be unenforceable because it is often impossible to tell where a customer is in cyberspace. He called the proposed law a step backward from international agreements not to tax the Internet.</p>
        <p>In Europe, just about every interest group seems unhappy. At Eurocommerce, a trade organization for wholesale and retail distributors, officials are preparing a catalog of objections, including ones to the provision setting the threshold at 100,000 euros. They say that would discriminate against small European companies that already pay the tax while their small rivals abroad would not.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the trade group hopes to use the issue as a cudgel to force governments to harmonize value-added tax rates at lower levels, arguing that the proposal encourages foreign companies to register in countries with little or no V.A.T. for digital products, like Britain, where the rate on some items is zero, rather than, say, Sweden and Denmark, where the uniform rate is 25 percent.</p>
        <p>''You have the theory,'' said the chief tax adviser at Eurocommerce, Dimitris Kalogeras. ''The practice is quite different.''</p>
        <p>Freddy Tengberg, chief executive of a company called Buyonet, could not agree more. When Mr. Tengberg, a former mechanical engineer with Exxon, set up his company in 1997 to sell software on the Web and to help other companies do likewise, he established headquarters in Sweden, but registered it in Seattle. The company sells all its products to Europe from the United States.</p>
        <p>Buyonet's main competitors, Mr. Tengberg explained in an interview, are American companies like Beyond.com that enable European customers to download their products without paying the value-added tax. If Buyonet added Sweden's 25 percent rate to its prices, he said, ''people just would not buy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tengberg, one of the most outspoken opponents of the legislation, called it ''primitive and impossible to enforce.'' The authorities in Europe, he argues, would have no power to force American companies to register. And if American authorities cooperated, he said, many companies would simply move the computers used to deliver their products ''to Uruguay, Burkina Faso or Brazil.''</p>
        <p>''In a digital world,'' he went on, ''where you deliver from doesn't matter. A buyer in Bahrain gets the same service as a buyer in Philadelphia. It's a beautiful fact, but for the tax man it's a nightmare.''</p>
        <p>Therese Torris, a tax specialist at Forrester Research B.V., regards such comments as nonsense. So far, she said, the market for directly downloaded digital products consists mainly of software sales to corporate customers.</p>
        <p>''Large companies have no incentive for tax evasion,'' Ms. Torris said, relying on governments for assistance in matters like antipiracy and copyright protection. Small businesses may seek to evade taxes, ''but it's not in the interest of big companies.''</p>
        <p>''When they have a problem,'' Ms. Torris added, ''they go to the government and the law.''</p>
        <p>She said European and American governments face a formidable challenge when digital goods are delivered online and paid for directly over the Internet. But she also said that the problem was purely technical and that companies specializing in tax-collection software were already providing solutions. Taxware International, for instance, recently began marketing software to track European value-added taxes.</p>
        <p>Stephane Buydens, a tax specialist at the O.E.C.D., said Europe's value-added tax system could more readily be adjusted than what exists in the United States, where 7,000 revenue jurisdictions create a minefield of differing sales tax rates, and there are contrasting definitions of taxable and nontaxable items.</p>
        <p>''In the long term, Europe will have to make some changes,'' he said. ''In the United States, the discussion is about the system itself.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Tengberg of Buyonet said that he, like many other executives of businesses operating in cyberspace, believes that the Internet ultimately spells the end of the European value-added tax system.</p>
        <p>''It works in a physical market,'' he said. ''It doesn't work here.''</p>
