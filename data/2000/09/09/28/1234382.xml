        <p>A3-14  Yugoslav Commission Says 2nd Election Must Be Held  Yugoslavia's government-controlled election commission said the opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica would have to meet President Slobodan Milosevic in a runoff on Oct. 8. Mr. Kostunica, whose supporters believe he got at least 50 percent of the vote, has vowed to boycott a second round. The announcement followed a huge demonstration in Belgrade in support of Mr. Kostunica.</p>

        <p>Soft-Money Spending Outstrips Campaigns' Own  Republican and Democratic Party organizations are far outspending both special interest groups and the Bush and Gore campaigns on television in the presidential election. Political analysts say the trend is transforming the parties and their soft-money donors this year from supporting players into full partners in the advertising efforts.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign is raising millions for an obscure fund limited to paying for legal and accounting costs. But recent solicitation letters for the fund suggest a donation will help the campaign attack Republicans, causing some campaign finance experts and Bush aides to say the messages are misleading and run afoul of federal election law.</p>
        <p>A23</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore challenged Gov. George W. Bush to agree to ban the use of unregulated party money on television and radio advertising for the rest of the presidential campaign. The night before, Mr. Bush told Larry King in a CNN interview that he was unlikely to agree to such a pact because he did not trust the Democrats to abide by it.</p>

        <p>Differences on Child Marketing  Four of eight Hollywood executives promised at a Senate hearing not to market R-rated films directly to children under 17, but four said they would not make such a promise, asserting that some R-rated movies were appropriate for children under 17 who went with their parents.</p>
        <p>A20</p>
        <p>Deal to Ease Cuba Sanctions  House and Senate leaders approved a deal to allow the sale of American food products to Cuba, clearing the way for the most significant rollback of United States sanctions against Cuba in four decades.</p>

        <p>Surplus Projection Grows  President Clinton said the government surplus would be larger than ever, and he accused Congressional Republicans of trying to devote much of it to special interests.</p>
        <p>A24</p>
        <p>Military Seeks More Money  Senior military commanders told Congress that the armed services needed a significant increase in military spending in the years ahead, suggesting amounts that would exceed what has been proposed by either major presidential candidate and consume a large part of the projected budget surplus.</p>

        <p>Public Interest in Private Space  Most privately owned public spaces in New York City, created in a tradeoff meant to give pedestrians a little extra breathing room as developers got extra-large buildings, have failed in some way, a study found. Gates that should be open are padlocked. Chairs meant for the public are used by restaurants. Plazas are filled with Dumpsters. And some spaces are just plain uninviting.</p>
