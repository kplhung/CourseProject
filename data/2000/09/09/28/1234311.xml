        <p>IT was a lovely September afternoon and I was doing what many like-minded souls do on weekends in autumn: playing football with friends. But instead of running around and possibly damaging valuable body parts, I was sitting in a comfortable chair at my friend Jenn Sturm's apartment.</p>
        <p>I held the video game controller while Jenn typed taunts at our opponent (who was in Michigan) on a keyboard attached to a Sega Dreamcast video game console. We were playing Sega's new SegaSports NFL 2K1 football game, the first Dreamcast title that has built-in connectivity to Sega's brand-new gaming network, SegaNet.</p>

        <p>IT was a lovely September afternoon and I was doing what many like-minded souls do on weekends in autumn: playing football with friends. But instead of running around and possibly damaging valuable body parts, I was sitting in a comfortable chair at my friend Jenn Sturm's apartment.</p>
        <p>I held the video game controller while Jenn typed taunts at our opponent (who was in Michigan) on a keyboard attached to a Sega Dreamcast video game console. We were playing Sega's new SegaSports NFL 2K1 football game, the first Dreamcast title that has built-in connectivity to Sega's brand-new gaming network, SegaNet.</p>
        <p>SegaNet, which opened its servers to gamers all over the country on Sept. 7, is a combination Internet service provider and high-speed private network. It was designed and built especially for people who like to play video games against opponents online, either from a PC or a Dreamcast console, which has a convenient 56K modem inside.</p>
        <p>People who sign up to use the network pay $21.95 per month and can also browse the Web from the Dreamcast. Customers also get a personal sega.net e-mail address, and to sweeten the pot, Sega is offering a $150 rebate check (which is about the price of the console these days) and a Dreamcast keyboard to customers who sign up for 18 months of SegaNet service.</p>
        <p>Playing games against other people over the Internet is nothing new. On the low-tech side, people have been e-mailing chess moves to opponents for years. More recently, battle games like Quake and StarCraft have drawn legions of faithful players into real-time online competitions. Ultima Online, a Web-based role-playing game cast in a medieval setting, has drawn players from more than 114 countries. Ultima Online players have even gotten married in real life, thus merging virtual and real community.</p>
        <p>And the concept of community is a big part of gaming, particularly with console games. I always found the old Atari 2600 to be most fun when I could whomp my sister in a game of Warlords after school. It was much better than playing Pac-Man by myself at the mall, because there was a human element there (not to mention sibling rivalry). The unpredictability and competitiveness of the game environment is a big part of the appeal for many.</p>
        <p>''Gaming has always been, certainly from our perspective, a societal undertaking,'' said Peter Moore, the president and chief operating officer of Sega of America Dreamcast. ''It's often been perceived as this lonely guy in his bedroom playing video games all night long on his own, but as our research tells us, when multiplayer games became popular, it became a way of kids getting together and playing against each other.''</p>
        <p>Speed and response to the things happening on screen are vital for surviving in a video game. And on those days when the Internet just crawls, playing a game is darn near impossible due to the agonizingly slow response on the screen to player input.</p>
        <p>To combat the problem, Sega.com, the online-entertainment company founded by Sega Enterprises Ltd. in Japan, created SegaNet just for the dial-up-modem game-playing environment. SegaNet engineers created regional hubs and reduced the number of hops (all the different computers a particular packet of data bounces to on its way to its destination) for the connection to increase the network's speed. The network was created to work with 56K modems, although broadband options will be available later.</p>
        <p>I figured if I was going to try SegaNet, I should play with a professional. Jenn, in addition to being a whiz who regularly fillets me in the Dreamcast fighting game Soul Calibur, is also the director of systems for Flooz.com, an online gift currency site.</p>
        <p>We popped in the NFL 2K1 game disk, connected a telephone cord to the modem jack and attached the Dreamcast keyboard to the game console. It didn't take us too long to find the option to connect to the network, since it's right there on the game's main screen. (People who buy the football game get 50 free hours to try out SegaNet, and gamers can also sign up at www.sega.net.)</p>
        <p>The instructions on the screen walked us through setting up a user name and a password for SegaNet, as well as a local access number. We connected to the network at 28.8 kilobits per second. We soon landed in the lobby, where could see how many people were connected to the network at any given time and where they were from, based on the information from the SegaNet user account. To strike fear into the hearts of our opponents, we chose the online name TruckerMan for our first SegaNet experience.</p>
        <p>The game includes a chat program so that you can type comments on the keyboard before and during the game, and we soon found ourselves in a match with someone from Michigan. The NFL 2K1 game itself is hyper-realistic, with beautifully rendered players and all the trappings of a televised game, like multiple camera angles, instant replay and announcers.</p>
        <p>Despite our connection at half the potential speed of the modem, Jenn thought the game's response times were pretty good. There were also only about 50 or 60 people connected to the network at the time, which might have had something to do with it. We traded moves with the person in Michigan smoothly enough to make it seem as if he were right there in Brooklyn with us.</p>
        <p>Jenn went back on the network one weeknight a few days later and noticed some slow response times in the chat function, as well as in the game's team selection and setup; it might have been because three times as many people logged on, compared with our first time.</p>
        <p>Sega representatives said voice-chat capabilities were in development for future games, which is good, because it was rather hard to type in the chat window while playing. So I handled the actual gameplay -- and promptly got our quarterback sacked three plays in a row. (TruckerMan turned out to be one of those ''all talk and no action'' kind of guys.)</p>
        <p>The Sega Dreamcast platform has a lot of competition coming up. Microsoft has announced plans for a game console called the X-Box, and Nintendo is working on its new GameCube device. And then there's Sony's much-anticipated PlayStation2, which is set to appear in the United States in late October.</p>
        <p>With CD, DVD and online capabilities, PlayStation2 looks like it wants to be an all-purpose entertainment center, so Sega's decision to concentrate on pure, hard-core gaming over the phone lines sort of sets it apart.</p>
        <p>The company plans to steadily release game titles with the built-in network functions for SegaNet, including a scion of online game royalty, Quake III Arena, next month.</p>
        <p>Gamers are a fussy lot, so whether SegaNet takes off depends on whether it can keep up with the whims and demands of its target audience. For a network that has just come to life, it's off to a pretty good start as a network and a community.</p>
        <p>And TruckerMan is really looking forward to Quake III Arena on the Dreamcast.</p>
