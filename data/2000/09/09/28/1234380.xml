        <p>President Clinton bragged today that the government had a bigger budget surplus than ever before and then accused Congressional Republicans of trying to devote much of the money to special interests.</p>
        <p>''I am concerned, frankly, about the size and last-minute nature of this year's Congressional spending spree,'' Mr. Clinton said as he announced revised White House projections showing a federal budget surplus of more than $230 billion this year.</p>
        <p>The annual standoff over the enactment of 13 spending bills needed to keep the government running is once again going down to the wire, though Congress is poised to extend the time limit.</p>
        <p>The Senate is scheduled to vote on a stop-gap spending measure on Thursday that will keep government agencies functioning until Oct. 6, seven days beyond the official end of the fiscal year at midnight on Saturday. The House approved the temporary spending bill earlier this week.</p>
        <p>Republicans responded angrily to the president's suggestion that they were acting irresponsibly in supporting increases in the budgets of some domestic programs. They said it was their actions that brought about the surpluses now being trumpeted by Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's volley of words came the same day he sent John D. Podesta, his chief of staff, and Jack Lew, the director of the Office of Management and the Budget, to Capitol Hill to speed up negotiations on some of the thorny issues on some of the bills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Podesta and Mr. Lew spent much of their time meeting with Republican and Democratic negotiators from the House and Senate who are trying to hammer out a compromise on an $18 billion measure to finance the Interior Department and other agencies, including the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
        <p>Administration officials and some members of Congress complained that the Interior spending bill had been loaded up at the last minute with a raft of amendments known as riders.</p>
        <p>A number of these amendments -- including one that would halt studies on the feasibility of tearing down several dams in the Pacific Northwest, a move championed by environmentalists to allow salmon a free run to their upstream spawning areas -- have been pushed by Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of  Washington, who is locked in a tight re-election contest.</p>
        <p>Also hanging up the bill is a debate about a provision to establish a $45 billion trust fund over a 15-year period to conserve land for recreation and wilderness areas. The provision, known as the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, would not be subject to the vagaries of the annual budgeting process, but instead would be paid for by royalties from offshore oil drilling.</p>
        <p>Because of that, the heads of appropriations subcommittees who control the money for the Interior Department fear they would lose power and have joined with several lawmakers from Western states to oppose the provision.</p>
        <p>''It's not that Senator Gorton disagrees with its goals,'' said an aide to the senator, speaking of the conservation provision. ''He disagrees with the fact that it creates an entitlement. And that says this is more important than education or health care.''</p>
        <p>While the Interior Department spending measure remained stalled, negotiators reported some progress on the approximately $55 billion transportation spending measure. That bill, which provides money for air traffic controllers and highway and mass transit systems, has been hung up in a House and Senate conference committee trying to iron out differences between separate measures the two bodies passed.</p>
        <p>Progress on the measure has been stalled by disagreement over provisions to block new rules requiring longer rest periods for long-haul truckers. Also holding up agreement has been a provision requiring states  to adopt more stringent standards on drunken driving or risk losing part of their federal highway money.</p>
        <p>Negotiators working on that measure say an agreement is near on a provision that would essentially reduce the penalties that states would face if they fail to adopt the tougher federal standard.</p>
