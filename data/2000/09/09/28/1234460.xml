        <p>Three other employees, Pammi Lamba, Suher Khalfan and Ilamir Ramolia, have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of selling without a license and were sentenced to conditional releases. Mr. Andrescu and his brokers were accused of promising high returns on investments in a company that they said was about to go public. But the stock was never issued.</p>
