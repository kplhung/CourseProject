      <abstract>
        <p>Peter J Wilson letter on Joel Brinkley's Sept 21 article notes Microsoft's word processing software has unfair advantage because it is included at no added cost with many new computers</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The statement that ''WordPerfect wins hands down by one measure: price'' is only true, sadly, if you assume that the new word processing user is actually choosing to buy the word processor. But many computers are sold with the Microsoft product included at no additional charge with their newly purchased computer. So purchasers of new computers often find their choices to be between accepting the free Microsoft Word or, after declining that, purchasing WordPerfect. For most, the choice is obvious.</p>

        <p>Allowing Microsoft to offer bundled application software to PC system vendors is the real Microsoft monopoly threat. And WordPerfect's leadership in the word-processing market is a clear victim.</p>
