        <p>Vice President Al Gore challenged Gov. George W. Bush today to agree to ban the use of unregulated party money on television and radio advertising for the rest of the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made his offer this morning in separate telephone calls to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, the authors of legislation that would ban so-called soft money contributions altogether. On Tuesday night, Mr. Bush told CNN's Larry King in a nationally televised interview that he was unlikely to accept such a pact because he did not trust the Democrats to abide by it.</p>
        <p>In a statement tonight, a Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, ''I just doubt that somebody who has recognized no controlling legal authority over his campaign fund-raising is going to abide by a handshake now.''</p>
        <p>Because the Democrats have raised far less soft money than the Republicans and because Mr. Bush had all but declined before Mr. Gore announced his acceptance, the vice president's offer would seem to bear little political cost.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Feingold, in a telephone interview, said he remained hopeful that a similar agreement between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio, the candidates for United States Senate in New York, would ultimately help press Mr. Bush to accept the deal.</p>
        <p>''As the momentum on something like this builds, it's hard avoid it,'' Mr. Feingold said. ''We see a real sea change occurring in the use of soft money. It's finally getting the taint it deserves.'' Mr. McCain could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made his offer on a campaign day when both he and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, spent considerable effort rebutting one of the very advertisements that the Democrats would propose to eliminate.</p>
        <p>In a speech on Medicare policy at a community center in Altoona, Iowa, the vice president railed against a Republican National Committee commercial that he said had mischaracterized his plan for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Mr. Lieberman, speaking at a center for the elderly in Milwaukee, made the same charge.</p>
        <p>After a week when some polls have shown Mr. Bush gaining ground, it was the first public indication that the Republican ads had succeeded in placing the Democrats on the defensive. ''Our message is getting through on Medicare, particularly in paid media,'' a Bush aide said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's soft-money challenge to Mr. Bush builds on a similar position taken by the vice president in March, when he proposed that both campaigns forgo those contributions and campaign through frequent debates rather than television advertising. While acknowledging at the time that he was an imperfect messenger because of his role in the Clinton administration's fund-raising, Mr. Gore said he would make campaign finance reform a priority of his campaign.</p>
        <p>But with no agreement reached at that point, both parties have raised huge sums this year. The Republican National Committee collected $153 million through Aug. 31 while the Democratic National Committee raised an estimated $80 million to $100 million, party officials said. Much of that money is soft.</p>
        <p>The Democratic ticket has been on a fund-raising tear for the last five weeks. Tonight, less than eight hours after issuing his challenge, Mr. Gore attended two fund-raisers in Washington that raised $3.5 million for the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>The two presidential campaigns have ended their own fund-raising as a condition for receiving $68 million apiece in public financing. But the parties can continue to raise unlimited sums, with few restrictions on the size of individual gifts, and much of that money can be spent on advertising that directly promotes the candidates.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. McCain and Mr. Feingold sent a letter to Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush encouraging them to join Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio in swearing off advertising financed with soft money. After speaking to the two senators this morning, Mr. Gore released a letter to them announcing his acceptance.</p>
        <p>''If the Bush-Cheney campaign will take the same action with the Republican National Committee, I will call upon the Democratic National Committee to cease all soft-money radio or television advertising that aims to influence the presidential election,'' he wrote. ''And I will also call on all independent organizations to do so as well.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. King asked Mr. Bush whether he would accept such an arrangement, he responded, ''Probably not, but I'd have to see what it says.'' He added, ''I don't trust him, to be frank with you.''</p>
        <p>In his appearance in Altoona and a subsequent rally in Des Moines today, Mr. Gore emphasized his prescription drug coverage plan as a means of setting the policy stage for his first debate with Mr. Bush, next Tuesday in Boston. Beginning Saturday, Mr. Gore plans to devote three days to debate preparation in Sarasota, Fla., where Mr. Gore also practiced for his 1996 vice-presidential debate with Jack F. Kemp.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman both raised objections today to the Republican Medicare advertisement, which charges that Mr. Gore's prescription drug proposal would require seniors to join ''a government H.M.O.'' New Republican mailings to elderly voters in key states make a similar charge.</p>
        <p>''You know what that refers to?'' Mr. Gore asked today. ''That's the way they describe Medicare. There's no big government H.M.O. That's the way they describe Medicare. Medicare's not an H.M.O. You get to choose your doctor. You get to choose your pharmacy. You have the choice.''</p>
