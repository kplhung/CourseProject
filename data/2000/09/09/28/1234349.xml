        <p>Supported by Robert E. Rubin, the former secretary of the Treasury Department, and Warren Buffet, the billionaire investor, Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged yesterday to protect the federal budget surplus from Republican ''tax schemes'' by proposing legislation to limit tax cuts and new spending.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, laying out one of her most detailed plans for the budget surplus since entering the New York Senate race, proposed mandatory ''debt-reduction caps'' that would make it more difficult for Congress to use expected budget surpluses for cutting taxes or paying for new programs.</p>
        <p>Her plan, similar in general terms to the one proposed by Vice President Al Gore, goes further than Mr. Gore's by setting aside more money for debt reduction and imposing legislative hurdles for making exceptions.</p>
        <p>Under Mrs. Clinton's plan, 20 percent of the budget surplus each year over the next 10 years, apart from money for Social Security and Medicare, would be reserved for reducing federal debt. That would create a pool of about $360 billion, her campaign staff estimated.</p>
        <p>If Congress wanted to spend that money or use it to offset tax cuts, it would have to do so with a vote of three-fifths of the members of both houses, she said. In addition, the estimated $2.7 trillion surplus in the Social Security and Medicare accounts would be set aside for debt reduction, she said.</p>
        <p>According to her campaign staff's estimates, Mrs. Clinton's proposal would devote about $60 billion more over the 10 years for debt reduction than would Mr. Gore's budget-surplus plan. Mr. Gore's plan also does not require a three-fifths vote for breaking the spending and tax cut limit.</p>
        <p>''We have to put first things first and be conservative in how we use this surplus and project our expenditures,'' Mrs. Clinton said during an economic forum at Columbia University. ''I would propose that we set some limits on what we can do with the surplus and just keep everybody on the same page.''</p>
        <p>But the Republicans said the spending habits of Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats, not their party's proposed tax cuts, are the biggest threat to the surplus. Representative Rick A. Lazio, speaking in Newburgh after touring a riverfront development project, suggested that Mrs. Clinton's policy proposals would leave little of the surplus left to apply toward reducing the debt. He cited a report by the National Taxpayers Union, a conservative group, that said her economic and education plans would nearly wipe out the surplus.</p>
        <p>''So, it's fine rhetoric, but when you add up the numbers, it doesn't add up,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''My economic plan would reserve three-quarters of the surplus to protect Social Security and Medicare, pay down the debt and also invest in some important priorities, like education.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton used her budget-surplus proposal as an opportunity once again to criticize Mr. Lazio's tax plan, which she says would give back too much of the projected $4.5 trillion surplus to taxpayers, and which Mr. Rubin said would ''reject fiscal discipline.'' Speaking to an audience of students organized by the university's College Democrats club, Mrs. Clinton said they must look beyond their immediate self-interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio spent the day in the Hudson Valley, touring businesses and the Newburgh waterfront and speaking at a business breakfast in Rockland County. The visits were intended to highlight the potential for his plan for improving the economy through an increase in partnerships between the federal government and the private sector, and through lower taxes that Mr. Lazio says will stimulate the economy.</p>
        <p>''I think what we're doing here is we're demonstrating that there is one candidate in this race who has got the capacity to build the kind of partnerships that will be necessary to improve the quality of life for New York,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
