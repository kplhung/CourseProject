        <p>After watching his opponent's popularity rise in the polls over the last month, Gov. George W. Bush got a dose of good news over the last few days. The momentum is now his, with three new nationwide polls showing that he has regained some of the ground he lost to Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Bush seems to have the edge in at least two of the polls. But is it real?</p>
        <p>The basic fact is, no one is ahead. When the polls are looked at together, the presidential race is so close that it is impossible to give either candidate an edge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush got his most encouraging news from The Los Angeles Times, which reported yesterday that thanks to a 22-point advantage among men, Mr. Bush was now leading Mr. Gore, 48 percent to 42 percent. But since the margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points, the findings have to be considered a statistical tie.</p>
        <p>In addition, three out of four people interviewed said the coming debates would affect their decisions.</p>
        <p>Polls differ in the samples they use, the questions they ask, the ways  they interpret the numbers and the ways they report the numbers.</p>
        <p>Some polls report the preferences for all registered voters, which represents the views of about 80 percent of all American adults. But based on voter turnout in years past, not all 80 percent are going to vote in November, so some polls use a series of questions to determine who is most likely to vote. This group accounts for about 50 percent of all adults.</p>
        <p>The Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll is reporting the results of a daily tracking poll, which involves taking separate national samples for each of three days and averaging them. Each day, they add a new sample and drop the oldest one. Tracking polls usually are very short, often with as few as 10 questions. Other recent polls, like those of Newsweek and The Los Angeles Times, use one sample over several days and have much longer questionnaires.</p>
        <p>Not all polls word their questions the same way -- even on the most basic question. When asking voters whom they now support, some polls use only the names of the presidential candidates while others include the names of running mates.</p>
        <p>Then there is the margin of sampling error, which unavoidably occurs from randomly sampling the active residential telephone exchanges across the country.</p>
        <p>A margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for example, refers to three percentage points on each candidate's number. So in a hypothetical race where there is a two-point gap, say of 44 percent for John Smith and 46 percent for Bill Jones, the race could be as far apart as 41 percent for Mr. Smith and 49 percent for Mr. Jones, or the advantage could fall to Mr. Smith, 47 percent to 43 percent.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Gallup/CNN/USA Today poll reported a nationwide telephone tracking poll taken Sept. 24-26, with 696 likely voters. Mr. Gore was the choice of 44 percent of the respondents, while Mr. Bush was the choice of 46 percent.</p>
        <p>Princeton Survey Research Associates took a nationwide telephone poll for Newsweek from Sept. 20 to 22 with 766 likely voters. In that poll Mr. Gore was the choice of 47 percent and Mr. Bush was the choice of 45 percent.</p>
        <p>Like the Los Angeles Times poll, the two have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. When the polls are averaged, Mr. Gore has 44 percent and Mr. Bush has 46 percent.</p>
        <p>One other thing to keep in mind is that when pollsters ask people about their votes, they usually ask whom they would vote for ''if the election were being held today.'' But nearly six weeks will pass, and many polls will be taken before anyone votes.</p>
