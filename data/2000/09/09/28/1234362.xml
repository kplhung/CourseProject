        <p>Appraisal of new commercial being broadcast by Gore-Lieberman campaign; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Gore-Lieberman campaign began broadcasting a new commercial, titled ''Veteran,'' this week that highlights stands on several issues, including tax cuts, welfare, child support and Internet pornography, that are the kinds Republicans have used in the past against Democrats. It is being broadcast in 17 swing states, although the Gore campaign would not identify them.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Campaign Company</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The 30-second commercial begins with a black and white picture of a young Al Gore in Vietnam and then switches to color footage of Mr. Gore with his family and with his wife, Tipper, and campaigning. It then moves to color footage of workers and families.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Vietnam veteran. Father of four. Married 30 years. Al Gore will fight for families. Tax cuts for middle-class families including a $10,000-a-year tax deduction for college tuition. Continue welfare reform with time limits, work requirements. Force deadbeat parents to take responsibility for their children. A crime victims' bill of rights to protect victims, not just criminals. Fight violence and pornography on the Internet, helping parents block out what children shouldn't see. Al Gore. He'll put his values to work for us.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mr. Gore does have proposals in the areas he mentions, and President Clinton did sign an overhaul of the welfare system into law in 1996, establishing time limits. Republicans argue that in several cases their proposals are tougher or more rigorous than Mr. Gore's. What Mr. Gore does not say is that his $500 billion tax relief plan would not help all middle-class families. It is intended to give tax relief for certain social goals; to benefit, a family must meet certain criteria, like having a parent in long-term care or a child in college or a child in day care.</p>
        <p>SCORE CARD -- Although this Gore advertisement is ostensibly about individual issues, its real purpose is signaled in its tag line, ''He'll put his values to work for us.'' Republicans are traditionally viewed as more mainstream on cultural and social values than Democrats, and that perception was only strengthened by the president's affair with a White House intern.</p>
        <p>Without ever mentioning Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore distances himself from him somewhat in this commercial. He mentions his service in Vietnam. (Neither Mr. Clinton nor Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, served in Vietnam.) And by boasting of his 30-year marriage, Mr. Gore emphasizes that he is a family man.</p>
        <p>The issues the advertisement covers -- tax cutting, welfare, child support, crime and fighting pornography -- are ones the Republicans had been capitalizing on for years until Mr. Clinton began to move his party to the center and stole some of their thunder. This shows Mr. Gore also setting down markers to fight off accusations that he is a big spender or that he is soft on crime or welfare.</p>
