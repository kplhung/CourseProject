        <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport today denied the Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan's appeal to regain the gold medal stripped from her by the International Olympic Committee because she tested positive for a banned substance.</p>
        <p>The three-member court ruled that it did not matter that the drug pseudoephedrine was taken in the form of cold medicine or that it did not enhance her performance at the individual all-around event.

        <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport today denied the Romanian gymnast Andreea Raducan's appeal to regain the gold medal stripped from her by the International Olympic Committee because she tested positive for a banned substance.</p>
        <p>The three-member court ruled that it did not matter that the drug pseudoephedrine was taken in the form of cold medicine or that it did not enhance her performance at the individual all-around event. What mattered, the panel decided, was that she committed a doping offense in violation of the Olympic antidoping code.</p>
        <p>''A strict liability test must thus be applied,'' the court said in a statement, ''the consequence being automatic disqualification as a matter of law and in fairness to all other athletes.''</p>
        <p>In its ruling, the panel said factors such as her age, her weight and her need for the medication were irrelevant. The panel held that the ''presence of a prohibited substance in a competitor's bodily fluid'' is the threshold issue, ''irrespective of whether or not the competitor intended to ingest the prohibited substance.''</p>
        <p>The I.O.C. recognized that Raducan, who turns 17 on Saturday, did not intentionally violate the code, but refused to make an individual exception to the antidoping code for her. Jacques Rogge, vice chairman of the I.O.C.'s medical commission, said that revoking her gold medal ''was one of the worst experiences I have had in my Olympic life.''</p>
        <p>''Having to strip the gold medal from the individual for something she didn't intentionally do was very tough,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Raducan, a 4-foot-10, 82-pound gymnast, performs with a pixie-ish, crowd-pleasing style reminiscent of her legendary Romanian predecessor, Nadia Comaneci. Raducan was the first Romanian to win the gold in the all-around since Comaneci did it in 1976. Although Raducan was stripped of the all-around gold, she was allowed to keep the gold she won as part of the team competition and the silver medal she won in the vault.</p>
        <p>The court added that it is ''aware of the impact of its decision on a fine, young, elite athlete. It finds, in balancing the interests of Miss Raducan with the commitment of the Olympic movement to drug-free sport, the anti-doping code must be enforced without compromise.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Ioachin Oana, the Romanian team doctor who administered the medication to Raducan, has been expelled from the Sydney Summer Games, the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Games and the 2004 Summer Games in Athens.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, when the appeal was filed, there were reports that Raducan's teammates, who were elevated to gold and silver medals, would return them in protest. But Romanian national team officials said today that they would not do that.</p>
        <p>Several I.O.C. members sounded sympathetic toward Raducan, even though they were the ones defending the decision to strip the medal.</p>
        <p>''My heart is with the athlete but it's a decision that stood the test of arbitration, and everybody must live with that,'' Kevan Gosper of Australia, an I.O.C. executive board member, said after the ruling. ''It's a decision that was put to the test. It's a nonambiguous one, and it demonstrates we're serious about doping, if anyone had any doubts.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the circumstances, Raducan tested positive for a banned substance.</p>
        <p>''I lived the most humiliating moment of my life when I had to turn in Andreea's medal,'' Octavian Belu, the coach of the Romanian team, said on Wednesday. ''If they decide to give it back, I would walk all the way to the Olympic village to bring the medal back to its rightful owner.''</p>
        <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport is an independent, international body created to resolve disputes over discipline and contracts. Based in Lausanne, Switzerland, it establishes a branch in the Olympic city during the Games.</p>
