        <p>RUSSIA: AMERICAN CHARGED AS SPY -- Prosecutors formally filed espionage charges against Edmond Pope, the 54-year-old former United States Navy captain arrested in April while buying plans for a Russian torpedo propulsion system. A trial was set for next month. A lawyer for Mr. Pope, who runs a company specializing in foreign marine equipment, said the system is a decade old and had previously been exported. Mr. Pope faces 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: NORWEGIANS TO DIVE TO KURSK -- Russia plans to hire Norwegian divers this week to recover the bodies of 118 crewmen from the nuclear submarine Kursk, which sank last month, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said. Recovery work could start by Oct. 10, he said. But in a letter, 78 relatives of the crewmen urged the government to proceed slowly, lest the recovery work claim still more lives.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: KOHL LASHES OUT -- A tearful Helmut Kohl addressed a ceremony marking next week's 10th anniversary of German reunification, attacking Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer for ''betraying'' Germans by having given up on the move. Mr. Kohl, in a speech to a conservative research group, read out remarks made by the two men against reunification in the months before the Berlin Wall fell. Mr. Kohl, disgraced after a campaign fund scandal last year, has not been invited to speak at an official Unity Day event in Dresden on Oct. 3.</p>

        <p>GAZA STRIP: ATTACK INJURES SOLDIERS -- Two Israeli soldiers were wounded, one critically, in a roadside bomb attack against a convoy of Jewish settlers' cars they were escorting along a Gaza road, the army said. The army said the convoy was traveling to the Jewish settlement of Netzarim, in the southern Gaza Strip, which has been particularly tense since eight Palestinians were injured this week when their vehicle and an Israeli car collided.</p>

        <p>SYRIA: CALL FOR FREEDOM -- Syria's leading intellectuals demanded an end to martial rule in an expression of public discontent unseen in 30 years. Ninety-nine writers and artists signed a pamphlet published in Lebanese newspapers demanding an end to the state of emergency imposed in 1963, the immediate release of about 1,500 political prisoners, and freedom of assembly and expression, including a free press.</p>

        <p>CANADA: VOTE BEING CONSIDERED -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien is considering calling an election in November, a few days after the American election. Mr. Chretien, whose term expires in 2002, reportedly feels his chances of winning a third term were bolstered by an internal Liberal Party poll indicating that many Tory voters in Ontario are migrating to the Liberals, shunning the nation's new conservative party, the Canadian Alliance.</p>

        <p>CANADA: NEW SWITCH TO LIBERALS -- In the latest erosion of Canada's small parties, the Liberals gained another opposition member as Rick Laliberte, a New Democratic Party legislator from Saskatchewan, switched allegiance to the ruling party. This month two Tory Conservative legislators joined the Liberals. In Parliament the Conservatives have 15 seats, the New Democrats 19, the Bloc Quebecois 44, the Canadian Alliance 58, and the Liberals 160.</p>

A list of candidates will be published on Nov. 25 and results will be announced on Dec. 24, the paper said.

        <p>CHINA: FALUN GONG DEATHS -- Two members of the banned Falun Gong sect have died in custody, the latest deaths in a crackdown on the movement, a rights group reported. The deaths bring to at least 52 the number of Falun Gong followers who have died in detention, the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy said. While it has not commented on every case, the government has denied the deaths were the result of mistreatment.</p>
