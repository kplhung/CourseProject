        <p>Faced with a dwindling number of applicants for the city's Police Academy, the Police Department relaxed its eligibility requirements yesterday to allow younger recruits to join the department and to admit more officers without two years of college.</p>
        <p>Under the changes, which Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik said would take effect immediately, the department will accept 21-year-old applicants. For the last five years, the department set 22 as the minimum age, in the belief that officers younger than that were more likely to become disciplinary problems during their careers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik also said the department would waive a requirement that recruits have 60 college credits for two more categories of applicants. The department already waives the requirement for those with two or more years of honorable military service. Now it will be waived for any of the city's 5,200 traffic enforcement and school safety agents with least two years on the job.</p>
        <p>''This new initiative is a creative way to enlarge our pool of qualified applicants and attract city residents to a career in the N.Y.P.D.,'' Mr. Kerik said.</p>
        <p>The changes were the department's clearest acknowledgment yet of its struggle to find recruits for the 40,000-member force.</p>
        <p>In 1996, 31,000 people applied to take the department's admission test. In 1999, fewer than half that number applied, and this year the department has had to extend its application deadlines to find even several thousand people willing to take the test. Mr. Kerik said yesterday that the Oct. 6 deadline would be extended to Oct. 27 to allow more to apply. To date, slightly more than 2,000 people have applied, police officials said.</p>
        <p>Police and union officials have cited multiple problems in the department's effort to attract new members, including the strong private-sector economy and the relatively low starting pay -- roughly $31,500 -- for rookie officers, as well as the public outcry surrounding several fatal shootings by the police of unarmed black men.</p>
        <p>The problems have been severe enough to have become evident at the Police Academy. The next class of recruits, set to begin instruction tomorrow, is roughly 300 short of its 1,589 planned members, the first time in memory that the department has been unable to meet its budgeted class size.</p>
        <p>Given these problems, said Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, chairman of the City Council's Public Safety Committee, the changes made yesterday have merits. ''I think we may very well need to relax some rule or rules in order to get the numbers,'' he said. ''It's a trade-off, and something that is necessary.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who appeared at a news conference with Mr. Kerik to announce the changes, said the extension of the education waiver to school safety and traffic agents would not affect the quality of the applicants because these agents had been monitored during their years of city employment. Mr. Kerik said that by loosening the eligibility requirements for these employees, the department gains a pool of 1,300 potential applicants, many of whom are members of minority groups.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the changes run counter to some of the department's previous thinking, and certainly to its public posture to date. Since last year, when the drop in public interest in city police careers became apparent, the department had maintained it did not have a hiring problem, and said its stepped-up recruiting efforts, including two $10 million advertising campaigns, were aimed more at diversifying the ranks than maintaining the department's size.</p>
        <p>As recently as this spring, Commissioner Kerik's predecessor, Howard Safir, claimed recruiters had a waiting list of thousands of hopeful applicants.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's changes also went against the recommendation of a 1993 report by William J. O'Sullivan, then the chief of personnel, whose staff studied recruiting when the department was preparing to raise the minimum age to 22 from 20.</p>
        <p>The 1993 study looked at 338 officers who had been classified as ''problem officers'' because they had been suspended, placed on modified assignment or placed in some other disciplinary-based supervisory system. Seventeen percent of this group, or 58 officers, were 21 when they were hired, representing the single highest category of officers in the group, who were recruited between  ages 20 and 33.</p>
        <p>''Members of the service who are appointed at ages 20 and 21 are more likely to become disciplinary problems than those who are appointed at a later age,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leffler acknowledged this concern yesterday, but said the new eligibility requirements seemed a necessary compromise. ''There is somewhat more maturity between a 22-year-old and a 21-year-old, so I think it has some significance,'' he said. ''But we do have to hire more people. Something has to be done.''</p>
        <p>Police officials said that the new age limit was consistent with hiring practices in other cities and that they did not anticipate significant problems. ''Every other major police department in the country has an entrance age of 21,'' said Deputy Chief Thomas P. Fahey. ''We don't have a problem with this.''</p>
