        <p>The Metropolitan Opera's 1998 production of Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila'' returned to the house on Tuesday night, having already acquired the feel of a dusty and familiar old show.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that the producer, Elijah Moshinsky, and the set and costume designer, Richard Hudson, have not tried to capture the licentious and exotic aspects of this proudly conservative French composer's take on the Old Testament tale. The stage is filled with hanging scrims and sliding panels brush-stroked with lurid reds and oranges, like Abstract Expressionist paintings. Huge, spiky pinkish cones, weird-looking things, are meant to represent temples and palaces in ancient Gaza. And the Met must have sent audition notices to every gym and actors' studio in town to recruit the roster of muscled male extras who portray the Nubian slaves in loincloths.</p>

        <p>The Metropolitan Opera's 1998 production of Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila'' returned to the house on Tuesday night, having already acquired the feel of a dusty and familiar old show.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that the producer, Elijah Moshinsky, and the set and costume designer, Richard Hudson, have not tried to capture the licentious and exotic aspects of this proudly conservative French composer's take on the Old Testament tale. The stage is filled with hanging scrims and sliding panels brush-stroked with lurid reds and oranges, like Abstract Expressionist paintings. Huge, spiky pinkish cones, weird-looking things, are meant to represent temples and palaces in ancient Gaza. And the Met must have sent audition notices to every gym and actors' studio in town to recruit the roster of muscled male extras who portray the Nubian slaves in loincloths.</p>
        <p>But injecting vitality into this second-rate opera is a director's challenge. Despite a couple of disarming arias and some crowd-pleasing music in the bacchanalian dance scene, the score is mostly a tepid, awkward melodrama. For all their efforts, Mr. Moshinsky and Mr. Hudson manage only to put a theatrical gloss on an essentially inert work.</p>
        <p>Yet the opera contains two vocally juicy roles, and the Met has brought back two veterans from the production's premiere to sing them: the tenor Placido Domingo and the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves. Mr. Domingo, nearing 60, is singing better than opera buffs have any right to expect. He has to work more audibly than before to sustain his voice, and his softened legato passages sometimes have a leathery quality. But he seems to be responding to the understandable diminishing of his vocal resources with heightened intensity. The poignant timbre of his sound is unchanged, and his notes are fearlessly dispatched.</p>
        <p>Though it's hard to deepen Saint-Saens's one-dimensional characterization, Mr. Domingo tried his best to project Samson's crisis of realization: as he loses his physical strength and berates himself for so foolishly succumbing to Dalila's allure, he regains the faith that has grounded his life.</p>
        <p>Ms. Graves is surely one of the loveliest Dalilas ever, and the dusky richness and vibrancy of her voice were essentially present. But she seemed to be singing somewhat tentatively. There were dry patches in her phrasing, and notes not placed quite as she wanted them. Perhaps she was having a slightly off night; she should rebound fully later in the run.</p>
        <p>The supporting cast was strong. The robust-voiced Russian baritone Sergei Leiferkus was the menacing High Priest of Dagon; the German bass Rene Pape brought his stentorian voice to the role of the Old Hebrew. And the sturdy German bass-baritone Falk Struckmann portrayed the hectoring Philistine Abimelech.</p>
        <p>The admirable conductor Mark Elder tried to draw from the score every bit of delicacy and nuance to be found in it. The opening chorus for the oppressed Israelites is a pointlessly academic fugatto, but under Mr. Elder the orchestra and chorus certainly let you hear the intertwining lines clearly. And he brought dash and color to the bacchanalian scene. Though with all those scantily clad male and female dancers gyrating about the stage and simulating copulation, who was listening?</p>
