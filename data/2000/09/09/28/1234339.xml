        <p>Much has been made of the fringe benefits of working for a dot-com company -- the free cappuccino, the concierge services and the lucrative stock options.</p>
        <p>But, for one day last week, working the production line for a company that makes floor wax and carpet cleaner brought the perk of a lifetime.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 19, Charlie Butcher, 84, the chairman of the family-owned Butcher Company in Marlborough, Mass., handed out bonus checks to his 325 employees that totaled $18 million, a hefty chunk of his proceeds from selling the company the day before. ''Some of the folks are big, strong, strapping machine operators, and they just filled up with tears,'' said Paul P. McLaughlin, the company's president. ''They would just throw their arms around Charlie and give him a big hug.''</p>
        <p>Lynne Ouellette, 42, who has been an administrative assistant for more than 10 years, would not disclose her share, but she did say that the checks were weighted according to seniority and salary. She estimated that each worker received at least $1.50 for every hour worked over the years. The average works out to more than $55,000 each. ''Charlie really wanted to take care of the hourly folks and people who put in a lot of years,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The employees knew of the impending sale and had heard rumors that they might be receiving a bonus. Still, they had no hint of the size, which for some totaled more than a year's salary, until Mr. Butcher and his wife, Jane, flew out from their Colorado home to close the deal with Johnson Wax Professional and hand out the checks. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Patty Rutherford, 41, has worked on the production floor for 22 years, and has never had such a windfall. ''I was just shocked,'' she said. ''I went over and hugged him and his wife. I couldn't say anything, I was too nervous.''</p>
        <p>Luckily, her hand was steady enough to take the check to the car dealership the same day, where she bought the blue Jeep she had been eyeing. Her 15-year-old daughter now has the bedroom furniture she had been promised.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Butcher, this may be the biggest lump sum of bliss he has delivered in his career, but he said employee satisfaction had been a shrewd business strategy for many years.</p>
        <p>''When people are happy in their jobs, they are at least twice as productive,'' he said in a phone interview from his home in Colorado, explaining his belief in higher starting salaries, flexible workweeks and letting people change jobs if they are unhappy. That, he said, leads to fewer mistakes, better production and more money for everyone.</p>
        <p>He hopes that other businesses will follow his lead.</p>
        <p>''It's a wonderful, easygoing philosophy,'' he said. ''At the same time, I get the pleasure of being thought of as a neat guy.''</p>
        <p>About 130 employees are based in Marlborough, about 30 miles west of Boston, with the rest in plants in Compton, Calif., and Alsip, Ill.</p>
        <p>William Taylor, president of the Alsip division who has worked for the company for 15 years, said that Mr. Butcher would act as a unique cheerleader for the sales team.</p>
        <p>''He would tell them, 'I want you guys to make me money, because I'm going to give it right back to you,' '' he said. ''They would say, 'Yeah, yeah.' ''</p>
        <p>To their surprise, it was more than true.</p>
        <p>''It's a strange feeling,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''To me and to others, we felt like it was far more than we actually deserved.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Butcher's grandfather, Charles Butcher, an installer of parquet floors in many of Boston's grand homes, founded the company in 1880. His product was a paste wax called Boston Polish, which is still respected in Martha Stewart's circle. But when Charlie Butcher took over the company from his father and uncle in the 1950's, he turned it into a competitive player in the commercial cleaning business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Butcher retired as chief executive in the 1970's and moved to Colorado, although he frequently flew back for sales meetings and the company-wide parties, picnics and barbecues that Butcher is known for.</p>
        <p>His employees know him as unabashedly affectionate.</p>
        <p>''When he spoke to people on the phone, from executive level all the way down, he would end the conversation with 'I love you,' '' said Suzanne Smethurst, now in her 14th year with the finance department. ''We all grew to understand that it was a sincere and heartfelt remark.''</p>
        <p>Reluctantly, the chairman decided to sell the company this year, partly to free up money for the Lazy Eight Foundation, a charitable research organization he founded three years ago, and partly because he did not have the capital to make necessary changes in the company's infrastructure.</p>
        <p>He ruled out a stock offering.</p>
        <p>''I knew if I went public I wouldn't be able to give out $18 million,'' he said. ''Investors are very tight with their money. If investors understood how much good it does to have happy, loving and productive employees, they would agree with me.''</p>
        <p>When he told the employees of his intention to sell this summer, it sent ripples of anxiety through the tight-knit company.</p>
        <p>''I thought I wasn't going to have a job,'' Ms. Rutherford said. ''I didn't know who was going to buy us. It was kind of nerve-racking.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Butcher was, as usual, looking out ''for all the cars in the parking lot.'' Although he said other companies offered him more money, he chose to deal with the spinoff of S. C. Johnson &amp; Son Inc., another family-owned company with a 114-year history of its own.</p>
        <p>J. Gary Raley, the president for North American operations at Johnson Wax, based in Sturtevant, Wis., said the plan was to let the Butcher Company operate independently, with the same name and employees. As a welcome-to-the-family gesture, he has sent each worker a basket filled with Pledge, Glade and Windex products.</p>
        <p>Much of the unexpected gain is as good as spent, workers said, mentioning purchases like televisions, college trust funds, vinyl siding and long-overdue prescription eyeglasses.</p>
        <p>Even with the money, they said, parting with Charlie will be bittersweet.</p>
