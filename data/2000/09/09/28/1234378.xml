        <p>Correction of Data Shows Slightly Higher Inflation  The government said that a software error caused it to slightly underestimate inflation during the first eight months of the year. Revision of the data means somewhat higher payments for recipients of Social Security and other federal benefits.</p>
        <p>And while economists said that the error, one-tenth of a percentage point, was not large enough to significantly alter their view of the nation's economy, it was nonetheless in the direction of faster inflation. [Page C6.]</p>

        <p>Judge Favors Release of Tire Data  A federal judge ruled that the public should have access to extensive information on tire technology that Firestone had to turn over during a lawsuit over a fatal accident.

        <p>Air France Sues in Concorde Crash  Air France said that it had sued Continental Airlines because it believed a metal strip from a Continental DC-10 that fell onto a runway led to the crash of its Concorde jet in July. [A5.]</p>
        <p>Government Still Has Economic Role  George W. Bush has made government a campaign issue, arguing that as president he would continue to tame Washington.
