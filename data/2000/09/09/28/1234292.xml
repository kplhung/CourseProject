        <p>The game was over, and the aging man quickly made his way through the emptying stands and down to the floor until he finally reached his old friend at courtside.</p>
        <p>''Hello, Doug,'' Aleksandr Gomelsky said with a charming Russian accent.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Coach,'' Doug Collins replied, sounding like someone whose high school teacher had caught up with him as an adult.</p>
        <p>''Nice to see you. How've you been?'' Collins said.</p>
        <p>''O.K., O.K. We talk later, yes?'' Gomelsky said.</p>
        <p>Collins and Gomelsky are links to a different era of basketball, when meetings between teams from the United States and Russia meant so much more than sports. On Thursday night, the teams will meet in an Olympic quarterfinal, a game almost anyone can find a ticket to in Sydney proper. Collins and Gomelsky, employed as television commentators for their respective countries, agree that the Americans are simply too skilled and strong for the Russians to keep pace.</p>
        <p>''Not like the old days,'' Gomelsky said.</p>
        <p>Not like 1988, when Gomelsky coached what would be the last Olympic team from the Soviet Union to a gold medal in Seoul, South Korea, defusing the press of John Thompson's American college players, stunning the United States and doing his part to usher in a new, potent era in international basketball: the U.S. of N.B.A.</p>
        <p>And not like 1972, when Collins, a stringy-haired collegian, stepped to the foul line in the final seconds while Gomelsky, an exiled national coach, watched from home. The Soviets won a disputed 1-point victory over the United States in Munich after the final three seconds were replayed.</p>
        <p>''The other night at halftime, they showed '72 up on the arena screen,'' said Collins, the NBC analyst who hit two clutch free throws for the United States and, along with his teammates, refused the silver medal to protest the controversial ending. ''You're always going to feel it at Olympic time.</p>
        <p>''The time I'll feel it most is when they hand out the medals. And when the United States gets the gold and they play the national anthem -- the thought of being up there with your teammates and having that experience . . . you know, something we should have had was taken away from us. That's what gets me more than anything else.''</p>
        <p>Gomelsky, whose visa and job were revoked for losing a competition to Yugoslavia the previous year, did not attend the Munich Games. But he watched with pride as the Soviets, employing his system of screens and movement, finally stayed on the same court with the great American athletes. He is astounded at how wronged many Americans still feel over Munich.</p>
        <p>''American people say it is not the right competition because American boys don't take home a gold medal,'' he said. ''But history is not always fair. I won the world championship in 1959 in Chile. But my team got a disqualification because we didn't play against Formosa. I won every game in Chile, two times United States and two times Brazil. But history's champion is Brazil. Same in Munich with the United States. See, history is not always fair.''</p>
        <p>In Russia, they call Gomelsky the Silver Fox. Whether the nickname pertains to Gomelsky's personal or professional life is up for conjecture. He turned 72 this year. Yet Gomelsky's fourth son -- his oldest is 46 -- turns 3 years old in November.</p>
        <p>''My wife is 33 now,'' he said. Second wife? ''No, No. 3. Every 20 years, I change women.''</p>
        <p>Gomelsky, who lived in San Diego for a time in the 1990's, is now president of Central Army, the Moscow basketball club that routinely wins the Russian championship. His brother, Yevgeny, coaches the Russian women's team. Gomelsky has attended 10 Olympics, beginning as an assistant with the Russian team in Melbourne in 1956.</p>
        <p>''I remember the '56 team,'' he said. ''Much better than this team. Bill Russell. K. C. Jones. Great, great players.</p>
        <p>''You want my opinion on this United States team?'' Gomelsky asked, unsolicited. ''In my opinion, the first Dream Team and the second Dream Team were much better than this team. Because not only were they great names and great people, but all the players on Dream Team No. 1 were together -- with Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Jordan. Fantastic players. These are good players, but not great. Regular players. But for this competition, there is not much interest in your team. Because your team is much better. Your team will win, but not by a big score.''</p>
        <p>Gomelsky's old team is spread among several former Soviet states today; the Eastern European threat to United States supremacy faded quicker than Arvydas Sabonis's vertical leap.</p>
        <p>Collins said he plans to catch up with Gomelsky. They rarely talk about Munich. ''But when we do, he has always been very kind to me about stepping up and making the free throws,'' Collins said.</p>
        <p>''He is truly a legendary figure in the game,'' he added. Collins said that Gomelsky was one of the first international coaches to use American methods ''to teach the Russian players the fundamentals and to get the pro offenses and the college offenses the United States were using.''</p>
        <p>Gomelsky had already gone by the time Collins had finished talking. He was off looking for another former United States Olympic player with a wealth of basketball knowledge.</p>
        <p>''Larry Brown, he is a very, very good friend,'' Gomelsky said of the United States assistant coach. ''I must talk to him, too.''</p>
        <p>Twenty-eight years after Munich, 12 years after Seoul, the Silver Fox is still at work.</p>
