        <p>After years of stockpiling biological evidence from unsolved rape cases, the city is sending the evidence to private laboratories to try to identify the rapists through any DNA they left behind.</p>
        <p>The evidence, called rape kits, is the result of standardized medical examinations done at hospitals on each rape victim. The kits have long been stored in Police Department freezers in a Queens warehouse. Each kit includes vaginal and oral swabs, the victim's underwear, and sometimes hair, skin, blood and semen or saliva.</p>
        <p>Current technology allows forensic scientists to replicate the DNA from the smallest bits of this evidence and then lift a distinct genetic code that can almost flawlessly identify the person from whom the biological matter came. The police and prosecutors can then compare the genetic code with that of DNA taken from criminals and stored in city, state and federal databases.</p>
        <p>Since January 1999, all new rape kits, as well as biological evidence from homicide investigations, have been analyzed for DNA by the city's medical examiner's office, which has been able to solve cold cases and to  link multiple, unsolved sex attacks to individual rapists. But the overwhelming number of kits from before 1999 have never been tested.</p>
        <p>In all, the department has 16,000 old rape kits in storage. Under a plan announced yesterday by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Police Commissioner Bernard B. Kerik, the city will spend $12 million over the next three years to have private laboratories test 12,000 of the most recent kits. If the testing proves successful, the other 4,000 kits will be tested later, city officials said.</p>
        <p>''Far too often in this city's history we have been plagued by pattern rapists,'' said Robert Johnson, the Bronx district attorney.</p>
        <p>How many of the cases would be prosecutable remained unclear yesterday. New York's rape law has a five-year statute of limitations, meaning many of the backlogged kits are for cases that have already expired, and more of the cases are expiring each month.</p>
        <p>City officials used the news conference yesterday to call on the State Legislature to repeal the statute of limitations. Last spring, a bill eliminating the statute of limitations for rape and several other felonies was prepared by Gov. George E. Pataki, but did not pass the Legislature. Mr. Pataki plans to push the issue again next year.</p>
