        <p>The Mets are not the best team now, but they remember when they were. Their commemorative caps are not as brash, but they were still soaked in Champagne. The Mets missed their first goal, the National League East championship, but will be in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>That was assured last night when the Mets captured the N.L. wild card with a 6-2 victory over their nemeses, the Atlanta Braves. October became a reality, and the soggy clubhouse at Shea Stadium was filled with possibility.</p>
        <p>''I think every team in the playoffs in this league has, at one time, been the best team in the league,'' said catcher Mike Piazza. ''The team that's able to recapture that form is the one that's going to win. That's the bottom line.''</p>
        <p>Last night, the bottom line was this: The Mets are in at last, and they have reached the postseason two years in a row for the first time in their 40-year history. They decided their own fate, just as they wanted to do, and they will open the division series on the road next Wednesday. The San Francisco Giants or the St. Louis Cardinals, whichever team has the better record, will be at home for Game 1.</p>
        <p>The Mets (90-68) started September with the best record in the National League, but they have slumped this month, winning only 11 of 25 games. There was a players-only meeting, a fiery speech from their manager and a prolonged slump by Piazza, their best player.</p>
        <p>But the Mets doused each other with bubbly last night, and their ranking veteran said they never had a doubt.</p>
        <p>''We knew sooner or later we were going to celebrate,'' said reliever John Franco, who stayed with the club this season in hopes of returning to the playoffs. ''It was just a matter of when and where. The main thing was to make sure we got in, first. We didn't want to depend on other teams like we did last year, when Milwaukee did us a favor. We didn't want to watch tonight and see what the Dodgers are doing. We wanted to take care of it ourselves.''</p>
        <p>The Mets eliminated Los Angeles, their closest wild-card challenger, behind eight strong innings from Rick Reed, who improved to 11-5. The Mets are 20-9 in Reed's starts, and he has made a habit of winning big games. He kept the Mets alive with a shutout in the final weekend last year, and the Mets won both his starts in the postseason.</p>
        <p>''It's just a regular game to me,'' Reed said, though Braves Manager Bobby Cox made a bigger fuss over him. The Mets have won only five of 12 games from Atlanta, and Reed has two of the victories.</p>
        <p>''I think he's one of the best pitchers in the league,'' Cox said. ''He always has been. He's tough. He throws a lot of strikes and he's got zip on the ball.''</p>
        <p>Despite working without a reliable breaking ball, Reed allowed only one run, a home run by Andruw Jones in the first inning. The Braves' starter, Kevin Millwood, set the Mets down in order for the first three innings, continuing his career-long mastery of a Mets lineup that was hitting .171 off him going in.</p>
        <p>But Timo Perez, a rookie who almost certainly will make the postseason roster, sparked the game-tying rally with a single to lead off the fourth. He came home on a bases-loaded walk to Todd Zeile, and started things off in the fifth with a two-out triple into the right field corner.</p>
        <p>Darryl Hamilton singled home Perez to put the Mets in front, 2-1, and Edgardo Alfonzo homered on the next pitch to widen the lead to 4-1. The 48,858 fans started to rock the stadium, and they stood in appreciation when Armando Benitez struck out Keith Lockhart for the final out.</p>
        <p>The Mets exchanged hugs and smiles up and down the infield handshake line, saving their real party for their clubhouse, which was draped in plastic to avoid Champagne damage. While Manager Bobby Valentine gave a television interview, General Manager Steve Phillips emptied a bottle over his head. ''Thanks, Boss,'' Valentine said, wiping his eyes.</p>
        <p>Phillips was not the only boss who checked in with Valentine. As he waited on the line for the co-owner Fred Wilpon's congratulatory phone call, Valentine made a playful reference to his unsettled contract status.</p>
        <p>''Yes, Fred, sure, gladly -- how many?'' Valentine said, pretending he had just been offered a multiyear contract. ''Oh, he's not there yet.''</p>
        <p>Wilpon is waiting until after the season to discuss Valentine's status, but Valentine knew he needed to direct his team to the playoffs to return. When Wilpon's call connected, Valentine was gracious, thanking Wilpon for his support. ''We're going to get them,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Valentine sounded relieved to have made the postseason; he is eager to meet with his coaches and Phillips to discuss the playoff roster, the pitching rotation and how much rest players need in the final four regular-season games. He dismissed the suggestion that a slow September has given the Mets insufficient momentum for the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''This team is made up of a fabulous group of individuals who are strong and talented,'' Valentine said. ''They proved to me, time and time again, how good they are. I'll take my chances, I guarantee that, against anyone.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Right fielder DEREK BELL said he expected to sit out the next two games to rest his left knee and left shin, which he bruised after a fine running catch of a fly ball by ANDRUW JONES in the fifth inning last night. Bell, who caught the ball as he banged into the fence on a sprint, first injured the knee on Aug. 29 and has missed seven games because of it since then. . . . Shortstop REY ORDONEZ met with a doctor and will have the metal plate removed from his left forearm today. Ordonez, out since Memorial Day with a broken arm, played catch yesterday and will resume workouts in six weeks. . . . Left fielder BENNY AGBAYANI still has discomfort in his right hamstring when he finishes his swing, but he expects to take batting practice today for the first time since Friday. . . . The co-owner NELSON DOUBLEDAY told The Associated Press last night that it might make better sense financially for the Mets to refurbish Shea Stadium instead of proceeding with plans for a new ballpark in the Shea parking lot.</p>
