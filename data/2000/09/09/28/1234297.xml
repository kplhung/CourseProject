        <p>Fifteen years ago J. Paul Getty 2nd gave the National Gallery in London a $62.5 million grant, the largest since its founding in 1824. That any individual, let alone an American, would give so generously to a British museum was unheard of. In those years few rich Britons ever wrote a substantial check to a cultural institution. They didn't have to; the government provided ample support. Besides, for British citizens, giving never had the tax advantages that it does in the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Getty, an Anglophile whose father was the founder of the Getty oil fortune and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, lives in England. His donation did not go unnoticed; in 1986 he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, Sir Paul, who has since become a British citizen, could be considered something of a pioneer. Today, as London is seeing the greatest cultural expansion in its history -- a $600 million millennium effort financed partly by England's national lottery and partly by private donations -- a list of many of the largest donors reads like a Who's Who of American philanthropy. New galleries, courtyards, libraries, reading rooms and additions are being christened with names like Annenberg and Sackler.</p>
        <p>And though few American donors are likely to receive honorary knighthoods, there are other perquisites. It costs far less to make a splash in London than in New York, where a $15 million check won't necessarily extract an invitation to join a board. And, of course, there's always the possibility of hobnobbing with titled folk and royals.</p>
        <p>Well-known Americans who have written big checks include Maria-Theresa Heinz, the widow of Senator John Heinz III; Jayne Wrightsman, one of the Metropolitan Museum's most generous trustees; Cynthia Polsky, another Met trustee; Jonathan H. Kagan, a managing director of Lazard Freres; and Raymond Sackler, the psychiatrist and collector. Each has given support to places like the National Portrait Gallery, the Royal Academy, the British Museum and Somerset House.</p>
        <p>American money accounted for nearly 30 percent of all the individual financing for the $214 million Tate Modern in London, the first new national museum in Britain in 100 years and its first devoted solely to modern art. The donors' wall includes the names of some of America's best-known contemporary art collectors -- Donald Fisher, founder of the Gap; Charles Schwab, the investment magnate; Donald L. Bryant, the St. Louis collector; Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler.</p>
        <p>American corporations, too, have been generous. Bloomberg News, whose founder, Michael R. Bloomberg, is a trustee of the Met, gave the Tate Modern more than $1.5 million for a series of reading rooms and for three audio guides.</p>
        <p>And depending on how the donations to British institutions are made, they can be tax-deductible in the United States..</p>
        <p>''We see ourselves as the 51st state in the union,'' said Colin Tweedy, chief executive of Art and Business, a nonprofit organization in England that promotes business investments in the arts. ''The American government is effectively paying for many projects here.''</p>
        <p>The reason for the phenomenon, Mr. Tweedy added, is simply that ''Americans understand how to give, what to give and how to get something out of it.''</p>
        <p>Henry Christensen III, a Manhattan lawyer who is a trustee of the American Fund for the Tate, has noticed that ''the idea of U.S. fund-raising for foreign charities is more and more au courant.''</p>
        <p>One important factor has been the formation by British art institutions of American fund-raising arms that have tax-exempt status in the United States. Based in New York, these ''friends'' groups are independent charitable organizations with boards of directors that decide how to spend the money. An American donor can write a check to one of these groups and take the same tax deduction that writing a check to the Met or the Modern brings.</p>
        <p>It isn't just tax benefits that prompt Americans to support English institutions. A small check in London goes a lot further than in New York or Los Angeles and generally gets the donor's name on the right party lists.</p>
        <p>Some donors are simply Anglophiles who enjoy the cachet that comes with supporting a London arts group; others, like the scores of American investment bankers who have been transferred to London and have been living there for several years now, consider England a second home. And for serious collectors who give, there is instant access to some of the world's leading scholars and curators as well as weekend excursions featuring tours given by experts through some of Europe's greatest private art collections and parties organized by the British museums.</p>
        <p>''These institutions sort of belong to the world; they're global,'' said Jill Sackler. She and her late husband, Arthur, were the principal donors of a wing named after them at the Royal Academy. Mrs. Sackler recalled that as the international chairwoman of the Edinburgh Festival in the 1980's she met Sir Hugh Casson, who was then president of the Royal Academy. Sir Hugh, who died last year, invited the Sacklers for a tour of the academy, and a long relationship was born.</p>
        <p>Douglas Cramer, a television and theatrical producer who has given not only money but also artworks to the Tate Modern, said that Anglophilia was the main reason for his generosity. But he added: ''When I first went to London, the Tate was the one place I would go to see exhibitions. The other museums seemed so excessively stuffy.''</p>
        <p>In 1997, when Mr. Cramer moved from Los Angeles to New York and sold or gave away much of an art collection that belonged in part to him and in part to a foundation he established, he asked some of the artists whose work he planned to donate where they wanted it to go to. ''Roy and Dorothy Lichtenstein wanted an interior painting of Roy's to go to the Tate because the Modern already had a comparable one,'' he said. ''The Modern already had an early Richard Serra which was similar to one I also gave the Tate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cramer recalled that during the years the museum was under construction, ''there wasn't a collector who cared who didn't get a personal tour.''</p>
        <p>''We all felt a part of it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That feeling has been carefully nurtured by the museum. Jacob Rothschild, a philanthropist and the former chairman of the lottery fund, said that clever marketing was one reason for the Tate Modern's success. ''The Tate has projected itself as a very non-British institution but a totally international one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Serota, the director, said he had been getting a lot of American gifts, ranging from $750,000 to $2 million. ''Major collectors of 1980's and 90's art come here to see shows,'' he said. ''For someone who's used to giving $5 million to their local museum, to give $1 million to the Tate isn't that much, and it gives them a foothold in Europe. They enjoy being here, and relatively small sums make a huge difference.''</p>
        <p>Even the families of American artists want to be included in the Tate Modern. Candida and Rebecca Smith, the daughters of the American sculptor David Smith, sold ''Wagon 2,'' one of their father's works, to the American Fund for the Tate, which gave it to the new museum.</p>
        <p>Marketing has become important to all of London's arts institutions, since government financing has become scarcer and lottery money often has to be matched by private donations.</p>
        <p>''Americans invented fund-raising, and we're running to catch up,'' said Sukie Hemming, director of the British Museum Development Trust. ''For so long, old money has been cash-light because it is all tied up in land. Giving has never come from the aristocracy.''</p>
        <p>That, Ms. Hemming said, has a lot to do with what she calls ''the English mentality.''</p>
        <p>''We don't grow up in the U.K. understanding ambition,'' she said. ''We find it unsettling, whereas in the States it's endemic. To have ambition and make money in America is applauded, and part of establishing wealth is giving it away. That's changing here. The dot-coms have helped. But it's slow.''</p>
        <p>Sue Devine, director of the British Museum's six-year-old American Friends office in New York, said that the museum's world-class collections were her best sales tool. ''Our focus is educational,'' she said. ''Collectors can use our curators and have great access to them. We're a storehouse of information and knowledge.''</p>
        <p>Each institution has its own friends office, and each has a sales pitch tailored to the institution.</p>
        <p>''In the end there has to be something for Americans in it,'' said Danny Khosrovani, president of the American Friends of the Royal Court Theater, which reopened in March after a $42 million renovation.</p>
        <p>Much of the money that Ms. Khosrovani has raised -- upwards of $250,000 -- has gone into supporting American playwrights who have had difficulty getting their plays produced in the United States. Last year alone, seven Royal Court productions could be seen either on or off Broadway. ''We help American voices in the theater,'' she said. Playwrights like Rebecca Gilman, whose play ''Spinning Into Butter'' closed at Lincoln Center last week, got her start at the Royal Court.</p>
        <p>The Royal Academy of Art was the first London art institution to set up an American office. That was in 1983, and over the years it has received gifts and pledges for about $30 million. When Paul Mellon, the Washington philanthropist, died last year, he bequeathed the academy $5 million. Unlike the British Museum or the Tate, the Royal Academy gets no government subsidy. Nor is it a museum.</p>
        <p>''We were set up in 1768 by artists to be the first professional association of artists,'' said John Nickson, director of the Royal Academy Trust. ''Our links to the United States are strong; they go back to the 18th century and have continued.''</p>
        <p>In fact, one of the founding members was the American painter Benjamin West, who became the academy's second president. The institution is in the final phase of the renovation of Burlington House, its home on Piccadilly. The American associates expect to raise about a third of the $30 million cost.</p>
        <p>''Our donors are Anglophiles who are sophisticated enough to see the art world as global,'' said Kathrine Ockenden, president and executive director of the American Associates of the Royal Academy Trust. ''Since we don't get government help, we run the ship ourselves, which is something Americans admire and understand.''</p>
        <p>The academy organizes many symposiums and other events that bring Americans to London. And sometimes it has organized exhibitions that come to American museums, like ''Sensation: Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection,'' the controversial show that opened at the Brooklyn Museum of Art last fall. Others include ''1900: Art at the Crossroads,'' which was at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum earlier this month; ''Chardin,'' which was at the Met recently; and ''Art in the Age of Queen Victoria,'' which ended a five-city American tour this week at the Cincinnati Art Museum.</p>
        <p>Smaller London institutions, too, like the National Portrait Gallery and the Dulwich Picture Gallery, rely heavily on American support. ''The roll call of British patrons could be counted on less than one hand,'' said Desmond Shore-Taylor, director of the Dulwich. ''It's in the American mind-set that rich people support the arts.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 29, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about American philanthropists' donations to British art institutions misstated the surname of the director of the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London. He is Desmond Shawe-Taylor, not Shore-Taylor.</p>
