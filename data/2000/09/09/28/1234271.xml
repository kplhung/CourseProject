        <p>The teacups clinked daintily as the ladies of the Lithgow Valley Lawn Bowling Club sat down to lunch. But the talk was of male Olympic swimmers and their rippling muscles.</p>
        <p>''That Lenny Krayzelburg,'' said Beryl Hammonds, clutching her heart in a mock swoon as she referred to the American backstroker who won three gold medals. ''There's nothing wrong with him that I can see.''</p>
        <p>Linda Kirkland and Ruth Harries nodded vigorously today as they recalled their own long nights in front of the television. The women cooked 15 dinners before the Games started, so they would not miss a minute of the coverage. They watch at home so they can toast every medalist, no matter the nationality.</p>
        <p>''We get nice and drunk because all we have to do is fall into bed at the end of the night,'' Harries said with a titter.</p>
        <p>Lithgow, population 15,000, lies at the end of the electrified railroad line 90 miles west of Sydney, on the slopes of the Blue Mountains. It is not the sort of place the writer Donald Horne was thinking of when he famously described Australia as ''the lucky country'' four decades ago.</p>
        <p>Remote, economically depressed, and cursed with lousy weather, Lithgow is worlds away from the designer skyscrapers and sun-splashed beaches of Sydney. A few cars rattled along Main Street, barely outracing the fog that scudded down from the nearby mountains.</p>
        <p>And yet, for all its hard-luck veneer, Lithgow is as proud, as captivated, and as unabashedly excited about the Olympics as Sydney. At a time when its factories are shutting down and its young people are fleeing for better opportunities elsewhere, the Games have given Lithgow's residents -- coal miners, train engineers and prison guards -- something to cheer about.</p>
        <p>There are hundreds of towns like Lithgow speckled across the endless Australian hinterland. Left out of the economic boom that has transformed Australia, and neglected by politicians who live on the coast, these towns are nevertheless rejoicing in the success of the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>''I think we've shown that for a small country, we can put on a great show,'' said Don Green, a driver for the state roads and traffic authority. ''That's what has made a lot of Australians very proud.''</p>
        <p>Green, who was nursing a pint at the Grand Central pub, noted that Lithgow had a distinguished Olympic tradition. Marjorie Jackson, a runner who won two gold medals at the Helsinki Games in 1952, came from here. Last month, the Lithgow Flash, as Jackson is called, returned to her hometown to carry the Olympic torch when it passed through on its way to Sydney.</p>
        <p>''I played net ball against Marjorie Jackson in school,'' Kirkland said at the lawn bowling lunch. And Barbara Bryce chimed in, ''I lived next door to her.'' Everybody had a Marjorie Jackson story.</p>
        <p>Only slightly less exalted is John Doyle, a local comedian who under the stage name Roy Slaven is the co-host of ''The Dream,'' a wildly popular late-night show that follows the Olympics on Australia's Seven Network.</p>
        <p>Slaven and his partner, H. G. Nelson, take gleeful jabs at everything from New Zealand to the grandees of the International Olympic Committee. And Slaven draws heavily, if not altogether factually, from his childhood here.</p>
        <p>A drive through Lithgow explains why the Olympics have lifted this place in a way, perhaps, that it would not lift an Appalachian mining town. Beyond Main Street, and the stony ruins of a 19th-century steel mill that gave the town its start, lie verdant playing fields and sports facilities.</p>
        <p>For a town with few resources, Lithgow has spent a fortune on sports. It has a heated Olympic swimming pool, a new basketball stadium, a running track, tennis courts, cricket grounds and hockey fields that Len Ashworth, the editor of the local paper, says cost the town's taxpayers nearly $1 million.</p>
        <p>Sports is how Lithgow has coped with being on the short end of one economic cycle after the other. First the steel mill closed, then the coal mines cut back. The small-arms factory that makes machine guns was downsized after the Australian army began importing them from overseas. And, in the most recent setback, a brasserie factory shifted its operations to Indonesia.</p>
        <p>''When people get laid off around here, they take up another sport; it's better than moping at home,'' said Annette Geddes, who works at the Lithgow Workmens Club, where the members play competitive snooker.</p>
        <p>Some people take a more cynical view of Lithgow's jock culture.</p>
        <p>''What else is there to do?'' asked Paul Nichols, a barber, as he lounged in his shop, watching a field hockey match on television.</p>
        <p>Lithgow's addiction to sports does not mean it has escaped the more normal addictions of a town in tough times. Drug abuse is a problem and the town's seven pubs -- or hotels, as they are called in Australia -- fill up each day with locals who come to drink their lunches and dinners.</p>
        <p>''If beer drinking were an Olympic sport, we'd represent all of Australia,'' said Nichols, 24, whose hair is dyed white.</p>
        <p>Nor do people here have any illusions about whether the Olympics will help them. The Australian government forecast is that the Games will attract 1.5 million more tourists to the country than usual between 1998 and 2002. But with few attractions aside from the rugged Blue Mountains, most will not make it this far.</p>
        <p>''Let's be honest, Sydney is going to get all the benefits,'' said Robin Clark, a laborer who has been unemployed since he hurt his shoulder a year ago. ''It's going to help Australia, but not all of Australia.''</p>
        <p>Clark spends his days hunkered over a snooker table at the Workmens Club. He thinks Lithgow's future depends on attracting new industries. A silicon manufacturer and a fireworks maker recently set up shop here, while a consortium of companies has talked about building a vast aluminum smelting plant. That would create 1,000 jobs and could transform Lithgow's economy.</p>
        <p>''Something has got to happen soon, because a lot of people have been laid off,'' Clark said, his voice briefly rising above a monotone.</p>
        <p>Many of the unemployed wind up at the local off-track betting parlor, where a bank of televisions was showing the field hockey match and a harness race. Betting on the Games is not allowed in the province of New South Wales, so the few wagerers ignored the hockey to focus on the ponies.</p>
        <p>Helen Campbell, who runs the parlor, said business had fallen by 10 percent to 20 percent since the Games started. Even the hard-core gamblers, she said, seemed to be taking a rest to watch the Olympics on television. The traffic was equally thin next door, at the Bracey department store.</p>
        <p>Whatever their personal struggles, people here have set them aside for two weeks to savor Australia's moment in the sun. Green, of the roads and traffic authority, chalked it up to the Australian spirit.</p>
        <p>''We've had droughts and fires and downturns in this town, but it doesn't break our spirit,'' he said as his mates ordered another round and settled in for another evening of Olympic enjoyment. ''We just keep going.''</p>
