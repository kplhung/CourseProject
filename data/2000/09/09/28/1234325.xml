        <p>Benjamin Netanyahu was among a crowd of oblivious techies here today, trying his best to pitch the merits of an Israeli telecommunications company while being repeatedly interrupted by calls on his cellular telephone.</p>
        <p>''Sorry, story's breaking,'' he said with a satisfied grin. ''It's a nice story to break.''</p>
        <p>He was all smiles, dressed in a dark suit and checkered tie. But Mr. Netanyahu, who was at a technology convention here this week to generate press for Telco Systems, spilled no news himself.</p>
        <p>Instead, he remained strategically mum about his exoneration. Asked how he felt about the Israeli attorney general's decision not to prosecute him after a yearlong investigation, Mr. Netanyahu would say only, ''relieved, relieved, relieved.''</p>
        <p>''I was called in for interrogation, the public investigation began one day after Rosh Hashanah,'' he added. ''It was formally closed a day before Rosh Hashanah.'' The formal decision by the Israeli attorney general was to be announced Thursday, and Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, begins Friday evening.</p>
        <p>Sitting inside a conference room at CNN headquarters here, Mr. Netanyahu declined even to say who he was on the phone with. ''Just people from Israel,'' is all he would offer.</p>
        <p>He declined to reflect on the impact of the latest developments on the Likud Party, or its Labor opponents. And he remained teasingly reticent about whether he plans to return to politics, insisting that he wished to speak to his family and his lawyers first.</p>
        <p>Mr. Netanyahu had been scheduled to speak with a stream of reporters, most of them covering technology, later in the day. But he canceled those plans, took a private plane to Ann Arbor, where he was to give a talk at the University of Michigan, and then was to catch an El Al flight from New York to Israel tonight.</p>
        <p>''I'd really like to talk about it once I go there,'' Mr. Netanyahu said of his potential political plans. ''I'd like to be there in Israel to respond.''</p>
        <p>Besides, he insisted, he hadn't even seen the text of the report, only had its highlights read to him over the phone.</p>
        <p>By whom?</p>
        <p>A smile and a shrug.</p>
        <p>Yet if the former prime minister revealed nothing of his plans, his current boss, Zvi Marom, chief executive officer of Telco's parent company, BATM Advanced Communications, did, predicting that Mr. Netanyahu would likely return to politics.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Netanyahu demurred on questions about his political opponent, Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Mr. Marom repeatedly lashed out on his behalf. ''When a witch hunt happens and you don't get a witch, you have yourself a martyr,'' he added. ''He will be forced into politics. His popularity is very high.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Netanyahu was at the Telco Systems booth in the sub-basement of the convention center this morning at 11 when news came over his cell phone. Mr. Marom said he watched his face relax. ''He looked at me. I looked at him and we knew.''</p>
