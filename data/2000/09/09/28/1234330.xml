        <p>Even in their worst moments, Brazilians had their prowess in soccer to sustain them, as celebrated in four World Cups. But the passion has suddenly become a sorry symbol, with the coach of the World Cup team accused of corruption and several star players under investigation for tax evasion.</p>
        <p>As a result, the nation is suffering  a crisis of identity and its team is in disarray.</p>
        <p>After having lost only one qualifying match in the entire 70-year history of the World Cup, the Brazilian squad has lost to Paraguay 2-1 and to Chile 3-0 and tied with Colombia and Uruguay, results regarded here as shameful.</p>
        <p>''Have we sunk to the point of being humiliated by Paraguayans and Chileans?'' the columnist Arthur Dapieve asked recently in the daily O Globo.</p>
        <p>The defeats have ''revived our national inferiority complex,'' he added, since soccer and music are the two reasons ''for us Brazilians to be proud and look down on the rest of humanity from above.''</p>
        <p>But the trials of the playing field are hardly the only reason that Brazilians are calling for the head of Wanderley Luxemburgo da Silva, coach of the national team. His former secretary, Renata Moura Alves, says that Mr. Luxemburgo was involved in a series of illegal schemes,  from clandestine payments from the sale of player contracts to money laundering and the purchase of apartments, paintings and luxury automobiles through dummy companies to avoid taxes.</p>
        <p>Federal tax authorities say that they are hot on Mr. Luxemburgo's trail and that he may owe as much as $1 million in back taxes and penalties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luxemburgo himself has said ''the problem is being resolved'' and has vowed that ''the course of the case will not affect the exercise of my profession.''</p>
        <p>The impact of all this on the national psyche is hard to overestimate. As the newsmagazine Epoca noted recently, ''Here in the land of soccer, the post of coach of the national team can be just as prestigious as that of president of the republic.''</p>
        <p>During the most repressive period of the 21-year dictatorship that ended in 1985, the coach at the time, Joao Saldanha, was one of the few people who dared publicly to defy the military. Before the 1970 World Cup, when Gen. Emilio Medici pressed Mr. Saldanhato to choose certain players that were favorites of his, the coach replied, ''I promise not to tell him how to run the country if he promises not to tell me how to run the team.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Luxemburgo's case, even his age is now in doubt. He says he is  45, but documents recently uncovered by news organizations here show his real age to be 48. The age differential is important because it indicates that as a young man Mr. Luxemburgo was still playing juvenile-level soccer when he should have been playing as an adult. That is a violation of both Brazilian and international rules because it is unfair competition and if detected can result in fines or suspension of a player or an entire team.</p>
        <p>The Federal Police planned to question Mr. Luxemburgo about possible perjury after his return from Sydney, where he was coaching an Olympic squad that is younger and less experienced than the World Cup team. [Brazil's Olympic team was eliminated on Sept. 23 after upset losses to South Africa, 3-1, and to Cameroon, 2-1 in overtime.]</p>
        <p>For the average fan, the most serious of the accusations is that Mr. Luxemburgo may have named some players to the national team in return for payments from their agents. Because of the prestige of being on the squad, the market value of such players would soar, and they would be able to command higher transfer fees when later sold to European teams, with a percentage of the money allegedly going to Mr. Luxemburgo.</p>
        <p>The director of the Brazilian Soccer Federation, Ricardo Teixeira, has said that action will be taken against Mr. Luxemburgo only if it can be proved he was involved in the purchase and sale of players.</p>
        <p>But some commentators maintain there is only one plausible explanation for some of the quirky player choices he has made. One cartoon shows Mr. Luxemburgo with those questionable picks and has him asking, ''You didn't think I was doing this for free, did you?''</p>
        <p>Eurico Miranda, a director of the Vasco da Gama soccer team here, noted recently: ''Evanilson was a name that nobody even knew how to pronounce. Nonetheless, he was picked for the national team and soon afterward was sold to a German team'' for a reported $7 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luxemburgo has said that all the accusations against him not related to the tax case are false and are intended to get him fired. Before heading off for the Olympics, where Brazil has never won the gold medal in soccer, he appeared on a popular television program to plead with the public to ''let me do my job'' and to proclaim his innocence.</p>
        <p>''When this is all over, they're going to say it was all a lot of nonsense, and it will be understood that nobody proved anything against me because there was nothing to be proved,'' he said. ''They're treating me like I'm a crook, but I'm not a crook.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Luxemburgo has also been fighting with some of the team's most popular players, including the star striker Romario, hero of Brazil's 1994 World Cup victory and now in line to become the second leading scorer in team history, after Pele.</p>
        <p>''Those who are no good need no help in destroying themselves,'' Romario said recently after the coach left him off the Olympic squad.</p>
        <p>Yet Romario himself, along with Ronaldinho, Roberto Carlos and at least four other members of the World Cup team, is also being investigated for possible tax evasion, federal authorities have said. That is a surprising new attitude, the humorist Luis Fernando Verissimo wrote recently, in a country where soccer and those who play it have long enjoyed ''a sweet irresponsibility, without obligations and without punishment.''</p>
        <p>After the Brazilian team won the 1994 World Cup in the United States, for example, players, coaches and executives brought back several tons of household and electronic appliances, computers and other luxury goods. When they landed and customs officials demanded they pay duty, they threatened to boycott the official celebrations, and top government officials were forced to intervene to get the customs department to relent.</p>
        <p>''It is healthy, therefore, that the soccer business is finally being seriously investigated and that adult behavior is being demanded,'' Mr. Verissimo wrote. For too long, he added, players and management alike ''have counted on the tender tolerance given to children playing at being grown-ups.''</p>
