        <p>If NBC's Bob Costas wants to call a baseball game on broadcast television during the next six seasons, he will have to ring up Fox Sports.</p>
        <p>NBC's rejection on Tuesday of Major League Baseball's demand to renew the contract it has had since 1996 allowed Fox to swoop in with a $2.5 billion contract to merge its package with NBC's.</p>
        <p>''When we started Fox Sports, we said: 'Where should we go? Which sports did we want?' '' said David Hill, the chairman of the Fox Television Sports Group. ''We wanted and got the National Football League, we wanted Nascar and we wanted baseball. And we said, 'Wouldn't it be great to have the World Series year in and year out?' ''</p>
        <p>Starting next year, that is what Fox will get. In addition to six guaranteed years of the World Series, it will retain the Saturday Game of the Week, carry every All-Star Game through 2006, and every league championship series and division series. The division series games will most likely be shown on cable on Fox Sports Net.</p>
        <p>Negotiations have taken place over several months, with baseball initially wanting to triple what Fox and NBC were paying to renew their deals. Both rejected the demands, as did ESPN, which was paying about $43 million a year to carry division series games. ABC and CBS passed on assuming NBC's package, which had only been for the postseason and three All-Star Games. Fox made its offer to baseball nearly three weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Fox's $417 million annual rights fee under its new deal represents a 44 percent jump over the $290 million paid for the same group of packages by Fox, NBC and ESPN since 1996.</p>
        <p>''It was the best deal baseball could make,'' said Neal Pilson, an industry consultant and former president of CBS Sports.</p>
        <p>''Baseball didn't have the leverage or competitive market going for it. They asked for a tripling and got less than 50 percent. This is the market. You get what the market says you're worth, not what you say you're worth.''</p>
        <p>Fox is assuming the largest load of sports network rights since CBS owned a similar package from 1990 to 1993, minus the division series, which had not yet been created. Hill insisted that Fox was not destined to suffer a fate similar to that of CBS, which lost nearly half of its four-year, $1.06 billion investment.</p>
        <p>Pilson, who made that deal, recalled that CBS was bedeviled by a recession, the Gulf War and World Series featuring Toronto, a market that is not included in the Nielsen ratings. ''But the market is better now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hill said one of the crucial elements to making the new deal was the growth of its owned and operated stations division. Fox owns 23 televisions stations, including Channel 5, and recently acquired 10 more.</p>
        <p>In addition, Fox's new deal includes a renewal of its cable rights on Fox Sports Net and Fx, spreading the financial burden beyond the broadcast network. CBS did not have any cable properties on which to show baseball.</p>
        <p>Hill said he was not worried that ABC, NBC and CBS would load up their best first-run and event programming to counter the league championship series and World Series on Fox. Rather, he points to how Fox can now set its own advertising rates without being tethered to NBC's pricing, and package multiple World Series deals with advertisers.</p>
        <p>Pilson said that having the postseason is a bigger ratings boost for Fox, which ranks fourth in the ratings race, than for any other network. The World Series, which has rated between a 14.1 and a 17.4 since 1996, is still a marquee event but is a much better prime-time alternative to entertainment programming for Fox than for NBC, ABC or CBS.</p>
        <p>''The World Series was good for Fox and NBC, but dramatically better for Fox,'' he said. ''But the issue is the impact it will have on its prime-time schedule. ABC and CBS wouldn't make this deal because it would have such an impact on launching its fall prime-time schedule. It may not have as much an impact on Fox's prime time as Fox thinks it will have.''</p>
        <p>NBC, without the National Football League and, starting next season, baseball, is now focused on the National Basketball Association; Nascar (starting next season); the Olympics through 2008; Notre Dame football; golf; the Wimbledon and French Open tennis tournaments; launching the fledgling XFL with the World Wrestling Federation; and, starting next year, the Triple Crown horse races.</p>
