        <p>Vinny Testaverde said he was misunderstood, though he did not regret what he said on Monday. Al Groh blamed the news media. The spin controlling was at full whirl today as Testaverde, the Jets' quarterback, and Groh, the head coach, hurried to quell speculation that their relationship was anything but splendid.</p>
        <p>''We talked about a number of things, from the offense trying to be more consistent, to college football, to our wives and families, to artists,'' Testaverde said of a brief meeting he had with Groh on Tuesday. ''I'm mentioning that to give you a sense of the relationship Al and I have, because what I've read is way off. Al and I have always had an open line of communication. I have nothing but the utmost respect for Coach Groh. I don't want anyone to think he and I are on bad terms and we disagree.''</p>
        <p>Testaverde claimed to be surprised that his comments caused such a stir. On Monday, he said he was unhappy after being benched for a series against Tampa Bay and seemed even less pleased that Groh had failed to tell him until he was halfway out on the field for the next drive.</p>
        <p>Testaverde is usually extremely measured in his public comments, and he surely knew as he spoke Monday that his open display of unhappiness would be jarring.</p>
        <p>''You can fault me for being human,'' Testaverde said. He said his emotions boiled over partly because of his frustration with his and the offense's inconsistency and with being beaten up by the physical Buccaneers.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I led you to believe that things were in more disarray than what they are,'' Testaverde said. ''I'll take the blame on that.''</p>
        <p>Today, Testaverde said that he did not disagree with Groh's decision to briefly bench him. Groh told him that he was on the phone with defensive coaches and could not tell him directly. Groh took that blame for that on Monday. But nobody apologized Tuesday, Testaverde said, adding that no apology was necessary.</p>
        <p>Testaverde carries a copy of Rudyard Kipling's poem, ''If,'' which begins, ''If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. . . .''</p>
        <p>Testaverde said, ''Sometimes when you keep it in, it builds up, but when you talk and are able to discuss things, you feel better.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking to be in the headlines every day. I don't want anything to distract this team from what we have going.</p>
        <p>''I've been around long enough to know that if the quarterback and head coach are at odds, the team is heading south,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Groh was clearly irritated by the first crisis of the season. He blamed reporters, calling it ''a media-created distraction.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Testaverde credited linebacker Bryan Cox with getting him back in the game, saying that Cox went to Groh and said that if the Jets were to lose, they would lose with Testaverde. Groh seemed to chafe at the suggestion that he had been influenced by Cox.</p>
        <p>''I substitute the players on this team,'' Groh said.</p>
        <p>Testaverde, who said he had been in Groh's office at least a dozen times in the past to talk to his coach, has spoken to Groh on behalf of the team about some rigorous training camp practices that left players grumbling. Some reports have suggested that their relationship has been strained ever since. But today, Groh said he felt as comfortable with Testaverde as with any player, and that there was no crisis or tension in their relationship.</p>
        <p>''I know what the state of mind is,'' Groh said of Testaverde, his voice rising as he addressed reporters. ''I know it's a heck of a lot different than what you said in the newspaper. I feel very good about things. If interceptions come from being off the mark, you would have a lot more interceptions than Vinny has had. It's a stupid issue because people are trying to create something that doesn't exist, and that's what aggravates me. Those things drain energy from the team.''</p>
        <p>Still, Testaverde is clearly not happy with how the offense is playing, and yesterday he conceded that things were not coming as easily as they did in 1998. He tried to explain some of the misplays from Sunday and said that part of the problem was that the Jets were playing with some different players. Read: without Keyshawn Johnson.</p>
        <p>Testaverde said he did not mean to make it sound on Monday as if he was blaming receivers for running the wrong routes or coaches for failing to make appropriate substitutions. But he also made plain again that he should not be taking the brunt of the blame for the offensive miscues that have made the Jets' spectacular fourth-quarter comebacks necessary.</p>
        <p>''When I was in Tampa, we weren't winning many games and a lot of the blame was put on my shoulders,'' Testaverde said. ''There were other guys that were not held accountable, and because I was being held responsible, they used me to hide behind. The more people that hid, the more losing we did. If we get more guys to stand up and help carry the load, the more winning we'll have.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the Jets are already winning plenty, which makes this dustup even more curious. It's a good thing that the Jets, at 4-0, have a bye week. They seem as if they could use some time apart.</p>
        <p>''The perception is the unhappy quarterback and that's not the reality,'' Testaverde said. ''I wouldn't trade places with anybody in the league right now.''</p>
