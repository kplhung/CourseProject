        <p>After deliberating for six months, Israel's attorney general said he had found insufficient evidence to prosecute former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges, clearing the way for a possible political comeback by the conservative leader.</p>
        <p>In a decision released tonight, Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein said he had rejected a police recommendation that Mr. Netanyahu and his wife, Sarah, face criminal charges of bribery, fraud and theft.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubinstein said he had closed the case because he did not foresee ''a reasonable chance of conviction.''</p>
        <p>But, with biting language, Mr. Rubinstein condemned Mr. Netanyahu for ''improper'' conduct and said the ''picture before us'' had given prosecutors ''an ill feeling.'' He acknowledged that the state attorney, Edna Arbel, disagreed with his conclusion, urging indictment on some charges.</p>
        <p>In an investigation that began more than a year ago, the police suspected the Netanyahus of conspiring with a contractor in an illegal kickback scheme, of stealing gifts to the state and of obstructing justice.</p>
        <p>The Netanyahus denied wrongdoing, claiming persecution by political enemies and, after television cameras were alerted to raids of their home, by an overly zealous police force.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether Mr. Netanyahu will now rebound into politics, seizing the momentum to re-establish himself at the head of a rudderless right wing. Associates say he will not make a decision immediately, waiting instead to see if the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations produce a deal that could shore up Prime Minister Ehud Barak's tenuous hold on power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak released a statement saying he respected the attorney general's decision, understood the Netanyahus' ''feeling of relief'' and wished the couple a happy New Year. Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, starts on Friday night.</p>
        <p>In Atlanta on business, Mr. Netanyahu, who has spent the last year as a consultant to Israeli technology companies, declined to comment on the attorney general's decision or on his political future. He said only that he was ''relieved, relieved, relieved.'' Mr. Netanyahu prepared to fly back to Israel.</p>
        <p>In an interview this summer, Mr. Netanyahu described the investigation as wrenching and scarring. He said his sons, 5 and 9, had been taunted at school. ''We've been in very dire straits,'' he said in August. ''For the boys, going to school and hearing other kids saying, 'Your father's a thief, your mother's a criminal' -- it's been very hard.''</p>
        <p>For three tumultuous years, Mr. Netanyahu led Israel at the helm of a religious and nationalist coalition that was perceived internationally as obstructionist to peace. He stepped down from politics on the night in May 1999 that Mr. Barak, who ran on a peacemaking platform, overwhelmingly defeated him.</p>
        <p>Ever since, the Israeli right has been splintered, incapable of mounting an effective opposition to Mr. Barak even as the prime minister's government has teetered on the edge of collapse. As a result, even though Mr. Netanyahu disappointed many followers and alienated many political colleagues while in office, nostalgia has grown for his political skills and telegenic style.</p>
        <p>Opinion polls show Mr. Netanyahu neck and neck with Mr. Barak -- far stronger as a candidate than Ariel Sharon, the former general and defense minister who took his place atop the Likud Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon, 72, has indicated that he will seek to retain the leadership, and several younger Likud officials have said they are considering a bid for the post when party primaries are held. But Mr. Netanyahu, 50, could change their plans by throwing his hat back in the ring.</p>
        <p>The hint of a return by Mr. Netanyahu, in fact, could push Mr. Sharon to consider joining a unity government with Mr. Barak to keep himself from being shunted aside. But that is likely only if the present Israeli-Palestinian deadlock continues.</p>
        <p>Associates today urged Mr. Netanyahu to make a quick decision. Reuven Rivlin, a Likud lawmaker, said Mr. Netanyahu, if he intends a comeback, should ''return to activity immediately and put an end to this whispering campaign and to a postponement that could cause the Likud serious damage.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Michael Eitan, another Likud legislator who was a sharp critic of Mr. Netanyahu's leadership, cautioned the party against romanticizing a politician ''responsible for the largest electoral drubbing the Likud has ever known, and for the early dissolution of the government.'' Likud won only 19 seats in the election that Mr. Netanyahu lost, 7 less than Mr. Barak's One Israel/Labor alignment and two more than the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party.</p>
        <p>This is the second time that Mr. Rubinstein has declined to indict Mr. Netanyahu because of what he has termed insufficient evidence while sharply criticizing his comportment.</p>
        <p>In 1997, while Mr. Netanyahu was prime minister, the police suggested that he stand trial on corruption charges in a case involving a supposed deal between Mr. Netanyahu and the former Shas leader, Aryeh Deri, who is now in prison on a corruption conviction.</p>
        <p>The police alleged that Mr. Netanyahu had agreed to appoint an attorney general, Roni Bar-On, who would be sympathetic to Mr. Deri, in exchange for his party's support for the so-called Hebron interim agreement with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Gearing up for a possible challenge by Mr. Netanyahu, One Israel/Labor leaders were quick to recall that case tonight. ''I think that it is only in a country like Israel that after two particularly critical public reports there can still be talk about a political comeback,'' said Ophir Pines Paz, chairman of One Israel.</p>
        <p>In the current case, the police said the Netanyahus had ''illegally removed'' gifts to the state of Israel, including candelabras, silverware and carpets, when they left the prime minister's residence. They also said the Netanyahus had accepted up to $100,000 worth of free services from a contractor who later billed the state for the private work.</p>
        <p>In his report, Mr. Rubinstein said it was ''improper behavior for a governing officials'' to ''amass great debt'' to a private individual, the contractor, who was interested in nurturing a relationship with the prime minister and his wife.</p>
