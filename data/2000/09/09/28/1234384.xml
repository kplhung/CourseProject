        <p>Overwhelmed by the competing proposals in a tight presidential race, Michael Horst grabbed a sheet of paper during the evening news the other night and drew a line down the middle. He wrote ''Gore'' on the left, ''Bush'' on the right, and then rated the candidates' positions, drawing a plus sign in the Bush column next to capital punishment and a minus sign next to the Texas governor's education record.</p>
        <p>But nowhere on his cheat sheet did Mr. Horst mention an issue that has been the focus of much moralizing on the campaign trail: sex and violence in movies and popular music, and on the Internet.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Horst, 39, said he had agonized over how his 11-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son were being affected by the seepage of nudity and mayhem into what they watch and hear, he said he was not looking to politicians for answers. It was, he said, something he could best grapple with on his own, however imperfectly.</p>
        <p>''I really don't feel anything they say on this is going to influence me one way or the other,'' said Mr. Horst, a theft prevention manager for the Rite Aid chain of drugstores. ''What decision they make is not going to affect what my children see.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Horst's sentiments echoed through more than a dozen other interviews with parents of adolescents in Westland, a middle-class suburb of Detroit that, like the rest of Michigan, is considered to be a close call in the presidential race. Neither Republicans nor Democrats dominate here.</p>
        <p>Westlanders supported President Clinton, a Democrat, in 1992 and 1996, and Gov. John Engler, a Republican, in 1994 and 1998, and nearly everyone interviewed said they had not decided whom they would vote for in November.</p>
        <p>But as they shopped for milk at Kroger, ate ice cream at the Westland Mall, sat in the bleachers at the Westland Sports Arena or even waited for an adjustment at Shunkwiler Chiropractic, most parents agreed that it was their responsibility -- and not that of the president, Congress or even Hollywood -- to filter what reaches their children. The candidates, they suggested, should save their breath for the economy and health care.</p>
        <p>Yet all the parents conceded that they sometimes blurred the borders they had drawn between acceptable and unacceptable content.</p>
        <p>Jenny Palise, 44, a homemaker whose husband is a tool-and-die maker at the Ford plant in Rawnsonville, said she tried to shield her son Anthony, 12, from nudity and bad language in movies. But the other day, after skimming a review of ''The Watcher'' to gauge its appropriateness for her son, she decided to take him to see the film, which was rated R.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know it was about a serial killer,'' Ms. Palise said, loading groceries into her customized van. ''I thought it was about a stalker.''</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Palise regretted asking Anthony to come along, he was unfazed. ''I fell asleep,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That even the sturdiest dams erected by parents can occasionally spring holes was obvious as Phyllis Blackman shopped for gospel records at Record Town in the Westland Mall with her 16-year-old daughter, La Toya Hamilton. Ms. Blackman said she had a zero-tolerance policy against rap -- unless it was the feel-good rap of the Hollywood star Will Smith.</p>
        <p>''She doesn't play the stupid stuff in the house,'' Ms. Blackman said.</p>
        <p>But as La Toya sought out a compact disc by the gospel singer Yolanda Adams, an artist adored by both mother and daughter, La Toya said she also enjoyed the music of the slain rapper Tupac Shakur,  which, she admitted, is layered with references to ''sex, bad-mouthing of some females, violence and killing.''</p>
        <p>''I knew she had it,'' Ms. Blackman said. ''It's not something she continues to listen to on a daily basis.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Horst, the Rite Aid manager, said he ''blew my cork'' when he discovered that his 8-year-old son had seen an Austin Powers  video, rated PG-13, at a friend's house.</p>
        <p>''Everything with Austin Powers has a sexual connotation, and I got hit with a lot of questions an 8-year-old shouldn't be asking,'' Mr. Horst said, watching from a bench at the arena as the boy scrimmaged with his ice hockey team, the Westland Eagles.</p>
        <p>And yet Mr. Horst said that he did not hesitate to let his son watch the explosion-laden ''Terminator'' movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and that he took the boy and his 11-year-old sister to see ''Titanic.''</p>
        <p>''That had a moderately explicit scene,'' Mr. Horst said. ''My daughter asked me, 'Dad, what are they doing?' I said, 'He's an artist; he's painting her; they're not actually doing any intimate acts.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Horst, a self-described conservative who is a registered Republican, and Ms. Palise and Ms. Blackman, both Democrats, said they considered themselves strict.</p>
        <p>Almost none of those interviewed said they wanted Washington to censor Hollywood, or even Hollywood to censor itself.</p>
        <p>The one pledge that they hoped Hollywood would make would be to swear off marketing violent fare directly to teenagers, the subject of a Congressional hearing today, and a Federal Trade Commission report earlier this month.</p>
        <p>In speaking against more regulation of Hollywood, the parents repeatedly cited their belief in freedom of speech, and said they often enjoyed material that they would prefer their children not see.</p>
        <p>Mark Obsniuk, 48, a mail carrier whose children are 12, 14 and 16, said that any effort by Washington to rein in Hollywood would be ''a waste of time.'' As his youngest child, Jenna, twirled on the ice during a skating lesson, Mr. Obsniuk described how he and his wife, Debbie, an elementary school secretary, enjoyed watching programs like ''The Sopranos,'' the bloody and often sexually charged mob drama on HBO. But he said that they were careful to change the channel whenever their children entered the room.</p>
        <p>Having voted for George Bush in 1988 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996,  Mr. Obsniuk said he was undecided between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But he said that his assessment of the economy, and of which candidate presented the best chance for continued prosperity, would drive his thinking.</p>
        <p>Sitting in the bleachers nearby, Kevin Beahon, 47, a quality control inspector at the Ford national parts depot in Livonia, said he was eminently qualified to screen what reaches the eyes and ears of his sons, 13 and 16, and his daughter, 7.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beahon, a likely Bush voter who has barred his two younger children from watching adult-oriented cartoons like ''The Simpsons'' and ''South Park,'' said he had gotten pretty good at navigating the music Web site Napster. When someone left a note on the front door for his 13-year-old son, Stephen, imploring him to ''Get Your Roll On,'' Mr. Beahon was puzzled. Stephen told his dad that his friend was using the title of a song by a rap act called Big Tymers to urge him to get going to a party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beahon went straight to the Internet to retrieve the song, and after listening to its rapid-fire references to oral sex, male genitalia, adultery and prostitution, he concluded: ''This is the crudest thing I've ever heard.'' Though he admits he cannot control what his son hears outside the home, he told the boy, ''I don't want to ever hear that again.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, he added, ''I don't think a president should be delving into that.''</p>
        <p>In a community where many residents work in the skilled trades or middle management at auto plants in surrounding communities, few of those interviewed said they recognized the name of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr. Gore's running mate.</p>
        <p>And fewer still were aware that, among the candidates on the two national tickets, Mr. Lieberman has waged the loudest campaign against what he describes as Hollywood's shrinking mores.</p>
        <p>''Tell me the name again, because I'm good with names and I'll be sure to remember it,'' said one undecided voter and parent, a saleswoman at a furniture store.</p>
        <p>Another parent, Tracy Hart, 34, whose presidential vote see-sawed from Michael S. Dukakis, a Democrat, in 1988, to George Bush in 1992 and then to President Clinton in 1996, was one of the few people interviewed here who lamented that the issue of sex and violence in Hollywood was ''not one of the major issues on the forefront, in terms of the campaign.''</p>
        <p>As they loaded their car outside Kroger, her daughter, Hillary, 11, quickly corrected her mother, raising the name of Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>''Who's that?'' asked Ms. Hart, a single mother who is an administrator at a physical therapy and rehabilitation clinic.</p>
        <p>Her daughter, citing an article in the Time magazine spin-off ''Time for Kids,'' responded: ''He doesn't think kids should be able to go to R-rated movies and he thinks bad music is bad. He wants to do something about it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hart said, ''Well, maybe we know who we're voting for now.''</p>
