        <p>The way Venus Williams dominated Elena Dementieva with her sling-blade strokes was expected, as was her customary parade queen's wave to the crowd upon match point, as was her giddy acceptance of the gold medal.</p>
        <p>But when the national anthem hit a crescendo this afternoon, the statuesque Williams stood at the top of the medal stand and wiped a tear from her eye. No one could remember her being moved like this. Usually, Williams's rawest emotions remain hidden beneath her veil of confidence. Today, she allowed the moment to overwhelm her and appeared humbled by the Olympic experience.</p>
        <p>It was a good look for Williams. Upon her 32nd straight victory, she discarded the superior attitude that has often marked her post-match personality. After receiving a gold medal that she'll soon frame, she praised her Russian opponent's resilience and complimented her aggressiveness. As the punctuation to the Summer of Venus, she was absorbed in team spirit, not in her own achievement.</p>
        <p>''This is much more meaningful than I thought,'' said Williams after wearing down Dementieva, 6-2, 6-4, in the gold medal match at the tennis center. ''I felt really emotional. I felt really excited.</p>
        <p>''It was just really one moment in time, because you see it on TV, how the competitor bows their head, and they put the medal on. It was really great. It was me.''</p>
        <p>This moment is one reason why she ignored the exhaustion caused by her packed summer schedule. When she arrived in Sydney, she was tired, but quickly bounced back. She embraced the spectacle of the opening ceremony, met other athletes during Olympic pin exchanges and found a little kick of adrenaline as her matches came along.</p>
        <p>Today, the only noticeable dip in her enthusiasm registered when she discussed the injury to her teammate and former gold medalist from the 1996 team, Lindsay Davenport. Somehow, the animosity that grew between the two at the United States Open has disappeared. As much as anyone, Williams did not want to see Davenport go down during the first week of the Games. If Davenport had been healthy, she might have joined Williams and the bronze medalist, Monica Seles, in a United States sweep on the medal stand today.</p>
        <p>''Potentially, we could have all been on the stand -- in any order,'' said Williams, whose most difficult match along her route to the final was her three-set victory against Seles. ''I was fortunate enough to get the gold, but Monica could have won the match she played against me the other day. She could have won the gold. One of my only regrets is that Lindsay wasn't here.''</p>
        <p>But Venus was -- and then some. Everyone in the crowd received an up-close look at the one player who has rocked on as a solo act this summer. They saw the player who is all the rage. Just after tucking away a shaky third try at a match point, Williams took a detour to the players' box. From the United States coaches, Billie Jean King and Zina Garrison, she grabbed an American flag in one hand and held her racket in the other. It was an ambidextrous celebration for the ubiquitous Williams. For an entire summer, she has been everywhere, equally dominant on different continents.</p>
        <p>But soon, her summer will end. And fall classes will begin. Although she will play some select tournaments, Williams will plop down in a fashion design class. And if a teacher or classmate should ask, ''So, what did you do last summer?'' she can present the show-and-tell of all time.</p>
        <p>She has a Wimbledon winner's plate and a United States Open trophy. The only thing she didn't take was the No. 1 ranking. Injured for six months of the season, Williams couldn't catch the consistent Martina Hingis, who still owns the top ranking. ''I think Venus, she's the more stronger,'' said Dementieva. ''But Hingis plays much better than her.''</p>
        <p>That's up for debate. Next year, the intrigue will begin. Can the clever Hingis finally decode Williams's strength? Will Serena Williams become her sister's major test? This summer, Venus Williams had only one opponent to fear: herself.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, I can get a little crazy,'' Williams said. ''I can make a lot of mistakes and play badly. So sometimes, I'm scared for myself.''</p>
        <p>Today, her victory wasn't about herself. When she won, humility joined her in the medal ceremony.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, the Wimbledons and the Grand Slams, you have so many opportunities,'' Williams said. ''But this gold is just every four years. Who knows, in 2004, I might not be chosen. You never know what is going to happen. So this is the one moment for me, for my country, for my family, for the team.''</p>
