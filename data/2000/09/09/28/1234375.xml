        <p>A federal district court judge here ruled today that the public should have access to extensive information on tire technology that Firestone was compelled to turn over during a lawsuit over a fatal accident. The company said that releasing the documents would amount to giving up trade secrets.</p>
        <p>Judicial secrecy has emerged as a major issue in Washington as Congress tries to draft new laws improving the ability of Government regulators to monitor safety trends. Officials at the Department of Transportation say the sealing of documents in settled lawsuits is one reason they did not spot the pattern of scores of rollover deaths in Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires that failed.</p>
        <p>In a biting ruling in favor of four news organizations that had sued for release of the documents, Judge Anthony A. Alaimo dismissed Firestone's assertion that the information would be valuable to its competitors. ''A competitor would not want to replicate the designs or processes used to make a tire that has now been recalled in countries around the world,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>Still, the judge delayed release of the documents for a week to give Firestone time to appeal.</p>
        <p>Christine Karbowiak, a spokeswoman for Firestone, said in a telephone interview that even if the information was about tires being recalled, it could be valuable to competitors. ''It's traditional know-how that in many, many manufacturing contexts is know-how that should be protected,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In testimony before House and Senate committees this month, two vice presidents of Firestone, a unit of the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, promised to drop secrecy provisions in lawsuits except as they concerned trade secrets. One proposal before Congress would make manufacturers tell the government if they had been sued three times over defects in the same product.</p>
        <p>The documents in the Georgia case, involving a 19-year-old's death in an Explorer, are being sought by lawyers for The Los Angeles Times, CBS News, The Chicago Tribune and The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>Separately, documents released today by Congressional investigators show that in the year before the Ford Motor Company stopped buying tires from Goodyear for Explorers, the automaker pressed Goodyear to cut its prices to match those charged by its rival Firestone.</p>
        <p>The Goodyear tires, which were used on half of Ford's 1996 and 1997 Explorers, have subsequently proved much more reliable, a distinction that has drawn the interest of Congress as it seeks explanations for the scores of deadly accidents involving Explorers equipped with Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Michael Vaughn, a Ford spokesman, said that Ford routinely negotiates with all its suppliers for the best available prices. But Ford, he noted, also demands that suppliers meet extensive technical specifications.</p>
        <p>''Firestone was selected, as a single source in this case, because it met our requirements between cost, quality and production capability,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Asked whether Firestone had made any quality-related production decisions in order to bid lower than Goodyear, Ms. Karbowiak, the Firestone spokeswoman, responded in a statement that ''we would never take any steps that would impair the safety of those tires.''</p>
        <p>Federal crash records show that through the end of last year, there were only three tire-related deaths in 1996 and 1997 Ford Explorers equipped at the factory with Goodyear tires, compared with 26 such deaths involving Explorers from those two model years equipped with Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Firestone supplied all of the tires for new Explorers for the 1991 through 1995 model years, split the contract with Goodyear in the 1996 and 1997 model years, and resumed supplying tires for all new Explorers in the 1998 through 2001 model years.</p>
        <p>Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is leading the House investigation of 101 deaths attributed to Firestone tires, said tonight that ''Ford has never satisfactorily explained to us why they dropped Goodyear as a supplier of tires for its Explorer.''</p>
        <p>Chuck Sinclair, a spokesman for Goodyear, said that the tire maker had lost the Explorer contract because it had been unwilling to sell tires for as low a price as Ford was ready to pay.</p>
        <p>One of the documents released today by Mr. Tauzin was a letter from Ford to Goodyear dated Jan. 26, 1996, turning down a request for higher prices. Ford told Goodyear that it was already charging more than its competitors for eight tire models, including the tires for the Explorer.</p>
        <p>A Ford memorandum dated April 4, 1996, also released by Mr. Tauzin, said that Ford had ''challenged Goodyear to become price competitive'' on five tire models, although it was not clear if these included the Explorer tires. The document said that Goodyear had responded by proposing changes in tire construction of the tires that would save $500,000 to $700,000 that year.</p>
        <p>In another blow to Firestone, the tire maker said today that Saudi Arabia had banned the import of all Firestone brand tires. The failure of 16-inch Firestone tires on Ford Explorers there has been attributed to several deaths over the last three years, and was one of the first warnings of tire problems on Explorers.</p>
        <p>Firestone criticized Saudi regulators for the decision. ''We feel the scope of this action is uncalled for and extreme given the voluntary worldwide recall'' of 15-inch tires for Explorers, the tire maker said.</p>
        <p>Ford began replacing 16-inch Firestone tires on Explorers in Saudi Arabia at its own expense, after Firestone refused to do so; the tiremaker contended that part of the problem was that Explorers were too prone to roll over. A Ford memo obtained by Congressional investigators said Firestone was leery of recalling the tires partly for fear that it would be banned from the Saudi market.</p>
