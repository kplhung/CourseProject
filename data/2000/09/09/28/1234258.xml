        <p>If you are a designer working at home, have a thriving business and are thinking of expanding into commercial Midtown Manhattan, think again. The severe shortage of office space and record rents (up nearly 30 percent over the last year) are driving longtime New Yorkers out. One of the most prominent teams to go, Massimo and Lella Vignelli, above -- designers of elegant graphics, furniture and exhibitions, including the Venetian glass show at the American Craft Museum -- made a painful decision to close their celebrated minimalist office at 475 10th Avenue (37th Street) when their 15-year lease expires next month. Rent on the 12,000-square-foot space rose sixfold, to $62.50 a square foot.</p>
        <p>Homeowners looking for familiar antique shops in SoHo may also find that they have relocated. Peter Roberts Antiques has ended its 14-year stay at 134 Spring Street. ''When our lease was about to expire we learned that our rent quadrupled,'' said Robert Melita, a partner. The shop relocated to 39 Bond Street, the once peripheral but emerging district adjacent to the Bowery, where prices are in the $50- to $55-a-square-foot range versus $150 a square foot for SoHo. (The partners' old space was rented by a luxury shoe store.)</p>

        <p>Where will the Vignellis relocate? They're looking in Long Island City. Until then, ''we will be working out of our house,'' Mrs. Vignelli said, ''just like we did years ago when we started our firm.'' Thus, careers come full circle.</p>
