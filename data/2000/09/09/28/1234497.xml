        <p>The Rangers, in Coach Ron Low's words, hedged their bets yesterday by leaving two highly paid veterans, John MacLean and Rich Pilon, available among their unprotected players for tomorrow's National Hockey League waiver draft.</p>
        <p>''You take a chance by exposing the older guy,'' Low said, referring to MacLean, a right wing, who turns 36 in November, and Pilon, a 32-year-old defenseman. ''If you lose him, you're not going to be happy. But if you lose a young guy, you're even less happy. We don't want to lose John MacLean. We don't want to lose anybody.''</p>
        <p>There is a good chance the Rangers might not. MacLean is scheduled to make $2.5 million this season and he has a bad back. Pilon from the Rangers' roster might allow a younger player to make the team. During Wednesday night's 4-4 tie in Columbus, Ohio, both Pavel Brendl and Jamie Lundmark, a pair of 19-year-old forwards, helped their causes.</p>
        <p>Brendl had three assists in his strongest showing of the preseason. And Lundmark, normally a center, was impressive at right wing on a line with center Mike York and left wing Jeff Ulmer.</p>
        <p>Mike Mottau, the 22-year-old defenseman from Boston College who won the Hobey Baker Award, continued to erase any resentment over his training camp holdout.</p>
        <p>''He's been a real eye-opener,'' said Low. ''He's got a chance to make this team, I'll tell you that. He sure hasn't done anything to hurt his chances.''</p>

        <p>ISLANDERS DANGLE LAWRENCE IN DRAFT: The veteran forward Mark Lawrence, who appeared in 91 games for the Islanders over the past three seasons, was among a half-dozen players the team made available for the N.H.L. waiver draft.</p>
        <p>Also left unprotected were defensemen Anders Myrvold and Dan Trebil, signed as free agents this summer; Jesse Belanger, a center signed in July; and Dmitiri Nabokov, a forward, and Ray Schultz, a defenseman, veterans who had been cut.</p>
        <p>Lawrence, assigned to Chicago of the International Hockey League along with Belanger on Sept. 21, had a breakthrough season in 1998-99 and was rewarded with a $1.6 million contract. He was a disappointment last season, however, scoring only one goal in 29 games and spending most of the season in the minors.</p>
        <p>Each team was allowed to protect 18 skaters and two goalies from its pool of waiver-eligible players.</p>

        <p>DEVILS HALT TALKS WITH NIEDER-MAYER AND ARNOTT: Lou Lamoriello, the president of the Devils, stopped negotiations last week with Don Meehan, the agent who represents Scott Niedermayer and Jason Arnott, the Devils' two unsigned restricted free agents. But Niedermayer confirmed last night that Lamoriello had visited him at his home in British Columbia recently and he said they had a positive meeting.</p>
        <p>Lamoriello, who was in Philadelphia last night where the Devils lost, 4-1, to the Flyers, refused to discuss the matter. But Niedermayer spoke by telephone from his home, saying: ''I made my points and he did the same. We had a fine discussion and I hope we resolve this.''</p>
        <p>Niedermayer said that Meehan would talk with Lamoriello again before the end of the week in an attempt to reach an agreement. ''I'd love to be there on opening night and defend the Stanley Cup,'' Neidermayer said. ''I'm prepared to give a little if he does the same.''</p>
        <p>Niedermayer had been seeking a three-year contract escalating from $4 million to $5 million, but last night he said he was willing to settle for any length of contract, from one to four years.</p>
        <p>Lamoriello's offer, according to Meehan in a conference call last week, is for salaries of $3.5 million, $3.6 million and $3.7 million. Niedermayer, the Devils' top-scoring defensemen the last five years, made $3.25 million last season.</p>
        <p>Arnott, who scored the Stanley-Cup clinching goal, made $1.8 million in each of the last two seasons and wants a two-year contract for $3.8 and $4 million; Lamoriello's offer is for $2.5 and $2.6.</p>
