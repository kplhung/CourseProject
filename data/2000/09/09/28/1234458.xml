        <p>Kerry Wood closed his comeback season with eight scoreless innings, striking out 10 to lead Chicago over Philadelphia, 1-0, at Wrigley Field.</p>
        <p>Sammy Sosa singled home Wood for his 137th run batted in as the Cubs won for only the sixth time in their last 26 games.</p>
        <p>Wood (8-7), who missed all of last season following elbow surgery, gave up eight hits and two walks in eight innings. He threw 125 pitches, the most in any of his 23 starts this season.</p>
        <p>Wood, the 1998 N.L. rookie of the year, ended the season with a 4.80 earned run average, totaling 132 strikeouts in 137 innings. In his previous start Sept. 22 against St. Louis, Wood walked eight in only one and one-third innings.</p>
        <p>MARLINS 6, EXPOS 3: A.J. Burnett hit an R.B.I. triple to spark a four-run fifth-inning and also pitched six and two-thirds strong innings to lead host Florida over Montreal.</p>
        <p>Burnett (3-7) allowed two runs -- one earned -- three hits and five walks to help Florida win for the fourth time in five games. He also struck out seven as Montreal lost its fifth straight.</p>
        <p>Tony Armas Jr. (7-9) allowed five runs, four hits and four walks in four and one-third innings, snapping his three-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>ASTROS 10, PIRATES 1: Jeff Bagwell hit his career-high 46th home run and drove in four runs as Houston beat Pittsburgh at Three Rivers Satdium.</p>
        <p>Bagwell's three-run homer in the fifth came off Jimmy Anderson (5-11), two innings after Tim Bogar hit Houston's first inside-the-park homer of the season.</p>
        <p>Bagwell has 131 R.B.I. and has scored 151 runs.</p>
        <p>Tony McKnight (4-1) held the Pirates to four hits for his first complete game, winning his fourth consecutive decision. He struck out seven and walked one.</p>
        <p>BREWERS 10, REDS 6: Scott Sullivan's wild pitch allowed the go-ahead run to score in the seventh as host Milwaukee beat Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>The last night game in Milwaukee County Stadium history was followed by a fireworks show. The teams close out the stadium's 48-year run this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Sullivan uncorked the Reds' 94th wild pitch of the season, tying a major league record set by the Texas Rangers in 1986.</p>
        <p>That capped the Brewers' three-run rally that erased a 4-2 deficit and made a winner of Valerio De Los Santos (2-3).</p>
