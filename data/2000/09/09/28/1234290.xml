        <p>IN Manhattan, it's easy to find cabinets and appliances, but hard to find a contractor who is professional and willing to work on a kitchen for $20,000 or less including labor. Here are seven contractors, carpenters and cabinetmakers who will work within those restraints, and who are recommended by the designers of the seven kitchens.</p>
        <p>The $12,000 kitchen with solid walnut  counters: Willy Rios, a carpenter, custom-made the walnut counters and installed the walnut veneer. Information: (201) 951-8580.</p>
