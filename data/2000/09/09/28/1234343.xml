        <p>Gov. George W. Bush concluded three days of education events today with a visit to a parochial school in this city's heavily Hispanic South-Central section, talking about reading, character education and discipline. But there was one issue Mr. Bush did not so much as mention: school vouchers.</p>
        <p>That Mr. Bush, the Republican candidate for president, would avoid discussing at a Catholic school a policy that many Catholic parents staunchly support -- and that he has endorsed -- spoke volumes about the way he has been campaigning on the education issue this week.</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Bush's aides distributed a 16-page pamphlet on his education agenda that does not use the words school vouchers. On Tuesday afternoon, when asked if he supported vouchers, Mr. Bush sidestepped the issue by saying the decision should be left to state and local officials. And on Tuesday evening, when Larry King asked him on his CNN program whether he thought vouchers worked, Mr. Bush replied, ''I'm not positive.''</p>
        <p>From his extraordinarily careful handling of the issue, one might conclude that Mr. Bush harbored deep reservations about vouchers. But in fact, a voucherlike proposal is an integral part of his plan to push public schools to be more accountable for student achievement.</p>
        <p>Under his proposal, the federal government could take aid away from chronically failing schools and give it directly to low-income parents. The parents could use the money -- $1,500 per student -- for a variety of educational purposes, including private school tuition.</p>
        <p>That is the widely accepted definition of a voucher, yet Mr. Bush declines to use the word, suggesting that he considers it loaded with bad connotations. Instead, he and his running mate, Dick Cheney, emphasize the concept of choice. Their plan, they say, would provide poor children trapped in bad schools a range of options normally available only to the more affluent, such as hiring tutors, transferring to other public schools or attending private schools.</p>
        <p>''A voucher connotes that you want everybody to take the money and flee into the private world,'' said B. Alexander Kress, an education adviser to Mr. Bush. ''I think the governor is of the notion that the problems will be fixed by the public schools. But if they aren't, then there are these other options.''</p>
        <p>But aides to Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, contend that Mr. Bush is running away from a contentious policy that they say is widely opposed by the moderate swing voters, particularly women, he is assiduously  courting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush ''realizes most Americans don't agree with vouchers,'' asserted Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign. ''That's why they don't use the word vouchers for what is a voucher plan.''</p>
        <p>Actually, many polls suggest that the public is divided on the matter. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in July showed that 47 percent of voters supported the concept of taxpayer-financed vouchers, while 46 percent opposed it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore strongly opposes taxpayer-financed vouchers, arguing that they drain public aid away from the schools that need it most. That is also the position of the powerful teachers unions that are expected to provide important support in getting out the Democratic vote in November.</p>
        <p>Viewed more broadly, Mr. Bush's approach to vouchers is similar to his handling of a number of contentious conservative policies. Mr. Bush has won support from groups like the National Rifle Association and the National Right to Life Committee by opposing most forms of gun control and by vowing to sign legislation outlawing the procedure known by opponents as partial-birth abortion. Yet he rarely discusses those views on the stump.</p>
        <p>During a week in which Mr. Bush focused on education, hammering at Mr. Gore's policies and warning of an ''education recession,'' his avoidance of the word, or even the concept, of vouchers was often striking.</p>
        <p>The pamphlet his campaign issued on Monday, titled ''Ending the Education Recession,'' says that Mr. Bush of Texas would give parents ''real options -- like tutoring or the ability to transfer to another school,'' avoiding any mention that the money could be used for private or parochial schools.</p>
        <p>At a public high school in Redwood City, Calif., on Tuesday, a student asked Mr. Bush how he felt about vouchers. Mr. Bush never acknowledged that he supported the concept.</p>
        <p>''If the state of California wants to do that, it's up to the state of California,'' he said. ''I believe in local control of schools.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney offered a similar answer to voters in a visit to Michigan on Tuesday. Michigan and California have hotly contested ballot initiatives this year calling for the creation of voucher systems.</p>
        <p>Later on Tuesday, during his interview on ''Larry King Live,'' Mr. Bush said, ''I'm not positive vouchers work.'' But, he continued, ''I think we ought to try them.''</p>
