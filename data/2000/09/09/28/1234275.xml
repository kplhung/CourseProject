        <p>On 12th day of 2000 Olympic boxing tournament, Russia has placed seven fighers in semifinals; Ukraine has five fighters in medal round, and there are four from Kazakhstan, three from Uzbekistan and one each from Georgia and Azerbaijan; Cuba has six semifinalists and United States has four; photo (M)</p>

        <p>They come from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Ukraine and Russia, burly, hard-looking men who fight with a relentless, intractable boxing style. On the 12th day of the 2000 Olympic boxing tournament, in a headstrong, straight-ahead march through the quarterfinals, it was the fighters from the countries formed by the breakup of the Soviet Union that imposed a new pecking order on the competition.</p>
        <p>The once invincible Cuban boxers lost four consecutive quarterfinal bouts and the Americans, demoralized a day earlier, got back into the medal hunt with three fighters -- Ricardo Juarez, Ricardo Williams Jr., and Jermain Taylor -- advancing. But when the day ended, with the semifinals set in 12 weight classes, the talk was no longer of the rivalry between the United States and Cuba, it was about the widespread improvement in fighters from nations that had once fought under one federation.</p>
        <p>''It used to be you had one guy from the Soviet Union to get past in each division,'' Tom Mustin, the United States boxing coach, said. ''Now, realistically, there's four or five of them from what used to be the Soviet Union. And they're all good. Real good.''</p>
        <p>At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, fighters from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan won one gold medal each. Cuba won four gold medals and three silver. The United States won one gold medal and four bronze medals.</p>
        <p>At the Sydney Games, Russia has placed seven fighters in the semifinals, more than any other country. Five fighters from Ukraine have advanced to the medal round as well, four from Kazakhstan, three from Uzbekistan and one each from Georgia and Azerbaijan.</p>
        <p>Cuba has six semifinalists and the United States has four, including bantamweight Clarence Vinson, who will face Cuba's Guillermo Rigondeaux Thursday night.</p>
        <p>Since both losing fighters in the semifinals receive bronze medals, that means the countries from the former Soviet Union are assured of winning 21 boxing medals at this year's Olympics.</p>
        <p>''Those guys are brawlers and they're extra strong,'' Mustin said. ''They probably do a lot of weight lifting and neck exercises because punches don't seem to affect them. They walk through them and keep hitting you.''</p>
        <p>Mustin plans to get some head-to-head competition with Russia or Kazakhstan in the coming non-Olympic years.</p>
        <p>''We need to bring those guys in for some dual meets,'' he said. ''They are also fighting rougher, more pushing and shoving and pulling a guy's head down. And we've got to get used to that, learn some of that. In U.S. amateur boxing, we fight relatively clean. But you can see in these fights, they're letting more of that go. We've got to adapt.''</p>
        <p>It was a good day for Mustin's team, something the United States fighters needed after their team captain, Michael Bennett, was eliminated by Cuba's heavyweight, Felix Savon, on Tuesday. Middleweight Jeff Lacy was also soundly beaten on the same day.</p>
        <p>The biggest United States victory today came from Juarez, a featherweight who defeated Somluck Kamsing of Thailand, a gold medalist in Atlanta. Juarez, a reigning world champion, was behind on points by 11-9, midway through the third round.</p>
        <p>But Juarez unleashed a 10-second flurry of punches, chasing Kamsing from the center of the ring to the ropes and keeping him there where he landed eight unanswered punches. The fight was stopped in the fourth round because Juarez was ahead by 15 points, 31-16. In the Olympics, fights are stopped if one boxer is behind by 15 points.</p>
        <p>Kamsing was 6 inches taller than the 5-foot-3-inch, 125-pound Juarez, and had about 1,000 Thailand fans rooting for him at the boxing site.</p>
        <p>''It was a tough situation,'' Juarez said. ''But I'm pretty tough, too. I don't worry about taller opponents, at my height, everyone is taller.''</p>
        <p>Taylor, meanwhile, predicted he would win the middleweight division after his convincing 19-14 victory over Germany's Adnan Catic.</p>
        <p>''I'm going all the way,'' Taylor said. ''I'm going to win the gold medal, I feel it.''</p>
        <p>Taylor was expected to have to face Cuba's Juan Hernandez in the next round. But Hernandez, a world champion  who had several commanding victories in the last two weeks, lost to Yermakhan Ibraimov of Kazakhstan.</p>
        <p>Williams will face Cuba's Diogenes Luna in the welterweight semifinals. Luna won his quarterfinal today with a knockout, which is unusual in amateur boxing.</p>
        <p>''He can hit, but he also can be hit,'' Williams said of Luna. ''He takes a lot of punches and I'm going to feed him a lot of leather.''</p>
        <p>Williams was involved in a close fight with Russia's Leonov Alexandre when he outpointed Alexandre, 7-1, in the third round. Mustin calls Williams the United States team's most talented fighter because of his great footwork and quick hands. Williams, just 19, may need that quickness against Luna, a seasoned 23-year-old who has barreled through all of his opponents here.</p>
        <p>Luna was the lone Cuban fighter to win his bout today. Tuesday, Cuban fighters were undefeated in five fights. Besides Hernandez, Alexis Rubalcaba, Manuel Mantilla and Yosvany Aguilera also lost.</p>
        <p>Flyweight Jose Navarro was the lone American to lose today when he was defeated by France's Thomas Jerome on points, 23-12. Navarro fell behind in the third round, and desperate for a comeback, left himself open for even more punches. ''I tried, but he was scoring more and more,'' Navarro said. ''I'm going to try to mature from this. I did the best I could.''</p>
