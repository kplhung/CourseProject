        <p>Sports of The Times by Harvey Araton on Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge, longtime Australian tennis doubles team, winner of many medals, but loser in this year's quest for gold at Olympics; team is breaking up after 10 years; photo (M)</p>

        <p>THEY have been known as the Woodies, the Australian doubles of doubles, though they look nothing alike, hardly play alike and have based themselves on opposite coasts of the United States. They formed a partnership 10 years ago, when Mark Woodforde was 25 and Todd Woodbridge was turning 20. Sixty-one tournament titles, 11 of them Grand Slams, and 1 Olympic gold medal later, they walked on court here yesterday afternoon to thunderous applause, the final chapter to a storybook all but set in print.</p>

        <p>THEY have been known as the Woodies, the Australian doubles of doubles, though they look nothing alike, hardly play alike and have based themselves on opposite coasts of the United States. They formed a partnership 10 years ago, when Mark Woodforde was 25 and Todd Woodbridge was turning 20. Sixty-one tournament titles, 11 of them Grand Slams, and 1 Olympic gold medal later, they walked on court here yesterday afternoon to thunderous applause, the final chapter to a storybook all but set in print.</p>
        <p>Woodforde, the redhaired southpaw, had planned or fantasized it this way, the gold medal match on Australian soil. He was tired of the grind, the road, the raw-boned teenagers with the hunger in their eyes. He and his American-born wife were expecting a baby after New Year's. He had to tell Woodbridge, the brown-haired right-hander, that he was coming to the end.</p>
        <p>Think about it, he had said one night, as they picked at dinner, as the red wine flowed. He, Woodforde, had been around long enough to have played championship doubles with Martina Navratilova, with John McEnroe, who faded off the circuit as the 1980's closed and left Woodforde looking for a second. He had preferred a right-hander, a more natural complement, and an Australian, a more desirable companion.</p>
        <p>Had they been best friends? Hard to say, they said. Difficult to define the relationship because it wasn't as if they went on golf holidays, or sightseeing tours. It was enough to spend years jetting to distant outposts and urban centers, practicing on the side courts, playing the matches. ''When you stepped off the court,'' Woodforde said, ''you tended to separate.''</p>
        <p>They had had a substandard year in 1999, and started to hear people imply that their formula for success, whatever it was, no longer worked. They were proud of their record, of being part of the great Australian tennis history, of being the Woodies. They rededicated themselves for one more run, one last emotional ride, all the way to the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>Woodforde broke down after they won the French Open, the one elusive Grand Slam, last June. When they carried the momentum on to London and won Wimbledon for a sixth time, he went back to the hotel and sobbed some more. He said he was all cried out by the time yesterday's gold medal match against Canada's Daniel Nestor and Sebastien Lareau came around because it just felt right, for both players, when they really thought about how far they had gone, how they now could finish at home. ''I told someone before we went on court that today was going to be good or really great,'' Woodbridge said.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, they both had pregnant wives watching from the stands. They had a crowd of about 10,000, mostly Australians who truly believed that Venus Williams's victory in the women's gold medal match over Elena Dementieva was the junior varsity game. They sang ''Waltzing Matilda'' and swayed to a mantra of ''Aus-sies . . . Aus-sies.'' They chanted ''Let's Go Woodies,'' and sang, ''If you really love the Woodies clap your hands.''</p>
        <p>Everyone loved their chance for gold after they won the first set, breaking Lareau's serve three times. But the late afternoon clouds rolled in and as the day turned gray, the crowd's energy level took a precipitous drop. Three-of-five-set doubles does not create the climactic surge of, say, Cathy Freeman in the 400 meters. It didn't help when the Canadians took the second set and began to look like the snappier team.</p>
        <p>Lareau had raised his level after the first set while Nestor, a lanky left-hander, was playing so well, better than the Woodies had ever seen him, it occurred to Woodbridge that Nestor might be a potential partner if his oral agreement doesn't work out with the Swede Jonas Bjorkman. The Canadians took the third set, forced a fourth-set tie breaker and didn't even have to strike a gold-medal clinching shot. Woodbridge double-faulted on match point, putting the punctuation on the 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (2) defeat and one of the best doubles teams in the history of the sport.</p>
        <p>They hugged in the service box, before going to the net. Woodforde didn't cry this time. His wife, Erin, did, but that was when her husband was stepping up to the medal stand to have the silver slipped around his neck, and again when the Woodies walked off to one last ovation, arms around each other's shoulder.</p>
        <p>As they say here, they had given it a go.</p>
        <p>''This doesn't change what the results were, what our legacy is,'' said Woodforde, the good Aussie, the gracious loser. ''Our partnership will always be gold.''</p>
        <p>He is committed to play the Davis Cup final in Spain, without Woodbridge, who was not selected for the team. Woodforde sighed and said, ''I kind of wish today was my last match, with Todd.''</p>
        <p>Woodbridge was the more emotional one this time, wiping away tears and saying he was just happy that the Woodies had played their last match together in Australia, at the Olympics, and not ''some small tournament in some remote corner of the world.''</p>
        <p>It was home, where the heart is, where Geoff Pollard of Tennis Australia could thank them at their news conference for a decade of success, for their 1996 gold medal in Atlanta and for silver this last time.</p>
        <p>''You have become icons in Australian sport and deservedly so,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Thanks, mate,'' a blushing Mark Woodforde said. ''Thanks.''</p>
