        <p>Suffering from midcentury-modern fatigue? Nightmares of being chased through the Seagram Building by a giant Egg chair? Go to Brooklyn, or rather, Breukelen. After four years of selling  cutting-edge contemporary home furnishings on Atlantic Avenue, John Erik and his partner, Thomas Gibson, opened a second Breukelen, at 68 Gansevoort Street in Manhattan. Same stuff, but closer to customers who covet names like Bodo Sperlein and Burning Relic as if they were Eames and Nelson. ''To me it seemed more of a challenge to go out and chose from all-current product and pick out things that don't have a pedigree,'' said Mr. Erik, above, in front of a panel of flannel from the 40's. He is too diplomatic to suggest that purveyors of old-modern -- as opposed to modern-modern -- are passe. After all, they're his friends, and he digs Verner Panton as much as the next Parsons industrial-design grad. But he'd rather seek out New Zealand shag rugs that look like sea anemones (bottom far right, $55 a square foot), a floor lamp made from globes of Venini glass (below center, $2,200) or sconces from the German-born, London-based Mr. Sperlein (right, $950 each) fabricated from a porcelain used in the medical industry. ''We're crazy about porcelain,'' Mr. Erik said.</p>
        <p>Breukelen's overall palette is ''earthy and warm,'' he said. There isn't much primary-color pop, with exceptions like the Dove Tusai red resin place-mat setting (right, $55 each) accompanying Mr. Sperlein's line of bone china and his pieces and lamps for the Nymphenburg porcelain factory. The steel dining table ($5,200) is from a New York designer, David Khouri. Burning Relic's steel bed (right, $7,000) is set off by brightly colored Danskina rugs from the Netherlands ($65 a square foot).</p>

        <p>In October, Breukelen will mount a Burning Relic show, and next year, at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair, one devoted to Gabriela Valenzuela, who works in New York and Costa Rica. Her use of almond and black genizaro woods in chairs and dining tables (neither shown) could be from 1950 or 2050 -- but happens to be halfway between. Breukelen: (212) 645-2216.</p>
