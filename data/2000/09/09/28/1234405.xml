        <p>A deputy commissioner for the city's Buildings Department has been indicted on charges that he accepted gifts, including wine and Rangers tickets, and did not report them on official government disclosure forms, a lawyer familiar with the case said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The deputy commissioner for operations and administration at the Buildings Department, Barry G. Cox, is one of several people indicted in an investigation conducted by the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, and expected to be announced today, the lawyer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox is one of the department's most powerful officials, overseeing the centralized inspection unit that handles high-profile cases.</p>
        <p>He also oversees the department's budget, fiscal operations, customer service, human resources, labor relations, information systems and training.</p>
        <p>Officials in Mr. Morgenthau's office declined to discuss the specifics of the indictments or to confirm any person named in them, but acknowledged that their prosecution had resulted from an ongoing investigation conducted by the office's rackets bureau.</p>
        <p>That bureau now has a construction industry task force pursuing a wide range of possible wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox has been charged with four misdemeanor counts of accepting the gifts and one felony count of failing to report the gifts, the lawyer involved in the case said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox's lawyer, John L. Pollok, said, ''It would be inappropriate for me to comment, but I am sure that my client will be fully vindicated.''</p>
        <p>A person who answered the telephone at Mr. Cox's house declined to respond to questions from a reporter.</p>
        <p>George Arzt, a friend of Mr. Cox's who worked with him during the Koch administration, called the indictment ''penny-ante stuff that represents a lapse in judgment but does not rise to a criminal indictment.''</p>
