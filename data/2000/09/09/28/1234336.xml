        <p>In Alaska, health care officials found that the best way to get children enrolled in a federal health insurance program was to give their parents information encased in an imitation caribou-skin tote bag. Louisiana had a tireless advocate for the program, and made things easy for parents by giving them stamped self-addressed envelopes to return their applications.</p>
        <p>In Arizona, the Legislature forbade groups to try to enroll people through the public schools, and the state has lagged behind dozens of others in the number of children it has insured. California is the among the worst states in enrollment; a 27-page application was just one of many problems there.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Congress provided $4.2 billion to the states to provide health insurance for the millions of children whose parents were too poor to afford commercial plans  but who made too much to qualify for Medicaid. Now, a majority of the states are in danger of forfeiting their shares of the federal money, because they have not been able to get their versions of the program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, up and running.</p>
        <p>But what separates those states that have managed to enroll children into health insurance programs from those that did not in many ways defies convenient leaps of logic and, in many cases, the expectations of experts of the program.</p>
        <p>Geography did not dictate the outcome. Often states that failed miserably adjoined states with highly successful programs. Nor did the difference always prove to be related to partisan politics.</p>
        <p>And while states that have fared best often share a few crucial factors -- like a person or group obsessed with getting the plan rolled out, or simpler application forms -- just as often it was an odd legislative twist of fate that determined whether or not the program was a success.</p>
        <p>''All of this just shows how weird policy can be,'' said Rhea Williams-Bishop, a coordinator in the South for the Children's Defense Fund. ''Putting it in place and implementing it are really two different things, and one quirky event can really change the situation.''</p>
        <p>Leaders in some 40 states that are in danger of losing federal financing for the program said they were simply not able to find enough children to enroll, or argued that when they tried to ferret out children, they found many who were eligible for Medicaid and enrolled them in that program instead. But it is also clear that some states made a much more concerted effort early on.</p>
        <p>Alaska was never expected to be among such states. Experts did not expect a rural state, with a large Native American population and broad swaths of hard-to-travel land, to set any records in enrollment.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, Alaska was among the top six states in signing up uninsured children, according to figures from the Children's Defense Fund, which has closely monitored enrollment. Like many other states, Alaska chose to expand its Medicaid program with the new federal money rather than to start a new program from scratch. But it packaged it in a whole new way.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to create a program that didn't feel like government,'' said Karen Pearson, the deputy director of the division of public health in the state's health department.</p>
        <p>The program got a very private-insurance sounding name -- Denali KidCare -- named after the mountain. The state hired a marketing expert, rather than telling a totally inexperienced state employee to create advertising, as many states have done. The move resulted in a snappy advertising campaign distributed where potential beneficiaries actually lived.</p>
        <p>Many new staff members were hired, in part to shave away at the entrenched Medicaid culture -- one that discourages people from signing up for benefits rather than recruiting them, Ms. Pearson said. And the state quickly teamed up with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, which runs Native American hospitals, to reach out to those potential enrollees. Incentives were put together that were ethnically specific, like the imitation caribou tote bags.</p>
        <p>So far, the state has enrolled 38,980 children, 20,000 above its expectations. Sherry Gutierrez, who supports three children in Fairbanks on about $1,800 a month, said she was thrilled with the program.</p>
        <p>''There were some years that I was eligible for public assistance but I stayed away from getting it because it seemed like a lot of the health care professionals treated you badly,'' Ms. Gutierrez said. ''I didn't want my kids to feel that. With Denali, they treat it much more like health insurance.''</p>
        <p>Another fairly rural state, with a large Indian population and among the highest number of uninsured children, is Arizona, where the insurance program has gone quite another way. The biggest barrier there, pediatricians, advocates and government officials agreed, were a few powerful state legislators who opposed the program, calling it federal interference, in spite of strong support from the governor and the public.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the measure was killed in the Legislature, only to be revived in a quick special session with one caveat that has kept enrollment figures low: the state could not give contracts to public schools to enroll students, one of the most successful methods of recruitment.</p>
        <p>''That had a chilling effect,'' said Frank Lopez, a spokesman for the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. ''School districts were hesitant to do anything in our outreach efforts.''</p>
        <p>Efforts to overturn the ban have been unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>''I think citizens around the state have tried to do enrollment, and the state has made a reasonable effort to simplify the process,'' said Carol Kamin, executive director of the Children's Action Alliance of Arizona, an advocacy group. ''But the bottom line is that in order to do outreach, you have got to go to where the kids are, and schools are, after all, where they are.''</p>
        <p>One of the most successful programs in the nation is in New York, where a state program that predated the federal one became a model for other states, and where the state often recruits in schools.</p>
        <p>Eva Then of Washington Heights in Manhattan signed up when she came to register one of her three children for school, and saw the Children's Aid Society handing out fliers.  She had already been through three efforts to wind her way through the Medicaid application procedure. ''I came home and told my mother I couldn't believe they gave my children insurance because it was too easy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In Arizona, State Senator Russell Bowers, a major proponent of the ban on school outreach, defended his position, saying: ''I feel schools are for education. I am not interested in contracting for health care in schools.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowers, a Republican, acknowledged that his position was hugely unpopular, even in his own district, but he said, ''If the whole state wanted to do something and I felt it was wrong, I still would vote no.''</p>
        <p>To generate opposition, someone sent fliers around the state insisting that federal health insurance for children would require that sixth-grade girls have pelvic examinations.</p>
        <p>Those same fliers were also distributed throughout Texas, where a few opponents of the program in the Legislature also slowed the program's start. The number of uninsured children in Texas is among the nation's highest.</p>
        <p>''We had a tough fight trying to get a good plan,'' said Carl Rush, chief operating officer of Family Health Foundation in San Antonio. ''There are elements who think this is the thin edge of the wedge of socialized medicine.''</p>
        <p>It did not help matters that the Texas Legislature meets once every two years and had just adjourned in 1997 after Congress passed the measure. Other states had similar calendar problems.</p>
        <p>States that turned over much of the enrollment process to community-based groups also tended to do best.</p>
        <p>Texas, California and some other states were dogged by fears among legal immigrants that their status would be challenged if they accepted a public program. This was especially true in California.</p>
