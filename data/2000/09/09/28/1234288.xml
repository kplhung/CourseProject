        <p>Hortencia, their greatest player ever, was at home, retired. Janeth Arcain, the best player they have here, had fouled out. What remained of the Brazilians' storied women's basketball tradition and team limped out on the court with less than two minutes left in tonight's game, trailing Russia by 3 points.</p>
        <p>''For so long, this team does not show the spirit of other Brazil teams,'' guard Adriana Pinto said. ''We had to show the spirit to make everyone see we still have a very good team.''</p>
        <p>In the most pulsating game of the Olympic tournament, the undermanned Brazilians got an offensive rebound with 15 seconds left and worked the ball to their 6-foot-6 center, Alessandra Oliveira. Between two defenders, Oliveira banked in a three-foot shot off the glass with 1.4 seconds left to give Brazil a 68-67 victory over Russia in the quarterfinals before a loud gathering of 14,381 at the Super Dome in Olympic Park.</p>
        <p>Brazil's electrifying victory came hours before the United States, the defending champion, defeated Slovakia, 58-43, in another quarterfinal. Lisa Leslie scored 18 points as Team USA advanced to face South Korea, which beat France,  68-59, in Friday night's semifinals here.  Brazil will face Australia, which beat Poland, 76-48, in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>The Brazilians are headed to the semifinals with renewed confidence. After falling behind by 3 points with 1:45 remaining tonight, Brazil retook the lead and dodged controversy and a last-second heave to advance.</p>
        <p>Confusion reigned after Oliveira's layup inside. The Brazilian coach, Antonio Carlos Barbosa, paraded out to midcourt to meet his players, joyously celebrating and apparently thinking the game was over. Meanwhile, Russia called for a timeout it did not have. In international play, that does not result in a technical foul, as it does under college and pro rules in the United States. The Russians were merely told to inbound the ball and begin play.</p>
        <p>Instead of calling a technical foul on Barbosa for coming onto the court, the officials were distracted by Russia's timeout situation.</p>
        <p>''Actually, I went to meet my players because I wanted to bring them very quickly to the bench to talk with them,'' Barbosa explained, saying he believed the Russians had called time.</p>
        <p>On the inbound play, a full-court lob was caught by Irina Routkovskaia on the left wing, and she almost converted a wild, off-balance shot off the glass.</p>
        <p>When no buzzer sounded, both teams kept scrambling for the ball. Shades of the Munich Games in 1972: the timekeeper had not started the clock. A few seconds later, the officials ended the game as the Brazilian players mobbed the floor and nearly tackled Oliveira.</p>
        <p>Oliveira finished with 17 points, while the backcourt tandem of Adriana Santos and Helen Cristina Luz combined for 21 points and 6 assists. Arcain, who plays for the Women's National Basketball Association champion Houston Comets, was limited to 22 minutes because of foul problems and finished with 13 points and 9 rebounds.</p>
        <p>In the opening quarterfinal, Lauren Jackson's 17 points, 9 rebounds, 6 blocked shots and 3 assists led Australia's rout of Poland. The Aussies held the 7-foot Polish center, Malgorzata Dydek, to 12 points and forced her into 5 turnovers.</p>
        <p>Slovakia actually made a game of it in the first half against the United States, cutting the Americans' lead to 29-23 before Ruthie Bolton-Holifield banked in a 3-pointer before halftime to widen the margin to 32-23. It was the lowest-scoring game ever for the United States women in the Olympics.</p>
