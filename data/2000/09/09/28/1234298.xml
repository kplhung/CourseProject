        <p>The composer Ernst Krenek wrote his one-act chamber opera ''What Price Confidence?'' in 1945 for four singers from the Metropolitan Opera who wanted an adventurous work that could be performed with piano in concert settings.

        <p>The composer Ernst Krenek wrote his one-act chamber opera ''What Price Confidence?'' in 1945 for four singers from the Metropolitan Opera who wanted an adventurous work that could be performed with piano in concert settings. At the time Krenek, who was born in Vienna in 1900 and fled Nazi Germany for the United States in 1938, was still the famous composer of the 1927 opera ''Jonny Spielt Auf.'' With its jazz-influenced score and daring plot about a black musician and his white girlfriend, that genre-blurring work had been acclaimed, debated and denounced in productions around the world. So there should have been considerable interest in ''What Price Confidence?''</p>
        <p>But the singers who commissioned it never found the time to study the piece. Or so they told Krenek. More likely they were put off by Krenek's bleakly satirical English libretto and challenging 12-tone score. He had to wait until 1962 for a premiere production in Germany, for which he  translated the text into German.</p>
        <p>This intriguing 45-minute opera finally received its New York premiere on Thursday night at the intimate Theater of Riverside Church in Morningside Heights. The production is being sponsored by Elysium: Between Two Continents, an organization that presents works that intersect American and European cultures, which ''What Price Confidence?'' clearly does.</p>
        <p>The story, which Krenek thought of after reading Melville's ''Confidence Man,'' concerns two well-off couples in late-Victorian London who test each other's confidence. Edwin, introspective and a bit dull, is suspicious when his vivacious wife, Gloria, sets off for yet another afternoon tea. His distrust, she artfully argues, stems from his lack of confidence in himself, not in her.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile in another part of town Richard, a dapper businessman, tells his meek wife, Vivian, that he must go to another urgent directors' meeting. Vivian is not a bit worried, she says unconvincingly, because she has such confidence in herself. By the end the couples have swapped partners and totally lost their confidence in the value of confidence.</p>
        <p>That this droll, Brechtian libretto is set to a 12-tone score might seem stylistically incongruous. Not at all. While adhering to the technique, Krenek's music has constant variety, rhythmic elasticity and harmonic punch. The vocal lines closely follow the natural flow of the words without seeming like endless recitative.</p>
        <p>No doubt some listeners will not hear humor in Krenek's score, since the dissonant 12-tone idiom has become so associated with angst. But there is wit in Krenek's use of overly industrious counterpoint, intentionally lugubrious lyricism and other touches. And his spiky harmonic language certainly captures the neuroses of these self-deluded characters.</p>
        <p>The spare production, directed by Gregorij H. von Leitis, uses proper period costumes and suggests different rooms and locales with just a few hanging drapes. The musical director, John W. Simmons, played the piano score fluently. The young and able cast included Joshua Parrillo, a bass-baritone, as Edwin; Julia Koci, a soprano, as Gloria; Christopher Pfund, a tenor, as Richard; and Anne Duraski, a mezzo-soprano, as Vivian. The Vienna-born Ms. Koci, the only non-American, had trouble projecting the English words clearly, though a tremulous quality in her voice may have also been a factor.</p>
        <p>. This fascinating little opera is  given an effective performance that lacks only a final level of, well, confidence. That could come, as the production runs through Saturday.</p>
