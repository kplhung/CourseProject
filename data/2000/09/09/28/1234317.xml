        <p>Tab Ramos sat on the floor, not moving, his eyes ringed with red, his uniform still on well after the end of the match. Clint Mathis simply stared into space, not responding to questions from reporters. Coach Octavio Zambrano sat, head down, quiet, finally saying, ''I just don't know what happened.''</p>
        <p>That was how the Chicago Fire's 3-0 victory on Tuesday night in the Major League Soccer playoff semifinals left the MetroStars. In that match's wake, the MetroStars were disorganized, demoralized and beginning to point fingers at one another.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we had the right team on the field,'' Lothar Matthaus said. ''I don't think we can beat them with the team we had tonight.''</p>
        <p>And Mike Petke said: ''We had a huge gap in midfield. No one was running back to cover.'' The forwards, he said, have to cover.</p>
        <p>''We've been successful playing our game, and we played our game tonight,'' Ramos said after the match, ''but we didn't put our chances away, and we were the worse for it.''</p>
        <p>Whatever that game plan was, the Fire manhandled the MetroStars, blowing by them on the flanks despite losing its captain, Peter Novak, to injury, and effortlessly setting off counterattacks. Goalkeeper Paul Grafer was shelled repeatedly by Fire forwards Ante Razov and Hristo Stoitchkov, and when the MetroStars finally began to push forward late in the second half, all Chicago had to do was loop the ball over the defenders to take the pressure off.</p>
        <p>Now, the MetroStars are at a crucial juncture: trailing by 3 points to 0, a tie at home Saturday night would keep them alive in the series (the winner will be the first team that gets to 5 points). A victory would set up the deciding match, which is scheduled for Oct. 6 in Chicago. The winner of the series will advance to M.L.S. Cup Oct. 15 in Washington. But the MetroStars seemed flummoxed by the Fire, a deep, strong team that has been criticized in the league for its tough style of play.</p>
        <p>Petke says the key to Saturday's game is pressure. ''The teams that foul the most win the most,'' he said.</p>
