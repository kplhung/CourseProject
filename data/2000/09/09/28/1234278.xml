        <p>THE GOLDEN AGE  By Gore Vidal  467 pages. Doubleday. $27.5O.</p>
        <p>Thirty-three years after he began his series of interlocking historical novels with ''Washington, D.C.,'' Gore Vidal has done something curious: revisited the characters and events of that first installment with a perspective now altered by age and time.</p>
        <p>In ''The Golden Age,'' the seventh and concluding installment (the others are ''Burr,'' ''Lincoln,'' ''1976,'' ''Empire'' and ''Hollywood''), Mr. Vidal returns to World War II and the McCarthy era. He reimagines the ambitions and schemes of the same fictitious people. And he veers so close to the narrative of ''Washington, D.C.'' that both books even conclude with the same valedictory passage, one that equates the fall of a republic or the rise of an empire with the activities of bacteria on a microscope's slide.</p>
        <p>That's nice, but Mr. Vidal isn't actually one for false modesty, national or otherwise. In a postscript, he maintains that he was right about Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings in ''Burr'' and that he's right about Franklin D. Roosevelt's complicity in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The latter, along with the advent of the nuclear age, the Truman Doctrine, the military-industrial complex, rampant anti-Communism and the Korean War, is one of the main historical matters to be dissected, gossiped and speculated about here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal's emphasis has changed, to the point where the fictional characters who made a sharp-clawed story out of ''Washington, D.C.'' have receded to the background. After all, they're older now, and the author has already put most of them through the wringer. Unfortunately, a forest of loose ends still dangle from their past histories, and the most recent book, ''Hollywood'' (set in the 1920's), is 10 years old.</p>
        <p>So there is much page-clogging explaining to be done, along the order of ''While Frederika dozed, Blaise went into the men's section of the pool house, where Peter had observed his sister, Enid, being made love to by Clay Overbury, now her husband, as well as aide to Senator James Burden Day, whose daughter, Diana, was becoming, more and more, the center of Peter's daydreams.'' As Burr himself might have said to Jefferson (in a series where ascribing made-up dialogue to real historical figures is standard practice), ''Whew.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Vidal's interest this time is less concentrated on his characters' private vicissitudes. Like Orson Welles, who of course turns up in a heavily name-dropping story that begins in 1939, he is interested in deep focus. So the series' familiar figures, like the aging former actress, newspaper publisher and illegitimate Burr descendant Caroline Sanford Sanford (see a previous volume to learn why she married her cousin), are integrated into an ambitious historical tableau. In practical terms, that means that Caroline is a houseguest at the White House while Franklin D. Roosevelt charts his course around America's isolationists, and that another character is on hand to watch H. L. Mencken, Walter Lippman, Joseph Alsop, Drew Pearson and Walter Winchell cover the 1940 Republican National Convention. The nominee, Wendell Willkie, is also acquainted with Mr. Vidal's fictitious characters and is enthusiastically analyzed by one and all.</p>
        <p>Coincidentally, ''The Golden Age'' spans the same time period (1939-54) that is captured far more zestily by another current cameo-filled novel, Michael Chabon's ''Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay.'' Both authors bring on assorted famous faces and signs of the times, but Mr. Vidal's don't often escape the confines of a literary puppet show. Politicians walk into the story, unburden themselves of speechy position-paper dialogue or elaborate self-justifications, and then disappear. Even though, as Mr. Vidal points out in his postscript, he actually knew many of the people he writes about, the book's politicians sound like refugees from a different kind of dissertation on midcentury American history.</p>
        <p>Cultural figures come alive more successfully, especially those to whom Mr. Vidal can comfortably ascribe intimate banter. And even Parker Tyler, the scarily intense film critic who loomed large in the author's ''Myra Breckinridge,'' shows up. Through Peter Sanford, an observer and writer who is Mr. Vidal's contemporary, the book gets a glimpse of Marlon Brando in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' (two of Peter's friends find the play ''a total realignment of the sexes''), meets the divine Dawn Powell (who bristles at Hemingway's inflated reputation) and hears Paul Bowles's catty assessment of Leonard Bernstein.  ''This is a new world, isn't it?'' says Peter, acknowledging the creative homosexual culture that Mr. Vidal evokes with affection. ''Or the old world,'' a friend tells him, ''better understood.''</p>
        <p>It should surprise no one that the tangential figure who is most memorably summoned here is Mr. Vidal himself, in the midst of enjoying a golden age of his own. The book postulates that the years between 1945 and 1950 were a hurricane's eye of promise and peacetime between World War II and the cold war. They were also the years in which the author made his auspicious arrival on the literary scene with ''Williwaw'' (1946) and especially ''The City and the Pillar'' (1948), and he glides into the proceedings with winking assurance. ''My mother insists that Gore writes just like Shakespeare,'' says one character at a party. And with this, ''Vidal shook his head sadly. 'I could never manage those rhyming couplets at the end of scenes.' ''</p>
        <p>In a surprisingly deft and eloquent grace note to this true magnum opus, Mr. Vidal suddenly fades forward to the millennium, gliding past the success of his currently revived 1960 play ''The Best Man'' and away to his home in Ravello, Italy, in a condition that he characterizes as ''ancient.'' He takes over the role of first-person narrator, holds forth on such present-day forces of historical change as the Internet, and otherwise contemplates a world of change. He settles some last scores and offers a final assessment of Roosevelt's shrewdness: ''I admired him quite as much as I deplored him.''  And he engages in a conversation with Peter, who refers to this novel's version of Truman.</p>
        <p>''You made him up,'' says Peter. ''Then you made me up, too. How does it feel to play god?'' This much is clear at the end of Mr. Vidal's huge, defining seven-book undertaking: he knows the answer.</p>
