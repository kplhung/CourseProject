        <p>In another effort to bring together Internet and traditional retailing, a company named in Los Angeles is introducing a series of prepaid cards to be sold in retail stores that enable the card holders to buy merchandise on the Web sites of e-commerce companies. J. Michael Boh, chief executive at Prepay.com, described the cards as a cost-effective method for dot-coms to acquire customers as they ''search for ways offline to drive people online.'' The cards can be used like gift certificates, entitling the users to buy merchandise on the Web sites of dot-coms like Aboutgolf.com, Beautyscene.com and Cigar.com. Mr. Boh said Prepay.com would begin national sales of the cards through large retail chains in late October.</p>
