        <p>Lady luck was riding high on Anthony Napoleon's shoulder when he arrived at Yankee Stadium yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>Like hundreds of other Yankees fans, he was there to buy the first playoff tickets to go on sale. He got a blue lottery wristband. It broke. He could have left, but he asked for another one. It read 555211.</p>
        <p>At 10:30 a.m., an announcer began calling out the order of ticket buyers. Guess what the first number was.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Napoleon's luck might confirm suspicions about the ticket-selling process, almost two hours later, his good fortune flew away with the speed of a Nolan Ryan fastball. Two plainclothes police officers standing nearby glanced over at Mr. Napoleon, 42, first in line and wearing a green Yankees cap. They looked more closely. There were warrants out for his arrest on charges of ticket scalping, failing to appear in court, public drinking and possession of a fake pistol, the police said.</p>
        <p>''A known scalper,'' they said.</p>
        <p>So instead of getting playoff tickets, Mr. Napoleon got a free ride to central booking.</p>
        <p>About 600 people showed up yesterday morning to buy tickets that went for anywhere from $12 (bleachers) to $45 (box). Scalpers have been known to sell Yankees tickets for as much as $1,000. People were lined up well before 8 a.m., when the first wristbands were distributed.</p>
        <p>Many people took the day off from work to stand in line. (For Mr. Napoleon, this was work, the police said.) Jason Zillo, a spokesman for the Yankees, said he did not understand why they did this. Didn't they know that you could buy tickets at www.yankees.com? Couldn't they pick up the telephone and dial Ticketmaster?</p>
        <p>But if people wanted to wait in line, that was their right.</p>
        <p>''Since we started making the playoffs in 1995, this system has been there,'' Mr. Zillo said. ''It works and we'll keep using it. If it's not broke, don't fix it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Napoleon could have bought his tickets on the Internet or over the telephone. But he showed up in person. After the two officers spotted him and escorted him into the stadium, they came back out and asked who had the next number. A big man wearing a blue Yankees shirt and cap stepped up and held up a wristband with 555213.</p>
        <p>His name was Chris Geiger. He had no idea what had just happened, and he grinned as his tickets were handed to him. Then he called his friend on his cell phone. He had bought the first tickets of the day.</p>
