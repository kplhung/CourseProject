        <p>In a move that would advance its lead in the business of storage and maintenance facilities for company's Web sites, Exodus Communications is close to acquiring the Web host division of Global Crossing for about $6.5 billion in stock, people close to the companies said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Both companies' boards planned to meet to discuss the complex transaction, which would potentially make Global Crossing, the operator of a global fiber optic communications network, the largest shareholder in Exodus.</p>
        <p>Although most points of the transaction have been agreed upon by the two companies' management, it is not yet clear whether a definitive agreement will be reached. Talks on a similar deal collapsed in July.</p>
        <p>Within the cutthroat Web host business, the potential transaction signals further consolidation. Similar to other parts of the telecommunications industry, it is increasingly a business of size and scale in which smaller companies are priced out of contracts by large competitors.</p>
        <p>''Size is everything because a larger Web-hosting company can offer a larger array of services at lower cost,'' said Fred Moran, an analyst at Jefferies &amp; Company. ''Exodus is at the head of the pack, but it must have been feeling the heat lately.''</p>
        <p>Exodus and Global Crossing may have felt pressure to pursue a deal after WorldCom acquired Intermedia Communications for about $6 billion in stock and debt earlier this month, giving WorldCom control of Digex Inc., another large manager of Web sites. Intermedia rejected offers from Exodus and Global Crossing before accepting WorldCom's bid.</p>
        <p>Under the transaction being discussed by Exodus and Global Crossing, Exodus would issue new shares valued at approximately $6.5 billion to pay for Global Center, Global Crossing's Web site host unit. Effectively, this would give Global Crossing a 20 percent stake in Exodus, making it the company's largest shareholder, people close to the companies said.</p>
        <p>In addition, in a part of the transaction potentially worth billions of dollars, Exodus would designate Global Crossing as its primary network carrier for 10 years, committing to buy at least half of its network needs from the company, which is based in Hamilton, Bermuda.</p>
        <p>And in Asia, Exodus and Global Crossing would form a separate venture with Asia Global Crossing, a company controlled by Global Crossing with partners including Microsoft and Softbank of Japan. Exodus would control two-thirds and Global Crossing one-third of the venture, people close to the companies said.</p>
        <p>For Global Crossing, the deal would help save about $1 billion needed to build out its own network of data centers where clients store their Internet servers in vaults. The relatively dim prospects in the short term for a public offering of shares in its Global Center unit may also have contributed to its eagerness for a deal.</p>
        <p>For Exodus, of Santa Clara, Calif., the transaction would allow the company to have guaranteed access to Global Crossing's network instead of seeking out capacity on the networks of other companies.</p>
        <p>Exodus has more than 2.3 million square feet of Web host space at more than 20 centers across the country, where clients like Yahoo and eBay store their servers on racks in vaults.</p>
