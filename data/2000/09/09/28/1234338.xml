        <p>Denmark, pursuing an odd calling as the barometer of Europe's mood, holds its fourth referendum in less than a decade on Thursday on what degree of integration with the European Union the country desires.</p>
        <p>This time, the question being put to just over four million voters is whether Denmark should follow 12 other states of the 15-member Union and join a shared European currency, the euro. But the real issue may be summed up otherwise: it's the politics, stupid.</p>
        <p>The Danish currency, the krone, is pegged to the euro and has followed the currency's 25 percent slide against the dollar during the past 21 months. This link will be maintained whatever the outcome of the vote.</p>
        <p>But even if this arrangement ties Denmark irrevocably to Europe's economic fate, many Danes are concerned about adopting a currency they see as a political symbol of a push for a European superstate in which the identity of small nations like Denmark would be diminished.</p>
        <p>''Countries should have their own borders, their own defense and their own currency, but all of this is being eroded by attempts to create a United States of Europe,'' said Peter Skaarup, a member of the right-wing Danish People's Party. ''If we give up the krone, we won't be masters in our own house any more.''</p>
        <p>Such fears have bolstered the ''No'' campaign, and most opinion polls suggest that Danes will reject the euro. The vote, however, is too close to call, with at least 10 percent of the electorate undecided, and the government of Social Democratic Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is placing its faith in a last-minute swing in favor of the euro.</p>
        <p>Other European governments will be watching closely. The euro's weakness since its introduction in 1999 has been tied partly to a market perception that the will does not exist in the European Union to pursue the sort of political integration that would bolster the currency.</p>
        <p>A Danish rejection would inevitably reinforce such sentiments at a time when the European Central Bank, with support from the United States and Japan, has already felt obliged to intervene in support of the currency. Any prospect of Britain and Sweden adopting the euro would also recede.</p>
        <p>A Gallup poll published today showed 47 percent of Danes against the euro and 41 percent in favor. A poll by the National Statistics Office gave the anti-euro camp an even wider victory, with 51.7 percent voting ''No'' and 41.3 percent ''Yes.'' Only one survey, by the Vilstrup polling center, gave a narrow victory to euro supporters.</p>
        <p>Jorn Thulstrup, a pollster who has followed the national mood closely and was predicting a month ago that Denmark would accept the euro, said he had now reluctantly concluded that the country would reject it.</p>
        <p>Fears about pensions reflect anxiety among Danes that joining the euro would open the way to outside domination in the form of an insistence that Denmark cut its  taxes, scale back its welfare state and deregulate its economy along the lines that markets generally favor.</p>
        <p>Many Danish Socialists continue to oppose the euro on the grounds that it would prove incompatible with their welfare state. As a result, the left and right have come to oppose the euro for different reasons.</p>
        <p>''We are facing an unholy alliance of right-wing nationalists concerned about our identity and left-wingers worried about economic freedom,'' said John Iversen, a spokesman for the Social Democratic Party.</p>
