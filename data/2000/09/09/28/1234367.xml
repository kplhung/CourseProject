        <p>The wrestling behemoths stood side by side during introductions, displaying two distinct versions of 286-pound physiques. On the left was the lean and sculptured Siberian with the Ray Nitschke snarl and a seat in the Russian parliament. On the right, with his hands clasped before him, was a hefty slab of prime Wyoming beef who looked like a shy kid with too much baby fat.</p>
        <p>Rulon Gardner knows how his roundish 29-year-old frame appears. ''Yeah, people make fun of me, like I ate a little kid and he's in my chest,'' Gardner said.</p>
        <p>You would not know it, but that enormous 54-inch chest guards a pair of lungs that the Three Tenors would kill the Fat Lady for, a deep reservoir of aerobic strength that would be his weapon of endurance against his opponent, Aleksandr Karelin, the emperor of Greco-Roman wrestling.</p>
        <p>And in one of the most startling upsets in Olympic wrestling history, Gardner defeated Karelin, 1-0, in overtime of the 130-kilogram (286-pound) final, blocking Karelin's attempted march to a fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal.</p>
        <p>Karelin, known as the ''World's Meanest Man'' and ''The Experiment,'' had never lost in international competition, and had not lost at all since 1987.</p>
        <p>That loss was to a Soviet wrestler, back when there was a Soviet Union, a still-standing Berlin Wall and a cold war. For sheer surprise, Gardner's victory over such an overwhelming favorite may rival the United States hockey team's upset of the Soviet team at the 1980 Winter Games.</p>
        <p>Gardner, a first-time Olympian, said he felt unusually calm as he faced Karelin, who had defeated him in 1997. When Karelin was starting his 13-year unbeaten streak, Gardner was milking cows, baling hay and shoving rocks on his family's struggling dairy farm in tiny Afton, Wyo. (population 1,394), completely unaware of the terror of Karelin's signature reverse body lift. It was not until 1992 that Gardner said he had even heard of a mighty Russian wrestler with Herculean strength but did not know his name. By 1995, Gardner knew who he was. By then, Karelin had won gold at the Seoul and Barcelona Games.</p>
        <p>There was not a single, unbroken path to wrestling for Gardner. At the University of Nebraska, he was the lineman who got away from Coach Tom Osborne. Had Osborne matched the size of his wrestling scholarship, Gardner might be fending off Jevon Kearse, not grappling with a vision of monstrous Siberian perfection.</p>
        <p>Now they were on a stage in Australia, in an exposition hall packed with fans, including Henry A. Kissinger and Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee.</p>
        <p>And Karelin was expected to fling Gardner, best known for winning two Pan American championships, about the yellow and red mat like a helpless mammal and return to Novosibirsk with his fourth gold.</p>
        <p>But after nine minutes of competition, there was Gardner exulting with a somersault and a cartwheel. He had beaten Karelin by never letting the Siberian toss him, turn him, take him down or flip him on his head. Karelin was incapable of getting a firm or lasting grip on the elusive Gardner, as if Gardner were slathered in mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>In a form of wrestling in which the legs cannot be used for any maneuvers, they pushed and poked each other relentlessly, but Karelin failed to gain an advantage even when grabbing Gardner's shaved head in his big mitts. Nothing worked. Karelin lifted Gardner twice, but Gardner's bulkiness, that huge chest, that center of gravity, kept him grounded. In Greco-Roman wrestling, holds are not permitted below the waist.</p>
        <p>Then the Big Man made a mistake. At the start of the second three-minute round, Karelin was in a clinch with Gardner when the Russian inadvertently released his lock, an automatic point to his opponent. Gardner's coaches roared to the referee, who did not initially make the call. The clock stopped, the three officials conferred and gave Gardner the only point he needed.</p>
        <p>''I worked on that almost every day in practice,'' Gardner said. ''In the semis, I lost a point in a clinch. I have no idea why he broke the clinch. I knew he broke it, but I thought he was going to throw me and I thought: 'Oh, no. What if the tape doesn't show he broke the clinch?' ''</p>
        <p>Gardner compared battling Karelin to moving a reluctant horse where it does not want to go. But no, he amended the thought. A cow, not a horse.</p>
        <p>''If you get a chance,'' he said, ''go up against a cow and push it. Just experience pushing a cow, to get her to move where you need her, and that's what he's like. Only he's a bit quicker. No, a lot quicker.''</p>
        <p>But maybe Karelin was tired after two matches today. Even Goliath's knees start creaking. A Russian journalist joked that Karelin, also a tax officer, may have been distracted by his duties in the lower house of the Duma, Russia's parliament.</p>
        <p>Karelin took his loss with class, placing his right hand on his heart to acknowledge the fans simultaneously roaring in amazement that he had lost while saluting his former invincibility. Then he disappeared without a word. For Gardner, there was plenty to say, though, and plenty of support. His parents, Reed and Virginia, four sisters and three brothers were there. They and seven more members of the Gardner family had scraped together the money to stand by Rulon.</p>
        <p>As his son cheerfully and skillfully schmoozed with a scrum of reporters almost as large as Afton's population, Reed stood apart, an American flag draped from his left shoulder down to his waist. He held it in place with his left hand. Reed Gardner talked about hard times on the farm, of living year to year, ''struggling to stay alive and hope next year will be better.''</p>
        <p>All the kids have left the farm, save Rulon, who runs it now while his father helps out. The father remembered when Rulon, the youngest of his nine children (one son died of aplastic anemia), was chubby and quiet and easy for other boys to tease.</p>
        <p>Reed Gardner said that his son's one defeat by Karelin three years ago was a whupping to build on, an indelible memory of frightening strength. Certainly, Karelin was not an abiding obsession, as he was to Matt Ghaffari, the effusive Iranian-born United States wrestler who lost the Olympic gold medal match to Karelin in 1996.</p>
        <p>''As far as Aleksandr Karelin intimidating Rulon,'' Reed Gardner said, ''I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>You wonder what went through Karelin's mind when he knew he was going to lose, when it was apparent that Gardner was not one more victim. There was Gardner, keeping Karelin at bay with his impregnable defense. Had he sensed Karelin backing off, surrendering, in the waning moments? Yes, he said, but said he had to be ready ''for one last explosion.''</p>
        <p>But somewhere in those final seconds, he said, Karelin mumbled something in Russian. ''I think,'' Rulon Gardner said, ''it was basically, 'I give up.' ''</p>
