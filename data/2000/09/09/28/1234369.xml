        <p>The loudspeakers stood like black monoliths on the sidelines of the Giants' practice field today, substitutes for the harsh atmosphere the team expects to face Sunday against the Titans at Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Pumping in crowd noise is an old trick meant to force the offense to call plays above the din. But the Giants will have more to overcome than audio interference.</p>
        <p>The Giants' 16-6 loss to the Washington Redskins last Sunday dropped them from the undefeated ranks. A loss this weekend would further deflate the 3-0 start the Giants enjoyed a week ago and may crack their confidence, even though today the players were quick to note that no one in the locker room was panicking.</p>
        <p>They did acknowledge, however, that Sunday's game should be telling of just how much the Giants have grown from seasons past.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to let one loss get us down,'' Tiki Barber said. ''We want this team to be good enough and prepared and have pride that we can be good through the tough times. It's all great and dandy when you're 3-0, but you lose a game, then all of a sudden the air gets taken out a little bit. You still want to fight through the tough times because that's what builds character. That's what wins championships. You have to develop it. Fortunately for us, we get to develop it early in the season.''</p>
        <p>To do that, the Giants must get past the defending American Football Conference champions and win at Adelphia Coliseum, which no opponent has done. The Titans are 9-0 in the two-year-old stadium, tying the National Football League record for most victories to open a new stadium.</p>
        <p>Adelphia has quickly become one of the N.F.L.'s louder stadiums. Last season St. Louis tried unsuccessfully to use electronic earplugs to drown out all noise except for quarterback Kurt Warner's voice.</p>
        <p>Giants center Dusty Zeigler, a former Buffalo Bills player, called last season's A.F.C. wild-card game at Adelphia ''the loudest game I ever played.'' Of course, he has other, more troubling memories of that January day.</p>
        <p>Standing on the sideline after a field goal gave the Bills a 16-15 lead with 16 seconds left, Zeigler watched in horror as the Titans' Kevin Dyson took a lateral on the ensuing kickoff and returned it 75 yards for the winning touchdown with three seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>''On the sidelines, we were all watching and we were all talking about what we're going to do the next week, how we're going to celebrate, what a good time everyone's going to have,'' Zeigler said today. ''It was like a gunshot, and 10 guys fell down on the sideline.''</p>
        <p>Giants linebacker Mike Barrow has friends on the Titans and was at that Bills game last season.</p>
        <p>''We have to start making plays,'' Barrow said. ''That's the only antidote to keep the crowd quiet.''</p>
        <p>The game could come down to how the Giants handle the Titans' vaunted defense. The Giants blamed themselves for most of their offensive problems Sunday, saying their ineffectiveness on first downs put them in long-yardage situations they were unable to convert.</p>
        <p>The Titans may have the best defense the Giants face all season. Tennessee is ranked first against the pass in the A.F.C. Then there is the looming problem of Titans defensive end Jevon Kearse.</p>
        <p>The Giants' new offensive line struggled for the first time Sunday and now it must handle the second-year star Kearse, who has 12.5 sacks in his last 11 games.</p>
        <p>But the Giants' defense, with the notable exception of its battered secondary, held its own against the Redskins. The Giants are ranked first against the run and allowed Redskins running back Stephen Davis only 89 yards on 30 carries, a stingy 3.0 average.</p>
        <p>The Titans are built to run and are undefeated in the last 14 regular-season games when running back Eddie George carries at least 27 times. But George is averaging only 2.9 yards a carry this season.</p>
        <p>Among the eight Titans questionable for Sunday's game are wide receiver Yancey Thigpen (hamstring) and tight end Frank Wycheck (concussion), a two-time Pro Bowl selection who led Tennessee in receptions the last four seasons. Coach Jeff Fisher said Wycheck's condition had not improved since Tuesday.</p>
        <p>As for the quarterback situation, Fisher said he would pick a starter by Friday.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Neil O'Donnell left the game with a strained neck after being sacked. But Steve McNair, who began the season as the starter, stepped in and rallied the Titans to victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers. And he did so without reinjuring his bruised sternum.</p>
        <p>Thus, Giants Coach Jim Fassel expects McNair to start.</p>
