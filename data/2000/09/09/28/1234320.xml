        <p>In a concession to nations seeking to soften restrictions on Iraq, the Clinton administration agreed today to reduce the amount of money being set aside to compensate victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The money saved from the compensation fund would be used for relief projects for Iraqis.</p>
        <p>In return, Russia and France will allow a disputed reparations claim of $15.9 billion to be paid to the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.</p>
        <p>The consensus agreement, to go into effect in December, is to be announced on Thursday at a meeting of the Iraq compensation commission. The deal allows Washington to avoid a showdown vote in the commission that would further divide the Security Council's permanent members, with the United States and Britain on one side and France, Russia and possibly China on the other.</p>
        <p>The Iraqi compensation commission has the same membership as the 15-nation Security Council, where the United States has lost broad support for its overall Iraq policy and is now seeing it being whittled away on several fronts.</p>
        <p>Some United Nations officials and diplomats in Geneva, where the commission is based, say that the United States had the votes to win the battle on the Kuwait claim, as American diplomats were predicting it would. But both sides decided to go for a political compromise instead.</p>
        <p>''We were willing to go to a vote if we had to,'' said Ambassador James B. Cunningham, deputy chief representative of the United States here and the envoy who handles the Iraq issue in the Security Council. ''But this is one of the remaining processes that works well that was set up under the sanctions and compensation regime. Going to a vote after a long period of taking decisions by consensus would in a way open up the process to a spirit of contention that hasn't existed up until now.''</p>
        <p>Decisions in the commission have been made by experts in international law, Mr. Cunningham said in an interview, adding that the panel ''should just get on doing its work without dragging in the political differences that we know we have.''</p>
        <p>Since the oil-sales program went into effect in 1996, 30 percent of the money Iraq makes from its supervised exports has been earmarked for reparations, and more than $8 billion has been paid in claims. Under the agreement today, the money set aside will be reduced to 25 percent in December, when a new phase of the ''oil for food'' program begins. The level will be reviewed again in six months.</p>
        <p>Until 1995 Iraq rejected the oil-sales plan, and the only money available for reparations was in Iraqi funds frozen abroad, most of them inaccessible.</p>
        <p>Because of high oil prices and the removal last year of all restrictions on how much oil Iraq can sell, there is now much more money available to the fund.</p>
        <p>Russia and France had objected to the payment of large claims to Kuwait while Iraqi civilians were still suffering the effects of sanctions. Under the agreement today, money saved from the reduction in the compensation commission's share will be funneled into relief or rehabilitation projects for Iraq, an American diplomat said. The specific nature of the projects is still to be determined.</p>
        <p>The deal was struck just as more nations prepared to send flights to Baghdad in contravention of a longstanding air embargo on Iraq. Today Jordan became the first Arab country in more than a decade to send a passenger airliner to Baghdad's newly reopened airport. Iceland has approved a flight, and France and Russia plan to send more planes after initial flights over the last two weeks. India is also thinking of joining the movement to force open the skies over Iraq.</p>
        <p>For most of these flights, including the one from Jordan, governments have followed the rules and notified the Security Council, saying that the intention is to deliver relief goods, which are permitted to enter Iraq with Council approval. But the notification process has been reduced to something of a fiction in recent days, with multiple flights carrying avowedly antisanctions delegations.</p>
