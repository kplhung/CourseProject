        <p>THE News Corporation and Liberty Media Group confirmed yesterday that they had agreed to a complex stock and asset swap in which Liberty Media would increase its stake in the News Corporation and the News Corporation would pick up Liberty's Gemstar-TV Guide International holdings.</p>
        <p>Gemstar-TV Guide provides electronic program guides like VCR Plus and develops and licenses proprietary technologies primarily for consumers. It also owns TV Guide and TV Guide Online.</p>
        <p>Ed Hatch, who follows the News Corporation and Liberty Media for SG Cowen, said he liked the deal because it should help the News Corporation  rapidly deploy the programming guides on the digital satellite platforms that it is consolidating around the world. That strategy, he said, should ultimately enhance the value of both the News Corporation and Liberty, which will own a stake in the business after it is spun off.</p>
        <p>However, one analyst who requested anonymity was less enthusiastic, saying that the News Corporation was effectively paying a high price for Liberty's 21 percent stake in Gemstar. The addition would increase its total interest to 43 percent. Much of Gemstar's value, the analyst said, is in patents that have yet to be tested.</p>
        <p>Rupert Murdoch, chairman of the News Corporation, is intent on moving ahead with the purchase, some analysts said, because it would strengthen his hand in a bid for General Motor's Hughes Electronics unit. Hughes owns DirecTV, the satellite TV service. The News Corporation is planning to spin off Sky Global Networks, its big international satellite operation for pay TV, Internet and data services and is interested in adding a United States satellite business to it.</p>
        <p>The deal is strategically important now because it helps put a valuation on Sky Global of about $38 billion shortly before its public offering, which is expected to take place by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Liberty would swap roughly 86.5 million shares of Gemstar. At yesterday's closing price of $72.94, the value of the shares would total about $6.3 billion. Liberty would also contribute some of its interest in South American cable businesses worth around $400 million.</p>
        <p>In exchange, the company would receive 121.5 million nonvoting News Corporation American depository receipts. They closed yesterday at $47.38, for a total value of $5.79 billion. That stake represents 80 percent of the payment the News Corporation plans to make, giving the entire Gemstar stock purchase a value of around $7.2 billion. Liberty's chairman, John C. Malone, has agreed to take the balance in Sky Global stock worth $1.4 billion. And Liberty will get roughly $400 million in additional Sky Global stock in exchange for the South American cable businesses.</p>
        <p>Liberty will, therefore, receive a total of $1.8 billion in the satellite business's stock. The News Corporation said yesterday that Liberty's total payment in Sky Global stock would equal 4.8 percent of Sky Global's total value, giving the business a total value of about $38 billion.</p>
        <p>Liberty also agreed to buy $500 million of Sky Global stock in the initial public offering.</p>
        <p>Shares of the companies involved in the deal all rose yesterday. Gemstar was up $4.38 at $72.94;  the News Corporation's regular American depository receipts climbed $2.69, to $56.50; and Liberty Media closed up 50 cents at $18.88.</p>
        <p>Liberty, which is a tracking stock of AT&amp;T, is a collection of programming assets that Mr. Malone assembled as he was building his cable empire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatch of SG Cowan said two-thirds of the value of Liberty Media was in publicly traded equities, many of which have dramatically declined in the past 52 weeks. Liberty's holdings in Sprint-PCS, for example, has sunk to $7 billion from its high of $14 billion last March.</p>
        <p>Liberty also has interest in Liberty Digital, which had a value of $16 billion last January but which has since sunk to about $4 billion. Its stake in Time Warner Inc., which had been worth as much as $12 billion, is now worth $9 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatch said Liberty also had stakes in private cable programming companies like Discovery Communications, owner of the Discovery, Learning and other cable TV channels. Investors have been concerned about the impact of advertiser spending on revenues.</p>
        <p>The swap of its holdings in Gemstar, whose stock price has soared over the past year, does little to immediately enhance Liberty's value. But Mr. Malone was apparently eager to increase Liberty's stake in the News Corporation from 6 percent to roughly 18 percent of the company. That stake would make him the largest holder of nonvoting shares. It would not, however, give him voting rights or a seat on the board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch said in a conference call yesterday that he would like to have Mr. Malone on the board. But Mr. Malone's powerful role at AT&amp;T might be a barrier.</p>
        <p>Liberty is effectively controlled by AT&amp;T, and regulators could take issue with Mr. Malone sitting on the board of AT&amp;T, now one of the nation's largest cable operators, as well as on the board of the News Corporation, the parent of Sky Global, which has a competing direct-to-home satellite service.</p>
