        <p>They couldn't quite place the name. There was something slightly familiar about the photo. As for naming their favorite Barbra Streisand song, forget it.</p>
        <p>It is safe to say, the students at Erasmus Hall High School, the alma mater of the famous Brooklyn girl who made good, were not among those clamoring to fork over up to $2,500 to see the first of her New York shows at Madison Square Garden, which has been billed as Ms. Streisand's last round of concerts.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Streisand's portrait (with permed hair, circa ''Yentl'') is part of a hallway mural celebrating the school's bicentennial in 1987, Jennifer Lino, 15, and Karla Moncayo, 14, froze behind their hot fudge sundaes when asked if they knew who she was, and looked awfully like they were trying to avoid being called on in class.</p>
        <p>''Who? Who's that?'' asked Stacey Wright.</p>
        <p>Jacqueline William knew. ''Barbra Streisand, that lady, with the funny nose,'' she told her fellow freshmen. ''She sings.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know who y'all talking about,'' Crystal Ulett said.</p>
        <p>Jacqueline tried again. ''She's white. With the gold hair.'' She did not mention the 26 platinum albums, 2 Oscars or 8 Grammy awards.</p>
        <p>A photograph was produced. ''You know her face from somewhere, right?'' Jacqueline said.</p>
        <p>Stacey peered at it, and harumphed.</p>
        <p>At the Garden last night, there was a good deal more excitement. One woman showed her shaking hands to a television reporter. She offered to sing ''Papa'' for the evening news, but broke off nervously, suddenly forgetting the words.</p>
        <p>Two couples, the Turners and the Margetts, paid $475 for each ticket and flew in from Derbyshire, England, for the concert. They almost hired a limousine, said Marlaine Margetts, until they realized that their hotel, the Pennsylvania, was right across the street from the Garden.</p>
        <p>Robin and Victor Nekrasovas and Gloria and Steve Salmanowitz came from Monroe, N.J. The ladies did not care that their $225 tickets weren't so good. ''We're sitting in Queens, actually,'' Mrs. Nekrasovas said. '' 'Evergreen' is my wedding song.''</p>
        <p>But the men were less enthusiastic. ''If somebody comes up and offers me $1,000,'' said Mr. Salmanowitz, ''they can have my ticket. I'm going to Nathan's.''</p>
        <p>Ron Gubernot, 51, had surprised Evan Myron, 41, with tickets for their 20th anniversary. Mr. Myron knew what to expect, down to the set list. ''I'm a Barbra person,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Everyone said they loved Barbra. For some people, tickets were a dream come true. But Peter A. Ciarlo of Middlebury, Conn., said he was just making his wife, Debbie, happy.</p>
        <p>''My husband loves the way she sings, but he doesn't love her politics,'' Mrs. Ciarlo said of the singer, who is known to support many liberal causes.</p>
        <p>Back in Flatbush, Jacqueline William had an idea how to help Ms. Streisand raise her profile. Ms. Streisand, she said, should come back to her old high school. ''Mariah Carey found time to go back to her old school,'' Jacqueline said. (Ms. Streisand did give Erasmus $25,000 in 1994, one of the principals, Carolyn Wagner, said later.)</p>
        <p>But if Ms. Streisand did pay a visit to Erasmus, would anyone recognize her? Karim Smith, 15, thought he knew who she was. ''She was in that one with the three witches? The thing on the Disney Channel?''</p>
        <p>Um. Maybe he meant Cher.</p>
        <p>Antoine McFadden, 15, mustered a guess. ''Titanic?''</p>
        <p>Michael Garcia, 18, knew precisely. ''That lady with the big nose? She got married and the wedding was private, and nobody could go to it?''</p>
        <p>Guests at the concert last night included Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Christie Brinkley,  the model, and Rosie O'Donnell, the talk show host. Many of those who clutched tickets, like Sue Booker of Walsall, England, whose husband had surprised her with tickets last Sunday, had never seen the legend perform live before.</p>
        <p>Ms. Streisand did not strike out everywhere in Brooklyn. ''I like her, she's a nice girl,'' said Sydney Adams, 45, as he shaved sugarcane with a knife on the corner of Church and Flatbush Avenues.</p>
        <p>Nearby, a man selling CD's on a folding table said he had sold out of Streisand albums just that morning. ''I only had three,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Stacey Williams, 23, pulled her gospel-blaring earphones out of her ears to talk while she was on her way to work at a day care center. Yes, she nodded, she had a Streisand album. ''The one with the Jewish song on it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At Erasmus, Ebony Hogue, a sophomore in the school's humanities and performing arts program, refused to be daunted by her lack of familiarity with the superstar. ''You know her?'' said the teenager. ''You could hook me up with her.''</p>
