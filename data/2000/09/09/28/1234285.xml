        <p>AT first glance, the scene at MTV's Times Square studio last week was familiar to anyone who has ever watched even a few minutes of the channel.

        <p>AT first glance, the scene at MTV's Times Square studio last week was familiar to anyone who has ever watched even a few minutes of the channel. There was music, dancers, D.J.'s, guest appearances and, of course, music videos. But the show that was being rehearsed, a live, hourlong hip-hop music show called ''Direct Effect,'' may be anything but typical. Its producers say that it offers a glimpse into the near future of television for all viewers, even those who can't hold a beat in a basket.</p>
        <p>What primarily distinguishes ''Direct Effect'' from regular television fare is that viewers not only watch it but also help direct it through computers wired to MTV.com. They can help select -- interacting in real time -- what music videos will be featured on the show.</p>
        <p>''This is perfect for our audience,'' said Sara R. Cohen, vice president for programming at MTV.com. She described MTV's young core audience as being ''convergent people,'' as comfortable with their computers and cell phones as they are with their televisions.</p>
        <p>Once logged on to MTV.com, viewers can follow a link to ''Direct Effect,'' where they will find three thumbnail pictures and descriptions of the artists and videos.</p>
        <p>To vote for the next video to be played on the show, viewers click once on a spot under the description of the video. The vote is sent to the network's control room in New York, where it is rapidly tabulated with others. A running tally of the vote is posted on the live television screen almost up to the last minute before the next video is shown.</p>
        <p>''I think the presence of this sort of show is really reassuring,'' said Todd Boyd, a professor at the University of Southern California's School of Cinema and Television and an expert on hip-hop culture, ''especially when you hear so much about the 'digital divide' and large numbers of black people and minorities being left out of the digital revolution.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, when you consider how increasingly comfortable young people, all kinds of young people, are with cutting-edge, computer-based technologies like computer games and digital music, ''it's not surprising that we have reached a point where the connection of television and the Internet is so direct.''</p>
        <p>Even without a computer, what viewers see on their television screens is a blend of old-fashioned television dating back to the days of ''American Bandstand'' and the original ''Soul Train'' and Web-inspired multiple screens and banner text. In some instances as many as five screens may compete at once for the viewer's attention.</p>
        <p>MTV producers and executives said that they are encouraged by their own studies of their audience.</p>
        <p>''Our audience demonstrates that it is very willing to participate in multiscreen programs here and now,'' said Nicholas Butterworth, president and chief executive of MTVi, the interactive arm of MTV Networks.</p>
        <p>As high-speed, broadband Internet service is slowly proliferating the United States, television and Internet executives are increasingly promising that PC-smart, set-top boxes will soon start transforming television, making much of it interactive. Brian Graden, president of programming for MTV, said his viewers were not willing to wait.</p>
        <p>''Our audience is probably not like any other,'' Mr. Graden said. ''About 70 percent of them have computers and TV in the same room and use them at the same time. They have come up with a crude two-box solution to interactivity.''</p>
        <p>The MTV Networks/Viacom Study of Media, Entertainment and Leisure Time found last summer that there has been a significant swell in the number of people owning and using personal computers in their homes. But the study also showed that television is not losing its audience to the Internet. Instead, the two media are co-existing.</p>
        <p>''Rather than making trade-offs between different media options, Americans are finding ways to incorporate new forms of media into their lives without sacrificing the things they already love,'' said Betsy Frank, executive vice president for research and planning at MTV Networks.</p>
        <p>In the end, she said, many people are multitasking, reflecting something she called ''behavioral convergence,'' which she defined as ''people acting as if their media platforms have already converged even though the technology isn't there yet.''</p>
        <p>The 24-year-old, fast-talking co-host of ''Direct Effect'' who calls himself Teck $ (pronounced ''money'') said he thought the show was making history, blending television and the Internet in an entertaining and useful way. And his appeal on the show fits right in because, he added with an enormous grin, ''most people see me as a computer game character anyway.''</p>
