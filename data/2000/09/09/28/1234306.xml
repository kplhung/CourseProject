        <p>AS an Englishman about to move to New York, Paul W. Thompson has a lot to think about. Where should he and his family live? Is it too late for his daughters to get into Spence? Oh, and what's to be done about reinventing the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum?</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Thompson was appointed the new director of the Cooper-Hewitt, a cultural organization housed in a flamboyant Fifth Avenue mansion at 2 East 91st Street. The Cooper-Hewitt is national design museum and archive, historical collection and graduate study program. Its exhibitions over the years have ranged from the hardly spine-tingling 1991 airing of ''The Cooper-Hewitt Collections: A Design Resource'' to the raucously interactive 1998 exhibition ''Unlimited by Design,'' an unprecedented review of universal design products.</p>
        <p>It is an institution that bears the awkward responsibility of tending vast, idiosyncratic holdings that include matchbooks, Soviet porcelain, shopping bags and the Tibor Kalman papers, while simultaneously trying to accommodate the demands of today's hyperactive design community longing for a mecca to call its own.</p>
        <p>''And then there's the whole name thing,'' Mr. Thompson said in a telephone interview from London as he pondered what awaits him at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum when he starts early next year. ''It's such a long name, maybe it needs shortening.''</p>
        <p>It will be a new leaf -- if not a whole new life -- for Mr. Thompson, 41, who will be leaving his post as director of the Design Museum in London, where he made a name for himself by paying off a nearly $2.2 million debt and keeping Sir Terence Conran, the museum's expansive founder, somewhat at bay. Chronically short of money, the Design Museum has relied heavily on importing exhibitions that originated elsewhere, including ''The Work of Charles and Ray Eames'' (which was initiated by the Library of Congress in partnership with the Vitra Design Museum and traveled to the Cooper-Hewitt) and ''The Life and Work of Buckminster Fuller'' (which came from Zurich). At the time of the museum's 10th anniversary last fall, Rowan Moore of The Evening Standard in London gave the museum three cheers, but then noted that ''it still doesn't quite fizz.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson was the first curator of one of the most popular permanent installations, called ''Review,'' a continuing display of the latest work coming out of London's design studios. His most ambitious recent offering was an exhibition this year on the Bauhaus that took advantage of materials that had only recently resurfaced in post-cold war Germany, including Walter Gropius's own office desk from Dessau.</p>
        <p>Discussing Mr. Thompson's eight years at the helm of the Design Museum, Sir Terence said, ''He's not a visionary.'' But he added that he ''will bring a professionalism'' to the job.</p>
        <p>The Cooper-Hewitt has also had to combine original exhibitions with more standardized fare. But it strove to be a pacesetter with increasing success in such shows as the intensely colorful ''Alexander Girard'' retrospective that opened this month and the recent ''Design Culture Now,'' a triennial presentation of breakthrough designs in architecture, graphics, fashion, landscape, new media and theater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, whose London friends describe him as consummately British -- dry humor, loud ties and all -- seemed less concerned about the next really big show than about the museum's identity. ''I need to work on it as a brand,'' he said, hesitating only briefly before lunging into full-throated marketing lingo. ''It needs to be contemporized -- what a horrible word,'' he said. ''Not enough people know about it. I have to concentrate on getting its brand really established.''</p>
        <p>As word of Mr. Thompson's appointment spread, the design community in New York offered their thoughts and ideas, both pragmatic and wistful, about the future of a museum that had been tended with missionary zeal by Dianne H. Pilgrim, who retired in January after being the museum's director for 12 years. Ms. Pilgrim happily allowed her curators to hammer home their themes when more subtle means would have sufficed. ''New York needs a museum that perpetually shows contemporary work,'' said Karim Rashid, the designer, who aims for high design at cheap prices. ''The Cooper-Hewitt is relatively steeped in the past, when it could be the epicenter of what's new. Let the Met do the old stuff.''</p>
        <p>The Cooper-Hewitt's core collection is indeed more than 100 years old, started by the three Hewitt sisters, granddaughters of the industrialist Peter Hewitt. That collection includes 19th-century textiles, drawings, prints and other collectibles befitting a Victorian stash. ''It's really two museums in one building,'' said Constantin Boym, who is known for using recycled and found objects to make household wares. He added that the new director must face the challenge of finding a connection between the applied arts of the 19th century and the problems of design as a cultural phenomenon now. ''The importance of the institution is growing at the same rate as design is becoming important in the economy and in the culture at large,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Echoing more than a few other New Yorkers, Mr. Boym said he dreamed of a Cooper-Hewitt that would be as actively involved as museums used to be in the 1920's and 30's, not only organizing exhibitions but also design competitions, housing studies and design awards. ''I want to see shows that aren't just reflections of what's happening, but catalysts to help things happen,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But it is the 1899 Cooper-Hewitt building itself, built by Andrew Carnegie and taken over by the museum in 1976, that comes under the most frequent fire as an almost impossible venue for staging exhibitions on modern design. It was a problem easily appreciated by visitors to the Eames show, as they were forced to make out the couple's radical experimental films projected in darkly paneled rooms, something like showing newsreels in a black hole.</p>
        <p>More than a few bystanders are suggesting, Why not divide the old from the new and move the more contemporary spirited exhibitions to a more flexible, dare we say hipper, location. ''It's a really heroic institution in a tough building,'' said Paola Antonelli, a design curator at the Museum of Modern Art, who said that early on in the process she turned down the chance to be considered for the director's job. Bifurcation, she worried, would impoverish an audience that needs to see design as it has evolved within its entire context.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, who now lives in a turn-of-the-century terrace house in West London (which he noted was ''like living in Brooklyn'') but works in a white cube on the south bank of the Thames designed by Conran Roche, seemed to have few qualms about the Cooper-Hewitt's present home. He soundly rejected any suggestion that he might be thinking of a move, or that he might be susceptible to the expansionitis infecting so many other museum directors. He did, however, allow that the garden at the Cooper-Hewitt looked very attractive. The land under it, that is.</p>
