        <p>After more than 30 years of marriage, Harriet Racenstein would still run to the phone when her husband, Martin, called to find out about her day as a high school guidance counselor.

        <p>After more than 30 years of marriage, Harriet Racenstein would still run to the phone when her husband, Martin, called to find out about her day as a high school guidance counselor. He would pin up photos of his wife at the office, and spoke often of her to his employees at a Manhattan window-cleaning supply company.</p>
        <p>But their life together ended violently last Saturday night, police officials said, when Mr. Racenstein, 60, bludgeoned his 59-year-old wife to death with a hammer in their town house in Ramapo Cirque, a wealthy gated community in Suffern, N.Y., and then took a fatal overdose of prescription medicine.</p>
        <p>The police said they discovered their bodies, lying together on a blood-stained floor in the bedroom, on Monday night after worried relatives had tried to reach them over the weekend.</p>
        <p>The murder-suicide has shocked many people in Suffern, a quiet village of 14,000 nestled at the foot of the Ramapo Mountains in western Rockland County. Friends and neighbors say they have been unable to reconcile their memories of the outwardly loving couple, who were childhood sweethearts, with the brutal crime.</p>
        <p>''It just doesn't fit the pattern,'' said Nathan Oberman, who lived across the street from the couple. ''To have something like this happen next door is absolutely shocking.''</p>
        <p>Bonnie McCarthy, chairwoman of the guidance department at Middletown High School in Orange County, worked with Mrs. Racenstein for 12 years. ''Nobody can believe it,'' she said. ''I thought he was terrific. I thought he was a loving, devoted husband; that is why this is such a shock.''</p>
        <p>Craig H. Long, a detective for the Suffern police, said no motive for the crime had been determined. He would not identify the prescription medicine Mr. Racenstein had taken or confirm whether he had been under a doctor's care, saying the case was still under investigation.</p>
        <p>But he said the police had found no signs of a break-in or a struggle at the Racensteins' three-story brick-and-wood house. Dr. Frederick T. Zugibe, chief medical examiner for Rockland County, said it appeared that Mrs. Racenstein, who was in her nightgown, had been attacked with repeated blows to her head while sleeping or lying down.</p>
        <p>Phone messages left yesterday at the homes of the Racensteins' three sons were not returned. A woman who said she was the wife of Mr. Racenstein's brother, Fred, answered the phone at their home in New Rochelle but would not comment. ''We're grieving,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Racensteins grew up together in Queens, married young and moved with their three sons to Spring Valley in Rockland more than 30 years ago, friends said. In the early 1990's, they bought the house in Ramapo Cirque, an enclave of 97 houses built on the former estate of Charles A. Pace, the lawyer who founded Pace University with his brother, Homer.</p>
        <p>The Racensteins loved travel, movies, plays and the ballet, and worshiped at the Monsey Jewish Center. They had recently taken up golf, and last year bought a retirement home near a golf course in Delray Beach, Fla. Friends said that the couple had returned last week from a trip there to celebrate Mr. Racenstein's birthday and the birth of a grandson in nearby Boca Raton.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Racenstein had counseled students for 12 years at Middletown High before retiring in June. Her co-workers said she loved to tell jokes and took a deeply personal interest in her students. Regina Drury, 26, a former student, tearfully recalled that Mrs. Racenstein had once driven her to a college interview and even put her up at her home that night. ''She was the person who pushed me to see that I could have a career for myself,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Other friends described Mrs. Racenstein as a spiritual woman who took classes at her synagogue for a belated bat mitzvah in her mid-50's. Many of her relatives and friends went to the service. ''It was just like a wedding; it was a wonderful day,'' said Debra Gershon, a neighbor who knew the Racensteins for 30 years. ''She had a strong Jewish identity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Racenstein had taken over a family business, J. Racenstein &amp; Co. at 224 West 30th Street in Manhattan, that was started in 1909 in his grandfather's apartment. The company has grown into a multimillion-dollar business that supplies window-cleaning equipment and chemicals to more than 25,000 customers around the world, said Bob Ertel, Mr. Racenstein's business partner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ertel said his partner was an energetic salesman who cultivated close relationships with their customers. When he was not on the phone with them, Mr. Racenstein often talked about his wife and family and even his golf game to his employees.</p>
        <p>''Oh, boy, did he like to talk a lot,'' Mr. Ertel said. ''Once he got started, he really went. His love for his wife was something you always heard about, how she was wonderful and fabulous.''</p>
        <p>After a moment's pause, Mr. Ertel cleared his throat. ''I still can't believe it,'' he said. ''I really thought that things were great. I thought they were happy.''</p>
