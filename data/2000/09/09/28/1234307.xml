        <p>ONE night this summer, Robert Smith was in a bar debating the name of an obscure supporting actress in an equally obscure John Wayne film. It was his telephone that finally settled the discussion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, however, didn't call anyone. Instead, using a minibrowser on his Samsung digital cell phone, he poked around the Web for about five minutes before finally uncovering the answer. ''I was amazed I could pull that off,'' he said later,  ''especially since I had $5 riding on the outcome.''</p>
        <p>But winning bar bets is low on the list of things that persuaded Mr. Smith to get wireless Web access. (About two months later, he couldn't even remember the name of the actress or the film involved in the bet.) Mr. Smith, a regional manager for a company that insures renters of everything from party tents to portable toilets, began using the wireless Web 11 months ago to tap into a Web-based database of his 1,200 clients without having to use a laptop computer.</p>
        <p>Media Metrix estimates that nearly 7.4 million households in the United States now have devices like cell phones, pagers and personal digital assistants that can pluck data from the airwaves. And although there are no reliable overall figures, people in the industry say that only a small percentage of users with Web-ready devices actually exploit that feature. Only 200,000 of Sprint PCS's customers have signed up for Web service. Similarly, AT&amp;T Wireless estimates that just 100,000 of its subscribers tap into the wireless Web.</p>
        <p>Those who do explore the wireless Web are discovering that it is a very different world from the Web they reach on desktop and laptop computers.  The content now available on the wireless Web -- mostly stock quotes, sports scores and weather forecasts -- is served up in basic text menus with a minimum of graphics and fanfare. In some ways, it is almost the opposite of the all-singing, all-dancing wired Web.</p>
        <p>''In focus groups, people say that they want full Web browsing, and that's the one thing we can't deliver,'' said Michael Mace, chief competitive officer at Palm Inc. ''We need to let people know that wireless is not like using a PC. When people who don't know that get there and try to browse, they say,  'What is this garbage?' ''</p>
        <p>But some others, like Mr. Smith, are even beginning to prefer the wireless version. He likens using his sleek, state-of-the-art Samsung phone to his early days of personal computing, when he was a proud owner of a boxy Kaypro.</p>
        <p>''What I find on the Web is too much junk,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Logos and graphics don't thrill me -- content does. But the wireless Web is like it was in the old days when we were tapping into bulletin boards with a 300-baud modem.''</p>
        <p>In a narrow sense, Mr. Smith isn't actually on the Web. While wireless users may think they're viewing the World Wide Web, many wireless providers in the United States, including AT&amp;T, limit their customers to special pages stored on closed servers. Some people in the wireless Web business predict the Web will become increasingly divided  into two streams, wired and wireless.</p>
        <p>''The Web is going to become highly segmented,'' said Andrew Sukawaty, the former president of Sprint PCS, the wireless company that counts Mr. Smith among its customers. ''You're going to see specialized pages for specialized needs''</p>
        <p>Exactly what Americans are doing on the wireless Web and what it may look like in five years remain something of a mystery. For starters, none of the major Net ratings companies has started tracking wireless Web use. And Bruce Ryon, vice president of Media Metrix's new-media group, which is developing such a measurement system, said that the widespread use of the wireless Web in Asia and Europe does not offer a model of what is likely to happen in the United States. In Europe, for example, online wireless games are popular. In Japan, there is a Web-based version of karaoke.</p>
        <p>American customers are not likely to be singing karaoke into their cell phones anytime soon. The biggest difference is cost. As with traditional phone service, there is a bewildering array of options for wireless Web customers, most of them more expensive than those in Europe or Japan. Sprint PCS, for example, estimates that its customers pay an average of 25 cents a minute to surf the Web.</p>
        <p>''The thing about Europe and Asia is that there's a whole different economic model,''  Mr. Ryon said. ''In both places it's very expensive to be wired to the Web. It can cost hundreds of dollars a month. But wireless access costs only a few dollars a month. Here, I have a Web cell phone that I'm paying about $70 a month for, and most people can get on the wired Internet practically for free.'' As a result, Mr. Ryon said, the relative expense of wireless browsing means that North Americans ''will not use it for time killing, like people in Europe.''</p>
        <p>Sprint PCS was the first United States wireless phone service to offer a practical way onto the Web using handheld gadgets. Most major wireless companies offer some form of Web service. Typically, they deliver text-only Web pages written in Handheld Device Mark-up Language -- H.D.M.L. -- or Wireless Mark-up Language -- W.M.L. In part, because wireless modems are sluggish -- most systems in this country reach a top speed of only 14.4 kilobits per second -- companies like AT&amp;T try to reduce delays by holding pages on closed servers and by using a series of technology standards known as the Wireless Application Protocol, or W.A.P.</p>
        <p>The content offered by the wireless Web also pales beside that of its wired cousin. Fast Web and Transfer, a search engine company, has indexed 400 million Web pages  from the traditional Web in its main search engine. But its W.A.P. search engine offers only 400,000 pages configured for the wireless Web.</p>
        <p>''This space is so new to all of us that we don't really know what services people will want on mobile devices,'' said Deanna Sanford, lead project manager for the mobile version of Microsoft's MSN Web portal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith is a good example of an early adopter of the wireless Web. Despite his phone's limitations, he has found a relatively sophisticated way to use it as he travels. Shortly after getting his new phone, Mr. Smith downloaded a wide variety of information about his clients -- contact information, policy expiration dates -- into a Web-based address book offered by Yahoo.</p>
        <p>''I use it to access my database when I don't have a laptop,'' he said, ''or during times like when I'm in a restaurant and I don't want to pull my laptop out and wait for it to boot up.''</p>
        <p>One thing Mr. Smith does not do, however, is stray outside of the roughly 40 sites offered by Sprint's wireless menu. Looking at pages not rewritten for Web phones usually involves scrolling through several screens containing only the text for the various navigation buttons and bars that surround the actual contents of a page when it is viewed on a personal computer.</p>
        <p>W.A.P. and its special standards are not the only answer to that problem. Palm Inc.  and others stick with traditional Web technical standards by using scraping or clipping software that tries to lift out only the most important text on a page. Other wireless-site developers are looking to create material aimed only at the wireless market. Lee Hancock, chief executive and chairman of Go2 Online, a Web-based business directory, said the company is altering and limiting the material it sends through its wireless Web service. ''You might not be looking for a plumber from your cell phone, but you might be looking for a hotel,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Go2 also hopes to take advantage of technology that will indicate future cell phones' physical locations (a feature that all phones sold in the United States after Oct. 1, 2001, must contain by law to aid 911 emergency operators) to automatically sort wireless Web pages. With that, the service would be able to deliver information on, say, restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the user.</p>
        <p>To no one's surprise, many companies are hoping that the wireless Web will become part of the world of e-commerce. The wireless Web versions of online stores like Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com are already being touted as comparison-shopping tools. The theory is that shoppers will pause in store aisles to check online prices before heading to the checkout.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ryon, at Media Metrix, has his doubts about the plan. ''I just kind of roll my eyes when it comes up at conferences,'' he said.  But he also said that future generations of Web-enabled phones might become part of another big Internet trend: downloadable music.</p>
        <p>As Web-enabled phones improve, Mr. Hancock said he expects that many users may even leave behind the wired Web, with its slow downloads and overwhelming multimedia features, just as many cell phone users have abadoned their land lines.</p>
        <p>''There is a very good chance that in many cases the wireless device becomes the primary entrance to the Web,'' Mr. Hancock said. ''But it will be very different than the Web as we now know it. We'll have to create a user experience I don't believe can be met by wired access.''</p>
        <p>Routes to Wireless Web</p>
        <p>Web-Enabled Cell Phones</p>
        <p>To reach the Web with a cell phone, users must first open a minibrowser that establishes a wireless connection with the Internet, usually through a special server. To save users the frustration of entering a Web address using the buttons on the telephone's numeric keypad, service providers usually present choices of text prompts on each phone's display.</p>
        <p>Some providers may limit some customers to specially designed wireless Web pages on the companies' own servers. Others let their customers view any Web pages. But the inability of cell phone screens to reproduce color or graphics means that Web sites written in special text-only languages are about all that is worth viewing. The pricing plans vary widely among cell phone companies.</p>
        <p>Pagers That Surf</p>
        <p>Pagers with tiny keyboards from Motorola and Research in Motion are primarily used to send and receive e-mail. But Research in Motion recently introduced a larger-screen model as a step toward linking its users to the Web as well.</p>
        <p>WolfeTech's Pocket Genie browser service (www.wolfetech  .com) offers owners of RIM's BlackBerry or Motorola's TimePort pager access to any Web page under plans that cost either $9.95 or $14.95 a month. The company's servers reformat pages for the tiny screens. Go America offers its Go.Web wireless service (www.goamerica.com) for pagers as well as P.D.A.'s and laptop computers with plans ranging from $9.95 to $59.95 a month. The company says its users can reach any Web page. Pages are compressed digitally before transmission.</p>
        <p>P.D.A.'s That Go Online</p>
        <p>Owners of Palm Inc.'s VII and VIIx models can subscribe to Palm.Net, a wireless service operated by the company, under plans that range from $9.99 a month plus additional-use charges to $44.99 a month for unlimited use. Palm's system, unlike those for cell phones, uses conventional Internet page language and offers about 400 sites that have been revised using what Palm calls Web clipping. To speed up downloading, that technology strips away graphics and links from Web pages. Palm.Net also offers services that will clip any page on the Web on demand, although the results can often be disappointing. Other wireless service providers also offer Web services that work with Palm, Windows CE and Pocket PC devices.</p>
