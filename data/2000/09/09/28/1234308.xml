        <p>Imagine upgrading your computer's operating system by simply popping out a CD-ROM and replacing it with a new one: No muss, no fuss, no scrambled software drivers and bald spots from pulling out hair.</p>
        <p>This is the idea behind a new kind of Internet appliance called the New Internet Computer, or N.I.C. The basic model is priced at $199 and is aimed at schools and consumers who would like to add Internet access around the house without nicking too much from the family budget.</p>

        <p>Imagine upgrading your computer's operating system by simply popping out a CD-ROM and replacing it with a new one: No muss, no fuss, no scrambled software drivers and bald spots from pulling out hair.</p>
        <p>This is the idea behind a new kind of Internet appliance called the New Internet Computer, or N.I.C. The basic model is priced at $199 and is aimed at schools and consumers who would like to add Internet access around the house without nicking too much from the family budget.</p>
        <p>Although it lacks an internal hard drive and isn't a full-fledged computer, the N.I.C. has enough hardware under the hood to make it more robust than a simplified Internet appliance. (It is made by the New Internet Computer Company, which was started by Larry Ellison, chief executive of the Oracle Corporation; Gina Smith, a former technology columnist and television host, is the New Internet Computer Company's chief executive.) Most Internet appliances will allow users to send e-mail only with the maker's designated provider and do basic Web browsing, but the N.I.C. allows the use of existing e-mail accounts and includes the latest version of Netscape Navigator and common browser plug-ins.</p>
        <p>Since it doesn't have a hard drive for storage, the N.I.C. will allow users to log on to shared application servers and do things like word processing over the Internet. The N.I.C.'s Linux-based operating system runs from a CD-ROM inside a computer with a 266-MHz Pentium-class processor, 64 megabytes of RAM and a 56-kilobits-per-second modem. The N.I.C. can also connect to the Internet with an Ethernet card and comes with two U.S.B. ports. The $199 computer doesn't come with a monitor, but a 15-inch display can be purchased from the company for $129 and everything is available at www.thinknic.com.</p>
        <p>While it may not be able to replace a regular desktop computer system, the N.I.C.'s lower price and its potential to free users from the technical support hot line make the middle ground look like an awfully nice place to explore.</p>
