        <p>On her fourth day as a teacher, Donna Moffett would not -- could not -- stop smiling.</p>
        <p>Never mind that only 8 of her 21 first graders had shown up on time to follow her, ducklinglike, from the schoolyard to her muggy second-floor classroom at Public School 92 in Brooklyn. Or that one little boy, with rumpled curls and a sullen gaze, rolled his eyes and disparaged her every move.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett, 45, peppy and crisp in a navy dress, forced herself to keep smiling, even when the 6-year-olds booed her choice of a second story to read out loud. Even when, as the children lined up for lunch, one of the more impulsive students dropped to the ground, attached herself to Ms. Moffett's ankles and shrieked.</p>
        <p>''We will be polite, show respect and use our inside voices,'' she said, reciting her newly minted class rules. ''We will work hard and come to class prepared.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett, who entered teaching on Sept. 7 with hardly any preparation at all, has a bumpy ride ahead. In July, she abandoned her comfortable longtime job as a legal secretary near Wall Street to be one of 320 ''teaching fellows'' -- people with little or no teaching experience, hired by Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy to fill chronic vacancies in New York City's most troubled public schools. In August, the fellows took a crash course in teaching and eight hours of certification exams.</p>
        <p>In these first weeks of school, Ms. Moffett is learning that teaching is only part of her job description -- for now, an achingly small part. She is already grappling with tardiness and discipline problems, often spending far more time on ''classroom management,'' as veteran teachers call it, than lessons. She is constantly imagining her students' lives outside the classroom and the myriad factors that may affect their academic performance, their energy levels, their moods. After school, sitting alone at her desk, she searches for clues in the snapshots she took of them and their parents on the first day.</p>
        <p>Turning to teaching was a bold move for Ms. Moffett, a sensitive and meticulous woman who has spent most of her adult life performing administrative tasks in orderly offices. She is used to a 9-to-5 schedule, a comfortable salary and a quiet, childless existence. More than a little perfectionist, she is used to fast and predictable results. So why take this frightening leap?</p>
        <p>''I was leading a pleasant life with very little risk,'' Ms. Moffett, a petite woman with curly brown hair, said last week. ''This school and these children, they may take everything I have. But there's a really deep well in me, and it's time to draw on it.''</p>
        <p>She said she agreed to let a reporter observe her during this uncomfortable first year because she believes so strongly in the importance of teaching, and in the potential of the teaching fellows program.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett was assigned to P.S. 92, a hulking brick building that takes up almost a block of Parkside Avenue in Flatbush, a working-class neighborhood increasingly populated by Caribbean immigrants. The state has been monitoring the school since 1989, long before Ms. Moffett's pupils were born, and has repeatedly threatened to close it. The school has been through five principals in five years. Although scores on city and state standardized reading tests rose sharply last year, nearly three-quarters of the students still read below grade level.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett, who has the enthusiasm of a baton twirler and the diligence of a research scholar, used to read these statistics in newspapers and discuss them with civic-minded friends. Now she is discovering what the numbers mean, up close and in painful detail.</p>
        <p>She is under tremendous pressure not only to start her young charges reading and writing, but also to prepare them for the tests that they will face in later grades -- tests that make or break schools like P.S. 92. Yet Ms. Moffett has barely begun learning how to teach. The teaching fellows program is paying her tuition for weekly graduate classes at the City University of New York, which will eventually lead to a master's degree in education. But most of her lessons will come on the job, at a school that cannot afford to allow many more mistakes.</p>
        <p>''I certainly hope that all my students will be reading by the end of first grade,'' she said two days before school started.</p>
        <p>But first, as experienced teachers warn repeatedly, Ms. Moffett's students need to learn the classroom rules. She recited them constantly during the first week of school, asking the children to chime in. In addition to working hard and being polite, they are expected to come to school by 8, to enter and leave the room quietly, to sit in their seats and listen carefully, and to raise their hands when they want to speak.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett promised her students a party at the end of the first week if they behaved nicely. Whenever the whole class followed a rule, she wrote another letter from the word ''party'' on the board.</p>
        <p>But on Day 4, plenty of rules were still being broken. Students lingered at the pencil sharpener and fooled around as Ms. Moffett took attendance. Some straggled in as late as 8:40. As Ms. Moffett, still smiling, went over the months of the year, Daysha, a restless, bright-eyed girl, raced to the front of the room and grabbed the chalk, ignoring Ms. Moffett's command to sit down.</p>
        <p>As the teacher dealt with the disruption, her aide, Ruth Baptiste, asked Larry, the sullen boy, what month came after May.</p>
        <p>''Do you want to guess?'' Ms. Baptiste asked.</p>
        <p>''No!'' Larry replied.</p>
        <p>''Why?'' the aide persisted as horns honked incessantly outside.</p>
        <p>''Because it's stupid,'' the boy grumbled, pounding his fist on his desk.</p>
        <p>To avoid overcrowding in the cafeteria, first graders at P.S. 92 go to lunch at 10:15. But on Day 4, Ms. Moffett held the girls back because they would not line up quietly. After three attempts, they still did not have it right. At 10:20, Daysha was scribbling on the board again. Ms. Moffett asked if she wanted to be the teacher instead of going to lunch, and Daysha screamed. Ms. Moffett tried another tactic: writing ''scream'' on the board. The girl started crawling around the floor.</p>
        <p>At 10:25, Brenda Robertson, an assistant principal, appeared in the doorway, raised her eyebrows at Ms. Moffett and silently led Daysha out.</p>
        <p>''I think you're finding out that I'm a strict teacher,'' Ms. Moffett said to the remaining students.</p>
        <p>Her smile was growing tight.</p>
        <p>When Donna Moffett graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in the Bronx in 1972, her yearbook predicted she would become a teacher. But family turmoil prompted her to drop out of Lehman College during her sophomore year and leave home. She moved to Boston, working as a secretary at Harvard, and then to Chicago, where she helped run a feminist bookstore and worked for a lawyer who had written domestic violence legislation for Illinois.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett did not return to New York until 1989. Still lacking a college degree, she joined Flemming, Zulack &amp; Williamson, a corporate law firm near Wall Street, where she was a legal secretary for a senior partner. She attended night classes at Baruch College, and in 1998 she received a bachelor's degree in literature.</p>
        <p>Although she liked her job, Ms. Moffett said, she increasingly felt as if she was not ''the kind of person I wanted to be, character-wise.'' Her literature classes made her think a lot about teaching, and last fall she took a graduate education course at Hunter College. When a friend told her about the teaching fellows program in July, she immediately sent for an application.</p>
        <p>''There just seemed so much about it that seemed custom-tailored for me and my circumstances,'' she said. ''I basically thought if I didn't make a move and make a sacrifice, then I would have to question my own authenticity.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett, who is so organized that she takes notes while being interviewed, did some homework before showing up for her August training. She learned everything she could about the city's low-performing schools, and the complex workings of the Board of Education. When a group of teaching fellows visited P.S. 92 to observe summer school, Ms. Moffett sized up the principal, Diana Rahmaan, as smart and inspiring and asked her for a job.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rahmaan arrived last year, just as P.S. 92 was running out of time to improve; state education officials will decide in November whether to close the school permanently in June. In the latest effort to turn around P.S. 92 and the 40 other schools in the so-called chancellor's district of failing schools, the city has required an extra 40 minutes of instruction a day, small class sizes and strict reading and mathematics curriculums.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rahmaan has also tried to make the school, built in 1905, look nicer. Last week new desks and chairs arrived, replacing furniture that had been there for decades. Ms. Moffett's classroom is brightly and copiously decorated with everything from cutout stars to Beatrix Potter posters.</p>
        <p>Still, it is a far cry from her well-appointed quarters at Flemming, Zulack, where she looked out on the Statue of Liberty. She has no computer and can make calls only from an overused pay phone outside the school auditorium. Instead of ordering her favorite brown rice with sauteed vegetables for lunch, she dashes out to the neighborhood's lone pizzeria or skips the meal altogether.</p>
        <p>Not that she could afford fancy lunches. She will earn just under $37,000 this year, compared with her previous salary of $60,000. That not only means fewer dinners out, shopping trips and Broadway plays, but in all likelihood exchanging her apartment in Chelsea for more modest quarters in Brooklyn. (''Do you know anything about the Ditmas area?'' she asked recently.)</p>
        <p>''I've been talking to my students about rewards and consequences, and the same is true for me,'' Ms. Moffett said after receiving her first paycheck last week: $686 after taxes for two weeks of work. ''One consequence for me is living with a lot less.''</p>
        <p>Her life is also changing in smaller ways. She always gets a seat on the subway, for example, because she is commuting deep into Brooklyn while most riders head the opposite way. She spends most of her waking hours in a neighborhood she never set foot in before. Her school shares a block with a Jehovah's Witnesses hall and low brick apartment buildings, some graffiti-stained. The surrounding streets brim with salons, bodegas and Caribbean restaurants. Kings County Hospital Center, a few blocks away, employs many neighborhood residents. But there are high rates of teenage pregnancy and H.I.V. infection, and many single-parent homes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett rises by 5 a.m. these days and often works on lesson plans past midnight. Instead of staying at work as late as she wants, she is kicked out of P.S. 92 by 5 p.m. for security reasons.</p>
        <p>And ever since school started, Ms. Moffett said, she has looked at the world with ''first-grade eyes,'' combing the landscape for things that would appeal to her students. She has decorated her classroom with some of her finds, including an animal cracker container shaped like a bear and a Winnie the Pooh photo album, and magnifying glasses and plastic insects for the science corner.</p>
        <p>The students especially love the ''library,'' a corner of the room where they sit on rubber place mats that Ms. Moffett brought in and listen to a story before lunch. On Day 4, it was ''Jamberry'' by Bruce Degen, about a bear in search of berries. Every last child was rapt as Ms. Moffett read lines like ''Berryband, merryband, jamming in berryland.'' As she read the last page, about the author's childhood memories of picking berries in the woods behind his home, the students grew silent, as if trying to imagine such a pastime in Flatbush.</p>
        <p>Afterward, as the other students swarmed the cookie jar, a quiet girl named Paula read the book to herself, pronouncing each word perfectly. Ms. Moffett has not yet determined how many others can read, but she clearly has a long way to go toward her goal of every student reading by June.</p>
        <p>''I wonder how a teacher, no matter how committed, strong, bright, creative, can do this alone,'' she said in a late-night phone conversation later that week. ''I feel as though I should not sleep.''</p>
        <p>Unlike many first-year teachers in New York City, Ms. Moffett and the other teaching fellows are not going it alone. She cannot stop praising the support she is receiving from colleagues, including a teacher with 15 years of experience who is Ms. Moffett's official mentor. Some co-workers invite her to observe their classes, while others share lesson plans and tips on discipline.</p>
        <p>She has found a confidant in James Raffel, a teaching fellow for social studies at P.S. 92. After school, the two huddle in Ms. Moffett's classroom to go over the day's events and buck each other up.</p>
        <p>By the second week of school, Ms. Moffett's techniques had evolved. She spoke more loudly and succinctly. When necessary she scowled. At lunch time, she did not insist on complete silence as the students lined up. Her strategy the previous week -- holding the students back when just one misbehaved -- was ''a big mistake,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''It's important to establish routines and reward good behavior,'' she said. ''But I'm not allowed to keep these children from their lunch. Everything here is on a schedule, and you have to abide by that.''</p>
        <p>At the urging of her supervisors, Ms. Moffett also scrapped her party plan. One week of good behavior did not merit such a celebration, they said, especially so early in the year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett is learning teaching techniques through trial and error, too. For the math lesson that day, she gave the children colored pieces of plastic and instructed them to determine which was longest. But they were so fascinated with the ''manipulatives,'' as the colored blocks are called, that they lost interest in the lesson.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we have to do math differently next time,'' she told them, thinking out loud. ''Maybe we have to do math without these wonderful manipulatives that everyone loves so much.'' Sure enough, an experienced teacher who observed the lesson said the manipulatives should go, at least until she had better control of the class.</p>
        <p>The story that morning was a touchy-feely number called ''A Rainbow of Friends,'' by P. K. Hallinan. The book is part of the school's strictly prescribed literacy curriculum.</p>
        <p>Most of Ms. Moffett's students moved enthusiastically from their desks to the reading corner, although Larry, still glum, dragged his heels. ''I hate this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry you hate it,'' Ms. Moffett replied calmly, ''but you still need to do it.''</p>
        <p>The class discussed unfamiliar words from the book. ''Repeat after me,'' Ms. Moffett said. ''Bonding means becoming good friends. Harmony means friendly agreement.''</p>
        <p>But the students seemed more interested in the drawings. They jumped up to point out a rainbow. Paula surreptitiously grabbed another book, about a dog in a bathtub, and started mouthing the words.</p>
        <p>At one point, Ms. Moffett chided a student for sucking her thumb. The others turned to stare, and many gleefully started imitating their classmate. With Ms. Baptiste's help, Ms. Moffett shushed them and continued reading. A line about how ''everyone can be given a share of our heart'' prompted Larry to cover his eyes and shake his head. ''Don't say that,'' he groaned, inexplicably upset by the story.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett paused to ask the students what their interests were.</p>
        <p>''Sleeping,'' Larry muttered. ''Sharing,'' Paula said. Daysha, irrepressible, leapt off her mat to hug the teacher. When Jaada, the thumb sucker, announced that she liked to eat mosquitoes, Ms. Moffett made a face and the whole class erupted in titters. Whether or not they knew the word, bonding was taking place.</p>
        <p>Ms. Moffett's First Year</p>
        <p>Faced with a serious shortage of teachers, New York City has been recruiting people from other careers and, after just a short ''boot camp,'' assigning them to some of the most troubled schools. This article is the first of a series that will follow one novice teacher.</p>
