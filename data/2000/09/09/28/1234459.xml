        <p>New Jersey has the highest rents in the nation for two-bedroom apartments this year, surpassing Hawaii, according to a private study based on figures from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
        <p>The study, released last week by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a nonprofit group based in Washington, found that the H.U.D. fair market rent for two bedrooms in New Jersey was $878. The fair market rent for an area is not an average market rent, but rather a figure below which 40 percent of market rents fall. Washington, D.C., was second, at $863, followed by Hawaii ($859), Massachusetts ($854), New York ($834) and Connecticut ($815).</p>

        <p>New York and Vermont are tied as the least affordable places to live, the survey found. In both states, 48 percent of families have to spend more than 30 percent of their income on rent. New Jersey was among the 15 least affordable places, tied with six other states at 44 percent, while Connecticut was among the 19 least affordable, at 42 percent.</p>
