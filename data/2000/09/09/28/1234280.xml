        <p>Master's Touch  The German Expressionist Franz Marc (1880-1916) and his paintings of horses will be the focus of a show that opens tomorrow for a run through March 18 at Harvard's Busch-Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, Mass. The exhibition, ''Franz Marc: Horses,'' is billed as the first exclusive presentation of Marc's work in the United States in more than 20 years. The show, built around ''The Red Horses,'' explores the spiritual intensity of color in the artist's interpretation of the natural world. From Dec. 23 to March 18, the museum will present ''The Blue Rider Artists,'' a complementary exhibition devoted to that influential group.</p>
        <p>Song and Dance  Patter songs, an examination of dance rhythms and evocations of human trials like aging and lost love as well as audience requests will be part of the fun when ''Glorious G&amp;S!'' ushers in the 2000-2001 season, the 27th, of the New York Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Players. The time is 3 p.m. The day is Sunday. The place is Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street. The program will focus on the less frequently performed Gilbert &amp; Sullivan scores.</p>

        <p>Song and Dance  Patter songs, an examination of dance rhythms and evocations of human trials like aging and lost love as well as audience requests will be part of the fun when ''Glorious G&amp;S!'' ushers in the 2000-2001 season, the 27th, of the New York Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Players. The time is 3 p.m. The day is Sunday. The place is Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street. The program will focus on the less frequently performed Gilbert &amp; Sullivan scores.</p>
        <p>World Fusion  With a performance by Ragamala Music and Dance fusing classic East Indian music, poetry and dance with Western influences, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark will open its fourth World Festival at its Victoria Theater at 2 p.m. on Sunday. Extending into May, this season's festival will feature 19 events. Five events focused on the dance and culture of Taiwan will be presented under the title ''Festival of the Moon.''</p>
        <p>A Different Look  Is there a truth beyond accepted reality? Influenced by Freudian theories of free association, dreams and the subconscious, the Surrealist movement undertook this search. Beginning tomorrow, this revolt against convention, which reached its height in the 1920's and 30's, will be explored at the Nassau County Museum of Art in Roslyn Heights in an exhibition that assembles 95 works by artists like Dali, Ernst, Magritte, Picasso, Jean Arp, Man Ray, de Chirico and Miro. Continuing through Jan. 14, ''Surrealism,'' based on loans from private collections, includes among its oils, sculptures, works on paper and other objects much art rarely seen by the public.</p>
