        <p>Yasir Arafat traveled 19 miles off the Gaza coast today to light the first flare stack over a major offshore deposit of natural gas, proclaiming it ''a gift from our God to our people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat, celebrating the multibillion-dollar discovery of what industry officials confirmed is a major gas deposit, said it would provide ''a strong foundation for a Palestinian state.''</p>
        <p>''This is a gift from our God to our people, to our children, to our women, to our people inside and outside, to our refugees and those who are living here on our land,'' the Palestinian leader declared. The deposit is considered more than enough gas to meet Palestinian needs for a decade.</p>
        <p>He gave a signal to the foreign crew to light the flare atop the floating platform, and gas from the test well burned overhead. Reciting a passage from the Koran, he echoed a divine promise that the ''weak and dispossessed of today'' will become the ''leaders and heirs'' of the future.</p>
        <p>The BG Group of London, which won a concession in November from Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority to drill in the 2,000-foot-deep waters off the Gaza Strip, said today that this first Gaza test well was flowing at a strong 37 million cubic feet a day, more than in any of eight recent offshore gas strikes in nearby Israeli territorial waters.</p>
        <p>''We have made an extremely good discovery,'' Timothy Forbes, who runs BG operations in North Africa and the Middle East, told reporters in Gaza.</p>
        <p>The Israeli government, despite criticism from rightist opposition leaders, has tacitly permitted the exploration effort, renouncing any sovereignty over the Mediterranean waters directly off the Gaza Strip. One Israeli gas-exploration consortium, contending that the Palestinian Authority lacks the legal status to grant energy exploration permits, has sued in Israeli courts to block the Gaza drilling.</p>
        <p>Executives said BG could not confirm reserve figures until it had further analysis of the drilling information next month. Yet even by conservative estimates, they said, the mile-deep deposit known as Gaza Marine 1 should more than satisfy projected Palestinian electric power needs for 10 to 20 years, with enough left over for possible sale to Israeli or other foreign customers.</p>
        <p>''That is one of the key messages here today,'' said Hugh Miller, who manages the Palestinian and Israeli concessions of BG. ''There will be gas available for export. And from my conversations with Palestinian officials, including President Arafat, it is clear that they have no interest in just sitting on a gas surplus.''</p>
        <p>At current prices, the value of the strike was estimated $2 billion to $6 billion, depending on pressure, quantity and other variables. It could take two to three years and $250 million to build the pipelines and other installations needed to deliver the gas onshore, Palestinian officials said today.</p>
        <p>A domestic Palestinian gas supply could eventually eliminate spending on electricity and household fuels that are now imported from Israel, and exports would provide a needed source of dollars. The gas industry ''will prove to be one of the main economic cornerstones for a future independent state of Palestine,'' predicted Said Khoury, president of the Consolidated Contractors Company of Athens, the minority partner in the project.</p>
        <p>The BG Group plans to drill at least one more test well off Gaza while continuing explorations in adjacent concessions in Israeli waters.</p>
