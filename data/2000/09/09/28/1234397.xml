        <p>The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide by Saturday whether it will approve the abortion pill, known as mifepristone or RU-486, for sale in the United States. It would be the first alternative to surgical abortion approved here.</p>
        <p>The drug allows women to terminate pregnancy within seven weeks of their last menstrual period. It has been sold in Europe and elsewhere in the world for more than a decade, and an F.D.A. advisory committee has recommended approving the drug for this country. The agency usually accepts such recommendations.</p>
        <p>But it has been stalled by abortion politics in the United States.</p>
        <p>Opponents of legal abortion have urged that the drug not be sold in the United States. They say it is more dangerous than surgical abortions, causing severe bleeding in about 2 percent of women and incomplete abortions in about 5 percent to 8 percent, requiring that the women have surgical abortions to complete the procedure.</p>
        <p>Abortion rights groups have urged that the drug be approved, saying it would change the abortion landscape by making the procedure a private matter between a woman and her doctor.</p>
        <p>The drug's maker, the Roussel Ucalf unit of Hoechst A.G., declined to seek marketing approval for it in the United States, saying it feared protests from opponents of abortion rights. In 1994, the company gave the drug's patent to a nonprofit group, the Population Council, which set out to get market approval.</p>
        <p>An F.D.A. advisory committee recommended four years ago that the drug be approved and the agency, under its former commissioner, Dr. David A. Kessler, wrote to the Population Council saying the drug could be approved if certain conditions were met. But the council has had difficulty finding a company to make the drug and one to market it.</p>
        <p>Then six months ago, the Danco Laboratories, a company that was formed to market the drug for the Population Council, submitted its application to the F.D.A. for approval. The agency nearly always responds to such applications within six months, a deadline that falls in this case on Saturday.</p>
