        <p>The Yankees whipped the Red Sox in three games at Fenway Park earlier this month, and it appeared that Manager Joe Torre would be able to use the last two weeks of the regular season to preen and tweak and prepare for the postseason.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees have dropped 11 of their last 14 games, and even after they finish the job of clinching the American League East, Torre intends to push his team through the last days of the regular season, in an effort to gain home-field advantage for at least the first round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''We're full bore right now until we know where we're going to be,'' Torre said. ''We have five or six games left, and we need to win.''</p>
        <p>That means no extra rest for Paul O'Neill, who sometimes runs as if he is tied to a fence post, because of a hip pointer. That means Torre will not have as much leeway to audition bullpen candidates like David Cone and Randy Choate. That means Torre will not have as much opportunity to regulate the workload of his three primary relievers, Mariano Rivera, Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have a record of 87-70 after last night's 11-1 loss to the Devil Rays. The Oakland Athletics (88-69), who won earlier today against the Angels, are a game ahead of the Yankees. And the Seattle Mariners, who played at home later tonight, had an identical record as the A's before their game against the Rangers. If the Mariners win the A.L. West and post a better record than the Yankees and if Oakland is the wild-card team, the Yankees will open the playoffs in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Torre said earlier this month that he was not concerned about having the league's best record, but over the last couple of days, he has stressed the idea that he wants the Yankees to open the playoffs at home.</p>
        <p>Torre could make an exception in his handling of Orlando Hernandez, who is scheduled to start Sunday, on the last day of the regular season. Hernandez figures to be the No. 3 starter in the playoffs and would pitch Oct. 4; if that is the case, Hernandez could start Saturday and pitch just a few innings before being relieved.</p>
        <p>Roger Clemens, bruised on his right thigh by a hard grounder in his last start, will make his next scheduled start here Thursday, after reporting that his contusion feels better. Clemens is in line to pitch the first game of the playoffs next Tuesday, and will most likely be followed by Andy Pettitte, Hernandez and Denny Neagle.</p>
        <p>Discrepancy in Negotiations</p>
        <p>When the agent for the left-hander Denny Neagle met with Yankee officials, he asked for an extension of $10 million or more a year over four to five years, a person familiar with the talks said.</p>
        <p>In the first weeks after the Yankees traded for Neagle, the left-hander said he was looking for a contract similar to that signed by Minnesota's Brad Radke, who negotiated a four-year, $36 million deal, or $9 million a year. When asked about the discrepancy between his own statements in July and the asking price his agent aimed at the Yankees, Neagle said that he was not specifically aware of the contents of the talks, and that he was sure that this was just part of the negotiations.</p>
        <p>Neagle's performance in the coming playoffs could have a significant impact on a new deal. The Yankees already have three starting pitchers under contract for next year: Roger Clemens, who will be paid $30.9 million over the next two years; Orlando Hernandez, who will be in the last year of a four-year, $6.6 million contract; and Andy Pettitte, who signed a three-year, $25 million deal before this season.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre Is Improving</p>
        <p>Some of his friends with the Yankees say that Mel Stottlemyre, the pitching coach who is being treated for bone marrow cancer, was able to walk around the halls adjacent to his hospital room at Sloan-Kettering for the first time in two weeks. ''He's doing much better,'' Manager Joe Torre said, ''which is anticipated.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Stottlemyre went through a stem-cell transplant.</p>
        <p>Kudos for Lasorda</p>
        <p>Tommy Lasorda, the longtime manager of the Dodgers, led the United States Olympic team to a gold medal, parading around the field after the Americans defeated Cuba in the championship game.</p>
        <p>''Congratulations, Tommy Lasorda,'' Torre said. ''I think it's great, because I know he loves that.''</p>
