        <p>THE SENATE --</p>
        <p>A CHALLENGE MADE AND DISMISSED -- Just as in New York, Washington State's candidates for the United States Senate have gotten into a spat over the use of so-called soft money by outside groups in their campaigns.  The Democratic aspirant, former Representative Maria Cantwell, wants all independent groups that have been advertising on her behalf, as well as the Democratic Party, to cease doing so. She also wants the Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton, to issue such a pledge himself. ''I would rather lose without the benefit of soft money than win with it,'' Ms. Cantwell said on Tuesday.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE --</p>
        <p>A CHALLENGE MADE AND DISMISSED -- Just as in New York, Washington State's candidates for the United States Senate have gotten into a spat over the use of so-called soft money by outside groups in their campaigns.  The Democratic aspirant, former Representative Maria Cantwell, wants all independent groups that have been advertising on her behalf, as well as the Democratic Party, to cease doing so. She also wants the Republican incumbent, Slade Gorton, to issue such a pledge himself. ''I would rather lose without the benefit of soft money than win with it,'' Ms. Cantwell said on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gorton said the vow amounted to a ''phony pledge'' because the great majority of the campaign spending by Ms. Cantwell, who made a fortune estimated at $40 million as an Internet executive, has come from her own bank account. Mr. Gorton challenged her to to agree that at least 70 percent of her campaign money would henceforth come from individual contributors. Ms. Cantwell countered: ''Unlike Senator Gorton, I have only one special interest -- the interest of the voters.''</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GENTLE RIBBING BY GORE -- Like many politicians, Vice President Al Gore has a long memory. On a trip to Iowa yesterday, it stretched back to last winter when Mr. Gore was campaigning against former Senator Bill Bradley. Iowa's Democratic governor, Tom Vilsack, remained studiously neutral, while his wife, Christie, enthusiastically backed Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>During a speech at a community center in Altoona yesterday, Mr. Gore acknowledged the presence of Mr. Vilsack, who now travels regularly with the vice president on his visits to the state.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to seeing Christie a little bit later,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Now, I'm glad to see you, Governor. But I've never let him forget that Christie had just a little bit better political judgment.''</p>
        <p>During Mr. Gore's discussion on Medicare, 79-year-old Winifred Skinner, a retiree from Des Moines, rose to tell Mr. Gore that she collects aluminum cans several hours a day because her Social Security and pension benefits will not pay for both her living expenses and her prescription costs of $230 a month. ''How much do you earn a week?'' Mr. Gore asked. ''You're not going to tell the government, are you?'' Ms. Skinner answered, sending both Mr. Gore and the audience into convulsions of laughter.</p>

        <p>THE FUND-RAISING</p>
        <p>BIG MONEY NIGHT -- With Election Day now less than six weeks off, fund-raising is more frenetic than ever. Just last night, Vice President Al Gore raised more than $3.5 million for the Democratic National Committee, bringing his total take for the party in the last 16 days to nearly $25 million and his total take since January to more than $65 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore attended two events, starting with a reception at a downtown Washington hotel for the Women's Leadership Forum. More than 800 people, paying $125 each, contributed about $500,000. He then took his motorcade to a dinner at the Washington home of Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat, where about 300 people, paying a minimum of $5,000 each, contributed more than $3 million.</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG  Al Gore continued his swing through the Midwest, talking health care in Iowa and questioning George W. Bush's commitment to improving the system. Mr. Bush, meanwhile, continued to work the West Coast, talking education in Los Angeles and questioning Mr. Gore's commitment to improvement. At the end of the day, both headed for home, Mr. Bush back to Austin and Mr. Gore back to Washington.</p>
        <p>The stats:</p>
        <p>Length of the Official Day: Gore, 14 hours; Bush, 12 1/2 hours  States Visited: Gore, 2; Bush, 2  Towns and Cities Visited: Gore, 3; Bush, 2  Events: Gore, 3; Bush, 4  Press Conferences/Interviews: Gore, 13; Bush, 6  Debate preparation: Gore, 0 hours; Bush, 2 1/2 hours  Diners Visited/Unscheduled Drop-bys: Gore, 0; Bush, 0  Main message: Gore, strengthening Medicare; Bush, strengthening schools.</p>
