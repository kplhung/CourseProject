        <p>In the crumbling streets of a faded Belgrade, tired and worn from 10 years of international sanctions and isolation, most people have simply had enough of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>But they know he is not going to go quietly after his apparent defeat in the presidential election on Sunday. And they are nervous about a police crackdown.</p>
        <p>''This is Serbia, so why should anything be easy?'' said Sasa, drinking an espresso at the Ipanema cafe. ''Everything is clear. It's not finished, but it's clear.''</p>
        <p>Gojko Komazec, a waiter, said few believe the preliminary vote totals that the state television suddenly announced Tuesday night, showing Mr. Milosevic trailing his main challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, but denying Mr. Kostunica an outright victory in the first round.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica immediately accused the government of vote fraud, challenged the Federal Election Commission to verify its results, and said he would not take part in a second round on Oct. 8.</p>
        <p>Is Mr. Milosevic finished? ''I hope so,'' Mr. Komazec said. ''This is the first time I can remember that I'm not worried about our future. But I am very worried about the next few days,'' when the opposition, which says Mr. Kostunica has won outright, holds rallies to support him.</p>
        <p>On the streets, people were snapping up independent daily newspapers like Blic, Danas and Glas Javnosti to get the news, and there were angry conversations about Mr. Milosevic's effort to buy time and hang on to power.</p>
        <p>While many of the buildings in Belgrade damaged last year by NATO airstrikes have been repaired, including the Foreign Ministry and the Serbian Parliament, other buildings, like the headquarters of the Yugoslav Army and the Serbian and federal Interior Ministry buildings, are untouched, blasted and sooty.</p>
        <p>Even the Brankov Bridge over the Sava River to New Belgrade is only half painted, with one set of guardrails an already fading blue, while the other side was never repainted at all. But the markets are full of fruits and vegetables, even if there is grumbling over the prices, with cucumbers costing about 50 cents a pound and apples at 45 cents a pound in a country where the average wage is now about $40 a month.</p>
        <p>''It would be better for all of us if he just goes, and takes his family, too,'' said Pero Drvenica, pushing his 3-year-old daughter, Milica, through the Kalenic market, full of bright red peppers and orange squashes. ''He's finished, and he has to know it. It's obvious he lost and he's in a panic, and nobody believes this children's story of a second round.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Drvenica said he would go to any rally the opposition called, and bring Milica, too. ''It's her future,'' he said. ''This guy, if he's clever, could finish this very easily and just accept the vote of the people. In a second round he'll be humiliated even more.''</p>
        <p>Darko, who insisted that his last name not be used, said pressure had been put on him at work to sign a petition for Mr. Milosevic's candidacy. In the end, he said, he signed twice, for different bosses. He voted for Mr. Kostunica anyway, in part because of his anti-Communism.</p>
        <p>''Milosevic has got to go,'' Darko said. ''I'm so happy, but mostly for my father,'' whose property was confiscated after World War II by the victorious Communists. He said he had persuaded his sister, a Milosevic supporter, to vote for Mr. Kostunica as well. ''I told her, 'Don't vote for yourself. Vote for your kids.' ''</p>
        <p>Dragana Kreca, 31, who works as a waitress, complained that jobs in state companies were mostly reserved for members of the ruling parties of Mr. Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic.</p>
        <p>''Milosevic is over,'' Ms. Kreca said. ''Maybe not today, but sometime soon. Serbia voted for Kostunica and a different future -- it's enough of this life of cattle.''</p>
        <p>Miroslav Curcic, 48, was selling huge sacks of peppers and cucumbers from his truck. ''I don't know how Milosevic will give up technically and how he'll accept his loss, but he's gone,'' Mr. Curcic said.</p>
        <p>''America punished all of us because of this guy, who was your ally at one moment, and you didn't do much to help us get rid of him,'' he said. ''Now he can go to China or India -- it doesn't matter -- but he has to go.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Curcic, Mr. Milosevic's campaign was offensive. ''These are stupidities they sell to old people,'' he said. ''We all know our kids aren't terrorists, and it's crazy to call anyone who thinks different an enemy of the state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kostunica, by contrast, said Nenad Piljak, is ''a normal man.'' Mr. Piljak sells fruit in the morning and studies to be a physiotherapist in the afternoon, and he likes Mr. Kostunica's defense of Serbian interests.</p>
        <p>''I believe it is an honest and fair patriotism that he represents,'' Mr. Piljak said. ''I think it's fine that he has this distance from America. Serbia belongs in Europe. The Americans bombed this country and committed a big crime.''</p>
        <p>Didn't European countries in NATO bomb too? ''Yes, they participated,'' he said. ''But everyone knows who the big boss is.''</p>
        <p>The Serbs committed crimes in Kosovo, Mr. Piljak said, especially with the expulsion of so many Albanians. ''But Serbia was also defending what belongs to her,'' he said. Mr. Kostunica strikes the right balance, Mr. Piljak said, while he found the Milosevic campaign off-putting.</p>
        <p>''The biggest crime is to divide your own people into patriots and traitors because of their political beliefs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>These elections ''are the beginning of the end of Milosevic,'' Mr. Piljak said. ''He needs to lose the Serbian elections before he finally goes.''</p>
        <p>As for himself, Mr. Piljak has no plans to study this week. ''I'm going to go to the rallies and greet my new president,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Slobodan Brankovic, a civil engineer, will go too. But he is anxious. ''I hope Milosevic is finished, but I'm not sure,'' he said. ''He still has the police and the army. I'm too old -- I'm 51 -- and I'm a little bit afraid of what will happen, but really I'm afraid for my kids.''</p>
        <p>Predrag Stankovic, 32, says that he voted for the first time in 10 years, and that he thinks Mr. Kostunica is right to reject a second round.</p>
        <p>''In the evening I'll come out with my brother and my friends to the rallies, and if we have to fight, we'll fight,'' he said. ''But I don't think the police and army will fight with us. I really do expect them to accept the will of the people.''</p>
