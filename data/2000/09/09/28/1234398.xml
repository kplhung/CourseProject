        <p>If a bill allowing imports of low-priced prescription drugs becomes law, drug companies will be able to use many tactics to protect their profits, Wall Street analysts said yesterday, and keep the amount of reimported drugs to a minimum.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups gave the plan to reimport prescription medicines from countries like Canada or Mexico a tepid thumbs up yesterday, saying they would continue to push elected officials to do more to rein in drug prices. Drug purchases are now the leading cause of the nation's rising health care costs.</p>
        <p>''We are not jumping for joy,'' said Judy Waxman, deputy executive director of Families USA, a nonprofit group in Washington that focuses on making health care more affordable. ''It could possibly help some people. But we don't know how it will play out.''</p>
        <p>The pharmaceutical industry makes most of its profit in the United States, the only major country where the government has not enacted controls on drug prices. The drug reimportation bill now pending in Congress is meant to chip away at those profits. But analysts said yesterday that they could not yet predict just how the industry could be affected.</p>
        <p>Neil B. Sweig, an analyst at Ryan Beck &amp; Company, said that prices of some drugs could decline as much as 30 percent to 40 percent -- which is estimated to be the average difference between prices in the United States and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But other analysts said they expected the companies to be able to minimize the sale of reimported drugs by keeping tight controls on the quantities of drugs shipped to lower-priced countries or by sharpening the differences between foreign-sold and American-sold pills. For example, said Richard T. Evans, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, the companies could make the pills sold in foreign countries different sizes, shapes and colors from the drugs sold here, which would keep them from being reimported here.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, House Republican leaders announced that they would approve the Senate-passed version of a drug reimportation bill, which is also favored by President Clinton. The move by Republicans makes passage of the bill into law almost certain.</p>
        <p>The bill would allow pharmacies and wholesale distributors to buy prescription drugs abroad, reimport them and then sell them to consumers at a lower cost. The measure is not expected to have an impact for two years because the Food and Drug Administration will need to write regulations to govern the imports.</p>
        <p>The bill is aimed at helping people who take drugs like Prilosec, a popular heartburn drug sold by AstraZeneca. According to an analysis by the National Council of Senior Citizens, the United States retail cost of a monthly supply of Prilosec is $105.50. The same number of Prilosec pills sells for $53.51 in Canada and $29.46 in Mexico.</p>
        <p>A monthly supply of another drug, Fosamax, a medication for osteoporosis that is made by the Merck &amp; Company, sells for $169.73 in the United States, according to the council's analysis. That compares with a price of $45.01 in Canada and $51.33 in Mexico.</p>
        <p>Closing that price gap by even a fraction would hurt the profits of drug companies because of their dependence on sales in the United States, which is the largest and fastest-growing market for drugs.</p>
        <p>The idea of reimporting drugs into the United States is similar to a process now allowed in Europe. Companies known as parallel importers have been able to make a business of shipping products from southern European countries such as Spain and Greece, where drug prices are low, to northern countries like Britain and Germany, where prices are higher.</p>
        <p>But despite the opportunities, parallel importing accounts for less than 5 percent of European drug revenue, said Jeffrey Chaffkin, an analyst at PaineWebber, in a recent report. The drug companies have been able to minimize the impact, Mr. Chaffkin said, by tightly controlling the quantities of drugs they ship to lower-priced countries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans of Bernstein said that the companies could also make slight changes to their factories that make drugs for other countries so that they no longer meet the requirements of the F.D.A. and could not be reimported. Mr. Evans said that could be as easy as switching a single step in the manufacturing process, such as the pressing of the drugs into pills, to a plant that did not choose to seek F.D.A. approval.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sweig at Ryan, Beck said that he did not believe that the companies would be so successful at minimizing the impact. He said that he expected prices to first drop for popular oral drugs that are used for chronic problems like high cholesterol, arthritis or heart disease. Later, Mr. Sweig said, the prices of injectable drugs used by hospitals should come down.</p>
