        <p>Koch Digs Deep For His Candidates</p>
        <p>EDWARD I. KOCH, the former mayor, says that people who describe him as a tightwad are, pardon the expression, right on the money. But he said yesterday that he had been busy writing checks: $1,000 to HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON for her United States Senate campaign and $1,000 to the campaign of VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE and SENATOR JOSEPH I.

        <p>Koch Digs Deep For His Candidates</p>
        <p>EDWARD I. KOCH, the former mayor, says that people who describe him as a tightwad are, pardon the expression, right on the money. But he said yesterday that he had been busy writing checks: $1,000 to HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON for her United States Senate campaign and $1,000 to the campaign of VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE and SENATOR JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN.</p>
        <p>''I've spent more money this year supporting candidates than I have in any year I can recall,'' he said, ''other than when I supported myself.''</p>
        <p>So what made a man whose mantra used to be ''I give time'' give money?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, he said, ''placed herself in a position where he has $10 million and she has $7 million, and that's not fair.'' The ''he'' to whom Mr. Koch referred was her opponent, REPRESENTATIVE RICK A. LAZIO.</p>
        <p>As for why he decided to send money to the Gore-Lieberman campaign, he said: ''On the issues, the Democrats are going to cream the Republicans, and I believe there will be an across-the-board victory, both houses, Gore, Lieberman and Hillary. But it can't come true unless they get their message out. I don't want Gore to have to go to any more Buddhist temples to raise money. I want him to spend mine.''</p>
        <p>TV Landmarks And Their Fans</p>
        <p>There is some history here somewhere. It seems to be institutional history (the institution is the Landmarks Conservancy, a private, nonprofit group), or personal history (something about the conservancy's president, a party and some spilled wine).</p>
        <p>JERRY ORBACH and SAM WATERSTON, two of the stars of the long-running New York police drama ''Law and Order,'' are among those who have been named living landmarks by the conservancy, which came up with the idea of designating well-known people as living landmarks as a fund-raising gimmick several years ago.</p>
        <p>Why them?</p>
        <p>''We have a phenomenal number of 'Law and Order' groupies on the board and staff of the conservancy,'' said Peg Breen, president of the conservancy.</p>
        <p>This is where the institutional history comes in. A writer from the show called the conservancy for advice on the scene he was working on. ''Sure enough, when the episode comes on and that black thing comes up and you see what office they're going to, it said, 'Office of the Landmarks Conservancy,' '' Ms. Breen recalled. But there was a but: ''Our office looks nowhere as nice as the one they gave us on television.''</p>
        <p>Then there was Ms. Breen's encounter with Mr. Orbach at a recent party.</p>
        <p>''I was too shy to go up to him by myself,'' she said. ''I grabbed a friend and said, 'Come help me talk to Jerry Orbach.' We're standing there babbling about how wonderful he is and we were once on his show. Somebody hit my friend from behind and his glass of wine went all over Jerry's shirt, suit jacket, tie. I wanted to just die.''</p>
        <p>It was white wine, by the way.</p>
        <p>This year's other living landmarks are the mezzo-soprano BETTY ALLEN; LOUIS S. AUCHINCLOSS, novelist and biographer of Woodrow Wilson; PAUL BINDER and MICHAEL CHRISTIANSEN, the founders of the Big Apple Circus; JOSEPH CULLMAN III, a philanthropist; and ARIE L. KOPELMAN, the president of of Chanel, who Ms. Breen said was hesitant at first about being a living landmark. ''The deciding factor was his wife and daughter are 'Law and Order' fans,'' Ms. Breen said. ''He said he had to do this so they could meet them.''</p>
        <p>A Barrymore Plea</p>
        <p>JAID BARRYMORE, the mother of the actress DREW BARRYMORE, pleaded guilty to a weapons possession charge yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barrymore, 54, was arrested in May while putting up posters for a rock band in SoHo. The Police Department said at the time that the officers from the department's Graffiti Unit who took her into custody found a .357 Magnum revolver, loaded with two bullets, in her purse. She could have received up to seven years in prison, but JUSTICE JAMES YATES sentenced her to 10 days of community service.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office said that PAUL CHARNIN, who was arrested with Ms. Barrymore about 2 a.m. on Broadway near Houston Street, pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in May and was sentenced to a day of community service.</p>
