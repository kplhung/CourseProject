        <p>As pre-eminent as it is in the world of country music, Nashville has barely registered on the radar of classical music listeners. But since 1983 Kenneth Schermerhorn has been building the Nashville Symphony into a solid, disciplined ensemble, and when the orchestra made its Carnegie Hall debut on Monday evening it gave a performance that was mostly a knockout. And now that it has undertaken an ambitious American music series for Naxos, it is likely to have a higher profile.</p>
        <p>That Nashville should have a fine orchestra stands to reason. Like New York and Los Angeles, it is a hub of the recording industry, which means that studio jobs are plentiful for highly trained musicians. The orchestra on the Carnegie stage on Monday looked youthful and fresh, and played with the energy of an ensemble that was out to impress.</p>

        <p>As pre-eminent as it is in the world of country music, Nashville has barely registered on the radar of classical music listeners. But since 1983 Kenneth Schermerhorn has been building the Nashville Symphony into a solid, disciplined ensemble, and when the orchestra made its Carnegie Hall debut on Monday evening it gave a performance that was mostly a knockout. And now that it has undertaken an ambitious American music series for Naxos, it is likely to have a higher profile.</p>
        <p>That Nashville should have a fine orchestra stands to reason. Like New York and Los Angeles, it is a hub of the recording industry, which means that studio jobs are plentiful for highly trained musicians. The orchestra on the Carnegie stage on Monday looked youthful and fresh, and played with the energy of an ensemble that was out to impress.</p>
        <p>In that spirit, Mr. Schermerhorn brought an ambitious program. With Beethoven's ''Creatures of Prometheus'' Overture as a curtain raiser, the orchestra played the new, scholarly edition of the Ives Second Symphony before the intermission. A recent Double Violin Concerto by Mark O'Connor (played by Mr. O'Connor and Nadia Salerno-Sonnenberg) opened the second half, and a suite from Strauss's ''Rosenkavalier'' closed the formal part of the concert.</p>
        <p>The orchestra wasted no time establishing its bona fides. It played the opening of the Beethoven with a commanding solidity that resonated through the hall. There was much to admire in the warmth and suppleness of its string playing; qualities were probed more fully in the Ives, as were the considerable virtues of the orchestra's wind and brass choirs. It played the Ives, in fact, like the grand Romantic symphony it actually is, Ives's image as a revolutionary notwithstanding. In the first movement, particularly, there were stretches that could almost have been Vaughan Williams.</p>
        <p>That said, when Ivesian parody did emerge, in the finale, Mr. Schermerhorn and his players ran with it, but without overstating it. Interesting, too, were some of the apparent differences between the standard edition and the revised edition. Particularly striking were the shift from tutti to solo strings at the end of the first movement, and tempo alterations throughout the work.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Connor's program note about his Double Violin Concerto promised a blues- and jazz-inspired work rather than the folksy score that one might expect of him, but it was a while before folk fiddling gave way to anything even glancingly jazzy. A 30-minute work in three movements, it was pleasant enough, and a crowd-pleaser. It touched on blues figures in its middle movement and big band jazz in its finale. The brass excelled here; the strings were oddly diffuse.</p>
        <p>Mostly, though, the focus was on the extended cadenzas, in which Mr. O'Connor and Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg gamely traded virtuosic lines. The format was that of a jam session in which soloists seek to outdo each other. Exactly what that means when both soloists' lines are tightly scripted is difficult to say: this was more of a staged fistfight than a true barroom brawl.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schermerhorn closed with a sweepingly Romantic account of the Strauss suite, in which the strings were again at the plush best. This is an orchestra that isn't afraid of the exposed textures of a slow movement. And as Mr. Schermerhorn showed in the speedy account of Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide'' Overture that he offered as an encore, the players are not afraid of velocity either.</p>
