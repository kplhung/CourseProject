        <p>MANHATTAN: SCOOTER SAFETY PROPOSAL  A City Council bill introduced yesterday would require all children under 14 to wear helmets while using scooters in New York City. The bill was drafted in response to the recent death of a 6-year-old New Jersey boy struck by a car while using a scooter. (Proposals have been made in New Jersey for a similar law.) Violators would pay a $50 fine. The bill would also require the distribution of pamphlets on scooter safety.</p>

        <p>COMMACK: STATE TO BE SUED IN KILLINGS  The family of a victim of Michael J. Swango, left, the former doctor who pleaded guilty to killing three Long Island men while at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northport, has taken the first step toward suing New York State. This month, Mr. Swango said he killed Thomas Sammarco, 73; George Siano, 60; and Aldo Serini, 62, while a resident at the medical center. Mr. Siano's family filed a notice of claim against New York, and the families of the other victims said they intended to join the suit. All three families plan to sue Ohio as well, for what they charge was a lax investigation of Mr. Swango when he was under suspicion of killing two patients in 1984 as an intern at Ohio State University Hospital.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: McCALL BACKS DEBT PLAN  State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said yesterday that he had decided to ask voters to support a $3.8 billion transportation borrowing act, which will be the largest sale of state bonds in American history if it is approved in November. Mr. McCall, a critic of the state's reliance on borrowing, said the projects the bond act would help finance, including engineering work for the Second Avenue subway line, were needed to ensure that New York remained ''economically competitive.'' But he said he was less than enthusiastic because New York was continuing to borrow ''with no concern for our mounting debt load.''</p>

        <p>THE BRONX: WOMAN ATTACKED  A 24-year-old woman was raped at gunpoint yesterday morning in Bronx Park, near the New York Botanical Garden, by a man who was later arrested, the police said. The woman was in the sliver of park that lies east of the Bronx River Parkway at 9:30 a.m. when the man, Miguel Camacho, 24, attacked her, the authorities said. Mr. Camacho, of Morris Avenue in the Bronx, was arrested last night after a daylong search. He was charged with rape and weapons possession, said Detective John Giammarino, a police spokesman.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: GARAGE LACKED BARRIERS  There were no protective concrete wheel blocks at the Virginia Beach, Va., parking deck where four New York nurses were killed when their car crashed through a rooftop cinderblock wall and fell 41 feet. The Sandcastle Resort Motel garage was built in 1985, and officials were investigating whether codes that applied to the building required wheel guards.</p>

        <p>FARMINGVILLE: 64 CHARGED WITH LEWDNESS  The Suffolk County police said yesterday that they had arrested 64 men over three weeks and charged them with public lewdness. Most of the men had been engaging in sexual activities at the Vietnam Memorial here. Several veterans and other visitors to the park, on County Road 83, complained to the police, who conducted an undercover operation from Sept. 2 to 22. Those arrested included a New York City schoolteacher and an assistant football coach at Bellport High School, the police said.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: CONEY ISLAND GANG ARRESTS  The authorities announced yesterday that 14 members of a Coney Island street gang had been arrested on charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, assault, robbery and drug dealing in and around the Marlboro Houses, a public housing project in southern Brooklyn. Known as ''the Cream Team,'' the gang name is an acronym for Cash Rules Everything Around Me. Prosecutors said the gang was particularly violent, typically beating their victims, robbing them and stripping them of their clothes.</p>

        <p>PARSIPPANY: FEDERAL CUTOFF THREATENED  The federal government has threatened to cut off funds to New Jersey for the operation of Greystone Psychiatric Hospital by Oct. 12 because of what the government calls inadequate staffing. The funds, which are reimbursements to the state for the treatment of Medicare and Medicaid patients and the uninsured, totaled $42 million last year, or much of the hospital's $50 million budget. The State Department of Human Services, which runs Greystone, said it had hired 99 new nurses, technicians and other staff members, and had moved 43 of Greystone's 615 patients.</p>

        <p>WYCKOFF: MORE JAIL IN INFANT'S DEATH  Brian C. Peterson, who served 18 months of a two-year prison sentence after he and his girlfriend pleaded guilty to negligent manslaughter in the death of their newborn son in 1996 in Delaware, may be sent back to jail after being arrested Tuesday night at Shea Stadium. As he and a friend, Raymond Maniaci, watched a Mets game, according to the police, Mr. Maniaci tossed a partly filled bottle at John Rocker, the outspoken relief pitcher for the Atlanta Braves. As officers led Mr. Maniaci away, Mr. Peterson interfered, the police said, yelling, swearing and flailing his arms. Probation officials in Delaware, where the infant's death occurred, said that Mr. Peterson's future would depend on the outcome of the new case.</p>

        <p>NORWICH: UKRAINE SHIP FINDS HOME  Local officials are preparing to welcome the Ukrainian tall ship Bat'kivshchyna as it docks for the winter. The ship's captain, Dmytro Biriukovich, met with officials on Tuesday to cement a deal that will give the boat a free berth and utilities until it departs for tall ship festivities in the Great Lakes next spring. The ship, which persevered through numerous adversities on the way to the OpSail 2000 celebration in the summer, is in New London awaiting dry-dock space for repairs.</p>
