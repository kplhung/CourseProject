        <p>DURING every Olympics, in a tradition as hallowed as the torch, viewers encounter a new set of pictograms: that menu of symbols representing the events of the Games. These abstract figures are meant to be legible to athletes and fans of any nation -- a visual Esperanto.</p>
        <p>No United Nations committee tracks user irritation, but almost everyone these days seems to harbor a festering resentment toward one symbol or another. If these symbols are so universal, why do they need to be reinvented every four years?</p>
        <p>In fact, universality is no longer the ambition of Olympic designers; reflecting local geography is. ''Each Olympics gets a new set of pictograms,'' said Paul Saunders of Saunders Creative, the pictogram designer for the Sydney Olympics, ''because, abstract as they are, they are supposed to reflect the Olympic location.''</p>
        <p>''Communicate globally, but stylize locally'' is his method. So he substitutes a stylized boomerang -- the logo for the down-under games -- for any generic representation of the human torso. That some of the iconographic athletes appear to be wearing harem pants is a minor distraction.</p>
        <p>''Designing these icons has become something like the Olympics of graphic design,'' said Tucker Viemeister, an industrial designer.</p>
        <p>On signs, computer screens, phones and instrument panels, baffling glyphs and symbols are increasingly irritating facts of daily life. The little shape on my cell phone's screen looks like a martini glass, but it signifies signal strength. What appears to be a cartoon hair dryer on my dashboard is supposed to be an internationally recognized symbol for traction control. When the singer Prince not long ago abandoned his glyph and reverted to the alphabetic version of his name, I took hope that other symbols, icons and pictograms might disappear as well. From such overused elements as the @ in e-mail addresses to the constantly changing meaning of the # sign on the telephone, visual symbols have become so abstract they no longer make sense.</p>
        <p>Gavin Ivester, a Nike designer who once worked on prototype symbols for Apple's Newton computer, likes to refer to the buttons that regulate the seat heaters in his old BMW: a single wavy arrow means ''low'' while three wavy arrows mean ''high.'' ''It's been a joke in this car,'' he said. ''Do you want one snake back there or three?''</p>
        <p>Some symbols have different meanings in different contexts. An icon on a photocopier that looks like a pile of cannonballs signals insufficient toner. On a road map, it is a standard symbol for historical ruins.</p>
        <p>Edward Tenner, the author of ''Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences'' (A. A. Knopf, 1996), terms the drive for global visual symbols ''glyphomania.''</p>
        <p>''The great force behind glyphomania is not efficiency but idealism, the search for a transcultural language,'' he said. ''The global triumph of English makes this quest less functionally necessary but more diplomatically desirable.''</p>
        <p>Idealism also inspired the designers at Xerox who created the first graphics for computers in the 1970's. They believed that icons were intuitive and thus easy to master. But increasingly, the global economy is highlighting local differences. For example, in China, a red traffic light means go.</p>
        <p>Like Esperanto, the ideal of international iconism has come to seem quaint, and the footless, handless figures marking restrooms and street  crossings seem like relics of the 1960's. Mr. Viemeister notes that young designers regularly parody such symbols on everything from skateboards to CD cases.</p>
        <p>In the Egypt of the pharaohs, Semitic scribes (think Moses) became fed up with the increasingly cumbersome hieroglyphs of the high priests. So they turned to an informal new kind of writing that became the forerunner of the phonetic alphabet. That system served civilization so well that it lasted thousands of years.</p>
        <p>It has taken us only a few years of playing with new glyphs to suspect that the scribes might have been right after all.</p>
        <p>DESIGN NOTEBOOK  Correction:  October 5, 2000, Thursday  The Design Notebook column last Thursday, about annoyance over cryptic Olympic pictograms and other icons, misstated the meaning of a red traffic light in China. It means stop. During the Cultural Revolution 30 years ago, an effort was made to change the meaning to ''go,'' but the idea did not take hold.</p>
