        <p>Reviving a battle between two of Europe's biggest luxury goods groups that had seemed resolved, a Dutch court today ordered a review of a decision last year that had allowed the sale of a $3 billion controlling stake in the Gucci Group to Pinault-Printemps-Redoute of France.</p>
        <p>Gucci, which is based in the Netherlands for tax reasons, but operates out of Italy, had agreed to the deal with Pinault to thwart a hostile bid by the luxury-goods maker LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, which had earlier acquired a sizable stake in Gucci. The decision last year diluted the LVMH stake to about 20 percent.</p>
        <p>In its decision last year, a lower Dutch court criticized Gucci's management for its handling of the battle against LVMH, controlled by the French billionaire Bernard Arnault, but refused to stop the deal with Pinault or to order an investigation of Gucci's management procedures, as LVMH had demanded. LVMH had protested that Gucci's deal with Pinault diluted LVMH's share in Gucci and denied it a seat on the Gucci board, something LVMH had sought. By contrast, Pinault secured the right to nominate four of Gucci's nine board members.</p>
        <p>Today's decision opened the door for LVMH to refile its case against Gucci and Pinault, which is controlled by Mr. Arnault's archrival, the French billionaire Francois Pinault. In a statement, LVMH said it would seek a full court investigation of Gucci's handling of the LVMH bid, the annulment of the deal with Pinault, and ''appropriate measures to remedy the harm caused by the improper conduct of Gucci's management.'' But the possibility of appeals and counterappeals made any early solution to the smoldering conflict unlikely.</p>
        <p>The skirmish with LVMH, which pits two of France's richest and most powerful businessmen against each other, has cost Gucci's management time and money. Still, the decision today nudged Gucci's share price up 3 percent, to 117.70 euros, on speculation that Gucci, already a darling of investors, might again have its share price driven up as the target in a revived bidding war between LVMH and Pinault.</p>
        <p>Shares in LVMH, which has already amassed about 1 billion euros, or $880 million, in capital gains from the appreciation of its Gucci shares, rose by more than 2 percent, to 85 euros. Shares in Pinault, which controls one of France's biggest department store chains, fell almost 3 percent, to 198 euros.</p>
        <p>LVMH has always insisted it would do nothing to harass Gucci, so as not to jeopardize the value of its Gucci stake. Yet LVMH has three other legal challenges pending in the Netherlands, one demanding annulment of the Pinault deal and another seeking damages or a court order requiring that Pinault bid for all Gucci shares. A third case seeks the annulment of decisions taken at a Gucci shareholder meeting last year approving the Pinault deal.</p>
        <p>Both companies claimed victory.</p>
        <p>LVMH, in its statement, said that if fresh hearings led to a cancellation of the Pinault deal, it would seek a solution ''in the interest of all shareholders that would enable Gucci to continue to execute its strategy, while remaining entirely independent.'' It did not elaborate.</p>
        <p>Serge Weinberg, Pinault's chief executive, said that nothing in today's decision ''posed an obstacle to the pursuit of the development of the Gucci group; we are extremely confident.''</p>
