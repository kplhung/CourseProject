        <p>A foundation controlled by a real estate speculator convicted last year in a Brooklyn bid-rigging scheme stands to earn $700,000 from a complex real estate deal backed by the Giuliani administration.</p>
        <p>The city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, moved to block the deal yesterday, citing ''a history of corruption.''</p>
        <p>The windfall would be the result of a $175.9 million plan by the city's Department of Homeless Services to pay a nonprofit group to buy an abandoned former knitting factory at 89-111 Porter Avenue in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. The group would convert it into a 400-bed homeless shelter, which it would operate for 22 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi said there was no evidence to suggest wrongdoing by the Doe Fund, the Manhattan nonprofit group that would set up the shelter. But the Doe Fund intends to buy the building indirectly from Abraham Jay Weiss, a real estate speculator who pleaded guilty in June 1999 to federal charges that he and 12 others conspired to depress bids submitted at Brooklyn real estate auctions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss and the foundation he and his wife recently established would earn at least $700,000 from the transaction. Mr. Weiss invested $12,000 last year to buy the dilapidated factory, Mr. Hevesi said.</p>
        <p>He said he also objected to the accelerated bidding process used by the Giuliani administration to select the Doe Fund, saying there was no justifiable reason not to have applied the city's usual contracting rules.</p>
        <p>''We are not alleging criminality, but we do have a number of serious issues that have been raised about the transaction,'' Mr. Hevesi said. ''If somebody has a history of corruption, we don't do business with them.''</p>
        <p>His objections reignited an eight-month feud between Mr. Hevesi and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The two have been sparring over $104 million in welfare-to-work contracts that the comptroller's office has said were improperly awarded to a Virginia company. The mayor has said that Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat, is using the contracts for political ends as he prepares a mayoral campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani again accused Mr. Hevesi of playing politics yesterday and defended the homeless shelter contract. The mayor's staff announced late yesterday that Mr. Giuliani would order the comptroller to approve the contract, a step the City Charter allows him to take even if the comptroller objects.</p>
        <p>''It is a perfectly normal, perfectly valid transaction,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss, who did not respond to a message left at his home, was sentenced in June 1999 to a year of probation and four months of home confinement for his role in the bid-rigging conspiracy. The group, according to the authorities, agreed not to bid against each other, lowering the price the banks earned on about 200 residential properties they sold from 1986 to 1990 in an effort to collect on delinquent mortgages.</p>
        <p>George T. McDonald, who founded the Doe Fund 15 years ago and is its president, said that he had never met Mr. Weiss and that until Mr. Hevesi raised his objections, he was not aware of his criminal conviction. He added that it was irrelevant.</p>
        <p>The Doe Fund operates the Ready, Willing and Able program at three locations in the New York City area. The program provides housing, employment and counseling to about 400 men with a long history of homelessness, incarceration and substance abuse. An appraisal of the property by Chase Manhattan Bank placed its value at $2.5 million -- the price the Doe Fund intends to pay, Mr. McDonald said.</p>
        <p>''What do I care what he has done before, as long as Chase says the property is worth what it is he is asking for it,'' Mr. McDonald said, referring to Mr. Weiss.</p>
        <p>Scott S. Markowitz, a lawyer representing Mr. Weiss's real estate company, said that when Mr. Weiss bought the former factory, he had not known the Doe Fund would soon be looking for a building to convert into a shelter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss bought the building in March 1999, three months before the city announced that it was seeking contractors to operate homeless shelters that would replace the 850-bed 30th Street Men's Shelter near Bellevue Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>On July 27, two days before the city moved to foreclose on about $1.5 million worth of tax liens on the former factory, Mr. Weiss declared his company bankrupt, preventing the action. On July 30, the Doe Fund applied to the city to use the Porter Street building as a homeless shelter.</p>
        <p>Of the $2.5 million purchase price, about $1.6 million would be used to settle past-due taxes, another $200,000 would cover various fees and $8,000 would go directly to Mr. Weiss and his wife, Yitta Weiss, Mr. Markowitz said. The remaining $700,000 would be given to the A.J.Y.W. Foundation of 543 Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, which the couple set up in 1998 to benefit local religious and nonprofit groups.</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Hevesi's objections, Mr. Markowitz said, ''I think it is clearly a political move when he is trying to run for mayor; it has nothing to do with reality.''</p>
        <p>Federal tax records show that the foundation, which listed $41,000 in assets as of October 1999, made $5,250 in donations in the previous 12 months, to 16 groups, including Talmudical Seminary of Heyward Street in Brooklyn, and Rav Tov International Rescue Organization in Brooklyn, which aids immigrants. But Mr. Hevesi said there was nothing to prevent Mr. Weiss from spending the foundation's money to pay himself and his wife a salary.</p>
        <p>''We are extremely troubled that D.H.S. is willing to proceed with this transaction fully cognizant that a convicted felon will make a windfall profit of between $700,000 and $1 million on his purchase of a property,'' Mr. Hevesi said in a letter to the mayor yesterday.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Hevesi said yesterday that because the comptroller had not yet received Mr. Giuliani's order to approve the contract, he was not sure what his next step would be. But the comptroller disputed suggestions that his motivations were political.</p>
        <p>''We had no choice but to object,'' Mr. Hevesi said, saying the contract should be rebid.</p>
