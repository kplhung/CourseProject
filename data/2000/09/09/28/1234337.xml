        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH has finally made government the issue of the presidential campaign.

        <p>Mr. Bush is picking up, of course, from the legacy of Ronald Reagan, who was determined to bench government as long as he could. President Reagan helped make entrepreneurialism and profits respectable again, which was no small achievement. And some deflation of government was no doubt deserved. In the 1960's and 1970's, advocates of progressive actions underestimated how difficult such tasks as reducing poverty and revitalizing the inner cities really were, and did not take sufficient care to develop new policies that would be effective.

        <p>GEORGE W. BUSH has finally made government the issue of the presidential campaign.

        <p>Mr. Bush is picking up, of course, from the legacy of Ronald Reagan, who was determined to bench government as long as he could. President Reagan helped make entrepreneurialism and profits respectable again, which was no small achievement. And some deflation of government was no doubt deserved. In the 1960's and 1970's, advocates of progressive actions underestimated how difficult such tasks as reducing poverty and revitalizing the inner cities really were, and did not take sufficient care to develop new policies that would be effective. Americans also overestimated the nation's potential affluence. Remember guns and butter?</p>
        <p>But the oversimplified fear of big government has been damaging and does not accurately reflect American history. On the crucial role of government in the nation's economic success, our past is unambiguous. Beginning with Jefferson's presidency, the federal government may have resisted building a national system of roads, but by the 1820's the states picked up the ball. Led by New York, the states invested millions of dollars, which was big money then, in new canals, and New York even made loans to business. Where would the early economy have been without these canals?</p>
        <p>In those same years, federal laws were  passed to protect the rights to the ownership of property for millions of Americans, including squatters, even though it violated the sanctity of the contracts the nation's rich landowners held. To Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian development specialist and author of ''The Mystery of Capital'' (Basic Books), America's far-seeing protection of property rights was a key to economic success.</p>
        <p>Before the Civil War, there was a pitched battle over whether primary education should remain private, but public education thankfully prevailed, and America became the best-educated nation in the world. Now, economists believe educational attainment is the foremost economic resource of a nation.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 1800's, the federal government aggressively subsidized the building of the railroads. After a couple of decades of a simplistic Social Darwinian ideology of ''survival of the fittest'' at the end of the 19th century, the progressives established regulations that made competition fairer and protected workers from abusive hours and labor conditions.</p>
        <p>In the early 1900's, local governments built much-needed high schools. In the 1930's, Social Security and unemployment insurance were introduced over the vehement objections of conservatives. And after World War II, the federal government was responsible for the highway system, the G.I. Bill of Rights, the Pentagon-sponsored research that resulted in the Internet, and civil rights legislation that helped bring African-Americans into the economic fold.</p>
        <p>The record is plain: government has done many things awfully well. And beyond the historical evidence, there is also strong statistical support for the idea that government investment has produced substantial returns. Ishaq Nadiri, an economist at New York University, has developed with colleagues a provocative model of public investment that is widely accepted. Their research shows that the return on federal transportation investment, for example, has been every bit as strong as the returns on private investment in recent years (and even stronger in the past) because such investment benefits society as a whole.</p>
        <p>Economic theory is consistent with Professor Nadiri's findings. Private investors will systematically underinvest in areas in which such social returns exceed private returns because the individual companies themselves will not enjoy all the benefits. Good theory, then, tells us that investments in public goods, from roads, sewers and airports to research and education, cannot be completely entrusted to private markets.</p>
        <p>Since the Reagan era began, America has largely neglected many of these areas. Of course, government will make mistakes (so does business). But consider that federal investment in transportation, research and development and education and training has fallen to only 1.7 percent of G.D.P., 30 percent lower than it was in 1970. At former levels, it would have been roughly an additional $100 billion of spending a year.</p>
        <p>The new economy is also creating new needs that are going unmet. Paying down the nation's debt is apparently our priority, but two-worker families desperately need quality day care. The information age requires even better education, but according to Richard Rothstein and Karen Hawley Miles, both education specialists, schools have increased inflation-adjusted spending per pupil since the late 1960's by only 1 percent a year, much less than the growth of the economy.</p>
        <p>What does the low level of teachers' salaries say about our society? Nancy Folbre, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, argues that such caring professions, including nursing and caring for the elderly, are themselves public goods that require serious government assistance.</p>
        <p>And, although deregulation and privatization have been useful, regulatory vigilance cannot simply be relaxed across the board as the economy changes. What are we to make of deregulation in a time when tire companies neglect safety standards, and the number of product recalls continues to set records? Despite the dangerous collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Investment Capital two years ago, no new requirements for public disclosure of financial information are in the works.</p>
        <p>Both business and government have vital roles in the economy, and always have. But for many people, government has become an us-versus-them issue. For the sake of the nation's economy, the next president should realize that the government is us.</p>
