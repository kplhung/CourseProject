        <p>A new Web feature lets you compare TV commercials and pick a candidate: Ike or Adlai. The Living Room Candidate, an online version of a 1992 exhibition at the American Museum of the Moving Image (ammi.org), has compiled television campaign ads for presidential elections from 1952 to the present. The highlights include campy cartoons from the 1952 Eisenhower-Stevenson race and infamous attack ads from the campaigns of Lyndon B. Johnson (the ad that showed a little girl picking the petals of a daisy -- until a nuclear bomb exploded) and George Bush (the Willie Horton ad). The Desktop Candidate area links to sites with TV ads from the 2000 race and archives with the 1996 campaigns' online efforts. Carl Goodman, the museum's curator of digital media, said visitors could examine ''parallels between how politicians started to use the then-new medium of television and the kind of baby steps that are being taken now on the Internet.''</p>
