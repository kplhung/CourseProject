        <p>IF you have spent an extended period of time in the company of children (five minutes should suffice), you will understand the full scope of the tactical error I made soon after the foot-powered-scooter craze reached my neighborhood: I bought one for my family to share.</p>
        <p>With a zeal more typical of novices in a convent, two of my daughters immediately vowed to abandon all other modes of transportation in favor of a life devoted to a shiny chrome scooter. I have not had a moment's peace since Ella, 9, drew up an Official Schedule of Scooter Turns and posted copies in every room of the house. Although Zoe, 11, agreed in theory to restrictive conditions that included ''blackout dates'' on holidays, negotiations threatened to break down last week after an allegation of an unauthorized glide around a Dead End sign.</p>
        <p>To their credit, nobody's arm got pinched. Instead they started haggling for the purchase of a second scooter, offering in return personal services in the form of ''free baby-sitting.'' Having seen their work (I recently returned home to find the baby wearing nothing but a single patent-leather party shoe and applying blue nail polish to a cat), I was leery. However, I had made last-minute dinner plans but had no baby-sitter. And, really, the cat looked fine after a bath.</p>
        <p>So although I have spent enough time with children to suspect that once the scooter shortage eased so would my daughters' interest in the vehicles, I did a quick online search and found prices for the Razor miniscooter hovering in a range from $79.99 (at Kmart's Bluelight.com) to $99.99 (at Thesportsauthority.com). Could I beat that? I decided to try my own skills of negotiation, by bartering at a site called Hagglezone.com (hagglezone).</p>
        <p>At Hagglezone.com, shoppers can negotiate prices on nearly 1,000 items in 16 categories, from computers to luggage to toys. Each item has a sticker price -- the scooter was $99 -- that serves as a starting point for bargaining. The selection includes a hodgepodge of Scooby Doo dinnerware sets ($17), semi-pro karaoke singing machines ($329) and dumbbell racks ($149), a jumble that heightens the feeling of wandering through an open-air bazaar.</p>
        <p>But you don't haggle with a human; at Hagglezone.com a software application does all the negotiating, after taking into consideration such factors as a shopper's bidding history and pattern of negotiation, the availability of inventory and a database of previous sales.</p>
        <p>Unlike other negotiating sites like Nextag.com (where you bargain simultaneously with multiple merchants) and Mercata.com (where prices drop as demand for an item increases), Hagglezone.com puts a human face on the software. Shoppers choose to barter with one of six fictional hagglers, each of whom has a name like Monte or Vince or Dot, and a personality description along the lines of ''Sharp as a tack and ready to cut a deal.''</p>
        <p>The hagglers' moods shift, depending on the credibility of your offers. If their little thumbnail photos start to show frowns instead of smiles, they may be on the verge of ending a negotiation by announcing, ''I've gotta boot you out, Slatalla. Don't wanna, but gotta.''</p>
        <p>It sounded corny (Don't wanna, but gotta?), but I wanted the scooter. And if I could get it cheap, then I wouldn't feel so bad buying an item doomed to sit ignored in the shed.</p>
        <p>Realizing how dumb my position seemed, I sought support for my desire to beat the system. I phoned Susan Porter Benson, an associate professor of history at the University of Connecticut whose research explores the habits of consumers.</p>
        <p>She said my motivation was the same honorable one that prompted hagglers for centuries. ''If my grandma were still around, she'd be right on there, haggling,'' said Professor Benson, the author of ''Counter Cultures: Saleswomen, Managers, and Customers in American Department Stores, 1890-1940'' (University of Illinois Press, 1986). ''If you just buy something for a fixed price, you haven't accomplished anything, but if you haggle, you have been in some kind of a battle and you have prevailed.''</p>
        <p>I registered at Hagglezone.com, which took about 30 seconds and required no personal information except an e-mail address. Then I clicked on Monte. (''He'll make you laugh, he'll make you cry. He's Monte, self-proclaimed 'Deal Maker of the Century.' '')</p>
        <p>Monte, meet Michelle. (She's cranky and would rather be buying a margarita blender for herself.) Here is a partial transcript of our negotiation.</p>
        <p>Monte: ''What a kick to have you in the HaggleZone for the first time, Slatalla! 3! 35! Set! Hut! Hut! Go long with an offer of $94.35!!''</p>
        <p>Me: $55.</p>
        <p>Monte: ''What's the offer du jour? How 'bout $84.37?''</p>
        <p>Me: $58.</p>
        <p>After eight bids, with Monte stalled at $69.92 and me at $63, the software booted me. But I wasn't defeated because Hagglezone.com does not penalize bidders for failing to make a deal; I could repeat the negotiation as many times as I wanted, with any of the six hagglers I chose. In fact, when I phoned Charlie Reynolds, a spokesman for Hagglezone.com's owner, One2OneDynamics Inc., he told me that reluctant shoppers may end up softening the software's stance. ''If it's been nine times and you still haven't bought anything, it's eager to make you happy,'' Mr. Reynolds said.</p>
        <p>After bartering with the other hagglers, I realized the software tended to drop the price in increments of slightly less than $10 before all stalling somewhere between $69.92 and $70.52.</p>
        <p>I changed my strategy by increasing bids by $5 increments to persuade the hagglers that I was serious. All six eventually agreed to sell the scooter to me for $65, plus $9.95 for shipping. (Mr. Reynolds said the software sets a bottom line price for each item, which varies greatly depending on factors like popularity, availability and previous sale prices.) I couldn't get them to go any lower. So although I didn't feel as much personal satisfaction from battling an algorithm as I would a human, I bought the scooter.</p>
        <p>And in retrospect, I think I am better off bargaining against software than the crafty human negotiators I faced later. Somehow, I agreed to pay for a new bottle of blue nail polish. Don't wanna. Gotta.</p>
