        <p>Summit Bancorp, the largest bank in New Jersey, is in talks to be acquired by the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, executives close to the discussions said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The executives would not disclose the terms of the deal, but analysts estimated the bank could be sold for $7 billion, or $40 a share.</p>
        <p>Shares of Summit, which is based in Princeton, rose $3.56 yesterday, to $34.31, and are up 25 percent this week on speculation of a deal.</p>
        <p>Summit, with just $39 billion in assets and more than 500 branches, would be a small bite for Fleet, which has assets of $181 billion. But the deal could help Fleet increase its market share in the New York area, a goal of Fleet's chief executive, Terrence Murray. Summit controls 15.6 percent of New Jersey's deposits, more than double the share of Fleet, which has had a presence in the state since it bought NatWest Bancorp in 1996.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for both sides declined to comment, although the Fleet spokesman noted that the company was no longer distracted by its $13 billion merger a year ago with the BankBoston Corporation.</p>
        <p>''The merger is complete,'' said James Mahoney, the spokesman.</p>
        <p>In another deal pending in the New York area, Fleet has agreed to invest $250 million should North Fork Bancorp succeed in its $2 billion hostile bid for Dime Bancorp. In return, North Fork, which is scheduled to decide today whether to proceed with its takeover bid, has promised to sell 17 Dime branches to Fleet.</p>
        <p>''For years people have been talking about Fleet and Summit,'' said Lawrence Cohn, an analyst with Ryan, Beck &amp; Company. ''Fleet is at a size in this market where either they need to get bigger or get out.'' With one-third of Summit's branches in the suburbs of New York City, Fleet could market to an affluent customer base products sold by its subsidiaries, the high-technology investment banking firm Robertson Stephens and the discount broker Quick &amp; Reilly.</p>
        <p>Summit has been seen as a takeover target since at least 1992, when a predecessor company was the target of a proxy fight by Chilmark Capital, a money management firm in Saddle River, N.J., which owned 10 percent of the stock. At the time, it was the largest bank holding company to fend off a proxy fight, a Summit spokeswoman said. Eight years later, the pool of potential acquirers has narrowed considerably, noted Neil Weisman, president of Chilmark, who sold his stock soon after his proxy battle failed. ''Fleet is the logical choice,'' Mr. Weisman said.</p>
        <p>Merrill Lynch has been trying to drum up interest from other potential buyers, executives close to the deal said, but the list of banks with a stock price strong enough to afford the deal and with a presence in the New York area is fairly small. The First Union Corporation, which was said to be interested when Mr. Weisman was lobbying for Summit's sale, would most likely have antitrust problems if it tried to acquire Summit. In the late 1990's, First Union greatly expanded its presence in the  area with the acquisition of the Core States Financial Corporation and First Fidelity Bancorp, Mr. Cohn said.</p>
        <p>In a note to clients yesterday, Judah Kraushaar, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said, ''The main issue for Fleet in judging potential investor reaction will be whether a deal with Summit waters down Fleet's efforts to move away from traditional banking and towards higher-valuation businesses'' like investment banking.</p>
        <p>Fleet has already said it was evaluating a partial spinoff of Robertson. So far, investors do not seem too concerned: Fleet's shares closed at $39, up 31 cents. A spokesman for Merrill declined to comment on the firm's role in any deal; Mr. Kraushaar did not return calls.</p>
