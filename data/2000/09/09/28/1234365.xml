        <p>Offering more reasons than remorse, Marty McSorley testified today that his stick-swinging against Donald Brashear in a game last year was little more than an unfortunate accident between National Hockey League enforcers.</p>
        <p>Led by the questioning of his lawyer, Bill Smart, McSorley spent the entire third day of his trial on the witness stand and attacked the assault charge. At issue is whether violence in a hockey game can constitute criminal assault, but McSorley labeled such a confrontation as common when emotions on the ice run high.</p>

        <p>Offering more reasons than remorse, Marty McSorley testified today that his stick-swinging against Donald Brashear in a game last year was little more than an unfortunate accident between National Hockey League enforcers.</p>
        <p>Led by the questioning of his lawyer, Bill Smart, McSorley spent the entire third day of his trial on the witness stand and attacked the assault charge. At issue is whether violence in a hockey game can constitute criminal assault, but McSorley labeled such a confrontation as common when emotions on the ice run high.</p>
        <p>McSorley testified that he did not mean to smash Brashear's head with the blade of his stick in a game last Feb. 21 and that a combination of bad aim and bad luck, including the path Brashear took, contributed to the seriousness of the incident.</p>
        <p>McSorley admitted wanting to provoke a second fight late in the game -- McSorley, then a defenseman with the Boston Bruins, and Brashear, playing for the Vancouver Canucks, had fought in the first period -- and send a larger message to the Canucks that the Bruins were playing until the final horn of a 5-2 loss.</p>
        <p>''I had told him, 'Donald, you're going to have to fight me again,' '' McSorley testified. ''He said: 'We're up 4-0. I don't have to fight you.' ''</p>
        <p>Brashear, 28, a wing who was in his seventh season in the N.H.L., hit the back of his head on the ice after McSorley hit him, got a concussion, lost consciousness briefly while on the ice and suffered lapses in memory. He returned to play several weeks later.</p>
        <p>McSorley received the biggest fine and suspension in N.H.L. history, $72,000 and the final 23 games of last season. McSorley, now a free agent, must meet with Commissioner Gary Bettman if he is to play again.</p>
        <p>Closing arguments are scheduled for Thursday before Judge William Kitchen of Provincial Court, who is expected to render his decision on Friday. If convicted, McSorley could be sentenced to up to 18 months in prison.</p>
        <p>Smart argued today that injuries to McSorley's left shoulder and wrist affected control of his stick and caused him to miss his target, which McSorley described as shoulder level, just above the number on Brashear's right sleeve. McSorley, 37, has since had surgery on his shoulder and said doctors recommended that his wrist needs fusing.</p>
        <p>''Did I think I was going to miss?'' he said. ''No, it never entered my mind. I've never missed like that before.''</p>
        <p>Mike Hicks, the regional prosecutor for Vancouver, hammered on McSorley's talent and work ethic, which have produced a 17-year career in the N.H.L. Hicks also contended that as a veteran player, McSorley should have easily adjusted to Brashear's change in position on the ice, and noted that Brashear said he did not want to fight.</p>
        <p>McSorley responded that his action was an instinctive move to lure Brashear into another fight, then engaged in a heated exchange with Hicks.</p>
        <p>''Mr. McSorley, are you responsible for your stick on the ice?'' Hicks said.</p>
        <p>''You do the best you can,'' McSorley said.</p>
        <p>Hicks repeated the question in a firmer voice.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Hicks, do you know how many guys get cut over the course of the season?'' McSorley said.</p>
        <p>''Mr. McSorley,'' Hicks said, ''how many players get hit with a stick across their head and get knocked unconscious during a season?''</p>
        <p>''There's been instances, yes.''</p>
        <p>When Hicks accused McSorley of deliberately attacking Brashear in anger, McSorley said, ''Mr. Hicks, that is absolutely not true and there has been no indication of that in any way.''</p>
        <p>McSorley and Smart explained that McSorley's hands never came together on his stick, a distinction to show he did not maliciously grip the stick to use it as a weapon.</p>
        <p>McSorley testified that he intended to hit Brashear with the shaft, a foot or so above the blade, in the manner of a cross-check, and thought that was what he had done. The slow-motion videotape, though, clearly showed McSorley striking Brashear with the heel of the blade.</p>
        <p>''What I see, as Donald comes across me, the harder he cuts, the more he bends his knees and the more he tilts his shoulder,'' McSorley said.</p>
        <p>Wayne Gretzky, who is not expected to be called as a witness, created a buzz outside the courtroom when he arrived at McSorley's trial. At one point, deputies taped white paper over the small courtroom window to keep a growing crowd from trying to catch a glimpse of Gretzky.</p>
        <p>''I'm here to support my friend,'' said Gretzky, who played with McSorley on the Edmonton Oilers' championship teams of the 1980's.</p>
