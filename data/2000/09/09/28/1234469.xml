        <p>DONO-Maryann, RN, BSN, MA, GOING-Mary Ann, RN, BSN, MA, MOLLICK - Kathleen, BSN WALSH-Joan E., RN.C, BA, MA. The Board of Directors of Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers, and the Sisters of Charity, Hospital Auxiliary, Administration, Medical Staff and Hospital Staff of Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers-Saint Vincent's Manhattan, mourn the passing of our beloved colleagues and dear friendsMaryann Dono, Mary Ann Going, Kathleen Mollick and Joan Ellen Walsh. These dedicated women, all graduates of our St. Vincent's School of Nursing, spent their entire careers serving patients at St. Vincent's Hospital. They were the very essence of our mission. Together, these four nurses served the Hospital for 160 years. Their common bond in caring for sick children brought them together, as they all served in our Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Services. The entire Saint Vincents' family extends its deepest condolences to the family members of each of these outstanding women. Their loss will be deeply felt by grateful patients and their families, and the countless number of colleagues that they have mentored for more than 40 years. We will miss them deeply. David J. Campbell, President &amp; CEO Saint Vincents Catholic Medical Centers Jane Connorton, President, St. Vincent's Manhattan</p>
