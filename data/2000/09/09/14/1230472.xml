        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration plans to announce on Thursday that it will require replacement of the rudder control system on the Boeing  737, the most widely used airliner in the world.</p>
        <p>The agency concluded that safety improvements were still needed  even after three orders were issued to airlines in recent years to change hardware and emergency procedures were developed for pilots to use if the rudders failed.</p>
        <p>A rudder malfunction was blamed for the crash of USAir Flight 427, which flipped and plunged to earth on approach to Pittsburgh International Airport six years ago, killing all 132 people on board. It is also suspected in the crash of United Airlines Flight 585 in March 1991, a Boeing 737 that came down on approach to the airport in Colorado Springs, killing all 25 aboard.</p>
        <p>But aviation experts continue to characterize rudder problems on the plane as rare.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. intends to issue an order by next July that will specify what changes will be needed and will require finishing the changes within three to five years. Planes coming off the assembly line will have to comply sooner.</p>
        <p>The decision is a reversal for the agency, which had previously argued that smaller changes in hardware and procedures would suffice. Even after the flaw that caused the Pittsburgh crash was demonstrated, senior agency officials argued that the existing system was reliable and that a new system could conceivably have a higher failure rate.</p>
        <p>The roughly 1,500 Boeing 737's registered in this country would be covered directly by the order and most of the 2,000 registered in other countries would be as well because regulators abroad typically adopt the same rules as the F.A.A. for American-built planes. The number of planes in service and the expected scope of the work are likely to make this one of the biggest orders affecting planes in service, aviation officials said.</p>
        <p>But the design of the new system is ''still a work in progress,'' said Diane Spitaliere, an F.A.A. spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>And even when the new system is completed, the agency will take some time to approve it, aviation officials said.</p>
        <p>It is also unclear what the changes will cost, ''other than the fact that it's going to be expensive,'' said David Fuscus, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, the trade group of the major airlines. In such cases the cost is typically shared by airlines and the aircraft makers.</p>
        <p>In the Pittsburgh case, investigators believe that a malfunction in the hydraulic system made the rudder swing all the way to one side and stick. When the plane's design was first approved, engineers believed that the control system was redundant, meaning that there were two separate control systems and one would take over if the other failed. The system used two valves, one sliding back and forth within the other.</p>
        <p>But after years of investigation, engineers concluded that they had been wrong. One sliding valve could fail without any sign and if it did so in one particular position, the other half could fail later and produce ''rudder reversal,'' which would swing the rudder hard to the opposite side from what the pilot intended.</p>
        <p>The new design will be fully redundant, Ms. Spitaliere said.</p>
        <p>Aviation experts said the new design would involve two separate valves, and if one was to jam, the pilots could free the rudder mechanism by stomping hard on the foot pedals that control the rudder. That is similar to the system in use on Boeing 757's and 767's.</p>
        <p>The order will also require changes in maintenance procedures to increase the possibility of finding failures before they cause a problem.</p>
        <p>Before deciding to revise the control system, the F.A.A. had developed emergency procedures for use if the rudder control system failed, but even after training airline crews in a 737 simulator often ''crashed'' anyway.</p>
        <p>''It was ineffective, too cumbersome, too involved,'' Ms. Spitaliere  said.</p>
        <p>The agency has already ordered three changes in the rudder control hardware, and the deadline for completing them was last month. One limits the amount of hydraulic pressure in the system, so if there is a malfunction, the rudder would not be pushed all the way to one side. Another improves the reliability of a part called the yaw damper, an automatic system that moves the rudder rapidly in small increments to keep the plane from fishtailing. The third change was meant to improve the reliability of the hydraulic system.</p>
