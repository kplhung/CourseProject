        <p>WHAT right does that Tommy Haas have to be so smug? Look at him, with his cocky walk and his stupid baseball hat on backward, thinking he's so great because he slammed that ball past me and won the match.</p>
        <p>I could have made that shot, but just as I was making a desperate run for the ball, my wife walked in front of the TV and blocked my view. Tommy Haas never had to deal with something like that. You lucked out this time, Haas, but I'm hitting the Try Again button, and this time I am out for blood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haas, a real-life German tennis star, is one of an international all-male cast of players you can compete against in Sega's Virtua Tennis, an addictive game in which you can experience victory and defeat without getting off the couch. The players are remarkably lifelike, grunting when they serve, mopping up sweat between sets, going for the ball with desperate leaps that have them tumbling head over heels while the crowd gives a collective sigh.</p>
        <p>Virtual tennis looks so much like televised tennis, complete with slow-motion instant replays, that you could very well start to believe that you are seeing a real match.</p>
        <p>It is easy to forget that this is not a spectator sport. You can find yourself neglecting to control your player, staring at the screen and thinking: ''What's wrong with that guy? Why is he just standing there?''</p>
        <p>The game seems so athletic that after a while you may feel as though you are that testosterone-pumped player on the court rather than a couch potato with a game controller. You won't work up a sweat, but you may feel as though you have. You may even be convinced that you are getting physically stronger, faster and more muscular -- until you play a live game of tennis and discover that your muscles (except for those in your thumbs) have atrophied.</p>
        <p>Virtua Tennis is unlike most sports games in that you don't have to like sports to enjoy playing. The game is not so much a sports simulation as it is a retread of Pong, the game that began the video game craze in the 70's. Underneath all the bells and whistles, Virtua Tennis is a game about hitting a virtual representation of a ball with a virtual representation of a racket, an activity that has lost none of its charm in the last two and a half decades.</p>
        <p>Like Pong, the game is simplicity itself. Direction keys run your player across the court, and pushing a button makes him swing. If the ball is nearby, he will move toward it and hit; if it's a little too far away, he will jump for it. There is an incalculable pleasure in seeing your opponent dive for a well-placed ball and take a tumble, and a great frustration in doing so yourself.</p>
        <p>You choose a famous tennis player to play, and your choice affects your tennis form: Mark Philippoussis has a hard serve; Yevgeny Kafelnikov has a strong backhand. The effects are slight but noticeable.</p>
        <p>Your computer opponents will also vary. Some will play the net; some will volley; some will blast serves. Game play is also affected by the court you choose, with concrete giving you more bounce than clay or grass.</p>
        <p>Instead of playing against a computer opponent, you can choose to play against someone sitting next to you on that couch of yours. And since you can play singles or doubles matches, you can put four people on that couch, each with a controller.</p>
        <p>Here is where the Pong essence of Virtua Tennis comes into play: It isn't hard to persuade people to play with you, even those with little interest in video games. Virtua Tennis is easy to play and difficult to stop, mindless and engaging. It appeals to women as much as to men, to adults and to children.</p>
        <p>In a real game of tennis, you can attribute your losses to arbitrary factors: the sun got in your eyes, there was a pebble underfoot. Virtua Tennis also gives you problems beyond your control. Like real tennis, one side of the court is easier to play than the other, and you keep switching sides. The easy side is when your player has his back to you. On this side, movement is pretty natural, with the Up button moving you closer to the net, and the Down button moving you away. It's more difficult to play from the other side, where the controls are reversed. That gives you the opportunity to say, ''I could have made that shot.''</p>
        <p>In singles mode, you can switch to an alternate view when on the far side of the net, but in that view the ball is often off the screen, one of the game's few shortcomings. You'll want to practice on the far side anyway to train for those live competitions.</p>
        <p>Even when playing against the computer, you might feel as though you have a live opponent -- not because of the intelligence of the playing, although your computer opponents are frighteningly proficient, but because of those moments when they shake their heads after bad shots or pump their arms in excitement after good ones. These reaction shots give a heightened sense of reality and involvement; watching your opponent smirk after you miss an easy shot will make you wish that Virtua Tennis had included a way to throw your racket at the guy.</p>
        <p>When I won at an English tournament, I wasn't just beating a computer, I was teaching Tommy Haas a lesson. So what if I couldn't beat him in a real tennis match -- I'm sure I could destroy him in a game of Pong. Then he might not be so smug.</p>
