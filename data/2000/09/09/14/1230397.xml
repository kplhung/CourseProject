        <p>If it were a Hollywood production, ''The Plight of the Megaplex'' would be a tear-jerker starring companies brought to ruin because they sought to bring hourly show times, reclining seat backs, retractable armrests and stadium seating to every last corner of America.</p>
        <p>Movie theater chains have been building plush, massive ''megaplexes'' since 1995, when a 24-screen theater went up in Dallas. Customers seem to love them. While ''stadium seating'' may conjure up images of freezing temperatures, hard seats and fistfights at a professional football game, it actually means building theaters so as to enable all moviegoers to see the screen instead of only the back of someone's cranium. It is the most revolutionary film-exhibiting development to come along since the cup holder, which took the industry by storm in the early 1980's.</p>

        <p>If it were a Hollywood production, ''The Plight of the Megaplex'' would be a tear-jerker starring companies brought to ruin because they sought to bring hourly show times, reclining seat backs, retractable armrests and stadium seating to every last corner of America.</p>
        <p>Movie theater chains have been building plush, massive ''megaplexes'' since 1995, when a 24-screen theater went up in Dallas. Customers seem to love them. While ''stadium seating'' may conjure up images of freezing temperatures, hard seats and fistfights at a professional football game, it actually means building theaters so as to enable all moviegoers to see the screen instead of only the back of someone's cranium. It is the most revolutionary film-exhibiting development to come along since the cup holder, which took the industry by storm in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, these new facilities have been taking business away from the same operators' older screens, often located at mere ''multiplexes.''  There simply aren't enough customers to go around. Although the number of movie screens in the United States has more than doubled over the past two decades -- from 17,675 in 1980 to 37,185 in 1999 --  only 50 percent more tickets were sold last year than in 1980.</p>
        <p>Also, because theaters take a smaller slice of the box office in a movie's first weeks, putting the hottest movies on five screens with staggered starting hours may turn out to be a poor business strategy, insofar as it shortens a film's life span.</p>
        <p>The casualties are mounting. This year United Artists, Carmike Cinemas, Edwards Cinemas and Silver Cinemas have filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions. Loews Cineplex said on Aug. 25 that it might default on debt payments. Not even $5 bags of popcorn can stem the tide of red ink that resulted when these companies overbuilt to protect market share. The summer of 2000, short on blockbuster hits, proved little relief, with box office receipts down $210 million from last summer.</p>
        <p>Once the crisis is past, surviving movie theater chains will be left to confront the question haunting the 500-channel cable TV universe: Is there enough good material to put on all those screens?</p>
