        <p>Gov. George W. Bush aggressively challenged Vice President Al Gore today on one of his signature issues, calling Mr. Gore's commitment to the environment into question by saying that the Clinton administration had seriously neglected the upkeep of national parks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush proposed spending an additional $3.75 billion in federal money over five years to repair and maintain them. And he framed that plan in terms of his own love of the outdoors, which he extolled from the wooded banks of a salmon-filled river here.</p>
        <p>''Under this administration, the parks are in worse shape than ever before,'' said Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee. ''Sewage flows untreated into the lakes and streams of Yellowstone National Park. Civil War relics have been soaked by a leaky roof at Gettysburg.</p>
        <p>''For eight years,'' Mr. Bush added, ''this administration has talked of environmentalism while our national parks are crumbling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not stop there. He also lashed into Mr. Gore for not saying whether he supported breaching hydroelectric dams in Washington that have hindered spawning salmon. Environmentalists are pushing hard for such a measure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush opposes it, saying that technology should be developed to save both the dams and salmon, a position supported by many prominent Democratic officials in the state for economic reasons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who has courted the support of nationwide environmental groups, has said he would convene a summit of people on different sides of the issue to discuss possible resolutions.</p>
        <p>''He's refused to say whether he would breach the dams or not,'' Mr. Bush said today, after first emphasizing his concern for salmon. He was standing on a piece of private property that, with government aid, had established a kind of salmon nursery to feed and fatten the fish and increase their chances of surviving and reproducing.</p>
        <p>''Before the people of this good state vote,'' Mr. Bush said, ''I think you deserve an answer. I think you need to know where he stands on this important environmental issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had spent much of the past few weeks of the presidential campaign either on the defensive or immersed in subject matters unrelated to his chosen themes. But his strongly worded remarks were a clear attempt to seize the offensive against Mr. Gore and leave the vice president with some explaining to do. Mr. Bush was also tapping into issues of special concern to residents of Washington, the state on the West Coast that his aides feel he has the best chance of winning.</p>
        <p>At the least, the Bush campaign would like to do well enough along the West Coast, which Mr. Gore is counting on winning, to force the vice president to spend precious time and money here. After Washington, Mr. Bush was scheduled to spend two days in California.</p>
        <p>The environment is especially important to voters in this region and one reason they often tilt Democratic. But Mr. Bush has been devoting this entire week trying to blunt Democrats' typical advantages on health care, the environment and education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides said today that Mr. Bush's environmental record in Texas contradicted his claims. The Sierra Club, a liberal advocacy group, echoed that assessment, quickly issuing a statement that expressed deep skepticism about the genuineness of Mr. Bush's commitment to national parks.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign and the Sierra Club noted that Texas ranks near the bottom of states according to several environmental measures, including spending on parks. Mr. Gore's aides further noted that Mr. Bush supports oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a wilderness area that Mr. Gore has pledged to protect.</p>
        <p>''It's laughable that Bush would reinvent himself as an environmentalist,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides took issue with Mr. Bush's portrait of a national park system in decline. Literature distributed by the Bush campaign said that the Clinton administration, for the coming fiscal year, had requested a 22 percent decrease in financing for maintenance of national parks, to $180 million from $230 million.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's aides said that those figures ignored the fact that the administration had developed other sources of revenue, outside the appropriation process, for the maintenance of parks. They also said that the administration was spending much more on parks than the last Republican administration -- that of Mr. Bush's father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said the spending was too focused on converting more and more private land into public parks and that, as a result, there was a roughly $5 billion backlog of necessary maintenance work in parks. He said that he would eliminate this with the additional spending he was proposing, which he cast as a cultural and moral imperative.</p>
        <p>''Our national parks contain America's memories and America's grandeur,'' Mr. Bush said in a 13-minute speech rife with poetic flourishes. He read it from teleprompters, an incongruous addition to the sylvan surroundings.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor said that he also wanted to increase, to $38 million a year from $18 million, the federal spending on scientific surveys and monitoring of the land and water in national parks.</p>
        <p>But he said that while he welcomed federal responsibility for national parks, local wilderness areas and natural resources should be managed by local governments.</p>
        <p>Explaining the roots and the depth of his environmental sensitivities, he talked about his ranch in a remote, unspoiled patch of central Texas and of the many birds there.</p>
        <p>And he was close to rhapsodic in his praise of the salmon being nurtured in the nursery along the Skykomish River that he was visiting.</p>
        <p>''For all of us,'' he said, ''these fish are a wonder.''</p>
