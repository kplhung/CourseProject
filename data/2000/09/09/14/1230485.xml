        <p>IT would not have seemed possible before last night's Senate debate, not remotely possible that you could feel sympathy for Hillary Rodham Clinton --  tough-as-nails, implacable Hillary, of the Rose Law Firm and Travelgate and Whitewater and the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy.</p>
        <p>But when Tim Russert ran that tape of her from January 1998, defending her husband on the ''Today'' program against charges of sexual impropriety; and her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, hammered away at the issues of ''character and trust''; and then he marched over to her, demanding, like a Long Island Joe McCarthy, that she sign a pledge saying she never again would spend soft money, let's face it. The first lady was getting beaten up and except for the entrenched Hillary-haters, more than a few viewers probably felt a twinge of sympathy.</p>
        <p>We shouldn't. That's politics. Mrs. Clinton gets no more protection than any other candidate, should and probably does not expect special treatment as a woman or first lady, nor should voters take umbrage when she takes her knocks. Campaigns get nasty. Indeed, many times last night, Mrs. Clinton let Mr. Lazio have it, accusing him of ''chutzpah,'' and linking him time and again to Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>But this had a different quality to it. This was harsh and personal, this was wince-making, especially to hear her hesitate and watch her look down at her hands and reach for words, repeating ''you know'' over and over again as she tried to answer Mr. Russert about the ''Today'' program, saying ''Well, you know, Tim, that was a very, a very painful time for me, for my family and for our country.'' To his question about whether she would apologize for misleading the country, she said she didn't know the truth about her husband, which maybe was true, maybe was not.</p>
        <p>But you had to wish she would tell Mr. Russert: enough, it's none of your business. Except candidates, especially women, cannot lose their tempers with impunity.</p>
        <p>What does this all have to do with being a senator? With who won this debate? Probably very little. But extraordinary things happen in campaigns that reveal a great deal about this country and our politics, and this was one of those moments.</p>
        <p>It was a reminder that the playing field is not level and that there are unwritten rules for women in politics, still. Just as an aggressive female politician will be labeled shrill and unappealing while an aggressive man will be, well, manly and tough, a male candidate can't be too harsh toward a female opponent because he will come across as a bully. Same for the reporters. Mr. Russert was doing his job and did it well. But his style made this viewer, and surely others, cringe. Same for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Not fair, absolutely. Not fair. But that's how it is and that is why, we predict, the Russert-Clinton moment, followed by the Lazio paper-signing act, will be what most viewers take away from last night's debate in Buffalo.</p>
        <p>AS for the less-laden question of who won, who knows? We do know that New Yorkers should feel pretty good about the debate. It showed that they have two significant candidates with real differences between them. A choice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, who had to prove last night that he wasn't New York's Dan Quayle, held his own and then some, deflecting charges that he was a puppet of the Republican leadership and staking out positions on key issues. Mrs. Clinton, who had to show she wasn't Lady Macbeth, stuck to substance and was, if not relaxed and comfortable, prepared and in command.</p>
        <p>They disagreed on health care, education and fiscal policy. He's for vouchers, she isn't. He opposes casino gambling, she would support it if the community wanted it. Both object to the teachers strike in Buffalo, he more assertively than Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>They linked each other to other politicians: Mrs. Clinton aligning Mr. Lazio with Mr. Gingrich; Mr. Lazio blaming Mrs. Clinton for some of President Clinton's policies. And each played games with soft money. Mr. Lazio pushed his pledge, Mrs. Clinton said she'd tried to get a mutual soft money ban early on, and of course both are raising and spending all they can get.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio even tried to sound like the New York equivalent of a good old boy, quoting -- that is, misquoting -- Casey Stengel. ''I've delivered for New York,'' said the congressman. ''And as that old Yankee manager, Casey Stengel, used to say, 'You can check it out.' '' Actually, the line popularized by Casey Stengel is, ''You could look it up.''</p>
        <p>For an hour last night, New York was treated to a good political debate. Standard politics. Except for what was not, which, we suspect, is what we will remember.</p>
