        <p>When doctors, insurance agents and auto dealers form unions, organize boycotts and otherwise band together against larger corporate forces, economic changes are at work that can also alter the political landscape. Why are these groups of traditional Republican voters behaving like working-class Democrats of old? Because they face a greater threat to their livelihood than big government ever posed. And it could change their votes.</p>
        <p>The threat is from the large corporations with which these small businesses deal as franchisees, sales representatives and providers of health care. And it is a fight for their very survival. Not content with record profits derived from Wall Street, the sales floor and underwriting over the decade of the 90's, big business wants even more. It wants all the business now, even if that means competing against and destroying the very partners that made the big boys big in the first place.</p>

        <p>When doctors, insurance agents and auto dealers form unions, organize boycotts and otherwise band together against larger corporate forces, economic changes are at work that can also alter the political landscape. Why are these groups of traditional Republican voters behaving like working-class Democrats of old? Because they face a greater threat to their livelihood than big government ever posed. And it could change their votes.</p>
        <p>The threat is from the large corporations with which these small businesses deal as franchisees, sales representatives and providers of health care. And it is a fight for their very survival. Not content with record profits derived from Wall Street, the sales floor and underwriting over the decade of the 90's, big business wants even more. It wants all the business now, even if that means competing against and destroying the very partners that made the big boys big in the first place.</p>
        <p>My own industry is one example. The Big Three automakers are working actively in all 50 states to change dealer franchise laws that prohibit them from retailing directly to the public through the Internet and factory-owned stores. If the automakers' strategy is successful, they could eliminate or marginalize 20,000 dealerships, dramatically altering the lives of the one million people they employ and the welfare of thousands of communities. Bankruptcies and the selling off of capital built up by families over decades would precede the fundamentally new arrangement in the retail marketplace.</p>
        <p>In the travel industry, big companies' embrace of the Internet is already causing massive shakeouts. Travel agents are being squeezed as the public books directly with the airlines, hotels and Internet businesses. Airlines have cut the commissions of travel agents in half in a clear effort to eliminate their former business partners.</p>
        <p>A third industry following the trend is insurance. Big companies have pressed doctors, hospitals and consumers to the limit with scant reimbursements, poor service, rules that dictate which doctors can be used, and unjustified premium increases. More than one-third of hospitals nationwide are not profitable.  Group health premiums rose by 12 percent, on average, this last year.  My own small business's premiums went up 22 percent, and though the ostensible reason was spiraling health costs, my insurance company's net profits increased 53 percent.</p>
        <p>There is also a squeeze on independent insurance agencies. Although 90 percent of all small businesses and homeowners choose to write their health, life, property and casualty insurance through independent agents, big insurers have cut their commissions to these agents in half. If the strategy is to eliminate the independents, it is working: since 1987, the ranks of these agencies have been reduced by 37 percent.</p>
        <p>In an economy putting this kind of pressure on independent small-business people, the old political paradigms -- capital versus labor, free enterprise versus big government -- are less relevant than a new one: big capital versus small capital. Consumers tempted to think the consolidation of power in the hands of big companies may streamline costs and lower prices should ask themselves how well airline deregulation worked in practice.</p>
        <p>Corporations' seeking to maximize profits is nothing new. What is new is the degree to which big business is cannibalizing its own small partners and displacing arrangements in retailing, health care and insurance that give customers someone in their community to connect with directly.</p>
        <p>This new fault line in the American economy has the capacity to put traditional political allegiances up for grabs. Small-business owners are looking for political help when franchise laws are attacked and commission payments are gutted. Doctors, patients and independent insurance agents are looking for help when the insurance companies are calling the shots.</p>
        <p>In this new, fundamentally different fight between competing capitalists, it would be difficult for the Republican ticket to champion the small-business banner, given George W. Bush's and Dick Cheney's personal and political ties to corporate America. The Democrats, therefore, have the opening they need to lay claim once again to being champion of the little guy.</p>
        <p>Al Gore's populist rhetoric and Joseph Lieberman's service on the Senate Small Business Committee may help them articulate just what is at stake in this new cleavage in American politics (although Mr. Lieberman's longtime links to Connecticut's big insurance companies could pose a problem). But can they ally the Democratic Party in two months with the 13 million small-business voters who have been hammered for two decades with the message that Democrats are their enemies?</p>
        <p>Once the Democratic Party was the undeniable defender of the little guy, the worker, in the face of corporate oppression. Then the Republicans usurped that role, among small-business owners at least, by defending small business against the excesses of big government. Now, if the Democrats can convince small business that their party stands with them in their biggest battle, they have a real opportunity to win this presidential election and regain a majority in Congress as well.</p>
