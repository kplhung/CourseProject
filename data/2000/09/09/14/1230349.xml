        <p>There is no doubt that there are many ways common and mysterious to use a book, from reading to doorstop. But this summer a woman of my acquaintance suggested one I had not thought of, although after  some inquiries I discovered it was not an uncommon convention or trick, albeit a dangerous one. It is the book as litmus test, used mostly but not always in measuring a lurking romance.</p>
        <p>''I had a boyfriend who wasn't an ideal choice and a potential boyfriend who also wasn't an ideal choice,'' the woman explained. Her litmus test had a rather charming absurdity about it. She gave each man John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning risible masterpiece, ''A Confederacy of Dunces'' (L.S.U., 1980), and that, in fact, is what the two turned out to be. ''I wanted to see if they cared enough about me to at least read a book I liked. I gave one of them the novel a second time. Neither read it.'' She dumped them both.</p>

        <p>There is no doubt that there are many ways common and mysterious to use a book, from reading to doorstop. But this summer a woman of my acquaintance suggested one I had not thought of, although after  some inquiries I discovered it was not an uncommon convention or trick, albeit a dangerous one. It is the book as litmus test, used mostly but not always in measuring a lurking romance.</p>
        <p>''I had a boyfriend who wasn't an ideal choice and a potential boyfriend who also wasn't an ideal choice,'' the woman explained. Her litmus test had a rather charming absurdity about it. She gave each man John Kennedy Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning risible masterpiece, ''A Confederacy of Dunces'' (L.S.U., 1980), and that, in fact, is what the two turned out to be. ''I wanted to see if they cared enough about me to at least read a book I liked. I gave one of them the novel a second time. Neither read it.'' She dumped them both.</p>
        <p>This revelation led to an informal survey in which, for women at least, two of the most popular test books were Tolstoy's tragedy of a woman's faith in romantic love, ''Anna Karenina,'' and ''The Sun Also Rises,'' Hemingway's so-called ''lost generation'' novel of drinking, fighting, wandering and love-making among expatriates in postwar Paris.</p>
        <p>For a woman who elected ''The Sun Also Rises,'' the novel was not as absolute a measure as ''Confederacy'' but rather part of a battery of tests. She described it this way: ''If they failed, I didn't automatically dump them; I monitored them more carefully about their sensibility. I liked the style and sensibility of the novel's characters, particularly Lady Brett, and I wanted to see if the guy could relate to a strong female like her. I even went to Spain to give a guy a copy of the book. It was a bizarre little dating test, and I ended up married to a guy who still hasn't read the book.''</p>
        <p>Several women used ''Anna Karenina.'' Melissa Bank, the best-selling author, said that a friend of hers was involved with a man who identified with Anna Karenina's husband, Alexei Karenin, ''a man of remarkably weak character who was bound by convention and not the least passionate.'' One doesn't need to write fiction to know how that relationship fared. Ms. Bank added: ''Once on a date, I was talking to this guy about Anna Karenina and he missed the point of Anna driving to the train station. This didn't bode well. I know you are totally separated from someone when they don't get a book, or they love a book you thought was terrible.'' Pretty unforgiving testing grounds.</p>
        <p>Nan A. Talese, editorial director of her eponymous Doubleday imprint, said: ''I've never directly used a book as such a test, but I am very, very aware of what someone says about a book because it says a great deal about themselves. You get a tremendous insight into the character of people and their emotions from the books they like.''</p>
        <p>So the book is pretty much established as an important psychic tool, at least inferentially. One woman recalled that anyone she had dated ''had to like Dickens because the importance of marrying art to social justice was important to me, and if he didn't get that he didn't get me. I gave 'The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual' '' by Harold Cruse (William Morrow &amp; Company , 1967) ''to a guy who didn't get it, and I said, 'I'm not sure about you, buddy.' '' She added, ''One guy never read novels, and I said to myself, 'Oh, my God, if I marry this guy our kids will lack the genes for fiction.' ''</p>
        <p>And one woman, before marrying her second husband, gave him a reading list of a novel each of Proust, Joyce and Henry James. ''If he had not gotten through them, or said they were too boring, I wouldn't have married him,'' she said. Actually, she read the Joyce to him ''and presumably he also read it himself.'' But she admits she doesn't know that.</p>
        <p>There are variations on the book as litmus test. A female book editor said that ''anyone who liked 'The Bridges of Madison County,' '' Robert James Waller's 1992 wet-hanky read from Warner Books, was off her list because of ''its terrible sentimental dribble.'' But it must be admitted that there are others who for the very same reason find it a must, and they made it a best seller.</p>
        <p>Another woman said that she was given a test book, Kenneth Grahame's ''Wind in the Willows,'' to see ''if I would respond to its magical quality. He gained points with his choice of the test but lost points when he impregnated someone else.''</p>
        <p>Still, if it seems that using books as a relationship test is mostly a woman thing, one male publishing executive recalled that in his youth, ''Holden Caulfield spoke for me on some kind of level and in making a new friend, male or female, I always managed to find out early if they liked 'Catcher.' If they didn't I felt a little cooler toward them.'' He said that he read ''Catcher in the Rye'' annually ''as an exercise'' until his mid-20's, when J. D. Salinger's book stopped working for him at that intimate level; he said that no book had replaced it.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the litmus test is not a particular book but an author. Jerry Howard, editorial director of Broadway Books, a Random House Inc. imprint, said: ''If a person I am talking to turns out to be a Don DeLillo fan, there's a good chance we are going to get along because it indicates a quality of mind and a certain appreciation of cosmic ironies. I love this guy's writing so much I look for fellow admirers.'' Mr. Howard edited Mr. DeLillo's ''Libra'' when it was published by Viking in 1988.</p>
        <p>Of course, for many the most basic test is simply whether the other person ever picks up a book. Usually ''it's a woman asking if she can be serious about a man who doesn't read at all,'' said John Sterling, publisher of Henry Holt. ''It's not just what's your favorite book. If he says 'I haven't read one since . . .' it isn't going to help him.''</p>
        <p>Plato said that books ''seem to be alive, but do not answer a word to the questions they are asked.'' Clearly he was wrong. They apparently answer a lot of questions about relationships.</p>
