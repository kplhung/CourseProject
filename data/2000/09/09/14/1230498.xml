        <p>AS the growing number of people on the roads in the Los Angeles area clogs traffic, often to glacial speeds, a form of transportation that is invisible to most members of the middle class in that car-oriented megalopolis is helping people travel faster: the bus.</p>
        <p>Thanks to new technology plus common sense, 70,000 commuters a day can now often outpace the drivers on nearby clogged freeways by traveling on two routes served by red Metro Rapid buses, powered by natural gas. Los Angeles County transportation officials have managed to shave as much as 25 percent off the travel time of a local bus trip by adopting technology that, among things, can keep green lights on just a little longer as the bus approaches -- as long as doing that does not cause another set of traffic problems.</p>
        <p>The regional authority decided to take action because a survey showed that speed was the biggest complaint of bus passengers. In just a few years, average bus speeds had declined 17 percent, to just 10 miles per hour from a torrid 12.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority learned through its surveys that buses spent half their time standing still, either at red lights or at bus stops, waiting for passengers to get on and off. Officials had tried to speed things up a decade earlier by equipping buses with special transmitters that would hold traffic lights on green until buses passed through. But that just backed up the traffic on cross-streets, so the initiative was abandoned.</p>
        <p>In 1997, traffic officials heard about a similar effort in Curitaba, Brazil, that was successful because the system was smarter in several ways. For one thing, it held the lights for buses only when that did not cause other traffic snarls.</p>
        <p>Still, there was no guarantee that the system would work in Los Angeles. Curitaba was built to handle public transportation, while public transit in Los Angeles often appears to be an afterthought. Even though one million people ride buses each day in the county, the bus is the transportation mode of last resort for most Angelenos.</p>
        <p>The regional transit authority decided to adopt many of Curitaba's strategies. ''Our goal was to decrease travel time over our existing limited-stop express service by 25 percent,'' said Rex Gephart, who manages the Metro Rapid project. ''If we couldn't do that, we'd abandon the project.''</p>
        <p>On June 24, the transit authority began a system that gives express special buses priority at traffic signals. It first had to embed 210 antenna loops in the pavement at various spots along the route. As a bus passes over one of the loops, a $75 transmitter mounted on its front sends an identifying signal to an equipment box that controls the traffic light at the next intersection. The signal is also sent to a central control center downtown, so the bus can be tracked in the computer system.</p>
        <p>But the $10 million project needed to find a way to ease the way for buses to clear intersections without tying up traffic on cross-streets. So the Los Angeles Department of Transportation wrote software that lets a green light be extended -- held on green longer or switched to green earlier -- for no more than 10 seconds. If several buses approach an intersection as the light is about the change, they can still get only 10 more seconds of green. Buses arriving later than that have to wait. And at important intersections, the green light can be extended in only every other cycle.</p>
        <p>To prevent bus drivers from speeding up to make the system extend green lights, there are no visual indicators in the buses to tell drivers when some extra speed would accomplish that.</p>
        <p>To shed additional seconds off travel time, the two bus routes were simplified and stops were limited to no closer together than every eight-tenths of a mile; that limit is two-tenths of a mile for local service.</p>
        <p>The buses stop on the far corners of intersections, after traffic lights. Local stops are still on the near corner, so the stops are less crowded, making it easier to board and unload passengers.</p>
        <p>Only the authority's new NABI buses, built in Hungary, are used for Metro Rapid routes. They are low to the ground and have fewer steps, which makes boarding easier and faster.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority also watched how people left the buses. As expected, just as many passengers exited through the front doors as through the back doors, and that delayed the passengers boarding through the front doors. Project officials decided to paint large exit signs on the back doors, and they will eventually have drivers ask passengers to leave through the rear.</p>
        <p>The movement of each express bus is tracked in the authority's bus control center downtown, both on a computer screen (using the transmitter signals) and through information from video cameras placed at strategic intersections throughout the region.</p>
        <p>As a bus passes over a pair of electronic loops embedded in the street, its speed is calculated. Then its arrival time is transmitted via a cell phone link to an electronic display at the next bus stop.</p>
        <p>Buses are dispatched every 3 to 10 minutes. And if a Metro Rapid bus finishes its route quicker than scheduled, that's fine. That just makes for a more contented rider.</p>
        <p>To prevent Metro Rapid buses from bunching up into packs, the central dispatcher radios the driver to slow down or speed up (without breaking the speed limit) to keep from getting too close to another bus.</p>
        <p>The project has been successful so far. On the 16-mile Ventura Boulevard route, from Warner Center to Universal City, the average travel time has decreased by 25 percent, to 45 minutes from 1 hour. On the 26-mile route from Santa Monica through Beverly Hills to Montebello on the east side of the city, travel times have also dropped by 25 percent, to 1 1/2 hours from 2 hours.</p>
        <p>While the data is still being analyzed, project officials say, they believe that 30 percent to 40 percent of the improvement in travel times can be credited to the signal-timing technology. Arrival times for Metro Rapid buses are coordinated with the area's new Red Line subway extension so that even during rush hour, Mr. Gephart said, a trip across the San Fernando Valley into Union Station can now be done in about one hour, often faster than a car journey.</p>
        <p>Will the improvements brought about by this new technology be enough to persuade the middle classes, and not just people without cars, to use public transportation? ''That's what we're hoping for,'' Mr. Gephart said. The authority hopes to add 15 to 20 new express lines, he said, and transit systems around the country are calling him to find out how they can adapt the Los Angeles system to speed up their bus services.</p>
