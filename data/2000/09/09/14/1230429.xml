        <p>The biggest smirks in politics today are on the faces of participants in the rhetoric of ridicule known as ''the snickering campaign.''</p>
        <p>Ridicule focused on minor characteristics is nothing new; we taunted Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter about their regional accents, and made one of our most athletic and physically coordinated presidents, Gerald Ford, into an incredible klutz. Until recently Al Gore was the butt of jokes about his wooden demeanor and forlorn use of earth tones to achieve alpha-masculinity.</p>
        <p>Now a withering fusillade of  sneers is being fired at the campaign of George W. Bush. It began with a question that few could answer about the names of foreign potentates; his embarrassment at thus being mousetrapped incurred the hooting of pundits who keep those names on crib sheets.</p>
        <p>He stumbles over words unfamiliar to him: in the manipulated hoo-hah about the flash of the last four letters of ''bureaucrats'' on a TV spot, Bush's rejection of ''subliminal'' ads came out ''subliminable.'' This brought catcalls from commentators who would praise their own dogged efforts as indefatigable if they could pronounce it.</p>
        <p>Manipulated hoo-hah? The ''rats'' frame, which lasted a thirtieth of a second, was first noted publicly with amusement by Tony Snow, a former speechwriter for President Bush, on a Fox TV program on Aug. 28. Nobody noticed (proof again that if an event is not reported in The New York Times, it hasn't happened).</p>
        <p>But Snickery Central in Nashville noticed, and the Gore campaign held the precious information for two weeks to be recycled for maximum effect after Labor Day. It was then passed to The Times, which dutifully noted the Gore source and gave the story front-page treatment, which led to this week's media frenzy.</p>
        <p>Gore, primed well in advance, expressed profound ''disappointment'' at this Orwellian mass hypnosis. Joe Lieberman bowed his head, presumably in prayer for the Republic in its moment of peril.</p>
        <p>Why did this hyped hysteria drive the reading on the Snickery Scale toward 10, its highest level? Because the TV spotmaker's miscue gained resonance from a previous snicker-generator: the locker-room derogation of a colleague of mine by Bush, unaware of a nearby live microphone. (People forgive politicians for using such language in private about journalists; more damaging was Thomas Dewey's ''idiot engineer.'')</p>
        <p>Snickery Central made the most of it. For days after Bush's foolish scatological reference (thankfully not a career-ending ethnic slur), Gore spokesmen slyly repeated the phrase's compound adjectival component, ''major-league,'' which succeeded in causing mild after-snickers. Listen for Gore in debate using ''major-league'' rather than ''world-class.''</p>
        <p>Thus has the room of politics been filled with gaffe gas, awaiting a blooper's spark to ignite an explosion of derision that echoes endlessly through the media. Bush even endured a pop from the mythical DAM (Mothers Against Dyslexia).</p>
        <p>Democratic partisans equate  Bush's occasional verbal stumbles with Gore's too-careful verbal legalisms, like ''community outreach'' to conceal illegal fund-raising, and his Clintonesque obfuscations like ''no controlling legal authority.'' That ignores motive: Better an honest bumble or dopey crack than a practiced evasion.</p>
        <p>But the snickermongers now encouraging the bashing of Bush have to worry about another swing of the pendulum. A need for the appearance of fair play may soon induce some current Bush-bashers to turn elitist smirks on Gore or even Hillary.</p>
        <p>At that point, we can hope that the symbiotic spinmeister-media snickering campaign, demeaning to voters and candidates, will be condemned as ''negative.'' Then the silly sniping will give way to the worthier business of assessing Bush's grasp of foreign affairs and the teachers' and trial lawyers' grasp of Gore.</p>
        <p>The rhetoric of ridicule has its traditional place; don't knock the mock. But September has seen the shadowboxing on debates (Bush's fault), the primacy of piety (Gore's fault), the play of contradictory poll guesswork as news (the media's fault), sustained inattention (the public's fault), and the failure to sneer snappily at the snickering campaign (my fault). Eight weeks to a fateful decision; let's all shape up.</p>
