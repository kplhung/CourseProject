        <p>The World Championships, which ended on Saturday in Maastricht, the Netherlands, were highly successful from many angles.</p>
        <p>The bridge was exciting, with the major titles, the Open Teams and the Women's Teams, going to Italy and the United States. There were several secondary titles: the Senior Teams, won by the United States; the University Teams, won by Austria; and the Transnational Teams, won by the E-Bridge Team, which included four Americans, one Pole and one Israeli.</p>
        <p>The hosts lived up to their reputation as superb organizers. They provided two Vugraph theaters, one with commentary in English and the other with commentary in Dutch. Large audiences were able to follow the action in detail, with closed circuit cameras that could focus not only on the faces of the players but also on the explanatory notes that they wrote for their opponents.</p>
        <p>The first deal of the semifinal between England and Italy electrified the large Vugraph audience. It can be seen that the desirable contracts are six clubs or six no-trump played from the North side. Note that six hearts by North could be defeated by an immediate club ruff.</p>
        <p>The Italians sitting North and South were Norberto Bocchi and Giorgio Duboin, who use a highly artificial bidding method. The two-club response to one heart simply showed a strong hand and asked North to describe his hand in terms of strength, distribution and high cards. He did so in great detail in response to a series of minimum bids that were ''relays.'' Each of them, up to three diamonds, said, ''Tell me more.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for South, he could not play clubs or no-trump from the safe North side. The final contract was six clubs, which was now due to be in jeopardy after a low spade lead. But it was not likely that such a lead would be forthcoming from a player who held the ace.</p>
        <p>The English player in the West seat was Gunnar Hallberg, a Swedish expert who lives in London. He was inspired to lead the spade four, and now had an excellent chance of defeating the slam.</p>
        <p>The spectators, who could see the players on closed circuit television, now expected Duboin to plunge into deep thought before making a crucial decision. Instead he roared with laughter, shrugged his shoulders, and confidently played the spade king from dummy, making an overtrick.</p>
        <p>What had happened was that Hallberg's partner, Colin Simpson, had  become confused about the bidding. He had forgotten the artificial two-club bid, and thought that he was on lead.</p>
        <p>He produced the spade 10, for which there was no penalty. With bidding screens, his partner had not seen the card, and the card went back into his hand. But Duboin was on the same side of the screen as Simpson and now knew exactly what was happening in the spade suit.</p>
        <p>Chance dictated that the diagonal screen was in a position that put Duboin and Simpson on the same side. If the screen had been placed in the other direction, it is likely that the English would have gained 11 imps instead of losing one. In the replay the lead was the spade ace against the same contract.</p>
        <p>Simpson is a Scotland Yard detective who once shot a terrorist dead who was about to assassinate a visiting dignitary in London. On this occasion, to his great chagrin, he had failed to detect that he was not on lead.</p>
