        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican Senate nominee, will begin broadcasting this 30-second advertisement, ''Education Compare,''  statewide today. It follows his speech on education Monday night. Mrs. Clinton and the state Democratic Party began running ads last week praising Mrs. Clinton's education proposals and assailing Mr. Lazio's Congressional voting on the issue.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- A split screen shows Mr. Lazio on the left and Mrs. Clinton on the right and the word ''Compare'' over them as the announcer reads off stances that Mr. Lazio has taken and Mrs. Clinton is said to oppose. The ad switches to Mr. Lazio and his wife and two children walking on a beach and finally a black screen with the text: ''Hillary Clinton. You just can't trust her.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Compare on education. Rick Lazio wants teacher competency testing. Hillary Clinton opposes it. Lazio wants 95 percent of education money in the classroom. Clinton opposes that. Lazio supported more funding and more local control. Clinton opposes more local control. Rick Lazio sends his children to public school, yet Clinton runs ads about his education position that are just not true. Lazio. For education. Clinton? You just can't trust her.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Both candidates say they favor teacher competency testing but differ on the frequency. Mrs. Clinton has proposed testing prospective teachers on their subject of expertise as a condition of letting them teach, while Mr. Lazio supports testing them every five years to ensure their competency. Neither Mr. Lazio's education plan nor his speech suggested 95 percent of education money would be spent in the classroom; he did not provide any such figures. But he did suggest giving local schools more latitude in spending the federal money they receive. Mrs. Clinton has not emphasized local control in her education speeches. Mrs. Clinton has not run ads critical of Mr. Lazio's education record; it was the state Democratic Party, which the Lazio camp sees as one and the same. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Lazio's ad a ''joke'' in light of some of his votes to cut education spending, though Mr. Lazio has also voted for education programs.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Lazio's media strategists have managed to create an issue-oriented ad while going on the attack. Mr. Lazio adopted education as a major campaign concern only in the last week, inviting criticism from Democrats that he is motivated less by heartfelt interest than by polls suggesting it is a top concern of voters. The ad, like most of his recent ones, ends with a line that stresses another Lazio theme, Mrs. Clinton's trustworthiness. Taken together, the ad could prove effective in countering concerns about Mr. Lazio's commitment to education, but pressing the trust theme seems to be equally as important a goal.</p>
