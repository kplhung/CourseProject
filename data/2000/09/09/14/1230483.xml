      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Three people in Manhattan have been  sickened and treated at hospitals after drinking three different brands of bottled water contaminated with ammonia-like substances, the police said.</p>
        <p>All three have recovered, but Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and officials of the New York Police Department and the F.B.I. said at a Gracie Mansion news conference last night that they were investigating whether the incidents, which occurred this month and last, were the result of tampering.</p>
        <p>The first and most serious case, the police said, occurred when a woman felt a burning sensation in her throat and began bleeding from her mouth after drinking a bottle of Perrier water on Aug. 3 at a Manhattan restaurant. A police official identified the restaurant as Benihana, a Japanese steak house on West 56th Street. Last night the assistant manager at the restaurant said that after the incident, he called 911 for an ambulance.</p>
        <p>The assistant manager, Rudolf Kojoh, said that a waiter had poured the water from a bottle into a glass in front of the woman, and that he had no idea how the water had been contaminated. The restaurant, he said, is no longer selling Perrier.</p>
        <p>The police commissioner, Bernard B. Kerik, said that a test of the water from the glass showed that it contained ''some type of sodium hydroxide,'' which he characterized as a kind of ''strong cleaning agent'' or a ''lye-type agent.'' He said that the woman, who was not identified, spent several days in the hospital.</p>
        <p>A senior police official said that the second incident occurred on Aug. 27 when a 58-year-old man bought a bottle of Aquafina from the Seven Brothers Deli at 719 Ninth Avenue between West 48th and 49th Streets. After opening what he thought was a sealed bottle, the police official said, the man felt a burning sensation in his throat, flagged down a police car and was taken to Bellevue Hospital. Tests on the water, Mr. Kerik said, showed the presence of ammonia.</p>
        <p>The third incident, the senior police official said, occurred on Sept. 6 when a woman bought a bottle of Poland Spring water at the Titanic Steak and Seafood Store, a take-out restaurant at 3428 Broadway between West 139th and 140th Streets. She bought and opened what she thought was a sealed bottle, then gave it to her 18-month-old baby, who spat it out and appeared to be in pain. The baby was treated at St. Luke's Hospital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik said tests on that water also showed the presence of ammonia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik said that the woman told the police that she smelled a strong ammonia-like odor from the bottle after her child became ill.</p>
        <p>The Perrier bottle was glass; the two others were plastic.</p>
        <p>Although the police have recovered the plastic bottles, they were unable to find the Perrier bottle at Benihana the morning after the woman there became ill. Mr. Kojoh of Benihana said last night that he had saved the bottle in the restaurant's bar after the woman was taken away by ambulance, but that it was not there when he came in the next day and that it had apparently been thrown out overnight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said at the news conference that the best theory of the F.B.I. and the police was that the restaurant glass, not the bottle, was contaminated. Mr. Kerik said that it was the water in the glass that was tested by investigators.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kerik said that the police and the F.B.I. were examining the plastic bottles for lacerations or holes to see if someone might have injected them with a poisonous substance. When asked if someone might have used a hypodermic needle to inject them, Mr. Kerik replied, ''I think anything is possible.''</p>
        <p>He also said investigators were checking with the manufacturers and bottling companies to see if the water might have been contaminated before they were sold.</p>
        <p>The police said investigators did not yet know if the substance found in all three bottles was the same, or if the incidents were related.</p>
        <p>''One is a restaurant, one was in a deli and one in a take-out restaurant,'' said the senior police official. ''You have three different types of water, three different kinds of adulterant. I find it difficult to find a pattern. But we have three incidents of people drinking bottled water and getting sick.''</p>
        <p>Officials did not say how long each of the three victims had spent in the hospital, but Mr. Giuliani said at the news conference that ''they underwent varying degrees of some real turmoil and some physical difficulties.''</p>
        <p>Although the mayor said that city residents should not be alarmed, he did warn that people should be especially careful in drinking bottled water.</p>
        <p>''Make sure that you open the bottle yourself,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''And you actually hear it, and you hear the noise and the air coming out of it.''</p>
        <p>He also said that people should open bottled water for themselves in restaurants, rather than letting waiters do it, and to always sniff first.</p>
