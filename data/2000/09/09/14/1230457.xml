      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The federal government calls this stretch of the Upper Missouri River ''a priceless remnant of primitive America.''</p>
        <p>So why has the idea of permanent protection for this remote quarter of the prairies, little changed from the days of Lewis and Clark, inspired the kind of not-in-my-backyard animosity usually attached to prisons and garbage dumps?</p>
        <p>The answer, expressed loud and clear by ranchers here, says a lot about Montana -- and even more  about the resistance to a plan for  conservation of public lands, in which President Clinton, in his final months in office, is trying to rival President Theodore Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has already set aside more land as national monuments in the lower 48 states than any previous president. But as the administration eyes fresh targets, including the rugged lands that surround the Upper Missouri, it is running into stiff opposition from people who regard monuments not as a legacy, but as an imposition.</p>
        <p>''How much land is enough?'' asked State Representative John E. Witt adding his voice to the anger expressed at a hastily organized meeting at the Winifred school. ''America has 500 million acres of public land already. It's a little like, 'Are we a state, or are we the District of Washington?' ''</p>
        <p>The list of new or expanded monuments by President Clinton stands at 11, and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has signaled that the designation process is not over.</p>
        <p>At issue here is a 149-mile stretch of the Missouri and rugged lands that plunge steeply to the water, known as the Missouri Breaks. The area is among eight proposed monuments that administration officials say could be designated before Mr. Clinton leaves office.</p>
        <p>The prospect has won applause from environmental groups. But in Western states like Montana, where many residents regard monument status as a potential barrier to the land on which they depend, feelings against the plans are running so high that administration officials say Mr. Clinton is likely to postpone most if not all announcements until after Election Day, to avoid hurting the chances of Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>''The truth of the matter is that Secretary Babbitt and President Clinton want to lock up as many environmentally sensitive areas as they can before they shut the lights off,'' an aide to a Western Democratic lawmaker said. ''And what they're running up against is that in the rural West, these folks are clinging to a way of life that they would lose through these monument designations.''</p>
        <p>In Montana, where polls show the public to be split on the issue, a glimpse of the debate can be seen in what might be called a battle of slogans.</p>
        <p>With his 1996 book ''Undaunted Courage,'' the historian and author Stephen Ambrose helped to draw attention to the Upper Missouri, virtually the only stretch of the more-than-2,000-mile-long river that has remained largely undeveloped in the nearly 200 years since Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and their Corps of Discovery used the Missouri as their main water route.</p>
        <p>''This is the least inhabited, most precious part of the Lower 48,'' Mr. Ambrose has said in advocating national monument status. ''It's ours to preserve for our progeny. It would be sacrilegious not to.''</p>
        <p>A very different view has been expressed by the Montana Stockgrowers' Association, a group of cattlemen who say that ranchers are perfectly capable of preserving the area themselves, as they have since homesteaders first settled the land. The organization calls its group Undaunted Stewards.</p>
        <p>''Think of the river as a sidewalk that runs in front of your house,'' said one member, Matt Knox, whose 28,000-acre ranch northeast of Winifred would be in the monument.</p>
        <p>Most of the Montana land proposed for monument status, 400,000 acres in the current draft, is already in public hands, controlled by the Bureau of Land Management. A small part is privately held, and while those owners would be permitted to remain, many fear that the government's intention is to buy  them out. And though Mr. Babbitt has assured local residents that grazing and hunting would be allowed to continue, many worry that they will find themselves enmeshed in federal regulations.</p>
        <p>At the national level, among the many Republicans who have denounced what they call a land grab is the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, a native of Wyoming who has accused the administration of misusing its authority and acting ''willy-nilly all over the West'' in imposing new restrictions on the use of public land.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt says in reply he has tried hard to seek consensus in communities that would be affected by any plan. In many cases, he said, the administration has agreed to compromises, often by allowing hunting and grazing even after a monument has been established.</p>
        <p>But he stopped short of saying the administration would defer to local wishes, particularly in Montana, where the proposed monument has met such strong opposition. And Mr. Babbitt insisted that the reason for the administration's haste reflected less a quest for a political legacy than a quest to save land that might one day be overrun by development.</p>
        <p>''The empty spaces are filling up all over the West,'' Mr. Babbitt said, arguing that in Mr. Clinton's presidency, the need to protect land had become ''much more urgent than it was, say, 50 years ago when almost no one was on it.''</p>
        <p>At issue in Montana and other states that would be affected by any presidential declaration are rival visions not only about the federal government but also about who knows what is best for the land.</p>
        <p>In southeast Oregon, plans for a possible Steens Mountain monument have been tangled by a county law that requires no net loss of private land. And in northwest Colorado, powerful sentiments have been kindled by a proposed 280,000-acre Vermillion National Monument on grasslands long used for grazing.</p>
        <p>Similar controversies have arisen over other proposals, including the possible expansion of Craters of the Moon National Monument in Idaho.</p>
        <p>The other areas under review by the Interior Department as national monuments include the Carrizo Plains, in west-central California; the Santa Rosa Mountains, near Palm Springs, Calif.; an expansion of the Colorado National Monument; and, in a development that has not yet been publicized, a possible offshore monument designed to protect the coral reefs of St. John's in the Virgin Islands.</p>
        <p>The authority to establish national monuments is spelled out in the Antiquities Act of 1906, which authorizes the president to designate such areas in order to protect ''objects of historic and scientific interest.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has used that mandate broadly as part of a strategy intended to sidestep opposition from a Republican-controlled Congress to any steps that would add new restrictions to development on public land. An act of Congress is required for the designation of a national park or national forest, steps that could carry somewhat more protection than monument status.</p>
        <p>As the founder of the national park system, President Theodore Roosevelt, set aside more public land as protected areas than anyone else.</p>
        <p>Since January, Mr. Clinton has set aside 10 monuments to protect, for example, areas that include a forest of giant redwoods in California and the last undammed stretch of the Columbia River in eastern Washington. A Republican-led bid to stop the effort by stripping the president of his monument-designation status failed in the Senate on a vote of 50 to 49 vote in July. A monument designation could not be undone by a new president, though it could be overturned by an act of Congress.</p>
        <p>Of all the battles, the one over the Missouri Breaks may be the most divisive. Even Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a Democrat, has so far remained neutral, in apparent deference to local sensitivities, while Senator Conrad Burns and the state's sole congressman, Rick Hill, both Republicans, have expressed adamant opposition.</p>
        <p>''I think the people who live on the land, and who have their culture on the land, usually make the best decisions for the land,'' Senator Burns said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Conservationists argue that the river and surrounding land needs  national monument status, in part to preserve habitat for species like the big-horned sheep, antelope and elk. And with the Lewis and Clark bicentennial approaching, beginning in 2003, they say it is also important that new campgrounds and visitor centers be put in place to help accommodate the expected visitors, with many floating down the slow, shallow river in canoes, beneath stunning rock formations and the dazzling White Cliffs.</p>
        <p>''We feel that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity, particularly not knowing what the next presidential administration will be like,'' said Dave Dittloff, conservation director of the Montana Wildlife Federation.</p>
        <p>As the stretch of the Missouri becomes better known, Mr. Dittloff said, ''recreational issues are going to get bad, and development issues are going to get worse and worse.''</p>
