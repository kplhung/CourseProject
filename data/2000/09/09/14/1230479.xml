        <p>Borrowing a page from the corporate handbook, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy has appointed four community school district superintendents as senior superintendents to mentor and advise their colleagues, who, with the senior superintendents, run the city's 32 school districts. A fifth superintendent is being brought out of retirement to oversee several districts as well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy is selecting what he considers to be the city's strongest and most experienced superintendents to help guide their colleagues at a time when students and teachers are facing tougher standards.</p>
        <p>''These are very senior people whose judgment I respect,'' Mr. Levy said. ''They have helped me understand the needs of other superintendents and serve as my advisors on instructional issues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy confirmed details of the plan that were given to The New York Times yesterday by officials connected to the Board of Education and to nonprofit school groups. He said that the move was part of larger changes in the jobs of superintendents and the Board of Education bureaucracy in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The changes involve giving superintendents more power over spending, hiring and instructional policy. Mr. Levy is considering allowing superintendents to buy supplies and services from their choice of vendor, instead of from the central board, as they are now required to do.</p>
        <p>Other recommendations include giving superintendents power to hire teachers and other employees directly, instead of having the central board hire them and assign them to districts.</p>
        <p>Interviews with several superintendents indicated that the super superintendents, as they are informally being called, have already begun working with their colleagues, advising them on matters of curriculum and helping them to draft spending plans.</p>
        <p>Ever since the system was decentralized in 1970, the 32 district superintendents have been seen as a weak link in the chain of command over elementary and middle schools. (The high schools are run directly by the Board of Education.) Under a revision of the decentralization law in 1997, the schools chancellor then, Rudy Crew, appointed borough deputies as his liaisons with the 32 superintendents. But Mr. Levy felt that they were not necessarily familiar with the running of districts and fired them in August, he said.</p>
        <p>He came up with this new system. Joseph Kovaly, who retired in June from District 11 in the Bronx, will supervise Manhattan. Betty Rosa, of District 8 in the Bronx, will oversee the Bronx, and Claire McIntee, of Community District 26, will supervise Queens, Board of Education aides said. Brooklyn will be shared by Lester Young of District 13 and Vinnie Grippo of District 20, who will also oversee Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Michael Johnson, the superintendent of District 29 in Queens, said that he had met with Ms. McIntee, who helped him develop a back-to-school plan, including helping him schedule visits to schools and making sure he had ordered enough classroom furniture.</p>
        <p>''The critical thing here is that they are actually superintendents, facing the same issues and concerns that you are facing,'' said Michael Johnson, superintendent of District 29 in Queens. ''When you raise questions, you are actually talking to someone who is facing the same problem in a few days. I think that is very positive.''</p>
        <p>Thelma Baxter, superintendent of District 5 in Manhattan, called Mr. Kovaly a knowledgeable person whose experience and advice would help improve her district.</p>
        <p>Arthur Greenberg, a longtime superintendent of District 25 in Queens who recently retired from the Board of Education, said that the job of senior superintendent could be helpful if handled properly. Mr. Greenberg teaches graduate courses at New York University's educational administration department.</p>
        <p>''If it is handled incorrectly, it could be confusing and harmful,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''The life of a superintendent is complicated enough. They report both to a school board and the chancellor.''</p>
        <p>Superintendents used to answer to school boards. But after years of the boards' being accused of corruption and political favoritism, the State Legislature stripped the boards of most of their power and turned it over to the chancellor and district superintendents.</p>
        <p>The law also created five positions for borough deputies to the chancellor. Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the State Assembly's Education Committee, said that Mr. Crew never took full advantage of the appointments, hiring more bureaucrats who created another layer. Mr. Sanders said he was unaware of Mr. Levy's appointments of senior superintendents, or if they were meant to replace the borough deputies.</p>
        <p>''He didn't fill these positions in a way that was intended by the law,'' Mr. Sanders said, referring to Mr. Crew. ''The school boards and superintendents never felt they had a go-to person if they felt they were having a difficult time getting through the bureaucracy and getting the attention of either the chancellor or the central board.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy called the borough deputies' jobs problematic. The role of the borough deputies ''has never been adequately defined and today they are neither part of central nor close to the superintendents,'' Mr. Levy complained in his letter to the board members in July.</p>
