        <p>The Inktomi Corporation, which specializes in Internet infrastructure, said today that it had agreed to acquire FastForward Networks Inc. in a stock swap valued at about $1.3 billion. FastForward, based in San Francisco, has developed software technology for the distribution and management of live broadcasting over the Internet.</p>
        <p>Shares of Inktomi, which is based in Forest City, Calif., fell $2.25, to $108.75.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the acquisition was a logical one, which fit Inktomi's strategy of expanding the capabilities of its network services business.</p>
        <p>Inktomi's network service products are aimed at improving Web performance through the more efficient distribution of content, and are typically bought by large Internet service providers like Digital Island and Exodus Communications. Some major Web sites also use Inktomi's network services to improve speed and reliability.</p>
        <p>The core product of Inktomi's network services business is Traffic Server, a software application that runs on servers deployed around the Internet, monitoring network traffic and storing frequently requested objects closer to the user. Traffic Server is a Web cache, performing a similar function to the bit of onboard memory added to microprocessors.</p>
        <p>Drew Brosseau, an analyst with SG Cowen, said the deal was similar to Inktomi's acquisition last year of Webspective, a company with a technology for managing the delivery of content over networks. Adding this capability to Traffic Server, ''added the intelligence to put the content into the caches in an intelligent way and keep it up to date,'' he said. FastForward ''does the same thing along a different direction, expanding the kinds of media they're able to support.''</p>
        <p>Internet infrastructure companies like Inktomi have to broaden their offerings to match the demand for rich media delivered over the Web. As users come to expect graphics, animation, audio and video, the need for higher performance increases exponentially.</p>
        <p>''We think that live broadcast and live streaming are going to be a real factor on the Internet, and it's going to be very soon,'' David Peterschmidt, Inktomi's president and chief executive, said in a telephone interview. ''These guys are just a real jump ahead of anything on the market today.''</p>
        <p>Inktomi made a minority investment in FastForward last year, along with America Online and Sun Microsystems. ''The more we talked with them, the more I felt that this was a company that reminded me of Inktomi two years ago,'' Mr. Peterschmidt said. ''It's deep in scientists and engineers.''</p>
        <p>FastForward's technology has already been deployed by Digital Island and Real Networks Inc., and Mr. Peterschmidt said the acquisition would add $30 million to $40 million to Inktomi's revenues in fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>FastForward Networks will operate under the Inktomi name as the media division led by Abhay Parekh, FastForward's co-founder, president and chief executive, as general manager. All employees of FastForward Networks will join Inktomi.</p>
        <p>TECHNOLOGY  Correction:  September 15, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the Inktomi Corporation's deal to acquire FastForward Networks misstated Inktomi's base. It is Foster City, Calif., not Forest City.</p>
