        <p>On Wall Street, the Chase Manhattan Corporation has long been considered an investment banking also-ran. No matter how much stock trading or underwriting Chase did, its competitors continued to disparage it as a declasse commercial bank.</p>
        <p>Now, with its proposed purchase of J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, Chase hopes that it will finally break into the club of financial firms with enduring global power. But whether Chase, the product of a series of mergers of consumer banks, will join that elite club remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>In announcing yesterday that it plans to acquire J. P. Morgan for $30.9 billion in stock, Chase executives argued that the combination of Chase's broad base of customers with Morgan's exclusive clientele and financial expertise would prevent the two banks from being left behind in the race to determine which firms will dominate corporate finance.</p>
        <p>''There will be less than a handful of end-game winners,'' said William B. Harrison Jr., chairman and chief executive of Chase. ''We will be an end-game winner.''</p>
        <p>For now at least, the combined J. P. Morgan Chase &amp; Company clearly would have the size to claim a spot among the world's financial titans. It would have about $660 billion in assets, more than 90,000 employees around the world and a stock market value of about $95 billion.</p>
        <p>But it still will be smaller than two other American financial conglomerates, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company, and it still will have to prove that it can compete with them and several other firms for the most lucrative roles of underwriting stocks and advising on mergers and acquisitions. If anything, the proposed deal will intensify the pressure on some of the biggest investment banks, like the Goldman Sachs Group and Merrill Lynch, to get even bigger soon.</p>
        <p>Each of those firms has spent many millions of dollars building itself from a specialized domestic firm into an international company with a diverse set of financial products and services to offer corporations and, in some cases, individual investors. By pushing its way into that set, Chase would be moving even further away from consumer banking. While it retains a network of more than 500 bank branches in the New York area and in Texas, Chase would derive only about 27 percent of its revenue and 19 percent of its pretax earnings from consumer services, including credit cards and home and auto loans.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Harrison said Chase had no plans to divest itself of any major lines of business, he displayed no sentimental attachment to the consumer bank operations. ''Today, we're happy with all of our consumer businesses,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he added that Chase would consider exiting any business that failed to meet management's expectations. Some analysts say they believe that one of Chase's first moves will be to stop making car loans.</p>
        <p>Shares of Chase fell $1.31, to $51.19 yesterday, after the companies confirmed reports of the deal. Analysts said that investors were concerned about how much the acquisition would dilute Chase's earnings.</p>
        <p>Ronald Mandle, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, said Chase is expected to report earnings about 5 percent lower than what had been expected before the deal was announced. In addition, he said, investors have some doubts about whether and when Chase can achieve the revenue gains it is promising from the combination.</p>
        <p>Chase is offering to issue 3.7 new shares of stock for each share of Morgan stock. Based on the $52.50 closing price for Chase shares on Tuesday Morgan's 159 million shares would be worth $30.9 billion. But Chase said that it would be acquiring 186 million shares of Morgan stock, counting all of the options and restricted shares Morgan employees own. That discrepancy and the changing price of Chase's stock led to disparities in estimates of the value of the deal.</p>
        <p>To reduce the impact of the deal on Chase's earnings, Marc J. Shapiro, a Chase vice chairman, said the banks expected to reduce their combined expenses by about $1.5 billion annually. About one-third of those cost reductions are likely to come from eliminating jobs, Mr. Harrison said, though he declined to say how many jobs.</p>
        <p>Analysts estimated that the number of jobs would be reduced by several hundred to a few thousand, a small percentage of total employment at the banks. The real challenge facing the new management team will not be in eliminating jobs but in retaining enough of Morgan's investment bankers to justify the high price Chase is paying.</p>
        <p>Chase executives may see themselves as equals to their counterparts at Wall Street's biggest firms, but investment bankers still see a gulf between themselves and most Chase employees. With most investment banks competing fiercely for young financiers, especially those with an understanding of technology, Morgan employees may choose to defect to another bona-fide member of what is known on Wall Street as the top tier. Debates rage about who belongs in that small group of leading investment banks, but it undisputably includes Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup.</p>
        <p>''The risk is that they have to smoothly blend the cultures and keep the key people,'' Mr. Mandle of Sanford C. Bernstein said.</p>
        <p>One Chase executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he hoped that acquiring Morgan would help Chase stem the number of talented employees leaving for Goldman, Sachs and other investment banks. He also said that Chase might fill holes by hiring people from Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, an investment bank that is being acquired by Credit Suisse Group.</p>
        <p>Chase executives said they had set aside a pool of stock to be used to retain the Morgan employees they most wanted to keep, but they repeatedly declined to say how big the pool was or how many people might share in it. They did not disclose the financial packages offered to any of Morgan's senior executives. Instead, they emphasized that they had tried to head off typical premerger friction by quickly deciding who would fill the 40 or 50 jobs they considered most important.</p>
        <p>The list of top managers chosen includes several executives from J. P. Morgan. Douglas A. Warner, Morgan's chairman and chief executive, would be chairman of the merged company, and two investment bankers from Morgan, Clayton Rose and Walter Gubert, will have senior management positions in the investment banking operation, to be known as J. P. Morgan.</p>
        <p>Several analysts and observers have depicted Mr. Warner as the unfortunate chairman who was left with no choice but to sell Morgan, one of the best-known names in finance, ending its 150-year run as an independent bank. But in an interview, Mr. Warner waved off that view with a stern, ''No way.''</p>
        <p>He said Morgan could have continued to go its own way quite profitably and he did not feel pressured to merge. ''There was no event'' that pushed Morgan into negotiations, until Mr. Harrison called three weeks ago and ''offered us a powerfully better option,'' Mr. Warner said.</p>
        <p>''It's not the end'' of J. P. Morgan, he said.</p>
        <p>But it would be the end of Morgan's tenure as a company focused almost solely on managing the finances of blue-chip corporations and some of the wealthiest individuals in America and Europe. Likewise for Chase, the deal would spell the end of any impression that it has its competitive sights set on anybody other than the biggest investment banks.</p>
        <p>The deal may well create even tougher competition for the top-tier investment banks, but it will have little or no effect on other commercial banks, analysts said.</p>
        <p>That is because of the demise of what was once known as the money center bank -- the biggest banks in the biggest cities that took deposits from individuals and lent them to big companies. Most of those banks have combined into sprawling regional banking companies, like BankOne, First Union and Wells Fargo, that find more fertile opportunities serving consumers and small businesses than trying to finance a multinational company.</p>
        <p>''The Fortune 1000 doesn't borrow from banks any more, and that's why money center banking isn't around,'' said Lori B. Appelbaum, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Most of the bigger regional banks have bought brokerage firms, but generally these have been smaller firms that serve their existing clients rather than those that aim to butt heads with Goldman, Sachs.</p>
        <p>''What is happening here is you have to make a choice,'' said Susan Roth, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ''Are you going to be a niche player or are you going to be full service and global because there is nothing in between. No one can be half-global.''</p>
        <p>There are only three banks in the United States left that combine local and global businesses -- Chase, Citigroup and perhaps Bank of America.</p>
        <p>Analysts say that at Chase, the consumer and small-business lines will continue to be a smaller and smaller portion of the company. While there is no compelling reason for the two aspects of Chase to be together, there is no pressure to split them apart, they said.</p>
        <p>''Chase's mass-market business is growing slower than the rest of the company, but it has nice returns on equity,'' Ms. Roth said. ''There is no reason for them to get rid of it.''</p>
        <p>At Citigroup, perhaps one of the few things that its main components -- the Travelers Group and Citicorp -- had in common was that they were committed to building both consumer and corporate business, and that continues in the combined institution. That said, much of Citigroup's biggest wholesale opportunities are with midsize companies in the 100 countries in which it does business rather than with the world leaders that the new J. P. Morgan Chase is going after.</p>
        <p>Bank of America is one bank that has a choice yet to make about whether it will compete in the big leagues of investment banking. It has longstanding lending relationships with big companies and a growing regional brokerage business. But it has been consumed by the slow and difficult work of stitching together the myriad banks it has acquired from Miami to Seattle. And its stock price has lagged as investors grew impatient, making any acquisitions now very difficult.</p>
        <p>This puts the company in a difficult situation, analysts said, that may lead the bank to forgo investment banking.</p>
        <p>''Let's face it,'' Ms. Appelbaum said. ''The lesson of J. P. Morgan is it doesn't pay to build it yourself.''</p>
