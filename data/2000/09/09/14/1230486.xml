        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Choosing a Salary or Tuition'' (Sept. 7), about high school graduates who are going straight into technology jobs: It occurred to me that our nation and the media perpetuate two popular myths: the gifted young athlete and the genius teenage programmer.</p>
        <p>We have paraded before us the tall, handsome basketball player or the geeky child-at-computer, both primed for stardom and millions of  dollars. Then they disappear.</p>
        <p>Why? Because when our strapping lad, for example, goes up against seasoned veterans, he ends up spending most of his time peeling himself off the floor. His grizzled competitors may or may not shoot as well as he does, but they are strong, experienced, efficient, tough and ruthless. Taken out of his limited environment and thrust into real life, the playground wizard rarely even survives, let alone stars.</p>
        <p>The young talented teenagers profiled in your article clearly have a few skills, but they need to realize their limitations and go back to school before reality rears its ugly head. (Q.: What do you call a dot-com whiz kid with big stock options? A.: Waiter!)</p>
