        <p>Donald Whyte, a violinist in the New York Philharmonic, died on Sunday at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was 68 and lived in Pleasantville, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The cause was complications after surgery, said Eric Latzky, a spokesman for the Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whyte was born in Rivers, Manitoba, in 1942, and began his violin studies with his father, Alexander Whyte. He continued his studies at the University of Saskatchewan and later as a student of Josef Gingold at Indiana University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whyte was a member of the Cincinnati Symphony, the Montreal Symphony and the Pittsburgh Symphony before joining the New York Philharmonic in 1972. As a member of the orchestra, he was a representative at the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, an organization that monitors everything from compensation to performance conditions at the major orchestras. He was also a board member of the Music Assistance Fund, which provides support for young minority musicians.</p>
        <p>In addition to his work with the Philharmonic, Mr. Whyte played recitals with his wife, Noriko Kitamura, a pianist, and played chamber music with several ensembles.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife and a daughter, Lianne McKenzie of Calgary, Alberta.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 15, 2000, Friday  An obituary yesterday about Donald Whyte, a violinist in the New York Philharmonic, misstated his age. He was 58, not 68.</p>
