        <p>Executives of The Los Angeles Times said yesterday that they were closing 14 money-losing ''Our Times'' local newspapers, laying off 125 employees and abandoning the strategy of winning new readers and advertisers with hyperlocal coverage of traffic, schools and community groups.</p>
        <p>The move by the paper's publisher, John Puerner, and its editor, John S. Carroll, represents the sharpest break from the past since the Tribune Company announced in March that it was buying the Times Mirror Company, the newspaper's parent.

        <p>Executives of The Los Angeles Times said yesterday that they were closing 14 money-losing ''Our Times'' local newspapers, laying off 125 employees and abandoning the strategy of winning new readers and advertisers with hyperlocal coverage of traffic, schools and community groups.</p>
        <p>The move by the paper's publisher, John Puerner, and its editor, John S. Carroll, represents the sharpest break from the past since the Tribune Company announced in March that it was buying the Times Mirror Company, the newspaper's parent. Still, it continued a pattern set almost immediately, when Tribune executives revised The Times's March circulation figures downward, indicating that the original numbers were overstated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carroll said that the decision largely to scrap the ''Our Times'' strategy was ''difficult in terms of the human consequences, and also difficult in terms of community relations, but journalistically and financially it was an easy decision.'' Mr. Puerner said that ''all of them were losing money, and the financial performance was deterioriating.''</p>
        <p>While most of the publications, which were run under a separate division called Times Community Newspapers, will close, the section that served the inland area around Ontario, in western San Bernardino County, will continue, as will three other local weekly supplements. The local newspaper in Ontario is owned by the MediaNews Group, whose chief executive, Dean Singleton, owns several newspapers that compete with The Times.</p>
        <p>Also surviving are some Times-owned local newspapers that served areas like Newport Beach, Glendale and Huntington Beach and Burbank before being absorbed into Times Community Newspapers.</p>
        <p>The decision undoes one of the last strategic initiatives begun by Mark H. Willes, the former chief executive of Times Mirror, and Kathryn Downing, who succeeded Mr. Willes as publisher of The Times. Robert G. Magnuson, the executive who had been in charge of the ''Our Times'' effort, left the newspaper not long after it was bought by the Tribune Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carroll said in an interview that part of the savings would be reinvested in news coverage. He added that the closing of the local newspapers -- some of which had been published as stand-alone papers and some of which were distributed as sections within The Times -- was a  step in rethinking local coverage.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say anything that suggests we're not as committed as we've ever been to national and foreign news,'' he said, ''but I do think there's more work that needs to be done in figuring out how you cover this region. In some ways it's a much more complicated question.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carroll and Mr. Puerner said they would continue publication of the newspaper's three regional editions in Orange County, Ventura County and in the San Fernando Valley.</p>
