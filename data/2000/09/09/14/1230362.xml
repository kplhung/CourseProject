        <p>Document scanners that can convert a page of text into an electronic file made their debut several years ago, and they have been saving businesses time, money and treatment bills for repetitive-stress injuries since then.

        <p>Document scanners that can convert a page of text into an electronic file made their debut several years ago, and they have been saving businesses time, money and treatment bills for repetitive-stress injuries since then. But while text scanners tend to be big and bulky, Philips Electronics recently introduced a small portable camera for the PC that can scan images and text on the go, even with a laptop PC.</p>
        <p>The Vesta Pro Scan package, which includes the Vesta Pro camera and PageCam software developed by Xerox, can also handle video-conferencing chores and can record digital motion pictures at up to 30 frames per second with a maximum resolution of 640 by 480 pixels.</p>
        <p>The Vesta Pro camera has a built-in microphone and easy-focus lens and will also take still photographs at a resolution of 800 by 600 pixels.</p>
        <p>The small camera, which resembles an egg with a lens on the front, connects to the computer via the U.S.B. port. It comes with a small metal tripod to steady it for scanning text and photos. Once an item is scanned by the camera, it can be copied and pasted from the PageCam software into another program.</p>
        <p>The Vesta Pro Scan package will work with computers running Windows 98 that have 32 megabytes of RAM and a 200-MHz Pentium-level processor. The package has a suggested price of $129.99, and road warriors will be heartened to know that there's one less thing to pack -- the camera draws its power from the U.S.B. port so there's no need to carry an extra power cord.</p>
