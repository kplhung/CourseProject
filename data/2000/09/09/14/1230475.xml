        <p>When Joe Smith signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves in January 1999, he accepted a one-year contract worth only $1.75 million, a small sum for a 6-foot-10-inch forward with immense potential who had been the first pick in the 1995 draft.</p>
        <p>The deal raised a few eyebrows around the National Basketball Association. Smith, 25, should have been worth between three to five times as much on the open market, league officials say. Indeed, he had earned $2.5 million in his rookie year with the Golden State Warriors.</p>

        <p>When Joe Smith signed with the Minnesota Timberwolves in January 1999, he accepted a one-year contract worth only $1.75 million, a small sum for a 6-foot-10-inch forward with immense potential who had been the first pick in the 1995 draft.</p>
        <p>The deal raised a few eyebrows around the National Basketball Association. Smith, 25, should have been worth between three to five times as much on the open market, league officials say. Indeed, he had earned $2.5 million in his rookie year with the Golden State Warriors.</p>
        <p>The skeptics, it turns out, had reason to doubt. Smith signed two agreements with the Timberwolves: the first was the one-year contract that the team sent to the league office in New York. But the second was an extensive secret agreement in which the team's owner promised Smith, in writing, a seven-year deal worth as much as $86 million after he had worked for three years under less lucrative one-year contracts, said several people who have seen both documents.</p>
        <p>The tactics of the Timberwolves, Smith and his agent, Eric Fleisher, reflect a widespread problem in professional basketball that has undercut the effectiveness of the N.B.A.'s salary-cap rules. Those rules, league officials say, are intended to keep rich teams from hoarding the best talent.</p>
        <p>For years, there have been allegations that some agents and owners were circumventing the salary cap, using a loophole that lets a team re-sign its own free agents after three years even if the new contract exceeds the cap. Known as the Larry Bird rule, the provision was originally meant to protect owners from being forced to break up a great team just to remain under the salary cap.</p>
        <p>But some owners and agents have been exploiting the loophole, agents and officials from the league and the players union say. Teams that cannot afford an expensive player because of the salary cap sometimes sign him first to a series of low-paying, one-year contracts, while promising, with a wink and a nod, to give him a lucrative multiyear deal three years later, when he gets what are known as his ''Bird rights.''</p>
        <p>Some officials in the National Football League have also been concerned about teams doing an end run around salary-cap restrictions. The league's management council has been investigating whether Carmen Policy, the former president of the San Francisco 49ers, violated salary-cap rules in contracts in the 1990's with Steve Young, a former quarterback, and Brent Jones, a former tight end.</p>
        <p>In the past, the N.B.A. has made fruitless attempts to investigate allegations of secret deals to circumvent the salary cap. The league's lawyers have always failed to find a paper trail proving that secret agreements existed.</p>
        <p>In Smith's case, however, the league has obtained copies of the two agreements, which show that in early 1999 Smith and his agent, Fleisher, negotiated not only a standard one-year contract, which was filed with the league, but also an extensive separate pact with the Timberwolves' owner, Glen Taylor.</p>
        <p>That secret agreement was never shown to the N.B.A., league officials said. People who have read the second agreement said it laid out a 10-year arrangement under which Taylor agreed to sign Smith to three one-year contracts, of $1.75 million, $2.1 million and $3.6 million.</p>
        <p>Taylor also agreed that he would give Smith, before the 2001-2 season, two additional contracts that cumulatively over seven years would be worth between $40.6 million and $86.6 million. The final value of the deal depended on whether Smith became an All-Star or led the team to a championship, several people who have read the documents said. The secret agreement is dated Jan. 22, 1999, a day before the one-year contract for $1.75 million was signed, notarized and sent by the team to the league's offices in New York.</p>
        <p>In the one-year contract filed with the league, Fleisher signed an oath, under penalty of perjury, saying that ''there are no undisclosed agreements of any kind, express or implied, oral or written.''</p>
        <p>Yet the secret agreement, signed by Smith and Taylor the previous day, said its provisions would override any other contracts the parties had signed. ''The terms of this agreement shall control,'' the document says, people who have read it said.</p>
        <p>Fleisher did not return telephone calls left yesterday at his office.</p>
        <p>But Smith's new agent, Daniel Fegan, portrayed his client as a victim of an unscrupulous agent. He said the secret agreements were unnecessary and ''were designed to protect the interests of the player agent, not the player.'' He also said Smith had never asked Fleisher or the team to draft the documents, and that the agent had advised Smith to sign them without explaining that they violated the salary-cap rules.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe for a minute that he understood exactly what he was signing,'' Fegan said. ''And I don't believe it was ever explained to him or that he understood what he was risking.''</p>
        <p>Taylor declined a request to be interviewed for this article. In an article last weekend in The Minneapolis Star Tribune, he acknowledged the secret agreement, but stopped short of admitting that he had violated the salary-cap provisions in the collective bargaining agreement between the N.B.A. and the players association.</p>
        <p>''The agreement called for a number of things to be phased in each year,'' Taylor said. ''We agreed on different scenarios of what his market value would be.</p>
        <p>''But it basically just said that we had to conform with the collective bargaining rules; it would be an agreement that we would send into the commissioner for his approval. There were no side deals or anything like that.''</p>
        <p>N.B.A. officials do not see it that way. In a news release, league officials called the existence of a secret agreement ''the most serious salary-cap offense that can be committed by teams, players or agents.''</p>
        <p>An arbitrator, Kenneth Dam, a University of Chicago professor, has been hired to hold private hearings into the matter.</p>
        <p>''We are alleging that there is a written undisclosed agreement between Joe Smith and the Timberwolves,'' Joel Litvin, the N.B.A. executive vice president for legal and business affairs, said. ''The agreement, which is set forth in writing, calls for future payments to Smith of tens of millions of dollars and was deliberately hidden from the league by the parties involved.''</p>
        <p>The arbitrator could order several penalties against the team, including a fine of up to $3.5 million, the forfeiture of draft picks and the suspension of team officials for up to a year.</p>
        <p>Fleisher could face severe sanctions from the player's union, which certifies agents. The union's comittee on agent regulation could strip him of his license to represent N.B.A. players. As a lawyer, he also runs a risk of being sanctioned by the bar association if it is shown he committed perjury.</p>
        <p>As a player, Smith faces a less severe penalty. His pacts with the team could be voided, leaving him once more a free agent.</p>
        <p>Still, he would then have to go into a market where few teams have the room under the salary cap to pay him what he is worth, and he may be forced to play as a free agent for three more years at a reduced salary before getting his precious Larry Bird rights back, his agent said.</p>
        <p>In the N.B.A., the Larry Bird loophole has made the cap easy to override. In most cases, league officials have been powerless to stop the practice, because they have been unable to prove the existence of secret agreements.</p>
        <p>''This time we've got them dead to rights,'' one league official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p>
