        <p>When Danielle Gaydos, an executive for a film production company, went to Newark International Airport Saturday for one of her frequent trips to Los Angeles, she parked her car in Lot D and took the monorail to Terminal C. When she returned this morning at 6:30 on the red-eye, she was surprised to be greeted by red-jacketed customer service representatives who directed her instead to a shuttle bus back to the parking lot and even helped with her luggage.</p>
        <p>''For months I had been seeing these signs in the terminal about the 'monorail-bypass bus' areas, but I couldn't figure out for the life of me why you would want to bypass the monorail,'' said Ms. Gaydos, who lives in Hoboken. She confessed that she had not read closely the bright orange signs warning that the airport's four-year-old rail line would be shut down for repairs from September till at least January. ''The moment I got back here, I thought it would be a big inconvenience, but the bus was very nice and it was actually fine.''</p>

        <p>When Danielle Gaydos, an executive for a film production company, went to Newark International Airport Saturday for one of her frequent trips to Los Angeles, she parked her car in Lot D and took the monorail to Terminal C. When she returned this morning at 6:30 on the red-eye, she was surprised to be greeted by red-jacketed customer service representatives who directed her instead to a shuttle bus back to the parking lot and even helped with her luggage.</p>
        <p>''For months I had been seeing these signs in the terminal about the 'monorail-bypass bus' areas, but I couldn't figure out for the life of me why you would want to bypass the monorail,'' said Ms. Gaydos, who lives in Hoboken. She confessed that she had not read closely the bright orange signs warning that the airport's four-year-old rail line would be shut down for repairs from September till at least January. ''The moment I got back here, I thought it would be a big inconvenience, but the bus was very nice and it was actually fine.''</p>
        <p>That was the general assessment of many travelers moving about the airport today, the fourth day the monorail has been out of service. A temporary system of shuttle buses ferries passengers between terminals, car-rental lots and parking lots, where a van service takes them to and from their cars.</p>
        <p>A hardy bunch after a summer of extensive flight delays and cancellations, many of these frequent fliers were at first visibly annoyed when they were directed to a line of noisy buses rather than to what one traveler, Paul Plath, termed ''their nice new monorail.'' But in the end, he and others said they were pleasantly surprised.</p>
        <p>''It was relatively painless,'' said Mr. Plath, a Denver engineer returning from a trip to London. Polite airport representatives met him at the gate and directed him to a bus to his connecting flight at another terminal.</p>
        <p>Of course, there were skeptics who noted that it was a warm, sunny Wednesday without the hordes of travelers that are expected on holidays in the months to come. To Leo Heffernan of Boston, the bus system was ''a pain in the neck'' that was only going to get worse.</p>
        <p>Repairs to the $354 million monorail system became necessary when a design flaw allowed water to accumulate under the rail and caused damage to the heating elements that were supposed to keep the rail from icing in frigid weather. The problem was discovered last winter when ice forced the system to close for five days.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, said the estimated $25 million in repairs would be paid by the monorail's developers and operators, ADtranz, a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler that was sold in August to Bombardier Inc. The company will also pay the $9 million bill for setting up the alternative transportation system with its 60 buses, 100 additional customer service representatives and links to the Global Positioning System, which allow dispatchers to use the system's satellites to track buses and make sure that the wait  between them is no longer than five minutes.</p>
        <p>Today, Norman Boone, a control desk supervisor at the airport, sat in the control center in Terminal B, peering at the positioning system's numbered bus icons, which moved and blinked like Pac-Man symbols on a 35-inch video monitor showing the airport's spaghetti tangle of roads. The screen is meant to show when buses are bunching up or stuck in traffic, but today there were no such clusters.</p>
        <p>The months of planning for the disruption and the Port Authority's warnings that travelers should add at least 30 minutes to their travel times have left an impression.</p>
        <p>Chuck Pennewell, a pharmaceutical company sales director from Kansas City, Kan., who uses the airport regularly, began taking the buses instead of the monorail in the shakedown stages of the operation, even before he had to do so. Today, he gave himself a two-hour cushion between his arrival and his flight home.</p>
        <p>Gregg and Valarie Johannessen of Morris County, N.J., embarking on a Florida trip to celebrate the first anniversary of their wedding, had seen the news reports that the monorail would be closed and had planned their travel to and through the airport as carefully as they had planned the rest of their trip. When the couple awoke this morning to traffic alerts on the radio that some routes near the airport were clogged because of a bus accident at the Lincoln Tunnel, they sprang into action.</p>
        <p>''I panicked,'' said a winded Ms. Johannessen as she sat on an airport bus for the last leg of her journey to her flight. ''But it has all turned out positively.''</p>
