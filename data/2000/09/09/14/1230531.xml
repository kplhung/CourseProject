        <p>The Eastman Kodak Company named Daniel P. Palumbo, 42, president of its consumer imaging division. Mr. Palumbo, who joined Kodak from Procter &amp; Gamble less than four years ago, had been the division's chief marketing officer, and worked for the last year on Internet-based photographic services. Mr. Palumbo replaces Robert J. Keegan, 53, who said only that he had accepted a position elsewhere. Kodak also named Matthias Freund, 52, chief operating officer of consumer imaging. Mr. Freund had been running Qualex, Kodak's wholesale photo-finishing subsidiary.</p>
