        <p>Efforts by Malaysia to strengthen its banking system by forcing its 54 financial institutions to merge into just 10 appear to be backfiring, as concerns about government interference revive doubt about the industry's health and the risks of investing in the country.</p>
        <p>The banks had until Aug. 31 -- Malaysia's independence day -- to complete their plans and gain tax incentives for doing so. They all made it, but the deadline was followed by a drop in Malaysian stocks, reflecting investor doubts about whether the hasty unions represented workable matches.</p>
        <p>At the center of concern about the bank mergers was a deal between two of them, reached the day of the deadline, that undervalues the larger bank and overvalues the smaller one, which also happens to be connected to one of the country's top politicians.</p>
        <p>But the concern over the mergers also reflects further exasperation among investors. Malaysia, some complain, seems to prefer back-room economic deal making over a more open and accountable system that enables banks and companies to find their own solutions.</p>
        <p>''There are big doubts in investors' minds as to whether restructuring is driven by business sense or more by political interest,'' said Cher Hung Jin, a fund manager at Daiwa Securities in Singapore. Many investors wonder, he said, ''whether management has a free hand to do what's good for shareholders.''</p>
        <p>With stocks available for purchase from Wall Street to Shanghai, ''you have to offer things like transparency, earnings growth and corporate governance,'' said Chong Yoon Chou, an investment director at Aberdeen Asset Management in Singapore. ''In Malaysia's case, they've lagged behind.''</p>
        <p>Foreign investors have felt frustrated with Malaysia -- and vice versa -- since the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. The country's prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, has blamed foreign speculators for the crisis, pointing to their withdrawal of capital. In turn, foreign investors blame him for turning the country into a global pariah of finance.</p>
        <p>Yet for much of this year, Malaysia has been globalization's gadfly. Despite the refusal to let capital flow freely and the vilifying of speculators, the country's economy grew, foreigners plowed money in, and its stock market rose while a number of other markets in Southeast Asia tumbled. Dr. Mahathir gained a following as an opponent of Western free-market proselytizing, and the country has pushed ahead with its own brand of financial reform, rejecting the prescriptions of the International Monetary Fund.</p>
        <p>But then in June, foreign investors began voting with their feet. According to government statistics, they have withdrawn roughly 4.4 billion ringgit, or $1.16 billion, from Malaysia in the last three months.</p>
        <p>It is not the economy, which appears to be doing fine. Exports and domestic demand, combined with government spending and low interest rates, are fueling economic growth that J. P. Morgan predicts will reach 10 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Rather, it is the fear that foreign investors have of government policy changes that come without warning and sometimes with disregard for investors' interests.</p>
        <p>''The perceived unfriendliness toward foreign investors is stopping investments to Malaysia,'' said Chew Ping, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's in Singapore.</p>
        <p>The story of Malaysia's bank merger plan is a case in point. Cautious lending and stronger government oversight helped insulate Malaysian banks from some of the weakness suffered by banks in Indonesia and Thailand. Prime Minister Mahathir has in fact criticized Malaysian banks as too prudent, depriving enterprises of funds.</p>
        <p>Yet most financial executives agree that there are too many banks and that the government's plans to deregulate the industry means that some of those banks must be merged with others. But in July 1999, the central bank decreed that there be only six banks in the country within eight weeks and told each bank who would be taking over whom.</p>
        <p>Bankers were stunned. Smaller institutions in some cases were to take over larger banks and weaker banks to take over stronger ones. The shotgun engagements also threatened to reduce the financial power of the country's economically dominant ethnic Chinese in favor of its numerically dominant Malays.</p>
        <p>Three months later, there was an abrupt policy reversal. The government capitulated to private lobbying by bankers and agreed to let them find their own partners. This past February, the bankers won approval to merge into 10 institutions by the end of this year. A package of tax incentives was later thrown in for those who made their merger plans final by the end of July.</p>
        <p>Progress toward meeting the deadline was delayed by a group that fund managers say is often ignored in Malaysia: shareholders. But they were not just any shareholders. Plans for the country's largest financial institution, Malayan Banking, to take over a smaller one, Phileo Allied Bank, stalled when a minority shareholder controlled by Prime Minister Mahathir's son balked at the sale price. Such disputes led the central bank to extend its deadline by a month, to the end of August.</p>
