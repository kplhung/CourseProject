        <p>Many Congressional Republicans have decided that the big across-the-board tax reduction advocated by their party's presidential nominee does not play well in their races for re-election and have instead adopted a strategy that emphasizes debt reduction and bite-size tax cuts.</p>
        <p>While many of them refuse to criticize the $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Republican candidates and incumbents on the campaign trail and in Congress have distanced themselves from his 10-year plan.</p>
        <p>Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican who is running for the House seat being vacated by Representative John R. Kasich, said voters were ''not especially'' intrigued by Mr. Bush's tax plan.</p>
        <p>''What I am hearing more about this year are specific things, and the two specific things I'm hearing a lot about are the death tax and the marriage tax.''</p>
        <p>Some Republican lawmakers say that Mr. Bush is repeating the mistake they made in 1999 when they pushed a tax-cut plan that totaled $800 billion over 10 years. After President Clinton refused to sign the bill, Republicans found so little public support for the proposal that they did not even try to override the veto.</p>
        <p>This year, Republicans broke their tax-cut proposals into smaller chunks, including one that would eliminate the so-called marriage penalty and another that would have abolished federal estate taxes. Though Mr. Clinton has also vetoed these proposals, Republicans say they are not shy about making them campaign issues in their attempt to hold on to their control of the House and the Senate.</p>
        <p>''I think it's just an individual emphasis,'' said Melissa Hart, a Pennsylvania Republican campaigning for the seat now held by Representative Ron Klink, a Democrat who is retiring. ''It's easier to get your arms around, especially the marriage penalty.''</p>
        <p>Republican candidates for the House and Senate are running television advertisements that mostly focus on specific tax cuts, like ending the marriage penalty. Among those candidates who are taking a more cautious approach is Representative Rick A. Lazio, who is in a tight race with Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate seat from New York and who has proposed a more modest tax-reduction plan than Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Bush has made his large tax cut the centerpiece of his campaign, a move that baffles some Congressional Republicans.</p>
        <p>''Bush is trapped,'' said an aide to a Republican House leader who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''He's where we were in 1999. He's talking about a big tax plan this year. Voters just want to know what's in the tax plan, the components, not a big number.''</p>
        <p>Some Republican strategists say that talking about a huge lump-sum tax cut gives Democrats the opportunity to attack it as a sop to the wealthy. Indeed, the Bush campaign has in recent days tried to counter such attacks by showcasing families at campaign rallies and detailing how the tax-cut plan would aid them.</p>
        <p>''People are not aware of what the Bush package calls for,'' said Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster. ''If they are just looking at the overall package and hear Gore talk about tax cuts for the wealthy, they tend to win. If we break down the tax package, we tend to win.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, some Republicans embrace Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan.</p>
        <p>''I think highly of his tax package,'' said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. ''We have to do a better job of selling the tax cut. They have to talk about the elements of it; if not, it never works. We learned that battle last year.''</p>
        <p>And some Republicans say a major reason for any differences in emphasis is the differences in the offices that Mr. Bush and Congressional candidates are seeking. While presidential candidates tend to campaign on grand themes, those running for the House and Senate tend to push more measured proposals and more measured goals.</p>
        <p>''The difference is running for the Senate, rather than running for president,'' said Stuart Roy, spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''It's more salient for our candidates to talk about specific programs, and it's more believable. It's not believable that one single senator would be able to pass an expanded tax bill.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, disputed the notion that there was any significant difference in emphasis between what the Republican presidential candidate is pushing on the stump and what Republican candidates for Congress are emphasizing.</p>
        <p>''All the smaller targeted tax cuts make up our tax cut -- marriage penalty relief, death tax repeal, abolition of the earnings limit,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''Those were all put forth in Congress this year and, of course, Congress has the burden of dealing with the president, who would rather spend more money than deliver tax relief.''</p>
        <p>Choosing to push smaller tax cuts rather than rallying around Mr. Bush's tax-reduction plan has not necessarily made things easier for Republicans.</p>
        <p>Stymied by Mr. Clinton's vetoes of their estate-tax and marriage-penalty bills, Congressional Republicans on Tuesday introduced a proposal to apply what they said was 90 percent of next year's budget surplus to reduce the national debt.</p>
        <p>Though Republicans spoke of their proposal as committing 90 percent of next year's expected $268 billion surplus -- about $240 billion -- to paying down the national debt, a closer look at the plan reveals the new commitment to debt reduction is more modest.</p>
        <p>Since $198 billion of the expected surplus will be in the Social Security and Medicare trust funds -- two accounts that Congress has vowed not to use for spending programs or tax cuts -- that money would be applied to the national debt anyway.</p>
        <p>Thus the Republicans' plan only commits $42 billion in new funds -- or about 16 percent -- of the surplus for debt reduction. The idea is aimed at giving Republicans a politically palatable opening position in the budget negotiations with the White House, but the effect is to push them even farther away from Mr. Bush, who seldom mentions debt reduction.</p>
        <p>Democrats gleefully pointed out the differences between the Republicans' new stress on reducing the national debt and Mr. Bush's emphasis on slashing tax rates.</p>
        <p>''Did he get the message that tax cuts are out?'' chortled Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. ''They should make some ads and send a subliminal message to George Bush that tax cuts are not popular. Big time, as we say.''</p>
        <p>Democratic leaders and administration officials today disparaged the Republicans' latest proposal to use some of the surplus to reduce the national debt.</p>
        <p>''The American people aren't buying these huge tax cuts, and Republicans are scrambling to get away from them,'' said Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader.</p>
