        <p>Re ''After 75 Years, a Radio Show Is Dropped'' (news article, Sept. 12):</p>
        <p>As upsetting as it is to see that ''Rambling With Gambling'' has been dropped by WOR-AM, it is even more disturbing to hear once again that advertisers have little interest in reaching listeners over 50.</p>
        <p>Even if some people over 50 are less likely to change the brands they use, tens of millions of these same people spend many billions of dollars on their grandchildren, including buying new things and new brands that the grandparents never use themselves. Thoughtful advertisers will continue to find ways to get their messages through to all those grandparents spending their money on their children's children.</p>
