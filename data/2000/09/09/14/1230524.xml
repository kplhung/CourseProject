        <p>Cliff Meidl, a sprint kayaker who has survived more than just turbulent waters and stiff competition, was chosen as the flagbearer for the United States Olympic team in the opening ceremony on Friday. Meidl was elected in a vote by the American team, and chosen over a list of other candidates that included Brandi Chastain, Teresa Edwards and Dara Torres.</p>
        <p>A 34-year-old from Redondo Beach, Calif., Meidl was nearly killed in 1986 while working as a plumber's apprentice. He struck through some high-voltage cables and absorbed 30,000 volts of electricity. The jolt lifted him in the air and his knees were severely damaged when he landed. Twice he went into cardiac arrest.</p>

Twice he went into cardiac arrest.</p>
        <p>Doctors performed radical surgery and were able to avoid amputating his legs.</p>
        <p>Years of rehabilitation led to Meidl's taking up paddling, and he qualified for the 1996 Games in Atlanta.</p>
