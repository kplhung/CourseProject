        <p>As onlookers applauded from the gallery, the Supreme Court today rebuffed a final government plea to reopen a treason case against Aleksandr Nikitin, the former navy captain who gave nuclear opponents details of radioactive pollution by Russian submarines.</p>
        <p>The decision ended -- for good, apparently -- the government's five-year prosecution of Mr. Nikitin, a pursuit that had become an international human rights and environmental issue.</p>
        <p>It also gave support to President Vladimir V. Putin's claim that he is establishing supremacy of the law in a society that has operated mostly outside the rules since the collapse of the Soviet Union nine years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has suggested that Russia's environmental movement is a threat to national security and a tool of foreign interests. And it was during his tenure as head of the Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B.'s domestic arm, that the government's campaign against Mr. Nikitin reached a head.</p>
        <p>But the Kremlin stood aside earlier this year when the Supreme Court first ruled that the government had no case against Mr. Nikitin, and it seems to have stood aside again now when the court rejected prosecutors requests' to reopen the charges.</p>
        <p>Today a jubilant Mr. Nikitin called the decision ''a very, very small step toward creating a state ruled by law.'' One expert and former American diplomat in Russia, Thomas Graham of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, seconded that appraisal.</p>
        <p>''The Supreme Court made an encouraging decision,'' he said in a telephone interview from Washington, ''but there are a lot of other worrying signs that this might be the exception as opposed to the pattern in Russia.''</p>
        <p>Russia's progress toward democratic rule has fallen into doubt lately among some critics, who see a shift toward authoritarianism in the Kremlin's attempts to silence critical news media.</p>
        <p>Nor is Mr. Nikitin the only environmental activist under legal attack. Grigory Pasko, a journalist for a naval newspaper in Russia's Pacific Fleet, was also acquitted last year of treason charges brought after he discussed the fleet's environmental and financial policies with Japanese journalists.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors are seeking to reopen that case as well, although Mr. Pasko's lawyers argue that military censors had cleared all the information he discussed with the Japanese.</p>
        <p>Supporters of both Mr. Pasko and Mr. Nikitin argue that the prosecutions show not only the continuing power of the Federal Security Service and the intelligence apparatus within Russian society, but also the service's refusal to recognize that the nation now operates under a more open political system.</p>
        <p>The Federal Security Service arrested Mr. Nikitin in 1996 after he wrote reports for Bellona, a Norwegian environmental group, detailing radioactive pollution in the Arctic seas. He also reported on the Soviet Union's practice of dumping nuclear waste at sea from the 1960's through the 1980's, and on reactor safety systems aboard nuclear subs of the same class as the Kursk, which sank almost a month ago in the Barents Sea, killing 118 crewmen.</p>
        <p>Government prosecutors imprisoned Mr. Nikitin for 10 months and charged him with espionage and high treason.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nikitin and Bellona insisted that the information was unclassified and, in any case, did not threaten national security, arguments that eventually won over the judge in a trial in St. Petersburg City Court last year.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court affirmed that decision this year, and refused today to let the prosecutors try again.</p>
        <p>Today the president of Bellona, Frederic Hauge, said the verdict showed Russians that ''if you fight, you can win -- and they need to see that in this country.''</p>
