        <p>Athletes from North and South Korea will march into Sydney's Olympic Stadium as one nation tomorrow, in what should prove one of the emotional highlights of the Games' opening ceremony. Though the two nations will compete separately, their decision to march together under a single white flag with a blue depiction of an undivided peninsula should be greeted as another significant step toward reconciliation. The joint march will also be a tribute to the Olympic aspiration that sports can break down barriers between people.</p>
        <p>Koreans have experienced a perceptible thaw in relations ever since the June meeting in Pyongyang between South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il.  Yesterday Kim Jong Il agreed to visit Seoul next spring. An exchange of family visits last month that brought together relatives who had not heard from each other in a half-century transfixed South Korea and served as a reminder to the rest of the world of the lingering tragedy that Korea's division represents. More such family visits are planned, and South Korea has agreed to import grain to provide to its hunger-stricken Communist neighbor. Both countries, still technically at war since their conflict ended with a mere truce in 1953, have also agreed to rebuild the rail link between them.</p>

        <p>Koreans have experienced a perceptible thaw in relations ever since the June meeting in Pyongyang between South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il.  Yesterday Kim Jong Il agreed to visit Seoul next spring. An exchange of family visits last month that brought together relatives who had not heard from each other in a half-century transfixed South Korea and served as a reminder to the rest of the world of the lingering tragedy that Korea's division represents. More such family visits are planned, and South Korea has agreed to import grain to provide to its hunger-stricken Communist neighbor. Both countries, still technically at war since their conflict ended with a mere truce in 1953, have also agreed to rebuild the rail link between them.</p>
        <p>Beyond the Olympics, South Korea is to play host, along with Japan, to the other major global sporting event, soccer's 2002 World Cup. Organizers are already discussing the possibility of holding one or two matches in reclusive North Korea. That would be another valuable step toward reconciliation brought about by sports.</p>
