        <p>Following are excerpts from the senatorial debate last night between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rick A. Lazio as transcribed by The New York Times. The debate was held in Buffalo and broadcast live on NBC stations across the state. Its moderator was Tim Russert of NBC. The full text is available at The New York Times on the Web at www.nytimes.com.</p>
        <p>Patients' Bill of Rights</p>
        <p>LAZIO: . . . If you look at my record, it's a record of independence in the House, whether it's standing up on the environment or on funding for the arts or on a whole range of other issues I've been able to stake my claim and have a record that's reflective of New York.</p>
        <p>You know, I was also the person who sponsored legislation to help cancer patients. Also the person to help root out Medicaid fraud with legislation. I've been a doer. I haven't been passive. I've gotten things done. And yes, sometimes that means you have to stand on principle even when it's not politically popular.</p>
        <p>But in this case we did protect patients two different ways. The end result is that you've got to get the job done. . . . And I'm proud of my record.</p>
        <p>CLINTON: . . . Listening to the congressman's response reminds me of a word I've heard a lot of this past year: chutzpah. He stands here and tells us that he's a moderate, mainstream, independent member of Congress. Well, in fact, he was a deputy whip to Newt Gingrich. He voted to shut the government down. He voted to cut $270 billion from Medicare. He voted for the biggest education cuts in our history. . . .</p>
        <p>Upstate Economy</p>
        <p>CLINTON: Well, I think everybody in upstate wants to do what will work to turn the economy around. And I've set forth my ideas. I'm open to any other ideas from the mayor and anyone else. And what I want everyone to know is that I will use my 30 years of experience, my last eight years in the White House to bring to bear not just the votes that I cast or the speeches I make on the floor of the Senate. . . .</p>
        <p>LAZIO: Well, I have to go back to Mrs. Clinton's last remark because it has to redefine the word chutzpah. Mrs. Clinton, you of all people shouldn't try to make guilt by association. Newt Gingrich isn't running in this race. I'm running in this race. Let's talk about my record. . . .</p>
        <p>Every year we send $15 billion a year more to Washington than we get back. And it's at it's worst point ever under this administration. . . .</p>
        <p>The Lewinsky Matter</p>
        <p>CLINTON: That was a very, a very painful time for me, for my family and for our country. It is something that I regret deeply that anyone had to go through. . . . But from my perspective, you know, I'm very hopeful that we can go forward in a united way.</p>
        <p>That certainly is what I've tried to do. And I've tried to be as forthcoming as I could given the circumstances that I faced. Obviously I didn't mislead anyone. I didn't know the truth. . . .</p>
        <p>Jonathan Pollard</p>
        <p>CLINTON: . . . What Mr. Pollard did was a terrible crime against the United States. It was a great breach of trust and national security and he plead guilty, was convicted and is serving a very long prison term. When I looked into this I think that everyone who has an opinion about it agrees that what he did was absolutely wrong. The question for me is around the due process issues concerning the way that he was sentenced. . . .</p>
        <p>LAZIO: . . . Last, in fact, December of 1998, President Clinton made a statement. He said that he was going to complete a review on Jonathan Pollard on Jan. 11 of 1999 and issue an explanation as to whether or not clemency would be granted. And of course the president is the only one who can issue clemency.</p>
        <p>Well 600 days have gone by and still no answer. I think the president owes it to us to make a decision . . .</p>
        <p>Campaign Finance</p>
        <p>LAZIO: . . . I'm willing to not raise a dime of soft money, not spend a dime of soft money and call on all outside groups to stay away from this race and not spend any money in furtherance of my campaign. . . .</p>
        <p>CLINTON: . . . Back in May I made exactly that offer. I said, let's forgo soft money. But let's also be sure we don't have these independent expenditures . . . And I said, you know, if you would do this, I would certainly abide by it. If you will get signed agreements from all your friends who say they're raising $32 million and will not be running so-called independent ads . . . I think we can have an agreement.</p>
        <p>RUSSERT: Do we have a deal, Mr. Lazio?</p>
        <p>LAZIO: Who said -- I -- I -- I'd like to get it done today.</p>
        <p>RUSSERT: Will you get those signed agreements?</p>
        <p>LAZIO: Yeah, I'd be happy to. But I want you to be the -- I want to get it done right now. I don't want any more wriggle room. I don't want any more evasion. The truth is, Tim, is that Mrs. Clinton has been airing millions of dollars in soft-money ads. It's the height of hypocrisy to talk about soft money when she's been raising soft money by the bucketloads out in Hollywood and spending all that money on negative advertising. . . . Let's just get this deal done right now.</p>
        <p>RUSSERT: Can I give Mrs. Clinton?</p>
        <p>LAZIO: Right here, here it is. Let's sign it. It's -- it's the New York Freedom of Soft Money Pact. I signed it. We can -- we can both sit down together. We can all get all the media in here. We will make sure it's an ironclad deal. And . . . I'm happy to -- to abide by anything that we all agree on. But let's get it done now. Let's not get any more wriggle room.</p>
        <p>RUSSERT: Mrs. Clinton, do you want to respond?</p>
        <p>CLINTON: Well, yes, I certainly do. You know, I -- I -- I -- I admire that. That was a wonderful performance and I ----</p>
        <p>LAZIO: Well, why don't you just sign it?</p>
        <p>CLINTON:. And you -- and you did it very well.</p>
        <p>LAZIO: I'm not asking you to admire it. I'm asking you to sign it.</p>
        <p>CLINTON: Well, I would be happy to, when you give me the signed letters ----</p>
        <p>LAZIO: Well, right here. Right here.</p>
        <p>CLINTON: When you give me ----</p>
        <p>LAZIO: Right here, sign it right now.</p>
        <p>CLINTON: Well -- well, we'll shake -- we'll shake on this ----</p>
        <p>LAZIO: No, no, I want your signature. Because I think that everybody wants to see you signing something that you said you were for. I'm for it. I haven't done it. You've been violating it. . . .</p>
        <p>CLINTON: And -- and this new radio ad from the Republican Party using soft money is not part of your campaign.</p>
        <p>LAZIO: Oh, well, what are we talking about here? No, let's just put things in perspective.</p>
        <p>RUSSERT: . . . We are out of time.</p>
