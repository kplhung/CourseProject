        <p>On an urban agenda that includes weighty matters like crumbling schools, crime and homelessness, New York City's rat problem may seem pesky, even the butt of jokes. But for C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, rats have become a crusade.</p>
        <p>''This is an epidemic, and I will continue to fight for greater resources,'' Ms. Fields said in a news conference on the rat problem yesterday, her fourth on the subject since the rodents were found overrunning sections of the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in early July.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Fields, a Democrat who so far faces no announced opposition for re-election in 2001, has been generating headlines with her rat fight, her vigilance is also provoking a pesky conflict with City Hall, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his staff seem to delight in poking fun at the problem.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Joseph J. Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, responded to Ms. Fields's criticism. Mr. Lhota, who heads a rat abatement task force formed by the mayor in July, has been the focus of much ribbing by the mayor, who went so far as to refer to him as ''my deputy mayor for rats'' in an August appearance on the ''Late Show With David Letterman.'' (Mr. Letterman had mined ''Manhattan's giant rats'' as a source of material for months.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lhota chimed in with a joke of his own yesterday, speaking to reporters below a banner above his office door. One line read Allied Command Headquarters. Another read The Rat Czar.</p>
        <p>''Our job is to eradicate rats,'' the deputy mayor said, turning his joke into an attack on Ms. Fields. ''It is not to please a borough president who has nothing better to do with her time than to hold press conferences on a subject she knows nothing about.''</p>
        <p>In her earlier comments to reporters, Ms. Fields criticized the Department of Health most sharply for failing to respond to complaints that had been phoned in to a special toll-free ''rat complaint hot line'' that her office had created on July 18.</p>
        <p>She said that of 365 complaints her staff had forwarded to the Health Department since the line was established, the department had replied to only 2 by sending out inspectors or crews with rat poison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lhota responded by calling the borough president's special phone  line a ''duplicative bureaucratic mistake,'' since the Health Department has operated its own pest control phone line for years.</p>
        <p>He said that the pest control line had received far more complaints about rats than the one set up by Ms. Fields (2,622 in August alone), and that inspectors and other department employees had been dispatched to as many as 1,000 more locations in the city than those identified by the people who called.</p>
        <p>''I have instructed the Department of Health to eradicate rats, not get involved in a bureaucratic morass,'' Mr. Lhota said. ''We have dealt with all her complaints.''</p>
        <p>Last night, with the dispute erupting into a duel of the hot lines, Ms. Fields did not seem to be backing off.</p>
        <p>''The complaints we referred to the Health Department are legitimate, and they have not responded,'' said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for Ms. Fields. She contended that Mr. Lhota had ''just come up with an excuse for not keeping up with the workload.''</p>
