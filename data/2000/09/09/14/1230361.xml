        <p>When Arena Stage, the leading nonprofit theater here, presented the world premiere of ''The Great White Hope,'' the regional theater movement was in its infancy even though Arena itself, founded by Zelda Fichandler in 1950, was already a teenager. It was December 1967, and the show, directed by Edwin Sherin and starring James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander, and financed partly by the fledgling National Endowment for the Arts, made history.</p>
        <p>Written by Howard Sackler, it is set just before and during World War I, but it was very much a play of the moment, rife with the righteous anguish of the civil rights movement and the ire of liberal opposition to the Vietnam War. It was based on the life of the boxer Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight champion, who was forced to flee the country on a trumped-up morals charge because of his romantic liaison with a white woman. But the spirit of the play -- its flaming indignation -- was fueled by a coincidence: the contemporary plight of Muhammad Ali, who in April 1967 was stripped of his heavyweight title when he refused to be inducted into the Army, having claimed conscientious objector status and famously declared: ''I ain't got no quarrel with the Vietcong. No Vietcong ever called me nigger.''</p>
        <p>With a mammoth cast of 62 actors (including Ned Beatty, Antonio Vargas, Robert Prosky and Hector Elizondo), a virulent anti-racist theme often evoked by characters mouthing the vilest language of bigotry, a narrative that chases the characters all over the United States, to Europe and back to Mexico and Cuba, and a towering performance by Mr. Jones as the proud and beleaguered champ (he's called Jack Jefferson in the play), this was not a work to be contained by the theatrical provinces.</p>
        <p>And indeed, the following October Herman Levin, best known as the producer of ''My Fair Lady,'' moved the show -- including the director, the two stars and much of the supporting cast -- to the Alvin Theater on West 52nd Street (now the Neil Simon), making it the first production ever to transfer from a nonprofit resident theater to Broadway. There it ran for more than 500 performances and won three Tonys -- best play, best actor and best actress. The play, which also won the Pulitzer Prize, has rarely been staged anywhere since.</p>
        <p>All of which makes the rousing, provocative and fascinatingly problematic revival of ''The Great White Hope'' now at the Arena through Oct. 15 an event of significance. Directed by Molly Smith, beginning her third year as the Arena's artistic director, it is the first production of the theater's 50th anniversary season, and it is perfectly chosen as a celebration of its history.</p>
        <p>It is also a potent reminder of the vast changes that have been wrought in the American theater landscape over the past three decades, particularly at a time when the most prominent American plays and musicals are developed in the regional houses before they ever come to Broadway and when commercial producers and nonprofit theaters routinely engage in financial and artistic partnerships. It is astonishing to recall that in 1968 such arrangements were so new that the Arena let ''The Great White Hope'' -- still the most important production in its history, and at the time its most expensive -- go to Broadway (and the movies) without claiming any financial interest in it or any artistic credit.</p>
        <p>The play itself is a monster, a narrative with an epic arc, tracing the rocketlike rise of Jefferson and the long, agonizing persecution that costs him his livelihood, kills the woman he loves and in the end unmans him entirely. ''The Great White Hope'' is replete with mob scenes, party scenes, court hearings, gym workouts and family gatherings, with settings in a German beer garden, a Budapest cabaret and a barn in Juarez, among other exotic locales. There are monologues by white and black characters who address the audience with the rhetoric of race warfare, and there is one sizzling bedroom encounter. It is a work of colossal immodesty that even admiring critics of the original found occasionally overstuffed with bluster. But it was theatrically outrageous in the service of grand spiritual outrage, and in that, critics agreed, lay its power.</p>
        <p>The play, Walter Kerr wrote in The New York Times, is ''about a man who is afraid of nothing written by a man who is not afraid of the theater.''</p>
        <p>''Two kinds of boldness blinking, throat open for a cockcrow, come together to create a blood-stained circus,'' Kerr wrote, ''the most unabashed dramatic outburst we have had since 'Long Day's Journey Into Night.' ''</p>
        <p>This is precisely the spirit that Ms. Smith's vigorous staging seeks out, often successfully. Indeed, a circus is the controlling metaphor for her production, with the stage painted in bright icons that suggest a Big Top -- the Arena's mainstage is a theater in the round -- and calliope music introducing the Jefferson saga as a savage tale of show business. She makes full use of the auditorium, with characters parading down the aisles and around the top tier of seats as well as entering from beneath the stage through sliding panels in the floor. Pageantry abounds; the period costumes are elegant. Props and scenery drop from the rafters on rope and wire. And the cast, reduced to 28 actors, most in multiple roles, seems to be in perpetual motion.</p>
        <p>Over all, it's terrific in its enthusiasms, even in the scenes -- like the Budapest cabaret, where Jefferson is humiliatingly reduced to performing in a burlesque of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' -- that Ms. Smith can't reclaim from the playwright's overindulgence. That particular scene is a real squirm-inducer, played here for egregious grotesquerie, but even so, like the rest of the production, it has the director's bravado imprinted on it.</p>
        <p>One effect of this is that the spectacle overwhelms the story. This may be purposeful, and it may be unavoidable. The race relations depicted in Sackler's script are thorough, in a way; Jefferson is criticized by some black characters (not all of whom are noble or even likable) for his aspirations to success in the white world, and he himself refuses to be a symbol of black pride. But the rhetoric of the early 20th century is so blatantly and viciously uncomplicated that many of the white characters sound clownishly villainous, the black ones embarrassingly defeated.</p>
        <p>And without the palpable current of racial violence that was running through society in the 1960's -- Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated between the play's original run at the Arena and its opening on Broadway -- it's tough for actors to find credible readings for some implacably racist lines. Such an attitude no longer seems dramatic or even reasonably realistic as a widely held or expressed position; it's merely dismissible stupidity. It's a real problem when an actor's boldest, most earnest efforts in a period role turn him into a buffoon for the audience.</p>
        <p>Then, too, the idea of a prominent black athlete who is a wealthy, self-assured and even arrogant man and might well be a sex symbol is not only no longer shocking or threatening, it's familiar and even cool. Ali, announcing his conversion to Islam at a news conference in 1964 at which he was accompanied by Malcolm X, was to many white Americans a threat. Today he's our benign and grandfatherly hero.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sherin, the director of the original production, said the playwright, who died in 1982, ''didn't have Ali in mind at all; he had Jack Johnson in mind.''</p>
        <p>''Howard chose this character because he reminded him of a Shakespearean hero,'' Mr. Sherin said. ''What he wanted you to think of was Coriolanus. I was with him through much of the writing and all of the rewriting, and the name Ali never came up. That was just happenstance. That was just hitting on a historic wave. But I was present when Ali saw the production. He ran up on stage -- this was when it was over and everybody'd left -- and said: 'It's me. It's me. This is my story.' ''</p>
        <p>I didn't see the original, but to judge from the 1971 film, James Earl Jones played Jefferson as a supremely confident man, intimidating in both his physical grace and the persistent rumble of his self-possession. He was very much like the young Ali, albeit pitched to a lower octave. Mahershala Karim Ali, the young actor who plays Jefferson in the current production, strikes a much more modern pose. He has a breathtaking physique, Nautilus-buffed, with cobblestone abs and wide shoulders, but he's not the man-mountain that Jones was. He's lithe. With his shaved head and sinewy muscles, he calls up the image of Michael Jordan.</p>
        <p>His performance, too, seems purposely derived from the contemporary athlete, fickle and moody, the self-assurance flickering. His Jefferson can intimidate with his anger and barbed humor, the implicit threat of brawn, but it's a learned demeanor, concealing the insecurity of youth. His most affecting scenes are with the woman he loves, Ellie Bachman (Kelly C. McAndrew), when they're alone, away from the world that demands so much of him.</p>
        <p>The inevitable effect of all of this is to render Jefferson less heroic, less of a symbol. Watching ''The Great White Hope,'' you can't help but will yourself back into the past to find its potent drama. Michael Jordan hasn't suffered like Ali, after all, and he hasn't changed the world.</p>
        <p>In the last scene, Jefferson is finally compromised, lured back into the ring with the promise that if he loses to the white challenger, his legal persecution will end. Whether he throws the fight is unclear. At the final bell, sad and stoop-shouldered, he tells a reporter: ''He beat me, dassall. Ah juss din have it.'' Meanwhile, the victorious challenger, his face awash in sweat and blood, stands ebullient, draped in the American flag. The metaphorical suggestions -- that black America has been evilly sublimated and that white America, if triumphant, has been bloodied -- seem almost quaint in their ardor.</p>
        <p>Thirty-three years after its premiere, ''The Great White Hope'' is more than quaint; it's a theatrical monument, really, a historical marker in more ways than one. This estimable revival at the Arena Stage is very much at home.</p>
