        <p>Neon-colored worms are running amok in architecture, if ''10 x 10,'' a sampling of recent projects around the globe, is to be believed. The publisher (Phaidon Press, $59.95) asked 10 critics on five continents to name 10 hot, youngish architects, then devoted four pages to each. Many nominees, like Neil M. Denari of Los Angeles, submitted similar-looking neon-colored proposals (bottom). Whether they are going to be built, or even could be, I'm not sure. Some project descriptions come not with specifics but with theoretical praise for the designers' ability to, say, ''reverse the failure of much 'negative space' by attempting to offer a critique of the notion of fragmentation and deformation as well as the potential discovery of a new spatiality,'' as Roger Connah describes Anamorphosis' work in Athens. Equally impenetrable are layouts involving white text on a black background. It buzzes before the eyes like Op Art.</p>

        <p>Neon-colored worms are running amok in architecture, if ''10 x 10,'' a sampling of recent projects around the globe, is to be believed.

Equally impenetrable are layouts involving white text on a black background. It buzzes before the eyes like Op Art.</p>
        <p>Patient readers who slog through the collection will find a few designs that are either environmentally thoughtful or technologically innovative, and also clearly explained. Among the highlights are Sarah Wigglesworth and Jeremy Till's London town house with walls of baled straw, below, and Dunne &amp; Raby's amusingly impractical proposal for a telephone table that would glow green when someone called, inset. The book includes a few readable essays, too; the best is by the playwright David Mamet, reflecting on radical 60's buildings: they seem to foreshadow the fate of the book's fluorescent proposals in that they ''all either fell down or are falling down or should be torn down.''</p>
