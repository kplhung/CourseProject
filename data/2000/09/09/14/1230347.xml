And only one of them has been able to treat the city as his personal Monopoly board or modestly attempt to turn his name into a modifier.

        <p>THE TRUMPS  Three Generations That Built an Empire  By Gwenda Blair  Illustrated. 591 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $30.</p>
        <p>In Gwenda Blair's copiously researched study of the Trump family, readers can learn the academic credentials of the director of Donald Trump's nursery school and the fact that building with blocks was a main part of this future mogul's curriculum. Also established are the colors of the boys' uniforms (gray shorts and green shirts) at Camp Hilltop and the fact that counselors kept records about the bowel movements and other digestive progress of their charges.</p>
        <p>On the psychological front the author identifies Donald, who was born in 1946, as part of a faux-firstborn generation emerging immediately after World War II and apt to be assertive and successful, regardless of exact birth order. Maybe so, but not all these people have been able to plaster their names across the New York skyline. And only one of them has been able to treat the city as his personal Monopoly board or modestly attempt to turn his name into a modifier. (''You're looking very Trump today,'' read a 1987 billboard in Atlantic City, the auxiliary Trump playground.) As to what really makes Donald run, Ms. Blair's investigative account doesn't offer much of a clue.</p>
        <p>It can be argued that enough has been said about Donald Trump anyway, mostly by Mr. Trump himself, and that this exhaustive book is a no-win proposition. In her attempt to eclipse the mogul's own self-puffery and his invaluable presence as a gossip-column fixture, Ms. Blair has dug back two generations to the first Trump (actually Drumpf) presence on American soil.</p>
        <p>She has doggedly compiled the family history of a grandfather (Friedrich, later Frederick), father (Fred) and glitz-seeking Wunderkind, but the focus of her account is uncertain. There are readers who want to know about the Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, known as Ulurp, ''the city's complex zoning approval process,'' and others who wonder what Donald Trump's former consorts and employees might have to say. Try as she may to steer an even course between these polarities, Ms. Blair winds up with a landslide of Ulurp and little dish.</p>
        <p>The book has its most obvious trouble in cobbling together the mostly undocumented story of Friedrich, who arrived in 1885 from southwestern Germany. (The family would later occasionally represent itself as Swedish.) Before settling down to adult life as a barber, he lived adventurously in the Pacific Northwest in the midst of gold miners, for whose benefit he ran a series of restaurants.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blair assembles evidence that the ''dressmakers'' who could be found at these establishments were actually prostitutes, which would not have been entirely shocking in that setting, and which at least is better proved than some of the more dubious details here. Did Friedrich serve horse meat in his restaurants, for example? Maybe not, ''but if he was like everyone else, he did what the locals did -- went out and cut up a piece of old Nelly.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Blair is on more solid ground with the story of how Fred Trump carved out a real estate empire in Brooklyn. Also richly endowed with the family moxie, he initially learned the building trade through Y.M.C.A. and correspondence courses while also developing expertise in finding legal loopholes within Federal Housing Administration regulations. ''Without the F.H.A. Fred Trump would have been running a supermarket,'' Ms. Blair asserts. ''With the F.H.A. he was the biggest builder in Brooklyn, employing hundreds of construction workers and turning out  400 homes a year.''</p>
        <p>Frederick Christ Trump (whose middle name was his mother's family name, and who did not create further hubris problems by passing it on to Donald) earned a reputation for dedication. He dressed in a coat and tie to tour the houses he had built and to greet residents. During one construction project near Coney Island he installed bathing lockers so workers could swim on their breaks.</p>
        <p>Even at the height of his success, he remained ''a man who would still spend an entire afternoon meticulously explaining to a maintenance man how to mix liquid cockroach spray so as to avoid calling an exterminator.'' In the words of one acquaintance, ''He never tried to impress anybody with his wealth,'' and ''He didn't seem to care if anybody had ever heard of him,'' proving how far an apple can fall from a tree.</p>
        <p>The section devoted to Donald (other relatives are all but invisible) combines pearls of hindsight (''You could tell he was going to get somewhere'') with a litany of deal-making details for which an appreciation of tax abatements and housing codes would be welcome. What emerges is Ms. Blair's portrait of her subject as a germ-phobic anti-Gatsby:</p>
        <p>''He had no desire to pass for old money himself and considered most of those who benefited from it to be phonies; likewise he was not at all reticent about how he made his money but took every opportunity to boast about just how clever he had been. Nor was there a Daisy at whose feet he wished to lay himself and his material possessions.''</p>
        <p>In place of Gatsby's poignant display of his shirts, we have Mr. Trump telling reporters: ''See this railing? Same railing Onassis had on his boat.''</p>
        <p>In ''Almost Golden,'' her haunting book about the driven television reporter Jessica Savitch, Ms. Blair also wrote about raging ambition, and did it in a way that made readers complicit in Ms. Savitch's relentlessness. But in that regard Donald Trump has beaten any biographer to the punch. ''The Trumps'' does trace his apotheosis as a star and brand name more valuable than any 65th-story penthouse (which, incidentally, would in the creatively labeled Trump Tower actually be on the 59th floor). But it also finds him in full control of his own image and reputation, impregnable to the kinds of details that emerge here. From his father and grandfather, as Ms. Blair does illustrate, he inherited the ability to make lemons into lemonade.</p>
        <p>''You know what I think,'' he remarked while heavily in debt and having to sell property on the auction block. ''I think there's something very sophisticated and intelligent about auctions.''</p>
