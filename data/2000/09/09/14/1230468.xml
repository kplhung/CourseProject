        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Safety Can Cost Too Much'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 8), Robert A. Levy makes the important and frequently misunderstood point that improved safety always comes with a hidden tradeoff.</p>
        <p>This tradeoff is never the ''win-win'' situation that consumer advocates would like us to believe. Indeed, the Ralph Naders of the world do the consumer a grave disservice when, as self-declared consumer representatives, they demand ''safety at all costs.'' This simplistic credo, if taken literally, would lead to products that no one but the rich could afford.</p>

        <p>This tradeoff is never the ''win-win'' situation that consumer advocates would like us to believe.

        <p>In the final analysis, issues of safety are best determined by free choice, through the mutually beneficial relationship between the manufacturer and the consumer. After all, when the government makes decisions for us, we invariably lose more than we gain.</p>
