        <p>Brad Friedel remembers the United States soccer team that went to the Summer Games in Barcelona eight years ago. ''Two professionals on the entire team,'' he recalled tonight.</p>
        <p>This time it is different. The United States started 10 professionals and one very impressive college forward, Conor Casey, and outplayed the Czech Republic almost all the way in a 2-2 tie tonight in the opening round of the Summer Games tournament.</p>
        <p>The tie was a blow to the Czechs, who lumbered and labored to stay with the Americans for much of the night. A penalty kick in the 52nd minute allowed the Czechs to break even, but they treated the outcome as a loss. ''They got through our defenses all night, no matter what we did,'' Czech Coach Karel Bruckner said.</p>
        <p>The United States, which has never won a medal in Olympic soccer, will play Cameroon here Saturday and Kuwait in Melbourne on Tuesday, but this was a significant point. The tournament began two days before the Olympics' opening ceremony, because the soccer format is too long for the 16 official days of the Games.</p>
        <p>Friedel, the reserve goalkeeper for Liverpool in the English Premier Division, was called to the American team two weeks ago when the regular goalkeeper, Adin Brown, was hurt.</p>
        <p>Friedel, 29, and looking a bit grizzled with his fuzzy bleached crew cut, is one of the team's three over-23-year-old players allowed under Olympic rules.</p>
        <p>He did not know some of the younger United States players, but has been impressed with forwards like Casey, from the University of Portland, Josh Wolff from the Chicago Fire and Chris Albright from D.C. United, both of Major League Soccer. These three young dudes put pressure on the Czechs all night, with Albright and Wolff both scoring.</p>
        <p>''The M.L.S. makes a huge difference,'' Friedel said after the game. ''This Czech team has lost something like two games in 17, and at times we played them right out of the park. Our team is so much better than in 1992. This proves that M.L.S. is developing good young players. Yet the European leagues will pay these Czech guys a lot of money. They should be taking some of the American players, too.''</p>
        <p>Friedel remembers the discrepancy in 1992. The United States opened against the Italian under-23 team, and he recalled: ''They've got guys playing in Serie A and I'm going back to U.C.L.A. to play San Diego State. It's different now. Our guys belong.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, the Americans, coached by Clive Charles, began moving the ball mostly on the left side and popping it in toward the large forward, Casey, the only college player on the squad.</p>
        <p>The approach paid off in the 21st minute when Wolff made a run down the left side and fired a cross in front of the goal. Casey slid and failed to touch the ball, but Albright slid in from the right and poked the ball into the net. The United States held the lead for seven minutes until Marek Jankulovski created a goal on his own. He dribbled into traffic, going right, faking Frankie Hejduk into an impromptu corkscrew, and then dribbling left and firing a left-footed shot that Friedel could not handle after his right foot slipped on the dewy grass.</p>
        <p>The Americans seemed recharged by the Czech goal and began playing openly again. In the 44th minute, a long booming punt by the keeper came back to haunt the Czechs when it was smartly rebounded upfield. Casey controlled it on the left side, sent a pass toward the goal that Wolff converted with his right foot for a 2-1 lead at halftime.</p>
        <p>Seven minutes into the second half, Chad McCarty, an American defender, was called for taking down Marek Heinz in the penalty area. Lukas Dosek converted the penalty kick for the final goal of the match.</p>
        <p>However, Friedel and Wolff nearly stunned the Czechs in the 64th minute when Friedel spotted Wolff on the fly and made a discus-thrower heave that put the ball in front of Wolff, who could not quite beat the goalkeeper.</p>
        <p>''He put it on a dime,'' Wolff said later. ''I just didn't control it with my foot.''</p>
        <p>Friedel, who has great hand skills from his basketball days in Ohio -- he could have been a walk-on at U.C.L.A. -- was proud of his long throw, as well as the tie. The last time the United States won its opening Olympic match was in 1984 in Los Angeles. The American team has never advanced to the semifinals.</p>
        <p>In the first game of the doubleheader before a packed house of 24,800 fans, Germany defeated Australia, 3-0, in a women's match. The American women, defending Olympic champions and 1999 Women's World Cup champions, make their debut in Melbourne on Thursday against Norway, the only nation to have a winning record against the United States.</p>
