        <p>SELVER-Paul. 60 years have flown by since you left us. A day doesn't go by when you're not in my thoughts. Your spirit to make our world a better place is now in the hearts of your grandson Paul and grandaughter Elsbeth. You would enjoy your great-grandchildren, Jesse, Eden and Adamteenagers who are ready to conquer the world. Max and Katlyn our 11 year old twins are a delight. I do regret you're not with us, however I am here to represent you so that you are not forgotten. With love your son, Ren</p>
