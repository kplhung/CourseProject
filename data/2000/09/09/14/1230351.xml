        <p>Visitors to Philadelphia Museum of Art's exhibition on the 17th-century Japanese artist Hon'ami Koetsu can get a tactile experience of two of his works, a ceramic tea bowl and a 27-foot-long painted scroll, by means of reproductions that are connected to a computer system that shows corresponding images of the original; photo (M)</p>

        <p>MOST of the ceramics, lacquer ware and hand scrolls by the 17th-century Japanese artist Hon'ami Koetsu on display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art are protected under heavy glass and dim lighting. But two fragile items have been digitally recreated to allow museum visitors to experience them as the artist intended: by handling them.</p>
        <p>The two reproductions -- of a ceramic tea bowl and a 27-foot-long painted scroll, are the result of a three-year project of the staff and students at the International Academy of Media Arts and Sciences, in Gifu, Japan. In both cases, a reproduction of the object, which the user handles, is connected to a computer system that shows corresponding images of the original.</p>
        <p>''The idea was not to make just a replica but to give a sense of what it is like to hold a tea bowl, or turn the scroll,'' said Felice Fischer, curator of Japanese/East Asian Art at the musuem, where the Koetsu exhibition is running until Oct. 29.</p>
        <p>''It's an attempt to bring these static  items to life and to show their use to an audience that is totally unfamiliar with Japanese art.''</p>
        <p>Using technology to incorporate a tactile experience into the exhibition was important, Ms. Fischer said, because of the way such objects were used in 16th- and 17th-century Japan. During tea ceremonies and poetry readings, tea bowls and hand scrolls were passed around or read among small groups of friends.</p>
        <p>''They were luxury items, for special occasions, but meant to be used,'' Ms. Fischer said.</p>
        <p>To recreate the original black Shichiri (''seven seas'') tea bowl, a CAT scan was taken of it, which allowed the academy staff and students in Japan to obtain precise information about the clay's density and air pockets, and the subtle gradations in Koetsu's pottery. (Like most artists during that time, Koetsu did not use a potter's wheel, but molded his bowls by hand.) From the CAT scan, the academy team produced an exact model of the bowl made of hardened resin.</p>
        <p>The exhibit uses a motion-tracking system developed by Polhemus, based in Colchester, Vt. The resin bowl sits on a platform with a flat-panel computer screen behind it. The bowl is tethered by a cord containing a small receiver, with a transmitter underneath the platform that creates an electromagnetic field.</p>
        <p>The system tracks the position and orientation of the receiver as the resin bowl is picked up and handled, sending the data to a PC, which uses graphics software to synchronize the replica's movement with a three-dimensional rendering of the real bowl on the screen.</p>
        <p>If the clear resin bowl is turned upside down, for example, the computer screen will show an image of the original bowl turning upside down as well.</p>
        <p>Although the resin bowl is clear and the original is black with brown spots, the handlers get a sense of the exact shape and weight of the bowl, and they can touch the characteristic smooth insides, which were thought to be necessary for whisking the fine tea powder.</p>
        <p>And although they can't feel the heat from a cup of tea, they can feel how Koetsu made the bottom of the bowl thicker, so as to warm the hands of the drinker without burning them.</p>
        <p>The handscroll exhibit is a reproduction of Koetsu's Crane Scroll, which he collaborated on with another Japanese artist, Tawaraya Sotatsu. (Sotatsu painted streaming motifs of cranes on the scroll, while Koetsu wrote 36 Japanese poems on top of the artwork, in calligraphy.)</p>
        <p>The scroll was constructed much like the original, with dowels on both ends and paper that is similar in quality to the original. The paper, however, is blank, sits underneath a sheet of glass and acts as a display screen for images from the original scroll from a projector underneath it, which is connected to a PowerMac G4.</p>
        <p>The scroll's dowels contain sensors that detect the user's scrolling motions, which are sent to the computer, so that when the scroll is turned, the corresponding verse and images are projected onto the paper.</p>
        <p>Pressing a button on the glass causes the projector to show only the calligraphy or only the cranes. The cranes alone can appear to be either a group of cranes on the sheet, or the flight path of a single crane, an effect that resembles modern-day animation techniques, Ms. Fisher said.</p>
        <p>The Crane Scroll exhibit also plays the chanted versions of the poems. The oral chants are synchronized with the scroll sensors to stop and start as the scroll is turned.</p>
        <p>The original tea bowl, on loan from a Tokyo museum, is on display in an adjacent gallery at the museum, and the original Crane Scroll, lent by the Kyoto National Museum, will be added to the exhibit on Sept. 19.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fisher said she had been pleasantly surprised at the level of care museum visitors were taking with the exhibit.</p>
        <p>''Technology can be a useful tool, but sometimes it's tricky because images on a screen can turn an exhibit into a toy or game,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''But we think this works because you're handling the objects rather than only pushing buttons or a mouse.''</p>
