        <p>In a sign that voters in Vermont remain divided over the state's new civil union law,  five Republican state legislators who supported the gay-rights law were defeated in Tuesday's primary,  while four other Republicans and one Democrat who backed the law won.</p>
        <p>The primary was largely seen as a referendum on civil unions, with many challengers campaigning on the issue. Earlier this year, the Legislature enacted the nation's first law granting same-sex couples many of the benefits and protections of marriage. At the time, some Vermonters threatened to vote against legislators who backed the law.</p>

        <p>In a sign that voters in Vermont remain divided over the state's new civil union law,  five Republican state legislators who supported the gay-rights law were defeated in Tuesday's primary,  while four other Republicans and one Democrat who backed the law won.</p>
        <p>The primary was largely seen as a referendum on civil unions, with many challengers campaigning on the issue. Earlier this year, the Legislature enacted the nation's first law granting same-sex couples many of the benefits and protections of marriage. At the time, some Vermonters threatened to vote against legislators who backed the law.</p>
        <p>State Representative Marion Milne, a Republican who voted for the law, lost to Sylvia Kennedy, who was opposed to it.</p>
        <p>But State Representative Thomas Little, a Republican who led the House Judiciary Committee in writing the law beat his challenger.</p>
        <p>Ed Flanagan, the state auditor,  defeated State Senator Jan Backus in the Democratic primary for United States Senate. Mr. Flanagan will challenge Senator James M. Jeffords, a Republican. Mr. Flanagan is the first openly gay candidate to win a major party nomination for the United States Senate, according to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, which seeks to increase the number of openly gay public officials. Both Mr. Flanagan and Mr. Backus supported the civil-unions law.</p>
