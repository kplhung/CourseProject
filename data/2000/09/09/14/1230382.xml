        <p>AUTUMN is nigh, and as lazy days at the beach soon give way to busy afternoons raking leaves, the air positively quivers with the promise of blazing jack-o'-lanterns, roasting turkeys and billions of dollars worth of advertisements peddling cars and trucks.</p>
        <p>(What, you were expecting a paean to the changing seasons? Perhaps next week, on the editorial page.)</p>
        <p>For the 2001 model year, which formally begins Oct. 1, automakers will eagerly try to gain attention in an American market more cluttered than ever, their efforts complicated by uncertainties ranging from gasoline prices to interest rates.</p>
        <p>''It's incredibly difficult'' to stand out, said Adrian Barrow, account planning director at Team One Advertising in El Segundo, Calif., a unit of the Publicis Groupe S.A. that will introduce tonight a campaign for the 2001 models of the Lexus LS 430 imported luxury sedan.</p>
        <p>''If I see another silver car driving down a twisty road,'' he added, laughing, 'I'm going to gag.''</p>
        <p>To keep consumers from doing just that, agencies like Team One are scrambling to find compelling ways to sell vehicles.</p>
        <p>''Good advertising is all about nuances,'' said Mark-Hans Richer, director of advertising and sales promotion for the GMC line of trucks and sport utility vehicles made by General Motors.</p>
        <p>''GMC is a strong brand for some people,'' he added. ''We needed it to be stronger for more people.''</p>
        <p>So in a $30 million campaign scheduled to begin on Sept. 22 by the New York office of Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, a description of GMC products as ''professional grade'' -- appearing in some ads since 1998 -- is being broadened to include all models, from the Sierra and Yukon to the Envoy. ''We are professional grade'' is the theme of the campaign, which features GMC engineers involved in the creation and production of the '01 models.</p>
        <p>''Everyone can appreciate a well-engineered vehicle, whether you're pulling a horse trailer or taking landscaping home from Home Depot,'' said Susan Cantor, executive vice president and managing director at Lowe Lintas, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>''In research, we discovered all consumers shared one mind-set: 'I'm smart, I'm in the know. And I want to do business with a company equally in the know,' '' she added. ''So we're going to give them the salient product points they need to buy a truck or S.U.V.''</p>
        <p>Contrasted to that practical, detailed approach is the more ethereal tack taken by the estimated $25 million campaign by Team One for the LS 430, formerly known as the LS 400. Its ads carry the theme ''Imagine how you'll feel driving,'' which is dramatized with exuberant images ranging from a Roman piazza filled with dancing couples to a Tuscan countryside populated by singers warbling along with the Dinah Shore pop tune ''Shoo Fly Pie and Apple Pan Dowdy.''</p>
        <p>''It's a romantic exaggeration, so to speak, an illustration of the emotional experience of driving the car, the third generation of our flagship model,'' said Greg Kitzens, corporate marketing manager for the Lexus division of Toyota Motor Sales USA in Torrance, Calif.</p>
        <p>''We have been known more for the rational features of our cars,'' he added. ''As we're introducing more stylish vehicles with more luxury and more performance, we're seeking a little more passion, a little more emotion, for our brand.''</p>
        <p>To underscore that goal, the LS 430 campaign also begins a revised  theme for the Lexus division. ''The passionate pursuit of perfection'' will replace ''The relentless pursuit of perfection.''</p>
        <p>As for Dinah Shore's fame for years of singing the ''See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet'' jingle, Mr. Kitzens said with a chuckle, ''We hope 'Shoo Fly Pie' will be as catchy.''</p>
        <p>Catchy also describes a campaign with a budget of more than $20 million that is to begin tomorrow for the redesigned C-Class line of cars sold by the Mercedes-Benz unit of DaimlerChrysler. The campaign, focused on catching drivers in their 30's and 40's rather than the more typical C-Class buyers in their 50's and 60's, carries this theme: ''The new C. Live. A lot.''</p>
        <p>The television, print, Internet and promotional campaign continues the more playful tone that has typified Mercedes-Benz advertising since 1995. In one TV spot, stylishly dressed people produce cartoon-style exaggerated responses when a C-Class car passes. Their eyes bulge out of their heads, steam pours from their ears and they float above the pavement in vignettes that seem to have been a result of the unlikely collaboration of Richard Avedon and Tex Avery.</p>
        <p>''We want to reach and connect with'' younger consumers who ''we acknowledge live life a little differently,'' said Alex Gellert, partner at the Mercedes agency, Merkley Newman Harty in New York, part of the Omnicom Group. That is reflected in the line at the end of many of the ads for the C-Class, the lowest-priced Mercedes sold in this country: ''And by all means, whatever you do, drive a cool car.''</p>
        <p>But if you're really cool, would you say you're cool?</p>
