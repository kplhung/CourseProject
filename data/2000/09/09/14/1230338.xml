        <p>Some froth is simply more durable than other froth. The Pearl Theater Company, in a production so reverent to the published text that it is almost a genuflection, is demonstrating that after 60 years Noel Coward's ''Blithe Spirit'' still arouses steady waves of gentle laughter right through its two and a half hours, and it is hard to say why. Some lines are witty, but on the whole the dialogue is not Coward's most sparkling. He boasted that he wrote it in less than a week, and it reads that way.</p>
        <p>The plot will not survive logical reflection. And countless films and television shows have exploited the play's use of mischievous but mostly harmless ghosts for decades. Yet in performance it remains so unpretentiously charming and lively, you half suspect it could fill a house for as long as a producer would let it run.</p>

        <p>Some froth is simply more durable than other froth. The Pearl Theater Company, in a production so reverent to the published text that it is almost a genuflection, is demonstrating that after 60 years Noel Coward's ''Blithe Spirit'' still arouses steady waves of gentle laughter right through its two and a half hours, and it is hard to say why. Some lines are witty, but on the whole the dialogue is not Coward's most sparkling. He boasted that he wrote it in less than a week, and it reads that way.</p>
        <p>The plot will not survive logical reflection. And countless films and television shows have exploited the play's use of mischievous but mostly harmless ghosts for decades. Yet in performance it remains so unpretentiously charming and lively, you half suspect it could fill a house for as long as a producer would let it run.</p>
        <p>For actors it must be a grand temptation and an intimidating challenge. Most people now know it not in performance or as a book but in the 1945 film adaptation by David Lean that turns up with satisfying regularity on cable channels; with Rex Harrison as the writer, Constance Cummings as his wife, Kay Hammond as the ghost of the first wife and Margaret Rutherford as the medium, it remains a model of brilliant translation from stage to screen, and the acting is superb.</p>
        <p>The Pearl's version, directed by Stephen Hollis, meets the challenge confidently. This is a seasoned cast -- five of the seven actors have serious Broadway experience -- and one is not tempted to make comparisons that might seem irresistible. Harry Feiner's set and Stephen Petrilli's lighting suggest transparency in a way that might be inspired by old films and that make it seem natural for ghosts to be popping in and out of rooms in a country house.</p>
        <p>If there is a shaky moment, it is in the first scene, when the youngest cast member, Elizabeth Ureneck, as Edith, is evidently told to go about the maid's duties in a series of 100-yard sprints. Of course the dialogue is full of amusing asides about Edith's eagerness, but Mr. Hollis misses a fine opportunity to demonstrate how much funnier the talk could be if the action did not compete with it.</p>
        <p>Dominic Cuskern and Glynis Bell handle the Bradmans, roles that can so easily distract from the air of assumed innocence the play floats on, with the lightness of ballroom dancers: he the somewhat vacant doctor who likes his gin and she the wife who, for all her distant formality, is a shrewd judge of when someone is about to go berserk.</p>
        <p>Hope Chernov's Elvira is an alluring ghost who manages to make her decidedly homicidal instinct seem the innocent idiosyncrasy of a somewhat spoiled beauty who knows her worth. Her scheme to make eternity more interesting by stealing her husband from his second wife (i.e., killing him) seems as perfectly sensible in Ms. Chernov's amusingly preoccupied presentation of this character as does her passion for being driven around in automobiles at a tiny fraction of the speed she can manage as a spirit on her own. And when Elvira accidentally bags the second wife rather than her husband, she looks no more troubled than if she had dropped a stitch in her knitting.</p>
        <p>As for dramatic development, there would not be any without the transformations of Ruth (Joanne Camp) and Charles (Doug Stender). The director and Mr. Stender have the good sense to let us know little by little that the urbane Charles is not a very nice man, especially not at the end, when he gleefully realizes that in this uneven battle of the sexes he is free of both wives and can escape into a life in which he need never give a thought to anyone else.</p>
        <p>Ruth's role is much tougher since the audience has to feel the change that comes over her more than hear it; Ms. Camp knows how to make her emotions brush your cheek and whisper to you. That the worldly woman of the first act has been wounded in the second by the knowledge that her husband is flirting with his dead first wife seems an admission dragged out of her, and her serenity when she herself is a spirit has the warmth of an earned triumph.</p>
        <p>As it should in any good performance, of course, the evening belongs to Madame Arcati, the medium Ruth and Charles invite to dinner as unwitting entertainment but who turns their world inside out. The trick here is to make this character an amusing eccentric but not a comic, and Delphi Harrington has a sure sense of the difference. Her Madame Arcati is dotty, to be sure, but it is only gradually that you realize what sounds like scatterbrained chatter is really a sign that she is the most confident person in the play: she cheerfully admits mistakes and pushes on to find formulas, magic or otherwise, that will work. She is as inevitable as nature, and much more so than eternity.</p>
        <p>By the end there is little doubt that Coward meant her to be the only person in the story who was entirely sane throughout since she alone avoided taking anything too seriously: Q.E.D.</p>
        <p>BLITHE SPIRIT</p>
        <p>By Noel Coward; directed by Stephen Hollis; stage manager, Lisa Ledwich; sets by Harry Feiner; costumes by Leslie Yarmo; lighting by Stephen Petrilli; sound by Johnna Doty; technical director, Tony Rust. Presented by the Pearl Theater Company. At 80 St. Mark's Place, East Village.</p>
