        <p>The immediate verdict by investors on the decision by Chase Manhattan to take over J. P. Morgan was a resounding hiss; Chase's share price fell 11 percent the last two days, after rumors of the deal began to spread.</p>
        <p>There are good reasons for such a reaction: Chase is paying a hefty premium over market value, and financial services mergers often run into problems of integration that result in some of the most valuable people leaving. Plans to cut costs sometimes backfire, as it turns out that the people being let go really were valuable to the organization.</p>
        <p>Chase's stock has been a good performer in recent years, but it is now trading around 12 times its trailing earnings. Morgan, whose stock had done less well until recently, is trading at 16 times earnings.</p>
        <p>Since this is a stock swap, with each Morgan share exchanged for 3.7 Chase shares, it is simple arithmetic that the merger will substantially dilute Chase's earnings -- unless there is synergy that raises revenue while allowing costs to be reduced. That is precisely what William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive of Chase, who is to keep that role in the merged company, expects to happen. ''This is a global financial powerhouse,'' he told stock analysts yesterday. ''This is a situation, I am convinced, where one plus one will substantially exceed two.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison was expressing the current wisdom of many in the financial services industry when he said that there would be ''less than a handful of winners in the wholesale investment banking race.'' If that is true, then both Chase and Morgan had to do something, for separately their efforts to burst into the top tier of investment banking had met with limited success at best.</p>
        <p>Some outsiders think Chase can do it. ''The group of five becomes a group of six,'' said Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, an institutional research firm. By his count, the top five in worldwide finance are now Morgan Stanley Dean Witter; Goldman, Sachs; Merrill Lynch; Citigroup; and Credit Suisse. He sees Deutsche Bank and UBS on the edge.</p>
        <p>The theory is that size and scope matter, that companies want financial advisers with operations in all regions of the world, and capabilities in everything from corporate lending to mergers and stock underwriting. Chase and Morgan have individually had middling-to-poor success in breaking into some of these markets. (One joke that made the rounds yesterday was that the deal would certainly raise each bank's standing in mergers-and-acquisition tables, at least for one quarter. That is because Chase listed Chase as its financial adviser, and Morgan listed Morgan.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison set forth a plan by which Morgan's investment banking operations would benefit from access to Chase's individual and corporate customers. ''No firm will have a broader, deeper client relationship than this firm will have and that is very leverageable,'' he said. Morgan's chief, Douglas A. Warner III, was similarly enthusiastic, saying the combined operation would ''take our platform and drive it through Chase's much larger client base.''</p>
        <p>On the retail side, there is precedence. Such synergies appear to be working at Citigroup, the parent of Citibank, Travelers Insurance and Salomon Smith Barney. That combination was received with initial enthusiasm on Wall Street, followed by a lot of doubt -- not to mention by a bit of panic after the Russian default in 1998, and Citigroup's stock price suffered. But the stock has sharply rebounded amid indications that the merger is working.</p>
        <p>On the institutional side, the plan to sell more services to corporate customers depends heavily on two things: convincing them that the new Morgan Chase is a top-notch competitor and taking the business away from some highly regarded rivals who will be doing their best to keep it. Citigroup seems to have done that; it remains to be seen whether or not the new Chase can.</p>
        <p>Chase pledged to maintain its current annual dividend of $1.28 a share, a yield of 2.5 percent at current stock prices. Morgan shareholders will see their annual payout rise by nearly one-fifth.</p>
        <p>In the financial world these days, a low dividend is perversely a sign of investor confidence, indicating that share buyers expect growth to produce bountiful rewards without hefty dividend payments. Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch all have dividend yields of 1 percent or less. That the new Chase Morgan will pay more in dividends than the companies did independently may indicate that management is not confident investors will believe the merged company is leaping into the top rank.</p>
