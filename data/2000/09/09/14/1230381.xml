        <p>On the day that Palestinians had hoped to declare their state, some feuded among themselves instead, blocking intersections, burning tires and hurling stones at cars in the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>But the mini-uprising, reminiscent of those against Israel, had nothing to do with disappointment that this date, meant to be so significant, was to come and go without either peace or a state. Gazans are used to disappointment.</p>
        <p>Rather, the uproar grew out of a power struggle among members of the Fatah organization of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. Many Fatah loyalists now fill the ranks of Mr. Arafat's security forces, and they tend to be more loyal to their commander than to Fatah itself. This has caused tensions, and the latest one began as a petty dispute.</p>
        <p>The Gazan Accountants Association held elections last week, and Fatah emerged victorious. Fatah members gathered in the streets of Gaza City, shooting their weapons to celebrate. The police, who are also Fatah, were called. They arrested several of the celebrating accountants, and several others said that they had been roughed up.</p>
        <p>After that incident, both sides claimed the other had kidnapped some of its men. The rancor grew into today's rioting, which sent plumes of black smoke into the air and rocks flying at cars with the red license plates of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>In its account of the event, Fatah blamed everything on Moussa Arafat, the head of police intelligence, who many think is a divisive force. A leaflet warned him ''not to sink our society with his cheap internal battles,'' saying he would be ''the address of our next battle.''</p>
        <p>''We ask President Arafat,'' the leaflet said, ''to remove this cancer from our national body so we will be able to build our independent state with its capital in Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>Moussa Arafat could not be reached for comment. Other police and security officers noted that the forces acted with restraint today, letting the scene play itself out and not using their weapons to disperse the rioters.</p>
        <p>The episode distressed many Palestinians, who said they would have understood demonstrations against Israel or over the decision to delay statehood. ''But who the heck needs internal conflict on this date in particular?'' one Gazan journalist asked.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian Central Council voted last weekend to defer making a declaration of statehood today in order to give the peace effort another couple of months. Sept. 13 was chosen as the deadline because it was the date set by the most recent interim peace agreement for accomplishing a final peace treaty.</p>
        <p>The deadline for peace was also broken. But talks, which are deadlocked over the seemingly intractable issue of Jerusalem's status, are to begin again on Thursday in Washington, where senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will meet with American mediators, according to Israeli television. Discussion on the issues are expected to pick up where they left off at Camp David in July, although both sides fear that there has been backsliding from concessions on the table then.</p>
        <p>Anxious to give the peace effort more time, Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whose government is in a shambles, is working this week to build a minority center-left coalition of 50 members of Parliament. He is counting on the 10 Israeli Arab members of Parliament to support his peace moves from outside the coalition.</p>
        <p>But tensions are running high after a police crackdown on the Islamic Movement party and a move to shut down a quarry in Nazareth that employs many Arabs.</p>
