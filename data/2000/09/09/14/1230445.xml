        <p>Facing the most serious challenge to his leadership, Prime Minister Tony Blair called on protesters tonight to lift their virtual siege of oil refineries and storage depots, saying their actions were paralyzing the country and endangering lives.</p>
        <p>After a second day of emergency meetings at 10 Downing Street aimed at easing blockades that have left 90 percent of the country's filling stations dry, Mr. Blair grimly told a news conference that despite the pledge he had made on Tuesday of showing progress within 24 hours, the situation had only worsened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair, by refusing to accede to the protesters' demands to cut fuel taxes, has increasingly become the target of the protesters, and tonight he upped the stakes by angrily denouncing the demonstrations.</p>
        <p>''As a result of these blockades and this intimidation, real damage is now being done to real people,'' he said. Doctors, nurses, police officers and firefighters are having problems getting to their jobs and ''lives are at risk if those people can't get to work,'' he added.</p>
        <p>He also reiterated his determination to resist pleas for a sudden cut in fuel taxes, which are the highest in Europe. ''Whatever the protesters' feelings,'' he said, ''and I repeat that I understand the real difficulties people have over the high price of petrol, it cannot be right to force a change in policy by these means.'' Any government that did, he added, would lose all credibility.</p>
        <p>Although both businesses and labor unions have called for an end to the protests, the opposition Tories today joined in the attacks on Mr. Blair. Michael Ancram, chairman of the Conservative Party, scorned Mr. Blair's characterization of the picketers as ''an insult to the many decent, law-abiding people conducting lawful protests.''</p>
        <p>Asserting that the real problem was ''a prime minister in panic,'' Mr. Ancram said: ''Last night Tony Blair confidently strode into a press conference and said, 'Give me 24 hours and I'll solve the fuel crisis.' Twenty-four hours later, he skulked back into the same room and admitted the crisis had got far worse.''</p>
        <p>Oil trucks resumed limited deliveries today, but the flow was estimated to be less than 15 percent of normal volume. Almost all of it was designated for the police, fire departments, hospitals and ambulances, rather than the nation's gas pumps.</p>
        <p>The Petrol Retailers Association warned that it could be three weeks before Britain was back to normal.</p>
        <p>The protests intensified today across the country, with pickets monitoring the rigs leaving oil company properties and creeping convoys of truckers creating miles of traffic jams. At some refineries, drivers refused to take on oil either out of sympathy with the protesters or in fear at possible retaliation from them.</p>
        <p>The protests, which caught the Blair government off guard, have been mounted by truck owners, farmers and self-employed workers claiming that rising fuel prices -- gasoline costs about $4.37 a gallon -- are putting them out of business. Supermarkets reported empty shelves from panic buying, the Royal Mail said it could not guarantee deliveries, banks said they were short of cash and many schools closed because they had no bus service.</p>
        <p>The National Health Service was put on ''red alert'' -- in which it is supposed to prepare for treating only emergency cases -- and the Ministry of Defense tonight deployed 80 oil trucks at strategic points around the country to deliver fuel for emergency services.</p>
        <p>But despite the severe inconveniences, the protests continued to attract substantial sympathy from the public and to focus anger on the government.</p>
        <p>''I heard Blair say he wouldn't cave in to the protesters, but he should know that 90 percent of the public are with them, not him,'' said Dave Cummings, a taxi driver in Edinburgh who said he backed the movement even though he had only a half tank of gas left this morning and no likelihood of a refill. ''Here we have all this oil in the North Sea, and we're paying the highest petrol prices in the world.''</p>
        <p>One of the main reasons why gasoline is so expensive here is the 76.2 percent tax on gasoline, about triple the rate in the United States.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Blair made his high-risk pledge to get the fuel situation ''on the way back to normal'' within 24 hours, protesters reacted with defiance of their own.</p>
        <p>''Tony Blair said last night this will all be over in 24 hours, and we want to ram those words down his throat,'' said Julie Charles, a truck owner from Yeovil, Somerset, in the southwest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair is determined to appear decisive, aware of the power of popular protest in Britain to bring down governments. A so-called winter of discontent in 1979 began the fall of the Labor administration of Prime Minister James Callaghan, who was perceived as failing to get a grip on the wave of strikes that brought Britain to its knees. ''We are all bound by history,'' Education Secretary David Blunkett said pointedly today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair summoned oil company executives this morning to a second blunt-spoken session in Downing Street, and the executives emerged saying they would do everything they could to resume normal deliveries.</p>
        <p>They had argued that they were unwilling to order drivers to make shipments because of fear for their safety. ''We will be stepping this up as soon as possible to get back to normal, '' said Shell Oil's chief executive, Malcolm Brinder, reading from a joint statement after the meeting.</p>
        <p>The protests were largely incident-free until today, when the police were ordered to clear routes for oil trucks and arrested some demonstrators.</p>
        <p>Sir John Evans, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said he had received reports of intimidation and was offering to put constables in the cabs of trucks if necessary.</p>
        <p>Both business and labor groups condemned the protests and called for their immediate end.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Trades Union Congress said the demonstrations were an unlawful attempt to bully the government. ''They must not succeed,'' the statement said. ''The blockades are not a legitimate form of industrial action but a challenge to democracy and crude attempt to hold the country to ransom.''</p>
        <p>The British Chambers of Commerce and the Confederation of British Industry warned that many businesses were being hurt and said that while they sympathized with the pleas for lower taxes, the government must not give in to the protesters.</p>
        <p>''The prime minister's promise to get fuel flowing from depots must be delivered rapidly, using whatever means are available,'' said Chris Humphries, the director general of the chambers.</p>
        <p>Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, who brought the taxes to their current level, said, ''We will not fall for the quick fix and the irresponsible short-termism of making tax policy this afternoon because of blockades this morning.''</p>
        <p>He said the increased revenues were being used for much needed investment in hospitals and schools and in transportation and public services. He also argued that while Britain had higher fuel taxes than its European neighbors, it enjoyed lower rates of income tax and business taxes.</p>
        <p>The Conservative Party leader, William Hague, said, ''The whole country has now paid the price for having an arrogant out-of-touch government.''</p>
        <p>He refused however, to endorse an immediate reduction in the gasoline tax, saying only that if the Tories returned to power, it would be a ''strong candidate'' for a cut.</p>
        <p>The Tories' unease may stem from the fact that when they were in government, they introduced a ''fuel-duty escalator'' that committed the Treasury to raise the tax on gasoline and diesel annually above the inflation rate. Though it was put forward as a means of encouraging conservation, it became notorious with motorists, and Mr. Brown ended the escalator in March.</p>
        <p>Overall taxes on fuel have continued to rise, however, and Mr. Brown failed to anticipate the anger they would draw from consumers as crude oil prices also rose. What is a current windfall for the Treasury could become a liability for Labor as it prepares for a national election expected in May.</p>
        <p>Peter Riddell, the chief political writer of The Times of London, predicted, however, that a tough response from Mr. Blair would limit any electoral damage. ''This is a test of the government's will,'' he said, ''not of its political future.''</p>
