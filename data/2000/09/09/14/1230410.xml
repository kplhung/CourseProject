        <p>As his allies worked to make the most of Gov. George W. Bush's campaign troubles, Vice President Al Gore went about the hard work of not making news today, manufacturing gauzy pictures in a Maine high school and re-emphasizing policy positions that seem to be touching a chord.</p>
        <p>To the extent possible, Mr. Gore and his aides have no desire to distract attention from the recent streak of unfavorable stories about the Bush campaign. Their strategy is essentially to run out the clock during this stage of the campaign, letting Mr. Bush struggle on his own.</p>
        <p>Then the Gore campaign plans to turn its full attention to debates with Mr. Bush, which will be the subject of a critical meeting between the campaigns on Thursday, and to battling the better-financed Republicans on the airwaves.</p>
        <p>And so today, Mr. Gore came to Lewiston High School in southern Maine, where he devoted most of the day to a series of photo-friendly encounters that conveyed his concern about education. As he did so, his aides drew attention to a letter written by two Democratic senators asking the Federal Communications Commission to investigate a Republican television commercial that, they asserted, may have violated a 1974 federal rule against subliminal advertising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said nothing on that topic today, leaving the task to Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana. The senators wrote the F.C.C. to express their concern about a Republican National Committee advertisement that fleetingly shows the word ''rats'' in a single frame.</p>
        <p>David Fiske, a spokesman for the commission, said that the request would be studied but that the commission had the authority to sanction only stations that knowingly broadcast an illegal advertisement, not the political strategists who produced it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore flew from Maine to Boston this afternoon for a rally with his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, and a fund-raiser that was expected to collect close to $2 million for the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>But the day's primary imagery came from the Gore campaign's eight-hour occupation of Lewiston High. Throughout the day, Secret Service agents patrolled the corridors along with hall monitors, and bomb-sniffing dogs examined students' backpacks. Mr. Gore's speeches were repeatedly interrupted by intercom announcements from the principal's office, and the vice president sampled school cafeteria cuisine, downing two cheeseburgers and some french fries.</p>
        <p>It was the seventh ''school day'' of Mr. Gore's campaign. As always, he spent the night before at the home of teachers, in this case Donald and Susan Jalbert, both of whom teach at the school. Mr. Gore arrived about 1 a.m., stayed up talking with the Jalberts and their two children until 2, and then rose at 6:15 a.m. to eat the blueberry scones that Mrs. Jalbert had been baking since 4:30.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was spent in a succession of meetings -- with parents, school counselors, teachers and students. He provided research help to the juniors in Joan M. Macri's American history class as they scanned textbooks and Internet sites for the answers to questions about the Constitution. He instructed Seth Morin, a 16-year-old junior, how to find an Elvis Presley letter to President Richard M. Nixon on the National Archives Web site.</p>
        <p>All the while, cameras recorded the scenes. If there was a slip in the stagecraft, it was only that Mr. Gore, in his meeting with teachers, allowed himself to be photographed while seated beneath a picture labeled ''prehistoric man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore devoted a midday session with students and teachers in the library to promoting his plans for making college more affordable.</p>
        <p>''Coming out of high school, kids in middle-class families are under a lot of pressure, and their parents are under a lot of pressure,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Many of them have no idea where they're going to get the money to pay tuition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's proposals include increasing an existing federal tax deduction so that families could deduct 28 percent of annual tuition payments -- up to $10,000 in tuition for each child -- instead of the current 20 percent.</p>
        <p>That proposal has been criticized by the Bush campaign because it would only assist those who pay taxes, and would thus exclude many low-income families. Mr. Gore's aides said that those families are already eligible for a variety of federal college grants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would also create savings accounts that would allow parents to make pre-tax contributions that would be matched by the federal government and could be withdrawn without penalty to pay for college tuition. And he would create new tax-free accounts, similar to 401(k) accounts, that would permit individuals and their employers to put money away for adult learning and training.</p>
