        <p>The longer defenseman Scott Niedermayer stays out of training camp as an unsigned restricted free agent, the better the chances for several candidates to earn a job with the Devils.</p>
        <p>The loss of Vladimir Malakhov to free agency and the trade of Brad Bombardir left at least two openings on defense. The rookies Willie Mitchell and Sasha Goc are the front-runners for the spots, along with the veteran Ken Sutton.</p>
        <p>Coach Larry Robinson said after yesterday's practice at the team's training facility in West Orange, N.J., that he would most likely go with seven defensemen early in the season. Scott Stevens, Ken Daneyko, Brian Rafalski and Colin White are assured jobs. But if Niedermayer stays out for an extended period, the Devils may have to reach deeper into their roster.</p>
        <p>Two defensemen who have made an impression on the coaches are Darryl Andrews and Josef Boumedienne. But Mikko Jokela is one defenseman who will not be with the Devils. The 20-year-old Jokela was returned to his native Finland yesterday to play there this season. Goaltender Ari Ahonen, who is 19, was also returned to Finland.</p>
        <p>The Devils open the exhibition season against Pittsburgh at Wilkes-Barre, Pa., on Saturday and play at Detroit on Sunday.</p>
