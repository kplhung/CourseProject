        <p>LEATHER furniture and home accessories can be as comfortable as a pair of old leather gloves. Yet leather is also durable. ''Leather has an old-rich look that only gets more beautiful with age,'' said Teddy Edelman, an owner of Edelman Leather in New Milford, Conn. The look is classic, and good leather properly cared for will last a lifetime. How do you care for leather properly? Clean it gingerly with very little saddle soap, Murphy's Oil Soap or a solution of water and mild soap powder like Ivory Snow, said Mary Ellen Pinkham, author of Mary Ellen's Complete Home Reference Book (Crown, 1994). Never, she said, use detergent or wax.</p>
