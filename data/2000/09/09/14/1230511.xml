        <p>MANHATTAN: DEMOCRATS BURGLARIZED  Three laptop computers and a personal organzier were stolen from the Democratic National Committee's finance office in New York City early yesterday, the police said. The office, at 2 Penn Plaza, was broken into sometime between 4 and 8 a.m., said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman. ''It doesn't appear that they were targeted due to the fact that it was the Democratic National Committee,'' he said. ''It was just a crime of opportunity.'' The computers taken were those closest to the door.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: DORISMOND FAMILY FILES SUIT  The family of Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed security guard shot to death during a confrontation with the police, filed a $300 million suit yesterday in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. The family's lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, pictured at left with Mr. Dorismond's mother, called the March 16 shooting, initiated when an undercover narcotics detective tried to buy drugs from Mr. Dorismond, the ''ultimate case'' of racial profiling. The suit claims that Mr. Dorismond's rights were violated before his death and afterward, when his juvenile records were released and his apartment illegally searched. A grand jury declined to indict the detective who fired the fatal shot.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: 9-YEAR-OLDS CHARGED IN GROPING  Two 9-year-old boys were arrested at their Manhattan school yesterday and accused of groping a 9-year-old girl there, the police said. The authorities said the incident took place at 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday, in a first-floor stairwell of Public School 153, at 1750 Amsterdam Avenue. The suspects' names were not released because of their age.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SERVICE CONTRACT SETTLED  Building service workers ended a two-month strike at three Manhattan apartment buildings yesterday after their employer accepted the same contract accepted by 3,000 other New York apartment buildings in April. The workers walked out after the manager of the three buildings -- 150 East 18th Street, 50 East 78th Street, and 360 West 55th Street -- cut their pay to $8.50 an hour. Under the new contract, the workers, members of Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union, will receive $15.47 an hour and health and pension benefits.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: STABBING SUSPECT SOUGHT  The police have offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Bableu Hassan, a 19-year-old man who they say fatally stabbed his ex-girlfriend and slashed her 5-year-old daughter in the woman's Crown Heights apartment. Lt. John A. Cornicello, commander of the 77th Precinct detective squad, said that Mr. Hassan stabbed Chastity Adams, 24, four times on July 27, then slashed the child as she tried to help her mother. The child recovered after receiving nearly 100 stitches in her abdomen.</p>

        <p>BALDWIN: MAN SHOT DURING BREAK-IN  The police said several men invaded a house yesterday and shot an occupant in the head. The victim, Timothy Maxwell, 22, was awakened at 10:40 a.m. by a knock at the door of his family's house in Baldwin, according to Detective Sgt. Daniel Severin of the Nassau County Homicide Squad. When Mr. Maxwell opened the door, Sgt. Severin said, three or four people pushed their way in and one of them shot him in the head, then fled. Mr. Maxwell was taken to Nassau County Medical Center, where he was listed in extremely critical condition.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: BILL TO LIMIT TRUCK PARKING  In a proposal to reduce the ''tsunami-like tide of congestion,'' the City Council minority leader, Thomas V. Ognibene, introduced a bill yesterday to ban parking by buses, trucks, vans and other large vehicles within 15 feet of street corners. Mr. Ognibene, one of five Republicans on the 51-member Council, said the measure, which would exempt emergency vehicles, would give motorists better visibility at corners.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>NEWARK: WORK BEGINS ON RESEARCH CENTER  After eight years of planning, construction has begun on a 190,000-square-foot research center hailed yesterday by Mayor Sharpe James as ''another major step in Newark's renaissance.'' The center, to be completed in the fall of 2001, will house the Public Health Research Institute, which is moving from Manhattan, and branches of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. It will be part of a planned 50-acre complex that will eventually include 125 single- and two-family houses and a science high school.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: SEVENTH DEATH LINKED TO DOCTORS  A seventh patient's death has been linked to a controversial drug-detoxification procedure used by two doctors who are facing the loss of their licenses. The doctors, Lance Gooberman and David Bradway, have been barred since last Oct. 13 from performing the procedure, known as ultra- rapid opiate detoxification, outside a hospital. They claim to have successfully helped more than 2,000 addicts get drugs out of their systems by sedating them with anesthesia in their Merchantville office, injecting medications to accelerate and ease withdrawal symptoms, then sending them home the same day.</p>

        <p>NEWARK: NO TRANSIT FARE INCREASES  New Jersey Transit yesterday adopted a 2001 budget that avoids bus and train fare increases for the 10th consecutive year. The agency's board also voted to buy 1,244 buses and 24 electric locomotives to replace aging equipment. The $1.036 billion budget represents an increase of 9.4 percent over last year.  (AP)</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: STATE NAMES INVESTMENT CHIEF  The state treasurer appointed a California pension manager yesterday to the newly created position of chief investment officer, a step required under a law passed this year to reform the agency's investment practices. Thomas E. Flanigan will oversee nearly $22 billion in Connecticut's pension fund, said Treasurer Denise L. Nappier. The General Assembly passed the law after a corruption scandal involving former state Treasurer Paul Silvester, who pleaded guilty last September to federal racketeering and money laundering charges.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: DEATH PENALTY NOT SOUGHT  State prosecutors have said they will not seek the death penalty against a man charged with the 1998 kidnapping and murder of a 42-year-old woman who had been working part-time for an escort service. The defendant, Gregory McArthur, was held in lieu of $2 million bail after being extradited from Massachusetts, where he was serving a 10-year term for assault. He was charged in the death of Annemarie Cusano, the former wife of the guitarist Vincent Cusano of the rock group Kiss. Ms. Cusano, the mother of two teenage daughters, disappeared in January 1998 after meeting Mr. McArthur through the escort service.</p>
