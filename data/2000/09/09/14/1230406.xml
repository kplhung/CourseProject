        <p>Jason Priestley, the slouching star of ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' is not best known for his mastery of proper English diction. But in Italy his high school angst has been put to use to help Italians learn English. Computer users can freeze a frame on a CD-ROM version of the show and pause his mumbled delivery. If that doesn't help, students can click to a more precise, mid-Atlantic voice-over.</p>
        <p>Installments of ''MovieTalk,'' CD-ROM's that convert popular American television shows into interactive English lessons, are being given away free by the newsmagazine L'Espresso. The marketing strategy is intended to sell magazines by tapping into Italians' thirst to improve their English.</p>
        <p>English has become the lingua franca of the world, but among European countries Italy has one of the lowest rates of proficiency. Only 28 percent of Italians speak any English, according to a 1999 study by the European Commission, compared with 78 percent of the Dutch, 77 percent of Swedes and 41 percent of Germans. Even the prickly French have a higher percentage of English-speakers -- 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Italians' longstanding insistence on having foreign movies and television shows dubbed into Italian is an important reason, Furio Colombo, a columnist, wrote in the daily newspaper La Repubblica. He believes that the dubbing has lulled Italians into a false sense of security. ''Unconsciously, Italians have this idea that Italian is so universal a language that even Woody Allen speaks it fluently,'' Mr. Colombo said.</p>
        <p>In the last few years, however, Italians have scrambled to catch up, prompted by the Internet and a desire to compete in the global economy. Italy has more than 1,000 language schools, and many newspapers and magazines provide written English lessons and, increasingly, interactive lessons online.</p>
        <p>MovieTalk, a system designed by the American software company, Softrade International, has already been marketed in Germany and Japan using episodes of ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' ''Columbo,'' ''Murder, She Wrote,'' and ''Star Trek.'' Its debut here, however, is the latest Italian effort to gain proficiency without too much effort -- the linguistic equivalent of the electronic cellulite-jiggling devices that are demonstrated on quivering models on Italian cable television 24 hours a day.</p>
        <p>''If everybody who bought English-lesson tapes, CD-ROM's and books followed through all the way, we would by now be a bilingual nation,'' Marco Barina, marketing director of L'Espresso, said as he was preparing for the distribution of 700,000 cassettes of ''Columbo,'' the detective series starring Peter Falk. ''This at least allows people to be entertained while they learn.''</p>
        <p>Many Italians are beginning to express embarrassment over their poor grasp of English, particularly as Internet use spreads and English terms like ''killer,'' ''top model,'' ''downsizing'' and ''welfare'' seep into Italian newspapers and conversation.</p>
        <p>When the Democrats of the Left, the largest party in the governing center-left coalition, held their last convention, in January, they adopted the English words ''I Care'' as their slogan.</p>
        <p>Other Europeans improve their English by watching Hollywood movies with the original soundtrack, accompanied by subtitles. Most Italian movie theaters, however, show American films dubbed into Italian.</p>
        <p>Several companies in Italy now sell videocasettes of popular Hollywood movies like ''You've Got Mail'' and ''There's Something About Mary,'' with the original English-language soundtrack and also English-language subtitles, to help viewers follow the dialogue. Speak Up, a monthly magazine intended for Italian students of English, also sells videocasettes, along with transcripts from the film.</p>
        <p>The personal ads in Speak Up suggest that at least some readers cannot entirely accept Hollywood comedies as a serious language study guide, however. ''Desperately seeking videocasette of 'Sense and Sensibility' or other rigorously British films,'' a reader called Lina wrote recently.</p>
        <p>And some language instruction on the Internet includes a stern moral lesson. Stephen Murrell, an Englishman who runs the English Conversation Club, a language school in Genoa, supplies English courses to Donna Moderna magazine, Italy's highest circulation women's magazine, as well as the Donna Moderna Web site. Mr. Murrell, who also teaches English to Italians on cruise ships, composes his own texts to enhance vocabulary and reading comprehension, asking users to select the correct word from a list of five.</p>
        <p>One installment, ''Among the Slaves of the South in the States,'' luridly recounts plantation life during the American Civil War.</p>
        <p>One segment: ''A one-legged slave (grow, whip, surrender, hobbled, bent) by. 'Good morning, Master.' ''</p>
        <p>'' 'We had to cut off his leg to stop him escaping when he was younger,' smiled the plantation owner.''</p>
        <p>The text, which describes ''Negroes'' cheerfully picking cotton, might startle American readers, but Mr. Murrell, who noted that the editors had actually persuaded him to tone down his original language, said Italians needed to learn the painful parts of American -- and English -- history.</p>
        <p>''It's no good expecting students to read boring texts,'' he said. ''They have to read something they would read in their own language. We also do a lot of stuff on the English royal family. Italians love it.''</p>
