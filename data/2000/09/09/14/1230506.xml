        <p>Correction of Sept 11 article on new digital camera chip made by Foveon, regarding type of film cameras that it might be able to challenge</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Monday about a new digital camera chip made by Foveon misstated the type of film cameras that it might be able to challenge. Images made from the chip could one day be comparable to those made by so-called medium-format cameras, made by Hasselblad and others, which use film that is 6 by 6 centimeters. The chip images are not comparable to those made from film that is 4 by 5 inches, which produces a higher resolution. Hasselblad does not make a 4-by-5 camera.</p>
