        <p>In pursuit of profitability, StarMedia Network said yesterday that it planned to cut 125 jobs, or 15 percent of its staff, and take a one-time charge of $2 million to $4 million in the third quarter of this year. StarMedia, a New York-based company that aims at Spanish-  and Portuguese-speaking audiences around the world, said the job cuts were expected to save the company $15 million to $20 million in 2001, helping it to record a profit in the fourth quarter of 2001, a year earlier than expected. StarMedia's stock fell 50 cents, or 4 percent, to $11.50.</p>
