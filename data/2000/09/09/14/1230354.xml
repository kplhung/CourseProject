        <p>IN a building near Union Square, the co-op board had absolutely no problem approving a couple's plan to combine their old apartment with the one they had bought on the floor below.</p>
        <p>There was only one caveat: they couldn't use power tools.</p>
        <p>''What were they supposed to use -- a chisel to make the staircase?'' asked one neighbor, who like most of the people interviewed for this article withheld her name for fear of alienating her fellow shareholders.</p>
        <p>In a postwar building on Park Avenue, a homeowner recounted another tale of renovation woe. The co-op board first approved her plan to expand her kitchen in a terrace enclosure similar to her neighbors'. Then, while she was securing the permits, new board members vetoed the project. After agonizing negotiations, she ended up paying tens of thousands of dollars to the building's reserve fund to gain the board's permission. She has been waiting a year to move in.</p>
        <p>''If I knew what I know now,'' the woman said, ''I would have never bought this apartment. I would have found an apartment that didn't need work, and paid more money for it.''</p>
        <p>In the last year, an increasing number of Manhattan's co-op boards have tightened their rules on renovations, imposing stiff renovation fees to compensate for the extra work for building staff members; limiting work to six weeks, or to the summer months when the neighbors are in Maine or Avignon; demanding hefty security deposits for even minor alterations like sanding the floors or replacing a toilet. In growing numbers, boards are voting to send their own architects and engineers to inspect the apartments -- and sending the owners the bills.</p>
        <p>And they have started saying a resounding no to any remodeling that might result in that most dreaded of consequences: leaks. Greenhouse additions are often out of the question. So is creating a powder room over somebody else's hall or closet, known in the trade as ''wet over dry.''</p>
        <p>In interviews, board members and the lawyers who represent the boards say they have no choice: with the current prosperity, more and more apartment owners, many of them rich and young and full of nerve, are making drastic changes that do not match the plans they file.</p>
        <p>''People have showed the board plans for a small-scale renovation -- maybe replacing some kitchen cabinets -- and the board passed it through,'' said Stuart Saft, a real estate lawyer who is chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums. ''Then they started knocking down plaster walls.''</p>
        <p>Generally, the fanciest buildings get burned the worst, real estate brokers and lawyers say. That's because the renovations in such places tend to be the most extensive -- and, they say, the shareholders the most spoiled.</p>
        <p>Several shareholders at the San Remo, one of the fanciest prewar towers on Central Park West, said they were delighted when Steven Spielberg, the director, bought an apartment there. But some feelings soured when Mr. Spielberg's contractors started jackhammering and the renovation dragged on a year and a half.</p>
        <p>The San Remo, which also had to put up with renovation lasting almost 10 years by Steven P. Jobs, a founder of Apple Computers, now has imposed a six-month limit. It also requires resident renovators to provide a flow chart, which is monitored twice monthly by the building's architect. The board frowns on rip-it-all-out renovations or the combining of apartments.</p>
        <p>At the Beresford, Jerry Seinfeld is still unable to move into his 2,000-square-foot duplex. Getting the renovation approved was ''horrendous,'' said a person familiar with the job, which has already taken more than two years and includes the reconstruction of a terrace overlooking Central Park.</p>
        <p>Another building, 262 Central Park West, recently limited the number of renovations buildingwide: ''One renovation for each elevator'' at a time, said Frederick W. Peters, the president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate, who is a former board president there.</p>
        <p>At 740 Park Avenue, new owners who just paid $37 million for the 34-room penthouse once owned by Saul P. Steinberg are embarking on a lavish renovation that could take years. Last winter the board, for the first time, imposed summer work rules -- construction is allowed only between Memorial Day and Labor Day.</p>
        <p>Why are the boards becoming tougher? ''There's so much money floating around,'' Mr. Saft said, ''and therefore, there's more extensive renovations: more time, more noise, more dust, more debris, more clutter for other residents.''</p>
        <p>Jane Ekstein, a former board president at the San Remo, agreed. ''Our board is not capricious,'' she said. The tougher rules ''are not necessarily to put a gun to the shareholders' heads, but to the contractors','' she explained. ''The boards are trying to rein in the contractors, who many times will drag a job out over a year when it could take six months.'' The rules, she said, protect not only the neighbors but the shareholders who are doing the work.</p>
        <p>With the current renovation boom, ''the contractors come in for a few days and then take off because they've accepted money to start 14 other jobs,'' Mr. Saft said. Recently, the number of complaints to the City Consumer Affairs Department about contractors has greatly increased, said Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman. In 1999, there were 894 complaints for the whole year. In the first five months of 2000, the latest period available, there were 738.</p>
        <p>Mr. Saft said he often argued against a two-month construction limit. ''It's really unrealistic, especially in a prewar building if you have to rewire and replumb a kitchen and bathroom, never mind making them snazzy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, a new apartment owner might have wanted new bathroom fixtures, paint and wallpaper. ''Now they want to put in central air,'' Mr. Saft said. That requires ripping out walls and floors and putting in hundreds of feet of metal ductwork, and it creates a lot of dust and noise.</p>
        <p>All this work might be expected to make contractors and interior designers happy, but they say the boards' new attitude is making it tough on them. Joseph Kusnick, president of A. E. Greyson, a construction company in Manhattan, said the boards now try to discourage any work at all. He said that one building on East 88th Street prohibited the use of the freight elevator and demanded that one resident have a window-size hole cut in the exterior masonry so that building materials could be hoisted up the side of the building and through it. The apartment was on the 11th floor.</p>
        <p>Other buildings, Mr. Kusnick continued, insist that if an old interior wall is torn down, the new one must be constructed the same way, with three coats of plaster over lath.</p>
        <p>Alexander Gorlin, a Manhattan architect, grumbled about the boards' attitude about the ''wet over dry'' issue. ''When we tried to move a bathroom two feet -- just because it bumped it into a dry area -- they made it very tough,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gorlin said his client ultimately prevailed: a lead pan was installed under the fixtures and the board was persuaded that the alterations would actually reduce the chance of leaks. ''All those other people had moved their bathrooms 20 feet,'' he said. ''But that was in the old days.''</p>
        <p>Aaron Shmulewitz, a real estate lawyer who represents 200 co-op boards, said that besides the conventional applications, more and more boards are, for the first time, adopting a ''decorating agreement,'' encompassing cabinet replacement, wallpapering and painting.</p>
        <p>Why would the board care? ''They're scared to death of liability, so if they see a worker, even if he's lugging a roll of wallpaper, they want to see his insurance certificate,'' said I. Dolly Lenz, a broker with Douglas Elliman. ''It's getting very tedious.''</p>
        <p>In a not-so-fancy co-op near Gracie Mansion, residents wishing to sand their floors once merely notified the managing agent. Today, a simple sanding (cost, $1,200) requires a $5,000 security deposit, an insurance certificate from the sander and letters notifying all the adjacent apartment owners. All that paperwork was too much for one hapless new owner, who is still sleeping on an air mattress on the old stained floor.</p>
        <p>If a $5,000 security deposit sounds like a lot, hold on to your checkbook. ''Depending on the scope of the work, it's not unusual to see $50,000 and more,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said. ''Five years ago? It would have been $1,000, $2,000 at the most.'' Nowadays, buildings are actually dipping into the deposits, lawyers say, and imposing stiff fines that can sometimes be even larger than the deposits. ''You will forfeit $500 a day if your work is not done when you said it would be,'' Mr. Shmulewitz said. Some owners, aware in advance that jobs may run past the board's deadline, are figuring the fines into the cost of their renovations.</p>
        <p>If they are crossed, co-op boards do not hesitate to stop a job -- and they have rarely been sued. ''We've stopped quite a few,'' said Ronni Aroughetti, president of Heron Ltd., a managing agent for co-op and condo buildings. ''We inspect the apartment and we see they were going well beyond what they said they were doing.''</p>
        <p>In one luxury prewar building on the Upper West Side, she continued, the residents had taken out a load-bearing wall -- demolition that wasn't in their blueprints. ''The whole building was in danger of falling down,'' Ms. Aroughetti said. Work was stopped immediately; the wall had to be rebuilt before the job could continue. (In most cases, work can resume if damage is repaired and the shareholder adheres to what is approved, she said.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Aroughetti, who is also a lawyer, helped write a new model alteration agreement that is being distributed by the Real Estate Board of New York. For the buildings she manages, she recommends not taking the shareholder's word for the scope of the job, but insisting on seeing the signed agreement with the general contractor.</p>
        <p>Is there anything else besides caution behind the boards' new toughness?</p>
        <p>''Like jealousy?'' replied Mr. Saft, who works with dozens of boards. ''Of course, some middle-age people do resent the 20-somethings who are buying a multimillion-dollar apartment and then demolishing it.'' He paused. ''I wouldn't doubt that for a minute.''</p>
