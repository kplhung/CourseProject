        <p>For one of the nation's top bank executives, William B. Harrison Jr. is surprisingly accustomed to the background.</p>
        <p>At the University of North Carolina in the 1960's, he warmed the bench on a basketball team that included a future member of the Hall of Fame. At Chemical Bank, which he joined soon after graduation, he rose through the ranks in the shadow of Walter Shipley, his mentor. Even last year, when Mr. Harrison became the chief executive of Chase Manhattan, with which Chemical had earlier merged, many employees still had little sense of who he was.</p>
        <p>Today, however, as the chief executive of the corporate behemoth that will result from the combination of Chase Manhattan and J. P. Morgan, Mr. Harrison finds himself squarely in the spotlight. The lanky North Carolina native may lack the forceful personality of other bank executives, like Sanford I. Weill at Citigroup or David H. Komansky at Merrill Lynch, but his task will be one of the most watched on Wall Street: to meld successfully two different companies into the world's third-largest financial institution.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan, founded in 1861 by its namesake, is among the leading managers of money for blue-chip companies and wealthy individuals. Chase has a larger, middle-market business, with a commercial unit that includes more than 500 branches and a corporate division focused on smaller or higher-risk concerns. Mr. Harrison and his fellow executives hope the new company can combine J. P. Morgan's expertise at developing new products with Chase's large customer base to become one of the nation's top investment banks, which neither has been on its own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison may not be the most charismatic leader, friends and associates said, but few other executives have his experience in overseeing complicated mergers. Over the last decade, he has played a vital role in two important deals.</p>
        <p>First, Chemical merged with Manufacturers Hanover, another New York bank, in 1991, the same year Mr. Harrison became vice chairman. Five years later, it bought Chase Manhattan and took the name of the older company in the process.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mr. Shipley and Mr. Harrison were careful not to pull a power play by ousting all the top executives at the banks they were acquiring. Instead, the two tried to identify the most talented managers and then sought to keep them, analysts said, and Mr. Harrison has also been comfortable dipping into competitors' executive ranks to fill key posts.</p>
        <p>''When they've done mergers, they've done them in a very collegial way,'' said Ronald Mandle, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, who had predicted the Chase-Morgan merger.</p>
        <p>James McCormick, the president of the First Manhattan Consulting Group, who has worked on and off with Mr. Harrison the last 15 years, said his experience handling bank mergers is ''unparalleled,'' particularly as it relates to not upsetting the large corporate clients of either bank.</p>
        <p>Associates say Mr. Harrison is a good listener who is also comfortable crunching numbers on his own or making an unpopular decision. ''I don't think he's a consensus manager by any stretch of the imagination,'' said John F. McGillicuddy, the former head of Manufacturers Hanover who sits on Chase's international advisory board. ''He listens to people and then makes his own decision.''</p>
        <p>In a recent interview with American Banker, Mr. Harrison said, ''I'm not the type of person who goes home and agonizes over a decision I've made.''</p>
        <p>His banking roots run deep. He was born in 1943 in Rocky Mount, N.C., where his grandfather ran a bank at the middle of the century. As a teenager, Mr. Harrison worked at the bank in the summer. His father was a full-time employee and also served as the mayor of Rocky Mount.</p>
        <p>In 1962, the younger Mr. Harrison moved 100 miles west to Chapel Hill to attend the University of North Carolina and play basketball there, as his father had in the 1930's. The son was far from a star, however. In his only year on the varsity, the 6-foot-4 forward played in just two games and took two shots, making one. (The star of the team was Billy Cunningham, now in the Hall of Fame.)</p>
        <p>Even though Mr. Harrison quit after that season, he has said he learned a good deal about management from his coach, Dean Smith, who was then in the third year of a tenure that would last 35 more years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison joined Chemical soon after graduating with a degree in economics and has never left. He oversaw its European business in the early 1980's and then returned to New York to lead Chemical's corporate banking division.</p>
        <p>Since becoming chief executive last year, Mr. Harrison has spent much of his time trying to change Chase's status as a technology laggard, with a struggling online banking business and little ability to underwrite initial public offerings. He took the bank's senior executives on a trip to the West Coast to meet William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and Scott McNealy, the head of Sun Microsystems. Mr. Harrison also led Chase's purchase of Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a San Francisco boutique known for helping small technology companies go public.</p>
        <p>Along the way, however, he has developed little of a public persona and, if yesterday's announcement of the deal was any indication, Mr. Harrison may be happy to let that continue. As is his custom, he deferred to other Chase executives on a variety of questions. He even allowed Douglas A. Warner III -- the head of J. P. Morgan, the company Mr. Harrison is taking over -- to speak first and, in an interview later, to interrupt him on more than once occasion.</p>
