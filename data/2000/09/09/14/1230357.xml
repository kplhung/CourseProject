        <p>Cinderella rejects the prince, Little Red Riding Hood has a crush on the wolf, and Rapunzel cuts her hair. Three New York artists wondered how fairy tales might be retold by their characters. ''Fair E-Tales,'' put online last week (three.org), lets readers pick multiple viewpoints for each story. ''If you only have one story, you think that's the only way it could be,'' said Joline Blais, who created the project with Keith Frank and Jon Ippolito. And not all the stories end happily. ''The happy ending that Walt Disney gives us is neither true nor helpful -- nor satisfying to children,'' Ms. Blais said.</p>
