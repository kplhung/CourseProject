        <p>Jerry Patel, a retired coach from Orlando, Fla., reached Sydney late Tuesday without Olympic tickets. Early Wednesday he joined the long, last-minute lines for seats to the Games.</p>
        <p>Tickets are selling at 50,000 a day as Australians, and visitors like Patel, are rushing to join lines that stretch hundreds of yards outside downtown agencies.</p>
        <p>As he faced a three-hour wait on Wattle Street, Patel said he was willing to pay the $900 for good seats for Friday's opening ceremony.</p>
        <p>A marshal told him there were only a handful left, but there were several hundred potential buyers ahead of Patel.</p>
        <p>He was also a customer for seats for volleyball and table tennis -- both of which he coached in India and the United States -- and men's field hockey.</p>
        <p>The spring sunshine was warm -- and the forecast is fair for the first days of the Games -- and Patel was unconcerned about the long wait.</p>
        <p>''I'll pay top dollar if I can get what I want,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Others in the line, mostly Australians, complained of delays, box-office bungles and lack of suburban ticket outlets -- all criticisms familiar to Sydney's Olympic ticket managers, battle scarred by 18 months of marketing problems, including ill-fated attempts to hide reservations of seats for corporate customers.</p>
        <p>With the turnstiles about to start clicking for the Games, officials point to the bottom line when customers point to the long lines. Eighty percent of tickets have been sold and Sydney is on track to match or exceed the 1992 record of 82 percent for the Barcelona Games.</p>
        <p>Through Wednesday, some 5.8 million of the 7,605,065 Olympic tickets available had been sold, bringing overall ticket sales to about $400 million so far.</p>
        <p>With lines getting longer, and time getting shorter, John O'Neill, a ticketing spokesman, announced that some selling offices would stay open 24 hours and express lanes would operate for collection of prepaid seats.</p>
