        <p>When Representative Michael P. Forbes of Long Island switched from Republican to Democrat last year, Republicans put him at the top of their hit list.</p>
        <p>But they didn't imagine that a 71-year-old former school librarian and former garden club vice president, a Democrat who practices pro bono environmental law in her Bellport home, would knock him off.</p>
        <p>Now, as both parties contemplate what appears to be a 39-vote victory by Regina Seltzer, a former Brookhaven councilwoman, in Tuesday's Democratic primary, it is unclear who defeated him: the Republicans or the Democrat.</p>
        <p>Final results may not be available for several days. But if the vote holds up -- and Mr. Forbes voiced no hope that it would not -- the result could help the Republicans take  back a critical seat in the fight for control of the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>A glum Mr. Forbes said today that a huge Republican effort to support Ms. Seltzer had made the difference in the race. And even many people who praised Ms. Seltzer were skeptical of her chances of defeating the Republican candidate, Felix J. Grucci Jr., supervisor of the town of Brookhaven. Mr. Grucci also has the support of the Conservative, Independence and Right to Life Parties.</p>
        <p>''She's excellent,'' said Desmond M. Ryan, a veteran lobbyist and executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, a developers' lobby. ''She's got a background. She's got a history. She comes across like everybody's grandmother.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying we won't send a grandmother to Washington, but it's rather difficult for a 71-year-old woman to effectively conduct a door-to-door campaign against a well-financed, formidably entrenched opponent.'' He also faulted Mr. Forbes for ignoring the importance of the primary.</p>
        <p>In a historically quirky district where Republicans outnumber Democrats almost two to one, the New York State Republican Committee fought long and hard against their former congressman. They sent out eight pieces of glossy campaign literature, criticizing Mr. Forbes's antiabortion stance and asking voters, among other things, ''Should buyers at gun shows have to pass a criminal background check? Congressman Mike Forbes doesn't think so.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes did not release figures on his primary campaign spending. Ms. Seltzer, who keeps her law books in the garage with the Ford Escort so they don't get moldy in her basement office, spent $40,000 in campaign contributions and nothing from her own funds, she said.</p>
        <p>But without the financial aid she got from the opposing party in the primary, Ms. Seltzer will have an uphill battle in November, analysts say.</p>
        <p>In a Washington press conference today,  Mr. Forbes said that while he would ask for a recount, he was not optimistic about its results. He blamed ''venomous'' Republicans for beating him.</p>
        <p>''This was a campaign against Michael Forbes, not for Regina Seltzer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In some ways, the Republicans considered the primary a grudge match, and a lesson for defectors.</p>
        <p>''I'm tempted to ask for a recount, because we were so looking forward to beating Mike Forbes,'' said Tom Davis, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''But New York Democrats beat us to it, and in the process destroyed Democrats' hopes for a majority.''</p>
        <p>Dan Allen, spokesman for the New York State Republican Committee, said that other Republican groups had organized phone calls to get out the vote against Mr. Forbes, and that his group was pleased with the results of their mailings.</p>
        <p>''I think we devoted a substantial amount of resources to assure that all the families out in Suffolk County knew what kind of congressman they had,'' said Mr. Allen, who would not say how many pieces of mail were sent to Democrats, or the cost.</p>
        <p>Howard Scarrow, a professor of political science at the SUNY campus in Stony Brook, estimated that the party had spent $100,000 to beat Mr. Forbes. He personally received five pieces of anti-Forbes mail and two or three phone calls about the primary.</p>
        <p>''I guess the Republicans should be very happy,'' Professor Scarrow said. ''I guess they think Seltzer would be a much easier target for Grucci than would be Forbes.''</p>
        <p>''The Republicans accused Forbes of having the same positions on gun control and abortion and something else as their own candidate, Grucci. But of course that was beside the point.''</p>
        <p>At the new Democratic headquarters for the First Congressional District race, a split-level home overlooking Fire Island in the freshly scrubbed village of Bellport, Ms. Seltzer appeared ready for a fight.</p>
        <p>In 1975, she was one of four Democrats, the first since 1920, to be voted onto the Brookhaven Town Council. After all four were voted out four years later, she entered Hofstra Law School, saying she was tired of being patronized by lawyers who told her she had really good ideas, but lacked the law degree she needed to put them into practice.</p>
        <p>She later started her own practice, specializing in children's issues and local environmental cases without charging fees. She ran for the Congressional seat, she said, ''because no one else would do this race.''</p>
        <p>She takes issue with the Republican positions on gun control, Medicare, abortion and campaign finance reform. She speaks most passionately about the need to preserve the purity of Long Island's water supply, and about her legal work. She was up until 3 a.m. finishing briefs the other night, she said, and up just as late the night of the primary.</p>
        <p>''I've always felt, all my life, that when a good man does nothing, evil prevails,'' she said. ''I wouldn't go so far as to say Mr. Forbes is evil, but my feeling is, it was wrong, absolutely wrong, to have him run on the Democratic line. It was essentially giving the Republicans two candidates.''</p>
