        <p>President Clinton has delayed new punitive duties on European luxury goods, including Scottish cashmere, British shortbread and Italian pecorino cheese, after Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain shifted his position on two festering trade issues to help the United States, administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton decided to put off publication of a new sanctions list late last week after Mr. Blair made an impassioned appeal to Mr. Clinton, arguing that the 100 percent duties -- especially those planned on $50 million of cashmere that comes from Britain -- would do more harm than good to the already strained trade relationship between the United States and the European Union, officials said.</p>
        <p>The Senate, meanwhile, cleared the last major hurdle today to passing a trade bill with China. [Page A8.]</p>
        <p>The luxury-goods sanctions have been placed in ''strategic limbo,'' one senior administration official said. The official said the decision was made after Mr. Blair's personal appeal to Mr. Clinton on the sidelines of a United Nations summit meeting last week; the two are considered close allies and friends.</p>
        <p>But the official added that it also became clear that Britain had pushed a moderate line within the European Union on resolving disputes over banana imports and United States tax breaks, including taking a stance in a European Union ministers meeting last Friday. The United States official described that support as ''unprecedented.''</p>
        <p>So the reprieve on the luxury duties might help United States trade negotiators steer clear of a collision with Europe in a potentially far more costly trade dispute over the tax breaks that Washington gives major American exporters.</p>
        <p>Talks between the United States and Europe over how to avoid retaliation against American products in the export tax case will resume in Washington this week, with one official of the administration saying that he was ''cautiously hopeful'' that a deadline of Oct. 1 could be extended while a compromise is being worked out. The confluence of these issues shows how delicate United States-Europe trade relations have become. Each side has won headline-grabbing victories against the other at the World Trade Organization in Geneva. But both sides must grapple with influential domestic constituencies and broad diplomatic concerns as they ponder whether and how to impose retaliatory sanctions.</p>
        <p>The administration is obligated by law to rotate the items on the list of $300 million worth of European luxury goods sanctioned after the United States won a trade organization case against Europe's restrictions on beef and banana imports.</p>
        <p>Congress mandated the rotation to make the sanctions more painful and less predictable, ideally forcing Europe to open its market to beef and bananas instead of refusing to adhere to the trade body's decisions.</p>
        <p>But one administration official said that he believed the threat of including key British exports on the sanctions list had proved more powerful than actually imposing the duties. As word of the new list leaked out, Britain became demonstrably more cooperative, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is not likely to put off new sanctions indefinitely. Barring an unanticipated breakthrough in pressing trade disputes, a new list will be published shortly, officials said. But they added that they are not mandated to include cashmere, which has proved especially worrisome to Mr. Blair.</p>
        <p>Britain is considered essential to resolving the longstanding banana dispute because the European Union, which set trade policy for its member states, effectively inherited the British system of preference for goods produced in its former colonies. Once considered the most vociferous proponent of maintaining that preference system, Britain is now seen by some administration officials as their strongest advocate for opening Europe's market to freer trade in bananas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair has also argued that he has been pushing a more flexible European line on the tax break issue, the official said. And the tax breaks are, by a factor of 20, more important to American companies than beef and bananas.</p>
        <p>American companies, including Boeing and General Motors, avoid an estimated $4 billion a year in taxes by sheltering some foreign sales in offshore shell companies. The World Trade Organization ruled this year that that provision in the American tax code violated international trade agreements and that Europe had the right to impose potentially sweeping sanctions on American goods as soon as October.</p>
        <p>The administration is trying to buy time from Europe to pass legislation overhauling the tax code, potentially bringing it into compliance with the trade organization's rules.</p>
        <p>The House today overwhelmingly approved the administration's plan by a vote of 315 to 109. The Senate is expected to take up the measure shortly. The bill would replace the so-called Foreign Sales Corporation program with a new tax plan that would exempt certain kinds of foreign-earned profits from United States taxes. The new rules do not require that those sales be channeled through offshore tax havens.</p>
        <p>Supporters argue that the revamped tax break meets the trade organization's requirements because it becomes a part of the general tax code rather than a targeted export subsidy, which is forbidden under trade rules. But the new law would actually increase tax breaks on foreign sales by American companies to an estimated $6 billion annually.</p>
        <p>European Union officials have flatly rejected the new plan as nothing more than a broader application of the same subsidy, insisting that they would press ahead with their challenge and carry out what could amount to many billions of dollars in sanctions.</p>
        <p>Some American officials hope a compromise is still possible. They are pressing their European counterparts this week to agree to suspend any sanctions for weeks or months after the Oct. 1 deadline -- at least until the trade organization has a chance to review the new United States tax rules.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they had no intention of swapping sanctions on beef and bananas for European good will on the tax issue. But at the same time, they said, the overlap in the two disputes makes it impossible to ignore that the quick application of sanctions on luxury goods could prompt a damaging escalation of the dispute over taxes.</p>
        <p>The domestic politics of the sanctions nexus are also tricky. Carl H. Lindner, chief executive of Chiquita Brands International, a major banana producer, has pushed incessantly to punish British goods, administration officials said. Mr. Lindner is a major donor to both political parties. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, has also argued strongly that the sanctions list should be published immediately, and that it should have teeth.</p>
        <p>''They are three months late with the list,'' said John S. Czwartacki, Mr. Lott's spokesman. ''We need to hit this now.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, administration officials said that the chief executives of numerous multinationals had made clear that they considered  the tax break question a top priority.</p>
        <p>Sooner or later, the administration is likely to put heavy duties on a new list of luxury goods. A tentative list includes a variety of popular European imports.</p>
        <p>Some of those under consideration are: mineral water, canned fruits, paprika and sweet biscuits, as well as cashmere, the headline item. They would replace some goods on which duties have been levied since April 1999, including: bath salts, lithographs, batteries and chicory.</p>
        <p>Sanctions on some items, including plastic handbags, like those made by Louis Vuitton, are expected to carry over to the new list from the old one.</p>
