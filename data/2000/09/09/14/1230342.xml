        <p>Saffron in the Garden</p>
        <p>Q.  Last fall I read about a farmer who grows a few acres of saffron crocus to harvest and sell locally. How easy is it for a home gardener to grow saffron for personal use?</p>
        <p>A.  That farmer is earning his money. Saffron, the dried orange-red flower stigmas of the fall-blooming Crocus sativus, must be harvested by hand because machinery would damage the leaves, which are needed to produce food for the plant. So it's stoop (way down -- crocus flowers are only a couple of inches above the soil) and carefully pick the flower, take a step, stoop and pick again.</p>

        <p>Saffron in the Garden</p>
        <p>Q.  Last fall I read about a farmer who grows a few acres of saffron crocus to harvest and sell locally. How easy is it for a home gardener to grow saffron for personal use?</p>
        <p>A.  That farmer is earning his money. Saffron, the dried orange-red flower stigmas of the fall-blooming Crocus sativus, must be harvested by hand because machinery would damage the leaves, which are needed to produce food for the plant. So it's stoop (way down -- crocus flowers are only a couple of inches above the soil) and carefully pick the flower, take a step, stoop and pick again.</p>
        <p>It takes about 4,000 crocuses to yield the 12,000 or so stigmas needed for a single ounce of saffron, and every crocus means a bulb that has to be planted (by hand, bent over) and then harvested, and then lifted (by hand, bent over) every second or third spring to divide the daughter corms, and then each of the daughter corms has to be planted (by hand, bent over). Close your eyes and imagine doing that for a single row, let alone a few acres, and you might not begrudge the farmer his profits.</p>
        <p>But if your back is strong and your desires can be satisfied with just a few dishes flavored with home-grown saffron (it takes the stigmas from 15 to 20 crocuses to make a single pinch of saffron), all it takes is a perfectly drained, full-sun site that bakes dry during the summer so the bulbs can lie dormant until fall. Plant saffron crocus in early September and the flowers will be ready for harvest in October or November. Air-dry the stigmas after separating them from the flowers (by hand, bent over the kitchen table).</p>
        <p>Hydrangea Mystery</p>
        <p>Q.  When I bought my house in Newton, Mass., seven years ago, my hydrangeas produced large blue flowers. At the end of the season I would cut the shoots to the ground. After two or three years, the shrubs grew foliage but no blossoms.</p>
        <p>So I experimented. I did not cut all of them down at the end of the season. I found that in spring the old shoots did not leaf out, although the new growth was healthy. I therefore believe that my hydrangeas are the type that do not produce from old wood. Is there something I can do to cause them to flower again? Although I am no expert, I believe the shrubs are what is called ''nikko blue.''</p>
        <p>A.  Grab a cup of coffee: you might have to read this twice for it to make sense. Nikko Blue is a cultivar of Hydrangea macrophylla, one of the hydrangeas that do bloom on old wood -- sort of. Each year new shoots arise from the plant's crown. They are easy to spot because they don't have any side branches. The following year, in late summer, they produce flowers both from terminal buds and from side shoots that grow during that summer. So the flowers are on new wood that comes from year-old wood.</p>
        <p>The years you cut them down and they still bloomed, you most likely cut them some distance above the soil, leaving some short year-old stems that could produce new side shoots. Then you may have gotten a bit neater, pruning right to the soil. Since there were no year-old shoots, there were no flowers the following summer.</p>
        <p>It all sounds complicated, but pruning these hydrangeas isn't that hard. As soon as the flowers become disreputable-looking, prune the stems that had flowers right down to the ground. (They'll die anyway in another year or so.) Prune only stems that have side branches -- those without side stems are the ones that will branch and flower next year. Unless you need to control size, don't prune them even partway. Leaving them whole encourages both food production this year and larger flowers next year.</p>
