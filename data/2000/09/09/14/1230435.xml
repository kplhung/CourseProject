        <p>Buffalo quarterback Rob Johnson sounded just fine on the phone today, his voice not betraying the aches his body endures after being sacked 10 times in two games, his confidence not darkened by the prospect of more hits to come.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Johnson should call New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe this week. Bledsoe could give Johnson a few tips on how to take a pounding from the Jets' pass rush, which sacked Bledsoe six times, and stay in the game.</p>
        <p>''The first couple of games, we've shown the ability not to pick up the blitz,'' Johnson said. ''I'm sure they're going to come after us.''</p>
        <p>The Bills, who face the Jets Sunday at Giants Stadium, are 2-0, but it has nothing to do with the protection Johnson has been offered, and even less to do with a running game that is supposed to be the cornerstone of the offense. The Bills have had to rely on their underrated defense -- the best in the league last season and the third best right now -- to stay in the game until the offense gets on track.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, the Bills scored 27 points in slightly more than three quarters against the Packers, but Johnson said they could have scored 40 if everything was working properly. In their season opener against Tennessee, the Bills rushed for 129 yards, but Johnson had 60 of them on scrambles. Running backs Antowain Smith, Shawn Bryson and Sammy Morris had just 69 yards in 29 attempts. Last weekend, the Bills rushed for just 89 yards, and Johnson had 31 of them on 7 scrambles. When the Bills were trying to preserve a 27-10 lead in the fourth quarter, they went three-and-out on their last three possessions, generating a total of 6 yards on 8 rushes.</p>
        <p>Johnson's reputation as a mobile quarterback with the arm strength to throw deep on the run has been sorely tested. He has had to avoid blitzes that his line, backs and tight ends have failed to pick up or that he has been late to recognize. And he has also lived up to his reputation as a brittle player, prone to injury. In the victory over Tennessee, Johnson had to be replaced by Alex Van Pelt after sustaining a stinger in his ankle. Doug Flutie, who started every game last season, only to lose his job to Johnson during the playoffs, has a groin injury and is listed as questionable for the Jets game.</p>
        <p>This, then, is not the best time for Johnson to face the Jets. They are enjoying a pass-rushing renaissance, spearheaded by the rookies Shaun Ellis and John Abraham, who were drafted precisely for this purpose. Last season, the Jets had 26 sacks. In two games this season, they already have seven. Although he does not start, Ellis has played the most of anyone on the defensive line. Al Groh, the Jets' head coach, said he would stick with the rotation he has used in the first two games, starting Rick Lyle at left end and bringing Ellis off the bench.</p>
        <p>''They're playing better than they were last year,'' Buffalo Coach Wade Phillips said. ''They are a better defensive team than they were. They do a good job of coming after you. We're worried about it.''</p>
        <p>After two weeks, the Jets have the sixth-best defense in the league, and the third best in the American Football Conference. But they are second in the conference against the pass, allowing an average of 171 yards a game. Marcus Coleman said he thinks that the defense, which endured a rocky transition in training camp to an entirely new coaching staff and which has fewer schemes than it did under Bill Belichick, the former defensive coordinator, no longer has to prove itself after its first two games.</p>
        <p>''What's added help is if the young guys can play like they have been playing, there's no telling how good we can be,'' Coleman said of Ellis and Abraham. ''That's every defensive back's dream, to have a pass rush. It's a lot easier to cover that way. If you don't think they're for real, I'll send you the films.''</p>
        <p>Johnson and the Bills already have them.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Linebacker BRYAN COX, who has taken a vow of silence against New York area reporters who cover the team but who has appeared on national programs, explained his position on Wednesday. Cox said he endured a difficult off-season, going through a divorce and dealing with the deaths of three people close to him -- a high school teacher, an uncle and Chiefs linebacker Derrick Thomas. Cox is now raising his two young children (he has two older children), and he does not want to do or say anything to embarrass himself and them. Cox attributed his screaming match with RAY HAMILTON, the defensive-line coach, during training camp to mounting frustration. Cox said he is still comfortable talking to national media outlets, but does not seem to think he has the self-control to monitor his words when talking to local reporters.</p>
