        <p>Unless the Yankees experience a monumental collapse this month, they will play their first postseason game in just 19 days. Joe Torre has a feel for what his starting lineup will look like that night. Bernie Williams should be healthy, Chuck Knoblauch should be easing in at second base and Jose Canseco or Glenallen Hill could start at designated hitter.</p>
        <p>There has been a slight mystery about who will pitch Game 1 of a potential division series, but Roger Clemens continued to demonstrate why there should be no debate. Clemens tormented his former team in steering the Yankees past the Toronto Blue Jays, 3-2, but only after the suddenly mortal Mariano Rivera dodged threats in the eighth and ninth innings at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Clemens had a robust fastball, precise control and growing confidence as he surrendered one run and eight hits in seven innings and won his ninth straight decision. Clemens is 9-0 with a 2.21 earned run average since being activated from the disabled list on July 2. The 38-year-old right-hander has not lost since the Mets battered him on June 9.</p>
        <p>''He's got this body language and attitude,'' Torre said, ''that he goes out there and dares people to beat him.''</p>
        <p>While Torre said the Yankees would study the matchups and then align the starters, he said it would be very surprising if Clemens were bypassed for the No. 1 position.</p>
        <p>''For certain, he's been the most consistent pitcher for us since the All-Star break,'' Torre said. ''He's been the most overpowering. He's been everything El Duque has been for the last year and a half.''</p>
        <p>Even though Torre will not make it official until he needs to, Clemens is also perfectly on target to start the first postseason game on Oct. 3. Clemens is scheduled to start on Sept. 18, 23 and 28 during the regular season and would have his normal four days of rest for Game 1 of the division series. Clemens refused to peer into his postseason crystal ball.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking that far ahead yet,'' said Clemens, who has allowed two earned runs in his last 30 innings. ''You don't know who's going to be here and who's not and what slot you're going to be in, if any.''</p>
        <p>The Blue Jays strung together three straight hits to start the eighth, scoring their first run and ending Clemens's night. Clemens received a standing ovation as he sauntered back to the dugout. The cheers increased as Clemens lifted his black glove to the 29,083 fans.</p>
        <p>Still, the Yankees were in a tense spot with the potential tying runs on first and second. Jeff Nelson whiffed Alex Gonzalez and handed the ball to Rivera, not the left-hander Mike Stanton, to face some solid left-handed batters.</p>
        <p>''Mo is my closer; what can I tell you?'' Torre said. ''It's just a situation I wanted him in the game.''</p>
        <p>After Dave Martinez's bloop single loaded the bases, Rivera induced Carlos Delgado, the triple crown threat, to pop out to catcher Jorge Posada. Rivera then retired Brad Fullmer on a liner to second.</p>
        <p>But there was more drama in the ninth.</p>
        <p>Tony Batista doubled and, after Rivera got two strikeouts, Mickey Morandini walked. Shannon Stewart singled to center to trim the score to 3-2 and Rivera retired Gonzalez on a fly to right to preserve the victory and exhale.</p>
        <p>Rivera, who walked through the clubhouse with bundles of ice attached to his elbow and shoulder, is not used to having four of the nine batters he faces reach base. Torre said Rivera was frustrated. Nelson said hitters were getting ''better wood'' on Rivera's pitches and squeezing out soft hits.</p>
        <p>''I feel strong, I feel healthy,'' Rivera said. ''That's what I care about. There are going to be games like this. Like I said, you just battle like I did and we came out winners.''</p>
        <p>After Clemens pumped a 1-2 fastball past Delgado to finish the first, the Yankees quickly gave him a lead when Tino Martinez belted a two-run homer into the first row of the right- field bleachers. It was Martinez's fourth homer and sixth hit in 11 career at-bats against Esteban Loaiza.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch, whose 3-for-3 effort last night gave him more hits (2 for 21) than he has had since being activated, punched a double in the third. He smartly took third as Stewart slipped after fielding Derek Jeter's lineout and scored on Paul O'Neill's single for a 3-0 edge.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>JOSE CANSECO has started six straight games for the Yankees and has six homers in 27 games, but Canseco does not think he is guaranteed a spot on the postseason roster. ''I don't take it for granted,'' Canseco said. But JOE TORRE indicated that GLENALLEN HILL and Canseco were not competing for one designated hitter spot and that both would probably be on the roster, with DAVID JUSTICE in the outfield on a full-time basis. Canseco said he has a relaxed attitude about his status because he has matured. ''I've been the best player in the world to a bum,'' Canseco said. ''I've been through more in this game than any other player.''</p>
        <p>DAVID WELLS (19-6) will try to become a 20-game winner for the first time in his career when he faces ANDY PETTITTE (18-7) tonight. ''You know he wants to beat us more than anything,'' Torre said.</p>
