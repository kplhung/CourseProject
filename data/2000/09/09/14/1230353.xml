        <p>The general mood surrounding Sting can be read almost as an economic indicator, like the number of new cars recently sold. In austere times the enduring hit-maker's gentility seems pompous, the privilege of an aristocrat in need of a quick beheading.</p>
        <p>But when consumer confidence is up, Sting's aura seems graceful rather than pompous, his good life and smooth art enviable properties. This year, everybody loves Sting: his latest album, ''Brand New Day''  (Interscope), is riding a slow wave to the top on the strength of the catchy ''Arabian Nights'' tale ''Desert Rose.'' Even the critics who love to pillory him admit that this latest effort is a pleasure.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night he joined the elite club of pop stars who have staged special events in Central Park, performing in the Great Meadow before 20,000 fans who obtained free tickets from the chain music store Best Buy, celebrating its entry into the New York market. This event capped a period in which Sting became the most sponsored star this side of the Backstreet Boys: his Web site (www.sting.compaq.com) and summer tour received support from the computer company Compaq, and ''Desert Rose'' gained popularity through a video and complementary television commercial featuring him promoting Jaguar luxury cars.</p>
        <p>No one seemed the least bothered by Best Buy's ubiquity at Central Park; such deals do not undermine Sting's credibility because they are utterly congruous with his image. Sting's music is the sound of money well spent. His signature mix of torchy balladry and uplifting dance pop can absorb almost any outside influences, and he furnishes his songs with cosmopolitan touches like the Algerian rai music that underlies ''Desert Rose'' or the Cuban conjunto rhythms that occasionally enlivened Tuesday's show. It's the old colonialist way, updated for an age of corporate, rather than state, domination: if you love something, buy it up. It's possible to view Sting's genre-shopping as artistically commendable. After all, this is pop, whose essence is assimilation. In his groundbreaking band the Police, Sting rubbed reggae against punk to create a hybrid whose energy reflected the anxiety caused by such miscegenation. As he matured, Sting grew suspicious of rock's amateurishness and moved toward an ideal based in poised musical interplay instead of conflict. His belief in a true world music led him to form outstanding bands, including the one appearing Tuesday. It also pushed his music toward a rootlessness that can seem decadent.</p>
        <p>His cosmopolitanism illuminates when it holds that seed of self-awareness. It's there in ''Desert Rose,'' in the amazing second vocal by Cheb Mami, the Algerian rai vocalist who joined Sting as an opening act at the concert. Sting, the Englishman, can nearly match the North African's sinewy technique, but Sting's fairy-tale lyrics about a veiled seductress are undermined by the immediacy of Cheb Mami's voice. Performing the song with him, Sting finally surrendered, allowing his partner to lead its final crescendo. Humbly giving over to his inspiration, Sting proved himself a sensitive collaborator.</p>
        <p>The same thing happened on his many jazz-inflected songs when he let his instrumentalists break out. The drummer Manu Katche added a suave French rap to ''Perfect Love Gone Wrong''  and agile syncopation throughout. The keyboardist Jason Rebello stood out as the most authoritative soloist, moving the band toward serious swing with his confident runs. The trumpeter Chris Botti and the guitarist Dominic Miller showed great skill but erred toward the side of vagueness; they settled for atmospherics when they should have shown some guts.</p>
        <p>That was easier to do when Sting's songs themselves had a tougher core. He has a weakness for the poetry of rain, moon and sun, which turns his lyrics toward banality. He's not so great at dispensing moral lessons, either; the sentimental conclusion of ''Fill Her Up,'' for example, sapped the life out of that country music parody, despite charming cameos by Sheryl Crow on vocals and Jonny Lang on guitar.</p>
        <p>''Moon Over Bourbon Street,'' a wandering torch song in which Sting fancied himself a vampire, and the Police's ''Roxanne,'' which allowed for an extended foray into dub reggae, had the edge Sting could always muster. The bass player also switched to guitar and showed off some dazzling Spanish fingerwork in ''Fragile,'' the hymnlike final encore.</p>
        <p>That devilish side that leads him to play with his musical sources and not just absorb them and to write from the perspective of a man who might be as corrupt as he is enlightened is the source of Sting's integrity. In this time of easy acquisition, few people care to wonder if he always maintains it. Times will toughen, though, and he'll need it again.</p>
