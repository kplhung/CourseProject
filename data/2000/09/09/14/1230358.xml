        <p>Owners of Palm handhelds that predate those released in February with new Palm OS 3.5 operating system will not be able to download the new system for free, as originally promised; it will cost 'under $20' and be released sometime in the fall together with Palm's Mobile Internet Kit (S)</p>

        <p>When Palm Computing introduced a batch of new Palm handhelds in February with a new operating system, Palm OS 3.5, it said the new system would be posted on its Web site in about 30 days or so. As in the past, owners of earlier Palm models would be able to download it for free.</p>
        <p>March and several more months have come and gone, and no upgrade has been made available.</p>
        <p>The upgrade will be released sometime this fall, Palm now says, but it will not be free.</p>
        <p>''Typically what you have seen in a Palm upgrade has been very incremental,'' said John Cook, senior director for consumer product marketing at the company. ''We think we have added a lot more value.''</p>
        <p>OS 3.5 incorporates many features that have been available for years as third-party add-ons: making menus appear by tapping the top of the screen and a new view in the calendar that shows  both appointments and ''to do'' items.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook said that Palm planned to charge less than $20 for the upgrade. It will be available on the Web or on a CD that will also have a new version of the Palm Desktop software for personal computers. The release is timed to coincide with the availability of Palm's Mobile Internet Kit, which will include OS 3.5 as well as wireless Internet software for under $50.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook said that he had already heard grumbling from some Palm users about the upgrading  fee and that some future releases might still be  free.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes it will make sense to charge for an upgrade,'' he said. ''Sometimes we will just give it to you to keep you whole as a customer.''</p>
