        <p>The felon, the drug addict, the banker, the dreamer, the next Golden Boy, a guy named Rocky and another nicknamed Hawaiian Punch.</p>
        <p>They are part of the 2000 United States Olympic boxing team, and while they are characters with rich personal stories, they are also considered the strongest group of American Olympic boxers in nearly 25 years.</p>
        <p>When the boxing competition of the Sydney Games dawns Saturday, the American team will once again meet its archrivals, the dominant Cubans, but it is also chasing the enduring memory of the charismatic 1976 American boxers.</p>
        <p>That team, led by Sugar Ray Leonard and the Spinks brothers, won five gold medals in Montreal. This year's team, with as many colorful personalities, is aiming even higher.</p>
        <p>''My wife has been in church praying for seven medals,'' said Coach Tom Mustin, though he did not specify seven gold medals.</p>
        <p>It has been a long road back to respectability for the Americans, who won just one gold medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''At the 1997 world championships in Budapest, we won just one bout,'' the American team leader, Gary Toney, said today. ''Not one medal -- one bout. But by last year's world championships, we had won four gold medals.''</p>
        <p>A change in philosophy has been credited with the improved results as the American team chose to compete more often internationally. It has led to a seasoned, savvy and diverse team.</p>
        <p>Begin with welterweight Dante Craig of Cincinnati, who was not even in boxing a little more than a year ago. After his mother died of breast cancer in 1998, Craig had given up the sport and went to work at a dry cleaner. ''I was the fastest pants presser they had,'' Craig said. ''Seventy pants an hour.''</p>
        <p>Then one day his brother, Dion, came to him and said he had been visited by their mother in a dream. She asked Dion to tell Dante to resume boxing.</p>
        <p>Craig did just that and advanced to last year's world championships, but a few days before he was to compete, he learned that his 3-month-old son, Dante Jr., had died of a respiratory infection. Craig, 22, pulled out of the tournament, then came back again -- and in an upset qualified for a spot in the Olympic trials. He also had emergency root canal the day before the final bout.</p>
        <p>''My story is so unbelievable, I don't know if I believe it,'' Craig said.</p>
        <p>The American superheavyweight Calvin Brock has been boxing for 13 years, but with a college degree in finance he recently began a management training program at a bank in his hometown, Charlotte, N.C. This spring he asked his new bosses for time off in September.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to the Olympics,'' he told them.</p>
        <p>They asked how he got tickets.</p>
        <p>''No, I'm going to be in the Olympics,'' Brock said.</p>
        <p>Heavyweight Michael Bennett is at the center of the Olympic boxing tournament's most featured rivalry as he tries to unseat the two-time Olympic champion, Felix Savon of Cuba. Bennett's path to the Olympics could not be more uncommon and his ascent in the sport more meteoric.</p>
        <p>A little more than two years ago, Bennett, 29, was serving the end of a seven-year sentence for armed robbery. Bennett had taken up boxing in prison and then quickly adapted to the techniques and styles of international boxing.</p>
        <p>Last year, he and Savon, the six-time world champion, were scheduled to meet in the world championship gold medal final. Savon, protesting an earlier judging decision against a Cuban teammate, refused to enter the ring. Bennett won by default, but he wants another shot.</p>
        <p>''It's all about knocking off the king of the hill,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Bennett may be the best known of the American fighters, but the team is led by its smallest fighter, light flyweight Brian Viloria. Viloria, also a reigning world champ, is the first Hawaiian native on the boxing team in 44 years, and hence his rather obvious nickname.</p>
        <p>''Hawaiian Punch isn't very original,'' the studious Viloria said today in Sydney. ''But what are you going to do?''</p>
        <p>Viloria, who is 5 feet 4 and 106 pounds, is quick and powerful. To strengthen his hands, Viloria punched banana trees.</p>
        <p>Another reigning world champion is featherweight Ricardo Rocky Juarez. He is named after Rocky Marciano, not Rocky Balboa.</p>
        <p>Olanda Anderson is the 27-year-old light heavyweight who was added to the team when Michael Simms, the 1999 world champion in the division, was thrown off the team for violating team policies.</p>
        <p>Lightweight David Jackson is the American entry at 132 pounds, although a year ago he weighed 174 pounds. Jackson had been living on the streets of Seattle, battling drug problems. Retired from boxing, he went back in the gym hoping the sport could save him.</p>
        <p>''Without boxing, I'd probably be dead,'' Jackson said.</p>
        <p>Growing up in Los Angeles, flyweight Jose Navarro was influenced greatly by Oscar De La Hoya, a local hero and the 1992 Olympic champion. With an easy smile, Navarro has been called the next Golden Boy.</p>
        <p>''That's saying a lot,'' Navarro, who is 19, said. ''I'm just getting started.''</p>
        <p>Bantamweight Clarence Vinson, light welterweight Ricardo Williams Jr., light middleweight Jermain Taylor and middleweight Jeff Lacy make up the rest of the lineup, an engaging team with exceedingly high expectations for itself.</p>
        <p>''People talk to us about the 1976 team all the time,'' Juarez said today. ''Hopefully, we can win 12 gold medals.''</p>
