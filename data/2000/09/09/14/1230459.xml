        <p>The weather and the lifestyle have always been hospitable to sports in Australia. The sun shines frequently and temperatures in the major cities enable Australians to play all manner of games year-round.</p>
        <p>But by 1976, something had changed. Australians failed to bring home any gold medals from the Summer Olympics in Montreal. That outcome -- a sharp reversal from the eight golds won by Australians at the 1972 Games in Munich -- was unacceptable for a country that had grown accustomed to defining itself through international sports success.</p>
        <p>Sports officials devised a plan to become more competitive, and one of the models was East Germany, whose athletes had won 40 gold medals in Montreal to finish second in the overall count behind the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The East Germans had developed a centralized, government-sponsored sports system. Australians decided to do the same, and in January 1981, the Australian Institute of Sport opened its doors in Canberra, the capital. The goal, based on the East German example, was to bring together athletes, coaches, scientists, trainers, physiotherapists and nutritionists on a large, leafy campus to maximize elite athletes' performances. Institutionalized doping was not part of the plan, although it later became clear that it was an essential reason for East Germany's success.</p>
        <p>Nearly two decades later, with the Sydney Games set to open tomorrow, Australia has nearly completed its comeback. It is again an Olympic power, and with the help of home crowds and motivated, well-prepared athletes, it could set a new national standard by winning as many as 60 medals. Australia might finish as high as fourth in the medal count. That would be a remarkable achievement for a nation of 19 million people. (The United States, with 260 million people, won 101 medals in the 1996 Games in Atlanta.) What makes the prospect even more noteworthy is that most Australians prefer to play and watch sports that are not even on the Olympic program.</p>
        <p>Though there are an abundance of celebrated Australian swimmers (Ian Thorpe, Grant Hackett, Susan O'Neill, Kieren Perkins, Michael Klim) and one celebrity runner (Cathy Freeman, the two-time world 400-meter champion), the majority of Australia's most prominent athletes will not be splashing or sprinting for gold. Last year, Australians won world titles in rugby union, cricket and netball, a popular women's game here that resembles basketball. They also won the Davis Cup in tennis.</p>
        <p>''Sport in this country is the No. 1 thing,'' said an Australian assistant swim coach, Gennadi Touretsky, a Russian who was once a national swim coach in the Soviet Union. ''I don't know another country with a sports culture like this. Not one. I think we had a similar thing in Russia from the 1950's up until the 1970's. But this sport culture here is supported financially, because sport is one of the most successful businesses in Australia.''</p>
        <p>The team representing Australia at the Sydney Games will include 628 athletes, the biggest contingent at the Olympics. More than half of the athletes, 320, have received scholarships at one time or another from the Australian Institute of Sport and others have received aid from state sports institutes.</p>
        <p>For those in residence in Canberra, life is hardly luxurious. Long jumper Jai Taurima calls the dormitory rooms ''cells'' and a quick glance at a spartan, charmless room that recently became vacant makes it easy to see his point.</p>
        <p>But as at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, the hundreds of athletes at the Australian Institute have subsidized access to healthy food; excellent coaching; good, if not necessarily state-of-the-art, facilities; medical treatment; and one of the world's most respected sports science departments.</p>
        <p>''You've got everything at your beck and call,'' said Taurima, who left Brisbane and his beloved surfboard behind for Canberra three years ago. ''At home, I don't get any of that support stuff. The only thing is that no one is very keen to come down here.''</p>
        <p>That is because Canberra is geographically isolated and provincial in feel. But the national sports institute does get results: in Atlanta, 76 percent of the Australian medalists were former and current scholarship holders.</p>
        <p>The national and the state institutes are not the only reasons for Australia's Olympic renaissance. As is customary when a nation hosts an Olympics, public and private spending on sports has increased significantly.</p>
        <p>The collapse of Eastern Europe's Communist regimes has also contributed to the resurgence of Australian athletes. Countries like the former East Germany, whose success has been discredited because of proof of systematic, government-sponsored doping, no longer dominate the medal count.</p>
        <p>''There's an element of irony there certainly,'' said John Boultbee, the director of the Australian Institute of Sport.</p>
        <p>The East German model was not the ideal model after all. ''A lot of the stuff from the east was replicated here, but to say it's the same in every respect would certainly not be true,'' Boultbee said.</p>
        <p>In fact, there has been a doping scandal at the Australian Institute. In 1987, a javelin thrower, Sue Howland, tested positive for steroids and then accused coaches and athletes connected to the institute with supplying and using drugs. A government inquiry in 1989 was critical of the sports institute's drug-prevention efforts, particularly in track and field and weight lifting, and the institute was stripped of some of its autonomy.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, however, Australia has been one of the most vocal advocates for improved drug testing, and scientists at the national institute helped develop the new blood test for the banned substance EPO. The test is being used in conjunction with a French urine test for EPO in Sydney. ''It's a bit pious to say it, but I do think we are relatively clean even in the at-risk sports compared to a lot of our competitor countries,'' Boultbee said.</p>
        <p>Host nations traditionally perform much better at the Olympics. The last time the Games were held in Australia, in 1956 in Melbourne, Australians won 13 golds, a national record. This time, the president of the Australian Olympic Committee, John Coates, is predicting as many as 20.</p>
        <p>''It's up to us to set the standard,'' said Michellie Jones, an Australian athlete who is the favorite in the women's triathlon, which will be run Saturday morning (Friday night, Eastern time). ''And then it's up to the other Australians to run with it.''</p>
