        <p>The House of Representatives today endorsed for the first time a measure to make attacks on gays a federal hate crime, a move that was one of President Clinton's legislative priorities.</p>
        <p>But the 232-to-192 vote was entirely symbolic because it did not force lawmakers to adopt the measure, which passed the Senate as an amendment to a military bill in June, with broad bipartisan support.</p>
        <p>Rather, the measure, which drew the support of 41 Republicans, was a Democratic effort to force Republicans, as Election Day nears, to take a recorded stand on expanding the hate crimes definition to include attacks on gays and to pressure Republicans into accepting the measure.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders said today that the Senate amendment would be stripped from the military bill, a decision that is likely to lead to an end-of-the-year confrontation with President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Just before the House cast its vote, the president attended a rally for supporters of the measure, including Sherialyn Byrdsong, the widow of Ricky Byrdsong, a black man who was killed in 1999 by a 21-year-old white supremacist.</p>
        <p>Likening hate crimes to the Holocaust and efforts by Serbs to force ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo, Mr. Clinton urged Congress to endorse the measure, and he said he was ordering the Justice Department to improve its reporting of hate crimes. Some 7,755 hate crimes were reported last year, ''only the tip of the iceberg,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>''So this is very important,'' he added. ''It is just not true that hate crimes are like other crimes. It is not even true that every crime is a hate crime. And that fundamentally is at the heart of this debate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and Congressional Democrats say they hope today's strong vote sends a signal to Republican leaders that they should rethink their decision to kill the measure.</p>
        <p>''The reality is that it will be very hard to explain to the American people why, with bipartisan votes in both Houses, this isn't included in legislation that becomes law this year,'' said Jake Siewert, Mr. Clinton's press secretary.</p>
        <p>The vote today was a procedural one, a request that the lawmakers who are negotiating the military authorization bill include the Senate hate crimes legislation in the final product.</p>
        <p>The bill, sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, would expand federal jurisdiction for crimes based on race, religion and national origin to include sexual orientation, sex and disabilities. It passed the Senate 57 to 42.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore said, ''Passage of a strong hate crimes law will send a clear message that we value everyone in our society, and we will work together to oppose those who use hate to divide us.''</p>
        <p>Republicans who voted not to endorse the motion argued that the legislation was unnecessary because hate crimes were already adequately prosecuted by states and localities. They also framed the debate as one of state rights, maintaining that the bill would grant the United States attorney general too much power.</p>
        <p>Representative Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, offered an alternative proposal that failed. Mr. Graham argued that all crimes were heinous, none more so than the next.</p>
        <p>But Representative David E. Bonior, Democrat of Michigan, said: ''When hateful thoughts turn into hateful deeds, the Congress must act and act decisively. We can't outlaw hatred, but we have a moral responsibility to stand up to those who could be its victims.''</p>
