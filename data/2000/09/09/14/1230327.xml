        <p>Just in time for this fall's color craze: a reintroduced collection of brilliantly colored hand-woven Thai silk plaids, designed in the 1950's and 60's and out of production since the mid-70's. Jim Thompson, an American architect who moved to Thailand after World War II, turned the local silk textile business into an international triumph. In 1967, Mr. Thompson disappeared while on vacation in Malaysia. By then his company employed 20,000 weavers. The large plaids are $67.50 a yard at the Jim Thompson showroom (to the trade only), 979 Third Avenue (58th Street); (800) 262-0336 for other locations.</p>
