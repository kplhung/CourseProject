        <p>Democrats held the Congressional seat in this northwest Washington district for 30 years until the Republican tide of 1994 brought in Jack Metcalf, a state legislator and former high school history teacher who made it to the House of Representatives 26 years after his first attempt.</p>
        <p>Now, with Mr. Metcalf fulfilling his pledge to leave Congress after three terms, and with Democrats seeing the open seat as a prime opportunity to gain in the battle for control of the House, the race here in the Second Congressional District shows signs of becoming one of the most tightly fought in the nation.</p>
        <p>And though each of the major-party candidates plays down the notion that presidential coattails will be a major factor, some emerging themes in their race echo those in the campaign for the White House.</p>
        <p>The Republican candidate, John Koster, a 49-year-old state representative and third-generation dairy farmer, puts it very simply in promising to push for a big federal tax cut: ''Taxes are the first thing people are talking about to me.''</p>
        <p>His Democratic foe, Rick Larsen, 35, a Snohomish County councilman, says he will push for first reducing the national debt and shoring up Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>District voters, he said, were ''more concerned about using the surplus to pay down the debt. They want government to get its fiscal house in order. They want schools to be safe. They want to be sure seniors can get prescription drugs.''</p>
        <p>While drawing considerable attention because it involves the only open Congressional seat in the state, the race here is one of at least three House contests considered competitive this fall in Washington, which proved to be something of an electoral bellwether in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>The state's voters broadly backed Bill Clinton and Congressional Democrats in 1992, then turned with a fury to Republicans in 1994, giving them a 7-to-2 advantage in the House delegation and even ousting the speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, a Spokane Democrat. But they returned to Mr. Clinton in 1996, and by 1998 the Democrats had regained the edge, 5 to 4.</p>
        <p>Now the Democrats are hoping to add to that advantage by winning this district, which stretches from the Seattle suburbs north to the Canadian border, and possibly even ousting George Nethercutt, the Republican who unseated Mr. Foley six years ago and is now reneging on a term-limits pledge he made then.</p>
        <p>Republicans, meanwhile, hope to retake a majority of the delegation by holding on to both seats and knocking off the incumbent Democrat in the neighboring First District, Jay Inslee, whose seat changed hands three times in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>The outcome of the races here in Washington could go a long way to determining control of the House, where the Republicans now hold a tenuous majority: 222 seats, to 210 for the Democrats and 2 for independents, one usually in the Democratic camp, the other in the Republican. (One seat is vacant.) Democrats can regain control by picking up as few as seven seats in November.</p>
        <p>The district here was once reliably, even staunchly, Democratic. It was represented in the 1940's by Henry M. Jackson of Everett, who went on to become a senator and a national political figure. And as the Boeing Company became the dominant employer in the district and beyond, thousands of unionized workers here voted Democratic.</p>
        <p>But, as Mr. Koster noted in an interview, a number of Snohomish County's fast-growing suburbs have leaned Republican in recent years, and the more agricultural areas to the north also tend to vote Republican. Mr. Koster and Mr. Larsen agree that very roughly speaking, the district's electorate is now probably a third Democratic, a third Republican and a third independent.</p>
        <p>The campaign here has yet to catch fire but will undoubtedly do so as Election Day draws nearer. The two candidates have debated face to face only once so far, but they have clashed more recently over each other's records in office, and are expected to debate again in coming weeks.</p>
        <p>Neither expects to run TV advertising until next month. For one thing, while the primaries next week are crucial in some races, they are  not central to this one: each man is running unopposed for nomination.</p>
        <p>Moreover, neither reports having a huge amount of cash on hand -- Mr. Koster had only $176,000 as of Aug. 31, Mr. Larsen $212,000 -- though national leaders of both parties have said they expect to pour significant amounts into the race.</p>
        <p>If moderate swing voters are the key to the election, some advantage may befall Mr. Larsen, who often casts himself as a moderate. Mr. Koster is an unabashed conservative, proud to have voted against every state budget since 1994, and staunchly anti-abortion.</p>
        <p>Interviews with voters in the district suggest that many are only beginning to focus on the race, though quite a few cited cultural issues that had them leaning Republican and could aid the turnout for Mr. Koster.</p>
        <p>But others said the tax cut advocated by Mr. Koster did not hold much appeal. ''That's not as important as knowing your Medicare coverage will be there, knowing Social Security is sound,'' said Sherry Andrews, 51, a human resources administrator at Boeing.</p>
        <p>Another factor is Vice President Al Gore's rise in some statewide polls. If that trend holds, Mr. Koster might get less help from Gov. George W. Bush than some analysts were predicting earlier this summer.</p>
        <p>''When Bush's numbers were much higher, everyone expected there'd be coattails,'' Mr. Koster said. ''But we're running this campaign like it all depends on us.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 16, 2000, Saturday  An article on Thursday about the race for Washington State's Second Congressional District seat, from which Jack Metcalf is retiring, referred incorrectly to his first race, 32 years ago. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate, not the House.</p>
