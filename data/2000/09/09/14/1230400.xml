        <p>Harry Bosco, a 35-year veteran of Lucent Technologies, has joined Clarity Partners, a Los Angeles-based venture capital firm that specializes in media and communications.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bosco, 55, retired two months ago as president of Lucent's optical networking business and said he would work with entrepreneurs to develop companies in the telecommunications networking industry.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Bosco met David Lee, now a partner at Clarity, when Mr. Lee was an executive at Global Crossing, the undersea cable operator with offices in Beverly Hills. That two-year friendship, Mr. Bosco said, turned into an offer from Clarity to join as a special venture partner. Mr. Bosco will have offices in Los Angeles, New Jersey and Florida.</p>
