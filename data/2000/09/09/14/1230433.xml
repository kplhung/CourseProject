        <p>Plans by The New York Times to build a new headquarters on Eighth Avenue took intriguing form this week with the submission of competing proposals by some of the world's most renowned architects.</p>
        <p>Prismatic, polymorphous, scintillating and starkly angular, they defy the conventional idea of a boxy or stepped New York skyscraper.</p>
        <p>Though Times executives were quick to say that the architects' visions would bear little or no relation to the final design of the building, if such a building is even constructed, the models offer a tantalizing glimpse of the company's ambitious aspirations for the site, between 40th and 41st Streets.</p>
        <p>Three of the four entrants have won the Pritzker Architecture Prize, widely considered the platinum bar of the profession. They are Renzo Piano, Norman Foster and Frank O. Gehry, who is allied in his submission with Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. The other entrant, Cesar Pelli, has been a Pritzker juror.</p>
        <p>Michael Golden, the vice chairman and senior vice president of The New York Times Company, said yesterday that he hoped the final choice could be made next week.</p>
        <p>''We said we wanted this to be a difficult decision, and boy, is it,'' he said after the four presentations concluded.</p>
        <p>''We want a building that is an icon,'' Mr. Golden said, ''that speaks to our heritage and also speaks to our future.'' New York City, he said, is already rich in architecture. ''We want to make it richer.''</p>
        <p>The Times Company and its development partner, Forest City Ratner Companies, are planning a tower about 650 feet high, with 1.3 million square feet of space, across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The Times would occupy a little more than half the building, including the larger floors at its base. The rest would be leased to commercial and retail tenants.</p>
        <p>Although the 200-by-400-foot site is part of the Times Square redevelopment area, it is still in the hands of 11 different owners. The 42nd Street Development Project, a subsidiary of the Empire State Development Corporation, would acquire the properties through eminent domain and lease the land to the Times Company and Forest City Ratner.</p>
        <p>Construction might begin late next year or early in 2002, Mr. Golden said, with occupancy of the new building about two years later. The Times would probably sell the building at 229 West 43rd Street that it has occupied since 1913, Mr. Golden said.</p>
        <p>But he cautioned that the Times board had not yet decided to make the move and declined to estimate the cost of the project, saying it was too early to do so.</p>
        <p>''I should warn you that what you see won't be what you get,'' Mr. Golden told Times employees in a memo about the architectural presentations. ''The models represent the architects' design concepts at this point in time. The architect that is chosen will then embark upon a yearlong, detailed and complex process to design the building we will ultimately occupy.''</p>
        <p>That said, each concept is arresting.</p>
        <p>A towering right triangle has been proposed by Foster &amp; Partners of London. The high point would be on Eighth Avenue and the inclined facade on the east, with tree-filled terraces every seven stories. The sides would be criss-crossed with bold X bracing. The top of the building would be illuminated and could, the architect said, be assigned to an artist as a ''cultural billboard.''</p>
        <p>Lord Foster's projects have included the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong and the reconstruction of the Reichstag in Berlin.</p>
        <p>From Frank O. Gehry &amp; Associates of Santa Monica, Calif., has come a proposal for a tower with an undulating facade, wrapped in twisting, sinewy planes that blossom at the top and bustle at the bottom; not unlike pappardelle pasta on a colossal scale. At the top of the building would appear an ''N'' and ''Y'' in the black-letter typeface from the newspaper's nameplate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gehry, who astonished the world with the sinuous, titanium-roofed Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, has more recently designed a proposal for a new Guggenheim Museum on the Lower Manhattan waterfront.</p>
        <p>He is associated with Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, whose current projects include Columbus Center, soon to rise on the site of the New York Coliseum; the new Pennsylvania Station; and the new New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Cesar Pelli &amp; Associates of New Haven is probably best known in New York as the architect of the World Financial Center at Battery Park City and the Carnegie Hall Tower. But its proposal for the Times building is nothing like those.</p>
        <p>Rather than four square walls, Mr. Pelli calls for a series of suave, tapered, intersecting planes, each at a slightly different angle, topped by a slanting roof. There would be tree-filled atriums at either end of the building, which would rise out of a low base covering the entire site.</p>
        <p>Mr. Piano has proposed an irregular, rectangular tower whose facade consists of layers of diaphanous glass screens that almost seem to float in the air around the building. There would be a five-story atrium in the base, opening from Eighth Avenue, and a roof garden.</p>
        <p>In a caption accompanying his presentation, Mr. Piano said the Times building ''should introduce new qualities: lightness, vibration, transparency and immateriality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Piano attracted world attention in the 1970's with the startlingly exoskeletal Centre Pompidou in Paris, designed with Richard Rogers. Recent projects include the redevelopment of Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. The Renzo Piano Building Workshop is based in Paris and in Genoa, Italy.</p>
        <p>On the design committee are Mr. Golden; Janet L. Robinson, president and general manager of The Times newspaper; Bruce C. Ratner, president and chief executive of Forest City Ratner; James P. Stuckey, executive vice president of Forest City Ratner; Wendy Leventer, president of the 42nd Street Development Project; and Stephen Hayes, a vice president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.</p>
