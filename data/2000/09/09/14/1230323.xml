        <p>The automobile factory as theme park is gaining ground. In Wolfsburg, Germany, Volkswagen has opened the 62-acre, $400 million Autostadt museum, designed by Gunter Henn, with a manufacturing plant, lakes, cafes and a hotel. In December, Audi's $20 million Automuseum, above, will open in Ingolstadt. The glass-clad museum will trace Audi history since it began as Horch in 1899. Billed by the company as a comprehensive tourist concept (pick up a car, go on a factory tour, have a meal), the museum, also designed by Mr. Henn, will house exhibits on the relationship between man and technology (according to Julius Von Ingelheim, the project director, even stronger than that between man and woman). Some 60 cars and 20 motorcycles will be on view, including the 1939 Horch 855 Roadster, the 1927 Horch 303 and the 1923 Audi G.</p>
