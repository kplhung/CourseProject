        <p>One of the last vestiges of the Woolworth's empire lives on in a British company, Kingfisher P.L.C., and though it has managed to outlast its American parent, the chain of five-and-dime stores is still searching for its place in modern retailing.</p>
        <p>That place looked a bit less certain today, when Kingfisher said it would split itself in two as it reported half-year financial results that were dragged down by sagging profit in its general merchandise business.</p>
        <p>Pretax profit for the group fell 10 percent to $:232.5 million, or nearly $328 million, on sales of $:5.4 billion.</p>
        <p>The home improvement and electronics stores will form a new Kingfisher, the company said, while the general merchandise business, consisting of Woolworth's and a drugstore chain, will be shunted off into an as-yet-unnamed separate company. Kingfisher's chief executive, Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, said the breakup would help stimulate international expansion in the new Kingfisher's businesses. The old one will try to stem its profit decline at home.</p>
        <p>''If you're a shareholder, you'd want your shares in new Kingfisher, that's the bit that's doing very well,'' said Michael Godliman, a director with Verdict Research, a consulting group here.</p>
        <p>Investors apparently agreed. Kingfisher shares, which fell more than 6 percent on the news of the breakup, rebounded to close in London with a 5.3 percent gain, at $:4.775, or $6.73.</p>
        <p>For the Woolworth store brand, however, the breakup is an indignity, merely the latest in a series of retreats that resulted in the near-disappearance of the famous name in the United States -- the long shadow of the Woolworth Building in Manhattan aside. The spread of discount stores, and later the huge, specialized ''category killers,'' made the Woolworth five-and-dime format obsolete, a relic of retailing. Remnants of it were repackaged into the Venator Group, but even those stores would be closed.</p>
        <p>Yet in Britain, the Woolworth chain, which was founded by the same Frank W. Woolworth, has managed to live on. The first British Woolworth opened on Nov. 5, 1909, on Church Street in Liverpool. The stores, selling everything from ladies' gloves to confectionery for less than a dime, numbered 768 by the outset of World War II.</p>
        <p>By the 1970's, Woolworth, in disarray, was bought by a London-based consortium, which closed 200 stores and revitalized the rest. By the mid-80's, the company was expanding, purchasing Comet, a British electronics retailer, in 1984, and Superdrug, a cut-price chain, three years later. The transformation was complete in 1989, when the company changed its name to Kingfisher. Woolworth continued to thrive for the next eight years.</p>
        <p>''Woolworth's has managed to survive because Britain hasn't had a tradition of discount stores,'' Mr. Godliman said, ''and so it didn't have a lot of competition.''</p>
        <p>Today, discounting is coming to this country with a vengeance. Stores like Matalan, modeled on Wal-Mart, are booming. Wal-Mart itself has opened a supercenter and has bought the British supermarket chain Asda. All the while, the Internet is taking an increased share of Woolworth's music, video and book businesses.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, Woolworth is feeling the bite. For the six-month period ending on July 29, its profit declined 40 percent, to $:10 million, or about $14.1 million, on sales of $:735 million. The business that begot Kingfisher accounts today for just 4 percent of the company's overall profit and 14 percent of its sales.</p>
        <p>Still, British Woolworth, unwilling to go the way of its moribund American relative, keeps trying to modernize. It is opening general stores that sell food. And a Big W format, 10 times the size of a typical store, is seeking to compete with supercenters.</p>
        <p>''They will have to reconfigure what Woolworth's means in the 21st century,'' Mr. Godliman said.</p>
