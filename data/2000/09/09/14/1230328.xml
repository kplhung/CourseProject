        <p>Scarlet rose petals mark the sidewalk in front of BoHoCo (below right), a home furnishings shop on one of SoHo's quietest streets, and stone lions flank the door. ''Crosby Street is not a busy, busy street,'' said Jacqueline Hewitt, an owner of the store, whose acronym stands for Bohemian Home Colonial. Exoticism, as a style of decor, is crucial here. Except for the lions, which are new and were carved in America, everything is imported in the two-story, 1,000-square-foot shop, fragrant with incense. A late 19th century Chinese rickshaw ($25,000, above) idles behind a bed draped with a 16-foot antique magenta sari ($550); on the bed is an Indian beaded patchwork pillow ($185). Saris are also sold as tablecloths and, for one couple's wedding, a runner for the aisle. From France, a new gilded wood chandelier, above, is 5 by 4 1/4 feet ($2,500). And from Dubai, there are velvet doorstops, designed as poufs holding desert sand and topped by brass-tipped glass knobs. The poufs come in various sizes, including 4 inches high and 5 3/4 inches across, and 5 1/2 inches high and 8 1/2 inches across; they are $100 to $130. BoHoCo is at 91 Crosby Street (near Prince Street); (212) 431-4304.</p>
