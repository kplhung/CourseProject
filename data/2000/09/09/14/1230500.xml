        <p>Nassau County, NY, Legislature's budget director, Mark Young, outlines $90 million worth of new revenues and budget cuts for 2001 agreed to by legislative leaders and County Exec Thomas S Gulotta; plan includes 4 percent rise in property taxes to yield $20 million (M)</p>

        <p>Nassau County residents would pay more property taxes next year under a budget plan being considered by the County Legislature, but they  would see more uniformed police officers out on street patrol, instead of working desk jobs.</p>
        <p>Stays in county hotels and motels would be more expensive. Roughly 23,000 Medicaid patients would be moved into managed care programs. The county would receive more federal funds by housing up to 150 federal prisoners in the county jail in East Meadow. And the average share of a parent's costs for county-subsidized day care would increase by 7 percent.</p>
        <p>Those are some of the preliminary details emerging as officials hammer out a 2001 budget plan and stave off a state takeover of the county's finances. County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta is required to present a balanced budget proposal by Friday.</p>
        <p>County officials have agreed to about $90 million of roughly $140 million in budget cuts and new revenues needed to balance next year's budget, so even some of the items they have agreed to could still fall through, including the proposed tax increases.</p>
        <p>''I would say that these initiatives are very solid,'' said Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic presiding officer of the County Legislature. ''But I can't sign an item in blood that my 10 people will support without deviation.'' The Democrats have a 10-9 majority in the Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mark Young, the Legislature's director of budget and finance, today outlined the $90 million worth of new revenues and budget cuts agreed to by legislative leaders and Mr. Gulotta.</p>
        <p>A little more than half of the actions come from the latest budget plan Mr. Gulotta released on Sept. 5, he said, and the rest from initiatives agreed upon by top officials in June.</p>
        <p>Among the new initiatives is Mr. Gulotta's 4 percent increase in property taxes that would generate $20 million in new revenue a year. A list of smaller issues involving law enforcement, health, labor and taxes make up about $30 million more.</p>
        <p>Among the smaller items are $7.5 million in savings by eliminating county police overtime and sending uniformed officers to street duty. The entire force would shrink from 3,100 to 2,800, officials said.</p>
        <p>''We are looking for ways to make the department more effective,'' said  Gary DelaRaba, the president of the 2,100-member Nassau Police Benevolent Association.</p>
        <p>The county would gain $3.3 million in revenue from housing the federal prisoners; $2.6 million in state aid for social services; and $1.9 million by increasing the tax on hotel and motel stays. It would save $4.6 million by changing the way it pays back early retirement money, and $2.8 million by enrolling Medicaid patients in managed care programs.</p>
        <p>Over the summer, officials identified about $50 million worth of budget cuts and new revenue for 2001. They include saving $15.9 million  through a hiring freeze; $7.3 million by eliminating certain social service contracts; $4.9 million through slashing police overtime; and $2.8 million by eliminating 59 county positions.</p>
        <p>The County Legislature is asking for more details on about $50 million worth of items. They include Mr. Gulotta's contract proposals for the county police, county detectives and county corrections officers and a cost analysis of the double-digit raises he is seeking for the officers.</p>
        <p>The Legislature also wants more detail on the effect of Mr. Gulotta's plan to lay off more than 350 county employees to save $11 million, and about the effect of the early retirements of 319 others.</p>
        <p>It also considers risky Mr. Gulotta's proposal to freeze a subsidy for Long Island Bus service at about $7 million.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, it is a big concern in terms of the numbers of people who rely on bus service,'' said Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, the county's Democratic chairman.</p>
        <p>County officials said it would be impossible to evaluate the plan until  the full details emerged.</p>
        <p>''The full picture will be seen in the balance of the items that haven't been submitted yet,'' said Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican minority leader of the County Legislature. ''We have been given no details on the impact of early retirements, layoffs, union concessions. They are big ticket items that drive solutions to which we have yet to see answers. It's now down to crunch time, and we all await Friday.''</p>
