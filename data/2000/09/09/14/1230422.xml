        <p>U.S. Delays Punitive Duties On European Luxury Goods  President Clinton has delayed punitive duties on European luxury goods, including Scottish cashmere, British shortbread and Italian pecorino cheese, because Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain has shown ''unprecedented'' support for the American position on two trade disputes, administration officials said.</p>
        <p>The reprieve gives United States trade negotiators some leverage to avoid a head-on collision with Europe in a potentially far more costly trade dispute over tax breaks Washington gives American exporters. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>The Senate cleared the last major hurdle to passing a trade bill with China, and handing President Clinton one of his top remaining foreign policy goals. [A8.]</p>
        <p>Inktomi to Buy Software Developer  Inktomi, which specializes in Internet infrastructure, said that it had agreed to acquire FastForward Networks in a stock swap valued at about $1.3 billion. FastForward, based in San Francisco, has developed software technology for the distribution and management of live broadcasting over the Internet. Shares of Inktomi, which is based in Forest City, Calif., fell $2.25, to $108.75. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Stocks Mixed on Earnings Anxiety  Continued nervousness about earnings left stocks mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 51.05 points, or 0.5 percent, to 11,182.18. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index edged up 2.92 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,484.91, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 44.38 points, or 1.2 percent, to 3,893.89. [C12.]</p>
        <p>Suits Filed Against the Drug Ritalin  Lawyers involved in class-action lawsuits against the tobacco industry, gun makers and health maintenance organizations filed two suits against the widely used drug Ritalin. The suits contend that Novartis Pharmaceuticals, the drug's maker, and the American Psychiatric Association conspired to create a market for Ritalin and expand its use. [A20.]</p>
        <p>Janus Fund Closed to New Investors  Janus Capital closed its flagship Janus Fund to new investors. The company has now closed half of its 16 equity funds. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Breaking Through the Ad Gridlock  For the 2001 model year, which formally begins Oct. 1, automakers will eagerly try to gain attention in an American market more cluttered than ever. Agencies are scrambling to find compelling ways to sell vehicles, like the new Lexus LS 430. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C9.]</p>
        <p>Bank Reform Struggles in Malaysia  Efforts by Malaysia to strengthen its banking system by forcing its 54 financial institutions to merge into just 10 appear to be backfiring, as concerns about government interference revive doubt about the industry's health and the risks of investing in the country. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Current Account Deficit Hits Record  The United States current account deficit, the broadest measure of foreign trade, widened 4.6 percent, to $106.14 billion, in the second quarter, surpassing the earlier record of $101.51 billion set in the previous quarter. [C2.]</p>
        <p>A Decline in Work-Related Injuries Since 1992, the number of work-related injuries and illnesses has fallen 25 percent, translating into at least a $125 billion annual lift for the economy. The decline in injuries reverses a historical pattern: injuries usually rise when unemployment falls because work intensity increases and many inexperienced workers are hired. Alan B. Krueger: Economic Scene. [C2.]</p>
