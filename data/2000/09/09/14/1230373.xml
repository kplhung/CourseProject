        <p>There were no safeguards. Although the facts were clear, no one in the criminal justice system was willing to blow the whistle on the unscrupulous prosecution of an honest cop named Zaher Zahrey.</p>
        <p>High-ranking officials in the Police Department, the Brooklyn district attorney's office and the office of the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District ignored the overwhelming evidence that Mr. Zahrey was innocent. Some exculpatory evidence was deliberately concealed. And cops and prosecutors aggressively sought out and promoted the outrageous lies of a violent predator named Sidney Quick, promising him leniency and providing him with all sorts of favors, including a conjugal visit in prison, in return for his perjured testimony against Detective Zahrey.</p>
        <p>Investigators were even willing to close their eyes to Quick's apparent involvement in a murder, as long as he was willing to testify against Detective Zahrey.</p>
        <p>The question I'm asked most frequently about the Zahrey case is why the Police Department was so anxious to nail this guy. I don't know. Did some higher-up dislike him? Was there pressure to crack down on some cop -- any cop -- in the aftermath of the Mollen commission report? Rumors had circulated among cops about Mr. Zahrey's possible involvement in criminal activity, but as far as I can tell the source of those rumors was never determined. What is known is that the cops out to get Mr. Zahrey, whose nickname was Zack, managed to find a crank, a discredited former police informant, to parrot the rumors.</p>
        <p>The crank's name was Carlos Torres. Torres was a drunk who was known to be utterly unreliable. His own daughter told police he was delusional, that he honestly believed he worked for the F.B.I. and the C.I.A.  Torres had once been arrested when he showed up at a police officer's funeral with a hand grenade.</p>
        <p>Anyone interested in the truth would have turned away from this pathetic individual. But Robert Boyce, then a sergeant in Internal Affairs, used Torres's nutty stories to help launch the official investigation of Detective Zahrey.</p>
        <p>Two things ultimately saved Mr. Zahrey -- the fine work of a fiercely dedicated lawyer named Joel Rudin, and the intelligence and common sense of a jury that could not be swayed by the government's deceit.</p>
        <p>But what happens to those who are falsely targeted by police and prosecutors and who don't have a Joel Rudin to fight for them?</p>
        <p>Mr. Rudin showed beyond any question that the case against Detective Zahrey had been crudely and deliberately manufactured. Every alarm bell in the criminal justice system should have been clanging the very first time anyone heard the tape of Boyce telling Quick, during an interview in Sing Sing Prison: ''If you give me Zack, I'll drive you home.''</p>
        <p>But what we found out, thanks to Mr. Rudin, is that prosecutors in the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, were concerned not with the outlandishness of the offer, but with the fact that Boyce had been so careless as to tape it.</p>
        <p>Assistant District Attorney Theresa Corrigan was asked about the propriety of the Sing Sing tape, in which Boyce told Quick he could have a ''sweet deal'' if he could implicate Detective Zahrey in a crime.</p>
        <p>Under oath, Ms. Corrigan said: ''There wasn't a discussion about proper. I know at some point there was statements about there was nothing wrong with this.''</p>
        <p>But there were discussions in Mr. Hynes's office about why Boyce and a partner, Michael McWilliams, taped so much of their encounter with Quick. Prosecutors made it clear they would have been happier if only the comments damaging to Mr. Zahrey had been taped. And for a while the tape was conveniently ''lost'' by the D.A.'s office, and would have remained buried except for the fact that Quick himself blurted out to federal authorities that he had been taped at Sing Sing.</p>
        <p>What is most frightening about this case is that it is not all that unusual. The use of false testimony from criminal lowlifes to manufacture cases against innocent defendants is far more widespread than most Americans realize. The unusual aspects of this case were the existence of the damning Sing Sing tape, and the fact that the defendant was a cop.</p>
