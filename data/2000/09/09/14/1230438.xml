        <p>The proposed takeover of J. P. Morgan by Chase Manhattan to form the country's third-largest financial services institution is the latest in a series of mergers that have wiped out many of New York City's great banks of the past. Gone as independent banks are Manufacturers Hanover Trust, Bankers Trust and Guaranty Trust. Indeed, some of the great banks survive in name only. Once Chemical took over Chase in 1996, an independent Chase ceased to exist. But Chemical ditched its own name in favor of one that evoked images of Abraham Lincoln's Treasury secretary, after whom Chase Bank was named, and the Rockefeller family. After this latest takeover, an independent J. P. Morgan will also cease to exist, though the merged corporation will be called J. P. Morgan Chase. That sounds more impressive than Chemical.</p>
        <p>As mergers swallow one bank after another, the survivors grow gargantuan. J. P. Morgan Chase rolls the former Chemical, Chase, Manufacturers Hanover and J. P. Morgan banks into one financial goliath controlling more than $650 billion in assets. That leaves it behind only Citigroup and Bank of America. Chase and J. P. Morgan together account for over 90,000 employees and $17 billion in revenue. The reigning theory says banks can survive only as part of global conglomerates that offer corporate customers every conceivable financial product. International markets may accommodate only a few conglomerates. The likely survivors include Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. Standing alone, neither Chase nor J. P. Morgan would make the cut. Together they might.</p>

        <p>As mergers swallow one bank after another, the survivors grow gargantuan. J. P. Morgan Chase rolls the former Chemical, Chase, Manufacturers Hanover and J. P.

        <p>Size may not, however, prove to be a magic elixir. Citigroup, which combined Citibank and Travelers Group two years ago, appears to be doing well. But huge Japanese and European banks have stumbled. Shareholders have a lot to fear if gigantism proves a failure. But the general public does not. There are plenty of banks and securities firms to compete for customers' business. For New York City, the merger threatens to produce layoffs in the short term. But if the merger puts J. P. Morgan Chase on the short list of corporate survivors, it will help keep New York at the center of the financial world.</p>
