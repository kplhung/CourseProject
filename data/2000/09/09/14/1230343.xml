        <p>THERE'S something irresistible about the designs of Alexander Girard, and it's not just the bright colors and the big patterns or the friendly folk influences and toylike motifs.</p>
        <p>The brass, glass-jewel suns for La Fonda del Sol, the Latin-American restaurant that Mr. Girard designed for the Time &amp; Life Building in 1961; the poster-graphic Palio fabric (and over 300 others) that he created for the Herman Miller Furniture Company from 1952 to 1973; and the tropical-travel painted fuselages for Braniff Airlines in 1965: the stuff looks happy.</p>
        <p>That could be the key to its appeal right now -- it looks like news and not nostalgia. It's hot, not cool, at a moment when contemporary taste has settled with a lengthening snore into the industrial safety of mid-20th-century icons like the Eameses or the ironic suavities of fashion: shag-carpeted Los Angeles boutique hotels and the faux-Zen design stores in SoHo and TriBeCa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Girard, who died in 1993, was in love with living and it shows, in designs being newly reissued and in a retrospective of his work, which opened on Tuesday at the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum. It's design that has a face on it, like the folk toys Mr. Girard collected: inviting, eager to share. You want to meet it.</p>
        <p>And for all its playfulness, it's very grown-up, very adult in its issues: the sophistications of going to good restaurants or entertaining at home, the education in seeing other cultures on holiday and knowing that common objects like plates or pillows can make the world personal for anyone.</p>
        <p>The Eameses, American ambassadors of the power of ''good design,'' traversed the globe to promote it. Mr. Girard, known as Sandro, born in New York City in 1907 and raised in Florence, Italy, was a diplomat of the delight in domestic detail. With his wife, Susan Needham Girard, he owned and renovated three houses, including a historic adobe in Santa Fe, N.M.</p>
        <p>''What's really interesting about him is how he integrated fabrics, furniture, graphics, into interior design,'' said Donald Albrecht, curator of the Cooper-Hewitt exhibition. ''It's the ensemble of these things that is really remarkable. And all the rituals of life at home are very important to him: the hearth, the dining table, even how you store -- with elaborate displays of utensils in the kitchen.''</p>
        <p>It's utopia with a street address. ''Art is only art when it is applied to living,'' said the designer, who trained as an architect. He called himself a ''functionalist tempered by frivolity.''</p>
        <p>Like his contemporary the graphic designer Paul Rand, who created the company logo and corporate identity for I.B.M. (the alphabet-blocklike ''Big Blue''), and who also illustrated books for children, Mr. Girard introduced the pleasures of humor and whimsy to the business of design, making them professionally respectable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Girard's savvy lack of cynicism -- his exuberant trademark, you could say -- looks amazingly fresh.</p>
        <p>With his undoctrinal mixture of modern, decorative and naive elements, Mr. Girard practiced an eclecticism now well known to interior designers, but it is a source of discovery for recent collectors of modern design.</p>
        <p>Tom Ford, creative director of Gucci, grew up in Santa Fe, and worked at the Compound, a restaurant that Mr. Girard designed. He was later a friend, and remains a fan. Mr. Ford bought many of the furnishings from the house when Susan Girard died, in 1996. It is hard not to see the influence of Mr. Girard's ''opulent modernism'' in Mr. Ford's fashion work: the clean, jet-set cut and the brash materials.</p>
        <p>''The idea that Modernism is a stark aesthetic is just not true -- people miss a lot of the fun,'' said Richard Wright, a dealer and auctioneer in Chicago, who is assembling a body of designs by Mr. Girard to exhibit in November at the Modernism show at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in New York. Vintage textiles and furniture from a line designed for Herman Miller in 1967 (it lasted a year) have appeared sporadically for sale in the last few years. Herman Miller  for the Home reintroduced nine Girard fabric patterns in 1998. Maharam, a New York fabric showroom, will reintroduce six more in February.</p>
        <p>''The market is starting to open to decoration, and Girard was really blazing the trail there,'' Mr. Wright said. ''He was a master colorist -- wild combinations and patterns. And at his core, he's extremely good with composition. His style of juxtaposing folk art and ethnic objects with a Modernist aesthetic became extremely fashionable, and largely influenced the Eameses' famous house. The feel of that house is very much like Girard. He had already done his residence in Detroit when they were at Cranbrook.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Girard, who was a friend of the Eameses, collaborated with Charles Eames in 1957 on a short film, made in Mexico, on the Day of the Dead. He picture-edited the couple's photographs, helping choose the images for their House of Cards playing-card toy. The couples spent Christmases together.</p>
        <p>''Christmas must have been maddening,'' Mr. Albrecht said. ''While they're trying to eat dinner, Charles and Ray are running around photographing the Girards' beautifully set dinner table. 'Charles, sit. Eat.' ''</p>
        <p>In 1932, Mr. Girard returned to New York from Italy, as a young architect. His second office, in Detroit, where he moved in search of work in 1937, brought him to the attention of John Entenza, the editor of the influential Arts and Architecture magazine. Mr. Girard was introduced to Eliel and Eero Saarinen, the architects, at Cranbrook Academy, where he also met the Eameses.</p>
        <p>In 1949, Mr. Girard was asked to choose the 3,200 objects for the Detroit Institute of Art's exhibition ''For Modern Living,'' a showcase promoting accessible, affordable design for postwar Middle America, and the precursor of the Museum of Modern Art's ''Good Design'' shows in New York, which Mr. Girard also worked on in the early 1950's.</p>
        <p>In 1951, recommended by Charles Eames and George Nelson, both frustrated by the lack of modern textile designs available for upholstering their furniture, Mr. Girard was asked by D. J. De Pree, the chief executive of the Herman Miller Furniture Company, to design fabrics. A textiles division, which Mr. Girard headed, was created the next year.</p>
        <p>It is hard to understand how color could create so much excitement, or controversy -- though the present historical moment in design, dominated by unprepossessing shades of brown and gray, could help explain the reaction to Mr. Girard's work.</p>
        <p>''That was a time when people got fainting fits if they saw bright red,'' he said in an interview in 1983, speaking of the 1950's. Mr. Girard's vivid, ''untasteful'' blues, magentas, yellows and reds broke with the prevailing polite tradition of deadened ochres and turquoises popular in interior design.</p>
        <p>''He's really anticipating the 60's and 70's, and Op and Pop Art,'' Mr. Albrecht said of the designer's use of color and pattern, even in black-and-white schemes, which he employed with an eye-catching exaggeration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Girard's most important residential commission, interiors for Mr. and Mrs. J. Irwin Miller's house in Columbus, Ind., in 1955, displayed his talents on a large scale. The designer collaborated with the architects Eero Saarinen and Kevin Roche, and the landscape designer Dan Kiley, to create broad, interior vistas and living spaces with four distinct, color-sensitive seasons of furnishings, including rugs, draperies, upholsteries, and storage units. There are greens in the spring; fire reds in the winter.</p>
        <p>''He was the outstanding innovator of color of his particular time,'' Mr. Miller said in a telephone conversation last week. ''Mrs. Miller said to Eero, 'I don't want to live in the same house all my life.' He said, 'We've built you a neutral house, that can be changed.' It was very much influenced by Sandro.''</p>
        <p>The Miller residence also includes Mr. Girard's inadvertent signature in the evolution of the living room: the conversation pit. The low ceiling height in the house was predicated upon acoustics and the Millers' love of music. The designer suggested sinking the central seating group, rather than disrupting the striking  horizontal lines of the architecture's open plan with sofas.</p>
        <p>''We constructed a model of it at a shop in New York,'' Mr. Miller recalled. ''We sat in it and asked ladies in the shop to walk by, to see if their skirts exposed too much.'' At home, the Millers realized that they had an excellent view of the underside of their piano from the pit. The designer painted it scarlet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Girard's most memorable commercial commission -- and for many, his most sadly missed -- was La Fonda del Sol, a themed restaurant conceived by Joseph Baum of Restaurant Associates. Mr. Girard was recommended by Philip Johnson, who had created the Four Seasons for Mr. Baum.</p>
        <p>La Fonda del Sol was Mr. Girard's love of folk art -- the joy that it captured and radiated -- put on public display. The staff costumes, designed with Rudi Gernreich, including ponchos embroidered with gold suns; the potterylike place settings; the 80 different matchbooks, with their grinning high-noon faces; and the checkerboard tiles of the open kitchen, with its chefs behind a flaming grill, were like a market day in Mexico, brought in a basket to Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>It was here that it is clearest why the simplicity of folk tradition or craft would engage the empathy of modern design. It is a humanizing lesson, still, for its latest audience.</p>
        <p>The Girards moved to Santa Fe in 1953, to more actively pursue their interest in collecting. Their 100,000 folk art objects, which Mr. Girard referred to as his toys, can now be visited at the International Museum of Folk Art in the Girard Wing.</p>
        <p>The designer was asked in an interview why he collected folk art. Was it inspiration?</p>
        <p>''I saw it as a way to recapture all the wonderful enthusiasm and the spirit of discovery that we experience as children, but generally lose as we grow older,'' he answered.</p>
        <p>It was a way -- design might be another -- of being happy.</p>
