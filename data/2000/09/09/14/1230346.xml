      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Most Brian Wilson fans never expected to see him onstage performing the Beach Boys' groundbreaking 1966 album, ''Pet Sounds,'' from beginning to end. He made the album in isolation after he stopped touring with the Beach Boys, working in the studio oblivious to commercial prospects or to whether the elaborately orchestrated songs could ever be played in concert. Yet there he was on Sunday night at the Jones Beach Theater with a band and orchestra behind him, introducing ''Pet Sounds'' as ''about 40 minutes of really nice music.''</p>
        <p>It was that and more. ''Pet Sounds'' is more touching now than it was in the experimental heyday of 1960's rock. It was the work of a 23-year-old songwriter who was painfully diffident and bursting with ambition at the same time. Mr. Wilson sang about how hard it was to find love, friendship and a kindred soul: ''Every time I get the inspiration to go change things around/No one wants to help me look for places where new things might be found,'' he sang in ''I Just Wasn't Made for These Times.''</p>

        <p>Most Brian Wilson fans never expected to see him onstage performing the Beach Boys' groundbreaking 1966 album, ''Pet Sounds,'' from beginning to end. He made the album in isolation after he stopped touring with the Beach Boys, working in the studio oblivious to commercial prospects or to whether the elaborately orchestrated songs could ever be played in concert. Yet there he was on Sunday night at the Jones Beach Theater with a band and orchestra behind him, introducing ''Pet Sounds'' as ''about 40 minutes of really nice music.''</p>
        <p>It was that and more. ''Pet Sounds'' is more touching now than it was in the experimental heyday of 1960's rock. It was the work of a 23-year-old songwriter who was painfully diffident and bursting with ambition at the same time. Mr. Wilson sang about how hard it was to find love, friendship and a kindred soul: ''Every time I get the inspiration to go change things around/No one wants to help me look for places where new things might be found,'' he sang in ''I Just Wasn't Made for These Times.''</p>
        <p>The tunes don't move steadily like most pop songs; they pause and ruminate in orchestral interludes as if unsure how to continue. But the complex tempo changes, eccentric orchestrations and soaring vocal harmonies are the work of a songwriter who purposely defied the conventions he had already mastered.</p>
        <p>''Pet Sounds'' was part of the second set in a two-part concert that concentrated on Mr. Wilson's 1960's songs. Until the finale, with ebullient early Beach Boys songs like ''I Get Around'' and ''Fun, Fun, Fun,'' many of the songs brought out Mr. Wilson's plaintive side. In ''Until I Die'' and ''In My Room,'' the lyrics confessed to an abiding loneliness while the music created a refuge of overarching harmony. Once Mr. Wilson shared vocal harmonies with his brothers in the Beach Boys; now he shares them with fans onstage and in the audience.</p>
        <p>His voice is not the pure instrument it was. It strains and sometimes misses notes; it has been a long time since the 1960's. Mr. Wilson, famous for stage fright in the past, was not entirely at ease, but he cheerfully introduced most songs and sometimes pointed to his heart or pointed a finger to highlight a favorite passage. Songs like ''Caroline, No,'' ''Don't Talk'' and ''I Know There's an Answer'' took on extra poignancy from the passage of time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson is touring with musicians who are scholars of his music. As on his 1999 tour, the core band is the Wondermints, who are dedicated to recreating lapidary 1960's pop; they took along many of the instruments Mr. Wilson used on ''Pet Sounds,'' including banjo, bass harmonica, bicycle horn, alto flute and tannerin, the instrument actually used on ''Good Vibrations'' and ''I Just Wasn't Made for These Times'' because it is easier to control than the theremin.</p>
        <p>The orchestra cushioned the music with strings and filled in the interludes and unlikely transitions that Mr. Wilson had devised for brass and woodwinds. It also opened the concert with a symphonic medley, arranged by Mr. Wilson's occasional collaborator, Van Dyke Parks, that strung together well-known and obscure Beach Boys songs as a kind of lost Hollywood epic. Sometimes it teased out inner voices, and sometimes it unfurled the melodies like grand silhouettes against a Southern California sunset.</p>
