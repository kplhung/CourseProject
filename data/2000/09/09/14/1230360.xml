        <p>Additions</p>
        <p>They include works by Rembrandt, Arthur Wesley Dow, Picasso and Jasper Johns. They are among the important acquisitions of the Cleveland Museum of Art in the six years since its last exhibition of recently acquired prints. Beginning on Sunday more than 100 examples will be shown through Nov. 26 in ''From Rembrandt to Rauschenberg: Recently Acquired Prints.'' Executed around 1654, Rembrandt's ''Presentation of the Temple in the Dark Manner,'' an etching, drypoint and engraving, epitomizes his  use of light to symbolize divinity.</p>
        <p>New Guard</p>
        <p>Hans Graf is to succeed Christoph Eschenbach as music director of the Houston Symphony. Mr. Graf, director of the Salzburg Mozarteum Orchestra from 1984 to 1994, is to begin his five-year tenure in the 2001-2002 season. He has been music director of the Calgary Symphony since 1995 and of the Orchestre National Bordeaux Aquitaine since 1998. The Houston Symphony began its search for a new music director in 1997 when Mr. Eschenbach said he would step down to spend more time in Europe. During his 11-year tenure, he was credited with raising performance standards, and recently has been mentioned as a contender for the directorship of the New York Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>On the Road</p>
        <p>There are many jokes about getting to Carnegie Hall, but one of the truths is that the hall also comes to the people. At 2 p.m. on Saturday it will celebrate the 25th season of its free Neighborhood Concerts Series with a special event at the World Financial Center Plaza on West Street, between Liberty and Vesey Streets. Expected to last nearly four hours rain or shine (the rain site is the neighboring Wintergarden), the concert's diverse performers will include the American Brass Orchestra, the vocalist David Gurland, the guitarist Eliot Fisk, the Leonore String Quartet and the Flying Neutrinos swing ensemble. Beginning next month, the series will take 20 concerts to Brooklyn, 19 to Manhattan, 17 to Queens, 16 to the Bronx and 5 to Staten Island.</p>
        <p>Fortunetelling</p>
        <p>In 15th-century northern Italy, members of the nobility were taken with a trump card game played with cards called trionfi, which depicted allegorical images and often the heraldic devices of the Visconti and Sforza families. By the late 18th century such cards, now called tarot, with images of death and the Devil and astrological references, were being used to tell fortunes. Beginning on Saturday tarot cards and related rare books will be on view through Nov. 26 in ''Symbolism and Prophecy: The World of Tarot From the Renaissance to the Present'' at the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
