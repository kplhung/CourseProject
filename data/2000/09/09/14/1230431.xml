        <p>Intensifying the pressure on Jon S. Corzine to disclose more about his personal finances, the New Jersey Republican chairman asked the Internal Revenue Service today to compel Mr. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, to reveal which groups received millions of dollars from his private foundation last year.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in the State House, the Republican chairman, Chuck Haytaian, questioned whether Mr. Corzine was using his foundation, to which he gave nearly $9 million last year, to buy political support in turn from leaders of nonprofit groups -- an allegation Mr. Corzine has repeatedly denied.</p>
        <p>''If the foundation is being used as a political slush fund, that's illegal,'' said Mr. Haytaian, who ran for the Senate himself in 1994 and is now supporting Mr. Corzine's Republican opponent, Representative Bob Franks. Mr. Haytaian said he had no evidence that Mr. Corzine had done anything improper, but called on the Democrat to prove it by releasing his foundation's 1999 tax return.</p>
        <p>''Show me the forms,'' Mr. Haytaian said. ''Show me the forms and then I'll know, but it certainly raises questions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's charity, the Jon and Joanne Corzine Foundation, was scheduled to have filed its annual tax return with the I.R.S. by June 15, but it sought and received a 90-day extension. On Monday, a spokesman, Tom Shea, said Mr. Corzine had requested a second delay, until Dec. 15. The return that is due covers the 12-month period that ended Jan. 31.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shea said Mr. Corzine asked for the extension in part because he hired a new accountant last year after retiring as co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company. More important, he said, Mr. Corzine gave much more to charity in 1999 than in prior years, making the return much more complicated. Mr. Corzine has said that all told, he claimed $14.5 million in charitable contributions last year, compared with $3.5 million in 1998. Mr. Corzine has said he gave $8.9 million of that money to the foundation last year.</p>
        <p>Experts on philanthropies said it would be possible for Mr. Corzine to resolve most questions about the beneficiaries of his foundation by simply releasing a copy of its check register.</p>
        <p>''There's no reason, to my knowledge, why he couldn't release the grants that he's made,'' said Dan Langan, a longtime charity watchdog in New York. ''That's not why you get an extension. You do know what you've done during the year, what you've given and to whom.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shea said late today that he would ask Mr. Corzine's accountant and lawyers about the possibility of releasing a check register. But he dismissed Mr. Haytaian's letter to the I.R.S. as a political stunt.</p>
        <p>''I think the I.R.S. will be governed by federal law and federal rules and regulations, not by what Chuck Haytaian thinks they should do,'' Mr. Shea said.</p>
        <p>An I.R.S. spokesman, Don Roberts, said that he could not discuss communications between the agency and any tax return filer, but that requests for extensions generally required judgment calls. ''It has to be a good enough reason,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shea said he found it ''incredible that Bob Franks is attacking Jon Corzine for giving $14 million to charity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Shea added, ''I also don't understand the logic of their argument. Jon Corzine makes charitable contributions, and he makes political contributions. The two are entirely separate. If they want to know what political contributions Jon Corzine makes, they can look at his F.E.C. report.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's reports to the Federal Election Commission show that his campaign gave nearly $85,000 to groups representing labor, business, women, minorities and others, and more than $650,000 to political candidates and committees across New Jersey, as of June 30.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Haytaian and aides to Mr. Franks said Mr. Corzine's foundation could have given money to nonprofit groups with political affiliates or allies in exchange for endorsements. By way of example, he mentioned the Sierra Club, whose New Jersey chapter endorsed Mr. Corzine a week ago. It had faulted Mr. Franks for his record on water quality, wetlands protection and suburban sprawl.</p>
        <p>It was a poor choice of examples, however: the chapter's director, Jeff Tittel, was passing by the news conference and stepped in to declare that Mr. Corzine had ''never given us a dime.''</p>
        <p>In any case, the request for an extension gave Mr. Franks, who has increasingly made an issue of what he contends is Mr. Corzine's lack of candor regarding his finances and other matters, an opening for another attack in the news media at a time when only Mr. Corzine is able to afford television commercials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, a four-term congressman, also continues to call on Mr. Corzine to release his personal tax returns. He argues that since most of the $35 million that Mr. Corzine has spent on his campaign came from his own pocket, the only way to comply with the spirit of the campaign finance laws is to make the fullest financial disclosure possible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has long insisted that he is prevented from doing so by a confidentiality pact with Goldman Sachs, in an arrangement so secret that he is barred from producing a copy of the agreement itself.</p>
        <p>But the pact did not prevent his spokesman from responding to Mr. Franks's speculation that Mr. Corzine had paid no New Jersey state income taxes.</p>
        <p>''The Franks campaign and their surrogates have never let the fact that they don't have the facts stand in their way in attacking Jon Corzine,'' Mr. Shea said. He said Mr. Corzine paid $1.9 million in taxes to New Jersey in 1999, including an advance payment of about $270,000 for this year. And for 1996 through 1998, he paid the state $875,000, $673,000 and $1.12 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shea has also said recently that after Dec. 31, Mr. Corzine would be freed from the confidentiality agreement -- up to a point. ''It means that he can release his tax returns from that point on,'' Mr. Shea said. ''But not from before the end of the year 2000.''</p>
        <p>Told of that, Mr. Franks's spokesman, Charlie Smith, responded scornfully: ''What's that response --  'I think public disclosure's a good idea, but in the future'? Public disclosure's either a concept you agree with, or you try to avoid.''</p>
