        <p>Britain said the number of unemployed fell to a 25-year low of 3.6 percent in August from 3.7 percent in July as a further 18,000 people found work. The figures reflect the contrast between Britain and continental Europe, where the average unemployment rate is almost three times as high, but the fall is causing problems for manufacturers unable to find skilled workers. Other figures showed wage increases also fell in the three months through July to an annualized 3.9 percent, down from 4.1 percent in the previous quarter, reducing worries about the likely impact of inflation on interest rates.</p>
