        <p>Who will be next?</p>
        <p>That was the question being asked on Wall Street yesterday after Chase Manhattan announced it would buy J. P. Morgan &amp; Company for $30.9 billion. As with squads of teenagers huddled in the gym bleachers at a high school dance, the gossip was endless. Midsize firms, like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, will be the next to pair up with larger rivals, traders said. Merrill Lynch, a perennial takeover candidate, surely could not survive on its own. Even powerhouses like the Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter were considered vulnerable.</p>

        <p>Who will be next?</p>
        <p>That was the question being asked on Wall Street yesterday after Chase Manhattan announced it would buy J. P. Morgan &amp; Company for $30.9 billion. As with squads of teenagers huddled in the gym bleachers at a high school dance, the gossip was endless. Midsize firms, like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, will be the next to pair up with larger rivals, traders said. Merrill Lynch, a perennial takeover candidate, surely could not survive on its own. Even powerhouses like the Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter were considered vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Such talk is a ritual the day a big merger is announced and, usually, the gossip is just that. ''The market is evolving,'' said Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, a New York advisory firm. ''No one really knows what is going to happen.'' Still, he added, the industry is changing and investors and corporate clients alike could benefit from that.</p>
        <p>''Instead of having the top three players,'' Mr. Burnett said, referring to the large investment banks of Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, ''we are going to have a top six or seven.'' With that comes more competition. ''Why pay $30 million in fees for a banker when you can pay less?'' he added. ''There is room for improvement.''</p>
        <p>One reason Wall Street firms are merging is to dominate in the lucrative global merger advisory business, as well as lead in stock and bond offerings. That is one reason Credit Suisse First Boston agreed to acquire Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette for $11.5 billion two weeks ago. In July, UBS A.G. said it would buy PaineWebber for $10 billion.</p>
        <p>But not every firm offers the same benefit. Henry McVey, a securities and banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, said a competitor might buy Lehman Brothers, for instance, to increase its presence in Europe. Nearly half of Lehman's revenue is from outside the United States, he said. Bear Stearns, for its part, earns much of its revenue processing trades and providing capital for smaller Wall Street firms.</p>
        <p>''It is becoming a scale game,'' Mr. McVey said. ''The bigger the better.''</p>
        <p>Investment banks are feeling pressure to grow, in part because they market their expertise using so-called league tables that rank how active they are in merger advice, initial public offerings and other investment banking services. But being involved in a high-profile transaction does not always guarantee big profits. J. P. Morgan, for instance, advised the Exxon Corporation in its merger with Mobil Corporation but was paid a paltry $8 million. For a deal that size, investment bankers can make five times that. But in the Exxon-Mobil merger, most of the details were worked out between the chief executives, not bankers.</p>
        <p>As such, league tables are more about bragging rights than a sign of how profitable a firm can be. ''The beauty contests are driven by who is No. 1,'' Mr. Burnett said, referring to the presentations investment banks make to win a client's business.</p>
        <p>But one risk few people consider until after a Wall Street merger is announced is how well the culture of any two firms will mesh. When Credit Suisse announced two weeks ago that it was buying Donaldson, tongues wagged about whether the collegial and almost clubby Donaldson bankers would thrive at Credit Suisse, where bankers are said to have sharper elbows. In fact, some Credit Suisse bankers at the time privately complained that they would be hard pressed to report to their new colleagues at Donaldson.</p>
        <p>''One thing we've learned from the Salomon Smith Barney merger is that integration is difficult,'' Mr. McVey said, referring to the merger of Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney. ''There is the vision and the integration, and the two can be at odds.''</p>
