        <p>Moments after e-mail messages went out to tens of thousands of employees of Chase Manhattan and J. P. Morgan yesterday morning announcing a proposed union of the two companies, Fritz Georges was one of the few willing to discuss publicly what many preferred remain private.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is a little concerned,'' Mr. Georges said as he leaned against his black sedan outside J. P. Morgan's headquarters at 60 Wall Street, where he works as a driver for executives. ''They don't know who is going to be next, who is on the line.''</p>
        <p>As company officials announced their plan for Chase Manhattan to acquire J. P. Morgan for more than $30 billion, some industry analysts speculated that the merged company could shed as many as 10,000 employees. Company executives, who declined to discuss specific numbers, acknowledged that they had several duplicate areas of business, as well as buildings and support services, that could be eliminated. But they said their target was to save about $500 million in employment costs, suggesting that cuts were likely to involve no more than a few thousand people.</p>
        <p>The combined company, to be called J. P. Morgan Chase, would have about 100,000 employees worldwide, with roughly 18,000 based in New York, where both companies have their headquarters. Several thousand Chase employees in Manhattan are scheduled to move into a 45-story tower planned for Jersey City in the next few years.</p>
        <p>''Whenever you have two giants, you are going to have a lot of people with the same job titles,'' said Gary Goldstein, president of the Whitney Group, a recruiting company.</p>
        <p>To increase efficiency, Chase and J. P. Morgan will probably move quickly to cut jobs, the analysts said. Generally, the acquired company is the one that loses the most jobs, but analysts say it is unclear how that will play out, given J. P. Morgan's strengths.</p>
        <p>As far as Mr. Georges was concerned, however, Chase, as the acquiring bank, can be expected to impose most of the cuts on J. P. Morgan employees. ''There is an old saying that goes, 'Every new current carries its own fish,' '' he said. ''People are worried.''</p>
        <p>Jon Diat, a Chase Manhattan spokesman, declined to comment in detail about potential layoffs. Company officials said the merger could be completed by the first quarter of next year.</p>
        <p>''This transaction is about growth,'' Mr. Diat said. ''There is obviously some overlap between the two organizations. However, there should be a smaller percentage of job loss in New York City than in other mergers.''</p>
        <p>In an e-mail message to employees, William B. Harrison, Chase's chief executive, was a bit more candid. ''Our merger is all about growth, but it will also provide opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce expenses,'' he wrote. ''We expect savings from combining facilities and systems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison added that each employee would be given consideration based on merits. ''Where there are overlapping jobs, some positions may need to be eliminated,'' he said. ''Any decisions will be made fairly and objectively on a case-by-case basis.''</p>
        <p>In 1991, the merger of Chemical Bank and the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation eliminated more than 6,000 jobs. In 1995, Chemical's acquisition of Chase led to the elimination of even more jobs.</p>
        <p>But unlike those mergers, this deal involves two banks that complement each other more than they overlap. Chase has been a full-service bank, weakest in investment banking, while J. P. Morgan focused on raising capital for top-tier corporations and managing the wealth of the monied elite.</p>
        <p>''There is some natural benefit because they have different strengths,'' said Mitchell Moss, a professor at New York University.</p>
        <p>By contrast, when Chase and Chemical combined, it was the union of two companies with large commercial bank operations.</p>
        <p>But those caveats did not allay employees' concerns. Members of the banks' support staffs are vulnerable, while investment banking units with overlapping corporate managers, stock analysts and Chase's European operations probably face layoffs, analysts said. Chase's retail banking division, which has no counterpart at Morgan, is unlikely to be affected.</p>
        <p>From investment bankers to data processors and executive secretaries, the mood outside the Manhattan offices of both companies was skittish, even as most reassured themselves that in view of the strong economy and healthy demand for talent, they could manage a soft landing even if the worst happened.</p>
        <p>''Uncertainty, that's the key word,'' said one recently hired J. P. Morgan investment banker. ''Especially in areas like foreign exchange and derivatives, where there is a lot of overlap.''</p>
        <p>Based on conversations he had in the weeks before the planned deal was announced, Mr Georges said ''the secretaries of the big shots seem the most concerned.''</p>
        <p>''They know,'' he explained, ''if their bosses go, they are the next to go.''  BANKING'S BIG DEAL: THE EMPLOYEES</p>
