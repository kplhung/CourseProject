        <p>Ms. Smiley suggests that contemporary Americans conceive of marriage as an arena for maximizing their own individual happiness. This logic is precisely the problem: most divorcing parents think primarily of their own happiness, minimizing or denying the repercussions their children may suffer.</p>

        <p>Re ''There They Go, Bad-Mouthing Divorce Again,'' by Jane Smiley (Op-Ed, Sept. 12):</p>
        <p>Ms. Smiley suggests that contemporary Americans conceive of marriage as an arena for maximizing their own individual happiness. This logic is precisely the problem: most divorcing parents think primarily of their own happiness, minimizing or denying the repercussions their children may suffer.</p>
        <p>Of course, abusive and alcoholic couples should split up, but those are a small minority of marriages. With the contemporary divorce culture's permission, too many parents are saying their happiness is more important than their children's well-being, a breathtaking example of America's moral decline.</p>
