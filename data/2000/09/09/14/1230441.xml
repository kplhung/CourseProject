        <p>They say that anything can happen in the Second Congressional District on Long Island, and after Tuesday's tumultuous primaries, this year is proving no exception.</p>
        <p>Back in 1974, voters there made Thomas Downey, who barely met the constitutional age requirement of 25, the third-youngest person ever elected to the House of Representatives; a Democrat in a district with a Republican edge. They kept him in office 18 years, then dumped him in 1992 for another upstart, Rick A. Lazio, a Republican.</p>
        <p>And now, after Mr. Lazio's run for the Senate provoked a mad scramble for his seat, Tuesday's results pose an intriguing question for the November election: Will the district -- whose population is overwhelmingly white -- make history by electing the first Republican black woman ever to serve in the House?</p>
        <p>The candidate is Joan B. Johnson, who made a big step toward that goal by winning the Republican primary.</p>
        <p>But the rest of the results were mixed for her. Her challenger, Robert T. Walsh, pulled 39 percent of the vote to her 61 percent, and will seek to chip away at the Republican base vote in November by remaining on the ballot as the Right to Life candidate. And she lost the Conservative Party primary to Richard N. Thompson, 54 percent to 46 percent.</p>
        <p>Since 1991, Ms. Johnson, 66, a former teacher, has been the town clerk of Islip, which constitutes 51 percent of the Congressional district. In the last town election she led the ticket.</p>
        <p>But now she faces an energetic Democratic candidate, Steven B. Israel, 42. As the Democratic majority leader of the Huntington Town Board, Mr. Israel says he helped solve that town's fiscal crisis and cut taxes. But he barely won his own party's primary on Tuesday, defeating David A. Bishop by about 400 votes out of 13,000 cast. Their contest was bitter, but Mr. Israel said he was encouraged by Mr. Bishop's pledge of support.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Bishop's name remains on the ballot as the candidate of the Independence, Working Families and Green Parties. There are ways to give the endorsements to Mr. Israel, but only if those parties agree.</p>
        <p>The Second District is anchored in the blue-collar, middle-class suburbs of western Suffolk's South Shore. Ms. Johnson takes heart in its Republican enrollment of 120,000, as compared with a Democratic roll of 95,000. But enrollment figures can be deceptive. President Clinton defeated Bob Dole four years ago, 55 percent to 35 percent. At the same time, Mr. Lazio vanquished his Democratic rival by a better than 2-to-1 margin.</p>
        <p>Race can be a double-edged issue.  Ms. Johnson hopes for a crossover vote of blacks and women who usually favor Democrats. But there is also a potential for a surprise, said a political consultant who has worked for both parties, Alan Eysen. He pointed to David N. Dinkins, whose polling numbers when he ran for mayor in New York City did not hold up when people stepped into the privacy of the voting booth.</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Johnson and Mr. Israel are trying to raise big campaign funds, with help from their national parties, who see the Second as a swing district that will help decide which party controls Congress.</p>
        <p>''It's a real flip-flop district,'' Mr. Eysen said. ''The pollsters are going to have a lot of fun with that one.''</p>
