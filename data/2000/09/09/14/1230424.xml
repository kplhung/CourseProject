        <p>Standing in front of his locker after the game yesterday, Mets catcher Mike Piazza did not look frustrated or fatigued, symptoms that could be expected as the season winds down. And he seemed more amused than angered by his troubles.</p>
        <p>Piazza struck out four times in four at-bats yesterday, swinging every time. He came up empty three times against the Milwaukee starter, Jeff D'Amico, and then in the bottom of the ninth inning, with the tying run on third base and one out, he went down swinging against reliever Curtis Leskanic, twice flailing at pitches far out of the strike zone.</p>

        <p>Standing in front of his locker after the game yesterday, Mets catcher Mike Piazza did not look frustrated or fatigued, symptoms that could be expected as the season winds down. And he seemed more amused than angered by his troubles.</p>
        <p>Piazza struck out four times in four at-bats yesterday, swinging every time. He came up empty three times against the Milwaukee starter, Jeff D'Amico, and then in the bottom of the ninth inning, with the tying run on third base and one out, he went down swinging against reliever Curtis Leskanic, twice flailing at pitches far out of the strike zone.</p>
        <p>This was only the most recent of Piazza's struggles, if not the most painful to watch. He has batted just .176 (6 for 34) in September. After the Mets pulled out a 4-1 victory in 10 innings against the Brewers yesterday, he was asked if he was worn down by the rigors of catching 110 games this season.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' Piazza said. ''Right now, I'm kind of numb. It's just frustrating. You go through times when you don't swing the bat well. You've got to suck it up. That's part of the game. It's tough, not just for myself, but for us as a ball club.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to quit. I've got to  keep battling. You take your hat off to the pitchers. They're making good pitches, exploiting your weaknesses. I've got to get back to taking good swings and not swinging at bad pitches. There's not really a secret formula to it. It takes time. You've got to crawl before you walk and walk before you run.''</p>
        <p>A walk would have been a revelation for Piazza, who has done little to support his bid for Most Valuable Player honors. He is still batting .329 with 34 home runs and 103 runs batted in for the season, but in nine September starts he has just one home run and two R.B.I. Still, with three victories in their last four games to end the homestand, the Mets were able to overcome Piazza's difficulties. After Piazza struck out in the ninth inning yesterday, Robin Ventura shook off his own season-long batting slump to line a run-scoring double into the left-field corner, easing Piazza's mind. Ventura said that he was pleased to be able to pick up Piazza, who carried the team through most of the season.</p>
        <p>''All's forgotten,'' Piazza said, laughing at Ventura's words. ''Obviously, he picked me up.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I swung the bat very poorly. I really try to avoid thinking that there is pressure on me to carry the team. Consciously, I try to put it out of my mind, but maybe in the back of my mind it's there. The bottom line is the win now. Todd Zeile came up to me on the bench after, I forget which strikeout, and said: 'That's what we're supposed to do. You're obviously struggling now. You've picked us up the whole year. It's kind of a handing-the-baton type of thing, at least until you get a little bit of a run back.'</p>
        <p>''I know that you've got to be confident. It's definitely going to come back. You go back to good fundamentals. In the meantime, it's nice to know that guys see that. It's not a question of, 'Mike's not swinging well, so we're in trouble.' It's like, 'Mike's not swinging well, so I want to help the team.' Maybe today was a good sign of that.''</p>
        <p>Piazza recalled that his only other four-strikeout game came at the hands of Jeff Fassero, but he couldn't remember when. (It was July 5, 1994, when Piazza was with Los Angeles and Fassero was with Montreal.) But he was trying hard to forget this one while trying to figure out why it had happened.</p>
        <p>''I wish I knew,'' he said. ''I just basically stink. There's not much to it. When you're swinging well, it's easy. Now is the time I've got to battle. I've been through it before; a lot of guys have. I'm going to keep going up there, keep trying to do whatever I can to help this team win. I just hope I hit bottom today and can bounce back. It can't really get any worse.''</p>
        <p>Piazza paused for a moment and then added: ''I don't want to say that. It's just part of the game. It's not the time to quit. I'm going to keep going out there and I've got to battle because that's what it's all about.''</p>
