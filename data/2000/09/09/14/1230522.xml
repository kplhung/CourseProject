        <p>An airborne jet carrying Pakistan's military ruler and 120 other people returned to Kennedy International Airport last night because of a bomb threat, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said.</p>
        <p>The plane, Pakistan International Airlines Flight 722, had been searched by three teams of bomb-sniffing dogs before takeoff because the Pakistani leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, was on board, said Alan Hicks, a Port Authority spokesman.</p>
        <p>When a 911 operator relayed word at 9 p.m. of a bomb threat, the pilot decided the Boeing 747, in line to take off, had been searched thoroughly already and took off anyway, Mr. Hicks said. But over the Boston area, the pilot had second thoughts and returned to Kennedy, Mr. Hicks said. At 1 a.m. today the passengers' luggage was still being searched.</p>
