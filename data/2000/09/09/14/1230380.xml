        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan shocked many nations last year by arguing that leaders who abuse citizens can no longer escape reckoning by hiding behind national sovereignty.

        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan shocked many nations last year by arguing that leaders who abuse citizens can no longer escape reckoning by hiding behind national sovereignty. Now Canada is about to announce that it has asked a panel to write the first concrete guidelines for making the tough calls between human rights and national rights.</p>
        <p>''It's probably the most important debate that we face at this juncture,'' Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said today. In an interview, he said the divide between those who say prominence should be given to international standards of human rights and those who hold to ''more classic nation-state interests'' has widened and sharpened.</p>
        <p>Some, but not all, the nations most strongly opposed to international intervention aimed at saving people -- or sometimes saving democratic institutions -- are in the developing world. There is also a strong lobby in the United States, reflected in the Republican leadership in Congress, against any erosion of the principle of national sovereignty.</p>
        <p>The debate has been impossible to avoid, diplomats say. From the creation of the United Nations in 1945 and throughout the cold war, the protection of national interests was almost inevitably prominent, Mr. Axworthy said, adding: ''Our take has been that since the end of the cold war we have to focus on individuals, on the people. That is as much in the charter as sovereignty.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Axworthy said that a year ago, just after Mr. Annan's groundbreaking speech to the General Assembly, Canada offered to pay for a program within the United Nations to study the legality and the implications of what diplomats call ''humanitarian intervention.''</p>
        <p>''That wasn't considered to be prudent, because there was so much opposition to it by certain countries, as well as within the bureaucracy,'' Mr. Axworthy said. ''It became too controversial.''</p>
        <p>So Canada decided on its own to commission a study, with the help of four American foundations, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Hewlett Foundation in California, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation. Canada is to announce its plans on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Two former foreign ministers, Gareth Evans of Australia and Mohamed A. Sahnoun of Algeria, will be chairmen of the panel, to be called the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty.</p>
        <p>Panel members, not all of who have been chosen, will include Lee H. Hamilton, a former Democratic Congressman from Indiana and member of the House International Relations Committee; Michael Ignatieff, the writer; Legwaila Joseph Legwaila, Botswana's ambassador to the United Nations; Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Russian lower house of Parliament; Cornelius Sommaruga, former president of the International Committee of the Red Cross; and Ramesh Thakur, an Indian who is vice rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Axworthy said the study would look at all types of material like case studies, public opinion surveys and published research to draw up guidelines. ''We hope, to use the buzzword of the day, that this can be a little bit of a tipping agent toward actually getting the adoption of some criteria, some understanding -- maybe simply conventional practice, as opposed to something that's codified in law,'' he said. ''But at least we'll get the debate out there. We'll flush people out and get some serious research.''</p>
