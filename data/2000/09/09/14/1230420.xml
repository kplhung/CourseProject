        <p>The first woman hired as a full-time chef at the White House has filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her boss, the executive pastry chef, and against President Clinton, accusing the president of failing to provide a procedure for filing such a complaint.</p>
        <p>Franette McCulloch, who went to work for the executive pastry chef, Roland Mesnier, in 1983 as assistant pastry chef, claims in her suit that Mr. Mesnier had subjected her to ''severe sexual harassment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is named in the complaint because the head of a federal agency, in this case the White House, is typically named in civil rights suits brought against the agency. The complaint says that he failed to establish a method for White House employees to report civil rights violations, as required by a 1997 law.</p>
        <p>Ms. McCulloch is asking for $1 million from Mr. Mesnier and $1 million from the president in the suit, which was filed yesterday in United States District Court in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mesnier refused to comment on the suit. The White House press secretary, Joe Lockhart, refused to discuss details of the case, but said that all employees were informed of their rights for filing grievances with the equal employment opportunity office at the White House.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Ms. McCulloch said there was no equal employment opportunity office at the White House until recently.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mesnier hired Ms. McCulloch after she completed an apprenticeship with him. Her suit claims Mr. Mesnier began harassing her in 1991 when he told her he was planning to divorce his wife. When she refused his overtures, the suit claims, the harassment escalated, with demands for sex, phone calls to her at home, hostility and abusiveness.</p>
        <p>Over several years, Ms. McCulloch complained to Gary Walters, the chief usher at the White House, who, the suit claims, said he would talk to Mr. Mesnier. This angered Mr. Mesnier, the suit says, and he became more abusive, excluding her from the creative process of dessert planning, and instead assigning her menial tasks like peeling kiwis and cleaning out the refrigerator.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Ms. McCulloch received her first less-than-perfect evaluation, the suit says, claiming that Mr. Mesnier linked the evaluation to ''the little problem we had.''</p>
        <p>The situation became increasingly tense until 1997 when, the suit says, Ms. McCulloch began to see a therapist on a regular basis for stress and depression. In June 1999, Ms. McCulloch, on the advice of a doctor, went on disability leave without pay, the suit says.</p>
