        <p>New ICO, the satellite communications company soon to merge into Craig O. McCaw's ambitious Teledesic satellite venture, announced yesterday that it had reached an agreement with the Hughes Space and Communications Company on plans for Hughes to produce 14 satellites. The agreement includes 3 new satellites and modifications to 11 spacecraft that Hughes had in production when ICO Global Communications, New ICO's predecessor, filed for bankruptcy just over a year ago. Mr. McCaw led a group that brought the company out of bankruptcy for $1.2 billion and forged plans for a satellite system capable of offering a range of data and Internet services in addition to the voice traffic ICO Global had envisioned. The network is now scheduled to begin operations in 2003. Hughes said the satellite design was one of the most complex ever undertaken.</p>
