        <p>IN San Francisco, defensive players apologized to the team and fans on Sunday for falling behind the Carolina Panthers, 14-0, at the end of the first quarter, and 28-0 by the end of the first half. When 49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia was benched in favor of Rick Mirer, as big a bust on the West Coast as he was in the East, Joe Montana must have been considering a comeback.</p>
        <p>The 49ers play St. Louis this week. The Rams might score 50 . . . in one quarter.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the proud Green Bay franchise lost to Buffalo and fell to 0-2 for the first time since 1992. ''There's nothing worse than being 0-2 when you're playing football,'' said Packers offensive tackle Mark Tauscher. Yes, there is: it is being 0-2 and a member of the Dallas Cowboys, a team that was once the most feared franchise in football. On Sunday night in the desert, the Cowboys lost to the Arizona Cardinals. At the end of the game, offensive lineman Larry Allen and safety Darren Woodson threw their helmets in disgust while standing on the sideline.</p>
        <p>They must have thought helmet-tossing was a new Olympic event.</p>
        <p>In recent times, San Francisco, Green Bay and Dallas have been role-model franchises in the National Football League. The 49ers won with Montana, Young and Rice, and the Packers with the arm of Brett Favre, while the Dallas trio of Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin resurrected a winning tradition that was started by Tom Landry.</p>
        <p>The success of these teams, in a way, helped to further glamorize the N.F.L. and bolster pro football's status as the country's most popular professional sport.</p>
        <p>But now the teams that were the toast of the league -- staying on top by manipulating the salary-cap system, massaging it, stretching it, even sometimes abusing it -- are suddenly victims of it, and the punch line of jokes. (Question: How many 49ers does it take to screw in a light bulb? Answer: None, because the team can't fit the cost of electricity under the cap.)</p>
        <p>The 49ers, Packers and Cowboys have won seven of the past 12 Super Bowls, and some of those were captured because these three franchises skillfully worked the salary cap. Now the system is nipping at their heels. For the first time in 40 years, the three teams have started 0-2 in the same season. That is a stunning statistic and a sign that the mighty have truly fallen, choked by the cap.</p>
        <p>The more you beat the $62 million salary cap by spreading out high signing bonuses deep into the future to avoid paying the price now, the more the cap fights back in the long run. Teams give players fat bonuses and low base salaries as a way to temporarily exceed the cap limit, but eventually the back ends of those contracts grow to the point where teams cannot keep other players. The franchise caps out, cuts talent and takes several steps backward.</p>
        <p>''The system has caught up with those three teams,'' said Ernie Accorsi, the Giants' general manager. ''They worked it to perfection. Now they're paying the price.''</p>
        <p>Some team executives talk of the cap as if it is a living thing, a beast than can wreck teams like a giant sea squid in a Jules Verne novel, or an angel that can deliver them from last place and empty stadiums. Older players, usually salary-cap victims because of their age, curse it worse than a steaming training camp day. The N.F.L. office loves the cap, because it levels the playing field, allowing practically any team, in any year, to win a Super Bowl, something that cannot be said about Major League Baseball or the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>If the Giants and Jets win this week, it will be the first time both teams begin the same season at 3-0. The Giants are a playoff team, and maybe with a lucky bounce or two in the postseason -- like the kind the Tennessee Titans got last year -- they could get to the Super Bowl. Same with the Jets. The salary cap can grind great teams into dust and turn better-than-average ones into champions.</p>
        <p>And if the Giants and Jets do somehow get to the Super Bowl, they would face their own cap nightmares in the years to come.</p>
        <p>''The trick is to do everything you can in as short a period of time to win a championship,'' said Accorsi, ''but if you do, the slip will come. You can't avoid it.''</p>
        <p>San Francisco, Dallas and Green Bay -- the three salary-cap amigos -- won three consecutive Super Bowls, from 1995 to 1997, using the salary-cap system to their advantage. Yet only a short time later, they're in salary-cap jail.</p>
        <p>And there is no presidential pardon for this offense.</p>
