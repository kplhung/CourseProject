        <p>Microsoft said yesterday that it had acquired MongoMusic, a Redwood City, Calif., producer of Web-based digital music technology. The MongoMusic.com Web site allows consumers to sample music and create their own ''stations'' of favorite tunes. Founded in June 1999, the company was originally financed by Nokia and Sony. Microsoft officials said they found MongoMusic attractive because of its history of strong relationships with the recording industry. With the acquisition of MongoMusic, Microsoft is expanding its MSN network of Web sites, which already includes the WindowsMedia.com music site. The value of the acquisition was not disclosed, but industry sources estimated it at $65 million.</p>
