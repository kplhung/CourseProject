        <p>Jack Collins, the president of the State Assembly, said today that he would seek an amendment to the State Constitution to require parental notification for minors seeking abortions. The amendment would undo a recent State Supreme Court ruling that overturned a parental notification law.</p>
        <p>The speaker's proposal would also try to put the new amendment beyond the reach of the state courts by declaring it immune to judicial review. However, a prominent constitutional scholar said today that any attempt by the Legislature to put its laws beyond the review of the court would violate the State Constitution's provisions for the separation of powers. ''Somebody has to interpret the laws, and that's what the court does,'' said Frank Askin, a professor of constitutional law at Rutgers Law School. ''The state court also interprets laws under the Federal Constitution, so I would say that provision is a nullity.''</p>
        <p>The state's courts have consistently proven to be protective of abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins's proposal was warmly endorsed by anti-abortion groups,  whose support the Republican speaker will presumably be seeking in his expected run for governor next year. Others, opposed to state intervention  in the abortion issue, said the speaker was grandstanding with a fruitless quest that had little or no chance of becoming law.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Collins was far from conceding any ground today. If parental permission is necessary before a child is allowed to go on a school outing, he said, it should be a prerequisite for a minor getting an abortion. ''Eliminating parental involvement in a decision that will have a profound impact on a minor's life defies logic and common sense,'' the speaker said at a news conference.  In June of last year, New Jersey became the 43rd state to enact a law requiring parental notification, and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, normally a strong defender of abortion rights, signed it. But in August, the State Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional by a 4-to-2 vote. The majority said that the Legislature could not infringe on even a minor's right to abortion ''absent compelling reasons to do so.''</p>
        <p>The United State Supreme Court has upheld the power of states to restrict abortions for minors, but it has held that such laws must allow minors to be able to bypass the law in certain cases by obtaining permission from a state court. Mr. Collins's proposed amendment contains no such judicial bypass provision.</p>
        <p>The Legislature's original parental notification measure was passed by well more than the three-fifths majority required to put a proposed amendment before the voters. But New Jersey voters have shown themselves to be generally in favor of abortion rights in elections in which the topic is a major issue.</p>
        <p>Knowing this, many Republicans will probably resist putting a divisive abortion question on the ballot in the same year as a gubernatorial election, since it could hurt their party more than it would help it, especially if Democrats directed their anti-amendment appeal to the suburban women who represent such a crucial vote in the state.</p>
