        <p>Calling themselves ''the pastor'' and ''the apostle,'' two Brooklyn men stole at least $500,000 from immigrants by promising them permanent visas if they trained to be church workers, prosecutors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>From 1995 to 1999, Stephen Andrews, 50, and Andre Mason, 28, ran the Faith Dynamics Center at 753 Flatbush Avenue, holding services, awards ceremonies and fake ordinations for hundreds of people who were told that for $1,000 to $2,000 they could get permanent resident status as religious workers.</p>

        <p>Calling themselves ''the pastor'' and ''the apostle,'' two Brooklyn men stole at least $500,000 from immigrants by promising them permanent visas if they trained to be church workers, prosecutors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>From 1995 to 1999, Stephen Andrews, 50, and Andre Mason, 28, ran the Faith Dynamics Center at 753 Flatbush Avenue, holding services, awards ceremonies and fake ordinations for hundreds of people who were told that for $1,000 to $2,000 they could get permanent resident status as religious workers.</p>
        <p>The two men were indicted yesterday in New York State Supreme Court on 17 counts, including grand larceny and criminal possession of forged alien registration cards.</p>
        <p>''These men heartlessly preyed on the hopes and desires of immigrants who sought status here in America,'' said Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, Faith Dynamics, claiming to be a Christian ministry, filed at least 473 applications with the Immigration and Naturalization Service for ''religious worker'' status, but never followed up on them. The indictment covers 12 of these cases, and may include more as investigators find more victims. Most were from the West Indies and lived in Brooklyn or Queens.</p>
        <p>''I felt very betrayed,'' said Jennifer, a native of Trinidad and Tobago, who spoke on the condition that her full name not be used. She said that for two years, she and her husband paid $50 per service as a tithe to the center, as well as $2,500 for immigration services.</p>
        <p>''We were going more than once a week,'' to church services, she said, adding that as months passed with no reply from the I.N.S., Mr. Andrews repeatedly told her, ''It takes time.'' Finally, after hearing about a similar swindle in Nassau County, she consulted an immigration counselor at another church who helped begin the investigation.</p>
        <p>That counselor, the Rev. Brian J. Jordan, a Franciscan friar of the St. Francis of Assisi Church in Manhattan, said the victims were reluctant to give their names because they fear reprisals from accomplices of the two men, who were arrested last week and face up to seven years in prison. Their center had been closed since December.</p>
        <p>According to immigration rules, an applicant for religious worker status must have worked full time in a religious vocation for two years before making the application.</p>
        <p>Gavin Miles, a prosecutor in the case, said that the immigration service had asked Faith Dynamics to document the workers' employment. ''They didn't respond,'' he said, and the service eventually abandoned the applications.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Andrews and Mr. Mason held fake ordination and awards ceremonies for which participants were required to purchase tickets and special clothing.</p>
        <p>While the victims held legitimate visitor visas at the time of their applications, some may have returned to their home countries since then, said Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for Mr. Hynes. As for the 12 who have been located, Mr. Hynes said their status was under review, but they would stay in the country during the trial. Father Jordan said he would help them reapply for permanent status.</p>
        <p>Jennifer said that Mr. Andrews was also an immigrant from her country added an extra sting to her disappointment.</p>
        <p>''He of all people should understand that we need that visa,'' she said.</p>
