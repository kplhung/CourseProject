        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report that modern-day slavery, though found in every corner of the world, is not widely known (editorial, Sept. 9). How have our super-advanced information industries simply not noticed 27 million slaves?</p>
        <p>I believe that modern-day slavery is ignored because it's not ''our'' story: the middle-class public finds in neither its victims nor its oppressors people like themselves. Slaves are prisoners of commerce, people from the lowest rungs of their often pre-modern societies, hard for first-world activists to bond with.</p>

        <p>I believe that modern-day slavery is ignored because it's not ''our'' story: the middle-class public finds in neither its victims nor its oppressors people like themselves. Slaves are prisoners of commerce, people from the lowest rungs of their often pre-modern societies, hard for first-world activists to bond with.</p>
        <p>The fight for a single standard of human conduct will be the fight for humanity's future. If ''universal human rights'' means anything, it will mean that Americans, who nearly tore our nation apart over the issue of slavery, will not rest until this ancient scourge is no longer practiced anywhere by anyone.</p>
