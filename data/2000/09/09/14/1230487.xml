        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article about young people who are forgoing college to start technology jobs properly puts kids with programming talent in the same category with baskeball players and musicians. Although programming is as easy as playing basketball and perhaps easier than playing the piano, doing it well is much harder. If someone has a natural talent, going to college is indeed a waste of time.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article about young people who are forgoing college to start technology jobs properly puts kids with programming talent in the same category with baskeball players and musicians. Although programming is as easy as playing basketball and perhaps easier than playing the piano, doing it well is much harder. If someone has a natural talent, going to college is indeed a waste of time.</p>
        <p>Beethoven didn't get a Ph.D. in music at Vienna State before he started composing, and talented basketball players go to college only to give their bodies time to mature before turning pro. Why should a talented programmer wait?</p>
        <p>The one question that comes up is what happens 10 or 15 years from now. In the computer field, anybody over 30 is over the the hill. Maybe that is the time for the programming whizzes to go back to school to study business administration so they can manage their accumulated fortunes or run their own companies, which will then be hiring only 18-year-olds.</p>
