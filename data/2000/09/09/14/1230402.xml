        <p>House Republicans fell short today in their attempt to override President Clinton's veto of the marriage-penalty bill. But while the bill is dead, the issue it addresses is very much alive politically.</p>
        <p>The vote was 270 to 158 in favor of overriding Mr. Clinton's veto, short of the two-thirds needed. Even if the bill had garnered enough votes in the House, it was given virtually no chance of getting two-thirds in the Senate.</p>
        <p>''Now is our chance to right this wrong and finally put an end to the marriage tax penalty for 25 million married couples,'' Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican leader, said before the vote.</p>
        <p>Democrats accused the Republicans of being more interested in nurturing a political issue than in passing fair tax relief. ''It's the show that counts,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland.</p>
        <p>Republicans have made relief from the marriage penalty a focal point for the fall campaign. ''Americans understand it is wrong to tax marriage,'' Mr. Armey said. ''We will have to put it up on the floor next year and have a president who will sign it.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton said today's vote showed that the Republican majority in Congress wanted to steer the country off the ''path of fiscal discipline'' that he said his administration had followed, and he appealed to lawmakers to work with him on fair tax relief for the middle class.</p>
        <p>The bill would have cut taxes for married couples by $292 billion over the next decade. Forty-nine Democrats joined 220 Republicans in trying to override the president's veto. Voting to sustain the veto were 157 Democrats and no Republicans. (The two independents in the House were divided.)</p>
        <p>The vote today was similar to the 271-to-156 tally by which the House voted for a somewhat smaller marriage-penalty-relief bill in February. The Senate passed its version on July 18, by 61 to 38.</p>
        <p>The marriage penalty is more complicated than it is sometimes made out to be. It affects many two-income couples in the middle- and upper-income brackets, typically those in which husband and wife earn roughly the same amount, by pushing them into a higher tax bracket than they would be in if they could file as single people.</p>
        <p>A Treasury Department study found that about 25 million couples paid an average marriage penalty of $1,141 on their 1999 returns.</p>
        <p>But the study found that 21 million couples received a ''bonus'' averaging $1,274 because they were married. These were couples in which only one spouse worked, or in which one partner earned much more than the other.</p>
        <p>When he vetoed the Republican-backed bill last month, Mr. Clinton said it would have benefited the wealthy while providing little relief to middle-income people.</p>
        <p>Early in the year, Mr. Clinton proposed his own idea for alleviating the marriage penalty. His plan would not have helped couples who itemize their deductions, as most people with higher incomes do. The White House estimated the cost of his proposal at $45 billion over 10 years.</p>
        <p>The bill that fell short in the House today would have cut taxes for almost all married couples, regardless of whether they now pay a penalty. It would have raised the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly but not itemizing, so that their deduction would be equal to that of two single people.</p>
        <p>The bill would have also gradually expanded the bottom 15 percent tax bracket for married couples to twice the corresponding bracket for single taxpayers. And it would have increased the earned-income tax credit limit for low-income families by $2,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The marriage-penalty quirk arose from an effort to correct an inequity that went the other way. Until about 50 years ago, households with one wage earner were taxed more heavily than those with a similar total income in which there were two wage earners.</p>
