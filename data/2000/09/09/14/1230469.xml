        <p>A close adviser to Vice President Al Gore said he had received an anonymously mailed package today that involved material designed to prepare Gov. George W. Bush for his debates with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>The adviser, former Representative Tom Downey of Long Island, N.Y., said he examined the materials briefly before giving them to his lawyer, who turned them over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation this afternoon. Mr. Downey, who has been helping Mr. Gore prepare for the Bush debates and was standing in for Mr. Bush in mock debates, also said he would recuse himself from any further debate preparation.</p>
        <p>The Bush and Gore campaigns are to meet on Thursday to negotiate the debate schedule. If the candidates adhere to a plan set up by a bipartisan commission, the first debate will be on Oct. 3 in Boston.</p>
        <p>Campaign officials said they did not know if the materials sent to Mr. Downey had been stolen from the Bush campaign or were meant to trap the Gore adviser in some sort of dirty trick. Mr. Downey's lawyer, Marc Miller, said the material -- a videotape and a sheaf of papers -- arrived in an envelope postmarked Austin, Tex., where the Bush campaign has its headquarters.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign was eager to dissociate itself quickly from the incident. After Mr. Miller called the F.B.I., campaign officials alerted The Associated Press that the packet had arrived and provided a detailed time line of Mr. Downey's actions.</p>
        <p>Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, said of Mr. Downey: ''He's being very careful and very prudent. He's handled this exactly right. No one can raise any questions about how it's being handled. What to make of it, I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said: ''We don't know what the Gore campaign claims to have in their possession, but we take it very seriously. We have asked our attorneys to review it to try to determine what they have.''</p>
        <p>At an impromptu news conference today in Westminster, Calif., the chief spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, Karen P. Hughes, said that his campaign had not yet determined whether the materials Mr. Downey received were legitimate, but that she was not aware of any missing materials like the videotape or briefing papers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes said that the campaign had asked the F.B.I. for permission to review the materials.</p>
        <p>''We're taking this seriously,'' Ms. Hughes said. ''We think the first step is to find out what the materials are, and if in fact they are legitimate.''</p>
        <p>She said that Mr. Bush and a small group senior advisers had begun debate preparations last May. She said that while the earliest sessions were not videotaped, some later ones were. She said that only Mr. Bush and a few senior advisers had legitimate access to the video tapes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes said that William M. Daley of the Gore campaign had called Mr. Evans today to tell him that they had received the materials. Asked whether the Gore campaign had handled the situation well, she said she had so few details that it was impossible to say.</p>
        <p>''I think it was right for them to send them over to authorities,'' she said of the videotapes.</p>
        <p>Of the materials, she emphasized: ''We have not seen it and we really have not had a very detailed description at all given to us.''</p>
        <p>One reason the Gore campaign was eager to get the story out in a hurry was a fear that Mr. Gore's current political momentum might suffer from a perception of any improperly gained advantage. Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign was criticized in 1980 after it obtained secret briefing papers on the debate strategy of President Jimmy Carter.</p>
        <p>Those papers, made public in 1983, revealed that Mr. Carter planned to expose Mr. Reagan's ''flip-flops'' on various issues when the two debated on Oct. 28, 1980. Reagan aides said that the information was mostly conventional wisdom, and Mr. Reagan himself said that the material had simply saved his team the trouble of ''having to go out and dig up'' widely known information. But Carter aides said that it had given Mr. Reagan a significant advantage.</p>
        <p>Today, when the package arrived at Mr. Downey's office, he happened to be preparing debate materials for Mr. Gore. ''It looked like our debate material,'' Mr. Downey said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Downey said he watched 60 to 90 seconds of the video, and saw Mr. Bush and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, who is playing Mr. Gore in the mock debates, and another person he did not know.</p>
        <p>''I looked at it, and I said, 'I shouldn't have this and shouldn't be looking at this,' '' he said. ''I knew that it was serious stuff. I know what ours looks like.''</p>
