        <p>Garry Galley has decided to become an Islander.</p>
        <p>After a weekend of discussions with his family, the 37-year-old defenseman accepted a one-year, $850,000 contract yesterday with a $1.1 million option by the team. The deal initially was made last week as the Islanders sought to replace Zdeno Chara, who was holding out. But after Chara returned Sunday, General Manager Mike Milbury left the offer to Galley on the table.</p>
        <p>Galley, who has missed only 17 games with injuries in 16 seasons, is expected to arrive on Long Island this weekend following the team's exhibition games against the Philadelphia Flyers today and tomorrow. The Islanders' only preseason game at the Nassau Coliseum will be next Wednesday against the Stanley Cup champion Devils.</p>
        <p>Galley is a durable, versatile defenseman who prefers the left side. He spent the last three seasons with the Los Angeles Kings, with whom he began his career in 1984. He appeared in 70 games last season, totaling 9 goals and 30 points.</p>
        <p>''He brings experience, versatility and depth,'' said Milbury, as the Islanders ended a six-day minicamp in Lake Placid yesterday. ''He still has some mileage left and he's an excellent skater and competitor.''</p>
        <p>The addition of Galley, along with Roman Hamrlik and Kevin Haller, completes the retooling of an Islander defense that will be considerably older than last season's. In addition to Kenny Jonsson, Eric Cairns and Chara, the Islanders also have the youngsters Mathieu Biron, Branislav Mezei and Yevgeny Korolev along with the more experienced Aris Birmanis and Anders Myrvold.</p>
