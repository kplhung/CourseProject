        <p>The Better Business Bureau says there were 9,123 complaints against furniture retailers across the country in 1999, ranking them third, close behind computer dealers (9,538), but far behind auto dealerships (17,686). Ronna D. Brown, president of the Better Business Bureau serving the New York City region (which itself had 1,209 complaints about furniture retailers), said most involved late delivery or customers' receiving the wrong goods, or goods they thought were of unacceptable quality. Ms. Brown sees reason to be hopeful, however: ''Two out of every three complaints we receive are resolved to the customer's satisfaction,'' she said, ''so things could be a lot bleaker.''</p>
