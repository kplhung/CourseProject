        <p>As the fall TV season gets under way, network honchos find themselves trapped in their own version of ''Survivor,'' with a nemesis more treacherous than a rat, a snake or a fat naked guy: a new electronic device called TiVo, which eliminates TV commercials. But TiVo may just be the beginning. If it proves successful, it is only a matter of time before manufacturers produce other TV-altering devices to complicate network executives' lives even further:</p>

        <p>As the fall TV season gets under way, network honchos find themselves trapped in their own version of ''Survivor,'' with a nemesis more treacherous than a rat, a snake or a fat naked guy: a new electronic device called TiVo, which eliminates TV commercials. But TiVo may just be the beginning. If it proves successful, it is only a matter of time before manufacturers produce other TV-altering devices to complicate network executives' lives even further:</p>
        <p>TeenGo: Filters out vapid dialogue from teenage drama shows; voice-recognition feature activated by the words ''popular,'' ''unfair'' and ''duh.''</p>
        <p>VeTo: Instantly zaps a program that is regrettably the favorite of one's spouse; popular settings include ''WWF Smackdown'' and ''Antiques Roadshow.''</p>
        <p>SleaZo: Eliminates blatant network rip-offs of HBO's ''Sex and the City.''</p>
        <p>KathieLeeVo: In a nod to the ratings surge enjoyed by ''Live with Regis'' since the departure of Regis Philbin's co-host, removes Kathie Lee Gifford from all other shows in which she might appear.</p>
        <p>SqueaKo: Excises all subliminal references to rodents from negative campaign ads.</p>
        <p>GeeZo: Prevents the broadcast of heavyweight boxing matches between former champions over the age of 60.</p>
        <p>DeleTo: Instantly edits out all F.T.C. officials' Hollywood-blaming speeches that feature the phrase, ''This isn't about censorship.''</p>
        <p>HeaveHo: Seeks out and eliminates all programs destined for an early cancellation; device is set to be especially sensitive to programs featuring single dads coping with unruly broods of smart-mouthed children, and any talk shows involving Roseanne.</p>
