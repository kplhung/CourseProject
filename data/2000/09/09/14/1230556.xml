        <p>MANDABLE-John E. (Jack) 1922-2000. On Wednesday, September 6, 2000, at Hospice of Northern Virginia, Arlington, VA. Jack Mandable, dearly beloved husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He is survived by his wife, Dorothy Rodriguez Mandable; a son, J. Burk Mandable, and a daughter, Barbara J. Livingston, from an earlier marriage; also five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Born in Chicago, Ill, Mr. Mandable lived in Westport, Ct. for almost 40 years prior to moving to Arlington, Va in 1991. He spent most of his professional life in publishing, most recently with Newsweek as Advertising Director, until retiring from that magazine in 1985. He possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of jazz, a lifelong, abiding passion for that music and the utmost respect and appreciation for its musicians. His family requests that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made payable to: Center for Jazz Studies, referenced ''The Jack Mandable Jazz Collection'' and mailed to Columbia University, 602 Philosophy Hall, 1150 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10027</p>
