        <p>Pedro Espada Jr., State Senate candidate, spent the weekend making a last campaign swing through the 32nd District in the Bronx. Lawyers for Pedro Espada Jr., defendant in a criminal case, spent the weekend preparing for his trial in State Supreme Court in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The Senate campaign was successful. Mr. Espada defeated the incumbent, David Rosado, in the Democratic primary on Tuesday and earned the chance to regain the legislative seat he lost in 1996, when he and his son, Pedro Gautier Espada, who was running for an Assembly seat, were thrown off the ballot for irregularities in their petition signatures.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada must now turn his attention to the courtroom and his 1998 indictment on charges that he and two co-defendants improperly used funds from a health maintenance organization to pay off expenses from his and his son's political campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada has long maintained that his indictment was politically motivated, because he ran afoul of the Bronx Democratic Party, which supported Mr. Rosado in the primary. His trial on charges of second-degree grand larceny promises to put under scrutiny at least a small part of the empire he has built in the Bronx over the last two decades, using a health clinic as a base. He parlayed that base into the political power that culminated in his election to the State Senate in 1992.</p>
        <p>At issue in the trial, which is expected to begin tomorrow with jury selection, is whether the relationships between Mr. Espada's political and health care activities crossed a legal line. Prosecutors say that Mr. Espada used $221,000 from the Universal Health Plan, a health maintenance organization for Medicaid-eligible patients that he established in 1994, to pay campaign expenses like those for advertisements, posters, petition forms and photographers. The health plan was financed with city and state money. Mr. Espada is also facing lesser charges related to accusations that false reports were filed with the state.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Espada's co-defendants is Sandra Love, who was on the board of Universal Health Plan and was a senior vice president at Soundview Health Center, which Mr. Espada founded. Long one of Mr. Espada's closest associates, she has also been indicted on charges that she improperly diverted state funds that were supposed to revive the Teatro de Puerto Rico, a defunct community theater in the Bronx, to the Soundview Health Center and to the Committee to Re-Elect Pedro Espada Jr.; she faces a separate trial in that case. According to the indictment, the funds were specifically earmarked for the theater project through legislation sponsored by Mr. Espada.</p>
        <p>The other defendant, John P. Connors, was the executive director of the Universal Health Plan, which is no longer functioning.</p>
        <p>If convicted of second-degree grand larceny, each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.</p>
        <p>Mr. Connors's lawyer, Murray Richman, said the defense would not dispute what the money was used for, but he said there was nothing illegal about using it for those purposes.</p>
        <p>In part, the defense may rest on the fine points of corporate law, specifically whether as a not-for-profit corporation, the Universal Health Plan was barred from using its funds for political purposes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada's defense may also rest on the interconnection between his interests. According to this argument, as a state senator, Mr. Espada would be helpful to the Universal Health Plan, justifying the use of its funds for campaign purposes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada founded the not-for-profit Comprehensive Community Development Corporation in 1978, saying he wanted to provide better health care to the people of the Bronx. Three years later he founded the Soundview Health Center, and over the years he has added other clinics, day care centers, programs for the elderly and the like.</p>
        <p>The programs were widely advertised, featuring Mr. Espada's name and picture. As part of his campaigning last weekend, he attended a ''Bronx Family Unity Day,'' featuring refreshments, entertainment and health information, sponsored by his Soundview HealthCare Network Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Espada's supporters have waged a political campaign of sorts against the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, saying he kowtows to the political agenda of the Bronx Democratic Party. Mr. Johnson has said that his actions were not politically motivated.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Pedro Gautier Espada, who is now a city councilman, videotaped a conversation with Mr. Rosado in which he insinuated that prosecution could be deterred if the senior Mr. Espada did not run against Mr. Rosado. Mr. Rosado later said he was lying in the hopes of gaining a political advantage.</p>
