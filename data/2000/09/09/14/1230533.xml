        <p>Coach Ron Low of the Rangers said that last night would provide another chance for prospects to impress the front office and the coaching staff. Manny Malhotra and Filip Novak made the most of it, as did, to a lesser extent, Francois Fortier, Jeff Ulmer, Jason Doig and Pavel Brendl.</p>
        <p>Jamie Lundmark did not.</p>
        <p>Malhotra and Novak each had an assist, as their blue squad defeated the white squad, 5-2, in a full scrimmage that officially marked the end of the Rangers' sixth training camp at the University of Vermont in Burlington.</p>
        <p>Malhotra's performance was another sign that the 20-year-old center is regaining the confidence he lost last season when he was caught in a power struggle within the team's previous regime.</p>
        <p>Novak, an 18-year-old defenseman from the Czech Republic who has been the surprise of camp, has opened enough eyes for one high-ranking member of the organization to say that he will be given a long look during the preseason.</p>
        <p>Fortier (2 assists), Ulmer (goal, assist) and Doig (goal) are still long shots to make the team. Brendl had an assist and drew praise from Low.</p>
        <p>When the coach was asked about Lundmark, though, he said: ''Jamie was on the other end of the scale.'' Lundmark finished with a plus-minus rating of minus-5 after being on the ice for each of the blue squad's goals.</p>
