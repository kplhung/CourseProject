        <p>The money keeps coming, but the number of Janus funds keeps shrinking. Yesterday, Janus Capital closed its flagship Janus Fund to new investors, its fifth fund closing this year.</p>
        <p>The assets of Janus have nearly tripled since the beginning of last year, and to effectively manage its rapidly expanding assets, the company has now closed half of its 16 equity funds.</p>
        <p>''As we topped the $50 billion level, I started worrying we'd have a flood of new investors coming in that would dilute the effect of our great ideas for current shareholders,'' said Blaine Rollins, who took over management of the $48.6 billion Janus Fund in January. Since the beginning of last year, the fund has nearly doubled in size and has become the nation's fourth-largest mutual fund.</p>
        <p>Such girth is generally thought to make the task of running a fund more difficult. Investments in small and midsize companies have less impact on the fund's performance, a manager's moves are closely scrutinized and investments in each stock grow so large they can be difficult to shift quietly without moving the market price.</p>
        <p>As a result, several of the nation's biggest mutual funds, including the $109.8 billion Fidelity Magellan, are closed, except to existing investors and regular retirement plan contributions. But Janus, the fifth-largest fund company, has growing pains firmwide.</p>
        <p>''Managing their growth is a huge issue,'' said Russ Kinnel, an analyst at the fund-tracking firm, Morningstar. ''They've grown so fast that it's starting to strain their resources. One of the issues is that because they have so many funds closed, it channels the new money into the remaining funds.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, the last year has been a tumultuous one for Janus. First, there was the long-running feud between executives of Janus and executives of its parent, Kansas City Southern Industries. Earlier this year, Janus was packaged in a spinoff, called Stilwell Financial, with several of Kansas City Southern's financial holdings. Janus officials, including Thomas Bailey, the company's founder, had publicly objected to the deal, preferring to be spun off on their own.</p>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, James Craig, Janus's highly regarded chief investment officer and the longtime manager of the Janus Fund, retired to manage a charitable foundation.</p>
        <p>And then there was the market. Most of the Janus equity funds have similar investing styles and make aggressive bets on technology stocks. Last year, those bets led Janus to chart-topping returns, and the Janus Fund gained 47 percent.</p>
        <p>This year, however, has not been nearly as kind to technology investors. The Janus Fund has held up well, gaining 5.8 percent, better than the 1 percent return of the S.&amp; P. 500. But the firm's popular Janus Twenty fund has struggled. It has lost 5.9 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Janus continues to be the best-selling mutual fund firm in the industry. The $38.8 billion in new money that came into the entire firm during the first eight months of this year is already $2 billion more than flowed in during all of last year.</p>
        <p>''I became concerned what the tidal wave of inflows would be next year,'' Mr. Rollins said. ''If the fund is going to $100 billion, I want to do that on the performance side.''</p>
        <p>To help absorb some of the company's new assets, Janus said it would introduce Janus Fund 2, which will be managed by one of Mr. Rollins' assistants.</p>
