        <p>Finally in this election year, the politicians found something they could agree on: the entertainment industry should be taken to task for marketing violent movies, music and video games to children.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, told the Senate Commerce Committee today, ''This practice is outrageous, it is deceptive and it has to stop.''</p>
        <p>An hour or so later, Lynne V. Cheney, whose husband, Dick, is the Republican vice-presidential candidate, said the problem goes beyond the marketing practices. ''There is a problem with the product they market,'' she said, ''no matter how they market it.''</p>
        <p>The committee chairman, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, weighed in, ''While I do not begrudge anyone's honest profits, I do not think they need to come at the expense of our children's well-being.''</p>
        <p>Despite all the talk about the well-being of children, the well-being of the parties' presidential races was never far in the background. Mr. Lieberman, for example, mentioned Vice President Al Gore several times. If he and Mr. Gore are elected, he said, they intend to take action against the entertainment companies if they persist in their marketing practices with children.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cheney, the former chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, noted pointedly that Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman  planned to attend a fund-raiser this week thrown by Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of Miramax, the movie studio that is a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company.</p>
        <p>That led Senator McCain to remark that the film industry had made $18 million in campaign contributions this year.</p>
        <p>The hearing today was called to examine the report released Monday by the Federal Trade Commission, which found that the vast majority of adult-rated movies, recordings and electronic games were marketed to underage customers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weinstein and a dozen other movie executives refused to appear, outraging Senator McCain. ''Their hubris is stunning and serves to underscore the lack of corporate responsibility so striking in this report,'' the senator said.</p>
        <p>The chief lobbyist for the movie studios, Jack Valenti, did testify. He said the movie executives had declined to come to Washington ''not because they were ducking and running but because they have other things on their schedules they could not erase.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain demanded that they come to a second hearing two weeks from today, and without making a specific commitment, Mr. Valenti suggested they would comply.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti, who has been a prominent lobbyist for more than 30 years and who was a special assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson earlier, is so comfortable at the witness table and so familiar to the senators on the panel that their exchanges seemed perfunctory, as if each side was making moves in a board game.</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti conceded that ''some marketing people'' seemed to have ''stepped over the line.'' He said there was no excuse, for instance, in testing violent movies on focus groups of 10- and 12-year-olds, a practice the F.T.C. cited, and added, ''I can guarantee you that's not going to happen again.''</p>
        <p>On balance, Mr. Valenti said, the Congress ''should feel an immense pride in this unique American creative asset and the daily contributions of the movie and television industry to this nation's art and commerce and the endurance of its responsibility to American parents.''</p>
        <p>He cited the falling crime rate in recent years as proof violent films did not cause crime.</p>
        <p>That was too much for Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, who has been in Washington since 1967, almost as long as Mr. Valenti.</p>
        <p>Rolling his eyes, Mr. Hollings declared, ''To come here and have the unmitigated gall to take credit for lowering the crime rate -- whoo-hee!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Valenti just smiled.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cheney said the problem was not merely one of marketing to children but the actual content of the movies and music. The solution, she said, was not government regulation, which would breach the First Amendment, but community pressure on entertainment companies.</p>
        <p>To make her case, she handed out to the committee members the lyrics to ''Kill You,'' a song by Eminem, the rap and hip-hop artist, filled with vulgarities, blood and rape. One line goes: ''Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cheney said: ''It is despicable. It is horrible. This is dreadful. This is shameful. This is awful.''</p>
        <p>She said she had written to women on the board of Seagram Company, the parent company of Universal Music Group, which made the compact disc of the song, and urged them to stop the distribution of such songs.</p>
        <p>Long after Mrs. Cheney had left the hearing, Danny Goldberg, president of Artemis Records, became the first person of the day to defend popular culture. ''Millions of people like it,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''In a free society, what do you do about it?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldberg suggested that one of the reasons young people were disaffected with politics was that ''politicians and academics who obviously have no real understanding of their culture make sweeping generalizations about their entertainment.''</p>
        <p>''They are not represented here today,'' he said. ''There are no music fans.''</p>
