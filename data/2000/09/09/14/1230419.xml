        <p>Watch out, here comes Fern J. Mallis, first lady of American clothiers, deeply tanned (Southampton and Cyprus) and deep into her fashion-as-armor mode (she wears Calvin like a second skin), barging into her cannily cluttered office at the Council of Fashion Designers of America on Broadway at 40th Street. And there's more Fern in photo-op heaven over on the credenza: basking in Liz Taylor's orbit; projecting gal power with Hillary Rodham Clinton; beaming beside President Bill; gazing up at a snazzily suited basketball icon she distractedly refers to as Magic Irving.</p>
        <p>The plastic grenade on her desk has an accompanying sign: Complaint Department. The red boxing gloves are a glib gift from the men's wear designer Jeffrey Banks. Don't miss the message: Fern is a fighter who will punch your lights out to get her point across.</p>

        <p>Watch out, here comes Fern J. Mallis, first lady of American clothiers, deeply tanned (Southampton and Cyprus) and deep into her fashion-as-armor mode (she wears Calvin like a second skin), barging into her cannily cluttered office at the Council of Fashion Designers of America on Broadway at 40th Street. And there's more Fern in photo-op heaven over on the credenza: basking in Liz Taylor's orbit; projecting gal power with Hillary Rodham Clinton; beaming beside President Bill; gazing up at a snazzily suited basketball icon she distractedly refers to as Magic Irving.</p>
        <p>The plastic grenade on her desk has an accompanying sign: Complaint Department. The red boxing gloves are a glib gift from the men's wear designer Jeffrey Banks. Don't miss the message: Fern is a fighter who will punch your lights out to get her point across.</p>
        <p>What's her point? American fashion designers are the best. (But don't think it didn't pain her to purge her closet of Armanis, Missonis, Chanels and Diors when, hellbent on ensuring American labels global respect, she joined the council in 1991.)</p>
        <p>''It kind of broke my heart,'' she says, about doing the politically -- sartorially speaking -- correct thing.</p>
        <p>Now Ms. Mallis, 51 and aggrieved to publicize it, is an executive director three times over: of the council; of the CFDA Foundation, which has raised $30 million to date for its pet causes, AIDS and breast cancer; and of 7th on Sixth Inc., the company that credits itself with turning New York City into an epicenter of haute style with its tented fashion shows in Bryant Park. (The latest round starts today, runs through Sept. 22, and promises to ease the worry of anyone prematurely panicked about what to wear for next spring.)</p>
        <p>A hint from Ms. Mallis to the uninvited: gold is the message  (check out her Calvin sandals, Donna Karan cardigan and toenails). And never, ever throw out metallics and animal prints, fashion's recyclables. As proof, she hoists a vintage Carlos Falchi satchel made of deceased python above her head like a big game hunter who's ventured deep into her closet's discard heap and hit the bull's-eye.</p>
        <p>''Carlos Falchi,'' she gloats. (Nothing like re-experiencing a shopper's high and bagging a status item without having to expend any cash. Ms. Mallis loves fashion so much that she is no stranger to paying retail if the impulse strikes. Though she can buy her finery wholesale, she surfs the Saks catalogs just like everyone else.)</p>
        <p>Not that Ms. Mallis is a slave to trends. When the rest of the fashion firmament goes barelegged in winter, she sticks to her stockings. She's not that thick-skinned. But a trend that stimulates sales for New York's $20 billion fashion industry? She's all adrenaline.</p>
        <p>''It's very easy to take the fashion industry seriously,'' Ms. Mallis says. ''I grew up caring about this stuff.'' Her father (scarves) and uncles (textiles) worked in the garment district and welcomed her to their factories ''before Gloria Steinem ever thought of creating Take Your Daughter to Work Day. I was the accessory teen queen.''</p>
        <p>SHE is still serious enough on the subject to recall her 1969 guest editorship at Mademoiselle magazine with reverence, to boast, not blush, about winning the best-dressed award  at James Madison High School in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The pragmatist in Ms. Mallis, a fine arts major at the University of Buffalo, long ago abandoned any cover girl aspirations. ''I wish that were an option, but I've never been quite thin enough,'' she says, adding, ''or quite narcissistic enough.''</p>
        <p>But what she lacks in model appreciation she makes up in veneration of America's designers, Vienna's ornery Helmut Lang included. So what if he snubbed the council's June awards gala despite an unprecedented nomination in three categories. He's big business. Not to mention that she takes his relocation to New York personally, an endorsement of her mission to legitimize Manhattan as a fashion destination on a par with Milan and Paris. Pressed to define what qualifies Mr. Lang for membership in her United States stable, she snaps, ''He's here!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mallis, single but available if the right guy happens along -- ''In this business, I don't meet a ton of straight men'' -- might not be a narcissist, but there's no stifling her promotional skills. ''It's not self-promotion, I promote this,'' she counters, brandishing a 7th on Sixth brochure.</p>
        <p>Stan Herman, the council president, hired her after the 34 applicants preceding her struck him as insufficiently bombastic to mobilize United States designers under a single umbrella (or tent). Designers may be her darlings, but woe to those who bully her for better time slots or whine about a tent's lack of personality. Ms. Mallis's motto is, ''Hey stupid, it's all about the clothes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Herman says Ms. Mallis ''lives, breathes and proselytizes'' for the council and ''has gotten a lot of scars'' while transforming it from an insular server of the Nancy Reagan clique to a mainstream force.</p>
        <p>He intimates that she has pushed her product so well that 7th on Sixth is being shopped, something she doesn't deny. Has Ms. Mallis promoted herself out of a job? She smiles primly, then says something equally out of character. ''I really am not at liberty to discuss that.''</p>
