        <p>A new public-private venture to help speed the growth of starting high technology companies opened yesterday on the campus of the Borough of Manhattan Community College, on Chambers Street near the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>Unlike most such incubators, the new center, called the TeleMedia Accelerator, will serve companies that are already a little further along, said Shari Ford, the president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>She said the first companies at the 22,000-square-foot center included  Broadway Digital Entertainment, a company that has bought the rights to digitize Broadway productions dating to the 1960's; Tidex System, an Israeli company that has developed technology for digital video; DuoCash, which has created new technology for paying bills incurred from electronic commerce; and Production Designer, whose software makes it easier to translate live performances into digital form.</p>
        <p>The companies were chosen by the investors in the new center, the New York City Investment Fund, Bear Stearns Constellation Ventures, and Psilos Group, Ms. Ford said. The companies hope that the college site will create research opportunities for faculty members and jobs for students. Four similar centers are planned for other campuses of the City University of New York.</p>
