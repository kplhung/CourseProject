        <p>New York City yesterday won another endorsement of its improved financial health when Standard &amp; Poor's raised the city's bond rating to the highest level since the fiscal crisis of the mid 70's.</p>
        <p>The new A rating, up from A-, is the second time Standard &amp; Poor's has improved its rating of the city's bonds since 1998, but New York is still 8th among the nation's top 10 cities, according to Standard &amp; Poor's. The improvement follows a similar  upgrade last month by Moody's Investors Services.</p>

        <p>New York City yesterday won another endorsement of its improved financial health when Standard &amp; Poor's raised the city's bond rating to the highest level since the fiscal crisis of the mid 70's.</p>
        <p>The new A rating, up from A-, is the second time Standard &amp; Poor's has improved its rating of the city's bonds since 1998, but New York is still 8th among the nation's top 10 cities, according to Standard &amp; Poor's. The improvement follows a similar  upgrade last month by Moody's Investors Services.</p>
        <p>''The city has made good progress in its financial management, and certainly the strength of the economy has helped,'' said Colleen Woodell, a director in public finance for Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>City officials said yesterday the upgrades should save millions of dollars a year as a result of lower interest costs on money borrowed to pay for construction projects. The city is to offer about $425 million of tax-exempt debt securities for sale next week.</p>
