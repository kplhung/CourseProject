        <p>The Mets' 4-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers yesterday was a Jay Payton production in three acts. Mixing tragicomedy with suspense, Payton presented the Brewers with a gift run in the first inning, then wrote himself award-winning parts in the ninth and 10th innings.</p>
        <p>Critics in the Mets' clubhouse applauded Payton's second- and third-act performances because they turned another potentially devastating loss attributed to the missing-offense malady into an uplifting victory that strengthened the Mets' hold on the National League wild-card spot and let the Atlanta Braves know they shouldn't celebrate the East division championship yet.</p>
        <p>''I was offering steak dinners for anybody who got a run back for us,'' Payton said of his first-inning play that allowed the certain third out to become a run-scoring error.</p>
        <p>On the 11-game road trip that begins tonight, Payton can take himself and Robin Ventura to dinner. Their doubles produced the tying run in the ninth, and Payton lined a two-out, three-run home run over the left-center-field fence in the 10th.</p>
        <p>The victory was the third in the Mets' last four games, and even though they aren't scoring tons of runs consistently, at this juncture of the season, a victory is a victory, however it is achieved.</p>
        <p>Overshadowed by the Mets' comeback were the sizzling performances of the starting pitchers -- Jeff D'Amico for the Brewers (no runs in eight innings) and Mike Hampton for the Mets (one unearned run in eight innings) -- and the dud of a batting performance by Mike Piazza, who struck out all four times he batted. The first three strikeouts ended innings, twice with runners in scoring position, and the fourth came just before Ventura lined a game-tying double to right field with two out in the ninth.</p>
        <p>Until that hit, it appeared that a missed fly ball in the first inning would decide the outcome. Angel Echevarria walked with two out, and Richie Sexson hit an eminently catchable fly to right-center. Lenny Harris, starting in right for the first time this season, called for the ball. But so did center fielder Payton.</p>
        <p>''We both could have caught it,'' Payton said. ''Lenny probably could have caught it easier than me. But when I'm in center, I'm aggressive. I go after the ball, and I'm going to call for it. I want my corner outfielders to get behind me. But Lenny was probably there before me. I'm just coming over. He heard me at the last second and bailed. I wasn't sure he was going to bail, so we both bailed. It was my fault. It's my responsibility to catch that ball.''</p>
        <p>The ball fell between the outfielders -- Harris was charged with the error -- and Echevarria raced home with the unearned run. It was a slight start for the Brewers, but D'Amico made it stand up. A surprisingly successful pitcher who has overcome an assortment of injuries, D'Amico breezed through the Mets, allowing only four hits and striking out 10 in eight innings, including five of the first seven batters.</p>
        <p>But he threw 112 pitches, and Manager Davey Lopes wasn't taking chances. He had Curtis Leskanic, the team's closer, pitch the ninth.</p>
        <p>''I saw him shaking hands after the eighth, so I knew he was coming out,'' said Payton, the Mets' first batter in the ninth. ''I had to get my mind set for Leskanic. He comes at you hard.''</p>
        <p>Payton's first-inning play was not far from his thoughts. ''I was thinking about that the whole game,'' he said. ''We haven't been scoring runs and I didn't want us to go down because of a ball that was misplayed in the first inning.''</p>
        <p>The right-handed-hitting Payton lined the fourth pitch to right field for a double. ''Leskanic made a pretty good pitch down and away,'' Payton said. ''I just stuck my bat out there. As hard as he throws, you don't really have to put a hard swing on it. The ball took off.''</p>
        <p>Payton moved to third as Edgardo Alfonzo bounced out. After Piazza swung at a high fastball well out of the strike zone and sat down with strikeout No. 4, Ventura swung at the first pitch and lined a double to left, driving in Payton with the steak-producing run.</p>
        <p>Payton's Act III came not much later. With one out in the 10th, Mike Bordick singled against Juan Acevedo. Joe McEwing then lofted a high pop-up into short center, and the Brewers proceeded to reprise the Mets' first-inning farce.</p>
        <p>As McEwing slammed his bat to the ground, shortstop Mark Loretta went back and center fielder Marquis Grissom came in. It appeared that either could catch the ball. But Grissom called for it, Loretta fell to the ground to get out of his way and Grissom, like Payton, did not make the catch. It fell for a single, giving the Mets runners at first and second.</p>
        <p>Bubba Trammell popped up for the second out, but Payton lashed a line drive to left-center that Lou Collier pursued.</p>
        <p>''Actually, I thought it probably was going to be caught,'' Payton said. ''I didn't think I hit it that good. It was a slider, and I stayed back and I put a good swing on it, but I thought I got out in front of it just a little bit. I was running hard watching the left fielder. I thought the way he was running he would go back and make a play on it.''</p>
        <p>But the ball took off and sailed over the fence. ''I got some new bats today,'' the jubilant Payton said, ''so maybe the wood's a little better.''</p>
        <p>The Mets felt much better when Payton reached his place at home plate and his play was over.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>MIKE PIAZZA struck out four times in a game for only the second time in his career;. He did it the first time was on July, 5, 1994, while playing for Los Angeles against Montreal. . . . ARMANDO BENITEZ, whose right big toe had kept him from pitching for a few days, pitched the 10th inning and gained a victory. He said the toe was a little sore but that the pain was gone. . . . JEFF D'AMICO lowered his earned run average to 2.41. RANDY JOHNSON leads the National League with that same E.R.A., but D'Amico is three innings short of qualifying for the league leaders.</p>
