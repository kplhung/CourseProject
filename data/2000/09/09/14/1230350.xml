      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The British Isles were ripe territory for Italian Romantic melodrama. Verdi made his visits to Shakespeare, but Donizetti came before him, with his fascination with dark Scottish castles (''Lucia di Lammermoor'') and lethal Tudor politics (''Anna Bolena,'' ''Maria Stuarda''). Add to the latter his opera ''Roberto Devereux,'' which opened the New York City Opera's fall season on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>As history, this retelling of the Elizabeth and Essex saga is hokum. As opera in the style of the 1830's, it constructs a simple geometry of passions: desire, jealousy, fate and revenge configured into a straight line and ending in tragedy, not to mention significant loss of blood. The Queen loves Essex. Essex loves Sarah. Sarah is married to Nottingham. Nottingham is Essex's friend. Telltale props, a ring and a scarf, make their obligatory appearances. One head rolls before the final curtain, and several more are promised. Everyone goes home unhappy.</p>

        <p>As history, this retelling of the Elizabeth and Essex saga is hokum. As opera in the style of the 1830's, it constructs a simple geometry of passions: desire, jealousy, fate and revenge configured into a straight line and ending in tragedy, not to mention significant loss of blood. The Queen loves Essex. Essex loves Sarah. Sarah is married to Nottingham. Nottingham is Essex's friend. Telltale props, a ring and a scarf, make their obligatory appearances. One head rolls before the final curtain, and several more are promised. Everyone goes home unhappy.</p>
        <p>It is easy to mock such proceedings, yet Donizetti at his most eloquent will not allow it. The sequence of trios in the final moments of Act II and Act III rise above their theatrical oversimplifications, and it is interesting that the City Opera's oddly distracted production really comes to life only at these moments.</p>
        <p>Andrew Lieberman's set sees ''Roberto Devereux'' as ''The Queen Elizabeth Show.'' Her name is up in lights that frame a stage within a stage. There is a marquee spelling out ''Elisabetta,'' and the queen's blown-up likenesses are everywhere. The stage pictures and their garish lighting are ugly, perhaps intentionally so, but this is an opera not about spectacle but movement. Tragedy is swift, cleanly engineered and ambiguity-free. Donizetti's operas are a kind of abstract art in which representations of life recede and line takes over. Form does not receive content; it creates content.</p>
        <p>It is not pleasant to report that the City Opera's version is half-cooked at best. Pervasively miscast, it features a collection of singers who largely wander around in search of their characters. Donizettian simplicity demands razor-sharp action and reaction. Mark Lamos's direction, whatever its intentions, has not had time to gel. The chorus is notably unexcited. Jane Dutton, as Sarah, has a healthy, big voice, but she has been given a white-hot role that her youth and inexperience cannot decipher. Mark Delavan's soft, veiled baritone is simply not enough for Nottingham's rage.</p>
        <p>Lauren Flanigan is the closest thing this company has to a reigning diva, and her versatility has been much admired by listeners and much exploited by her employers. A Donizetti heroine, however, is a stretch this admirable soprano makes with difficulty. Elisabetta, to say the least, is a virtuoso role: wide in range, rich with ornament and just as difficult for its flights of velocity as for its sustained languors. It requires luxury of sound, technique and a natural extroversion.</p>
        <p>Ms. Flanigan wrestles determinedly with all three, but the audience ends up noting the struggle more than the outcome. Indeed, what the listener hears is not Elisabetta's grand passions but a singer's self-absorbed pursuit of a difficult part. The role also hits Ms. Flanigan's voice in its most unattractive territories, reducing the sound to something hard and shrill. Her frequently drifting pitch may have been more mental uncertainty than a failure of the ear.</p>
        <p>In the title role Fernando De La Mora sang with an underpowered tenor, but he at least seemed convinced and concentrated. In his brief appearance as Raleigh, Kevin Burdette made a strong impression as well. The orchestra under George Manahan played reasonably.</p>
        <p>Indeed, after a summer of festivals, for which productions can be more slowly and patiently prepared, the listener comes to this ''Roberto Devereux'' with what may be unrealistic expectations. The repertory season is with us again and with it, haste and expediency. I suppose we should just lower our sights.</p>
