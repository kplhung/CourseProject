        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton won the admiration of a small group of undecided voters tonight for what they called an assured, good-natured performance in her face-off with Representative Rick A. Lazio, who struck them as too acerbic.</p>
        <p>Doug Taggart, vice president of a financial services company who lives in this northern Westchester suburb with his wife and two daughters, was typical in his assessment of the first debate in this pivotal race for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>''If one were to say who was senatorial, it is she,'' Mr. Taggart said of Mrs. Clinton. ''He came off as a much more immature person, and she came off very collected. And she was warmer than I've ever seen her.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taggart is one of a panel of undecided voters drawn from early New York Times/CBS News polls who have been discussing their thoughts, wishes, hopes and disappointments as the Senate race has unfolded. These voters, six of them still undecided from an original group of 11, did not declare the debate decisive, although they were of one mind about who had won the day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taggart snorted derisively at Mr. Lazio's repeated references to Mrs. Clinton as a carpetbagger. He questioned the wisdom of holding President Clinton's infidelity against her, and he waited, in frustration, for a clear explanation of what he called the congressman's inconsistent voting record.</p>
        <p>What most irked Mr. Taggart, and the others, was Mr. Lazio's relentless attacks on Mrs. Clinton. ''If he thinks he's being stern with her, he's out of place,'' Mr. Taggart said. ''He just sounds sassy. There's a lack of gravitas.''</p>
        <p>The same was true for Tom and Barbara Smith, a struggling working-class couple in Saugerties, N.Y., who watched the debate from their local firehouse. The Smiths, who have begged for a race free of mudslinging, said Mr. Lazio had set out to ''destroy character'' and ''put people down'' in a way that was both ''cruel'' and ''not constructive.''</p>
        <p>Karl Schwartz, a computer consultant on Staten Island whose view of the race has been driven by the fact that his wife has cancer, said he continued to lean toward Mr. Lazio because ''he scores high in his commitment to helping cancer patients.'' But Mr. Schwartz gave Mrs. Clinton high marks for her ''command of the facts'' and her ''comfortable and professional'' demeanor.</p>
        <p>''There is no doubt that she can work effectively as a senator, that she can express the issues well,'' Mr. Schwartz said, sounding agonized that his ''one dimensional'' approach to a decision might be unfair to Mrs. Clinton. ''I'll give Hillary one more chance to be specific about cancer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Broadcast from Buffalo, the debate was dense with technical questions about the flagging upstate economy. On this topic, Mrs. Clinton seemed both more specific and confident in her answers, which won the applause of Cathy and Bob Harrison from Amsterdam, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Harrison, a nurse, who was leaning toward Mr. Lazio just a few months ago, said she found him ''less committed'' on the issues of returning jobs to the northern and western reaches of the state. Her husband, a social studies teacher, agreed.</p>
        <p>There were two dramatic moments of the hourlong debate: the screening of Mrs. Clinton's firm defense of her husband on the NBC ''Today'' program in January 1998 during the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and Mr. Lazio's challenge, with document and pen in hand, that both  candidates sign a pledge not to use  soft money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taggart saw the first lady's reaction to the tape as a demonstration of grace under pressure. ''It was obviously very painful to witness and respond,'' he said. ''It made you feel for her.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Smith, in Saugerties, took great offense at the use of the tape. ''It's not fair,'' she said. ''This is about what they're going to do, not what her husband did.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Lazio's bravura move of presenting Mrs. Clinton with a pledge to eschew soft money, Mr. Taggart said it was a no-win moment for her. She could not sign a document she had not read, he said. So, instead, she held firm that she would do so only if Mr. Lazio's supporters all avoided future soft money donations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwartz, for his part, found the soft-money pledge a foolish bit of theatrics. ''It was hard to look at,'' he said, scornfully. But Mr. Harrison saw it as the congressman's best moment. ''To me that was the strongest thing he had to say,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But moments of high drama aside, Mr. Taggart and the others were impressed by Mrs. Clinton's command of the issues and her self-control when baited by Mr. Lazio, who led off almost all of his exchanges with an attack on her character. ''She didn't let it become tit-for-tat,'' Mr. Taggart said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's task, as these voters saw it, was to present himself as a credible candidate and to showcase what many describe as his winning personality. Instead, Mr. Taggart and others said, he was unimpressive on the issues and testy.</p>
        <p>''He had an opportunity to get people who didn't know him to like him,'' Mr. Taggart said. ''I don't think he accomplished that, and it's a real opportunity lost for him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said his mind was still open, but less open than it had been the day before. ''If they debate again and something concrete comes out of Lazio, then there's a possibility,'' he said. ''But his chances of winning me  over are slipping away.''</p>
        <p>''I liked Hillary's professionalism,'' he continued, saying he was especially impressed by her cool in the face of Mr. Lazio's barbs. ''She was taking more than she was giving back, even though I could see he was getting to her. I think she came off better. She stuck to her guns and what she believes in.''</p>
