        <p>TWO weeks ago, we packed our daughter's sneakers, CD's, laptop and rice cooker and drove her to college, doing our bit to contribute to the biggest youth exodus since Woodstock. During the weeks bracketing Labor Day, more than 13 million students enrolled as college undergraduates, the first loud rumblings of a baby boom echo that will have social ramifications for years to come.</p>
        <p>Personal ramifications, too. Imagine our pangs the first time we caught a glimpse of our daughter's new home, where vegan is the preferred diet, ''clothing optional'' is a regular event and party invitations hang in hallways next to envelopes of condoms.</p>
        <p>Turning back toward New York in a rental van suddenly grown still, we wondered how our parents ever adjusted to life as proprietors of empty nests.</p>
        <p>And then we had an epiphany: we hadn't lost a daughter -- we had gained a room.</p>
        <p>When offspring leave, it creates a hole in the household, both physical and psychological. ''It means a whole stage of your life is over,'' said Audrey Goldsmith Kubie, a mother of three and a social worker in New York. She has kept her oldest daughter's bedroom pretty much intact since she enrolled at Duke University, six years ago.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, in cities where space is often in short supply, the departure of college-bound offspring opens up some valuable real estate. ''At first I just used his desk,'' said Dr. Jeannette Lofas, a family therapist, recalling the thrill of found space in her Manhattan apartment when her son left for college.</p>
        <p>Careful to respect borders, she resisted opening drawers and poking around. ''Then I moved in my PC,'' she said. By the time he graduated, the takeover was a fait accompli, and the boy's bedroom no longer contained a bed. When her son boomeranged back temporarily after college, she cast about for a new place to put him and finally found it ''in a back room.''</p>
        <p>Dale Burg, a New York writer, though careful not to let the words ''what I could get for this if I put it on the open market'' pass her lips in front of her son, started mentally overhauling the space he left over Labor Day weekend, when he entered Skidmore as a freshman. During his last two years of high school, he had been living in a studio apartment that is part of the family's Upper East Side co-op. ''Leaving it vacant, that's insane,'' said Ms. Burg, picturing its potential as a guest room. She suggested that he ''tidy up'' before taking off. Instead, he staked his turf (temporarily ruining it for anyone else) by leaving his shoes and other debris all over the floor, ''as if Vesuvius exploded and then it was frozen in time.''</p>
        <p>Real estate, a number of psychologists and family therapists explained, often has an emotional subtext.</p>
        <p>''Home is not only Mom and Dad, it's your room, too,'' said Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, a child psychiatrist and director of the Child Study Center at New York University. He still remembers his little sister trying to seize his bedroom when he left New York for the University of Maryland  30 years ago.</p>
        <p>''Separation is one of the major tasks of adolescence,'' he added. ''One thing we would counsel is, don't call the decorator right away.''</p>
        <p>My parents didn't call a decorator, but they didn't have to. The day after my college acceptance letter arrived, one of my brothers appeared in the doorway of my 9-by-9 suburban bedroom, carrying his collection of Rex Stout paperbacks and eyeing some display space where my mother and I had hung a single roll of  French wallpaper. He was squeezed into shared quarters and thought my monastic single would be an excellent place to spread his wings, the sooner the better. During school holidays I moved in with my sister. Frankly, I've repressed the details.</p>
        <p>At least my parents stayed put (the wallpaper, pocked with my brother's nail holes, hangs on). There are those parents who take what one psychologist termed the passive-aggressive route: while a child is away, they move.</p>
        <p>EVERY generation has to cope with the big handoff. What makes this year's high school graduates different is their commitment to higher education -- 65 percent will attend college, according to the United States Department of Education -- and their large numbers. Reflecting a growth spurt expected to peak around 2009, about four million Americans turn 18 this year, up from about 3.3 million in 1993.</p>
        <p>Many parents retain warm memories of coming home during their raucous college years to comforting pink chenille bedspreads or, more recently, ''Star Wars'' posters and Nirvana ticket stubs. Bryan Burkhart, a co-author of ''Airstream: A History of the Land Yacht'' (Chronicle Books), said he loved returning to San Diego well into his 20's and finding ''no real changes except for the sheets on the bed.'' His parents not only kept his younger siblings at bay but maintained this historic site until he was 30, ''all mine,'' he noted, ''archaeologically speaking.''</p>
        <p>The shrine syndrome can indicate other problems. Dr. David Lowenstein, a family therapist, said he sees many couples who preserve rooms as an emblem of a time when they didn't have to talk about (or even to) each other. Fragile marriages, he said, often crack under the strain of silence. ''They have done a great job as parents and forgotten how to be husband and wife.''</p>
        <p>Eventually most fledglings need an assertive nudge out of the nest, Dr. Koplewicz said, and once children are on their own, parents can go about their lives.</p>
        <p>Nothing says goodbye more clearly than emptying closets of sports trophies and prom dresses -- or taking down walls. Garry McGrath, an architect in St. Louis, said he does a brisk business redesigning empty suburban nests to incorporate long-deferred master bedroom suites and dream kitchens, with plenty of space for an espresso machine -- and a breakfast nook for two.</p>
        <p>But nests can't be rebuilt until children make a clean break, and college separations are often messy. Part of the problem, several family therapists said, is the way baby boomers rear their children.</p>
        <p>Dwelling on every detail of the lives of their offsprings, from first burp to last lines of college applications, baby boomers tend be both solicitous and expectant, as if their children were interesting extensions of themselves and their life work. When families also inhabit small dwellings, the intimacy can overwhelm children, forcing them to fight their way out.</p>
        <p>As college drew nearer, so did my daughter's secret identity. Shedding her nice-guy act, she seemed suddenly irritated to find me paging through one of her Cosmopolitan magazines, pausing to study ''Make Him Ache for You.'' Then came cruel attacks on my occasional memory lapses and less-than-perfect pocketbook-organizing skills.</p>
        <p>Carol Barkin, author of ''When Your Kid Goes to College: A Parent's Guide'' (Avon Books, 1999), said she was inspired to put pen to paper after her own son began to act  odd just before leaving. Friends related the same thing about their college-bound offspring. ''This was supposed to be this summer of family togetherness,'' she said one friend told her. ''My kid won't even talk to me long enough to say whether he needs extra-long sheets'' for the extra-long mattresses colleges have these days.</p>
        <p>Jo Ellyn Rackleff of Tallahassee, Fla., whose children are 16, 19 and 21, described the drama that occurred in seeing the older two off to college in New York.</p>
        <p>''They flop back and forth between incredibly childlike demands and assertions of their 'rights' as an adult,'' she said, adding: ''I think there is a natural impulse, maybe some kind of hormone that gets released, that makes the parent and child do everything to upset each other, so that the atmosphere in the nest is sufficiently toxic to allow the bond to break enough for them to fly.''</p>
        <p>Some parents use the term ''separation anxiety'' to describe the mutual feelings. While clinically inexact, the term is apt, said Dr. Nancy Giles, a psychologist in New York and the mother of three adult children. While working with a group of pediatricians many years ago, she tuned in to the way adults address 5-year-olds, clapping them on the back and saying heartily, ''You're going off to kindergarten! You're going to learn to read!''</p>
        <p>She said she often saw children hunched over as if bearing the weight of the world. ''We trumpet these milestones,'' she said, ''and nobody stops to say, 'Wait a minute, when you went to day care, you already accomplished being away from home part of the day.' ''</p>
        <p>Dr. Jeffrey Cohen, a psychiatrist in Stamford, Conn., said he had counseled a family whose only child had barely left when the parents announced they were splitting up, catching the son off guard. ''He got very angry with both of them,'' Dr. Cohen said, because ''separation was already an issue,'' and the parents had made it much worse.</p>
        <p>Even in solid families, breaking up is hard to do. Ms. Kubie, who is studying at N.Y.U. for a master's degree in social work, remembers the day she and her husband dropped off their firstborn at Duke. They had driven to Durham, N.C., from New York with a friend and her daughter, also enrolling at Duke, and the friend's housekeeper. ''We cried most of the way home,'' Mrs. Kubie said of the three women in the car, ''and it was a nine-hour trip.''</p>
        <p>Now that the Kubies' third and last child is looking at colleges, they have become philosophical. ''Every time one of the girls left home, we bought another dog,'' Mrs. Kubie said.</p>
        <p>Most parents weather the transition, said Dr. Robert L. Myers, a psychologist in Chester, Pa., but for others the departure of children can intensify the anxiety that 50-somethings face when they look back on life and wonder what they have to show for it. To ease this kind of post-parting depression, they head for the mall. Mom's in charge of finding those extra-long twin sheets, and Dad gets to exercise his wallet at the Wiz. This, of course, is the generation of parents more likely than their own to treat children as equals, taking them everywhere and conferring with them about every life decision and consumer purchase. And it may be one reason parents feel guilty when they experience an overwhelming desire to turn a child's private space into a retreat for watching television and lifting weights.</p>
        <p>Steve Salley, who designs houses on Cape Cod, sees a lot of interesting family dynamics played out on the drawing board. One couple communicated their late-in-life romance to children from their previous marriages by tearing down bedroom walls for a massive master bedroom.</p>
        <p>Parents in other popular student-destination cities report that it's not loneliness they suffer from but their taxing new roles as innkeepers. Blair and Helaine Kaplan Prentice, who run a design firm in Berkeley, Calif.,  gamely rose to the challenge when their son Asa brought three fraternity brothers home from M.I.T. this summer. To augment sleeping arrangements in the hillside house they designed when Asa and his brother were little, the Prentices borrowed mattresses from neighbors and jury-rigged a platform bed with plastic recycling bins. In August, as Asa was heading east for his sophomore year, his father was busy devising a system of couches that morph into beds.</p>
        <p>Other parents prepare long in advance. When their three children were still small, Georgiana Allan, a designer, and her husband, Jerry Allan, an architect, created a house  with maximum flexibility for their family in Afton, Minn. Ms. Allan designed an oversize bedroom for their artistically inclined daughter and a suite with two small bedrooms for the boys, with common space between, separated from the rest of the house by French doors. The notion was to create privacy during their teenage years (and ''when they come back with their own families,'' Mr. Allan said hopefully) and a room that could be converted for guests when their daughter left for college.</p>
        <p>We've acquired a few extra mattresses of our own, just in case our daughter pops in, bringing along her new family. And, of course, we have been kept busy: putting all our stuff back into her dresser, converting her bed back into our sofa and spreading out our paperwork everywhere. I have reunited with Henry James and  refamiliarized myself with the ceiling tiles at the corner gym; and my husband has begun redoing a closet.</p>
        <p>And we looked at the calendar: only 70 days till Thanksgiving.</p>
