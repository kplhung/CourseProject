        <p>On Wall Street, Chase Manhattan has long been considered an investment banking also-ran, disparaged by rivals as a declasse commercial bank. Now, with its proposed $30.9 billion purchase of J. P. Morgan, which was officially announced, Chase hopes that it will finally break into the club of financial firms with enduring global influence.</p>
        <p>Chase executives argue that the combination of Chase's broad base of customers with Morgan's exclusive clientele and financial expertise will prevent the two banks from being left behind in the race to determine which firms will dominate corporate finance.</p>

        <p>On Wall Street, Chase Manhattan has long been considered an investment banking also-ran, disparaged by rivals as a declasse commercial bank. Now, with its proposed $30.9 billion purchase of J. P. Morgan, which was officially announced, Chase hopes that it will finally break into the club of financial firms with enduring global influence.</p>
        <p>Chase executives argue that the combination of Chase's broad base of customers with Morgan's exclusive clientele and financial expertise will prevent the two banks from being left behind in the race to determine which firms will dominate corporate finance.</p>
        <p>Investors are not yet buying that argument. Chase's stock price has fallen 12 percent over the last two days, after speculation about the deal began to spread. There may be good reasons for such a reaction: Chase is paying a hefty premium over market value, and financial services mergers often run into problems of integration.</p>
