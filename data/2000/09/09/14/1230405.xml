        <p>A Side Dish Of Rodent</p>
        <p>JAMES CARVILLE went to dinner with a bunch of HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON people, including BOB BARNETT, MANDY GRUNWALD, MARK PENN and HOWARD WOLFSON, at his favorite restaurant in New York, the Gramercy Tavern.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carville took a quick glance at the menu and ordered: an heirloom tomato tart and striped sea bass with prosciutto. Then TOM COLICCHIO, the chef and a co-owner with DANNY MEYER, came to the table (Mr. Carville is a regular) and suggested -- or insisted -- that he take a closer look at his menu, particularly the listing for the tuna tartar with sea urchin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carville slipped his reading glasses on his nose, drew the menu to his face and found a surprise ingredient listed: rat.</p>
        <p>In fact, there were rats all over the menu, so to speak. His hosts at the restaurant, knowing that he was coming in, printed a special menu for him to commemorate a certain Republican advertisement by the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>Adding Profile To Actors' Strike</p>
        <p>PAUL NEWMAN and TIM ROBBINS pulled together a small circle of friends yesterday for a rally in Midtown on behalf of 135,000 actors who have been on strike against the advertising industry for more than four months. Their small group of friends included KEVIN BACON, PHILIP BOSCO, RICHARD DREYFUSS, OLYMPIA DUKAKIS, CELESTE HOLM, ROBERT KLEIN, JOHN LEGUIZAMO, SUSAN SARANDON, ELI WALLACH and TREAT WILLIAMS.</p>
        <p>Before some 1,000 members of the two striking unions, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Actors, the group told jokes, shouted ''Union! Union!'' and pledged to step up their support.</p>
        <p>''They've been on strike nearly five months and nobody knows about it,'' Mr. Newman said, standing in front of the office tower at 51st Street and Avenue of the Americas where the advertising agency BBD&amp;O New York has its headquarters.</p>
        <p>At least 500 New Yorkers looked on as a well-tanned Mr. Newman and a bearded Mr. Robbins emulated Samuel Gompers.</p>
        <p>The main issue in the dispute is how to pay actors for appearing in commercials. The advertising industry is seeking to end longstanding rules governing residuals, but union officials argue that this would badly hurt actors, who they say average $5,000 a year from commercials.</p>
        <p>''We're not talking about a bunch of rich people striking,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''These commercials put bread on the table for these people.''</p>
        <p>A Voter Poll; One Constituent</p>
        <p>KATE HUDSON, who plays a groupie in the film ''Almost Famous,'' which opened yesterday, was at the premiere party with her mother, GOLDIE HAWN, at a re-creation of Max's Kansas City (it was really the bar Centro Fly). CAMERON CROWE, the director of the film, attended with his wife, NANCY WILSON, the rock singer, and with FRANCES McDORMAND, who plays his mother in the film, and her husband, JOEL COEN. (It can seem a little ingrown.)</p>
        <p>Pretty much the same crew was on hand last week to present the film at the Toronto Film Festival. Ms. McDormand stayed on in Toronto to catch a few films. One particular favorite was ''The Contender,'' which opens next month and stars JOAN ALLEN as a senator who faces charges of sexual impropriety during a confirmation hearing on her appointment as vice president by President Jackson Evans (JEFF BRIDGES).</p>
        <p>The film has gotten advance buzz about Oscar nominations for several of the performances, including the one by GARY OLDMAN, playing a conservative politician who heads the examining committee.</p>
        <p>''I just loved Joan Allen in that,'' Ms. McDormand confided at the party Monday. ''I'd vote for her and Jeff Bridges in a moment.''</p>
        <p>For the Academy Awards?</p>
        <p>She looked shocked.</p>
        <p>''No,'' she said, ''For president and vice president. That's much more important, don't you think?''</p>
