        <p>A car bomb exploded in the parking garage of the Indonesian Stock Exchange building yesterday, killing 15 people and wounding dozens in this troubled country's newest brush with violence.</p>
        <p>The unexplained explosion was the latest of a series in recent weeks in Jakarta and other cities.</p>
        <p>It came hours before a high-profile corruption trial against Indonesia's former president, Suharto, resumed today. He failed to appear in court, citing ill health, as he did on Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>A Jakarta police detective said anecdotal evidence linked the car bomb to the case against Mr. Suharto.</p>
        <p>The night before the trial opened on Aug. 31, a car bomb exploded 300 yards from a south Jakarta building where the case was being tried.</p>
        <p>The detective, Harry Montolalu, told reporters at the scene, ''This is being done to create instability.''</p>
        <p>But the national police chief, Gen. Rusdihardjo, refused to theorize about the involvement of anyone linked to Mr. Suharto or his trial.</p>
        <p>''As long as we haven't caught the suspects yet and the motive is still not clear, we shouldn't conclude that way,'' the general said.</p>
        <p>President Abdurrahman Wahid has accused Suharto-affiliated military and political extremists of planting bombs and inciting unrest across the country to discredit him and destabilize his democratically elected government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wahid said elements within the army were responsible for an attack last week that killed three foreign aid workers at a United Nations refugee agency office in West Timor.</p>
        <p>The country's attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, who spent eight months investigating the Suharto family, has gone further. He contends that Suharto supporters were instigating violence in order to derail the corruption trial and undermine inquiries into rights abuses by the military, in East Timor and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darusman said those incidents included an explosion at his office building in July, one hour after Mr. Suharto's youngest son was questioned in connection with the corruption case against his father. No one was injured in that blast.</p>
        <p>Indonesia's short-staffed and poorly equipped police force has failed to name a single suspect in any of the incidents, and the explosion yesterday was expected to increase international pressure on Mr. Wahid to restore order in his country of 210 million people.</p>
        <p>General Rusdihardjo (who like many Indonesians goes by one name) said, ''I apologize for not being able to solve the previous explosion cases, but trust me, the Indonesian police are doing our best and we will guarantee an improvement of security.''</p>
        <p>The explosion occurred at 3:17 p.m. on the second basement level of the 36-story building's underground parking garage in Jakarta's central business district.</p>
        <p>More than 1,000 people fled the building as the blast reverberated and black smoke billowed from the parking garage entrance.</p>
        <p>At least 27 people were treated at a nearby hospital, which soon overflowed with casualties. The police and other officials gave conflicting reports on the number of deaths.</p>
        <p>Firefighters battled an underground blaze in the garage that was apparently started by a power generator damaged in the explosion.</p>
        <p>Smoke inhalation caused at least five of the deaths. Some people had apparently hidden in their cars in hopes of escaping the fire. Rescue workers pulled at least three burned bodies from car wreckage.</p>
        <p>''It is confirmed that the explosion came from a bomb in a car,'' the police spokesman, Nur Usman, said.</p>
        <p>The bombing appeared to further erode public faith in the country's security forces, reinforcing the perception that the government is losing control of Indonesia, the world's fourth-largest nation.</p>
        <p>''I think what has happened is that the capacity of the security forces to control this has really broken down,'' said Andi Mallarangeng, a leading political analyst, who added that he had been in the stock exchange building two hours before the explosion.</p>
