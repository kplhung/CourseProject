        <p>For even the most promising young race horses, it is a long way to the Breeders' Cup (six weeks) and the Kentucky Derby (seven months). But it seemed even longer at Belmont Park yesterday for the trainers of the heavy favorites in the prime races for juveniles: Raging Fever in the Matron and City Zip in the Futurity.</p>
        <p>The horses crossed the line first in their races, as expected, but they raised more questions than they answered. Raging Fever stayed undefeated in the Matron, winning her fourth straight race, but she came within a head of blowing a six-length lead to the fast-closing filly Dancinginmydreams.</p>

        <p>For even the most promising young race horses, it is a long way to the Breeders' Cup (six weeks) and the Kentucky Derby (seven months). But it seemed even longer at Belmont Park yesterday for the trainers of the heavy favorites in the prime races for juveniles: Raging Fever in the Matron and City Zip in the Futurity.</p>
        <p>The horses crossed the line first in their races, as expected, but they raised more questions than they answered. Raging Fever stayed undefeated in the Matron, winning her fourth straight race, but she came within a head of blowing a six-length lead to the fast-closing filly Dancinginmydreams.</p>
        <p>Then it was City Zip's turn to tangle with fate in the Futurity. Undefeated in his last four starts, and one of those rare horses to win all three stakes for 2-year-olds at Saratoga, he beat the long shot Burning Roma by a nose to the finish. But he was disqualified by the stewards for wandering across the track in the homestretch and bumping into Burning Roma, who was ultimately ruled the winner, with City Zip demoted to second.</p>
        <p>To deepen the puzzle, both favorites ran rather slow miles in races billed as career-builders. Raging Fever, trained by Mark Hennig with Jerry Bailey riding, completed her mile in 1:381/5 ; City Zip, trained by Linda Rice with Jose Santos riding, completed his in 1:374/5 .</p>
        <p>''I think the stewards made the right call,'' Rice acknowledged. ''Jose switched sticks to his left hand and bumped the other horse twice. He allowed City Zip to drift out a little to intimidate the others and disrupt their run, but it may have been an exaggerated move. It looked like City Zip would have dug in and won anyway.''</p>
        <p>Santos, accepting the blame, said: ''I simply hit him too hard and he drifted out. My colt ran a huge race. It's my fault that he got disqualified.''</p>
        <p>But Rick Wilson, the jockey on Burning Roma, had a different view of the finish: ''We were going to run by City Zip anyway.''</p>
        <p>Burning Roma, trained by Tony Dutrow, paid $37 for a $2 bet to win and stayed undefeated in three starts. Scorpion, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, finished nearly five lengths back in third.</p>
        <p>Then, in the Matron, the fillies provided a finish almost as surprising as the colts' closing battle in the Futurity. Raging Fever was bumped at the start, recovered and stayed on the heels of Major Wager, then took charge as they turned for home. Bailey, her jockey, at one point opened a lead of seven lengths.</p>
        <p>''We got to mid-stretch,'' Bailey said, ''and I was trying to get my filly to pick it up some more, but she thought it was over. That's something I'll have to be mindful of next time.''</p>
        <p>It wasn't over by a long shot. Roaring up from deep in the pack came Dancinginmydreams, with Pat Day riding, and after a furious charge she drew almost even with Raging Fever. But the favorite still had her head in front as they hit the finish, with Ilusoria nine lengths back in third.</p>
        <p>''I was concerned that Jerry didn't see the other filly making a run at her,'' Hennig said. ''He geared her down, and I thought the other filly might get to us. In the stretch, she was looking at the grandstand. The experience will be good for her and Jerry; next time, he'll know not to gear her down as much.''</p>
        <p>Shug McGaughey, who trains Dancinginmydreams for Ogden Phipps, noted that his filly was making only her second start, and added with some wonder: ''I didn't think she had a shot at the top of the stretch.''</p>
