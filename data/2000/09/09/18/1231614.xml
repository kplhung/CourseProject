        <p>AT&amp;T to Consider Strategy At Annual Board Retreat  As AT&amp;T's board prepares for its annual retreat, where many of the company's most important decisions have taken shape in recent years, the participants will most likely be discussing options meant to underline the value of the company's relatively strong operations, like its cable unit, while quarantining the performance of the relative laggards, like consumer long-distance.</p>
        <p>Analysts and investors have also wondered about more exotic possibilities, like a full or partial merger of AT&amp;T and British Telecommunications, as the company seeks ways to bolster a stock that closed at $32.25 last week, compared with more than $60 at one point last spring. Market Place. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Athletes' Fund Raises $150 Million  Champion Ventures, the investment fund for professional athletes started by two former San Francisco 49ers, has finished its second round of financing in as many years, raising $150 million. That is a considerable sum given that last year Ronnie Lott, left, who founded Champion with Harris Barton, raised $40 million from football stars like Keyshawn Johnson and hockey players like Wayne Gretzky. Champion invests money in the funds of some of the most prestigious venture capitalists, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Accel Partners. [C9.]</p>

        <p>Military Agency's Technology Payoff  For more than 40 years, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has parceled out billions of dollars for research projects, and no other organization has so frequently if unintentionally served as midwife to the technologies of today's information-driven economy.
