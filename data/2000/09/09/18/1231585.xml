        <p>Naim Suleymanoglu is 33 years old, smokes 50 cigarettes daily for his inner peace and won the gold medal in weight lifting in the featherweight class in three consecutive Olympics.</p>
        <p>Suleymanoglu, the 136-pound Bulgarian known as the Pocket Hercules, who became an athletic icon in his adopted Turkey, seemed invulnerable to age and the inevitable fraying of legend.</p>
        <p>But three times last night, Suleymanoglu tried to raise 319 pounds in one move over his head in the snatch segment of the Olympic weight lifting competition. Each time, he failed. His myth of Olympic invincibility concluded when he could not advance to the clean-and-jerk phase.</p>
        <p>Maybe it was the years of retirement since his 1996 victory at the Atlanta Summer Games before his return last year. Or maybe it was the hubris of choosing to start the snatch at 319 pounds, the highest weight of the 11 competitors.</p>
        <p>Now Suleymanoglu has an Olympic successor. Nikolay Pechalov, 30, also a native Bulgarian, who emigrated to Croatia three years ago, is the featherweight champion, which has a 137-pound limit. In victory, Pechalov set Olympic records for the snatch, hoisting 330 pounds, and for his 715-pound total. His defection to Croatia was occasioned by a $50,000 payment to the Bulgarian weight lifting federation.</p>
        <p>''He still thinks Naim is still the greatest weight lifter on the planet,'' an interpreter said for Pechalov. ''They have been friends for 16 years and will continue to be friends, but competition is a different story.''</p>
        <p>The silver medal was won by Leonidas Sabanis of Greece, who also won silver in Atlanta in the 130-pound bantamweight class. Sevdalin Minchev Angelov, of Bulgaria, won the bronze.</p>
        <p>VOLLEYBALL  U.S. Team Upset</p>
        <p>Argentina stunned the United States, 24-26, 25-23, 25-21, 25-18, possibly ruining the American men's hopes for a medal.</p>
        <p>The American team came to Sydney looking to rekindle its glory days of the 1980's. Instead, it might leave with its second straight Olympic disappointment after winning gold in 1984 and 1988 and the world title in 1986. (AP)</p>
        <p>SHOOTING  An Emotional Victory</p>
        <p>Michael Diamond of Australia broke down in tears with thoughts of his father after winning his second consecutive Olympic trap shooting gold medal.</p>
        <p>''This was for Dad,'' Diamond said. His father, Con, was also a shooter and died earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Diamond ended with a score of 147, going 25 for 25 in the final. He also had a perfect score in the qualifying Saturday.</p>
        <p>Ian Peel of Britain was second with 142, and Giovanni Pellielo of Italy was third with 140.</p>
        <p>Tao Luna of China won the women's 10-meter air pistol. Jasna Sekavic, a gold medalist at the 1988 Olympics for Yugoslavia, was second, with Annemarie Forder of Australia third. (AP)</p>
        <p>FENCING  Hungarian Wins</p>
        <p>Timea Nagy of Hungary, a five-time team world champion, scored a late touch in the third period to beat Switzerland's Gianna Hadlutzel-Burki by 15-11 for the Olympic gold in the women's individual epee.</p>
        <p>Nagy registered the final point with five seconds left in the last period. Teammates carried her off and tossed her into the air.  (AP)</p>
        <p>TRIATHLON  Unfazed by a Crash</p>
        <p>Simon Whitfield of Canada crashed during the cycling portion but got up to win the men's triathlon.</p>
        <p>He rallied after a 15-rider crash on the final lap of the bike race through downtown Sydney, then sprinted past Germany's Stephan Vuckovic in the final 200 meters of the running segment. He won in 1:48:24. Jan Rehula of the Czech Republic won the bronze. (AP)</p>
