      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges Congress to establish uniform national standard for drunken driving along lines suggested by Sen Frank Lautenberg, which would require states to lower standards for drunken driving to .08 blood alcohol concentration or lose portion of federal highway money (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An important fight over highway safety is heating up on Capitol Hill. At issue is a sensible measure long championed by Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, to establish a uniform national standard for drunken driving. The measure, whose fate now rests with the House-Senate conference committee working on the transportation appropriations bill, would require states to lower their standards for drunken driving to a .08 blood alcohol concentration within three years or lose a portion of their federal highway money.</p>
        <p>In theory, the provision should sail into law. The idea of making .08 the national standard for intoxication enjoys broad bipartisan support in Congress and in public opinion polls. It has the backing of the Clinton administration, the conference committee's Republican chairman, Representative Frank Wolf, and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Richard Shelby. It also has strong backing from medical and highway-safety experts, who note that a blood alcohol level of .08, though still producing impaired reflexes, is preferable to a level of .10, the limit in many states. Moving to a nationwide limit of .08, studies suggest, would save about 500 lives a year.</p>

        <p>An important fight over highway safety is heating up on Capitol Hill. At issue is a sensible measure long championed by Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, to establish a uniform national standard for drunken driving. The measure, whose fate now rests with the House-Senate conference committee working on the transportation appropriations bill, would require states to lower their standards for drunken driving to a .08 blood alcohol concentration within three years or lose a portion of their federal highway money.</p>
        <p>In theory, the provision should sail into law. The idea of making .08 the national standard for intoxication enjoys broad bipartisan support in Congress and in public opinion polls. It has the backing of the Clinton administration, the conference committee's Republican chairman, Representative Frank Wolf, and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Richard Shelby. It also has strong backing from medical and highway-safety experts, who note that a blood alcohol level of .08, though still producing impaired reflexes, is preferable to a level of .10, the limit in many states. Moving to a nationwide limit of .08, studies suggest, would save about 500 lives a year.</p>
        <p>The outcome now turns on the willingness of lawmakers to stand up for the public interest in the face of intense pressure from special interests -- in this case the alcohol and restaurant lobbies. In previous debates on this issue, the moneyed private interests prevailed. To avoid another defeat, President Clinton will need to intensify White House pressure to approve the life-saving change.</p>
        <p>Also on the safety front, language buried in the Senate version of the transportation bill would badly hamper the government's response to two key causes of highway crashes. One provision would remove the Transportation Department's authority to prepare regulations limiting the number of hours truckers may drive without a rest. Another would postpone the issuance of information to consumers about the rollover propensity of various types of vehicles, including sport utility vehicles. The conference committee should drop these provisions, and then achieve a safety advance by extending the .08 blood alcohol limit nationwide.</p>
