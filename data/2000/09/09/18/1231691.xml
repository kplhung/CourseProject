        <p>Two agency companies are making acquisitions for undisclosed terms.</p>
        <p>Wolf Group Integrated Communications in Toronto is acquiring Viaduct Technologies in Bethesda, Md., which is being merged with Wolf Interactive to form an interactive agency named Viaduct.</p>
        <p>The merged Viaduct, which will be majority owned by Wolf and based in New York, will have 120 employees and revenue estimated at $30 million from clients like Hewlett-Packard and the Hudson's Bay Company. Scott Brown, 43, chief executive at Wolf Interactive, becomes chief executive at Viaduct, and Eric Litman, 28, chief executive at Viaduct Technologies, becomes chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>And the Omnicom Group in New York is buying Steiner Sports Marketing in New York, which has 55 employees and revenue estimated at more than $20 million from clients like American Express and Chase. Steiner Sports also works with active and retired athletes like Ralph Branca, Carlton Fisk, Derek Jeter, Mia Hamm, Mark Messier and Bobby Thomson. Steiner Sports will operate as an autonomous unit of Omnicom and Brandon Steiner, 41, will continue as chairman.</p>
        <p>The acquisition comes after Omnicom acquired an equity stake in Horrow Sports Ventures in Palm Beach, Fla., a consulting company that specializes in developing sports and entertainment facilities.</p>
