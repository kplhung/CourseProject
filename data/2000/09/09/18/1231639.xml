        <p>Leaders of Asian-American groups are planning to seize the opportunity of a long-scheduled meeting with White House officials in New York on Monday to express their outrage over the treatment of the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee and to press for a full inquiry on whether racism played a role in his investigation and prosecution.</p>
        <p>When the White House Initiative on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders set up a daylong town meeting many weeks ago, to be held in an auditorium at the New York University Law School, it was intended as a forum for the Clinton administration to put on display its interest in hearing from the rapidly growing Asian-American population.</p>
        <p>A similar meeting about six weeks ago in Los Angeles was sparsely attended, some participants said, and several said they had been warned then that they were not to raise the issue of Dr. Lee, who pleaded guilty last week to one count of mishandling nuclear secrets after more than nine months of solitary confinement.</p>
        <p>But some Asian-American leaders held a series of caucuses over the weekend and said they intended to take advantage of the time set aside for public comment at the Monday meeting to demand that the administration initiate an investigation into whether Dr. Lee was singled out because he is ethnically Chinese.</p>
        <p>''We are calling for an impartial investigation on whether there was racial profiling, and we think this is a good forum for making sure we are heard,'' said Laura Hong, president of the National Asian Pacific American Bar Association. A number of officials from the administration are scheduled to attend the conference.</p>
        <p>Added Henry Tang, president of the Committee of 100, an organization of Chinese-Americans, ''The focus is on full disclosure of all the documents on racial profiling.''</p>
        <p>Dr. David Ho, a highly regarded researcher and director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, is a commissioner of the White House organization, and he said that previously the group was discouraged from raising questions about Dr. Lee by administration officials on the grounds that it was a pending criminal case. But now that it is not, he said, ''I think if we don't tackle this issue we will have no credibility'' among Asian-Americans.</p>
        <p>These leaders were referring to one of the most important developments in Dr. Lee's case. The judge, James A. Parker of Federal District Court in Albuquerque, had earlier ordered the government to hand over thousands of pages of classified documents detailing why Dr. Lee was singled out for investigation and how his case was handled compared with those of other government employees who violated security rules.</p>
        <p>Those documents were due by last Friday. With Dr. Lee's plea agreement on Wednesday to one count of mishandling nuclear secrets, the judge's order was dropped. Judge Parker himself said he regretted that he would no longer be able to order the disclosure of the documents, and many others have insisted that the documents should still be examined for evidence of racism.</p>
        <p>Many Asian-American leaders said they had been eager to find a forum to speak directly to the Clinton White House about their deep concerns over the way Dr. Lee was prosecuted, and the town meeting in New York has provided a venue.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee was investigated for years on suspicion that he had leaked nuclear weapons secrets to China, and he was fired from his job at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in March 1999. However, no evidence could ever be found to support the allegations. But F.B.I. agents searching his home eventually found that he had improperly downloaded a huge volume of nuclear secrets. He was indicted last December on 59 felony counts of having illegally downloaded the data with the intent of helping a foreign country. The charges could have brought him a life sentence.</p>
        <p>Though Dr. Lee's plea last Wednesday, which gave him his freedom in return for his cooperation with investigators, ended the prosecution, Judge Parker lectured the government on what he characterized as its disturbing handling of Dr. Lee and its misleading testimony.</p>
        <p>That helped fuel the calls for an investigation, which are expected to transform what might have been a routine meeting on Monday into a rally on Dr. Lee's behalf.</p>
