        <p>John Hart, the Cleveland general manager, spent some time on the telephone yesterday, asking major league officials why, considering a new scheduling development involving the Oakland Athletics, the Indians should have to play a makeup game as part of a day-night doubleheader next Monday.

        <p>John Hart, the Cleveland general manager, spent some time on the telephone yesterday, asking major league officials why, considering a new scheduling development involving the Oakland Athletics, the Indians should have to play a makeup game as part of a day-night doubleheader next Monday. ''He's trying, but he's not making any headway,'' another Indians official said.</p>
        <p>Over their objection, the Indians have been directed to play the Chicago White Sox in Cleveland next Monday afternoon even though they already had a night game scheduled against the Minnesota Twins. Major league officials, in agreement with the players association, did not want to wait to see if the White Sox-Indians game became crucial to the playoff race, and if so to play it the day after the end of the season.</p>
        <p>But then the threat of a hurricane in Florida prompted postponement of yesterday's scheduled game between the Athletics and the Devil Rays in St. Petersburg. That game has been rescheduled for the day after the season ends, if it is critical to the outcome of either the American League West or wild-card race.</p>
        <p>When Hart heard about that arrangement, he asked why the Indians could not also wait until Oct. 2 to play their makeup.</p>
        <p>''It's something we need to talk about,'' said Katy Feeney, a major league official in charge of scheduling. ''Now that we've scheduled it, we should get the game in. I know it's tough on the teams involved, but as tight as things are, I don't know if we'd want to call it back. But I don't have an answer right now.''</p>
        <p>Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the players association, did not seem inclined to agree to a change. ''My initial reaction is that day is virtually sacrosanct,'' Orza said, meaning the day after the regular season. ''You give it out only when you're forced to give it out. You don't go back in time and say as long as I'm using that day I'll give it to someone else who already has been scheduled.''</p>
        <p>Instead of changing the Indians game, officials may try to find a way to make up the Athletics game even though Oakland has no days off the rest of the season. The Indians are half a game ahead of the Athletics in the wild-card standing.</p>
