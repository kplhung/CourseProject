        <p>Of the many cultural differences between the United States and Japan, one of the most noticeable is the approach to baseball pitchers.</p>
        <p>American starters are, by and large, treated like hothouse plants, whereas Japanese starters are expected to be old-fashioned warriors, on call day or night, inning after inning.</p>
        <p>The gap between these two grand baseball nations is apparent in the Summer Games tournament. The United States used five pitchers in 13 innings during the 4-2 victory over Japan this afternoon, winning the opener when Mike Neill, a minor league journeyman, blasted a two-run homer.</p>
        <p>Japan used only two pitchers, including Daisuke Matsuzaka, the hottest young pitcher in that country, who worked the first 10 innings.</p>
        <p>Matsuzaka, who just turned 20 on Wednesday, is handsome, confident, popular and talented. The public cannot get enough of him, and neither can his managers. A right-hander, he faced 39 batters, gave up 8 hits, 2 walks and struck out 5, and probably threw around 135 pitches, which is extremely high for American pitchers of that age. Only the highest-paid veteran starters stay in the game that long in the States.</p>
        <p>But Matsuzaka has pitched longer than that. When he was in high school in Yokohama in 1998, he pitched two games early in the fabled high school tournament at ivy-covered Koshien Stadium near Osaka. Then he pitched 17 innings in the quarterfinal game, when he was said to have thrown 175 pitches, and he worked three more innings in the semifinal and pitched a no-hitter in the final.</p>
        <p>His exploits made him a national hero, and earned him a big bonus from the Seibu Lions, in the suburbs of Tokyo. While he had hoped to be drafted by the Yomiuri Giants, he took the bonus from the Lions, and extracted the right to play in the Summer Games. Japanese officials picked seven other players to leave the pennant races in their major leagues.</p>
        <p>Matsuzaka more than lived up to his notices today, and the Americans were impressed.</p>
        <p>''He was throwing well, and we were hoping he would throw a few more innings,'' said Neill, who was hitless in 15 at-bats in a brief stint for Oakland in 1998.</p>
        <p>''It showed how much they wanted to win,'' said Pat Borders, who caught in two World Series victories with Toronto but did not play today. ''That's just what they're accustomed to. I don't know about their injury rate, but they don't lack for work.''</p>
        <p>American starting pitchers are generally icing up their arms and taking extensive treatment in the trainer's room by the seventh inning or so, leaving it up to assorted long men, left-handed specialists, setup men and closers. Matsuzaka just kept going. ''There was no special treatment,'' after he came out of the game, he said via an interpreter. ''And I don't ice my arm.''</p>
        <p>This would be heresy in the States, but Tom Lasorda, manager of the American team, showed a bit of heretic in him when asked what he thought about using a 20-year-old for 10 full innings.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe in pitch counts,'' Lasorda said. ''We lost our counter, so I have no idea how long they worked. That pitcher was outstanding. I think that's the way it should be. I think a young pitcher has to strengthen his arm to get better. It's like a boxer. To strengthen your legs, you have to box. He pitched a heck of a game, but I'm not surprised.''</p>
        <p>Lasorda was well aware that Matsuzaka won 16 and lost 5 in 180 innings as a rookie and that this year he had a 12-7 record in 148 2/3 innings. Matsuzaka will be eligible for free agency in eight years -- if his arm holds up.</p>
        <p>He came within one out of being the losing pitcher. The United States took a 2-0 lead in the seventh. John Cotton tripled and scored on a single by Mike Kinkade. Kinkade advanced to third on a single by Doug Mientkiewicz and eventually scored when Matsuzaka did not hold him on third base on Marcus Jensen's comebacker to the mound.</p>
        <p>Ben Sheets, a prospect in the Milwaukee system, pitched seven scoreless innings, but Japan scored on a triple and an infield out as soon as he was removed.</p>
        <p>Then in the ninth, Norihiro Nakamura, a powerful star with the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes, led off with a single. With two outs, Japan got two singles on swinging rollers that barely got as far as the mound. On the second one, third baseman Kinkade fielded the ball barehanded and threw wildly past first base as the tying run scored.</p>
        <p>Matsuzaka worked two more innings, then yielded to Toshiya Sugiuchi. In the bottom of the 13th, Brad Wilkerson walked and went to second on a wild pitch. Then Neill blasted the two-run homer -- wooden bats, not aluminum, were used for the first time in the Olympics -- to right field that ended the game and made a rather undramatic tour of the bases, explaining later that he was hot and tired and just glad the game was over.</p>
        <p>The round-robin tournament continues with games every day. Daisuke Matsuzaka will surely be heard from again.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The 13-inning game was the longest Olympic game since baseball became a medal sport at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain. . . . Cuba, the two-time reigning Olympic champion, routed South Africa, 16-0. The Cubans had 18 hits, while NORGE LUIS VERA and two relief pitchers combined for a no-hitter in a game halted after seven innings under the 10-run mercy rule.</p>
