        <p>Now that voters have finally begun to pay close attention to the presidential race, many strategists say that Gov. George W. Bush has to be particularly careful not to lose control of what has long been his most potent advantage over Vice President Al Gore: his personal image.</p>
        <p>For all the debate over who has the most gripping television commercials, an important way to see how a campaign is performing is in the day-to-day media coverage. By that measure, Mr. Gore has enjoyed nearly a month of flattering attention, and Mr. Bush -- while still neck and neck in the polls -- has been portrayed as a candidate struggling to recover from verbal flubs and tactical blunders, some of his own making and some entirely beyond his control.</p>
        <p>The challenge for the Bush campaign, according to some of his own advisers and Republicans outside the campaign, is to prevent the public from developing the perception that he is not quite ready for prime time.</p>
        <p>The longtime view of many of these Republicans has been that Mr. Bush's political attraction is anchored as much in his personality as in his stands on issues: They say he comes across as a regular, upbeat guy without pretension, one who is appealingly self-confident and responsible, and one who is not afraid to say when he does not have an answer.</p>
        <p>The success of his ''compassionate conservative'' mantra was that Mr. Bush was not a scowling extremist but a sunny and appealing politician who could effectively carry the conservative message.</p>
        <p>Now, some of Mr. Bush's supporters and advisers sense that these appealing traits have not broken  through to voters. From his tongue-twisted explanations of his tax plan to his reluctance to accept a bipartisan commission's roster of debates and even to his vulgar comment about a reporter, Mr. Bush has seemed defensive, lacking in humor and easily flappable, these supporters say.</p>
        <p>Don Sipple, a Republican media consultant who worked for Mr. Bush when he ran for governor of Texas, said, ''If there is a substantial deterioration in voters' perceptions of his personal traits that is met with a commensurate rise on the part of Gore, that becomes very problematic.''</p>
        <p>''His personal qualities had so much to do with his ascent on the national stage,'' Mr. Sipple added,  ''and he needs to take great care in preserving those.''</p>
        <p>Michael K. Deaver, who was an image consultant for Ronald Reagan, said Mr. Bush's challenge reminded him of what his boss faced in 1980, when he was widely derided after saying that 80 percent of air pollution came from plants and trees.</p>
        <p>''We had the problem of so-called misstatements and the jokes on late-night television,'' Mr. Deaver said. ''When you get into this you have to change your message dramatically. Bush has got some vulnerability on misspeaking and mispronouncing. The media are looking at him in a different way, and he has to be cognizant of that.''</p>
        <p>Most polls so far show that the movement has been in Mr. Gore's column. He is gaining in popularity, and likability, while Mr. Bush is holding his own. But beyond the overall numbers, some pollsters in both parties said they had detected signs of erosion in how the governor is viewed as a person.</p>
        <p>Now that the months of publicity about Mr. Gore's inability to connect with voters has subsided in the glow of the Democratic National Convention and tightened polls, Democrats are happy to pronounce Mr. Bush as the one with the problem.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials made available a party poll of likely voters, completed on Thursday, in which respondents were asked whether Mr. Bush ''sometimes seems a little arrogant.'' While voters were divided on that question, the Democrats said they found an increase of several percentage points since the Republican convention in the number of people who said yes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's ratings have shifted so fast, and so unexpectedly, that the newly warm feelings voters have toward him could evaporate. Last week, the Bush camp was clearly trying to nudge such a shift along, as it pointed to fresh accusations about the Democrats' solicitation of money from trial lawyers.</p>
        <p>Q. Whitfield Ayres, a Republican pollster, insisted that Mr. Bush's image troubles were the imagination of the media. ''The disparaging, sneering image of Governor Bush that you sense among the media elite is not reflected by most voters,'' Mr. Ayres said. ''That's why he maintains his strength in the polls.''</p>
        <p>That may be the case. But there is no mistaking that these days, antics of Mr. Gore that might have been seen as forced and silly a month ago now are being described through the prism of the media and the pundits as evidence that the vice president, finally, is now comfortable allowing people to see his true disposition.</p>
        <p>Right or wrong, officials in both campaigns agreed that perceptions about a candidate's stature, personality and electoral strength could be as critical to voters as the candidate's stands on issues.</p>
        <p>Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said in an interview weeks ago that both sides had to take care because if one candidate was seen to be on an upswing, voters might be tempted to join up with a winner.</p>
        <p>The swing voters who decide elections, Mr. Rove explained, are ''people largely driven less by issues and more by personalities and the so-called bandwagon effect: who looks like they're going to win.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best evidence that the Bush campaign is now worried about Mr. Bush's image -- or no longer sees that as his No. 1 advantage -- is its decision to focus more attention on issues and less on raising questions about Mr. Gore's character. But even some Bush advisers acknowledge that the strategy may be perilous because polls show that voters generally give Democrats higher marks on the issues.</p>
        <p>There is something of a circular phenomenon here. Mr. Bush's gaffes on the stump are nothing new, but they are being picked up more by the media because the context of the campaign has changed and the governor is no longer viewed as the towering favorite. The more critical coverage could contribute to a damaging of Mr. Bush's image, which, if reflected in the polls, could result in  still more critical coverage.</p>
        <p>''Bush picked the worst time to start getting terrible press,'' said S. Robert Lichter, director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs. ''Journalists are setting the story line for the whole campaign.''</p>
        <p>''When you're doing well,'' he explained, ''journalists don't focus on your gaffes or goofs because they don't seem to make any difference. When he starts to falter, the residue of stereotypes comes back into play: that Bush is a lightweight.''</p>
        <p>Bush officials have privately said that their biggest fear was that people would begin to question their candidate's weightiness. Now, many Republicans said, with the Olympics in progress, they are particularly worried that Mr. Bush will probably  not have a chance to define himself better until the first of his three debates with Mr. Gore, on Oct. 3.</p>
        <p>''The next real step for Bush is to make a good showing at the debates,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. ''Bush is in the same kind of dangerous slide that Dukakis was in in '88 when he jumped into the tank and put the funny hat on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Deaver insisted there was ample time for the Bush camp to protect how he is perceived. The campaign, he said, should assert stricter control over Mr. Bush's public appearances and press for bolder events and policy proposals.</p>
        <p>''They have to do something that's different and dramatic,'' Mr. Deaver said.</p>
        <p>Asked what would that be, he replied, ''I don't know.''</p>
