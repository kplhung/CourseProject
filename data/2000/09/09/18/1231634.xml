        <p>As a Japanese Buddhist, Yuko Ichioka knows she has developed an odd passion. But she says she can't help herself; she loves to sing black gospel music.</p>
        <p>Every Saturday, shortly after noon, she makes her way to Memorial Baptist Church in Harlem to rock to the rhythms of old Negro spirituals and sing praise to Jesus. Inside the church's sanctuary, she and a dozen others move into position, carefully huddling around a black baby grand piano, sopranos on the right, tenors on the left and altos in the middle.</p>
        <p>Up in the pulpit, Terrance Kennedy, a robust, big-voiced black man, takes his seat in front of the piano. Ms. Ichioka's eyes lock on him, waiting for the cue. His fingers race across the keys once. Then again. Finally, he nods his head. The other singers, who are also Japanese, quickly look at Ms. Ichioka, the only one in the group who speaks fluent English. She closes her eyes, starts to clap her hands and, in rapid Japanese, tells them to follow her, to hum, to sway, and to pretend, just for a little while, that they are not Japanese, but an ordinary group of gospel singers trying to feel God's spirit.</p>
        <p>In truth, they are all participants in a weekly three-hour workshop for Japanese people who envision themselves singing gospel like Mahalia Jackson, or at least like Whoopi Goldberg. It was Ms. Goldberg who, through her movie ''Sister Act,'' helped catapult gospel singing into one of the hottest new hobbies for Japanese here and in their homeland.</p>
        <p>Over the last two years, hundreds of Japanese, primarily women, have trekked to Memorial Baptist for the Saturday workshop where veteran black gospel music instructors like Mr. Kennedy lead them in a crash course of clapping, stomping, singing and swaying. Tommy Tomita, who is Japanese and a longtime Harlem resident, started the workshop in 1998 to give friends a look at one of the oldest forms of black music. When the friends demanded more, he persuaded the church to teach them how to sing. Now the workshop is advertised in Japanese stores and community centers in New York, as well as throughout Japan.</p>
        <p>The music has so moved Ms. Ichioka and a small group of repeat participants who live in New York that they have created their own Japanese community gospel choir. It started performing this summer at black gospel churches and ethnic arts festivals in New York. The director, Melody Moore, says it has left audiences across the city awe-struck. ''It's an amazing thing to watch,'' she said. ''People can see that they feel the spirit of this music. You hear their effort, and you have to believe it's God.''</p>
        <p>For many of these gospel converts, it is the music, the passionate piano playing, soul-stirring harmonies and the tendency of gospel audiences to scream and shout applause, that hooks them. ''They know how to sing,'' said Mr. Kennedy, the lead instructor for the Saturday workshop. ''Japanese are raised learning music, so it's not a case of teaching them to hold a note. For them, gospel is about learning how to sing freely.''</p>
        <p>In Japan, music teachers say they can hardly keep up with the growing number of teenagers, young professionals and some seniors who are rushing to classes, joining choirs and purchasing concert tickets for virtually any black gospel artist who visits the country. ''It's taken off like a rocket,'' said Ronald Rucker, who runs a gospel singing school in Tokyo and directs semiprofessional choirs throughout Japan, some of whom have recorded CD's.</p>
        <p>''I have 60-year-old Japanese grandmothers who want to sing the music of the African-American Christian worship experience. They're all smitten with the power of it. Sometimes they cry when they hear gospel being sung, even though they can't understand the English,'' Mr. Rucker said.</p>
        <p>That's what persuaded Mr. Kennedy to go to Osaka last year and help one of his former workshop students start the Harlem Japanese Gospel Choir-Osaka, a group of more than 30 devotees who, dressed in kimonos, tour Japan and the United States singing black gospel hymns. ''They're dying to express themselves,'' he said. In August, 15 members of that group sang during a tour of black churches in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the Bronx. ''In Japan, the audience is first very quiet,'' said Fumiko Tamura, 32, a singer with the Osaka choir. ''They don't know what to think. When we sing, they relax. Some people clap their hands. It makes you so happy to see the response.''</p>
        <p>The music is having an equally profound effect on some of the singers' lives, including Ms. Ichioka, a petite soprano who moved to New York four years ago to discover herself. Back in Japan, she had attempted to become a jazz singer but she said she gave up because she grew tired of hanging out in dark smoky nightclubs with drunken musicians. But her foray into gospel has persuaded her to give singing another try, this time marrying gospel with jazz rhythms. Ms. Ichioka, a 36-year-old former bilingual secretary, is now a student at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music.</p>
        <p>''I truly feel this is what I'm supposed to do in my life, to sing gospel music to help people have hope,'' said Ms. Ichioka, who argued that it is impossible to sing about Jesus without eventually becoming a believer. ''I haven't baptized myself but I think now deep down inside I am Christian, a child of God.''</p>
        <p>So on Sundays, she sits in the pews with Memorial Baptist's mostly black congregation, trying to enjoy the preaching as well as the singing. On Wednesdays, she devotes her lunch hour to singing gospel with a group of black musicians who perform at the church for European tourists. And she is almost always at the Saturday workshops, except three times a year, when she's visiting relatives in Osaka. But even then she stays close to the music, practicing with the choir there. ''When I sing the gospel songs, I feel the hope to go on in my life.''</p>
        <p>Shinya Fujimori is not ready to call himself a Christian but he said singing gospel is changing his life.  ''In Japan, I was not brought up with a religion,'' said Mr. Fujimori, 36, a computer consultant who has been attending the workshops for nearly two years and is one of the choir's founding members. ''So it's hard for me to become an instant church member. But in singing, I am learning to express my emotions about life. It's more natural for me, a Japanese man, to hug now. And I am starting to believe a little, the existence of something higher.''</p>
        <p>Critics at Memorial Baptist are also starting to believe.</p>
        <p>When the church first opened its doors to aspiring Japanese gospel singers, some members complained it was improper, that Japanese were merely looking to conquer an African-American art form without understanding its Christian message. ''There were people who felt that they just wanted to copy the music and run back to Japan with it,'' said James Ford, a church deacon who coordinates activities for tourists interested in gospel music. ''They really didn't believe they could be committed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford was also skeptical, though for different reasons. ''I didn't figure they could really capture the elements of gospel; singing, swaying and clapping at one time. That's hard for some black people.''</p>
        <p>Then earlier this year, a group of the singers performed for the congregation. ''There wasn't a dry eye in the church,'' he said. ''They sang with such commitment; we all rejoiced.''</p>
        <p>And rejoicing, workshop instructors say, may well be the most difficult concept to pass on to the Japanese. Midway through a Saturday workshop, Mr. Kennedy interrupted a rousing rendition of ''He Has Done Marvelous Things,'' a song they had been practicing for more than an hour. He jumped down from the pulpit piano and stood in the center of the singers.</p>
        <p>They looked puzzled, for they thought they had followed each of his commands to the letter: clapping in double time, blending their voices into multiple harmonies and sounding out the ''R'' in marvelous so that it sounds like an ''R'' and not an ''L.''</p>
        <p>He paced for a second, then asked, ''Gospel music is fun, right?''</p>
        <p>They nodded yes, though still puzzled. ''Well, it should look like fun. Smile. Let yourself feel the music. Ganbatte,'' he said, telling them in Japanese to go for it.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Kennedy started to run through the song once more, his singers stared at Ms. Ichioka, who all the while had been enraptured by the music, smiling with her hands clasped in prayer position and her head tilted to the sky.</p>
        <p>She caught their stares and deepened her smile. ''Feel the presence of God over you,'' she whispered. Slowly, four altos' stoic glances dissolved into mini smiles. The rest of the group started to get it, too. They all clapped louder and sang harder.</p>
        <p>No one but Mr. Kennedy seemed to notice that the music had stopped and the spirit had finally taken over.</p>
