        <p>When an ambitious young senator who would soon be president first saw ''The Best Man'' 40 years ago, he was quick to point out to its author that the play's vision of politicians wasn't exactly authentic. ''You know,'' John F. Kennedy is reported to have said to Gore Vidal, ''in a campaign we don't have all that much time to talk about the meaning of it all.''</p>
        <p>Well, no, probably not. And the senator might well have gone on to observe that no American statesman, at least since the country's earliest years, is likely to have spouted the kind of elegant epigrams that Mr. Vidal's characters (the ones he likes, anyway) come up with extemporaneously.</p>
        <p>Still, as current evidence makes narcotically clear, politicians can afford to be boring in ways that fictional characters cannot. And whatever the weaknesses of the unsteady revival that opened last night at the Virginia Theater under the amended title of ''Gore Vidal's 'The Best Man,' '' the production makes you wish that Mr. Vidal were writing the dialogue for the forthcoming, much-debated presidential debates.</p>
        <p>Despite the notoriously short shelf life of satire in the theater, this morality tale of a national political convention still rings appealingly with the whip cracks of abiding worldly wisdom dispensed in quips. You can sense from the audience's gratified laughter that some of the play's shapely lines are sure to be repeated at cocktail parties in this election season, prefaced with something like, ''Old Gore Vidal said it best, 40 years ago.'' The observations made here on the very different and often incompatible virtues of good statesmanship and good politics, and of public and private morals, have aged surprisingly well, more like fine Bordeaux than Beaujolais. References to sexual escapades in the White House and to the role of God in campaigning are guaranteed to evoke smiles of recognition.</p>
        <p>At its best the play brings to the backstabbing world of campaigning some of the artificial but bright verbal fire that two movies from the same period, ''All About Eve'' and ''The Sweet Smell of Success,'' brought to the backstabbing worlds of show business and journalism.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately what those movies -- and to a lesser degree the 1964 film version of ''The Best Man'' -- have that this production does not is a rousing, melodramatic vigor. Led by Charles Durning, Spalding Gray and Christopher Noth, under the direction of Ethan McSweeney, the starry ensemble often gives off a frustratingly tentative quality.</p>
        <p>The casting is sometimes wonderfully apt, especially in the surprising case of Mr. Gray, best known as a self-searching monologist, as a Brahminlike presidential candidate a la Adlai Stevenson. Yet the evening rarely finds the crackling, confrontational rhythms it needs. Tellingly, when Brooks Atkinson reviewed the original production in The New York Times, he admired the appropriateness of its being acted in ''the broad style of a political poster.''</p>
        <p>It is bizarre to fault any production with the scenery-chomping Elizabeth Ashley, who has a small but vivid role here, for lacking broadness. But this ''Best Man'' does not have the conviction to be big. Without that confident, breakneck swagger, what has dated in ''The Best Man'' becomes too apparent: its formal, debatelike structure; the essential flatness of most of its characters and a raw streak of elitism that is pure Vidal.</p>
        <p>For its first 10 minutes the production promises to turn into just the sort of hokey, bare-fisted word fight that you so long for it be. The arena is two suites (designed with a strange mix of naturalism and minimalism, with confusing invisible walls, by John Arnone) in a hotel in Philadelphia, where the convention is taking place.</p>
        <p>The front-runner is Mr. Gray's William Russell, a former governor and secretary of state with a quick wit, a patrician sensibility, high ideals and a penchant for womanizing to which his rock-solid wife (Michael Learned) has long been resigned. In the other corner is Russell's crude, pragmatic opposite, Senator Joseph Cantwell (Mr. Noth), a self-styled pillar of virtue with working-class roots who is not averse to dirty campaigning. (Think Richard Nixon airbrushed into handsomeness).</p>
        <p>Arbitrating between the two is the ex-president, Arthur Hockstader (Mr. Durning), an earthy Truman esque figure. The former president knows what it takes to run a country. He is also terminally ill. Mr. Vidal is obviously not above stacking the dramatic deck.</p>
        <p>With a life, a presidential nomination and a marriage all hanging in the balance, ''The Best Man'' should be awash in tension. The advance press for the production has emphasized the appealing quaintness of an age in which nominating conventions were packed with drama and suspense. And Mr. Vidal ups the ante by having each candidate discover a potentially annihilating secret about the other's past.</p>
        <p>Yet the anxiety onstage often seems to come more from the performers' uncertainty than from their characters' nail-biting ambition. This may be a consequence of a too-short rehearsal process and could, with time, partly right itself. Mr. Gray, Mr. Durning and Ms. Learned all have it in them to be first-rate in their roles. For the moment, however, only Mark Blum and Jordan Lage, as adversarial campaign managers, and Jonathan Hadary, as an uneasy figure from Cantwell's past, give off the heady nervousness that the audience is meant to feel vicariously.</p>
        <p>There is no doubt as to where Mr. Vidal's sympathies lie. And his rendering of the classic dictum that character is fate makes the political destinies here a bit too easy to chart in advance.</p>
        <p>Russell is a complex charmer, undone by his own ethics and his love of abstraction, and Mr. Gray delivers these traits with delightful, low-key eccentricity. Being an intellectual, given to quoting Bertrand Russell and Oliver Cromwell, he also gets the best lines. (On the politician's mandatory smile: ''All these predatory teeth, reminding us of our animal descent.'') In contrast Cantwell feels more like the product of a cynical cartoonist, all smooth surface and jagged self-interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noth, best known as Sarah Jessica Parker's high-living lover in ''Sex and the City,'' never gives Cantwell the all-consuming, compulsive drive that would make him horribly irresistible. The variations on Nixonian tics, like bringing his hand nervously to his throat, have the imposed feeling of a director's suggestions.</p>
        <p>As his shrill Southern wife, Christine Ebersole brings to mind a tin-plate version of the greedy sister-in-law from ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' She is more fun to look at than to listen to, since she has been styled in the image of Pat Nixon by Theoni V. Aldredge, who also did the costumes for the original ''Best Man.''</p>
        <p>In comparison Ms. Learned is refreshingly subdued, and with her air of fractured dignity she gives the evening some genuine tremors of emotion. So does Mr. Durning. Though he still had a shaky grasp of his lines on the night I saw him, he nonetheless had moments that broke through the gloss of the script to discover an affecting sense of mortality.</p>
        <p>And of vitality, too. At the end of the first act, Mr. Durning's Hockstader, who has gone wan with pain, suddenly springs back to life when he learns of a new, knotty kink in the competition between Russell and Cantwell.</p>
        <p>''Oh, I tell you Bill, I feel wonderful!'' he says to Russell. ''Up all night -- on the go all morning, seeing delegates -- I tell you there is nothing like a low-down political fight to put the roses in your cheeks.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Durning lustily renders the lines, they're a compelling argument for political adrenaline as a life force. For ''The Best Man'' to be the hearty entertainment it should and could be, this production needs to elevate its own pulse and to put the roses in its cheeks.</p>
