        <p>Matt Lindland prefers to look ahead at his competition in the Olympic Greco-Roman wrestling tournament and not behind at the summer-long story that determined his eligibility for the United States team.</p>
        <p>Lindland didn't learn that he and not Keith Sieracki, was definitely on the team until 10 days ago, even though the Olympic trials were in June. The series of protests and counterprotests concluded with a Supreme Court justice, John Paul Stevens, ruling that Lindland, would get the 76-kilogram (167.5 pounds) berth.</p>
        <p>''My prediction is to get a gold medal,'' Lindland, 30, said today. ''I'm going to go ahead and say that.''</p>
        <p>When he looks behind, he sees a mixture of annoyances, challenges and signs of encouragement. His frustrations include the United States Olympic Committee's support of Sieracki's eligibility and not his own.</p>
        <p>He hopes that his experience will help others who have similar troubles in the future. ''I hope that what I've been through will help other athletes when they've been wronged,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lindland lost to Sieracki, 2-1, on a referee's decision, but protested, contending that he had been tripped, then won an arbitration-ordered rematch, 8-0.</p>
