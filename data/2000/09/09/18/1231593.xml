        <p>For years, Lisa Lax had dreamed of the day she would produce the women's Olympic triathlon. That two-hour event made its Summer Games debut Saturday, and Lax's crew had 10 hours to turn a live race contested by 48 women and tracked by 45 cameras into a compelling prime-time tale cut into three major taped segments and narrated by Al Trautwig.</p>
        <p>''This is my favorite sport, at my favorite event, the Olympics, in my favorite venue, Sydney,'' Lax said in a golf cart at NBC's production compound overlooking the Sydney Opera House.</p>

        <p>For years, Lisa Lax had dreamed of the day she would produce the women's Olympic triathlon. That two-hour event made its Summer Games debut Saturday, and Lax's crew had 10 hours to turn a live race contested by 48 women and tracked by 45 cameras into a compelling prime-time tale cut into three major taped segments and narrated by Al Trautwig.</p>
        <p>''This is my favorite sport, at my favorite event, the Olympics, in my favorite venue, Sydney,'' Lax said in a golf cart at NBC's production compound overlooking the Sydney Opera House.</p>
        <p>Lax is the senior profile producer of NBC's Olympic unit and also runs the SWAT team, an 80-person group assigned to produce wide-ranging events like the women's and men's triathlons, the three-day equestrian, cross-country and road cycling as if they were live and recreate them into a new reality as stories with music, mini-profiles, commentary, interviews and beauty shots.</p>
        <p>This was a brutal schedule, 10 hours to recreate the triathlon; for the Ironman Triathlon, Lax gets several weeks. If it mattered less to NBC, they could take less time.</p>
        <p>Before the race began, Lax and Trautwig knew the story they wanted to tell: the star was the favorite, the Australian Michellie Jones. They had the best material on her, knew her career, knew how well she had done on the same course before. She was their center.</p>
        <p>Another Australian, Loretta Harrop, the Americans Shelia Taormina and Joanna Zeiger and the Canadian Carol Montgomery were all in Lax's sights. But Jones was irresistible.</p>
        <p>Inside the crowded production truck, Lax, Norm Samit (the director), Trautwig and Bob Chesterman (a tape editor) spoke and cajoled and shouted in an organized cacophony, a constant effort to find the best blimp and crane shots, close-ups and two-shots; to keep up with the leaders and to regularly show the relationship between the lead pack and the rest of the field.</p>
        <p>Trautwig stood just inside the open doorway, jotting notes. Once he poked his head outside and said, ''Hey's there's a race out there,'' as several women ran by.</p>
        <p>At one point, Montgomery crashed, and disappeared from NBC's view.</p>
        <p>''I hope it's not Carol,'' Lax said.</p>
        <p>''Stop rooting,'' Trautwig said.</p>
        <p>''It's Carol, that's Carol,'' Lax said. To Samit, she said, ''Milk it.''</p>
        <p>''Oh, that's nice,'' said Chesterman, ''just forget about the race.''</p>
        <p>With Montgomery a phantom, Lax kept her crew looking for Jones, who wasn't disappointing NBC. Taormina remained a character, even after her big lead after the swim had dissipated during cycling. She was fading. No, she wasn't. She was struggling, but hanging in.</p>
        <p>Playing the scamp, Trautwig said: ''Lisa, Dick Ebersol's on the line. We're going live.''</p>
        <p>She turned and gave a tiny smile.</p>
        <p>Ebersol is the chairman of NBC Sports.</p>
        <p>With a few minutes left in the event, Brigitte McMahon of Switzerland began to battle Jones for the lead.</p>
        <p>''This is going to be great,'' Trautwig said.</p>
        <p>''A sprint to the finish,'' Lax added.</p>
        <p>''Come on, pull this one out,'' said Trautwig, pulling for Jones.</p>
        <p>McMahon and Jones neared the Sydney Opera House, and Lax and Samit deployed a succession of cameras to follow them to the finish line, each one, it seemed, with Sydney as the perfect backdrop.</p>
        <p>McMahon won by two-hundredths of a second.</p>
        <p>Immediately, NBC planned the medal ceremony, hoping McMahon's 3-year-old son would find his way to the gold medal stand.</p>
        <p>''You think she'll bring the baby out?'' Lax asked.</p>
        <p>''If she cares about NBC, she will,'' said Trautwig.</p>
        <p>Soon, the boy, Dominique, was led to her mother. She picked him up and he kissed her twice, sweetly. ''Oh, nice!'' Lax exclaimed.</p>
        <p>Later, Lax said, ''It was 99.9 percent perfect, but Michellie didn't win.'' The final product will not have a McMahon profile; she'd been too unexpected.</p>
        <p>In the end, Lax's team took longer than expected, feeding the triathlon to NBC's enormous outpost at the International Broadcast Center at 4 a.m. Sunday, not 1 a.m.</p>
        <p>''We trust her,'' Ebersol said. ''We don't worry. You don't have to check Lisa's work.''</p>
        <p>And what Lax sent was enhanced reality: a race that became sports entertainment, with Trautwig's mostly eloquent narration; music added at crucial moments; plenty about Jones and her twin sister, but little about McMahon; underwater shots of the swimming segment; a close-up of Montgomery's shoes and more beauty shots of Sydney than in 17 days of Atlanta in 1996.</p>
        <p>And like virtually any event of length in NBC's Olympics, it was not shown all at once, but in segments that alternated with weight lifting, swimming and reports from Bob Costas.</p>
        <p>Over shots of Jones in the lead pack, Trautwig said: ''This is how she dreamed it would be. But would it be home field advantage or too much to bear?'' Even after he said it was possible for McMahon to make up the deficit, a quickie feature pulled NBC back to its favorite daughter.</p>
        <p>And he added, ''If you said to her this would be a sprint finish, she would take it.''</p>
        <p>But finally he relented, hinting that McMahon would win (to an audience that might already have known): ''Have a baby, go win the Olympic gold medal.''</p>
