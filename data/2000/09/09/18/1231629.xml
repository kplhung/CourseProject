        <p>He said he had come merely to listen, clap and say thank-you. But President Clinton was the headliner of the show, and he put his star power to work on Saturday night doing what many Democrats think he does best: rousing black voters to come out to the polls to help Democrats, particularly Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>In a speech before more than 4,000 people at the annual meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Mr. Clinton warned against complacency bred by prosperity, urging black leaders to work for Mr. Gore's election.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes it's harder to make a good decision in good times than in bad times,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''I know that people took a chance on me in 1992. But give me a break, the country was in a ditch, it wasn't that much of a chance.''</p>
        <p>The president remains extremely popular among black voters, and the Gore campaign is planning to use him at events where some of that popularity might rub off. Mr. Clinton embraced that role on Saturday night, recalling how black politicians had supported him during some of his darker days, asking them to do the same for Mr. Gore in November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton noted that he was not supposed to use the words ''vote for'' because the foundation, despite its obvious Democratic leanings, is a nonprofit, nonpartisan group. But he sidestepped the problem by asserting that the election of Mr. Gore and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for the Senate from New York, would help prevent the ''denial of justice'' to black people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore praised the president, saying, ''Millions of Americans will live better lives for a long time to come because of the job that has been done by President Bill Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore dodged the prohibition for explicitly asking members for their votes by calling on them to ''vote C.B.C.,'' or Congressional Black Caucus, if they wanted sympathetic Supreme Court nominees, affirmative action, black chairmen of House committees and a litany of other political goals.</p>
