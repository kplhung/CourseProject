        <p>The new season of the New York City Opera offers a veritable festival of productions by Mark Lamos, a theatrical director whose work for the operatic stage has yielded intermittent magic. By some reports that magic was scarce on opening night Tuesday, in Mr. Lamos's new staging of Donizetti's ''Roberto Devereux.'' But on Friday, the second evening, Mr. Lamos's still-fresh re-imagination of Puccini's overworked ''Madama Butterfly'' returned to the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>(Yet to come are Mr. Lamos's breezy new production of Handel's ''Acis and Galatea,'' unveiled by Glimmerglass Opera this summer, and revivals of his stagings of Britten's ''Turn of the Screw'' and Puccini's ''Tosca.'')</p>
        <p>The attractive ''Butterfly,'' first presented at Glimmerglass in 1997 and at the City Opera the next year, uses an abstract set -- a stage-wide flight of stairs and stage-high sliding screens designed by Michael Yeargan -- to suggest Cio-Cio-San's home, indoors and out. The look is clean, affording a blank canvas for the lighting design of Robert Wierzel, now subtle and slowly shifting, now garish and abrupt.</p>
        <p>The stage direction, which does not shirk from trading in the risky stock of stereotypical Japanese mannerisms, mostly without offense, is credited to David Grabarkewitz. But the Lamos touch is evident in the treatment of Sorrow, Cio-Cio-San's young son by the American naval officer Pinkerton, who married and quickly deserted her. (Perhaps Mr. Lamos's greatest operatic magic was his handling of Mozart's early opera ''Il Re Pastore'' at Glimmerglass, with a stage populated by children.)</p>
        <p>Typically a morose prop, Sorrow, gamely played by John Ramatowski, is in this conception irrepressible, his effervescent boyish outbursts making the impending tragedy all the more palpable and poignant. He is the very image of life, and when Pinkerton returns with his American wife to claim the boy, Cio-Cio-San's suicide seems not at all arbitrary but inevitable.</p>
        <p>For the most part the City Opera cast did justice to the production. Andrew Richards, as Pinkerton, produced a burnished tone with a fine ring in extroverted moments. But he occasionally fell into inaudibility with a slight drop in volume, turn of the head or movement toward the back of the stage, which remains problematic acoustically in the face of whatever electronic enhancement is now being applied.</p>
        <p>Jake Gardner proved a worthy foil as the American consul Sharpless, strong and steady of voice. Katherine Goeldner, as Cio-Cio-San's maid, Suzuki, sang richly. And Joel Sorensen delivered the part of the sleazy marriage broker, Goro, with stentorian tone, the one singer consistently able to overcome the acoustical dead spots.</p>
        <p>But the central character is Cio-Cio-San, and Susan Bullock, an English soprano in her City Opera debut, was an unimposing stage presence and slow to warm to the role. Her top notes early on, through whatever combination of vocal pressure and electronic tinkering, sounded shrill when loud and raw when quiet, but she fared better in her middle range at middle volume and carried solidly through her final scene.</p>
        <p>Jorge Mester conducted briskly and energetically, perhaps setting the singers on edge, for several anticipated his beat at times. The energy carried into the orchestra, which played better than it has in recent years but often drowned out singers aided little if at all by electronics.</p>
        <p>Those balances may sort themselves out, and Ms. Bullock may tame her high notes in later outings (next, on Saturday) to bring the level of performance closer to that of the staging.</p>
