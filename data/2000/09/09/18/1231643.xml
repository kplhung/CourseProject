        <p>While senators fumed about movie moguls who failed to show up for hearings in Washington last week, and shell-shocked studio executives kept their heads low and their lips locked in advance of a second round of hearings next week, many of those who work in the Hollywood trenches, actually making the movies, were beginning to chafe at the politicians' barrage.</p>
        <p>And they were not as reluctant as the corporate executives to talk about it.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a bunch of weasels scrambling for votes,'' said Larry Kasanoff, president of Threshold Entertainment, a company that makes, among other things, movies based on action-oriented video games like Mortal Kombat and Duke Nukem.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Kasanoff, like many of those interviewed late last week, said he felt Washington had unjustly singled out the movie industry, transforming a Federal Trade Commission report about marketing R-rated films to children into a headline-grabbing political pile-on.</p>
        <p>''In all honesty, I think what they're doing is reprehensible,'' he said. ''What they should be doing is focusing on why there is less of a family structure in America today. Instead, they attack us. These guys attack the easy issue because the hard issue doesn't make for such big headlines for them.''</p>
        <p>Even those in Hollywood who said they were genuinely troubled by some of the findings in the federal report also said they were concerned about the threat of censorship lurking beneath the talk. And more than a few expressed resentment that so many Democrats, particularly Vice President Al Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, were helping to lead the charge.</p>
        <p>''When you have Al Gore saying that Hollywood has six months to get its act together, that sounds like McCarthyism to me and I find it very troubling,'' said the screenwriter and director Rod Lurie. ''I worked for Gore in '88 and I am really taken aback by this. It's one thing to co-opt the enemy's issues, but not in a way that betrays your most important, fundamental values.''</p>
        <p>While few said they thought Hollywood liberals would now be driven to vote Republican, some said they might be a little less generous the next time Democrats come around with outstretched palms.</p>
        <p>''I was infuriated, with the Democrats doing that,'' said the filmmaker John Waters. ''But I'm still going to vote for them. Who else is there?''</p>
        <p>In fact, there is little evidence that Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman are suffering. The day after Mr. Lieberman testified at the Senate hearing, he and Mr. Gore were the star attractions at a fund-raising concert at Radio City Music Hall in New York, organized by top entertainment executives, which raised $6.5 million. And on Monday, Mr. Gore will travel to Los Angeles for a fund-raiser given by Warner Brothers.</p>
        <p>Many in Hollywood are skeptical about the timing of the current brouhaha.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that it's surprising this is happening in an election year,'' said Gale Anne Hurd, a veteran producer and chairman of Valhalla Motion Pictures. ''Hollywood is an easy target. And since guns are apparently sacrosanct, it's very easy to say, no, teenage violence is caused by the media.''</p>
        <p>Some acknowledged that the federal report had indeed uncovered upsetting instances of Hollywood studios marketing R-rated films and violent video games to children and young teenagers. But they, too, said they were troubled by the Senate committee's tone.</p>
        <p>''I think two different things about it,'' said Budd Schulberg, the veteran screenwriter and author of the novel ''What Makes Sammy Run?,'' about a quintessential Hollywood wheeler-dealer. ''One is that there is always a real danger in the government trying to make artistic decisions, which could lead to censorship. At the same time, I understand why they might want to, because with some of the films I've seen recently, I wish there was more self-censorship going on in Hollywood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schulberg was not the only one who was torn.</p>
        <p>Rick Hess, president of Propaganda Films, said: ''At the moment, I'm a provider of content, which means that I'm not in the driver's seat in making those kinds of marketing decisions. But I also have kids of my own and, I have to tell you, I don't envy those who have to make those marketing decisions.''</p>
        <p>The outspokenness of those in the trenches was a stark contrast to the stony silence from the corporate suites, where film executives were still deciding last week who would represent their studios at the next round of hearings in Washington. Last week, not a single studio representative showed up. The executives contended either that they had previous commitments or that they had never received an official invitation.</p>
        <p>Officials at two studios, insisting on anonymity, also expressed irritation over what they saw as the way senators had inflated a well-intended federal report into a political circus. Nevertheless, they said they expected the next hearing, scheduled for a week from Wednesday, to be cordial, with all the major studios represented and their executives assuring senators that Hollywood is just as concerned as anyone about the well-being of the nation's children.</p>
        <p>The Federal Trade Commission's report, released last week, found instances in which advertisements for R-rated films were shown during television programs that had what the report called a significant percentage of viewers (more than 20 percent) under the age of 17. The report also found that despite last year's assurances, under-age teenagers were still easily able to sneak into R-rated films, mainly by buying a ticket to a PG-rated film at a multiplex and then simply walking into a different theater.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me that we have more pressing problems in this country than kids sneaking into R-rated movies,'' Mr. Waters said. ''I think this is all ludicrous. You tell a kid there's something they're not allowed to see and of course they want to see it. You show me a kid who's not sneaking into R-rated movies, and I'll show you a failure in the making. The future C.E.O.'s of America are all sneaking into R-rated movies.''</p>
        <p>A few people even said they found nothing particularly troubling about marketing R-rated films to teenagers, pointing out that the purpose of the R rating is not to keep teenagers out but to require that they be accompanied by an adult.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't say not to be admitted, it says not to be admitted without an adult,'' Mr. Kasanoff said. ''There's nothing wrong with marketing to those kids and getting them to ask their parents to take them. I mean, Disney World markets to kids all the time. How many 8-year-old kids do you see flying down to Orlando by themselves? They go and beg their parents to take them, which is what Disney wants them to do. What's wrong with us marketing to 15-year-olds and saying, go ask your parent if you can go see this movie?''</p>
        <p>Most of those interviewed, though, said they felt the whole ruckus was probably transitory.</p>
        <p>''It's pure political pandering that is going to disappear right after the election,'' Mr. Lurie said. ''Both parties need Hollywood money too much. And then it will resurface again in 2004. It's that simple.''</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ENTERTAINMENT ISSUE  Correction:  September 20, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Monday about people in the movie industry who were troubled by politicians' recent criticism of Hollywood misstated the sponsorship of a fund-raiser for Al Gore that day. Although the sponsors included Alan Horn, president and chief operating officer of Warner Brothers, the company itself was not a sponsor. The others were Rob Reiner, the writer and director; Haim Saban, a children's television executive; and Ron Burkle, a supermarket entrepreneur.</p>
