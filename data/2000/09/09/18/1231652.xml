        <p>PERCHED on the top shelf of his locker, the football had a strip of white tape with ''Kevin Williams #23'' across it. And now, after the Jets' free safety had changed into a yellow T-shirt and black warm-up pants after the 27-14 victory over the Buffalo Bills, he tossed that football to Mike Kensil, the Jets' director of operations.</p>
        <p>''Is this the touchdown ball or the game ball?'' Kensil asked.</p>
        <p>''That's the touchdown ball,'' Williams said. ''I've got the game ball here in my bag.''</p>
        <p>''Give me that one, too,'' Kensil said.</p>
        <p>Williams dug the other football out of his black carry-all and tossed it to Kensil, who would have each football painted for posterity. One for the touchdown on a 97-yard kickoff return that sparked the Jets' comeback after the Bills had snatched a 7-0 lead; the other with the date, the opponent and the score that goes on a game ball.</p>
        <p>When Williams talked later about his 97-yard touchdown, he would say, ''That's a long ways to go.''</p>
        <p>He meant the yardage, but he had come a much longer distance. Nearly a year ago he couldn't walk 97 feet, much less run 97 yards. He was on a respirator with a life-threatening bacterial infection that had settled in his throat and lungs.</p>
        <p>At first he and the Jets were wondering if he would live, much less if he would ever play football again.</p>
        <p>''God was real good to me,'' Williams was saying now at the podium in the Jets' interview area. ''He brought me back a real long ways. He told me he'd never bring me back this far to leave me. I'm glad it happened just the way it did. If I went through that just to help somebody else, then I'm glad I did.''</p>
        <p>Williams apparently contracted a bacterial infection during the Jets' trip to Denver for their fourth game last season. After he returned with the team, he was hospitalized for several weeks.</p>
        <p>During his stay at Lenox Hill Hospital he required procedures to heal an abscess in his throat, to clean fluid from his neck and to clean bacteria from his chest. When he returned to the Jets' complex in November, the 6-footer from Pine Bluff, Ark., and Oklahoma State was drawn and weak, 34 pounds below his usual 190.</p>
        <p>He remained under his doctors' care until February, when he slowly resumed workouts.</p>
        <p>''But we were told,'' Coach Al Groh said, ''that there was no functional reason why Kevin couldn't play football again, that there was no muscle or structural damage. To go to the brink of death and to come back with his will to live and his will to come back as a football player, he established the heart of this team.''</p>
        <p>But when the 25-year-old Williams, now in his third season, was asked what he remembered about that brink of death, he declined to answer.</p>
        <p>''I don't like to reflect on that,'' he said. ''I've got my family -- my mother, father, six sisters, two brothers and my son Taje, with the accent over the 'e.' Let's talk about what's happening now.''</p>
        <p>Better yet, what happened when he took the Bills' kickoff on the 3-yard line and streaked up the sideline, using the rookie linebacker John Abraham as his bodyguard for the last 30 yards. ''I remembered running a kickoff back against the Washington Redskins last year, somebody came up behind me and knocked the ball out,'' he said. ''I didn't want that to happen this time.''</p>
        <p>When he danced through the end zone and over to the Jets' bench, his teammates danced with him. Not so much for what the touchdown meant to them as for what they knew the touchdown meant to him.</p>
        <p>But when asked about his touchdown, Williams talked only about how he hoped his teammates ''would get hyped by it.''</p>
        <p>They did, scoring again on Curtis Martin's 5-yard run, then on the final play of the first half when cornerback Marcus Coleman, inserted as a wide receiver, sprinted into the end zone and outleaped three Buffalo defenders for the touchdown that created a sudden 21-l4 lead and deflated the Bills as much as it juiced the Jets.</p>
        <p>Now the Jets, 3-0 for the first time since 1966, await their reintroduction next Sunday in Tampa to Keyshawn Johnson, whose contract demands resulted in a trade to the Bucs, also 3-0, this season. Williams acknowledged being ''real close'' to Johnson as he basked in the glory of his 97-yard touchdown return.</p>
        <p>''I knew God didn't bring me back for nothing,'' Williams said. ''I knew there'd be something like this.''</p>
        <p>Even he didn't think that that something would be two footballs -- one a game ball, the other for a touchdown. Every so often a defensive back gets a game ball and every so often a defensive back scores a touchdown. But seldom does it happen to the same defensive back in the same game.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, two footballs,'' Kevin Williams agreed. ''I never got two footballs before.''</p>
