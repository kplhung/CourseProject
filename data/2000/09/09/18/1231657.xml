        <p>The Mets left for Atlanta tonight having proved nothing much in four games with the Montreal Expos. Twice, they punished the Expos by scoring 10 runs. Twice, they were mastered by a tough, young starter.</p>
        <p>The rookie Tony Armas Jr. and two relievers limited the Mets to four singles today in the Expos' 5-0 victory. The Mets believe they are over their slump of early September, when their offense suddenly escaped them. But splitting the series in Montreal was disappointing, and the Mets have a broad philosophy as they prepare for three games with the Braves.</p>
        <p>''We just want to get back to playing a really solid series from the first pitch of the series until the last out,'' said catcher Mike Piazza, who was hit in the shoulder by an Armas fastball and was 1 for 2 with a walk. ''For whatever reason, we've played well up until this month and been a little inconsistent.''</p>
        <p>After overwhelming Dustin Hermanson on Saturday -- one night after being humbled by Javier Vazquez -- the Mets could do nothing with Armas, a former Yankee prospect. They got only one runner past second as Armas, a right-hander, kept them off balance with sliders in fastball counts. Vladimir Guerrero homered twice off curveballs from Bobby J. Jones (9-6), and a two-run homer by Orlando Cabrera gave the Expos the rest of their runs.</p>
        <p>The Mets had kept Guerrero from hurting them in the first three games of this series. He had two hits in 11 at bats as the Mets threw off-speed pitches low and away or busted him inside. But pitching to Guerrero is often hopeless because of his exceptional plate coverage. He may be the most talented all-round player in baseball.</p>
        <p>''It's not enough to make two good pitches,'' said Jones, who compared Guerrero's opposite-field strength to Piazza's. ''You have to make three.''</p>
        <p>As the best player on his team, Guerrero is the Expos' equivalent of Piazza. Jones knew Rick White had hit Guerrero in the ribs on Saturday, and he was not surprised to see Armas drill Piazza on the sleeve on a 3-1 pitch with two outs in the fourth. Jones hit Fernando Seguignol in the bottom of that inning, and both benches were warned. But there were no further incidents.</p>
        <p>Piazza implied that he believed he was hit deliberately, but he did not make much of it.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather get hit there than in the head or any higher than that,'' said Piazza, who later added, ''It's only two feet, a foot and a half, but it's still a big difference.''</p>
        <p>Piazza, of course, was beaned by Roger Clemens in July, the month in which the Mets began their streak of 25 victories in 34 games. That stretch gave them a comfortable lead for a playoff spot, which they have maintained despite going 6-10 this month. After Arizona's 7-1 loss to Atlanta today, the Mets maintained a five-game lead over the Diamondbacks in the National League wild-card race and trailed the Braves by three games in the East.</p>
        <p>Some Mets tried to understate the importance of their series with the Braves, saying the immediate goal was to qualify for the playoffs. ''That's when it'll be time to do it,'' said third baseman Robin Ventura. ''You want to win the games, but it's not the end of the world right now.''</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine's stock answer is that the games are on the schedule, so the Mets must play them. But there is more at play than just that, and before the game, Valentine said little to conceal the series's meaning. ''They have been our strongest competition, a team we've been trying to catch for a long time,'' he said. ''So you figure out what it means.''</p>
        <p>The Mets have lost 16 of their last 18 regular-season and postseason games in Atlanta. When the Mets were there in July, losing two of three, Valentine disputed the idea that his team had to be flawless to beat them. He still feels that way.</p>
        <p>''We're closer to them in the standings,'' Valentine said. ''We've played them seven times already, and we know them. We play a similar brand, and we know we can beat them.</p>
        <p>''We also know that we don't have to be perfect. Watching them play all season, they've made some mistakes, played that very similar brand of baseball -- consistently good, yet less than perfect.</p>
        <p>''For us to be this close, it's not because we have gotten much better, it's because they have come down to meet us,'' he said. ''The rest of the league has played a little better against them this year than they have in the past. Must mean something. If it means the rest of the league is better, it means we are better.''</p>
        <p>The Mets may believe that, but they are aware of the skepticism of their fans, outfielder Darryl Hamilton said. If the Mets lose Monday night, they will hear about the psychological edge the Braves have on them, about how the late-season losing is happening all over again.</p>
        <p>''We know that, but by no means are we thinking that,'' Hamilton said. ''Our whole season doesn't depend on tomorrow night. But it's an important game for us, no doubt about that.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Right fielder DEREK BELL, who has swelling in his bruised left knee, sat out his second game in a row Sunday.  . . . The right-hander RICK REED, who has a 2.37 earned run average in five career games at Turner Field, will miss starting there by one day. The Mets are starting the left-handers MIKE HAMPTON, GLENDON RUSCH and AL LEITER, in that order. GREG MADDUX, ANDY ASHBY and TOM GLAVINE will start for Atlanta. . . . A note of caution for the Mets: six Braves -- BRIAN JORDAN, CHIPPER JONES, BOBBY BONILLA, WALT WEISS, ANDRUW JONES and ANDRES GALARRAGA -- were batting .337 or better against left-handers entering Sunday's game.</p>
