        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio's Senate campaign has begun broadcasting this 30-second ad.</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''Plan''</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- This spot focuses on Mr. Lazio's tax plan, which he has promoted as a major distinction between him and Hillary Rodham Clinton, but which he has also tried to present as less drastic than George W. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut. The ad opens with Mr. Lazio picking up one of his daughters on the beach, the lead-in to a rather run-of-the-mill montage of Mr. Lazio speaking, talking to voters, marching in a parade and shaking an elderly woman's hand. In contrast to other recent Lazio ads, Mrs. Clinton is neither pictured nor mentioned by name.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Rick Lazio: He's one of us. Unlike his opponent, Lazio offers a plan for job creation, not just a promise. Tax cuts on investment to create jobs. Tax credits to help families pay for college. No more marriage penalty. And the Lazio plan ends double taxation by letting you deduct your payroll taxes off your tax return. Lazio still reserves more than 75 percent of the surplus to protect Social Security and Medicare. Rick Lazio: Trust him to fight for you.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mrs. Clinton's tax plan includes tax cuts that would encourage small businesses to create jobs, and her economic plan for upstate New York is also intended to create jobs by attracting high-tech industries. Mr. Lazio's tax plan has been criticized by several independent experts, who say that his projections differ significantly from Congressional estimates and that the plan's real cost may be more than $1 trillion.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The ad banks on the long-held Republican belief that broad tax cuts appeal to voters. The ''one of us'' line is a dig at Mrs. Clinton's status as a newcomer to New York. Although earlier ads have cautioned, ''Clinton? You just can't trust her,'' this one sounds the same theme on a more positive note.</p>
