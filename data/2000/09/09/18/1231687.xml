        <p>If this is Pro Player Stadium in September, then the Miami Dolphins must be winners.</p>
        <p>With a 19-6 victory tonight over the Baltimore Ravens before a rain-soaked crowd of 73,464, the Dolphins now have won 11 straight home games in September. They also beat Indianapolis at home on Aug. 31 to start the 1997 season.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins haven't lost at home in September since 1993, when the Jets prevailed, 24-14.</p>
        <p>''With all the rain and sloppiness, this was not a speed game, it was a big slug game,'' said Dolphins linebacker Jason Taylor, who had two and a half of his team's six sacks. ''We kept slugging right with them.''</p>
        <p>The Dolphins moved to 2-1 while Baltimore, which won a stirring 39-36 duel against Jacksonville last week, dropped to 2-1.</p>
        <p>At halftime, Dan Marino, who set most of the National Football League's passing records, had his number retired. A life-size bronze statue of Marino that will stand in front of the stadium was dedicated. The ceremony came complete with a fireworks display, which left a haze over the field for about 15 minutes. By the time the third quarter began, the heavy rain had stopped, but some of the haze remained.</p>
        <p>Miami kept frustrating the Ravens, who had to settle for two field goals. Baltimore's last drive was symbolic of its offensive futility; the Ravens ran out of downs at Miami's 13-yard line.</p>
        <p>The rain -- some of the residue from a fizzling Hurricane Gordon -- turned the field into something resembling a swamp. Before the game, a tarpaulin covered the western half of the field, where the baseball infield is, but the eastern half took a pelting. When the tarp came off, the clay infield became mushy and slippery.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins did not moan about the weather; they almost celebrated. The conditions were right in line with their conservative approach. ''Our foundation is set to run the football and throw off that and to play defense,'' Coach Dave Wannstedt said. ''We didn't have to change anything.''</p>
        <p>Still, the teams tread very carefully through the first half as a steady rain continued to fall.</p>
        <p>The Ravens' Tony Banks began with a screen pass for 16 yards to Jamal Lewis, but he had two passes dropped on the series before it ended on a mistake of his own. Fading back to pass, Banks  lost control of the ball and took a 13-yard loss.</p>
        <p>Miami played more conservatively when it assumed control at its 29. The first six plays were runs, including a 5-yarder by Thurman Thomas, the former Buffalo Bill, on a third-and-3 at Baltimore's 48. Lamar Smith then contributed a 12-yard run and quarterback Jay Fiedler found wide receiver Leslie Shepherd for 7 yards. Shepherd dropped a potential first-down pass before Olindo Mare opened the scoring 10 minutes into the game on a 42-yard field goal.</p>
        <p>Baltimore's next series went nowhere. Priest Holmes's first-down run was stopped for no gain, then Banks fumbled as he was sacked by end Trace Armstrong. A third-down pass fell 6 yards short as the crowd roared.</p>
        <p>Jeff Ogden twisted 31 yards on a punt return that gave the Dolphins possession at their 48. That helped set up another field goal by Mare, from 41 yards, with 12 minutes 37 seconds left in the half.</p>
        <p>The Ravens failed to capitalize on an interception by end Rob Burnett at the Miami 27 with four and a half minutes left in the half. Fiedler's pass bounced off Thomas's hands and into the arms of cornerback James Trapp. Thomas dislodged the ball, but Burnett caught the deflection.</p>
        <p>On second down, Banks aimed for Patrick Johnson at the Miami 6. The pass was intercepted by cornerback Patrick Surtain and returned 43 yards. Even so, the Ravens were soon back in business.</p>
        <p>Lewis's 45-yard run put Baltimore at the Miami 35, but with time running down, the closest it could get was 12 yards from a touchdown.</p>
        <p>On fourth down, as the half ended, Matt Stover, standing on the slippery clay, sent a 30-yard field goal attempt into the Dolphins' defensive line.</p>
        <p>Struggling for crumbs in the first half, the Dolphins came alive offensively in the third quarter. On their first possession of the third quarter, they went 61 yards in five plays for a touchdown. Fiedler contributed a 28-yard pass to Smith, the running back, and on the next play Smith ran right, then came back left for the 7-yard score.</p>
        <p>''They probably didn't see us, there was so much smoke on the field,'' Wannstedt said.</p>
