        <p>Highlights and lowlights from the weekend.</p>
        <p>THE HEISMAN HIGHLIGHT REEL</p>
        <p>Extended for another week  LaDainian Tomlinson rushed for 243 yards on 39 carries and had two touchdowns as Texas Christian, now No. 18, defeated Northwestern, 41-14.</p>
        <p>Michael Vick scored on a dazzling flip into the end zone, threw for a touchdown and set up a third with a 45-yard run as Virginia Tech, now No. 5, beat Rutgers, 49-0. He outgained Rutgers in the first half, 209-131.</p>
        <p>Shelved for lack of action  Drew Brees was 13 of 22 passing for 221 yards with an interception that was returned for a touchdown in No. 21 Purdue's 23-21 loss to No. 16 Notre Dame.</p>
        <p>Understudy of the Week  Stanford's freshman quarterback, Chris Lewis, replaced the injured Randy Fasani seven minutes into the game against Texas, now No. 15, and led the Cardinal to a 27-24 victory, the biggest upset of the weekend. He was 12 of 33 passing for 214 yards and 3 touchdowns, the biggest coming with 1 minute 12 seconds left in the game and Stanford trailing, 24-20. Lewis zipped a sideline pass to DeRonnie Pitts, who broke a tackle and somersaulted over Roderick Babers into the end zone.</p>
        <p>Very Good Teams to Watch From the Hinterlands  Southern Mississippi (1-1) raced to a 21-0 lead minutes into the game, forced four turnovers and handed Alabama its first shutout since 1997.</p>
        <p>Boise State (2-1) fought back from a 31-14 deficit in the third quarter against Arkansas to tie the game in the fourth quarter. The Razorbacks scored with 6:12 to play to regain the lead at 38-31, then stopped the Broncos' bid to force overtime at their 1-yard line with about a minute to play.</p>
        <p>History Sprouts From Ivy  Yale became the first school to win 800 games as Rashad Bartholomew scored three touchdowns and rushed for 201 yards in a 42-6 victory over Dayton. Yale played its first game on Nov. 16, 1872, beating Columbia, 3-0. The Bulldogs are 800-298-51 in 128 seasons.</p>
        <p>Who Loves You, Baby?  ''One of two things is going to happen. Either we are going to separate and fall or we're going to come together. I simply have to do a better job. I love this group of guys. They deserve better than what they're getting for me.'' -- Alabama Coach Mike DuBose after losing to Southern Mississippi, 21-0, and falling to 1-2 (and out of the polls?).</p>
