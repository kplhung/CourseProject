        <p>After 105 years as an afternoon newspaper, the local daily paper, The Hour, will shift to morning publication on Monday.</p>
        <p>By doing so, The Hour, which circulates in Norwalk, Westport, Wilton and Weston, will be following a national trend of afternoon newspapers' switching to late-night publication and morning delivery in the last two decades. The switch will leave Connecticut with only two afternoon papers, The Manchester Journal-Inquirer and The Willimantic Chronicle. For many years, the vast majority of the state's newspapers were published and delivered in the afternoon.</p>

        <p>After 105 years as an afternoon newspaper, the local daily paper, The Hour, will shift to morning publication on Monday.</p>
        <p>By doing so, The Hour, which circulates in Norwalk, Westport, Wilton and Weston, will be following a national trend of afternoon newspapers' switching to late-night publication and morning delivery in the last two decades. The switch will leave Connecticut with only two afternoon papers, The Manchester Journal-Inquirer and The Willimantic Chronicle. For many years, the vast majority of the state's newspapers were published and delivered in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>Chet Valiante, the publisher of The Hour, said that ''as our press time had become earlier and earlier -- it's now 10:30 a.m. -- we were breaking only about three percent more stories than the morning papers had published.''</p>
        <p>By converting to morning publication, The Hour will be in direct competition with The Connecticut Post, which is published in Bridgeport and circulates throughout Fairfield County, and The Advocate in Stamford, which began publishing a Norwalk edition in January of last year.</p>
        <p>''Our circulation definitely will increase,'' Mr. Valiante said of The Hour, which is owned by a trust created by a former owner, Nellie Thomas.</p>
        <p>As of March 31, the Hour's weekday circulation was 16,225, compared with 21,459 a decade ago, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation. A Sunday edition, started last September, has a circulation of 15,346.</p>
