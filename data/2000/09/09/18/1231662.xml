        <p>He has the highest winning percentage of any active football coach in Division I. He has a 28-12 record against ranked teams and has won a national title. Phillip Fulmer, in his ninth season as Tennessee coach, has lost only 15 games. But there he was once again shuffling to midfield, a heartbreaking 27-23 loss only seconds old, to shake the hand of the man whose team beat him -- Florida Coach Steve Spurrier.</p>
        <p>For those counting, which means anyone who knows the words to ''Rocky Top,'' that's seven times in nine meetings that the sharp-tongued, visor-tossing Spurrier, a Tennessee native himself, has met Fulmer at midfield as the victor. It doesn't matter that Spurrier is not too far behind his rival in the stratosphere of winning percentages or that he, too, coached his Florida team to a national title, in 1996 -- at least not to the lost souls who light up the switchboards of talk radio stations.</p>

        <p>He has the highest winning percentage of any active football coach in Division I. He has a 28-12 record against ranked teams and has won a national title. Phillip Fulmer, in his ninth season as Tennessee coach, has lost only 15 games. But there he was once again shuffling to midfield, a heartbreaking 27-23 loss only seconds old, to shake the hand of the man whose team beat him -- Florida Coach Steve Spurrier.</p>
        <p>For those counting, which means anyone who knows the words to ''Rocky Top,'' that's seven times in nine meetings that the sharp-tongued, visor-tossing Spurrier, a Tennessee native himself, has met Fulmer at midfield as the victor. It doesn't matter that Spurrier is not too far behind his rival in the stratosphere of winning percentages or that he, too, coached his Florida team to a national title, in 1996 -- at least not to the lost souls who light up the switchboards of talk radio stations.</p>
        <p>No, the calls poured in and the complaints mounted -- the coach was too satisfied with field goals, he wouldn't open up the offense, old Spurrier is just, dangit, a better coach, and yes, let's get rid of him.</p>
        <p>In fact, about the only one in the state of Tennessee on Saturday who had kind words for Fulmer was Spurrier.</p>
        <p>The Florida coach knew the Volunteers had outplayed his Gators and told Fulmer so as well as anyone else who put a microphone in front of him. Yes, their teams, their states are bitter rivals, but Fulmer and Spurrier share a passion for a game; they compete, but they also honor a professional code of collegial conduct.</p>
        <p>''I appreciated Coach Spurrier's comments at midfield,'' Fulmer said. ''Everybody wants to make a big deal about it -- our rivalry -- and we do have a competitive rivalry, but he's a class guy and always has been.''</p>
        <p>It's remarkable how strident, how vitriolic, how, well, uninformed fans become after a loss. The names and accents vary from region to region, but the sentiments remain the same.</p>
        <p>Last week, all of Indiana was in an uproar that Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie ran out the clock with 1 minute left in regulation on his 30-yard line and the score tied against Nebraska, the No. 1-ranked team in the nation. Here's a coach who knows the vultures are circling, but still offered a not only reasonable, but correct explanation. In Arnaz Battle, he had a quarterback making his second career start, had completed only three passes leading an offense that hadn't spurted 40 yards for much of the game. He decided to play for the victory in overtime.</p>
        <p>Still, the Irish faithful howled the next day even after it was discovered Battle had suffered a broken wrist on the game's first play. Wonder how the northern Indiana airwaves crackled over the weekend when Notre Dame, now ranked No. 16, upset Purdue, 23-21, with a converted tight end playing quarterback?</p>
        <p>All coaches accept that criticism from know-nothings on talk radio comes with the job, as does pressure from alumni and rumor-mongering on the Internet and in newspapers. But once in a while, one of them speaks out about the illogic of it all.</p>
        <p>After U.C.L.A. upset then-No. 3 Alabama in the season opener -- a startling postscript to the Bruins' 4-7 1999 season, Coach Bob Toledo blurted: ''We were a young inexperienced team last year, and all of sudden they thought we couldn't coach anymore.'' Well, after beating No. 3 Michigan on Saturday, the 3-0 Bruins are now No. 6, and someone coached them to that ranking.</p>
        <p>This year Fulmer has an inexperienced team. A redshirt freshman made his first career start at quarterback, and he had four new lineman in front of him. Two field goals were the result of fumbles near the goal line -- one by the rookie quarterback, the other by a senior running back -- and a third goal-line kick came when time ran out in the first half.</p>
        <p>Spurrier understood. The callers didn't.</p>
        <p>But then again this week, many callers across the nation couldn't understand why another coach, a basketball one in Indiana, was fired by his university. He didn't do anything as egregious as lose a game; he was just insubordinate, physically and verbally abusive and disrespectful to anyone he chose to be.</p>
        <p>No one wants to squelch opinion. It's the marrow of the nation's obsession with sports. But edicts are best left to those who know what they're talking about.</p>
        <p>How would you like someone who doesn't know a scalpel from a steak knife, a typewriter from a radio dial, a carburetor from a Cuisinart, to call for your job? No matter how much anyone believes they know about coaching football, unless they have the experience and knowledge of how a 19-year-old player will respond in his career debut before more than 108,000 people, they don't know anything.</p>
        <p>Fulmer made it clear he didn't like losing to Florida. But he put it in its proper perspective. ''Our pride is hurt,'' he said, ''but the sun will come up and we will fight again.''</p>
