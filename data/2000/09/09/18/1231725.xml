        <p>PERDONCIN-Peter. It is with great sorrow and loss that his friends and colleagues at Montefiore note the passing of Peter Perdoncin, who headed the Medical Center's construction team for over three decades. An outstanding leader, exemplary engineer, supportive colleague and great friend, Pete inspired all who had the good fortune to work with him. Forcefully but quietly, he guided the design and construction of all the modern facilities at Montefiore, from the smallest to the new Children's Hospital, now under construction. His tireless efforts to ensure the finest facilities for our patients set a standard by which all of us will continue to be measured. Above all, Pete will be remembered for his integrity, good humor and friendship. We will miss him, no one who worked alongside him will forget him. Our heartfelt condolences are extended to his loving wife Irene, son Mark and daughter Lisa. Maurice E. LaBonne Vice President for Real Estate &amp; Facility Development Charles Balancia Vice President for Facility Services Montefiore Medical Center</p>
