        <p>The marketers that did not buy commercial time on Dr. Laura Schlessinger's new syndicated daytime television show may want to thank the gay and lesbian activists who pressured them to bypass the show. The series so far seems to be as big a miss with viewers as it has been with advertisers.</p>
        <p>Throughout the summer, activists urged marketers not to support ''Dr. Laura,'' which went on the air last Monday on more than 200 stations across the country, because of what they deemed hurtful and harmful remarks about homosexuals by Dr. Schlessinger on her radio show. As a result, virtually all the big packaged-goods and retail advertisers that typically buy spots on daytime talk shows did not become sponsors.</p>
        <p>That left the commercial time during the first shows filled primarily with far less familiar names, among them Zatarain's rice; companies that sell things like compact discs, diet aids or insurance policies through toll-free phone numbers; and other sibling programs of Paramount Domestic Television, which produces ''Dr. Laura.'' The division is a unit of Viacom.</p>
        <p>In addition, more than two dozen marketers whose commercials ran during shows last week said they would end their sponsorship after activists posted complaints about them on the Web site, www.stopdr laura.com. Among them were Geico, Unilever and Verizon.</p>
        <p>Now ratings are in for the first four ''Dr. Laura'' shows through Thursday, and media analysts characterized them as weak. Viewership fell 15 to 28 percent compared with the programs that run in time slots just before ''Dr. Laura,'' they said, and were off 12 to 28 percent compared with the shows running a year ago that ''Dr. Laura'' replaced.</p>
        <p>''It's a goner,'' said Marc Berman, media analyst for the Mediaweek .com unit of VNU USA, who produces The Programming Insider, a daily e-mail newsletter. He called the ratings ''lackluster'' and ''disappointing.''</p>
        <p>''Viewers are not seeking out the controversial doctor'' on television, Mr. Berman said. ''Sometimes it's better to be just heard and not seen.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, Joel Berman, co-president of Paramount Domestic Television, said the company believed the series ''will be a part of the long-term TV landscape.''</p>
        <p>''We are producing a responsible, substantive program,'' he added, ''and believe viewers will continue to tune in and advertisers will follow.''</p>
