        <p>Champion Ventures, the investment fund for professional athletes started by two ex-San Francisco 49ers, has finished its second round of financing in as many years, raising $150 million, company officials said.

        <p>Who said the only money to be made in sports was on the playing field?</p>
        <p>Champion Ventures, the investment fund for professional athletes started by two ex-San Francisco 49ers, has finished its second round of financing in as many years, raising $150 million, company officials said. That is a considerable sum given that last year Ronnie Lott, the football hall-of-famer who along with Harris Barton founded Champion, raised $40 million from football stars including Keyshawn Johnson and hockey players like Wayne Gretzky.</p>
        <p>''I think people started to understand what we are bringing to the table,'' Mr. Lott said last week.</p>
        <p>Champion is often referred to as a ''fund-of-funds'' because it invests money in the funds of some of the most prestigious venture capitalists, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and Accel Partners.</p>
        <p>Messrs. Lott and Barton decided to start Champion last year for two reasons. First, they wanted to give athletes access to some of the best venture capital investors in technology, which usually invest money for pension funds and corporations, not individuals. Second, the two hope athletes at Champion events can meet corporate executives who would be willing to employ them after they retire from professional sports.</p>
        <p>Celebrity athletes have often been criticized for being bad investors, spending more time scouring play books than their own financial statements, leaving agents to manage their futures for them. So for Mr. Lott, educating fellow athletes is something of a passion. ''I don't mind staking my reputation on someone who is walking away from the game,'' he said. ''Great employees always try to affect other people. I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great to lift up my teammates?' The more people that foster that, the better off we will be.''</p>
        <p>New investors include the tennis player Andre Agassi, the Olympic medalist and sprinter Michael Johnson and the boxer Oscar De La Hoya. Mr. Lott said also that Joe Montana, the former 49er star quarterback and hall-of-famer, will also join Champion as a general partner.</p>
