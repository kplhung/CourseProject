        <p>Making his campaign premiere in the Rocky Mountain states, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said today that the Democrats now see Colorado, long dominated by Republicans, as a swing state, and they plan to contest it vigorously.</p>
        <p>Until recently, polls showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with a comfortable lead over Vice President Al Gore, but the most recent published survey, conducted last week, showed Mr. Gore closing to within three percentage points.</p>

        <p>Making his campaign premiere in the Rocky Mountain states, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said today that the Democrats now see Colorado, long dominated by Republicans, as a swing state, and they plan to contest it vigorously.</p>
        <p>Until recently, polls showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas with a comfortable lead over Vice President Al Gore, but the most recent published survey, conducted last week, showed Mr. Gore closing to within three percentage points.</p>
        <p>''I want to say about Colorado that we're closing, aren't we?'' Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, told 250 people at a pipe fitters' union hall, where people had gathered for an annual party that mixes politics, burritos and a Denver Broncos game on television.</p>
        <p>''We know it's a battle, but we're closing, and that's why I'm here,'' he said. ''I'm going to come back. And I want to tell you, the vice president, I bet, will be here and our wives will be here. Probably our children will be here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman is to campaign Monday in New Mexico, another Rocky Mountain swing state, which the vice president visited in late August. Campaign aides say he will speak there about a patient's bill of rights, one of the issues the Democrats will focus on this week. Mr. Lieberman plans to travel to Los Angeles later Monday, for a campaign event and a fund-raiser with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>At the union hall here, Mr. Lieberman spoke out for the first time in this campaign about urban and suburban sprawl, one of the most contentious issues in Western states.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the most beautiful places in America, and on earth,'' he said. ''And we're going to be an administration that does not stifle development, but will make sure it doesn't spread out so much that it changes a way of life, a Colorado way of life.''</p>
