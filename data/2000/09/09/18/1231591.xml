        <p>So what if it is only so-so as a TV show? On the Web, it just may have found a new life.</p>
        <p>Bigbrother2000.com, the official Web address of the CBS television show ''Big Brother,'' was hailed last week as the top newcomer site in July in Media Metrix's monthly ratings. The company said that 4.25 million unique visitors logged onto the site during the month, where they were able to vote on which housemate should be dismissed or catch up on any episodes they may have missed.</p>
        <p>And that is even without CBS claiming the more obvious domain name, www.bigbrother.com. That Web site, unrelated to the CBS show, offers visitors the opportunity to view a collection of Webcams. Not surprisingly, this site has also experienced a surge in visitors this summer as Internet users stumble upon it looking for the reality TV show's Web site.</p>
        <p>''Big Brother,'' which appears six nights a week, follows the daily lives of a houseful of strangers who have been sequestered together since July. Critics have labeled the show cheap voyeurism, a poor second cousin to the hit CBS reality series ''Survivor,'' which wrapped up its initial series last month.</p>
        <p>The current ''Big Brother'' series is scheduled to finish at the end of September, when the single remaining housemate wins $500,000.</p>
        <p>The American reaction to ''Big Brother'' has been far different from the response in Holland, Spain and Germany, where versions of the program have been runaway hits. And it appears to be vastly different on the Web, where ''cheap voyeurism'' may be striking a chord.</p>
        <p>Coming in second for Media Metrix's top newcomer site in July was Bigfatbaby.com, an electronic greeting card service that attracted two million visitors during the month. Gaspricewatch.com, which provides research on local gasoline prices, surged in popularity as well, with 1.364 million visitors in July.</p>
