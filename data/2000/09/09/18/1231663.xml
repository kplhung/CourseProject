        <p>OpSail 2000, the grand parade of tall ships, ended six weeks ago. But long after other ships have returned home, the ramshackle Ukrainian schooner Bat'kivshchyna remains in port here, awaiting a berth in dry dock for badly needed repairs and negotiating to spend the winter just up the Thames River in Norwich.</p>

At least five have flown back to Ukraine, one is in New Jersey painting houses and another is in Oregon.

        <p>OpSail 2000, the grand parade of tall ships, ended six weeks ago. But long after other ships have returned home, the ramshackle Ukrainian schooner Bat'kivshchyna remains in port here, awaiting a berth in dry dock for badly needed repairs and negotiating to spend the winter just up the Thames River in Norwich.</p>
        <p>The crew, which numbered 15 when the Bat'kivshchyna left Kiev in April, has mostly dispersed. At least five have flown back to Ukraine, one is in New Jersey painting houses and another is in Oregon. On board remain only the captain, Dmytro Biriukovich; his wife, Nina; and the cook, Leonid Deriagen. They subsist largely on donated provisions.</p>
        <p>The ship, however, is not quite stuck. Fame from OpSail has led to invitations to tall ship events next year in the Great Lakes and the following year in the Pacific. The Bat'kivshchyna (pronounced bat-keev-SHIN-a) has formed a partnership with Children of Chernobyl, a relief agency for victims of the nuclear accident. And corporate sponsorships are in the works.</p>
        <p>''I dreamed of being on the sea,'' said Captain Biriukovich (pronounced beer-yoo-KOH-vich), a retired civil engineer. ''I dreamed of promoting the country. I repeat Shakespeare: 'The best in life is love and voyages.' '' He added, ''Our aim next year is to continue together with the Chernobyl charitable fund to continue our trip along the Great Lakes and promote Ukraine.''</p>
        <p>The Connecticut Friends of Ukraine Expedition, a group formed to help raise money for the OpSail activities, has agreed to remain intact and work to support the ship's future ventures. Steve Femiak, a founder of the group, said it would have to raise as much as $100,000 for new sails and other equipment.</p>
        <p>The Bat'kivshchyna and its crew became famous for their penniless persistence. The ship spent most of May lost in the Atlantic, low on fuel and without radar, radio or a satellite phone. Against these odds and despite damage from the 8,000-mile voyage, ''the Bat'' joined OpSail in Virginia, midway through the parade from Puerto Rico to Portland, Me.</p>
        <p>Although the ship was the official representative of Ukraine, it had no government financing or private sponsor. But the ship proved to be a hit, especially among Ukrainian-Americans. Donations of food and supplies poured in. To cover other expenses, the crew hawked T-shirts and trinkets in every port.</p>
        <p>''It was big successes,'' Captain Biriukovich said, sitting on a bench alongside his ship docked in New London's Waterfront Park. ''Success not for the crew. Success not for us, but for Ukraine. In New York City, it was the greatest success.''</p>
        <p>After New York, the ship sailed north to New London and Portland. It also went to events in Halifax and Philadelphia. The Bat'kivshchyna then returned to New London and began to make arrangements for repairs and to search for a place to spend the winter. In the meantime, the ship has received a steady stream of visitors each day, many bearing food and other provisions.</p>
        <p>Linda Judge, an engineering analyst who works in a building overlooking the pier, said she began visiting the ship daily just to say hello. One cool day, she brought over some coats. Another day, she brought Girl Scout cookies and Tang drink mix. ''You can't get much better than that,'' she said.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, Walt and Rose Clark, who own a farm in nearby Colchester, drove up with fresh corn, carrots, beets, string beans and Swiss chard. Someone at the New London farmers' market had told them that the ship needed food.</p>
        <p>John Peter Wronowski, the owner of the nearby Thames Shipyard, has agreed to allow the Bat'kivshchyna to enter his dry dock free, a donation that supporters said would amount to about $10,000. Planned repairs include cleaning and painting the hull and replacing part of the keel that broke when the ship hit ground in the Dnieper River in Ukraine.</p>
        <p>New London officials said that the ship would interfere with other vessels and could stay only until it entered dry dock. But interest was quickly expressed by several Connecticut and Long Island towns willing to put ''the Bat'' up for the winter. The ship's supporters are leaning toward Norwich, about 12 miles up the Thames River.</p>
        <p>Ronald Aliano, owner of the Marina at American Wharf in Norwich, offered free docking at a recently built ferry dock that is not yet in use. The captain visited the site on Thursday and said he liked it.</p>
        <p>Captain Biriukovich and his wife do plan to return home to Kiev, just not by ship. A two-month voyage by sea, only to turn around and make the trip right back to be in the Great Lakes by spring, is not practical or affordable. Instead, once the dry dock repairs are complete, they will leave the ship in the care of local supporters and fly home.</p>
        <p>Until then, he plans to remain with the ship, bathing with a daily swim in the Thames, using the nearby Union Railroad Station's bathroom and welcoming his steady stream of guests. ''Every day, I hurry to wake up and wash and swim because visitors are waiting for us,'' he said.</p>
