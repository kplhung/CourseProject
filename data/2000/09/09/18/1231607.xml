        <p>With the retirement last week of Paul Maritz, Microsoft lost a field general from the company's bitter computer wars of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Maritz, a soft-spoken technologist who came to Microsoft from Intel in 1986, who oversaw the Redmond, Wash., company's rise to operating system supremacy.</p>
        <p>A half a decade later, in 1995, Mr. Maritz was a key architect of Microsoft's strategy for the Internet, which made Netscape Communications a prime target -- an approach that ultimately led to the Justice Department's antitrust suit.</p>
        <p>During the trial that followed, Mr. Maritz was the company's highest-ranking official to testify, denying words that he had been accused of saying during a meeting with Intel executives: that Microsoft had intended to ''cut off Netscape Communication's air supply'' by giving away competing software for free.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maritz's departure was unexpected, although he had stepped down last year from his position as the company's No. 3 executive to focus more on future technology issues.</p>
        <p>The company said only that he was leaving for ''personal reasons.'' Several Microsoft employees said there was no bitter dispute leading to his departure and that he would maintain some ties with the company.</p>
        <p>He said he was hoping for some ''quiet time'' in the next month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maritz, who was born in Zimbabwe, said he planned to spend more time in Africa, where he has a large ranch and where he has been deeply involved in environmental issues.</p>
