        <p>The Giants are not nearly so confident to think they should win any game easily, so squeaking by the Chicago Bears today did not provide a relief as much as it did a boost to their egos.</p>
        <p>The Giants were not dominating, and they certainly made their share of mistakes, but they could appreciate their 14-7 victory over the Bears at Soldier Field.</p>
        <p>This was a game rife with the danger of a letdown, with the Bears a desperate team in their home opener after two losses. And the Giants were trying to resist any thought about a matchup with the Washington Redskins next week.</p>
        <p>''In the past, this is a game we would've let slip through our hands,'' running back Tiki Barber said. ''I think we played with a little more maturity and resolve. The way these guys play with cohesion allows us to fight through adversity and pull out a win.''</p>
        <p>The victory confirmed what players have said for weeks: this is a different, more mature team immune to letdowns.</p>
        <p>The Giants are assured of entering next Sunday night's game against Washington in sole possession of first place in the National Football Conference East. And the Giants and the Jets are both 3-0 for the first time in their 40 seasons of overlapping history.</p>
        <p>The Giants were not overly convincing today, but they did win under completely different conditions than in past weeks. The running game had its spurts, especially in a game-deciding third-quarter drive that was capped by Barber's 3-yard touchdown run. And Barber fumbled in the fourth quarter, wasting a scoring opportunity and giving the Bears another chance at trimming the 14-7 deficit.</p>
        <p>''I'm not happy with some of the things we did today, but maybe it's a sign of how far we've come mentally,'' Coach Jim Fassel said. ''The reason we were underdogs -- and I told the team -- is people think we're going to let down, we're not going to have any fight in us. Well, we made some mistakes, but I think we have plenty of fight in us.''</p>
        <p>During the game, though, Fassel could not help but think of the missed opportunities and he considered the possibility of a 23-7 loss.</p>
        <p>''It was driving me crazy,'' Fassel said. ''You have to stop thinking about it.''</p>
        <p>Still, the constant for the Giants has been the defense, which has resembled the dominant units of previous years. That defense has allowed only 41 points in three games.</p>
        <p>Today Chicago's running attack managed just 48 yards, 18 in the second half after Bears center Olin Kreutz was lost to a knee injury. Running back Curtis Enis (13 yards on five carries) was booed repeatedly.</p>
        <p>The Giants have allowed only 147 yards on the ground in three games. Chicago had 54 yards of offense in the second half.</p>
        <p>The New York defense has been happy to praise the offense, but did not mind the responsibility of having to protect today's victory.</p>
        <p>''We like it that way,'' defensive tackle Keith Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>It came down to that because place-kicker Brad Daluiso missed his third field-goal attempt with 1 minute 8 seconds remaining. Daluiso's 31-yard effort was blocked by Mike Brown of the Bears, and that maintained the 14-7 score and allowed Chicago one last chance.</p>
        <p>After quarterback Cade McNown completed an 8-yard pass to Marcus Robinson, he overthrew Robinson on a post pattern and then failed to connect with receiver Dez White on third down. When McNown's fourth-down pass to tight end Alonzo Mayes was also incomplete, John Fox, the Giants' defensive coordinator, threw his arms up in celebration with 19 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Respect seemed to be something missing from this defense until now, Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, they doubt us and there probably still are some doubters, saying we haven't played anyone,'' he said. ''I guess Washington will be the big test for us.''</p>
        <p>Neither Barber nor Ron Dayne had the gaudy rushing numbers they produced in the previous two games. But they dominated when needed, with the Giants running on nine straight plays in the third quarter. Held without a run beyond 19 yards, Barber finished with 86 yards on 17 carries. Dayne had 69 on 19 attempts.</p>
        <p>Barber's touchdown run came on a pseudo reverse play from the Bears' 3 with 5:26 left in the third quarter. Barber took a handoff, ran right and used a block from guard Glenn Parker to trot into the end zone. The Giants had seen Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn do the same thing against Chicago last year.</p>
        <p>The Giants looked as if they would dominate early. Quarterback Kerry Collins completed all four of his passes in the opening drive, each to a different receiver. His 34-yard touchdown pass to the rookie receiver Ron Dixon was placed perfectly in the right corner of the end zone.</p>
        <p>But Daluiso's second missed field-goal attempt, when Bard Maynard could not grip the ball on the hold, left the score 7-0 with 3:22 left in the half. The Bears took over at their 26-yard line and capped a 12-play drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass from McNown to Eddie Kennison in the left side of the end zone. The pass barely eluded a diving Jason Sehorn. Chicago tied the score, 7-7, with 14 seconds left in the half.</p>
        <p>But the touchdown was costly for the Bears.  Bobby Engram, a star receiver, sprained his right knee catching a 9-yard pass on the Giants' 2-yard line to set up the score. He left the game, removing Chicago's best option on slant plays.</p>
        <p>The Giants' offensive line appeared especially strong. Collins was not pressured until the Bears rookie Brian Urlacher sacked him early in the second quarter. After that, the offense sputtered, but it wound up dominating in one critical category: it possessed the ball for more than 38 of the game's 60 minutes, again giving the defense a breather and wearing out the Bears' defenders.</p>
        <p>Linebacker Mike Barrow said, ''A great offense makes a great defense.''</p>
        <p>Fassel told the team the defensive line would have to provide pressure because the Giants would not call many blitzes. Barrow and linebacker Jessie Armstead each had one sack, but each came on the player's decision. Defensive end Michael Strahan and Hamilton also had a sack each.</p>
        <p>Chicago was not without its blunders. The Bears were booed for trying and missing a 49-yard field-goal attempt in the second quarter, despite having a fourth-and-1 on the Giants' 31-yard line. With his team still struggling for any semblance of a drive in the fourth quarter, Kennison was penalized 15 yards for head-butting Giants cornerback Dave Thomas.</p>
        <p>Thomas had pushed Kennison after the play and Kennison responded by smacking Thomas with his helmet.</p>
