        <p>In a Jim Borgman cartoon, Al Gore is pictured grabbing and passionately kissing George Bush as the debate moderator says, ''I know it worked for you at the convention, Mr. Gore, but traditionally debates begin with a handshake.''</p>
        <p>The two major parties have just astounded the public and themselves by selecting a single, fair-minded moderator for all three debates who could handle such a surprise. If the audio were to conk out for 27 minutes, as in the Ford-Carter debate, Jim Lehrer might even have the quickness of mind to suggest the men at the lecterns take a load off their feet.</p>
        <p>''Lehrer's the best,'' said NBC's Tim Russert. Lehrer of PBS now holds the title and wields the power of ''America's Moderator'' because he has earned the trust of voters and pols alike, and has demonstrated his professional mastery of all three of the chosen formats.</p>
        <p>The first -- with debaters behind lecterns -- favors Gore, who pulverized Ross Perot and Jack Kemp (though Dan Quayle more than held his own against a combative Gore).</p>
        <p>The second -- three guys around a table, with a looser give-and-take -- tends to favor Bush, who wanted that format from the start of negotiations.</p>
        <p>The final scheduled debate -- in a town-hall atmosphere with questions from supposedly undecided voters -- is the trickiest. It favors neither candidate, provided no partisan ringers are allowed and the moderator knows beforehand generally what to expect from audience participants.</p>
        <p>This means that what will soon be called ''the debate process'' is working. No splinter-party candidate getting in the way; no networks pouting and pulling out because their talent was not chosen; no format edge to either candidate.</p>
        <p>It also means that a hidden campaign is now in full swing: debate preparation is all, as we tensely await relaxed demeanors. New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg spars with Bush in private to anticipate the Gore thrusts; former Long Island Congressman Tom Downey plays Bush to help Gore overcome the likability gap.</p>
        <p>By coincidence, this is the same talented Downey who lost his ''safe'' seat in 1992 to an underrated G.O.P. upstart named Rick Lazio. Now a candidate for the Senate, the again-underrated Lazio debated Hillary Clinton last week. Looking at that local prelim before national bouts, we see how  debates may affect campaigns.</p>
        <p>In New York City, where Clinton must win big, the three major newspapers gave the edge to the New Yorker. Lazio, though a Casey Stengel misquoter, reminded viewers that he ''gets the job done'' for New York, while the Arkansas traveler kept icily if outdatedly running against Newt Gingrich. Rick's baldfaced stunt -- getting Hillary to refuse to sign a pledge to reject soft money -- worked to the extent that her discombobulation dominated subsequent sightbites.</p>
        <p>Who won votes? Partisans of both candidates deepened their convictions, as Hillary played the victim of space-invading aliens and Rick showed himself able to carry the fight to his opponent. But few undecideds found her more trustworthy or him weightier.</p>
        <p>What did emerge -- unremarked in all spinning -- was sharp disagreement on a key state issue: whether or not New York State should encourage casino gambling.</p>
        <p>The debate revealed that Clinton favors gambling interests, ostensibly to stimulate jobs near the Canadian border. Lazio opposes helping the growth of gambling; it undermines families, corrupts public officials, ruins lives by hooking gambling addicts and enshrines something-for-nothing in place of the work ethic.</p>
        <p>Here is a moral issue. Following Hillary's lead, New York Democrats would adopt Mississippi's fiscal policy and thereby rake in heavy contributions from casino operators. That sleazy prospect gives Lazio the opening to emphasize how gambling most exploits those in poverty; how ''slots for tots'' can lead to lifetime addiction; and how his opponent is selling out the poor and the young.</p>
        <p>That's an example of how the unexpected in debates could affect elections. Despite prepared one-liners and readied ripostes, Bush and Gore in debate may emphasize policy differences or reveal personality differences that ignite interest and forge public opinions. That's why the clear winners in debates 2000, fellow voter, are thee and me.</p>
