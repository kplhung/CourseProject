        <p>Uncertain Election Plan In Peru Concerns U.S.  The sudden decision by Peru's president, Alberto K. Fujimori, to call new elections and not run in them himself took the United States and all of Latin America by surprise, officials said. While welcoming the move, they expressed concern that Peru might face a period of unrest and voiced uncertainty about what role its army might play.</p>

        <p>Battle-Filled Peace in Congo  A complicated war is being fought in the jungles of Congo, despite a peace accord signed in August 1999 by all the country's major combatants. A rebel leader has challenged President Laurent Kabila to declare whether he will abide by the peace agreement. Few of the terms have been met by any of the parties.</p>

        <p>Cold Shoulder for Arms System  Many officials have visited Greenland in recent months, hoping to influence whether it will accept the use of an American air base there as part of a national missile defense system. But whoever occupies the White House next year will probably find that public opinion in Greenland is skeptical, bordering on hostile, to the idea.</p>

        <p>Tough Message for Kremlin  Vladimir V. Gusinsky, the Russian media tycoon whose arrest in June put a harsh spotlight on the Kremlin's blunt use of its powers against media critics, met with with journalists and politicians in New York last week and cast himself as the protector of a free Russian press under siege by the government of Vladimir V. Putin.</p>

        <p>Criticism of Iran's Clerics  Mohsen Kadivar, a Muslim cleric and confidant of President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, has spent time in jail for his newspaper commentaries, but he continues to speak out. His perceived danger to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stems from his religious expertise and conviction, and his contention that democracy can co-exist with religious life.</p>

        <p>Afghan Antidrug Aid Ending  The United Nations is winding down efforts to persuade farmers in Afghanistan, the world's largest producer of opium, to switch to alternative legal crops. Frustrated by declining support from Western donors and the indifference of the Taliban, who rule most of the country, the United Nations will end successful pilot programs this year.</p>

        <p>Chinese Bishop Rearrested  Bishop Zeng Jingmu, 81, who spent a total of more than 30 years in Chinese prisons for his loyalty to the Vatican and who had been released for President Clinton's visit in 1998, was rearrested, a Catholic foundation in the United States said.</p>

        <p>Bush Makes New Pitch To Attract Middle-Class  Gov. George W. Bush said he was determined to convince middle-income voters that they would fare better under his proposals than under Vice President Al Gore's, and he released a new campaign document, ''Blueprint for the Middle Class,'' outlining his proposals.</p>

        <p>Pennsylvania and several other swing states have recently shifted toward Mr. Gore, but in Ohio, Mr. Bush still holds a steady lead. That is good news for a campaign that has been short of good news lately. No Republican has ever been elected president without carrying Ohio.</p>

        <p>Lynne V. Cheney, the wife of the Republican vice-presidential nominee Dick Cheney, accused Mr. Gore of ''hypocrisy'' for attending what she called an ''X-rated'' fund-raiser in New York City last week after he had chided the entertainment industry for marketing inappropriate materials to children. Celebrities told some crude jokes at the event.</p>

        <p>Many of those who work in the Hollywood trenches, actually making the movies, are beginning to chafe at politicians who they say have unjustly singled out the film industry. Members of the industry are also concerned about the threat of censorship lurking beneath the talk.</p>

        <p>Florida Storm Weakens  Hurricane Gordon weakened to a tropical storm as it reached Florida's Gulf Coast. Fears of heavy damage subsided, but there was some flooding.</p>

        <p>Asian-Americans Want Inquiry  Leaders of Asian-American groups are planning to use a long-scheduled meeting with White House officials in New York today to express their outrage over the treatment of the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee and to press for an investigation of whether racism played a role in his prosecution.</p>

        <p>Health-Insurance Costs Rise  Health-insurance premiums across the country have risen by 10 percent and in some cases much more in recent months. Even as consumer prices actually fell overall last month for the first time in 14 years, health-care costs are playing havoc with people's budgets.</p>

        <p>Hospice Patients Increase  The number of Medicare patients receiving hospice care more than doubled in the last decade, federal investigators said. But they are not getting the full value of the services because they often sign up for hospice benefits just a few days or weeks before they die, federal investigators said.</p>

        <p>Honorable Discharge Proposed  Army officials recommended an honorable discharge for reserve Lt. Steve May, an openly gay Arizona lawmaker who the Army said violated its ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy by acknowledging his sexual orientation in a legislative debate.</p>

        <p>Hillary Clinton Learns New Lessons as Candidate  Hillary Rodham Clinton has come quite a distance as a United States Senate candidate since the often tense and scripted-to-the-minute days of her listening tour last year. But, in many ways, she is still perceived as an enigmatic public figure. In an interview, Mrs. Clinton said her experience campaigning on behalf of other candidates for office did not prepare her to be a candidate in New York.</p>

        <p>Do-It-Yourself Utility Plan  An East Harlem supermarket owner has found a solution to rising electric bills: he plans to become independent of the Consolidated Edison Company by installing his own electrical generator. The supermarket will be among Manhattan's smallest independent businesses making their own electricity.</p>

        <p>Inspiring Chinese Troupe  Deng Pufang, the son of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and a champion of China's 60 million disabled citizens, is in the United States on a six-city tour with 39 members of the China Disabled People's Performing Arts Troupe. The performances, including one tonight at Carnegie Hall, are proof that in China today, being blind, deaf, mentally retarded or disabled is no barrier to artistic self-realization.</p>
