        <p>There is the $11,000 laborer's job, the $30,162 position as bus driver for the elderly and the $73,825 slot for a rehabilitation counselor in the office of drug and alcohol addiction.</p>
        <p>There are 54 jobs from the Department of Public Works, and 35 more from the Department of Recreation and Parks.</p>
        <p>These are some of the more than 350 positions that would be eliminated under the 2001 budget presented Friday by Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County executive, to the County Legislature and a state panel that is overseeing his administration's troubled finances, the Nassau Interim Finance Authority.</p>
        <p>Buried in the thousands of pages of budget documents are memorandums to Margaret A. Robertson, Mr. Gulotta's budget director, from a selection of county commissioners and department heads outlining cost savings through proposed layoffs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, included those cuts in his $2.2 billion budget to help achieve $140 million in annual savings. He is also proposing four years' worth of property tax increases and the elimination of $50 million in aid to the county's towns and cities in 2003.</p>
        <p>Savings from the layoffs of about 318 union employees would amount to about $11 million, Mr. Gulotta said. Savings from the layoffs of 70 other nonunion workers and the retirement of 370 other employees -- including roughly 200 county police officers -- have also been included in Mr. Gulotta's budget.</p>
        <p>Such austere measures in an otherwise wealthy county are necessary to help manage a cumulative deficit of more than $300 million and to keep the interim finance authority from taking control of the county's financial operations, Mr. Gulotta said.</p>
        <p>''In order to cut our spending, hundreds of talented employees will be leaving our employ,'' Mr. Gulotta said in a letter to Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the finance authority, attached to the four-year budget plan. ''Many will be leaving voluntarily; others are being asked to leave. This is an unfortunate occurrence both for the employees and their families, as well as for the county. However, we can no longer afford to conduct business as usual.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gulotta's layoff plan has come under sharp criticism because it does not integrate into his budget the information from the memorandums written by his commissioners, many of which were dated last Thursday and Friday, merely hours before the budget was due.</p>
        <p>Aides to Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said the layoff savings were not listed line by line in Mr. Gulotta's budget, but were lumped into one vague budget line. They said the budget did not clearly indicate the costs of unemployment insurance or retirement pay that would result.</p>
        <p>And Anthony P. Giustino, the president of Local 830 of the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 6,000 workers in the county, said Mr. Gulotta had included no information on what county services would be affected by the layoffs.</p>
        <p>''He is going to try to fool the public by saying if he lays off Department of Public Works employees that it won't have an effect on the roads being plowed and the traffic signals being inspected,'' said Mr. Giustino, who led a loud protest outside Mr. Gulotta's offices on Thursday. ''I say it just doesn't make sense.''</p>
        <p>Darren Bloch, the chief of staff to the Democratic majority, said Mr. Gulotta should have put the layoff plans together himself. But Dianne Baumert-Moyik, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gulotta, said the job was better suited for department heads and commissioners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloch said: ''He is shifting the responsibility on how to make a layoff plan work on the department heads and on the legislature. It is his job.''</p>
        <p>Any layoffs would force Mr. Gulotta to return savings he garnered by delaying the pay of county workers for 10 days until they leave their county jobs. Mr. Giustino said laying off just one worker would force Mr. Gulotta to return $20 million in savings from four county unions that agreed to the lag payroll deal last December. But Mr. Gulotta said that he would have to return money only to the civil service union and that he had budgeted $9.2 million for that purpose.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs is opposed to the layoffs. Legislative budget hearings begin on Sept. 25.</p>
        <p>In the layoff memorandums, the two departments hit hardest are parks and public works. In the parks department, 35 positions are listed in a ''staff reduction plan'' signed by Vincent Neglia, a deputy commissioner, for a savings of $2.7 million. John M. Waltz, the departing commissioner of public works, listed $2 million in savings by cutting equipment operators, building inspectors, hydrogeologists and other workers.</p>
        <p>In a joint memorandum, the Republican and Democratic heads of the County Board of Elections cited state law to assert that it was they who had control over their budget.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baumert-Moyik said the memorandums were included as backup to the layoff proposal. But she said the details were preliminary and could change after the early retirement numbers are final. Oct. 15 is the deadline for people to choose whether to take early retirement.</p>
        <p>''We have a general concern on the impact of layoffs on revenue collection and services such as snow removal and mosquito control,'' said Robert W. Lazaro, a spokesman for Peter A. Schmitt, the Republican legislative minority leader.</p>
