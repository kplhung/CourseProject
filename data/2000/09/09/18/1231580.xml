        <p>Fortune magazine's review of ''Blind Eye: How The Medical Establishment Let a Doctor Get Away With Murder'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999) was decidedly mixed. ''This is not a subtle book,'' the reviewer wrote, ''but then, Jim Stewart books never are.''</p>
        <p>But the very relentlessness of James B. Stewart's reporting on a  homicidal doctor has made his book a useful weapon in the hands of federal legislators seeking greater scrutiny of the medical profession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart was proved right in his portrayal of Dr. Michael Swango as a serial killer who poisoned hospital patients or co-workers in at least three states.</p>
        <p>The book, which paralleled the work of federal investigators, foreshadowed Dr. Swango's guilty plea on Sept. 4 in the murders of three patients in a Long Island hospital.</p>
        <p>The new question is whether it will help the public gain access to a federally mandated database that details adverse actions that state professional boards have taken against physicians.</p>
        <p>The 10-year-old database was never consulted by the hospital administrators who hired Dr. Swango in South Dakota and New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart got his first wish; Dr. Swango was sentenced to life in prison.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Stewart is to testify on Wednesday before the House Commerce Committee on the latest effort to put the database, the National Practitioner Data Bank, on the Internet and add criminal convictions to the reports of malpractice awards and license suspensions.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the American Medical Association are also on the witness list; in the past, the A.M.A argued that access to the database should be restricted to medical professionals. As for criminal convictions, the A.M.A. says they are not necessarily relevant to a doctor's fitness to practice.</p>
