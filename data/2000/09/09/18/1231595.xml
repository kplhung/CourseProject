        <p>A year ago, Kristine Lilly saved the World Cup for the United States with her head and then helped to win it with her feet. But soccer is a mercurial game. Victory can seem like a yo-yo trick, presenting itself only to be yanked away.</p>
        <p>In the 73rd minute of tonight's 1-1 Olympic match, China was whistled for a hand ball in the penalty area and the Americans were awarded a penalty kick. Their most reliable kicker, Michelle Akers, retired several weeks ago. Their World Cup hero, Brandi Chastain, had come off for a substitution 11 minutes earlier in what might have been a tactical error by Coach April Heinrichs.</p>
        <p>Mia Hamm, the world's career-leading scorer, has acknowledged her insecurity on penalty kicks. That left Lilly, whose decisiveness has ebbed this year after she scored so assertively in the World Cup final. Lilly attempted to place the ball inside the left post. Gao Hong, the Chinese goalkeeper who was beaten five times in the World Cup penalty-kick shootout, anticipated Lilly's shot perfectly this time, diving to her right and smothering the ball. She stopped it again when Cindy Parlow tried to stuff home a rebound. The score remained 1-1. Despite outshooting China by 18-6, the United States had to settle for a tie that felt like a loss.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a good kick,'' said Lilly, who has scored only 1 goal in her last 22 matches after a career of dependability, and who had a penalty kick saved in July against Brazil. ''I don't think I got enough speed on it.''</p>
        <p>After China's bitter, controversial World Cup defeat, today's draw was cathartic. The Chinese players hugged and celebrated at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, waving to their fans, who made up most of the crowd of 32,500.</p>
        <p>Privately, China expressed some lingering bitterness from the World Cup, believing that Briana Scurry had moved illegally forward to save a penalty kick and that Lilly's forehead save of a shot in overtime had come from behind the goal line. So determined was China today that it had some of its reserves switch jersey numbers in an attempt to confuse the Americans.</p>
        <p>The United States (1-0-1) needs only a draw against Nigeria on Wednesday to advance to the Olympic semifinals, but victory is by no means certain if a rematch comes against China (1-0-1). The Chinese finished second to the Americans at Atlanta and the World Cup, but they have lost only once in their last five meetings and have not surrendered more than one goal in those matches.</p>
        <p>Today's game was splendidly fluid and much more wide open than the tense World Cup final. One team took charge and pushed forward for a few minutes, then the other imposed its will for an engaging stretch of counterpunching. Both goals appeared from nowhere.</p>
        <p>After a long dormant period for the Americans, during which China pushed its outside backs forward, played a new long-ball style and ran through the midfield made softer by Akers's absence, the United States recovered in an instant when Tiffeny Milbrett fired a topspin shot from 35 yards that Gao deflected off the crossbar. Awarded a corner kick, the Americans scored when Julie Foudy slid through four defenders and headed Shannon MacMillan's serve sharply into the net.</p>
        <p>Christie Pearce and Joy Fawcett rescued the Americans during shaky defensive moments, but the 1-0 lead did not hold. In the 67th minute, Hamm was called for a hand ball. ''I don't think I touched it,'' she said. She complained enough to draw a yellow warning card.</p>
        <p>Presented a free kick from 32 yards, China's star forward, Sun Wen, lifted the ball over the American wall, and goalkeeper Siri Mullinix could only push the shot into the bottom of the crossbar. It bounced into the empty net to equalize the score. Sun had been the most valuable player in the World Cup, but a knee injury has cost her some speed and agility. Still, she had one opportunity tonight and she made it count.</p>
        <p>''I just forget the knee injury during the game,'' Sun said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Hamm struggled tonight offensively. China compressed its defense, leaving little space for Hamm to shoot or pass.</p>
        <p>''All the players on our team want to make a difference; I'm no different,'' Hamm said. ''With a team like China, you always feel like you're chasing. When you get the ball you're pretty tired. The frustrating thing is you can't be successful.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''Great players find a way to help their team win, like Sun Wen. I didn't do that tonight.''</p>
        <p>In the 62nd minute, Heinrichs substituted Parlow for Chastain, putting three forwards into the lineup, but leaving only three defenders to protect a 1-0 lead. The decision was a trade-off. Parlow took two threatening shots on goal; Chastain appeared slow and was beaten inside in the early minutes, but she was also the most assured taker of penalty kicks.</p>
        <p>''I'm appropriately displeased and pleased,'' Heinrichs said. ''We created enough chances to win that game.''</p>
