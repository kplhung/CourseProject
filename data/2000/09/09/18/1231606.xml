        <p>Perched in a row far removed from the porcelain-like figures across the arena, a grim-faced Bela Karolyi could only fidget with his gunslinger's mustache.</p>
        <p>Out of shouting distance, Karolyi couldn't inspire the American gymnasts. Out of bearhug range, the Svengali couldn't give their spirits a good tug. Instead, Karolyi, the team's national coordinator, was helpless to erase their vacant stares, refocus their distracted demeanors or stir up their stunningly flat approach to the women's Olympic qualifying competition today at the Super Dome.</p>
        <p>''You have to say, 'We are going to eat them up alive,' '' said Karolyi, who is not allowed on the floor under USA Gymnastics guidelines. ''This is the Olympic Games. If you are down there, you eat your shoes or eat someone else up.''</p>
        <p>They had no appetite at all. Under the stoic guidance of Coach Kelli Hill, the United States was in mental disarray. Although the Americans were among the top six teams to qualify for Tuesday's team finals -- squeezing in with a disappointing sixth-place finish in the preliminaries today -- the United States was in a state of regression once again.</p>
        <p>One year ago, Karolyi came out of retirement after watching the women plummet from their standing as the 1996 gold medal winners to a sixth-place also-ran at the 1999 world championships. With Karolyi brought on board to be the coordinator, the Americans were on their way to regrouping. But today he had to wonder if his demanding training camps and extra efforts to pull the team back together had been wasted.</p>
        <p>While the United States was not counted on to topple the one-two punch of superpowers like Russia and Romania, the Americans were considered a bronze medal contender. As today's event unfolded, even the nonthreatening Chinese placed well above them, landing in third.</p>
        <p>''I don't have anything to blame it on,'' Hill said. ''I have no idea what happened. We are going to figure that question out and make sure it doesn't happen again.''</p>
        <p>They can atone for their bobbles in the team finals. The scoring begins anew, and a chance for redemption awaits. The two remaining members of the 1996 team's Magnificent Seven -- Dominique Dawes and Amy Chow -- will be looking forward to a fresh start. Usually impenetrable in her focus, Chow had a costly pause in her uneven bar routine, which left Karolyi pounding his fist in the distance, and an unpolished Dawes began her third Olympics with a fall on the balance beam.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, it's not 12 inches wide; it's 4 inches,'' said Dawes, who scored 8.6 on the event. ''I wasn't as aggressive as I wanted to be from the get-go, was bobbling all over the place in the beginning. And, unfortunately, I wasn't able to pull it together.''</p>
        <p>Everyone had difficulty. Chow, Elise Ray and Kristen Maloney -- all of whom were among the top 36 in the individual qualifying to advance to the all-around finals later this week -- suffered uncommon setbacks. During her floor routine, Ray, the United States national champion, felt a pop in her shoulder when she landed face down and out of bounds. Although she recovered quickly, her awkward landing was part of a forgettable 9.225 score.</p>
        <p>Still, Ray was the only American to place in the top eight on a single apparatus (balance beam), qualifying her for the event finals. So much more was expected.</p>
        <p>''If I was out there, I could have said many, many things,'' Karolyi said. ''Many things.''</p>
        <p>He had no outlet for his thoughts, though. He could only absorb the tension that had already begun mounting last week. Just days after the team arrived in Sydney, the wispy Morgan White departed with a stress fracture. Suddenly, the 15-year-old alternate, Tasha Schwikert, was put on the spot. Participating in two events, she showed more nerve than the more experienced Jamie Dantzscher. Dantzscher injured her ankle last week, but that didn't seem to inhibit her as much as her scattered concentration.</p>
        <p>''Dantzscher was Dantzscher,'' Karolyi said. ''She delivered typical Dantzscher. Sometimes she's brilliant. Sometimes just the opposite.''</p>
        <p>''We are going to have to come up with better and stronger and more consistent performances,'' he added. ''Everyone needs more desire and better fire for the next round.''</p>
        <p>Pouring the lighter fluid is Karolyi's specialty. He is an oft-criticized taskmaster, but few doubt his effectiveness as a motivator on the floor. In his thick Romanian accent, the architect of gymnastics has a way of pulling memorable performances out of unknowns and intimidating judges into giving his athletes an extra tenth of a point.</p>
        <p>As a spectator in the stands, his powers of persuasiveness are diluted. So why isn't he on the floor? Several years ago, USA Gymnastics officials voted to allow only coaches of team members on the floor. Although Karolyi lorded over the camps he held at his Texas ranch this past year, he is not the coach of an individual. This same rule also prevented Mary Lee Tracy, the coach of White, from remaining on the floor once her pupil was out of the competition.</p>
        <p>Today, the rules appeared in need of an amendment. While Karolyi did not publicly criticize the less impassioned Hill, the distracted state of the team was visible.</p>
        <p>''I believe they have a cramp in their neck from looking up,'' said Karolyi, referring to how some members of the team were watching replays on the jumbo screen instead of concentrating. ''They needed something internal. Maybe they need a little fire, a little pump up. But I'm too far away. They didn't know where I was.''</p>
        <p>Karolyi was out of earshot, and out of control.</p>
