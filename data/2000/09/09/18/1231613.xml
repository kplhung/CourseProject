        <p>In its September issue, Vogue magazine declared that the look of the moment was knee-length tweed coats. Starting today, Vogue's corporate parent will set out to show that the business of the moment is selling those coats, and other must-have fashions, on the Web.</p>
        <p>The new Web site, Style.Com, will incorporate fashion sense from Vogue, W magazine and eventually other titles owned by the Conde Nast and Fairchild units of Advance Publications.</p>
        <p>Like its print cousins, Style.com will be filled with news, gossip and pictures from the world of fashion as well as its editors' edicts on the shape, color, style and fabrics for the well-dressed woman. What is different from the magazines is that the site soon will enable users to act upon those edicts by instantly buying the items they are told they must have. Think of it as point-and-click from the fashion clique.</p>
        <p>To let the public become acquainted with the site, Style.com will begin with a few charity auctions. But in time for the holiday shopping season, Style.com's planners intend to be running a bustling bazaar.</p>
        <p>The Style.com store is expected to feature some big-name designers of the sort featured in Vogue and W, like Chanel and Manolo Blahnik, and the store will be run by Neiman Marcus, a unit of Harcourt General. Eventually, Advance also hopes to develop its own Style.com brand of what it calls ''basics'' -- the polite term for the sort of private label designer knock-offs that are the most profitable part of the fashion industry.</p>
        <p>Combining editorial content with e-commerce is nothing new on the Web. Think of the links many sites, including that of The New York Times, have to online booksellers or the extensive paid computer product listings on the CNet and ZDNet technology-news services.</p>
        <p>But Advance's effort may be the most ambitious effort yet by an established publisher to combine reading with retailing. And Style.com has broken new ground by overcoming some big-name designers' resistance to potentially diluting their cachet by selling wares online.</p>
        <p>Advance Publications executives say they have been forced to consider new approaches because they have little hope of replicating the company's enormously profitable fashion magazine business on the Web.</p>
        <p>''The Internet doesn't work yet for fashion advertisers who are accustomed to running in Vogue with fabulous photography on great paper,'' said Sarah Chubb, president of the CondeNet unit, which runs Style .com. Nonetheless, she said, the company's franchise gives it a huge untapped opportunity because many women use its magazines essentially as shopping catalogs.</p>
        <p>''We know people have been buying out of Vogue for years,'' she said, noting that the magazine prints the names of stores that carry the items it features. ''We always moaned that we could never capture any of those sales.''</p>
        <p>There is a big difference, of course, between telling readers where to buy something and actually selling it to them -- or even making it for them. And these new roles are fraught with both financial and ethical uncertainties. But the rise of the Internet, with its infinite possibilities and cruel realities, has prompted many publishers to consider radically new business models.</p>
        <p>''All over the industry, the lines between advertising and editorial are increasingly getting blurred,'' said Carolyn Kitch, a former editor at Good Housekeeping who now runs the magazine journalism program at Temple University. ''The problems are greater online, because publishing companies still don't know whether the Web should primarily be used as an e-commerce tool or an editorial tool.''</p>
        <p>Professor Kitch contends that by moving too much toward commerce, the publishers are putting short-term interests above long-term.</p>
        <p>''This is a problem that is industrywide that ultimately will compromise the editorial identity of the Web sites,'' she said. ''Readers will get annoyed. They are pretty sophisticated and don't want to be told where to shop.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Chubb counters that she believes Style.com's readers will appreciate the convenience of being able to order the goods the site features. Moreover, she says that the company has taken great pains to avoid misleading readers. Every page of the site will say that Neiman Marcus pays a commission on each sale to Advance Publications. And one reason the site is using a new name rather than being called, say, Vogue.com is to keep the magazine brands pure.</p>
        <p>''Style.com is going to the market as a commerce brand,'' she said. ''The magazines and Vogue.com have to be above the fray from an editorial standpoint.''</p>
        <p>For Neiman Marcus, however, it is precisely the reputation of Vogue and W that makes the deal so appealing. ''The editorial staffs of these magazines are driving the thought process in customers' minds that say she should carry this handbag this year,'' said Karen Katz, chief executive of Neiman Marcus's catalog and Internet unit. ''It generates a call to action that we can be the beneficiary of.''</p>
        <p>After the warm-up phase of charity auctions in November, Style.com will introduce its first set of fashion features with editors' picks linked to Neiman Marcus, primarily items intended for holiday gift-giving. A broader array of items will be introduced next year, with the merchandise tending toward prestigious designer brands.</p>
        <p>In another phase, the site will be broadened substantially, with content tied to Advance Publications' midbrow titles -- Mademoiselle, Jane and Glamour -- as well as its men's magazines, GQ and Details. At that point, executives say, the site will probably add another retailer, like Macy's or Nordstrom, that specializes in fashion not quite as pricey as Neiman Marcus's. Still to be determined is whether to let this retailer handle the private label basics or whether to create a Style.com label.</p>
        <p>''We'll let you click here to buy from Prada,'' Ms. Chubb said. ''But if you are not a Prada customer, you will be able to find pants that are part of the hot trend in your price range.''</p>
        <p>Professor Kitch noted that the idea of putting magazine brands on merchandise is also becoming more widespread.</p>
        <p>''Every publishing company is trying to figure out how to turn its content into products,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The impulse in not entirely new. Playboy, during the magazine's heyday in the 1960's and 70's, put its bunny logo on all sorts of products. But in the Web era, magazines' merchandising efforts are becoming much more sweeping. Primedia's Seventeen magazine, for example, has licensed its name for everything from socks to tattoos.</p>
        <p>''Seventeen is a brand that is as powerful as any other,'' said Patrice Adcroft, editor in chief of Seventeen. ''The possibilities for new sources of revenue are enormous.'' She added that Primedia was developing a plan to let users click to buy items featured on the Seventeen.com Web site.</p>
        <p>The Style.com site introduced today will feature extensive coverage of the fashion shows for the Spring 2001 collections that are being held in Manhattan this week in Bryant Park. Indeed, with staff using a combination of digital cameras and running shoes, the site promises to display every single outfit shown by all 45 designer collections within three hours of the show's opening.</p>
        <p>The site will also have news, much of it culled from Advance Publication's Women's Wear Daily; coverage of parties and events, and message boards debating hot topics like whether one can wear Capri pants after Labor Day. (Not that the final answers will be left to mere readers; every week Style.com's editors will hand down their rulings.)</p>
        <p>What the site will not have is any articles from Vogue or W magazines, a policy consistent with the way CondeNet has approached other topics. Its Epicurious food site, one of the very earliest on the Internet, has very few articles from Gourmet or Bon Appetit magazines, for example. But Epicurious does have a database of all the recipes they have published along with others from readers.</p>
        <p>''We feel we are creating something new for customers, rather than replicating what already exists,'' Ms. Chubb said.</p>
        <p>The editors at Style.com who pick the merchandise featured on the site are independent of the magazine editors. But for better or worse, the imperative that the Web site editors choose items that will actually be sold, Ms. Chubb said, will very likely keep them from highlighting the flamboyant but impractical garments that so often appear in the magazines.</p>
        <p>''Editors pick items that are off-the-charts weird -- that never show up in stores,'' she said. ''We may have the ostrich pumps, but we won't go all the way to the ostrich bathing suit.''</p>
