        <p>Verizon Communications, formerly Bell Atlantic, has named the Burrell Communications Group in Chicago, 49 percent owned by the Publicis Groupe S.A., to handle its brand introduction campaign. Spending was estimated at $20 million to $30 million.</p>
        <p>John Bonomo, a spokesman at Verizon Communications in New York, said the decision came after a three-month informal consideration of Burrell and four other Verizon roster agencies: Arnold Communications in Boston, part of Snyder Communications, which is being acquired by Havas Advertising; the Lord Group in New York, a joint venture of Dentsu Inc. and Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., which agreed to be acquired by the WPP Group; the Dallas office of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, part of WPP; and Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., part of True North Communications.</p>

        <p>The campaign will come after ads that Verizon ran in August to promote the new name; the Burrell campaign is meant to help further establish the Verizon brand in the public's mind.</p>
