        <p>SEVERAL well-known senior managers at major agencies are making moves -- some voluntarily, some not -- in shifts indicating the frenetic pace of change in the executive suites of the leading Madison Avenue shops.</p>
        <p>One voluntary move involves Rochelle Klein, an award-winning copywriter, who is leaving Tierney Communications in Philadelphia, a unit of True North Communications where she had been executive vice president and chief creative officer for almost two years. Next month, Ms. Klein, who has also worked for agencies like Angotti, Thomas, Hedge; Levine, Huntley, Schmidt &amp; Beaver; and Young &amp; Rubicam, joins Jordan McGrath Case &amp; Partners/Euro RSCG in New York in the new posts of vice chairwoman and chief creative officer.</p>
        <p>''The Tierney job has been wonderful,'' said Ms. Klein, 47. ''This felt like an opportunity to take a major agency with major clients and crank up the volume.''</p>
        <p>At an estimated $650 million, billings at Jordan McGrath, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, are about three times those at Tierney; clients of Jordan McGrath include Glaxo Wellcome; Perrier-Jouet Fleur de Champagne, part of the champagne group of Hicks Muse Tate &amp; Furst; Philips Lighting; Procter &amp; Gamble; and SmithKline Beecham.</p>
        <p>Stephen Badenhop, president at Jordan McGrath, selected Ms. Klein as his new creative partner after a six-month search, he said, during which he talked to 27 people. She will assume duties that had been handled by Ilon Specht, executive vice president and executive creative director at Jordan McGrath; Ms. Specht, who worked at Jordan McGrath for 26 years, retired during the summer.</p>
        <p>The broader nature of Ms. Klein's responsibilities reflects ''our interest in elevating the profile of our creative in the industry,'' Mr. Badenhop said, adding, ''She and I will lead the charge of making the creative product more competitive, so we can be more competitive in new business.''</p>
        <p>The goal? ''To drink a lot of Perrier-Jouet around here,'' Mr. Badenhop declared.</p>
        <p>At Bates Worldwide in New York, part of the Cordiant Communicatons Group, a management reshuffling will mean changes for four top executives.</p>
        <p>Michael Bungey, chairman and chief executive at Bates and chief executive at Cordiant, will relinquish his Bates roles in the next 12 months to concentrate on his duties at Cordiant, which expanded significantly in July with the acquisition of the Lighthouse Global Network of specialist marketing and communications businesses for $592 million in stock and debt.</p>
        <p>Jean de Yturbe, 53, group president at Bates and chairman at Bates Europe in Paris, will be named chairman at Bates within a year. Mr. de Yturbe will also be responsible for developing CCG United, the name Mr. Bungey is giving to efforts to persuade clients to use various Bates-owned agencies in fields beyond traditional advertising, like interactive marketing, design and public relations.</p>
        <p>Ian Smith, 44, group president at Bates in New York, will become chairman and chief executive at CCG.XM, the Cordiant unit overseeing e-business and online initiatives.</p>
        <p>And Bill Whitehead, 54, group president at Bates and chief executive at Bates North America in New York, is being named to the new posts of president and chief operating officer at Bates, reporting directly to Mr. Bungey. That designates him as the likely eventual successor to Mr. Bungey as the Bates chief executive.</p>
        <p>''Michael said, 'I can't run everything, so I'll start to focus on the Cordiant organization,' '' Mr. Whitehead said, adding that the shifts involving the group presidents reflected ''a refocusing of the organization to put emphasis on maintaining and building each of our core businesses.'' Bates handles accounts with billings estimated at $8.5 billion for clients like British American Tobacco, Hyundai Motor America and Wendy's International.</p>
        <p>Finally, the involuntary move involved David Page, chief creative officer at the New York office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group. Mr. Page, an art director who has also worked at agencies like Ammirati &amp; Puris; Carmichael Lynch; Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein; M&amp;C Saatchi; and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, is unexpectedly losing his job after only 18 months.</p>
        <p>''It's a question of casting rather than talent,'' said Carl Johnson, president at TBWA/Chiat/Day New York, which handles accounts with billings estimated at $400 million for accounts like the Absolut and Chivas Regal. Mr. Page was hired just before Mr. Johnson joined the agency from a sibling shop in London now known as TBWA GGT Simons Palmer.</p>
        <p>A successor to Mr. Page is being sought, said Mr. Johnson, who has been charged with revitalizing the New York office, where frequent turnover in top managers has hindered the building of long-term relationships with large clients. The recent promotion of Andrew Beaver, executive vice president, to client services director from group account director is intended to help with that problem.</p>
