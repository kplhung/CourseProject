        <p>Gov. George W. Bush said today that he was determined to convince middle-income voters that they would fare better under his proposals than under Vice President Al Gore's, and he vowed to spend the coming days making that case as emphatically as possible.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush said today that he was determined to convince middle-income voters that they would fare better under his proposals than under Vice President Al Gore's, and he vowed to spend the coming days making that case as emphatically as possible.</p>
        <p>''One of the big differences is that I want people controlling their lives,'' Mr. Bush said in a telephone interview that hewed to a theme he is working more and more aggressively: that Mr. Gore is bent on inflexible, federally mandated solutions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, sought to draw attention to a new campaign document, ''Blueprint for the Middle Class,'' which his aides released today. Essentially a 16-page, oversize pamphlet, it will be handed out at campaign events this week, and it distills his proposals for voters that Mr. Gore, with his constant references to ''working families,'' has courted both assiduously and successfully.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said the document was intended to put his agenda ''in a form where everybody can understand and people can see in specific what I have to offer.''</p>
        <p>But the document and today's interview had additional, more specific purposes, advisers to Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Tagged by Mr. Gore as a candidate on the side of big corporations and wealthy Americans, Mr. Bush was asserting that his policies would benefit all voters more than Mr. Gore's proposals would.</p>
        <p>Advisers said the phrase ''middle class'' in the document's title signaled that goal. The language also reflected opinion polls that showed some of Mr. Gore's most significant gains in the past month had been with voters in households earning  $50,000 to $75,000 a year.</p>
        <p>After the Democratic convention, at which Mr. Gore pointedly cast the race as a contest between ''the people,'' whom he pledged to champion, and ''the powerful,'' whom he said Mr. Bush represented, Mr. Bush's advisers made several adjustments.</p>
        <p>A week and a half ago, they rolled out a new slogan, ''real plans for real people,'' a phrase that appeared in large print on the cover of the ''Blueprint for the Middle Class.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Bush sought to draw attention to this new emphasis in interviews with a few reporters. The interviews were initiated by the campaign, the first time it had had Mr. Bush contact reporters to talk about his coming days of campaigning.</p>
        <p>Republican strategists said Mr. Bush was clearly trying to project a take-charge image and wrest control of the debate.</p>
        <p>''One of the ways you regain momentum,'' said a Republican strategist who occasionally advises the campaign, ''is to make clear that you're trying to regain momentum.''</p>
        <p>Along those lines, Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, held a conference call with reporters to spell out the scope of the next six days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Bush would travel 6,076 miles from Monday to Saturday, visiting 12 cities in nine states that represented 160 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign responded to the document by accusing Mr. Bush of misleading voters with selective information.</p>
        <p>In what Mr. Gore's aides titled ''A Tale of the Tape,'' they noted that Mr. Bush's document was 2,644 words and had six pictures, while Mr. Gore's ''Prosperity for America's Families,'' an economic plan he unveiled earlier this month, had 69,042 words and no pictures.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's aides said the document compressed information from a previously released, 457-page paperback book of speeches and policy prescriptions.</p>
        <p>The release of the document,  which did not include any new proposals, followed a speech on Saturday in which Mr. Bush attacked Mr. Gore's proposals in sharper language than ever before.</p>
        <p>Both developments underscored a shift in the Bush campaign, which is now focusing more intensely on the differences in the candidate's plans on Medicare, Social Security, tax cuts and education.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to make this a contest on policy,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>He said the race had reached a point where people were paying closer attention and needed to be reminded of where he stood, especially in comparison to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>''One of the things about a campaign I've learned is timing is important,'' Mr. Bush said. ''When I give one speech, it doesn't necessarily soak in, so I'm going to continue to talk about what I intend to do and where we differ.''</p>
        <p>Other comments he made suggested that the campaign had been prepared in the last seven weeks to try an array of approaches. He did not rule out making further attacks on Mr. Gore's ethics or character like the one in a television commercial several weeks ago that portrayed Mr. Gore as dishonest and politically inconsistent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he and his campaign would ''have to make those calls'' as the race proceeded. Asked whether his pledge to ''change the tone'' of politics would hurt his ability to raise questions about Mr. Gore's character, he said there was a difference between what a candidate might need to do in a campaign and how a candidate intends to govern.</p>
        <p>And he said he would govern in a more bipartisan, less acrimonious spirit than President Clinton and Mr. Gore had. That was another argument for his candidacy that he said he would be stressing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he wanted ''to remind people that I will be a different type of leader, something that hasn't been the case in the last eight years, something that will not be the case if the vice president becomes president.''</p>
        <p>Advisers said today that the document was intended to appeal to voters in households that make $30,000 to $60,000 a year. According to a New York Times/CBS News Poll released last week, Mr. Bush still led Mr. Gore among voters in households in the $30,000 to $50,000 range, but now trailed among voters in households in the $50,000 to $75,000 range.</p>
        <p>One Bush adviser said today that middle-income voters in both groups cared deeply about whether their problems and aspirations were understood by candidates, and the adviser noted that Mr. Gore came out better in this regard.</p>
        <p>The adviser said Mr. Bush also needed to reverse the loss of support among women.</p>
        <p>''I think what will help tremendously is if they hear him talking about their concerns,'' the adviser said, adding that what women and middle-income voters want ''more than anything is somebody who has empathy and understanding of where they are in their lives.''</p>
        <p>Karl Rove, the chief strategist for the Bush campaign, described these voters as ''very practical.''</p>
        <p>''They want to know: what are you going to do for them, and how does it differ from the other guy,'' Mr. Rove said. That approach will be reflected in events this week, which will trace life, from birth to old age, and talk about how Mr. Bush's proposals take into account people at each stage.</p>
        <p>On Monday Mr. Bush will visit a maternity ward in Little Rock, Ark., to talk about his proposal to double the per-child tax credit to $1,000 from $500. On Tuesday, Mr. Bush will visit an elementary school in Chicago to talk about school safety.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he was confident about his approach and about the race, which he said was ''neck and neck.''</p>
        <p>''I'm running against an incumbent,'' he said. ''The fact that this race is close I find very heartening.''</p>
