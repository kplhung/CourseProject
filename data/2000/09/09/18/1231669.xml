        <p>It was just 30 minutes after their 27-14 victory over Buffalo, but it was not too early for the Jets to be peppered with questions about you-know-who.</p>
        <p>On the day he was traded from the Jets to Tampa Bay last April, Keyshawn Johnson said that he would have Sept. 24 -- the day the Jets would play in Tampa -- circled on his calendar. He will have three news conferences this week to plumb the depths of his feelings about the Jets.</p>
        <p>The Jets got to air their feelings almost immediately yesterday. Marcus Coleman, who will most likely have to defend Johnson, said he might call Johnson this week to ask him how shocked he is that the Jets are 3-0 without him.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to it as much as he is,'' Coleman said.</p>
        <p>But some players are probably not. Johnson has taken repeated verbal jabs at Wayne Chrebet, saying Dedric Ward should be the Jets' No. 1 receiver instead of Chrebet. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde said he thought Johnson's statements were being blown out of proportion.</p>
        <p>''The media is making a bigger deal of saying he's ragging on Wayne than Keyshawn is,'' Testaverde said. ''I'm not going to get caught up in whatever he says or doesn't say. We can't be concerned with people who aren't here.''</p>
        <p>Chris Hayes is perhaps the Jet who is closest to Johnson, and he said yesterday that Johnson was like a family member and that he would root for Johnson to do well.</p>
        <p>''But when we're on the field, we're competitors,'' Hayes said. ''When we're on the field, just like in college, if I have the opportunity, I'll knock him out.''</p>
        <p>''We're 3-0,'' center Kevin Mawae said, ''and he's not here. So go tell that to him.''</p>
        <p>Nine More Tackles for Jones</p>
        <p>Linebacker Marvin Jones continued to lay waste to opposing offenses. He has led the Jets in tackles in all three games. Yesterday he had nine, giving him 30 for the season. The Jets yielded 354 yards to the Bills' offense, the most yardage they have given up this season. But the Jets were stellar against the run, giving up only 80 yards on the ground.</p>
        <p>Bills Hit by Injuries</p>
        <p>The Bills emerged banged up. Tight end Jay Riemersma sprained a knee in the first quarter and did not return. Linebacker Corey Moore sprained an ankle.</p>
