        <p>When the Jets practiced desperation heaves in training camp, quarterback Vinny Testaverde noticed that Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward, the receivers who would sprint for the end zone and hope to come down with the ball in the final seconds of a game, were being outjumped.

        <p>When the Jets practiced desperation heaves in training camp, quarterback Vinny Testaverde noticed that Wayne Chrebet and Dedric Ward, the receivers who would sprint for the end zone and hope to come down with the ball in the final seconds of a game, were being outjumped. So Testaverde turned to his coaches with an idea: give him the 6-foot-2-inch cornerback Marcus Coleman, who has the vertical leap of a basketball player and a bit of experience as a receiver, going back to his sophomore year in high school, the last time he caught a pass.</p>
        <p>The Jets practice two-minute drills at the conclusion of nearly every practice, and this play -- enter Coleman as a slot receiver, send him straight to the end zone and let him go up and get the ball -- had worked a handful of times. So today, with the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets tied at 14-14 with 19 seconds left in the first half and the Jets at Buffalo's 45-yard line, Coach Al Groh called for one of the most thrilling plays in football.</p>
        <p>Too bad Coleman did not know it. He did not realize his star turn was on the horizon until his teammates began screaming at him to get in the game. He got on the field late, lining up inside Chrebet on the right side. With the snap, he ran untouched to the end zone and into a clutch of three Bills defenders. But all three were behind Coleman, not between him and the ball.</p>
        <p>Testaverde, who had never successfully completed such a play for a touchdown in his career, looked only for Coleman and lofted the ball high above the end zone. When the maelstrom cleared, the ball was cradled in Coleman's hands and the clock had ticked to zero. The 45-yard touchdown deflated the Bills -- Coach Wade Phillips said it turned the game around -- and gave the Jets a halftime lead they would not relinquish on the way to a 27-14 victory that gives them early possession of first place in the American Football Conference East. It also sets up a battle of undefeated teams when the Jets (3-0) go to Tampa Bay (3-0) next week for the inaugural Keyshawn Bowl, a game that will spotlight the player the Jets needed Coleman to replace on that play.</p>
        <p>''It was a better 7-point lead,'' Coach Al Groh said. ''The math reads the same but it was better for our heart.''</p>
        <p>The Jets had won their first two games largely on heart, fashioning scintillating but anxiety inducing fourth-quarter comebacks in both.  Testaverde has still not ironed out all the kinks (he was 16 of 32 for 188 yards with 1 touchdown and 1 interception) but in their best overall performance of the young season, the Jets relied on revitalized special teams (a kickoff returned for a touchdown, a blocked field goal and two recovered fumbles on punt coverage), a routinely good defense (Bills quarterback Rob Johnson was sacked twice and repeatedly flushed out of the pocket) and an opportunistic offense with Testaverde showing well-timed flashes of his Pro Bowl form to get out to their best start since 1966. That year, the Jets began 4-0-1 before finishing 6-6-2.</p>
        <p>Coleman's leap was only one of a series of dramatic plays that the Jets stitched together. Coleman, in fact, had slipped in the chewed up end zone grass on the Bills' first touchdown, allowing Eric Moulds to get past him for the 3-yard touchdown catch that gave the Bills a 7-0 lead. But Kevin Williams, who was returning kicks in the Jets' efforts to boost what had been moribund special-teams play, quickly showed that Groh's passionate talk with the special teams this past week had paid off. Williams took the ensuing kickoff at the 3-yard line and headed straight up the left side. He never cut back, but hurdled one player, nearly slipped, windmilled his arm to keep his balance, waited for two key blocks from the rookies John Abraham and Anthony Becht and sprinted 97 yards for the touchdown.</p>
        <p>The Jets took the lead after punter Tom Tupa nailed a 70-yarder, his longest as a Jet and the second longest of his career. The Bills opened that drive on the 20-yard line and went backward, ending up on the 7-yard line after linebacker Roman Phifer sacked Johnson.</p>
        <p>When the Bills punted from the end zone, the Jets got the ball back on the Bills' 36-yard line. When the drive stalled eight plays later, the Jets faced fourth-and-1 on the 5. The safe thing to do when facing one of the league's best defenses would have been to kick the field goal. Instead, Groh opted for a trap play and Curtis Martin, who finished with 84 yards, scored the touchdown.</p>
        <p>Coleman's heroics were set up after he and Victor Green failed to stop Bills receiver Jeremy McDaniel on the 74-yard touchdown catch that tied the score. But the Bills seemed to unravel after Coleman's catch. On the first drive of the second half, a 43-yard field goal was blocked when Shane Burton got his hand on the ball.</p>
        <p>While John Hall would kick two field goals, of 51 and 27 yards, the Bills self-destructed. After Testaverde was intercepted by Bills linebacker Sam Cowart, the Bills' drive ended when Peerless Price fumbled and Green recovered at the Jets' 13-yard line. The Jets went three and out on that drive, but Chris Watson fumbled Tupa's punt and Bernie Parmalee recovered. Watson fumbled Tupa's next punt, too, and this time Chris Hayes, who had caused Watson's first fumble, recovered.</p>
        <p>''It seemed like Murphy's Law,'' Phillips said. ''Every time something went good for us, everything went bad.''</p>
        <p>Everything is good now for the Jets, and they will head into what is sure to be Keyshawn Johnson's verbal barrage with smiles masking their gritted teeth. Johnson remains close to many members of the Jets -- Hayes said he is like family to him -- but Johnson no doubt had hoped that the Jets would not do so well without him. His trade raised plenty of eyebrows in the Jets locker room and Testaverde has expressed his disappointment that Johnson is gone. But Johnson will get a look at the newfangled Jets team that is off to a better start than any he enjoyed in New York.</p>
        <p>''This team, with all the changes and the losses we had -- player-wise and coaches-wise -- we've got a pretty tough team,'' Testaverde said. ''I like the team we have in this locker room.''</p>
