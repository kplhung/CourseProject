        <p>It was a boom-and-bust evening at the Sydney World Record Factory, officially known as the Sydney International Aquatic Center.</p>
        <p>The booms were generated by Tom Dolan, who defended his Olympic title in the men's 400-meter individual medley and broke his six-year-old world record in the process, and by Brooke Bennett, who won the women's 400 freestyle and was soon shedding enough tears of joy to make one wonder if the water around her might rise.</p>
        <p>In all, Americans won 6 of the 12 medals available tonight, putting the brakes on Australia's momentum.</p>
        <p>But Jenny Thompson was not among those on the podium. Though she came to Sydney hoping to win her first individual gold medal, she could do no better than fifth tonight in the 100 butterfly, an event in which she once held the world record until Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands, who dominated tonight's race, began stretching the boundaries of her sport.</p>
        <p>''I really tightened up at the end,'' said Thompson, who has won more Olympic gold medals than any other American woman (six) but has won all of them in relays. ''I guess I just wanted it too much.''</p>
        <p>Thompson's most recent victory came Saturday, the first day of competition here, when she anchored a world-record effort in the 4x100 relay on perhaps the most extraordinary evening in the history of swimming.</p>
        <p>World records were broken five times in four finals, and though tonight's pace was not quite as torrid, three more world records were set. The first came in the semifinals of the men's 200 freestyle, and those who witnessed Ian Thorpe's performances on opening night might be surprised to learn that he was not the record-breaker. It was Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands, who shaved 16-hundredths of a second off Thorpe's mark to finish in 1 minute 45.35 seconds. Thorpe nearly seized the record back in the second semifinal, recording a 1:45.37 that meant he would have to settle for Lane 5 instead of his customary Lane 4 in Monday's final.</p>
        <p>The next world record went to de Bruijn in the 100 butterfly. She took three-hundredths of a second off the mark she set in July to win in 56.61 seconds, well ahead of the silver medalist, Martina Moravcova of Slovakia, who underwent thyroid surgery last year after learning she had Graves' disease. Dara Torres, the 33-year-old American, won the first individual medal of her uncommon career by finishing third in 58.20. Thompson started strongly and led de Bruijn for the first half-length but faded badly on the final lap and finished in 58.73, more than a second off her personal best. She now has one more chance for individual gold, in the 100 freestyle.</p>
        <p>The bad news for Thompson is that de Bruijn will be in that event as well. De Bruijn, an outgoing 27-year-old from Barendrecht who swims for clubs in the Netherlands and Brazil, has now broken or rebroken nine world records in the last five months and holds the world marks in the 100 butterfly, 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle. But de Bruijn made it clear that her first Olympic medal was the highlight of her career.</p>
        <p>''The world records I set before the Games do mean a lot, but a world record can be taken away,'' she said. ''A gold medal will never be taken away.''</p>
        <p>What also cannot be eliminated, in this era of widespread suspicion about exceptional performance, is speculation about de Bruijn's methods. Earlier this year, an Australian rival, Susie O'Neill, called de Bruijn's serial record-breaking ''pretty suss,'' meaning suspect, although she later apologized.</p>
        <p>''Of course I had a very rough time with the accusations,'' de Bruijn said. ''I'm an emotional person, and it really got to me.''</p>
        <p>If the swimmers maintain this pace over the next six days, they will break 32 world records before they are finished. Is it the new bodysuits? Is it the pool design? Or something else?</p>
        <p>''I think 18,000 people screaming their heads off doesn't hurt,'' Dolan said. ''You could have a foot of water in there, but when you have that kind of electricity running through the building, it's amazing.''</p>
        <p>Despite severe asthma and despite knee surgery in May, Dolan, a 25-year-old Virginian, has managed to endure, as had the world record he set in the 400 individual medley at the 1994 world championships in Rome. But tonight he knocked that record out with a swim that looked more like a statement, and when he had finished in 4:11.76, he hoisted himself onto a lane marker and screamed and pumped his fist. That his teammate Erik Vendt had won the silver medal only improved his mood.</p>
        <p>Though Bennett was not as demonstrative, she was just as moved. She won an Olympic gold medal in 1996 in the 800 freestyle at age 16 but failed to qualify in the 400. Now, like her role model, Janet Evans, Bennett has won both Olympic distance freestyle events. She won the 400 in 4:05.80, while her teammate Diana Munz finished second.</p>
        <p>''The 400 has just been kind of a battle for me, and after the trials in 1996, I started to get stronger, and I grew and was gaining more speed in the water,'' she said. ''It's just been kind of a back-and-forth roller-coaster type of thing.''</p>
