        <p>YOU'VE got to close your eyes and stretch the imagination -- and I mean, really lay it out there -- after a blowout the magnitude of 119-72, but here goes. If the Dream Team has a date with destiny, a time and place when the cocky American basketball professionals look up at an Olympic scoreboard that casts them as losers, the country that is going to achieve this miracle is China, the one that took a brutal drubbing here last night.</p>
        <p>It is pointless to guess the year -- at this rate, who among us can even guarantee that there will be an Olympics by 2012? And maybe Alonzo Mourning was right when he said, ''It won't be in my lifetime,'' but the growing consensus is that if anyone emerges in the role the Soviets used to play against the American collegians, it will have to be China, the country now representing basketball's final frontier.</p>
        <p>Since 1992, since Dream Team I, the onetime hopefuls like the old Soviet powerhouse and the pre-Balkanized Yugoslavia have been demystified, downscaled from potential threats to benign subdivisions. But the Chinese keep getting better and bigger, and they showed up for the opener of David Stern's latest dunk-and-pony show with two young and exceedingly skilled front-line giants who required only a brief stretch of first-half minutes to open one set of old coaching eyes.</p>
        <p>''I was stunned by what I saw, by their skills,'' the United States assistant coach Larry Brown said after sizing up 7-foot-5 Yao Ming and his front-line partner, 7-1 Wang Zhizhi, heralded here in Sydney as the Great Wall of China.</p>
        <p>Predictably, neither the 20-year-old Yao nor the 21-year-old Wang could avoid the touch fouls and hold up very long against the likes of Mourning and Kevin Garnett. They are in serious need of weight training and better coaching and all the variables they can't get by being forced to remain in China. But they are just babies, with years to improve, and one of the points that Brown was making was that if Beijing does get the 2008 Olympics, we all know the win-at-home drill by now. You can bet the Chinese will want to maximize their medal chances in basketball, a boom sport since images of Michael Jordan began infiltrating their country via satellite in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>The most prudent acceleration program on earth is the one only available in the States. So if there is any truth to the legend that China literally has millions of young dribblers out of a population of 1.2 billion, don't be surprised to see many of them coming soon to a place of higher learning near you. Duke. Rutgers. Marquette. The Bob Knight Institute for the Wayward and Weak.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if and when Wang and Yao leave China, forget it, they will be professionals as fast as Stern can say, ''With the first pick of the N.B.A. draft. . . .'' Actually, Wang has been drafted by the Dallas Mavericks. As for Yao, who made the 6-10 Mourning look like a small forward standing alongside him, it wouldn't hurt the Knicks' general manager, Scott Layden, to put Patrick Ewing and David Falk on hold for 20 minutes and dial up Sydney for a first-hand report.</p>
        <p>The one the United States coaches read, Brown said, was apparently mistaken. ''Our scouting said that the big kid, Yao, was like Shawn Bradley,'' he said. ''But I'm sitting there looking at him, the way he moves, the fundamental passing and ball-handling skills that he already has, and I'm thinking that in four years, he could be one of the best players in the world.''</p>
        <p>Yao rejected an airborne Vince Carter -- O.K.? And for a few juicy minutes early in the game, he was a dominating presence in the defensive paint, jump-starting a couple of fast breaks that ended with Wang, a 7-footer who hangs, scoring at the other end. China actually had a 16-12 lead but then came the fouls, and the Americans' suffocating perimeter defense and transition quickness steered the game to its inevitable result.</p>
        <p>Wang, Brown decided, looked like one of those ''7-footers who plays like a four.'' In other words, a left-handed finesse player with the ability to step out and hit the perimeter shot, as he did facing up against Garnett on one occasion when hitting a 3.</p>
        <p>Wang and Yao are athletes, nothing like the standard clunky big men, the Luc Longleys the rest of the world has generally produced. They walk like players. Yao talked like one, stopping for a casual chat with American reporters on his way to the locker room.</p>
        <p>''China is worried about losing their best players to the N.B.A.,'' he said. ''But they won't lose them because they'll come back and spread the knowledge.''</p>
        <p>What the Chinese and everyone else in the world still lack, Brown said, are the midsize athletes to carry out a defensive scheme. Yet after seeing Yao and Wang, Brown added: ''I can't imagine them not being the next power in the world. If they get the Olympics in Beijing in 2008, I don't want to be in their bracket.''</p>
        <p>He was getting far ahead of himself. But then, that was the subject, the whole point, as opposed to the 47 that separated the countries last night.</p>
