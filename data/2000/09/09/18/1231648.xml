        <p>A fresh tar smell rose from the roadway to Pier 92 at West 55th Street on Thursday night, and upstairs in the public restrooms, Escada Homme had been used for high-end fumigation.

Escada is to German fashion roughly what St. John Knits is to Americans -- important advertisers and a formidable retail force, but hardly a house to make editors' antennas quiver.

        <p>A fresh tar smell rose from the roadway to Pier 92 at West 55th Street on Thursday night, and upstairs in the public restrooms, Escada Homme had been used for high-end fumigation. Models racing off the street in their denim skirts and flip-flops ran the gantlet of paparazzi, who couldn't be bothered since there were celebrities to be bagged. Escada is to German fashion roughly what St. John Knits is to Americans -- important advertisers and a formidable retail force, but hardly a house to make editors' antennas quiver. Perhaps for that reason, the front rows of its show, staged on the day before Fashion Week officially opened at the pier where Cunard liners tie up, were occupied not by editorial priestesses but with B-list celebrities.</p>
        <p>There was Raquel Welch looking barely a day older than she did in ''One Million Years B.C.,'' despite the intervening epochs. There was Ivana Trump in a decollete minidress and diamond earrings about the size of the New York State Theater chandeliers. There was the perennial mini-series star Jane Seymour somehow projecting cool on a broiling evening despite being clad in a Creamsicle-colored Escada sweater trimmed in matching fur.</p>
        <p>''It's fun and young, and everything goes with everything,'' Ms. Seymour said of the label. ''And whenever I wear it, men say to me, 'I want my wife to get something like that.' '' She paused. ''You know, a lot of men are so bored with their wives' wearing black.''</p>
        <p>It could equally be supposed that a lot of men are just bored with their wives, which might explain the sudden interest when Lucy and Relinda Vasquez came on the scene. The two gorgeous sisters teetered up the red carpet in Versace demidresses. Suddenly, everyone wanted their names.</p>
        <p>''Are you models?'' one paparazzo shouted.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Relinda Vasquez said.</p>
        <p>''Actresses?''</p>
        <p>''No.''</p>
        <p>''Then what are you?'' another photographer asked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vasquez tilted her heart-shaped face and flashed a beauty queen smile: ''We're Venezuelan.''</p>
        <p>What is style? It's a channel, it's a mania, it's an excuse to stay oblivious of important world issues. During Fashion Week, style is of course the word on everyone's lips. As an arbiter of style, it's hard to better Polly Mellen, the former Vogue and Allure editor, currently a much-in-demand stylist, and a prime exponent of a form of unapologetically gaga fashionspeak that, alas, may soon become extinct.</p>
        <p>So exuberant are Ms. Mellen's loopy proclamations on style that she virtually stole ''Unzipped'' -- still perhaps the canniest movie ever about fashion -- and then inspired its director, Douglas Keeve, to make another fashion movie, this one about her. Why not? Wherever one goes in fashion circles, one finds people able to quote Ms. Mellen's zany utterances. (To Isaac Mizrahi: ''You pest! You pest! You adorable pest!'')</p>
        <p>Reached by phone last Wednesday on the morning before Gen Art's  sixth annual Fresh Faces in Fashion show -- where she was awarded an Emerging Designers Advocate award -- Ms. Mellen was asked to give a definition of style.</p>
        <p>''It's brio,'' she said without hesitation. ''It's this mixture that gives everything personality. Look at Chloe Sevigny. If you analyze what she's putting on, it's just the ugliest dress with the strangest belt, this curious mixture of boy and girl. Yet, when she puts it all together with such confidence, it becomes stylish. She gives it a twist!''</p>
        <p>''Fame Costs Money Buys Happiness.'' So said a sign at Fressen, a club in the meatpacking district where a party for Dazed &amp; Confused, an independent fashion magazine, was held on Friday. The first part of the equation is as uncontroversial as the second is misguided. Strung together, however, the words form a Zen koan for the world the magazine so brilliantly describes.</p>
        <p>It's the realm -- let's call it Celebrityland -- where the many vectors of pop culture intersect. As the shrewdest of that crop of limited circulation magazines that challenged both the editorial strictures and the market hegemony of Vogue, Dazed &amp; Confused has, curiously, become famous in its own right.</p>
        <p>Dazed &amp; Confused is where Alexander McQueen once devoted a guest-edited issue to portraying people with serious disabilities in ways that were legitimately chic. It's the magazine in which the gay novelist Dennis Cooper once said, ''I'm not interested in being gay,'' and where Keith Richards once jokingly claimed to be turning a village hall in West Wittering, England, into a satanic temple.</p>
        <p>Much of Dazed &amp; Confused cannot be translated or reproduced, at least in these pages. That may be partly why the party drew not the usual uptown fashionistas, but young photographers and models, and the celebrities they love. Although a promised Kate Moss never turned up to be D.J., the hip-hop entrepreneur Russell Simmons came, as did the Wallflowers singer Jakob Dylan, and the Jamaican model Stacey McKenzie and one of Fashion Week's most sought-after boldface people, the Icelandic singer and actress Bjork.</p>
        <p>She arrived early, wearing Minnie Mouse shoes, and stayed in a corner studiously avoiding entreaties from the press. This was not surprising from a pop star who claims as a seminal inspiration the work of the French Surrealist writer Georges Bataille. As Bjork once explained in Dazed &amp; Confused, Bataille's novel ''The Story of the Eye'' ''is basically about a couple that go on a mission against morality and against perceived ways of behavior, and basically take it to the extreme and show that if you want to do it, you should.''</p>
