        <p>''Made for America (Part 1),'' the summer show at the Howard Greenberg Gallery in SoHo, included the work of photography giants like Margaret Bourke-White, Edward Steichen, Robert Capa, Edward Weston and Robert Frank. All the images were vintage prints from the Time Inc. picture collection, many taken for publication in Fortune or Life, and all were for sale at prices ranging from $1,500 to $65,000.</p>
        <p>Like the recent offerings at auction and in galleries of vintage prints from the picture archives of The New York Times and The Daily News, the show raised a provocative issue: does it matter that newspapers and magazines are selling the original prints from their archives?</p>
        <p>Vintage prints -- photographs made shortly after the images were taken -- are highly prized in today's photography market. Age, superior photographic paper and superior printing technique combine to give them a special glow. Even signs of handling, like crop marks, add to their value.</p>
        <p>Advocates of the sales argue that today's technology allows the digital storage of images, making the hard copies, or prints, superfluous. Digitizing and maintaining picture collections cost money, they say, which the sales will help defray. Furthermore, these proponents observe, because newspapers are in the business of news gathering and are not curators, the valuable old prints are better off going to collectors and museum professionals, who know how to care for them.</p>
        <p>But to critics of such sales, what is at stake is history itself. Newspapers and magazines can make any number of prints from their negatives, they say, but a new print, however well made, will lack the palimpsest of the past. The front of a vintage print often shows the wear and tear of use. Its back is usually a patchwork of markings: dated stamps recording each publication, notations by the photographer or editor handling the print, captions written by hand or taped or pasted on.</p>
        <p>''Late last year,'' said Eric Meskauskas, director of photography at The Daily News in New York, ''there were some heated arguments within the paper about selling off history.''</p>
        <p>Fred Ritchin, associate professor of photography and communications at New York University and director of Pixelpress, which creates documentary-photography Web sites, questions the idea that scanned images make the original old prints superfluous.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that happened in analog media, such as prints, is that they evolve over time,'' he said. ''They turn yellow, they turn brown, whereas scans never change. So that, in a sense, history is frozen. You can argue that you can scan an ancient manuscript, but no one will argue that it's the same as having the ancient manuscript.''</p>
        <p>In an informal survey of about 20 of the oldest newspapers in the country, most --  including The San Francisco Chronicle, The Los Angeles Times, The Denver Post, The Miami Herald, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Boston Globe, The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Washington Post -- have no plans to sell their original prints. Only The Chicago Tribune and The Record of Hackensack, N.J., said they were contemplating such sales.</p>
        <p>Still, just as many newspapers no longer keep original copies of their issues, preferring the less-space-consuming microfilm, it is probably only a matter of time before technology and commerce conspire to make newspaper collections of old prints a thing of the past.</p>
        <p>For their part Beth Iskander, director of photography for Time Inc. editorial services, Mr. Meskauskas of The Daily News and Nancy Lee, director of business development for the news services division of The New York Times, contend that letting go of their vintage prints is desirable.</p>
        <p>Asked if these sales meant selling history, Ms. Iskander responded: ''What's important: the image itself or the piece of paper? The image is not going away.''</p>
        <p>Sales of Time Inc.'s vintage prints, Ms. Iskander said, would defray the cost of maintaining a collection of about 22 million photographs. (She declined to give the sales figures for the recent show at Howard Greenberg.) ''We are selling the artifact, not the copyright,'' she said. Before the vintage prints are offered for sale, she said, ''we make high-resolution digital scans.''</p>
        <p>''If we have the negatives,'' she added, ''we make prints. If we don't, we make copy negatives and prints.'' Therefore the sales do not shrink the number of images in the collection.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meskauskas also believes, he said, ''that the image itself is the history, not the vintage print.''</p>
        <p>Two million images in the Daily News picture library have been digitized. (They can be viewed at www.dailynewspix.com.) ''We have a wonderful history of New York in our photo archive,'' Mr. Meskauskas said. ''We need to raise the profile of our archive, and one way to do it is through auctions, gifts, exhibitions and books.''</p>
        <p>''New York Noir: Crime Photographs From The Daily News Archive,'' a traveling museum exhibition, includes many vintage prints. They would probably be sold afterward, Mr. Meskauskas said, as ''there's a lot of interest in those photographs.'' His newspaper began selling vintage photographs earlier this year, offering them at a New York gallery, at a Sotheby's photography auction and on sothebys.amazon.com. A  sale of 74 of the paper's vintage prints, ''Above and Below New York,'' is on sothebys.amazon.com, with bidding open through tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The New York Times began digitizing the five million prints in its archive in 1996. To commemorate The Times's centennial that year, 300 photographs from the newspaper's archive, including many vintage prints, were given to the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>Because The Times is a newspaper and the prints are used for reproduction, Ms. Lee said, ''what we need is a robust database, a digital archive, more than we do a print archive.''</p>
        <p>With the publication of the book ''The Century in Times Square'' last October, The Times began exhibiting Times Square-related photographs from its archive at galleries around the country. At each of the traveling exhibitions, the newspaper has offered vintage prints for sale; so far 10 have been sold for a total of about $36,000.</p>
        <p>Given the current value of these prints, it seems almost inconceivable that they were once routinely discarded at many newspapers because there was no room for them.</p>
        <p>The Times's culling was systematic and extensive. Fred Keller, whose tenure at the newspaper's picture library began around 1960 and who is now the library's supervisor, recalled that for two years in the late 1970's a retired Associated Press picture editor was hired to go through the more than 14,000 subject folders, discarding duplicates, unpublished pictures and news agency photographs.</p>
        <p>Throughout the 80's, Mr. Keller said, ''whenever a drawer got tight, we weeded that drawer. Nobody could order cabinets.''</p>
        <p>In the 1990's, though, Ms. Lee said, The Times started ''a process whereby the whole archive is taken care of in a much better way.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Iskander said that curatorial editing of the Time Inc. picture archive started in 1978, when the photography market was beginning to heat up. Doris O'Neil, then the director of the photographic collection, and the photography dealer Lee Witkin separated from the files photographs they deemed to have artistic merit. About 30,000 images, mainly from Life, and some from Fortune, were removed from circulation to prevent further damage. Vintage photographs offered for sale are drawn from this collection.</p>
        <p>Of the 90 Time Inc. photographs on view at the Howard Greenberg Gallery, 26 were by Bourke-White. Ten of the images were by Capa, including one of the famously blurred pictures of soldiers struggling ashore at Normandy during the D-Day invasion in 1944. A 1951 Frank work, a sequence of five pictures of a couple under an umbrella in the Tuileries, shows that before he was infected by the mystery and sadness of America, he was in the thrall of dreamy, romantic Paris.</p>
        <p>For commercial galleries and museums alike, what is compelling about old news prints is the historical information they offer. Mr. Meskauskas had reservations when he and his colleagues first discussed with dealers and auction houses the possibility of selling vintage prints from The Daily News archive. ''I was convinced they would not be interested because most of our prints, like most newspaper prints, have various marks: retouching marks, crop marks, various annotations on the back,'' he said. ''They are pictures used on a day-to-day basis, not meant as art.''</p>
        <p>But when the photography experts saw the authentication marks, he added, ''they loved them.''</p>
        <p>Jim Mones, director of The New York Times Photo Archives, likened the markings to the stamps on a passport. He said that collectors get part of the newspaper's history as well as the vintage prints.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg is sanguine about his role in selling vintage prints for Time Inc. ''Short of creating their own museums, which I thought would be the best way of dealing with the vintage prints, short of that, we're doing the next best thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The condition of many of the Time Inc. prints on view at Mr. Greenberg's gallery attest to a well-founded concern.</p>
        <p>Framed and behind glass, the prints seemed fine when viewed head-on. But seen  from the side or below, they revealed creases, dents, bumped corners. A delightful 1942 print of Betty Grable in a classic World War II pinup pose turned out to be crinkly from edge to edge, as if it had passed through a million hands, even though the marks on the reverse side showed that it had been published perhaps a half-dozen times.</p>
        <p>Digitized, the Grable image is pristine and can be reproduced endlessly, with no harm to the original. But what is lost is an object that, like all vintage prints, has acquired a life of its own over the years.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 25, 2000, Monday  An article last Monday about newspapers' sales of vintage photographic prints misidentified the event commemorated by The New York Times in 1996. It was the centennial of Adolph S. Ochs's purchase of the newspaper; The Times's founding occurred in 1851.</p>
