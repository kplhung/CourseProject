        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton had just finished holding a news conference at an Upper West Side park in Manhattan the other morning and, with a glance at the rather large audience in front of her -- reporters, Secret Service agents, aides, even a few citizens who had found their way past the security ropes -- she burst forth with an invitation:</p>

        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton had just finished holding a news conference at an Upper West Side park in Manhattan the other morning and, with a glance at the rather large audience in front of her -- reporters, Secret Service agents, aides, even a few citizens who had found their way past the security ropes -- she burst forth with an invitation:</p>
        <p>''Come on, guys, let's go get some coffee!'' she said.</p>
        <p>And so the first lady of the United States led the bustling clump of people along a stone path to an empty outdoor restaurant at the 79th Street boat basin, chattering at every step of the way. ''How's your daughter?'' Mrs. Clinton asked a radio reporter. She invited fellow strollers to join her in a song. She sought out passers-by walking dogs. When she got to the restaurant, she summoned everyone to join her at her table, amid the cameras, boom mikes and men in suits with guns.</p>
        <p>Hillary Clinton's permitting herself to be part of such an uncontrolled environment would have been inconceivable when she came to New York as a candidate 15 months ago. At the start of her journey from the protection of the White House to the exposure of being a candidate, Mrs. Clinton was cloistered and choreographed. She went weeks without uttering anything that might be taken as even vaguely daring, and scurried from all but the least threatening campaign situations.</p>
        <p>But on this bright and sunny September morning, Mrs. Clinton spent 30 minutes making small talk with the restaurant manager, and confidently if vaguely answering questions from reporters. It was all a little awkward and a little forced, but still, she was as cheery and chirpy as a camp counselor.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton has come quite a distance since the often tense and scripted-to-the-minute days of her listening tour last year. She is much more likely to linger to shake a hand, as she has observed her husband do for 20 years. She is comfortable giving a campaign stump speech and taking questions from voters and reporters, and she shows a flash of the knife when attacking her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, though not quite as much as some of her advisers might like.</p>
        <p>Yet for all her efforts to portray herself as a happy campaigner -- the presumably spontaneous display at the boat basin came when Mrs. Clinton had expected renewed examination of her political skills -- the first lady enters the last two months of this campaign still, in many ways, a distant and enigmatic public figure.</p>
        <p>If she is easy in some settings, as when she strolled happily through an energetic crowd at a fair in Chappaqua, N.Y., Saturday afternoon, her eyes shaded by metallic-blue tinted sunglasses, she can be tense and stiff in more formal campaign settings.</p>
        <p>In the debate last week, for example, Mrs. Clinton came across, in the view of one Democratic county chairman, as a tense and cheerless lawyer. That is precisely the kind of perception her advisers have been battling to erase.</p>
        <p>And the debate was not an aberration. Her speeches, like the one she gave at the Democratic National Convention in August, tend to be delivered in the flat accent of the Midwest, where she grew up, with her voice modulating between two tones.  It is not uncommon at Mrs. Clinton's formal speeches to hear the rustle of conversation rising from the back of the hall before the first lady reaches the last page.</p>
        <p>And that is the essential complication of the first lady as candidate. Mrs. Clinton's political advisers like to argue that many voters who meet her walk away remarking that she is,  expectations to the contrary, a warm and genial person. But that very reaction is in its own way damning: evidence that her public perception remains, for many New Yorkers, the cool and aloof president's wife.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who has been repeatedly urged by her husband to come across as enjoying the daily grind of the campaign, said in an interview that for all the difficulty she has experienced in the last year, she believes that she is entering the final part of her campaign a relaxed and confident candidate, albeit one running for office for the first time.</p>
        <p>''When I started, I didn't know what to expect,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I'd been around for campaigns for about 40 years, but I had never done it myself. I didn't know if I would be good at it, and I didn't know if I would like doing it. I really like it.''</p>
        <p>Still, the first lady says that she has found campaigning for herself more difficult and complicated than she ever expected. She said her experience campaigning on behalf of other candidates, which is how she spent much of her first seven years in White House, had not prepared her for life as a candidate in New York.</p>
        <p>''I had never understood how different it was to step across the line from supporting a surrogate to being an actual candidate,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''Maybe that sounds strange. But all of a sudden, you're the person who is answering the questions. I'm not speaking on behalf of Bill Clinton and Chuck Schumer or Al Gore. I'm speaking on behalf of myself.</p>
        <p>''I've often said to myself, 'Of all the free advice that I willfully dispense to people, I'd like to take some of it back.' It's a lot harder than it looks.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's friends say she was not prepared for the extent to which any phrase that she uttered could be turned against her as a candidate, since that did not happen when, for example, she campaigned on behalf of Charles E. Schumer in the 1998 race for Senate. ''People are always looking for a way to distort or take out of context,'' she said. ''Especially in this campaign, where everybody knows there's a lot at stake.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton is surely not the first candidate to have made that discovery, but friends say she found it unnerving, and it served to reinforce what has always been a dominant trait: her sense of caution. And while she is not as muted as she once was, Mrs. Clinton today is still able to speak for hours without saying a sentence that finds its way to the television news or into a newspaper.</p>
        <p>There is, without question, an element of calculation in Mrs. Clinton's recent attempt to present herself as someone who finds joy on the campaign trail. A friend of the Clintons said that, in a political twist on the a-dog-can-smell-fear theory, Mr. Clinton told his wife that voters note when candidates appear to be enjoying themselves on the campaign trail -- advice presumably offered because, at first, Mrs. Clinton did seem somewhat joyless.</p>
        <p>That is no longer the case, at least for public consumption. Yesterday, as she campaigned in Queens at black churches, which have always seemed to energize Mrs. Clinton, she danced with the choirs at two of them, waded into almost every crowd she saw, and even greeted parishioners with the very un-first-lady-like salutation, ''Rock on!''</p>
        <p>Her personality aside, Mrs. Clinton has encountered other obstacles. Celebrity surely has its benefits, but the first lady campaigns through a blanket of reporters and Secret Service protection, which tends to complicate nearly everything she does.</p>
        <p>At her Upper West Side news conference, ropes and security details kept the candidate at a fixed distance from the press, and pedestrians were forced to detour off the path so as not to come anywhere near the woman who was seeking to become their senator. When she visited a church in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, recently, a Secret Service agent, watching reporters line up for what for most candidates would be a routine news conference, suddenly shouted: ''Don't circle her. If you circle her like that, I'm going to take her right in.''</p>
        <p>Finally, Mrs. Clinton has the same problem that Al Gore does, which is that, inevitably if unfairly, her campaigning skills are judged against the standard set by President Clinton. ''I've watched him over the years,'' she said, ''and he gets an enormous amount of enjoyment out of it. He loves meeting people, and the experience of being in crowds. And I find it to be very exciting and interesting, and even touching.''</p>
        <p>Still, differences remain. A few weeks ago, the Clintons attended the State Fair in Syracuse, where thousands of people turned out to see a sitting president and first lady. Both Clintons joyfully took off shaking hands, Mr. Clinton on one side of the road, Mrs. Clinton on the other, and they kept at it for hours.</p>
        <p>As it grew late, Mr. Clinton was still shaking hands, stopping to talk and listen, bursting with energy. Off to the side, not 10 feet away, Mrs. Clinton was done for the day. She stood alone, arms folded, waiting for him to join her in the motorcade.</p>
