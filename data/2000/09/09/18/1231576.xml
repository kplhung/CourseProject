        <p>The presidential candidates and the voters are now happily engaged in an orgy of self-congratulation for finally touching the third rail of American politics, Social Security and Medicare. We are told that we are confronting the hard choices that others less courageous have been unwilling to make.</p>
        <p>The melancholy truth is that what poses for debate on entitlements may be worse than no debate at all. The bidding and one-upmanship on the campaign trail could easily lock the new president into indefensible positions that block genuine and badly needed reforms.</p>
        <p>Instead of hard and honest choices, we are being presented with a rich menu of free lunches; to be politically correct these days is only to speak of the politically pleasant. In the abstract, who could argue against adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and beefing up Social Security benefits for working mothers and widows? As to some privatization of Social Security, who wouldn't want the chance to receive higher returns through personal retirement accounts, particularly if it involved no new contributions?</p>
        <p>The only thing not discussed is what we would give up to get these new goodies. Apparently, these great economic times will go on as far as the eye can see. We can afford anything and cut taxes substantially to boot.</p>
        <p>But the hard choices are neither abstract nor avoidable. Existing benefit programs are, by any reasonable definition, already unaffordable and unsustainable.</p>
        <p>Take Social Security. Over the next 75 years, the real deficit is projected to be about $21 trillion, in inflation-adjusted dollars. But at least when it comes to Social Security, there are gradual and, yes, humane proposals available, like gradually increasing the eligibility age for full benefits and progressively reducing benefits for those whose incomes are above the median.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I have yet to see a proposal for Medicare reform that truly confronts the magnitude of what looms ahead. Even before adding a prescription drug benefit, Medicare Part A, which covers hospital bills, is facing a deficit of $12 trillion over the next 75 years. Trillions more will be needed to finance Part B, which covers doctor bills, home health services and other outpatient costs.</p>
        <p>I believe reform will involve painful moral as well as political decisions. The nation is in love with high-cost, high-tech medicine, but as our population ages dramatically, how will we decide who gets what health care? No one dares to discuss rationing, the most toxic but inevitable of all subjects. These difficulties are one more reason we should hold back on tax cuts until we have, at the very least, genuinely reformed Social Security.</p>
        <p>Already, we spend a disproportionate amount on senior citizens. A recent study by the Congressional Budget Office shows that spending on the elderly towers seven-to-one over spending on children. Overall, spending on seniors consumes 35 percent of the budget -- up from just 16 percent in 1965.</p>
        <p>And the baby boomers haven't even retired yet. By 2050, according to White House projections, the major benefit programs for older Americans will consume an incredible 84 percent of budget outlays.</p>
        <p>From 2010 to 2030, the cost of Social Security and Medicare is projected to rise, from 15 percent of a worker's taxable earnings to 28 percent or more. The burden would fall heavily on the middle class, the very group to which politicians are always promising tax cuts. And remember, the taxpayers stuck with these increases will be our children and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Why is there so little understanding of the long-term challenge? Two big myths are anesthetizing our judgment:</p>
        <p>Myth No. 1: Social Security is in good shape because it has a trust fund. We are often told that the trust fund will keep the system solvent until 2037 if we do nothing and, if we make some minor tweaks, it will last until 2075. Who could get excited over such a distant danger?</p>
        <p>What we are rarely told is that the trust fund is fiscally and economically meaningless, an accounting fiction; this money has already been spent. Its so-called assets are nothing but a stack of i.o.u.'s from the Treasury. By 2015, Social Security's annual costs will start to exceed its tax revenues by ever ballooning margins.</p>
        <p>Because this is a pay-as-you-go system, Congress would then have to raise taxes, cut other spending or borrow from the public to redeem the i.o.u.'s -- precisely as if there were no trust fund -- or else take a heavy hatchet to Social Security and Medicare at the very moment the huge boomer generation is moving into its elder years.</p>
        <p>Some argue that we can use the projected budget surpluses to pay off the i.o.u.'s. Alas, this isn't possible. The surpluses themselves may not materialize. For one thing, an economic downturn could easily turn the surpluses into deficits in just a few years. For another, the budget projections assume, implausibly, that discretionary spending will not grow faster than inflation -- in spite of major new commitments to defense and education.</p>
        <p>If the surpluses do materialize, much of the money is likely to be spent. Gluttons don't often turn down a free lunch. Presidential candidates and members of Congress rarely withstand the temptation to give away surpluses by increasing spending or cutting taxes.</p>
        <p>There's much talk of putting a ''lock box'' on the surpluses. But no one has yet designed a lock box that Congress couldn't pick. Even if the lock box works, the money in the trust fund is but a small down payment on future obligations.</p>
        <p>Myth No. 2: The New Economy will allow us to grow our way out of the problem. According to this myth, official projections, which point to a gradual slowdown in economic growth, are too pessimistic.</p>
        <p>The critics confuse pessimism with arithmetic. Economic growth depends not just on growth in productivity, that is, output per worker, but also on rising numbers of workers. By the 2020's, the labor force will be growing only about one-tenth as fast as in the last quarter century. Given the demographics, it would fly against all logic if economic growth did not slow.</p>
        <p>A better question is whether the official projections are too pessimistic about the growth in productivity. But keep in mind that even a huge boost in productivity won't do much to reduce Social Security's burden. According to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, eliminating Social Security's long-term deficit would require a 200 percent increase in long-term productivity, a leap that few economists, even new economy enthusiasts, believe is possible.</p>
        <p>Our leaders face a choice. They can address the question of entitlements for the elderly while the economy is still booming and the budget is in the black, and before most baby boomers retire. Or they can delay until the window of opportunity closes. Either way, America will change course. If we act now, everyone, young and old, will have time to adjust and prepare.</p>
        <p>The candidates and the voters must decide what we are willing to sacrifice today to preserve the American dream for our children and grandchildren. As the song goes, ''Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.''</p>
