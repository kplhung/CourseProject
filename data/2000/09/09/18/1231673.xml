        <p>The week of practice for Giants defensive players leading to the Chicago game was a physical one. There was extra hitting, and the shoulder pads stayed on a tad longer. The Bears had lost twice, but the Giants weren't taking any chances. ''Some of the drills were rough,'' said defensive lineman Michael Strahan, who then flashed his bright smile before adding, ''It was good for us.''</p>
        <p>The classroom periods were equally intense. As usual, the defensive coordinator John Fox and his staff had his players so prepared that they knew what Bears quarterback Cade McNown ate for lunch last Thursday. They also knew one of his favorite plays. Fox told his players that when the Bears had three wide receivers to one side and a back in the backfield close to McNown, that usually was the prelude to a McNown draw play. Chicago had hurt other defenses using it, so they should count on seeing it at least a few times.</p>
        <p>It didn't take long for Fox's prediction to come true. In the first quarter, McNown attempted the draw and was stuffed. Later in the game, the Bears tried to trick the Giants, because while running out of the same formation, McNown handed off to running back Curtis Enis instead of keeping it himself. No matter. Stuffed anyway.</p>
        <p>The extra preparation paid off handsomely, because this week, the Giants' high-scoring offense fizzled, and still the Giants beat Chicago, 14-7. And in an unusual twist, the game was won by the defense, in one of those old-fashioned, jaw-busting contests in which Strahan, linebacker Jessie Armstead and defensive lineman Keith Hamilton completely dominated the Bears.</p>
        <p>''I would say our offense won the first two games,'' said Strahan, who is in Pro Bowl form, ''so we owed them.''</p>
        <p>It is a good omen. No team, except maybe the St. Louis Rams, can win in one dimension, with the offense putting up 25 or 30 points and the defense playing average. What the Giants showed against Chicago was that when needed, the defense can be just as overwhelming as the offense.</p>
        <p>What Giants players to the man were all saying is that only a few years ago, this is a game the team would have lost. The Giants were horrid yesterday on special teams, missing one field-goal attempt and having two others blocked. The score was tied at 7-7 in the first half when it should have been at least 17-0. ''In the past we would have thought: 'Oh, no, a blocked field goal. Here we go,' '' Strahan said.</p>
        <p>The Giants even survived a late fumble by running back Tiki Barber, one of the few mistakes the star back has made this season.</p>
        <p>But New York's defense hardened, showing the kind of toughness a Giants defense hasn't since 1993, when Lawrence Taylor was still playing instead of acting in the movies. In the second half, McNown was only 8 of 17 for 64 yards. He was sacked four times, once each by Strahan, Armstead, Hamilton and linebacker Michael Barrow. Those are the players Fox wants to make the big plays.</p>
        <p>Fox threw everything at McNown. Cornerback Jason Sehorn blitzed McNown from the corner, sending him to the ground just as he got a  pass off. Chicago was rarely able to sustain a drive, and Enis, the first-round pick from Penn State in 1998, had as much impact as a ripple of water on Lake Michigan. He had just five carries for 13 yards.</p>
        <p>The Giants' defense even goaded the Bears into committing a critical penalty midway through the last quarter when wide receiver Eddie Kennison head-butted defensive back Dave Thomas on the sideline after Thomas first pushed him. It was a 15-yard penalty and ended any realistic chance the Bears had at tying the game.</p>
        <p>When Brad Daluiso's 31-yard field-goal attempt was blocked with just over one minute left, the Bears got the ball back at their 20-yard line.</p>
        <p>In the defensive huddle, Giants players said to one another, in rather colorful language, the defense was going to win the game and stop Chicago. The Bears didn't come close to sending the game into overtime. McNown was under pressure on each pass, and his last attempt fell incomplete with 19 seconds left.</p>
        <p>The Giants' locker room is a completely different place from what it was last year. The team was divided, much more so than was publicly known. The defense was angry with the offense, and the offense was tired of the defense constantly reminding it how bad it was playing.</p>
        <p>Now there is lots of love. If the Giants are any more positive the locker room will turn into Woodstock.</p>
        <p>The Giants are 3-0. Unless there is a bizarre collapse, they will make the playoffs, and while the offense will get most of the headlines, the defense will also be a serious force.</p>
        <p>They're back.</p>
        <p>Minus the bickering.</p>
        <p>''We're only going to get better,'' Armstead said.</p>
        <p>Believe it.</p>
