        <p>When voters here upended a 7-to-0 Republican town board last fall in favor of a 5-to-2 Democratic majority, they hoped to break a cycle of corruption and scandal epitomized by William L. Paroli Sr., the jailed former chairman of the local and Dutchess County Republican parties.</p>
        <p>But so far, the only thing that has come close to being broken is the wrist of a Democratic councilwoman, which was severely sprained after a scuffle last month with the town supervisor, another Democrat.</p>
        <p>Far from transforming government from a pariah into a paragon, town officials have instead turned politics into a schoolyard rumble that sometimes could be likened to a Beckett play as interpreted by Monty Python. Officials are suing one another for bad behavior and calling each other nasty names. Rancorous meetings are filled with nonstop gavel-pounding debates over who really knows Robert's Rules of Order and why the supervisor does not open the mail more quickly.</p>
        <p>''It's like, 'Let's go to the town board meeting; it's more exciting than Monday night wrestling,' '' Robert Legacy, a resident, said at a recent town board meeting.</p>
        <p>Now this beleaguered town of 41,000 people, the largest in Dutchess County, is bracing for even more turbulence and theatrics.  Last week, in an unprecedented act that was tantamount to a suburban coup, the board voted to hold a referendum in November on whether to strip the supervisor, Ann Barcher, of her powers and create a board-appointed town administrator position.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barcher says the referendum is a personal attack; the board says it is not. But either way, residents here are learning lessons about what happens when local government breaks down and how the transition from a checkered past can be more easily desired than achieved.</p>
        <p>''We're a laughingstock,'' said Gordon Weiss, the town's deputy supervisor. ''I think people look at us as a bunch of buffoons. I personally think it would make a great movie, but it's so bizarre that you'd think I was paranoid crazy and out to lunch.''</p>
        <p>Actually, the movie would have to be a sequel, because life here was bizarre even before the board endorsed junking the current form of government.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, when federal authorities began investigating local corruption, they questioned many allies of Mr. Paroli, the Republican behind-the-scenes boss who resembles an upstate Marlon Brando. One of the allies, Basil Raucci, the former assessor, was found drowned in the Hudson River in 1997 shortly after being questioned. Meanwhile, Fred Andros, the former water superintendent, pleaded guilty to corruption charges last year and was accused of  masterminding a murder involving two women he had videotaped having sex.</p>
        <p>Five people have been convicted of or have pleaded guilty to federal charges -- including Mr. Paroli, 72, who began a 21-month sentence this summer for forcing developers to pay him and the local Republican Party more than $100,000 in exchange for permits and tax breaks. As a result, the normally weak Democrats wrested power by portraying themselves as an anti-Paroli party of integrity.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people have known for a lot of years that he was running the town,'' said Dick Buckey, a retired I.B.M. employee who was one of the freshman Democrats who won two-year terms. ''In the beginning, I think that we all had an outlook that we were really going to turn the town around.''</p>
        <p>But the honeymoon never happened. From the outset last fall, the six new council members clashed with the new supervisor, Ms. Barcher, over nearly every personnel decision. The supervisor further alienated the board by calling the police to kick them out of her office and dissolving several committees. But at least the town attorney, James Coombs, is back at work after being charged with drunken driving and leaving the scene of an accident this summer. (He has not yet appeared in court, officials said.)</p>
        <p>The bickering has sapped morale and paralyzed town business to the point where grant applications and budget deadlines run the risk of being botched or missed.</p>
        <p>''They're not bad people,'' said James E. O'Shea, the town's Republican Party chairman, adding that he was not gloating. ''They're just completely inept.''</p>
        <p>The verbal sparring and a series of 6-to-1 votes with Ms. Barcher in the minority, were just a prelude to the wrestling match in Ms. Barcher's office last month between her and Marlene Galow, a Democratic councilwoman.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Galow accused Ms. Barcher of stealing a computer from the assessor's office; Ms. Barcher said she had taken it to examine it for her own corruption investigation. Mrs. Galow said that Ms. Barcher threw her against the wall while screaming obscenities; Ms. Barcher said Mrs. Galow provoked the confrontation. Mrs. Galow suffered a severe wrist sprain and was fitted for a cast; Ms. Barcher cited a sore back and arm.</p>
        <p>Each had the other arrested, and each is scheduled to be arraigned later this month.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the fight, Ms. Barcher filed another complaint against Mrs. Galow claiming that she had threatened to kill her and assaulted her with a purse during a Democratic meeting in December.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Galow referred all questions to her lawyer, Wayne Thatcher, who called Ms. Barcher's version of events ''ludicrously silly.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Barcher, naturally, had a different view. ''I'm 52 -- I'm out of shape,'' she said. ''I would be so happy if I were physically capable of throwing someone against the wall.''</p>
        <p>The real question, Ms. Barcher said, is why Mrs. Galow was so rattled by a computer. She volunteered her theory, that Mrs. Galow and other board members may be ''Paroli Democrats'' who are corrupt or beholden to special interests.</p>
        <p>''Dealing with these crazy, parochial-minded people is very difficult,'' said Ms. Barcher, an immigration lawyer who occasionally reminds the board about her Harvard degree and New York City background during meetings. ''I think New York is a lot saner in many respects.''</p>
        <p>For the board -- now 6-to-1 Democratic after Art Brown, a Republican left moved out of town and was replaced by Theresa Brown (no relation) -- Ms. Barcher's anti-corruption zeal has hampered her ability to govern. In August, two Democratic councilmen, Mr. Buckey and James Challey, who teaches physics at Vassar, proposed hiring an administrator and gutting most of the supervisor's powers.</p>
        <p>''Our feeling is that it really can't get any worse,'' said Mr. Challey of the government's polarization.</p>
        <p>During a recent meeting, most residents accused the board of a hasty power grab, while the board members insisted that the idea had originated before Ms. Barcher's tenure. Many residents also complained that the costs of the proposed change had not been thoroughly researched. After a four-hour meeting, the board, as expected, approved the referendum with only one person voting no: Ms. Barcher.</p>
        <p>The town's wrangling has left a bad impression. In the adjacent city of Poughkeepsie, people have fervently tried to distance themselves from their dysfunctional neighbor.</p>
        <p>''I really appreciate the fact that you are separating the city from the town,'' said Colette Lafuente, the city's Republican mayor. ''I've had people come up to me and say did I get into fights. And the answer of course is 'no!' We work hard here to not do that kind of thing.''</p>
