        <p>Richard B. Thomas, a former publisher of Time magazine who helped start People magazine, died Thursday at his home in Old Greenwich, Conn. He was 69.</p>
        <p>The cause was cancer, said his son, Charles B. Thomas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas was part of the last generation of Time Inc. executives to work with Henry Luce, the company's legendary co-founder.</p>
        <p>''He was a dyed-in-the-wool Time Inc. executive,'' his son said. ''He went straight from the Marines to Time. It formed who he was and the relationships he had.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas, who was born in Middletown, Conn., graduated from Dartmouth College in 1953 and then served two years in the Marines.</p>
        <p>He worked for Time Inc. for 31 years and was the first advertising director for Money magazine. He retired in 1988 as the publisher of Time magazine.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Thomas's ''magical period'' at the company came when he worked as the first advertising director of the fledgling People magazine in the mid-1970's, his son said. People was an unusual offering for a company that, at the time, was known for male-oriented publications like Fortune and Sports Illustrated.</p>
        <p>''It was unique, personality journalism,'' said Edward McCarrick, the current publisher of Time magazine, who once worked for Mr. Thomas. People is now ''by far one of Time Inc.'s most successful publications,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas is survived by his wife of 45 years, Priscilla P. Thomas; a daughter, Amy T. Freyre of New Canaan, Conn.; four sons, Charles of Dallas, Richard of Winnetka, Ill., Douglas of Wilmet, Ill., and Peter of Minneapolis; and 17 grandchildren.</p>
