        <p>Defenseman Garry Galley discusses signing with New York Islanders (S)</p>

        <p>The last box from the move from Los Angeles had been unloaded only a day when the telephone rang in Garry Galley's rented home in Ottawa. On the other end was Islanders General Manager Mike Milbury, who asked: Want to come play in New York?</p>
        <p>Galley's answer, after several days of discussion with his newly uprooted family, was yes, and yesterday, the 37-year-old defenseman who had been about ready to retire skated for the first time with his new teammates.</p>
        <p>''After I turned down the offer in Los Angeles, I was aware that sitting out the season was a definite possibility, and I was going to start settling into the second part of my life,'' said Galley, who signed a one-year deal worth $850,000 with a $1.1 million team option on Sept. 13. The question was not about my playing, but about how moving again would affect my family.</p>
        <p>Galley, who has played with the Kings, Boston, Philadelphia and Buffalo during 16 years in the National Hockey League, is joining an Islanders defense that has undergone a complete change from last year's kiddie corps with the acquisition of the two-time All-Star Roman Hamrlik and the veteran Kevin Haller.</p>
        <p>The team made a number of roster moves yesterday, sending Mike D'Alessandro, Marco Charpentier, Mike Rice, Justin Mapletoft and Adam Johnson back to juniors and Dmitri Upper back to Russia. It also reassigned Peter Mika to Lowell, Trent Hunter to Springfield and Dan Trebil to Chicago.</p>
