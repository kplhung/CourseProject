        <p>Allied Domecq, the British beverage conglomerate, has discussed teaming up with Vin and Sprit, the Swedish company that owns Absolut vodka, to bid for the wine and spirits business of Seagram, people close to the talks said today.</p>
        <p>For Allied, such a pairing would lock in the Absolut brand, which is estimated to account for $75 million to $100 million in annual profit for Seagram. Seagram has controlled the global distribution rights to Absolut vodka since 1994, but Vin and Sprit is using the sale of Seagram to Vivendi of France as an opportunity to secure a better deal, which could include an ownership stake. Seagram has said it would dispose of its wine and spirits business as part of its deal with Vivendi, which would use the $9 billion or so from such a sale to pay down debt.</p>

        <p>Allied Domecq, the British beverage conglomerate, has discussed teaming up with Vin and Sprit, the Swedish company that owns Absolut vodka, to bid for the wine and spirits business of Seagram, people close to the talks said today.</p>
        <p>For Allied, such a pairing would lock in the Absolut brand, which is estimated to account for $75 million to $100 million in annual profit for Seagram. Seagram has controlled the global distribution rights to Absolut vodka since 1994, but Vin and Sprit is using the sale of Seagram to Vivendi of France as an opportunity to secure a better deal, which could include an ownership stake. Seagram has said it would dispose of its wine and spirits business as part of its deal with Vivendi, which would use the $9 billion or so from such a sale to pay down debt.</p>
        <p>''Vin and Sprit doesn't want to be in this position again, where someone decides to sell a business and carve it up,'' an executive close to the discussions said. ''They would like to get more control, either through ownership or some ironclad rights agreement.''</p>
        <p>An Allied Domecq spokeswoman, Jane Mussared, declined to speak specifically about discussions the company has held with Vin and Sprit, saying, ''We are talking to all the usual parties.'' A Vin and Sprit executive was not immediately available for comment.</p>
        <p>Allied is one of the few companies with the financial strength and the regulatory leeway to bid alone for Seagram's liquor business, and it is not ruling out that possibility, a person close to the company said. But securing the backing of Vin and Sprit is seen as crucial to retaining the Absolut brand.</p>
        <p>Allied's main competitor, Diageo, also of Britain, is teaming up with Pernod Ricard of France to bid for Seagram's wine and spirits empire, which includes brands like Chivas Regal Scotch and Captain Morgan's rum. If successful, the companies would then split the business along lines that would allow Diageo, the largest liquor company by volume, to sidestep antitrust objections.</p>
