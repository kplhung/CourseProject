        <p>JENNY THOMPSON'S lip quivered last night as she held back the tears. Once again the 27-year-old American swimmer had been thwarted in her quest to win the individual Olympic gold medal that had eluded her so long.</p>
        <p>In a pool crackling with world records, the powerful Inge de Bruijn of the Netherlands broke her own world record in the 100-meter butterfly last night by winning in 56.61 seconds. Thompson finished fifth in 58.73.</p>
        <p>After the race, the American walked past a news media horde to go to the warm-up pool to cool down and to put the loss in perspective.</p>
        <p>Now back before the news media, composed but saddened, Thompson attempted to put her finger on what went wrong.</p>
        <p>''I was going in it to win it, and I think I tried a little too hard,'' Thompson said. ''I felt good; I felt confident before the race. I went for it. I just tightened up in the end. I have to admit that I'm disappointed. I gave the best that I had.''</p>
        <p>A day earlier, Thompson had been ecstatic. She had became the first American woman to win six Olympic gold medals, after anchoring a United States women's 4x100 freestyle relay that set a world record of 3:36.61. Thompson joined 33-year-old Dara Torres to become the first American female swimmers to win three golds in the same event. Thompson's golds came in 1992 and 1996.</p>
        <p>Yet she desperately wanted to finish her career -- if this is the end of it -- with an individual gold.</p>
        <p>By the last 10 meters of last night's race, Thompson was spent. Not only did she not win the gold, but did not win silver or bronze, either. Third place went to Torres, who won her first individual Olympic medal.</p>
        <p>''Jenny made the choice before the race started to try to win the gold medal,'' said Richard Quick, the United States swimming coach and Thompson's personal coach. ''She wasn't striving for silver or bronze. In order to do that she went out very fast, thinking the way to beat Inge was to put pressure on her.''</p>
        <p>Thompson was asked about the end of the race when she appeared to fade as de Bruijn stepped on the reserve that superstars call on to separate themselves from the field. Michael Jordan had it, Tiger Woods has it, Ian Thorpe is getting it.</p>
        <p>Everyone else does the best he or she can.</p>
        <p>''The last 10 meters, I was really struggling,'' Thompson said.</p>
        <p>Thompson might not have beaten de Bruijn last night, but she did push her. Thompson was responsible in a large way for de Bruijn's world record -- playing the role of a one-woman rhythm section -- driving, pushing. Thompson's speed didn't allow de Bruin to ease into the race but forced her to jump right into third gear -- which she did.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Thompson was done in by her own strategy. ''There's nothing more I could have done,'' she said. ''I went in with a positive attitude; I went for it.</p>
        <p>''I just couldn't -- I was just trying too hard; I just had too much heart in it and the emotion just tightened me up.''</p>
        <p>There is another opportunity for  Thompson. Her final chance will come here Thursday night, when she swims the 100-meter freestyle. De Bruijn will be in that, too.</p>
        <p>Thompson now has more Olympic gold medals than any other American woman, but how will not having an individual title affect her legacy?  Especially in the context of these Games, in which swimming records have been set and rebroken. Will history remember her as a great relay swimmer who perhaps lacked the stamina to win individual races consistently?</p>
        <p>Perhaps not everyone is a soloist; not everyone has the ego, the selfishness, the self-absorption needed to be out front.</p>
        <p>Thompson is like the great supporting actress, who makes the movie better without ever being its star. She is the perennial sideman who never starts a solo career but makes the group swing. For the last three Olympics, the American relay teams have needed Thompson as much as she has needed her teammates.</p>
        <p>Quick disagrees.</p>
        <p>''She's a great, great competitor in the individual events, and it took an extraordinary performance by an extraordinary athlete in Inge de Bruijn to beat her,'' Quick said. ''In my opinion, in 1992 she was beaten by someone who was using performance-enhancing drugs.''</p>
        <p>Thompson complained after losing to Zhuang Yong of China in the 100-meter freestyle at the Barcelona Games.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying that about Inge at all; I want that to be in the same sentence,'' Quick said. ''She worked hard. But to say that Jenny is not one of the finest swimmers of all time  would be a mistake.''</p>
        <p>''There's an awful lot of athletes in the history of sports that it wasn't their time in that event,'' Quick said. ''Jenny Thompson has another great event to go in this meet.''</p>
        <p>Quick is right, of course. Thompson has already had an outstanding career and an outstanding Olympics. But in an environment like this, maintaining perspective is a greater challenge than winning the race.</p>
