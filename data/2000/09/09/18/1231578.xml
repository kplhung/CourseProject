        <p>Despite the failures and finacial constraints that cast gloom over the e-commerce sector this summer, the outlook for the holiday shopping season may give some Internet retailers reason for cheer.</p>
        <p>A report to be released on Monday by Jupiter Communications forecasts that online sales in November and December will reach $11.6 billion, up 66 percent from the $7 billion consumers spent online in the the period in 1999. Jupiter predicts travel-related purchases will account for $2.6 billion of this total, and retail sales will comprise the other $9 billion.</p>
        <p>Although this represents a healthy increase over last year's figures, it indicates a slowdown from the triple-digit growth rate experienced from 1998 to 1999. Online holiday sales in 1999 were 126 percent higher than sales in the period in 1998, which totaled $3.1 billion.</p>
        <p>As for which retailers stand to reap the biggest share of the online shopping market, Ken Cassar, a senior analyst for Jupiter, said companies that sell luxury goods, which suffered from a lack of supply last year, should see the biggest increase in sales.</p>
        <p>''This year, the manufacturers are beginning to become willing to authorize the sale of their products online,'' Mr. Cassar said.</p>
        <p>But those looking for predictions about how total holiday sales will be split between different product categories will have to wait until the electronic equivalent of cash register receipts are in.</p>
        <p>''Even estimating the holiday season is a tenuous task,'' Mr. Cassar said. ''To break that down even further, you'd be just guessing.''</p>
        <p>Whereas the focus last year for most e-commerce companies was on gaining market share, the emphasis this year is on profitability. For that reason, Mr. Cassar suggested that the companies that succeed would be those that go after customers who already appreciate the need for their product, have the means to buy it and are willing to buy it online.</p>
        <p>''The retailers that are going to win are going to be those that realistically assess the low-hanging fruit in their markets,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jupiter forecasts that there will be 48 million people shopping online by the end of 2000, and 6 million of them will make their first purchase during this year's holiday season. That compares with 32 million people who had shopped online by the end of 1999.</p>
