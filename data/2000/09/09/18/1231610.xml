        <p>ASIDE from figuring out how to make a profit, one of the more imposing tasks for Internet companies has been breaking through the wall of mistrust that separates them from millions of would-be shoppers who fret about online privacy.</p>
        <p>Companies have posted privacy policies. They have used so-called seal programs offered by organizations like the Better Business Bureau or Truste. And they have advertised heavily to woo recalcitrant shoppers to their sites. Still, the doubts remain: most Internet users who have not shopped online cite inadequate privacy as the main reason, analysts say. And a survey earlier this year by the research firm Odyssey determined that 92 percent of online households do not trust online companies to keep their information private, no matter what they promise.</p>
        <p>Some of the more fearless sites are now putting their reputations on the line, quite publicly, by paying well-known financial services firms to audit their World Wide Web sites and state whether or not their privacy policies are more than just pixels on the screen. In doing so, analysts and privacy advocates said, these Web sites are putting pressure on other e-commerce companies to follow suit, no matter how costly such audits might be.</p>
        <p>Expedia.com, the travel site owned by Microsoft, is the latest company to subject its privacy policies to an audit -- in this case, by the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Expedia said that starting today, the PricewaterhouseCoopers seal, a small box with the company's logo, would appear next to its new privacy policy, along with a statement by PricewaterhouseCoopers attesting that Expedia practices what it preaches. ''This won't directly increase sales,'' said Suzi LeVine, Expedia's marketing manager. ''But it will increase customer confidence in the site. And that, combined with all the services we provide, will increase sales.''</p>
        <p>Ms. LeVine said the company has been revamping its privacy policy and working with PricewaterhouseCoopers for several months. Notably, Expedia's policy states that the Web site will not sell or share a customer's personal information with third parties, unless, for instance, the customer is buying a plane ticket or a trip and the company needs that information to complete the transaction.</p>
        <p>To enforce that promise and others, Expedia paid PricewaterhouseCoopers an undisclosed sum -- which analysts said was probably in the six-figure range -- to visit Expedia's offices and investigate how it handles customer data. Larry Ponemon, the global leader of PricewaterhouseCoopers's privacy practice, declined to comment specifically on what the firm found at Expedia. But he said, ''A vast majority of companies fail the early stages of the audit,'' either because of how their employees handle customer data or because their systems do not adequately protect that data.</p>
        <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers typically works with the companies to refine the way they handle data until they can receive a clean audit, Mr. Ponemon said. But if a Web site refuses to change its practices to conform to its own privacy policies, he said, PricewaterhouseCoopers's contract requires the site to post an unfavorable audit statement for the duration of the audit term, usually three months.</p>
        <p>In opting for a public audit of its privacy practices, Expedia won raves from analysts. ''I think it's great that Expedia has seized the lead, and I'm not surprised,'' said Henry H. Harteveldt, senior analyst with Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm. ''It shows the bar is getting raised regarding what online companies must do to make consumers confident on the Web.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Harteveldt said that among Internet users who did not buy travel-related products this year, 22 percent said they had demurred because of privacy concerns. ''If companies like Expedia can convince even one-tenth of those people to buy, that's a lot of customers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Analysts said E-Loan, an online lending firm, was the first e-commerce company to post results of a privacy audit from one of the Big Five accounting firms, having done so with PricewaterhouseCoopers early last year. Chris Larsen, E-Loan's chief executive, said the audit was a response to a controversy last year surrounding Microsoft and Truste, a nonprofit organization that provides a seal to sites that meet its privacy standards.</p>
        <p>That controversy arose when Truste failed to audit or otherwise penalize Microsoft, a Truste investor and member, after it was disclosed that Microsoft's system software, Windows, collected the hardware identification numbers of some PC users and sent that to Microsoft without the users' consent. Privacy advocates said Truste's seal program lacked teeth. Truste said that its seal covered only Microsoft's Web site -- not its software -- and that the data Microsoft gathered was not transmitted to Microsoft's Web site.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Larsen said he ''completely lost faith in Truste after that,'' so he hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to perform an initial audit of E-Loan's privacy practices and post the results on the E-Loan Web site. That effort cost roughly $250,000 in fees and staff time, an E-loan spokeswoman said. In addition, E-Loan pays PricewaterhouseCoopers an additional $30,000 for each quarterly audit. As to what effect the audit has had on business, Mr. Larsen said: ''It's hard to tell. People have been widely supportive of it, but I see it more as a prerequisite to doing business. Consumers have an expectation of privacy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Larsen said the audits, in which three PricewaterhouseCoopers employees visit E-Loan's offices for three weeks, have had a more tangible effect on the company's business methods. ''No matter how great you think you're doing, things always come up that PWC finds, and we're able to take care of it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Both Truste and the Better Business Bureau Online use audits as part of their seal programs, but analysts said they are less consistent and comprehensive than those performed by the major accounting firms. Dave Steer, a Truste spokesman, said the organization conducts quarterly audits of each member's site via the Web, by ''seeding'' a Web site with personal information and seeing whether the company gives that information to marketers, for instance.</p>
        <p>The Better Business Bureau, meanwhile, performs random, on-site audits of its members, according to Gary Laden, the director of the bureau's online privacy seal program. Mr. Laden said no company has lost its seal as a result of an audit, but he would not disclose which, if any, companies have failed audits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ponemon, of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said an increasing number of Internet companies are seeking privacy audits -- roughly 200 have hired his company for such purposes -- but only recently have more companies agreed to make the results public. Online marketing firms like Foveon and Transaction Data Services have done so, as has CareSoft, publishers of The Daily Apple, a health-related Web site. Of those that have not, he said, ''They don't want the public accountability, nor do they want to become a target of the hacking community.''</p>
        <p>Privacy advocates are, predictably, pleased with those who have gone public with audits, but say more protections are necessary. ''We still need baseline legislation so we can go after bad actors, and we need better technologies that will increase privacy,'' said Ari Schwartz, senior policy analyst for the Center for Democracy and Technology, a privacy group based in Washington. ''But this is an extremely necessary piece of the puzzle.''</p>
