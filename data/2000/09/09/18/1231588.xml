        <p>Onward, Upward  A time machine waiting to transport today's New Yorkers back to the city as it was in the second quarter of the 19th century opens for business tomorrow. That is when the Metropolitan Museum of Art opens an exhibition of more than 300 works that explore the history of art during that fertile period when New York City began to see itself as a world center of culture. Included in the exhibition, ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861,'' are paintings and sculpture, city plans and architecture, photography, prints, decorative arts and fashion. The exhibition continues through Jan. 7. Information: (212) 535-7710.</p>
        <p>A Birthday Tribute  New York without Carnegie Hall may seem unthinkable, but once upon a time this grand auditorium had to be saved from the wrecker's ball. And the man who led the good fight was the violinist Isaac Stern. The year was 1960, and ever since Mr. Stern has been the president of Carnegie Hall. On July 21 Mr. Stern turned 80, and now Carnegie Hall is about to do something for him. It is going to celebrate his birthday in a big way, with not one but two days of observances. ''Isaac Stern at 80: A Carnegie Hall Celebration'' begins at 11 a.m. Saturday, a day devoted to a museum retrospective of his life, featuring material from his personal archives, and to screenings of films about him. Sunday is a day of performances, beginning at 1 p.m. It concludes at 7:30 p.m., when the Symphony Orchestra of the Curtis Institute of Music and distinguished friends and colleagues of Mr. Stern present a birthday concert. Among those scheduled to appear are Emanuel Ax, Yefim Bronfman, Sarah Chang, Glenn Dicterow, Midori, Yo-Yo Ma, Arnold Steinhardt and Pinchas Zukerman. Information: (212) 247-7800.</p>
