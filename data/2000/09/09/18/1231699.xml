        <p>The sudden decision by Peru's president, Alberto K. Fujimori, to call new elections and not run in them himself took the United States and all of Latin America by surprise, officials said today. While welcoming the move, they expressed concern that Peru might face a period of unrest and voiced uncertainty about what role its influential army might play.</p>
        <p>In his decade in office Mr. Fujimori has served Washington as a useful ally in its war against drugs. But he became tangled in a mounting corruption scandal and, since his disputed re-election in May to a third five-year term, had faced increasing pressure from the United States and the Organization of American States to enact democratic reforms.</p>
        <p>While he said in his dramatic television broadcast on Saturday night that he would call new elections immediately, he did not specify when they would be held. It was likely that elections would take six months to organize and that Mr. Fujimori would remain president until then, the secretary general of the O.A.S., Cesar Gaviria, said today.</p>
        <p>In the 24 hours after the president's announcement, the army -- which ruled Peru between 1968 and 1980 -- showed no signs of moving against Mr. Fujimori. There were also no statements from the powerful intelligence chief, Vladimiro Montesinos, whose agency Mr. Fujimori said he was ''deactivating.''</p>
        <p>The future of Mr. Montesinos, a shadowy figure who has been Mr. Fujimori's right-hand man, had begun to appear in doubt after he was shown on a tape on television last week apparently bribing an opposition party member to switch to the president's party. Some senior army officers are believed to be on the side of the intelligence chief. [He is in Lima and under investigation, though he has not been detained, The Associated Press reported.]</p>
        <p>The Organization of American States demanded on Saturday that Mr. Fujimori fire Mr. Montesinos. In his startling appearance just hours later, Mr. Fujimori said he hoped that the new election would satisfy the international community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori won his new term in a runoff election that was boycotted by the opposition candidate, Alejandro Toledo, and condemned internationally as flawed. Of all the American nations, the United States was most vociferous in criticizing the election. Since then, it had seemed more or less reconciled to Mr. Fujimori's continuing in power.</p>
        <p>Thousands of people poured onto the streets of Lima in jubilation early today to celebrate Mr. Fujimori's promised departure from office, which stunned a country more accustomed to the president clinging tenaciously to power. Mr. Fujimori met later today with his cabinet, but issued no public statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's decision to step down appears to have been sparked by the public airing of the embarrassing tape, whose origin remains a mystery. Mr. Montesinos rarely appears in public, and Peruvians and foreign observers were baffled that a tape apparently made in his office could have leaked out and been broadcast on television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo, an economist who mounted a surprisingly strong challenge to Mr. Fujimori before pulling out of the runoff on charges that it was rigged, echoed the Clinton administration's surprise at the president's move. He said today that he hoped to run in the new elections. On Saturday, he was in Washington for talks with officials of the Organization of American States.</p>
        <p>''I'm surprised by how in the end everything was so quick,'' Mr. Toledo told the Reuters news agency in an interview in Miami before boarding a plane back to Peru tonight. ''But what is true is that this was a government that was rotten to the core, and many factors came together to finally bring it down.''</p>
        <p>He said he would try to rally the splintered opposition for the elections. But he also questioned whether Mr. Fujimori's decision would stick. On Saturday night, the Peruvian leader said he did not want to be an obstruction in efforts to strengthen democracy or to be a ''brake on the process of economic recovery.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo said today, ''I doubt Fujimori will keep his word.''</p>
        <p>The Organization of American States applauded Mr. Fujimori for stepping aside, and praised opposition leaders in a statement tonight for not exploiting the volatile situation.</p>
        <p>In heralding Mr. Fujimori's action, a White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, said, ''It is clear that the people in Peru want full democracy, and we hope that all elements in Peru will support this process.''</p>
        <p>A State Department spokesman, Philip T. Reeker, said Mr. Fujimori had taken a praiseworthy ''bold step'' and noted that it came little more than a week after Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met with him at the United Nations summit meeting in New York City.</p>
        <p>In that meeting, Dr. Albright urged Mr. Fujimori to clean up his intelligence structure, which has been at the forefront of the destruction of a democratic judiciary, press and electoral system in Peru, a State Department official said.</p>
        <p>As United States pressure on Mr. Fujimori increased, it was made clear that Peru might face some kind of sanctions, a senior administration official said today.</p>
        <p>''We said we would not have a regular bilateral relationship, and we heard from Lima that he was stung by this,'' the official said. ''We got a step that gets us way beyond where we expected to be.''</p>
        <p>But the official added, ''We need to manage the next few days with the military respecting his decision.''</p>
        <p>In another indication of the mounting United States pressure on Mr. Fujimori, the usually reticent American ambassador to Peru, John Hamilton, spoke out after the tape showing Mr. Montesinos was aired, saying the Peruvian leader should ''take clear measures to restore the faith of the Peruvian people.'' Mr. Hamilton called the situation ''deeply grave.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaviria, the head of the Organization of American States, said in a telephone interview from Bogota, Colombia, that he had been informed today by his mission in Lima that it could take six months to organize the new elections.</p>
        <p>He said that the government and the opposition would have to work together to devise the elections and that they ''may be thinking of changing the rules.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori, 62, is currently the longest-serving elected leader in Latin America. But his inauguration in July was accompanied by riots, arson, the deaths of six people and the arrests of 172.</p>
        <p>In the interview today, Mr. Gaviria said the crucial problem in Peru was the intelligence chief, Mr. Montesinos. ''Everyone felt threatened by him,'' Mr. Gaviria said. ''It's difficult to know how Mr. Fujimori thinks, but his action proves that he believes Mr. Montesinos was involved in criminal activity.''</p>
        <p>He said the Organization of American States mission, as well as working on the elections, would try to work with the government and the opposition to carry out a list of 29 reforms demanded by the organization in June. They included restoring members of the constitutional tribunal who were dismissed last year, he said.</p>
        <p>For years, the Clinton administration had shown considerable reluctance about criticizing Mr. Montesinos, even as the intelligence chief  became increasingly unpopular.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Montesinos appeared to be becoming more of a liability than a strength. He was recently implicated by opposition leaders in a military deal involving the sale of 10,000 Russian assault rifles by the Peruvian military to a rebel group in Colombia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori and Mr. Montesinos had announced that the rifles got to the Colombian group through the Jordanian government, which had sold the rifles to Peru.</p>
        <p>But the Clinton administration backed the Jordanian government in its statements that it had legally sold the rifles to Peru and had nothing to do with their transfer to the Colombian rebels.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori came to power 10 years ago as the ultimate outsider prepared to take on terrorists, including the Shining Path group, self-described Maoists who had disrupted Peru in the 1980's. He was looked upon favorably by Washington because of his successful programs in cutting back poppy production.</p>
        <p>A son of Japanese immigrants who belonged to no party and promised a clean break with the past, Mr. Fujimori disbanded the Supreme Court and Congress in 1992. In 1995, he won re-election in a landslide, an affirmation of his authoritarian ways.</p>
        <p>But in the end, his close alliance with Mr. Montesinos appears to have led to his decision to step aside.</p>
        <p>Opposition leaders have said they believe that the intelligence chief may have incriminating evidence on Mr. Fujimori himself. Another theory circulating in Lima tonight was that Mr. Fujimori had decided to try to fire Mr. Montesinos, but that the move backfired when military chiefs resisted. Mr. Montesinos, himself a former army captain, has been credited in the past with rallying the army behind Mr. Fujimori.</p>
        <p>''At that moment, he understood that he had lost his battle because he couldn't go on as president after unsuccessfully trying to sack Montesinos,'' said Mirko Lauer, a columnist for the newspaper La Republica, whose investigative reporters are knowledgeable about the inner workings of Peru's secretive armed forces.</p>
        <p>''That is the moment he decided to resign,'' Mr. Lauer told The Associated Press.</p>
