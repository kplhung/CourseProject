        <p>ON the wall of his office in the Israeli Embassy in Washington, Ambassador David Ivry has a place of honor for a framed photograph of rubble. It is an American satellite photo of what was left of an Iraqi nuclear reactor after it was destroyed by Israeli warplanes in 1981.</p>
        <p>The ambassador, a legendary fighter pilot and retired major general, directed the operation as commander of the Israeli Air Force. The photo was a gift from Dick Cheney, the United States defense secretary during the 1991 Persian Gulf war and now the Republican vice-presidential nominee. Mr. Cheney signed it ''With thanks and appreciation for the outstanding job you did on the Iraqi nuclear program in 1981, which made our job much easier in Desert Storm!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ivry called that mission the most logistically complicated of his nearly 30 years in the air force. Because pilots had to cross enemy territory for three hours, they had to top off their tanks on the runway -- ''so we could save the last drop of fuel'' -- and leave behind heavy jamming equipment. All the planes returned.</p>
        <p>While Washington would express its gratitude later, the initial American response was outrage that Israel had attacked its Arab neighbor. ''Nobody was expecting that everybody was going to bless us for it,'' Ambassador Ivry recalled.</p>
        <p>Now, nine months after he arrived in Washington, he is embroiled in American-brokered peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians -- an assignment that, like the 1981 raid, entails mind-numbing complexity, daring and the knowledge that some of Israel's friends will not be pleased with the result.</p>
        <p>If there is an agreement, Mr. Ivry will need to explain it to some members of the American Jewish community who oppose the sorts of concessions contemplated by Prime Minister Ehud Barak.</p>
        <p>''This is so complicated,'' he said in an interview in New York, where he spent much of last week while the Clinton administration was trying to revive peace talks during a United Nations meeting. ''There are so many factors to consider,'' he said of the negotiations. ''And you don't know what crisis you may face next.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ivry was not a traditional choice as Israel's chief diplomat in Washington.</p>
        <p>Past ambassadors have been the telegenic public face of Israel. But Mr. Ivry has been virtually absent from the airwaves, and he is quick to acknowledge that he is uncomfortable on the public stage.</p>
        <p>''I didn't ask the prime minister to be ambassador,'' Mr. Ivry said in his heavily accented English.</p>
        <p>Many in Jerusalem assume that Mr. Barak chose this shy, taciturn and distinguished 65-year-old military man as his ambassador in the belief that someone who had spent his life defending Israel's security would be the best salesman here for a peace accord that might seem to threaten it.</p>
        <p>''Ex-generals can be much more forceful in making peace,'' Mr. Ivry said. ''They know the real thing, what a war is.''</p>
        <p>Ambassador Ivry has taken part -- as fighter pilot, air force commander or military policy maker -- in every Israeli war since he joined the military in the early 1950's.</p>
        <p>His parents fled Czechoslovakia for Palestine in 1934 when his father, a wood merchant and committed Zionist, decided that ''there would be no room for the Jews'' in Europe after Hitler's rise. His mother was pregnant at the time with David, the first of three children. Most of the rest of the family remained in Europe and died in the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>As a young Israeli, Mr. Ivry was first assigned to Israel's fleet of Spitfires. ''It's a pleasure to fly any plane, but that was real flying,'' he said of the legendary British-built fighter plane. He went on to qualify to fly 38 different types of aircraft. His favorite: the French Mirage, which he flew in combat during the Six-Day War of 1967.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ivry rose quickly to become commander of the air force from 1977 to 1982. In 1986, he became director general of the Defense Ministry, a post he held for a decade, cementing his reputation for working well with politicians of all stripes. Last year, he was appointed national security adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. When Mr. Barak ousted Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Ivry found himself packing for Washington.</p>
        <p>His wife, Ofra, is a special-education teacher. The couple's two sons -- one an architect, one a photographer -- remain in Israel. A third son, an air force pilot, was killed in the crash of an F-16 in 1987. At the mention of his dead son during the interview, Ambassador Ivry fell silent, his eyes glistening.</p>
        <p>AS he waits for the next round of peace talks to begin, Ambassador Ivry warns that peace with the Palestinians will be needlessly delayed if the Palestinians do not take advantage quickly of the concessions being offered by Mr. Barak, whose political survival is under threat.</p>
        <p>''Some would say that Prime Minister Barak has done more than any leader in Israel has dared to do in the past,'' he said. ''He's taken a lot of risks.''</p>
        <p>But whatever the frustrations of the peace process, Mr. Ivry said he was convinced that there would eventually be a lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians, and with all the Arab nations that were once his enemies on the battlefield and in the air.</p>
        <p>''In the long term, there will be peace,'' he said. ''Both sides need it. All the sides understand there is no other solution.''</p>
