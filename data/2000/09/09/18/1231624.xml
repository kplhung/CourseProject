        <p>For those living in this community at the point where Israel narrows into a slim finger of territory jutting into southern Lebanon, there were many hardships during the 18 years when Israeli soldiers, confronting Palestinian guerrilla groups and heavily armed groups of Lebanese Islamic militants, occupied a deep buffer zone across the border.</p>

        <p>For those living in this community at the point where Israel narrows into a slim finger of territory jutting into southern Lebanon, there were many hardships during the 18 years when Israeli soldiers, confronting Palestinian guerrilla groups and heavily armed groups of Lebanese Islamic militants, occupied a deep buffer zone across the border.</p>
        <p>But the peace that set in after the Israeli troops withdrew into Israel in late May has not proved so congenial, either. In fact, the strains that unsettle Israel's northernmost communities now seem like a metaphor for what could lie ahead if final peace accords are eventually worked out  with the Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese.</p>
        <p>Even with stable borders, old animosities may linger, prejudicing the vision many Israelis cherish of a future living in prosperous community with surrounding states.</p>
        <p>Since Israeli troops completed their pullout in late May, normality has been an elusive thing along the 105-mile border with Lebanon. Hezbollah, the Lebanese Party of God, has stilled the Russian-made Katyusha multiple rocket-launchers that once drove Israelis into underground shelters in exposed communities like Metulla and Qiryat Shemona. But Lebanese with festering animosities engendered by the occupation have found new ways to manifest their anger.</p>
        <p>Like the young Palestinians during the intifada, the Lebanese have turned to stones. And stone-throwing -- at Israeli troops guarding the border, at Israeli farmers working fields and orchards, at kibbutz dwellers now confronted by angry crowds gathering across newly erected border fences -- has proved a challenge for the Israeli soldiers, who are under orders not to retaliate unless Israeli lives are directly threatened.</p>
        <p>Beyond the stone-throwing, Israelis are encountering new hardships. In effect, the occupation extended the Israeli economy northward into the 10 percent of Lebanon held by Israeli troops and their allies in a Christian-led Lebanese militia group, the South Lebanon Army. With the troop withdrawal, the commerce died at a stroke.</p>
        <p>''We are in a bad situation,'' said Jacob Katz, a 48-year-old former Israeli naval officer who is now mayor of the 1,700 people of Metulla. ''When we were in a bad situation with Lebanon, occupying part of their country, the border was open. Now, our troops have withdrawn, but the border is closed. It's all very stupid, if you ask me, and I can tell you, the people of Metulla are having a hard time accepting it.''</p>
        <p>At Fatima Gate, a mile west of Metulla and the busiest of four border crossings in the occupation years, thousands of Lebanese crossed into Israel daily to work in Metulla and Qiryat Shemona. Israeli and Lebanese trucks shuttled back and forth loaded with the cornucopia of Israeli commerce -- new cars, motorcycles, trucks and electronic appliances, cargos of meat and fresh fruit and vegetables, tanker-trucks loaded with gasoline and diesel fuel, pharmaceuticals, clothing, shoes and what-not-else.</p>
        <p>In those years, Israelis and their Lebanese allies, borrowing from Robert Frost's poem about good fences, called the border fence just that -- ''the good fence.'' Now, it's more like Checkpoint Charlie.</p>
        <p>From his post in a watchtower overlooking the border, Lt. Barak Twizer looks out at a vista of hostility through newly-reinforced hatches of stainless steel and a 40-foot-high ''missile fence'' of tightly meshed wire designed to stop stones, rocks, or, in the worst case, shoulder-fired rockets.</p>
        <p>The Lebanese side of the frontier is a forest of yellow and green Hezbollah flags, with a logo showing a raised fist clutching a Kalashnikov assault rifle. On the shields of reinforced concrete slabs that the Israelis have erected just beyond the missile fence, facing the Israeli troops, Lebanese with spray guns have clambered up and scrawled graffiti, in shaky Hebrew script, that shout out hatreds. ''Kill all the Jews!'' they say. ''Go home, sissies!'' ''Palestine is ours!''</p>
        <p>Behind Lieutenant Barak, other soldiers gazed at banks of television screens, using joysticks to re-direct video cameras keeping watch on the border.</p>
        <p>On a recent weekday afternoon, under a blazing summer sun, clusters of Lebanese, including men with small children on their shoulders and women with their heads covered in the Islamic manner, approached the border and cast stones toward the watchtower. Most fell well short, but an occasional shot found its way through the missile fence and struck the watchtower wall.</p>
        <p>For the Lebanese, Fatima Gate has become a tourist attraction, with buses arriving daily from Beirut and Tyre and Sidon carrying those eager to explore a part of their country that was off limits for a generation. Some buses arrive with their own arsenal of stones. Souvenir sellers do a thriving trade in Hezbollah flags and portraits of leading Islamic militants, including Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the cleric who leads Hezbollah, and Osama bin Laden, the Saudi Arabian millionaire said to bankroll militant Islamic groups from Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Despite the stone-throwing, Israeli military commanders betray little nostalgia for the 22-year occupation, which cost the lives of 1,200 Israeli soldiers and consumed about $1 billion a year, a tenth of the annual defense budget, according to figures recently issued by the defense ministry in Jerusalem. ''The stone-throwing is really irritating, but compared to the situation we were in before, it's a vast improvement,'' said a 36-year-old colonel who spent years in the buffer zone.</p>
        <p>The officer, who cannot be identified under Israeli military rules, said few officers believe that Israel has heard the last of Hezbollah, whose offices in Beirut are emblazoned with pictures of Muslim shrines in Jerusalem and slogans quoting Sheik Nasrallah as saying that Israel's extinction is the ultimate Islamic goal. ''I can hear Sheik Nasrallah quite well from here,'' the officer said. ''His decision not to attack us directly now is a smart one, but it's tactical. He sees himself as an Islamic leader, not a Lebanese one. If we have to fight them again, it will be without a buffer zone, and they'll be all over us.''</p>
        <p>For now, residents of Metulla are breathing easier without the tension of listening for loudspeakers warning of imminent rocket attacks.</p>
        <p>''I haven't been so happy in a long time,'' said Miriam Hod, 50, who runs one of a score of tourist motels in Metulla. But picking up a telescope she keeps beside the bay window in her living room, less than half a mile from the border fence, she added: ''But we watch them, and they watch us. I know what they eat and drink.''</p>
        <p>Metulla's tourist trade caters to Israelis escaping the heat and bustle of Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities. Mrs. Hod is struggling with a slump -- 20 percent occupancy rates, according to Mayor Katz, compared with 50 percent before -- that she ascribes to apprehensions caused by the disappearance of the buffer zone.</p>
        <p>Her husband, Haim, a fruit farmer, is struggling, too, hit by the disappearance of migrant Lebanese fruit-pickers, and by stone-throwing incidents that make it difficult to harvest the crops of apples and apricots and cherries and peaches and plums.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, many Israelis in the region remain determinedly optimistic. At Kibbutz Manare, in the mountains above Metulla, frontier adjustments demanded by Lebanon after the withdrawal have brought the border fence to within 200 yards of Tamara Levy's home. And yet, said the 40-year-old mother of three children, ''it's bliss, to wake up in the morning and listen to the quiet.''</p>
        <p>''When I listen, what I hear is no longer guns and helicopters,'' she said. ''I hear the birds.''</p>
