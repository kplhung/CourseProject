        <p>IN recent years, many of the most important decisions at AT&amp;T, the nation's biggest communications company, have taken shape during the board's annual retreat the third week of September.</p>

        <p>IN recent years, many of the most important decisions at AT&amp;T, the nation's biggest communications company, have taken shape during the board's annual retreat the third week of September.</p>
        <p>At the 1995 meeting, for instance, the board helped put the final touches on the plan to spin off the company's communications equipment operation, which became Lucent Technologies. In 1996, the board approved an announcement that AT&amp;T would not meet its remaining financial targets, which removed about $9 billion from the company's market value. During the 1997 meeting, the board decided to hire C. Michael Armstrong, who was then chief executive of Hughes Electronics, as AT&amp;T's chairman.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Armstrong is getting ready for his turn on the hot seat at this year's meeting, which is to begin on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armstrong does not appear to be in imminent danger of losing his job, but AT&amp;T's stock has given up all of the gains it made after he took the helm of the company in October 1997, closing on the New York Stock Exchange Friday at $32.25, compared with more than $60 at one point last spring. If the shares do not stage a significant rally soon, Mr. Armstrong will almost surely be forced to overhaul the company.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T may not announce any big new initiatives during or immediately after this year's retreat, which is to end on Saturday. But in the coming weeks or months, if big moves are announced, they will almost certainly have had their genesis this week.</p>
        <p>Under Robert E. Allen, Mr. Armstrong's predecessor, the September meeting was generally held at the Greenbrier resort in White Sulphur Springs, W. Va. A golf outing was part of the agenda. Spouses were invited.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armstrong ended the country-club trappings. He stopped inviting spouses and moved the meeting from the luxury resort to a more utilitarian (though hardly spartan) AT&amp;T site near the company's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J.</p>
        <p>The idea was to put less emphasis on socializing and more on work. This year, especially, the board members will certainly have a lot to focus on.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's core problem is fairly straightforward.</p>
        <p>Strategically, Mr. Armstrong's moves to revitalize the company have been sound, perhaps even inspired, given AT&amp;T's peculiar position in the communications market. The problem is that he has not been able to persuade investors to stop paying most of their attention to the company's core businesses: the sale of long-distance phone service to consumers and broader communications bundles to corporations. The consumer long-distance business is shrinking faster than most analysts had expected and the unit that serves business customers has stumbled in some mundane but significant ways.</p>
        <p>But even as AT&amp;T's stock has been hammered for the relatively poor performance of the long-distance operations, the company has been making progress in the business of offering bundles of voice, data and video communications over cable television lines.</p>
        <p>And so the company's executives and investment bankers have been hard at work considering various restructuring options meant to underline the value of the relatively strong operations, like the cable unit, while quarantining the performance of the relative laggards, like consumer long-distance. Tracking stocks, spinoffs and leveraged buyouts for various units are all on the table.</p>
        <p>Analysts and investors have also wondered about more exotic possibilities, like a full-fledged merger of AT&amp;T and British Telecommunications or a merger of AT&amp;T's wireless operation with Nextel Communications.</p>
        <p>Either of those courses would include major hurdles. In the case of British Telecom, many AT&amp;T investors would question the sense of the company's doubling-down on the business of rejuvenating an incumbent phone monopoly. A combination with Nextel could well violate federal limits on corporate ownership of airwave licenses.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T has also held discussions with British Telecom about combining the companies' business services and wireless units, according to a report in The Financial Times.</p>
        <p>British Telecom issued a statement yesterday that said it was in talks with AT&amp;T on ways of ''broadening the relationship'' between the companies in business services, but the company did not comment specifically on the Financial Times report.</p>
        <p>Either deal would seem to make a lot more sense than an outright merger of the two giants. In fact, AT&amp;T and the British carrier are already partners in a business services alliance called Concert and an international wireless venture. Neither of those initiatives has appeared to enjoy gangbusters success, at least so far. A good argument could be made, though, that those operations could benefit from even tighter bonds between the partners.</p>
        <p>But none of the potential deals with British Telecom would squarely face what appears to be AT&amp;T's biggest financial problem: the millstone that is the consumer long-distance operation.</p>
        <p>Consumer long-distance service generates billions of dollars in cash for the company, cash that has been vital in underwriting AT&amp;T's cable investments. But the unit's overall revenue is shrinking, perhaps by as much as 8 percent this year. And that makes it more difficult for the company over all to show acceptable growth, on either the top or bottom lines of the balance sheet.</p>
        <p>It is hard to predict how investors would react to a tracking stock for an operation with declining revenue, even if it carried a relatively large dividend. That is one reason why it could make more sense to sell the unit and let it be taken private.</p>
        <p>Either way, critics could question whether such a separation would hamper AT&amp;T's ability to bundle long-distance service with its other communications offerings on favorable terms. That concern, however, would probably be outweighed by the value to AT&amp;T of allowing the stronger parts of its business to shine through.</p>
        <p>No matter which of these or other options the company may choose, if AT&amp;T embarks on a major restructuring, Mr. Armstrong risks the deeper criticism that he is more concerned with financial engineering than with actually managing his business.</p>
        <p>Moreover, any significant reorganization would essentially be a repudiation of Mr. Armstrong's initial vision for the company. AT&amp;T as currently constituted is basically the company that Mr. Armstrong had in mind when he took charge three years ago. An essential component in any restructuring would be a healthy dose of spin.</p>
        <p>It should be an interesting week for the AT&amp;T board.</p>
