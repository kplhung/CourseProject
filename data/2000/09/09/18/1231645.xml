        <p>No matter how comfortable the modern eye is supposed to be with the meagerly attired male form, no matter how many Calvin Klein ads and episodes of ''Baywatch'' it has registered, there's still something very peculiar about seeing a male model lope down a runway in swim trunks the size of a tennis shoe.</p>
        <p>Should you find yourself a witness to such a sight, you might fiddle with your purse or stretch your neck or start doing your expense report in your head. Things don't get much easier when the only other item of clothing a model is wearing is a sarong printed with the face of former President George Bush. That particular look was displayed at Marc Ecko's runway show on Friday evening and raised the question of why someone would bother picturing a member of the Bush family on an article of clothing that screamed ''beach blanket bingo later at my place,'' and then not use the image of George W.</p>

        <p>No matter how comfortable the modern eye is supposed to be with the meagerly attired male form, no matter how many Calvin Klein ads and episodes of ''Baywatch'' it has registered, there's still something very peculiar about seeing a male model lope down a runway in swim trunks the size of a tennis shoe.</p>
        <p>Should you find yourself a witness to such a sight, you might fiddle with your purse or stretch your neck or start doing your expense report in your head. Things don't get much easier when the only other item of clothing a model is wearing is a sarong printed with the face of former President George Bush. That particular look was displayed at Marc Ecko's runway show on Friday evening and raised the question of why someone would bother picturing a member of the Bush family on an article of clothing that screamed ''beach blanket bingo later at my place,'' and then not use the image of George W.</p>
        <p>At any rate, Mr. Ecko's event effectively concluded the spring 2001 men's shows, which were held in Bryant Park and which served as the two-day opening act to the spring 2001 women's collections currently under way there.</p>
        <p>Men's fashion shows are always confounding affairs, but arguably more so in New York than in Milan, because Milan is the world capital of men's designer clothing, not to mention a city where cabdrivers and sandwich vendors look as if they are on their way to audition for a remake of ''8 1/2.'' Men's shows have a longer history in Italy, too. They got going in Florence during the late 1950's in an effort to repopularize the men's wear industry, which had suffered considerably during World War II. It was 10 years later, in the free-thinking year of 1968, before men's shows kicked off in New York with an unveiling of Bill Blass's line at Lincoln Center -- complete with a 50-foot runway and Champagne for the guests.</p>
        <p>At that time, recalled Donald Dolce, who has been a buyer and consultant to the men's wear industry for more than 30 years, ''to show a pair of plaid pants for men was a big deal; it was revolutionary.''</p>
        <p>Of course what is revolutionary in America today is that men who buy and sell multimillion-dollar companies get to wear chinos to work. Knowing that they're happily doing so in the skyscrapers that line Bryant Park makes the whole business of seeing men parade down catwalks in $400 sweaters rather hard to digest. As one young venture capitalist who works in Midtown put it, ''I love Jil Sander suits, but they're too much fashion for the office; it's Dockers land.''</p>
        <p>What made last week's round of men's shows odder still was their timing. In seasons past, the New York shows have been held a week or two after the men's collections in Milan, because it is on the heels of those shows that buyers place their orders for the following season. The spring 2001 Milan men's shows were held in late June, which means that most designers in Europe and New York have already sold their spring lines to stores.</p>
        <p>''Effectively our business is finished,'' said Joseph Abboud, the designer, as he stood before the sportswear and suits he presented over lunch on the rooftop terrace at the Bryant Park Grill on Thursday. ''There's been a lot of soul-searching about when the shows should be held,'' he continued. ''Creatively I'm into fall 2001; this show should have been held two months ago.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Abboud's clothes, there were boxy earth-toned jackets and airy trousers, the sort of thing a man might wear to a sales conference at a Hilton in Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>If the collections had a point to make, it was to remind editors that high-end American men's wear does indeed exist. The trouble is that fashion editors at men's magazines want to be entertained as much as their counterparts at women's magazines, and the New York shows offered little razzle-dazzle, even counting Nautica's use of young stars from the WB network as fashion models.</p>
        <p>If a designer is going to go to all the trouble to put men's clothes on a runway, the clothes might as well be fun to look at, and the only New Yorker who really seems to understand this is Gene Meyer, the purveyor of graphic neckties that became status symbols in the early 1990's. Mr. Meyer has an extraordinary sense of color, and there is also a wit to his designs that he manages to keep within the bounds of good sense. There were shirts patched together in the pattern of a color wheel. He also showed a three-quarter-sleeve sweater in a potent chartreuse and cotton poplin trousers in aqua.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meyer's backers fell on hard times in recent months, and he lost his financing in July. He staged this show on his own dime and is currently looking for a new business partner. ''It's been a weird summer,'' he said a few days before his show. Surely, he must have been pleased that Stephen L. Ruzow, the chairman of the Pegasus Apparel Group, the budding American fashion conglomerate, sat front and center at his show and clapped enthusiastically.</p>
        <p>To their credit, American men's wear designers seem to grasp what so many European designers (with the exception of Giorgio Armani) do not: that most men do not have 28-inch waists and legs as thin as linguini strands. The silhouette shown here was wider, looser, more accommodating to the man who might even ingest a carbohydrate every now and then. Peg-legged pants were hard to spot.</p>
        <p>Nowhere was such a look paid greater tribute than at John Varvatos's show on Thursday morning, his second ever. His cotton pants and linen pants practically billowed. His linen three-button suits hung softly. Even his more narrowly cut shorts, nicely done in a steel-gray suede, offered plenty of breathing room. ''What's remarkable about John,'' said Tom Kalendarian, the men's fashion director at Barneys New York, ''is that his clothes look good on bodies that go to the gym, but they look good on regular guys too.'' Mr. Kalendarian added, ''He designs for the average Joe.''</p>
        <p>One problem with Mr. Varvatos's show was the styling. Rare in New York is the man who is going to embrace a woven belt. In some instances, shirts were left untucked on one side and tucked on the other, suggesting a person working very hard at coming off as laid back.</p>
        <p>There was a wraparound shirt at Polo Ralph Lauren's presentation in the Pool Room at the Four Seasons that had the same effect. Models stood over the pool (which had been covered for the occasion), staring out at guests in a live tableau. Many of Mr. Lauren's clothes -- brightly colored polo shirts with logo paired with brightly colored belted chinos -- looked just as they had following their conquest of college campuses not long after he held his first presentation, at the ''21'' Club in 1972.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lauren has traditionally, and wisely, avoided showing his men's clothes on a runway. ''He never liked the idea,'' said Buffy Birrittella, an executive vice president at Mr. Lauren's company. ''It's too fashion.''</p>
        <p>That's a lesson Tony Melillo, who discontinued his Nova line after he lost his backers a few months ago, seems to have absorbed. Mr. Melillo's cotton pants and T-shirts for men and women never really belonged on the runway. Now, focusing solely on men's wear, Mr. Melillo has started a new line, under his own name, of drapey cotton judo pants and slick track suits. His clothes are simple and look comfortable, and he showed them in a manner other young designers might very well consider: on a garment rack in his apartment.</p>
