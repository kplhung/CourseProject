        <p>Dreams, even Olympic ones, come with a price.</p>
        <p>Every day, the American Olympic boxer Dante Craig wonders what price he has paid to pursue a medal at the Summer Games.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, Craig has gone from being a retired amateur fighter pressing pants for a dry cleaner to becoming a surprise contender in the Olympic welterweight division. He has lost his mother to breast cancer and a 3-month-old son to a respiratory ailment. He has grieved outside the ring in ways he never imagined and succeeded inside the ring in ways he never imagined.</p>
        <p>When Craig climbed through the ropes for his first Olympic fight Saturday night, his first gesture was to point upward as a signal to his late mother and son. Next, he wiped his tears on the padding of his boxing gloves.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't help thinking how my mom would have liked to see this,'' Craig said. ''And I wished my son could see his daddy perform tonight.''</p>
        <p>Then, Craig dominated his opponent, Fadel Showban Showban of Egypt, bringing the bout to an end with a sudden, fierce and vicious flurry of third-round punches.</p>
        <p>''I scare myself sometimes with outbursts like that,'' Craig said afterward. ''I don't feel mad about anything, but when I watch the videotape of my fights, I say, 'Dang, I got a lot of anger in me.' ''</p>
        <p>He has come from virtually nowhere, and not just from the back room of a Cincinnati dry cleaner, to this position as a rising star on the potent American team, which won its four fights in the first weekend of the boxing competition.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Craig didn't get past the quarterfinals of the national Golden Gloves championships. It was the year his mother died, and Craig, then 20 years old, decided to end a boxing career he began 7 years earlier, never producing a major championship.</p>
        <p>When his older brother, Dion, came to him early the next year and said that he had been visited by their mother in a dream and that she had asked Dion to get Dante in the ring again, Dante was shaken.</p>
        <p>''I thought it must be true,'' he said. ''But how do you just get started again?''</p>
        <p>There were financial logistics, because Craig was making $400 a week by pressing 70 pants an hour. ''More pants than anyone else could do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His brother, a stockroom clerk, said he would give him $50 a week if he quit the job and started running and training full time. The Olympic boxing trials were a little more than a year away.</p>
        <p>''He made me feel like I had to give it a shot,'' Craig said. ''That dream certainly had affected him -- and me.''</p>
        <p>In 1999, Craig won a national Golden Gloves and Police Athletic League championship. Still, he lost in the quarterfinals of the national championships, and he was hardly a favorite heading into the series of boxing tournaments that would shape the United States Olympic team.</p>
        <p>Last Jan. 10, his son, Dante Jr., died unexpectedly of respiratory failure.</p>
        <p>''I know God has a reason for everything,'' Craig said of his son's death. ''But I still don't understand why.''</p>
        <p>In the spring, Craig was part of the American Olympic box-offs, but the clear welterweight favorite was the two-time national champion Larry Mosley. In the round robin of qualifying tournaments, Craig would have to beat Mosley twice to make the United States team.</p>
        <p>And that's what he did.</p>
        <p>''Unbelievable,'' Craig said.</p>
        <p>Now he is in Sydney, with his brother and his father, Ronald. He weeps before his fights, glowers during them, smiles after them.</p>
        <p>''It's hard sometimes to add it all up,'' said Craig, whose second-round fight is Thursday. ''All the good that's happened, all the bad that's happened. All the difficult things you never dreamed would happen to you, all the good things that you never dreamed would happen to you.</p>
        <p>''You try not to question what it took or why. I'll never know.''</p>
        <p>Craig paused, with a look that was somewhere between his two usual expressions, glee and grief.</p>
        <p>''All I can do is go out there and honor their memory,'' he said.</p>
        <p>PUNCH LINES</p>
        <p>The American light-flyweight BRIAN VILORIA survived a tough first-round opponent on Sunday as he outpointed the European champion, SERGEI KAZAKOV of Russia, in a close fight, 8-6. Viloria, the world amateur champion and a gold-medal favorite, faced Kazakov two years ago and won by just 1 point.</p>
        <p>''It was a big victory right off the bat,'' Coach TOM MUSTIN said of Viloria's bout. ''A guy like that could bring an early upset.''</p>
        <p>Viloria, who is 5 feet 4 inches and 106 pounds, found it difficult to hit the taller, left-handed Kazakov, who used the upright style common to Russian fighters. But Viloria was quicker and his defense superb. Even as Kazakov tried to mount a rally in the final round, Viloria deflected all but one of his punches.</p>
        <p>''I knew it would be a close fight,'' Viloria said. ''I just had to get past it because I usually get stronger as the tournament goes on.''</p>
        <p>The American lightweight DAVID JACKSON defeated NAOUFEL BEN RABAH of Tunisia on points, 19-7.</p>
