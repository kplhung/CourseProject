        <p>Ragged Hurricane Gordon, never a particularly frightening storm to begin with, lost power as it crept toward Florida's gulf coast today and became more of a nuisance than a threat.</p>
        <p>By this evening, as the storm's disorganized eye reached land near Cedar Key, a small island on Florida's northwest coast, it had already been downgraded to a tropical storm, and fears of wind damage and great flooding subsided. The storm's top gusts reached 68 miles an hour near the eye.</p>
        <p>The storm had seemed imposing enough as it swirled in the Gulf of Mexico to cause about 280,000 people to evacuate a strip of Florida coastline from Tampa Bay to the state's northwestern coast.</p>
        <p>But as the afternoon wore on, the storm caused little structural damage to homes, though it did bring traffic problems as its outer bands buffeted Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Those outer bands, which toppled part of a wall at a bayfront hotel in Tampa, sent waves crashing over causeways and forced the closing of some bridges in Tampa Bay, turned out to be the most powerful part of the storm, which caused minor coastal flooding farther north.</p>
        <p>''It's been very wet,'' said Bill Frederick, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami. ''The rain bands are rather large. One rain band covers the enter state.''</p>
        <p>Floodwater from Tampa Bay crept into some homes in traditionally flood-prone areas, and a storm surge sent water from the gulf pouring into others.</p>
        <p>A four-foot surge sent water from Tampa Bay into some streets in downtown Tampa, and streets flooded on St. Pete Beach, but residents said over and over that they had gotten off easy.</p>
        <p>As the storm moved onto land in Florida's Big Bend area, the part of the coast where the peninsula of Florida meets the Panhandle, fears of large storm surges along most of the coast subsided as high tides came and went, and winds dropped.</p>
        <p>The storm, much weakened but still dumping heavy rain, headed across northern Florida on a path that was expected to take it through Georgia and into South Carolina and North Carolina before, probably, heading out to sea.</p>
        <p>Cedar Key, a low-lying island off the coast of the state's northwestern peninsula, was mostly empty as the storm came ashore.</p>
        <p>Its population of about 800 was asked to voluntarily evacuate, but many residents, seeing the storm's power dwindle, stayed. The bridge to the island closed this afternoon as emergency management officials prepared for a storm surge of seven feet or more at the key, which is just three feet above sea level.</p>
        <p>The area is one of Florida's least populated, and includes a wildlife refuge near the mouth of the Suwanee River. The mainland in that part of the coastline is mostly small towns and mangrove swamps.</p>
        <p>To the south, as it became clear that winds posed little real threat, flooding was the main concern. Along Route 19, on the western coast, gas stations, restaurants and stores closed, and people hurriedly piled sand bags in front of doors in Hernando and Citrus Counties.</p>
        <p>Bharat J. Trivedi, 53, manager of a Texaco station in Homosassa Springs in Citrus County, watched as heavy rains flooded his parking lot.</p>
        <p>''This is a new experience,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Crystal River, about 30 miles south of Cedar Key, Frances M. Roberts, 54, general manager of the Best Western Crystal River Resort, worried about damage to her town house as she worked the front desk.</p>
        <p>But as the afternoon wore on into evening, it looked as if the region would get a lot of rain, some flooding, and little else.</p>
        <p>''If not, I'm insured,'' Ms. Roberts said.</p>
        <p>Some of the most severe damage came early. A tornado, spawned by the storm's outer bands when it was still classified as a hurricane, damaged mobile homes all the way across Florida in Broward County.</p>
        <p>And what may have been another tornado downed power lines in Fort Myers, in southwest Florida.</p>
        <p>Most of the tens of thousands of people who left their homes along the state's gulf coast were living in mobile homes, emergency management officials said.</p>
        <p>But some mobile-home residents saw little reason to flee a storm that seemed circumspect to begin with.</p>
        <p>In Weeki Wachee, in Hernando County, Frank Bush, a retired truck driver, ignored a mandatory evacuation order in his mobile-home park.</p>
        <p>''I'll keep watching the water,''  Mr. Bush, 68, said.</p>
        <p>Some people were disappointed.</p>
        <p>''We thought there would be more wind,'' said Pascal E. Allemann, a Swiss tourist who was visiting Tampa Bay with his wife, Salome. Mr. Allemann, 27, who works for Hertz in Bern, and Salome, 22, a medical assistant, were on their honeymoon.</p>
        <p>''We saw the sun in Daytona, the hurricane here, and next is the Everglades,'' Mr. Allemann said. ''We saw everything.''</p>
        <p>While the storm was kind to Florida, it had been deadly in Guatemala. The deaths of 19 people there were attributed to heavy rains.</p>
        <p>Emergency management officials in Florida said they expected damage to be spread over a big part of the state, but that the damage would be minor.</p>
        <p>''This storm is going to impact the entire state,'' Gov. Jeb Bush said earlier today.</p>
        <p>National Guard troops and other emergency workers were standing by to help.</p>
        <p>Out in the Gulf of Mexico, helicopters hurriedly ferried oil-rig workers from platforms to safety, leaving the rigs deserted by this morning.</p>
        <p>But Gordon was never that kind of storm.</p>
        <p>At Cape Canaveral, NASA officials  decided to leave the space shuttle Discovery on the launching pad instead of rolling it into the hangar.</p>
        <p>And in Tampa Bay, the city's hockey team, the Lightning, did not call off its game tonight with the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
        <p>''All this seemed like was a typical Florida rain storm,'' said Lori Siler, an accountant who lives in Tampa. ''I wasn't concerned at all.''</p>
