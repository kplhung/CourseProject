        <p>A leading bridge journalist, Herman De Wael of Belgium, noted an interesting fact when the European Championship was played in Villamoura, Portugal, in 1995. The coat of arms of that town has six hearts on each side, and since then he has been looking for a Villamoura hand. It must feature a 6-6 heart fit, and he finally found the deal shown in the diagram. It was played at the end of the qualifying stage of the world championships this month in Maastricht, the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>At many tables East's opening bid was two diamonds. This was a convention that is popular in Europe, the multi, promising a weak-two bid in a major suit. West assumed that his partner held a spade suit but had doubts when South overcalled in spades. When North raised to four spades, the picture changed totally. It was now clear that it was a Villamoura hand: six-six in hearts, but it was not clear what he should do with that information.</p>

        <p>A leading bridge journalist, Herman De Wael of Belgium, noted an interesting fact when the European Championship was played in Villamoura, Portugal, in 1995. The coat of arms of that town has six hearts on each side, and since then he has been looking for a Villamoura hand. It must feature a 6-6 heart fit, and he finally found the deal shown in the diagram. It was played at the end of the qualifying stage of the world championships this month in Maastricht, the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>At many tables East's opening bid was two diamonds. This was a convention that is popular in Europe, the multi, promising a weak-two bid in a major suit. West assumed that his partner held a spade suit but had doubts when South overcalled in spades. When North raised to four spades, the picture changed totally. It was now clear that it was a Villamoura hand: six-six in hearts, but it was not clear what he should do with that information.</p>
        <p>South showed slam interest with a cue-bid of five hearts, which was the first time that suit had been bid. North bid the slam on the strength of his trump strength. If South could move toward slam with weak trumps, he must be in control of the side suits.</p>
        <p>What was West to do? He was sure that his partner held the heart ace, but a lead in that suit would predictably be ruffed. What would the result be in seven hearts doubled? He could expect one spade loser, one club loser and one or two diamond losers.</p>
        <p>Was there a chance of defeating six spades? He thought so, and led the heart king. South ruffed, as expected, and after drawing trumps found a sure way to make his slam. He led to the club ace, returned to dummy with a trump lead, and finessed the club jack. When this won, the slam was made. If it had lost, West would have been forced to lead a red suit. A heart would give a ruff-and-sluff, and a diamond would give South two tricks in that suit. In either case South would be able to discard a diamond on dummy's fifth club.</p>
        <p>So South scored 1,430, and East-West had not taken full advantage of their Villamoura hand. A save in seven hearts would have failed by three tricks, for a penalty of 800.</p>
