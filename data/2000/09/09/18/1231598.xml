        <p>After Al Gore announced that Joseph I. Lieberman would be his running mate last month, Mr. Lieberman immediately  made the rounds of all the various television news outlets.</p>
        <p>That is, all except one: the Fox News Channel, the cable network created by Rupert Murdoch to counter what he called  CNN's liberal bias.</p>
        <p>Fox News executives were furious, especially when a campaign spokesman told the network that it had been left out of the loop because it had ''a certain editorial predisposition and because of that you will sometimes be left out.''</p>
        <p>Within hours, top network executives confronted top Gore campaign officials, who assured them that the spokesman was speaking out of turn in the heat of a busy campaign day.</p>
        <p>''By the end of the week, he was on our air,'' said John Moody, the Fox News Channel vice president for news.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch must find considerable pleasure even in  such examples of momentary disrespect. When it began four years ago, his cable venture, a unit of the News Corporation,  was ridiculed by competitors and doubted by Wall Street. Ted Turner, the founder of CNN, said he would ''squish him like a bug.''</p>
        <p>But Fox is growing in ratings, household distribution and revenue. And, in what must be icing on Mr. Murdoch's cake, this growth has been widely credited with sending CNN into a soul-searching re-evaluation of its own mission.</p>
        <p>But the network's fight for acceptance as a mainstream source of news may be hindered by the very positioning Mr. Murdoch has championed. Fairly or not, it is perceived in many quarters as having a right-wing bias. Democrats are sometimes loath to appear on its programs, fearing they would not be treated fairly.</p>
        <p>Republicans sometimes fail to show up, prompting Fox executives to speculate that the party takes its viewers for granted and feels it is  unnecessary to preach to the converted.</p>
        <p>Perhaps these are the natural pitfalls of the network's strategy to pick up viewers who believe the majority of the news they see on television is rife with liberal biases.</p>
        <p>In many other respects, that strategy seems to be working quite well.</p>
        <p>Fox News Channel executives said they have been able to gain market share on its cable news competitor, MSNBC in audience, and nipping at CNN's heels by occupying a unique place in the television news landscape: giving voice, they said, to conservative commentators and heavily covering conservative issues ignored by other television outlets.</p>
        <p>''I think there is an underserved audience that is hungry for fair and balanced news,'' said Roger E. Ailes, the Fox News Channel chairman and chief executive who put together the network for Mr. Murdoch. ''If the conservative point of view is not presented anywhere else in journalism, then those people will come to us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ailes said Fox News gives both sides of the issues their due and that is why he has marketed the channel as ''Fair &amp; Balanced.''</p>
        <p>How that all plays out in the network's coverage is open for interpretation.</p>
        <p>Asked to cite an example of how its philosophy affects its news coverage, John Moody, the channel's vice president for news, pointed to its stated editorial policy on executions. ''Our execution stories start with a declarative sentence of what the person was convicted of,'' he said. ''We say: 'So-and-so was convicted of such-and-such last night. He was put to death.' ''</p>
        <p>Criticizing the way other networks cover executions, Mr. Moody said, ''Is that editorializing as much as saying 'thousands wailed outside, and then, a sudden hush?' ''</p>
        <p>He also cited a recent special focusing on examples of the government infringing on the rights of citizens.</p>
        <p>As far as the presidential campaign goes, executives at the network said they believed its coverage had been as hard on Mr. Gore as it had been on his Republican opponent, George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>Brit Hume, a former ABC anchor who is the host of a nightly political program, ''Special Report With Brit Hume,'' cited a recent segment that ran on his program about accusations that Republicans had inserted a subliminal message -- the word ''Rats'' -- into a commercial critical of Mr. Gore. In the report, the Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron pointedly referred to Mr. Bush's mispronunciation of the word ''subliminal'' when he denied those charges.</p>
        <p>''The Bush campaign, they don't like it when his inability to pronounce the names of foreign leaders, and certain words, is pointed out,'' said Mr. Hume, who, also noted that the channel was first to report on the appearance of the subliminal message in the advertisement.</p>
        <p>Yet conservative media monitors, members of the Gore campaign and Fox's competitors believe the network is tougher on Mr. Gore than other outlets are.</p>
        <p>''Fox is the most likely to do stories embarrassing to Al Gore,'' said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the Media Research Center, a conservative media research center.</p>
        <p>For instance, Mr. Graham pointed to a recent Fox report that detailed veterans' recriminations against Mr. Gore for failing to attend the annual American Legion convention last month. Mr. Bush, however, did appear. The report did not appear on the other networks, Mr. Graham said.</p>
        <p>He said this is a good thing, helping to counterbalance bias in other television outlets. But Erik Sorenson, MSNBC's vice president and general manager, said he believed his network by and large covered the same political reports critical of Mr. Gore that the Fox News Channel did. But, he said, Fox would give those stories more time by discussing them on its night talk shows.</p>
        <p>Referring to the recommendation of an Arkansas bar committee that President Clinton's law license be suspended, Mr. Sorenson said: ''Our approach is to give it 30 seconds, or a minute. They're going to talk about it for four hours.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration does not seem to disagree. During the impeachment trial of President Clinton, White House officials believed Fox was helping to rile up the Republican ranks, and they often balked at providing guests.</p>
        <p>''That was the only news organization that we felt was biased against us.'' said Lanny J. Davis, the former special counsel to Mr. Clinton who worked as a paid political analyst for Fox in the recent Republican and Democratic conventions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said he ultimately prevailed upon administration officials to allow him to appear on the network during the impeachment crisis.</p>
        <p>In critiques of Fox, it is usually noted that Mr. Ailes was a political consultant to Richard M. Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George Bush.</p>
        <p>But Gore campaign officials are far less scathing in their criticism. The reach of the channel's news reports is not lost on them. They know the Fox correspondents' reports are often repackaged and sent to Fox broadcast channels across the country.</p>
        <p>They said they believed Mr. Gore  was treated fairly by Fox's political reporters, like Jim Angle, the former editor of National Public Radio's ''All Things Considered'' who is now covering the candidate. And they noted that the campaign's officials are often represented on network programs like ''Special Report With Brit Hume.''</p>
        <p>Rather, they said they took some issue with the Fox News Channel's highly rated, prime-time commentators, like Bill O'Reilly, of ''The O'Reilly Factor'' -- with the second-highest audience in cable news in prime time -- or Sean Hannity, the conservative radio talk-show host whose foil is Alan Colmes the liberal talk-show host who is considered by many Democrats to be overshadowed by his co-host on ''Hannity &amp; Colmes.'' Gore campaign officials cited that lineup when they did not give the network the initial interview with Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>The commentators are often compared to Rush Limbaugh, the conservative talk radio host. Night in and night out on Fox News Channel programs Mr. Gore is accused of being a ''serial campaign finance abuser,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton is labeled a fake, and Mr. Clinton is regularly ridiculed.</p>
        <p>The commentators are often counterbalanced with liberal guests or contributors, but Gore campaign officials say the shows tend to help keep an anti-Gore message in circulation while revving up the Republican base -- ''no small thing,'' in the words of one official.</p>
        <p>But, they say, they believe the commentators are probably addressing an audience that, for the most part, is not inclined to vote for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Is it? Fox News Channel executives say they do not think so. ''We have a lot of liberals who watch us,'' Mr. Ailes said. ''We get mail from them.''</p>
        <p>But its competitors were quick to point out that the channel's ratings were much higher during the Republican National Convention than they were during the Democratic National Convention, making a case that it was more popular among Republicans than it was among Democrats.</p>
        <p>Still, despite its good ratings showing during the Republican convention, executives with Fox and officials with the Republican National Committee, said there was tension over the provision of Republican guests. Fox News Channel executives complained they were not getting the same access to guests as the other broadcast and cable networks.</p>
        <p>''They bought the spin that we were somehow more conservative, and therefore may have taken us for granted,'' Mr. Ailes said. ''I think we've made it clear to them in no uncertain terms that if they want their point of view out there, they have to understand we are a growing news network, with some serious audience, and this is a competitive game and they have to compete.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ailes does acknowledge that, at the very least, these are the sorts of annoyances that the network has to contend with because of its stated editorial philosophy. He said he thinks they will abate over time and are caused in large part by criticisms from the competing news networks that are steeped in liberalism.</p>
        <p>The political establishment, he said, is used to television news with liberal biases.</p>
        <p>For instance, Mr. Ailes said, that some are pointing only to Fox's convention ratings to gauge its political disposition is revealing in itself. If it is going to be noted that the Fox News Channel drew a larger audience during the Republican convention than it did during the Democratic convention, then it should also be noted that CNN drew a larger audience during the Democratic convention than it did during the Republican convention. CNN, he said, tends to showcase ''a liberal point of view.'' Soon after the convention, CNN staff members had taken to calling the Fox News Channel ''G.O.P. TV'' and Fox staff members had taken to calling CNN the ''Clinton News Network.''</p>
        <p>(Tom Johnson, the CNN chairman and chief executive, took issue with accusations that the network is infused with liberal bias, saying, ''CNN's success worldwide was built by providing accurate and balanced coverage. We have never wavered from this quality and will not.'')</p>
        <p>But the question remains, can Fox News Channel ultimately draw an audience as large as CNN's -- it was Mr. Murdoch's ultimate goal to beat CNN -- especially when viewed as a niche network?</p>
        <p>Executives with the News Corporation said they thought it could and would. Peter Chernin, the News Corporation president, credited Mr. Ailes -- who is currently renegotiating his contract -- with creating a network that has wider appeal than perhaps it is given credit for.</p>
        <p>''He has created something that is lively and engaging and vibrant,'' Mr. Chernin said. More importantly, with distribution of the channel at 54 million and projected to head to 66 or 67 million in the next two years -- it recently signed a major deal with Comcast -- Mr. Chernin said he expected the network would eventually make hundreds of millions of dollars in profit for the News Corporation.</p>
        <p>It also gives the News Corporation what a newly merged AOL-Time Warner would have in CNN -- a producer of news bits that can be distributed across different technological platforms, from televisions to personal computers to palm pilots.</p>
        <p>''In the end, we got in the game,'' Mr. Ailes said. ''And now we're beginning to win the game.''</p>
        <p>Editors' Note:  September 19, 2000, Tuesday  An article in Business Day yesterday reported on the rise of the Fox News Network and its efforts to combat a perception that it advances a conservative political agenda. The article quoted Fox executives who said they sought to present fair and balanced news coverage.</p>
        <p>In editing, however, the article was headlined ''The Right Strategy for Fox: Conservative Cable Channel Gains in Ratings War.'' In attributing a general political viewpoint to the network, the headline exceeded the facts in the article.</p>
