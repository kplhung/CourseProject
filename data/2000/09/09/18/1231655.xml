        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>As a native New Yorker, I have my own scientific theory about why Manhattanites are so rushed and buzzed. It's not overcrowding, career pressures or noise levels, although these factors certainly don't help. It's the bedrock.</p>
        <p>Manhattan Island is sitting atop a huge outcrop of Manhattan schist, a metamorphosed form of slate. This dense crystallized rock not only allows the erection of skyscrapers but also accounts for much of our hyperactivity. For if crystals have been proved to store and refocus energy, then the inhabitants of this small island are being zapped daily by their own vital energy, which is absorbed and emitted again by the bedrock. Support for this theory can be found in the diary of John Adams, dated 1774, in which he characterizes New Yorkers as talking loud, fast and all together. ''If they ask you a question, before you can utter 3 words of your answer, they will break out upon you again -- and talk away,'' he wrote. This when the city was nothing more than a small village with no technological infrastructure. So it must be either the air or the bedrock. I vote for the schist.</p>
        <p>THERESE McNALLY</p>
        <p>The inquiries received about the outdoor concerts by the New York Grand Opera Company reminded Charlotte Kellar of some questions and comments directed at her waiter during a voyage on the Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
        <p>''What time is the midnight snack served?''</p>
        <p>''Does the staff sleep on board?''</p>
        <p>''Get that black stuff off my plate,'' referring to caviar.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>I was waiting for a bus on 23rd Street and 10th Avenue on a muggy Sunday afternoon when a fragile-looking woman joined me and asked if I'd been there long. I smiled and said that on a day like that it always seemed to be very long. A few minutes later, a woman carrying a modest-sized case joined us. We both peered down the street as though our stares would cause the bus to materialize. Suddenly, the fragile-looking woman stretched out her arm toward the back of the shelter, obviously trying to prevent a fall. But she missed and fell onto the pavement.</p>
        <p>In nanoseconds, a young man had taken off his backpack and placed it under her head. A woman took out her cell phone and dialed 911. The young woman with the case opened it, took out a stethoscope and examined the woman. A police car arrived. As an ambulance drove up, my heart slowly descended from my mouth to its rightful place in appreciation of living in a city where a crisis brings out the best in everyone.</p>

        <p>PLUMBING THE DEPTHS</p>
        <p>The plumber came, the plumber went.</p>
        <p>A hundred-dollar incident.</p>
        <p>He changed the faucet, stopped the leak,</p>
        <p>And I slept well for one whole week.</p>
        <p>But now the leak's come dripping back,</p>
        <p>And I'm about to blow my stack.</p>
        <p>The plumber's given me the slip,</p>
        <p>And won't stop by to fix the drip.</p>
        <p>There's one more point that gives me pain:</p>
        <p>My hundred dollars down the drain.</p>
        <p>DON WEILL</p>
        <p>Mary Pleshette Willis was picking out cucumbers at Fairway when an elderly man asked what she was buying. ''Cucumbers,'' she replied. He shook his head, pointed to a pile of Kirbys and indicated he'd like to know what they were. Ms. Willis explained that they were cucumbers, too, but were generally used for pickles. ''That's not it either,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A few minutes later he tapped her on the shoulder and asked her to identify a large hothouse seedless variety.</p>
        <p>''Listen,'' she said, a bit annoyed. ''This is the third time you've asked me about cucumbers.''</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry,'' he apologized. ''What I'm looking for looks like a cucumber but isn't. I can't remember what it's called.''</p>
        <p>''Zucchini?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>''That's it,'' he exclaimed joyfully. ''I was going through the alphabet but I hadn't come to Z.''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>An article about the Lower East Side brought to mind a recent visit to Russ &amp; Daughters, an appetizing store still on Houston Street. Almost four decades ago in the early 1960's, working my way through law school, I lived in that area, at Second Street and Avenue C, where the rents were the lowest in Manhattan, and I often stopped at the store.</p>
        <p>The first thing I noticed on my latest visit was the gleaming display cases of lox and fish where once open counters stood. Behind the display case stood an employee, a young Hispanic man in his 20's. I thought to myself, ''This store used to be totally Jewish.''</p>
        <p>The only customer in the store was a very old man with a long white beard who reminded me of my Jewish grandfather. He was looking at the barrels of pickles lined up against the wall and then he turned and looked at the man behind the counter. When their eyes met, the counterman said, ''Hello, Izzy, vos machstu?'' Without missing a beat, the old man replied, ''Bien, Pedro, bien. Y tu? Y como esta tu familia?''</p>
        <p>Mouth agape, I listened as they continued to carry on a bilingual conversation -- the Hispanic in Yiddish and the Jew in Spanish. I picked out a pickle and paid for it, realizing that some things had changed but that the ability of New Yorkers to adapt keeps growing.</p>

        <p>FROM A FRESHMAN</p>
        <p>Days calm.</p>
        <p>Skies sunny.</p>
        <p>Please, Mom,</p>
        <p>Send money.</p>
        <p>THE REPLY</p>
        <p>Days gray,</p>
        <p>No doubt of</p>
        <p>That -- hey,</p>
        <p>We're out of!</p>

        <p>Strangers on a train, New York version: Mark Brill was on the N train into Manhattan from Queens when an attractive woman entered and headed for the empty seat next to him. The train lurched forward, she lost her balance and literally fell into his lap. She smiled in what he described as ''that New York City nonchalant manner.'' Taken by surprise, he just looked at her, then said,  ''Thank you,'' to the amusement of the other passengers. The woman freed herself from his lap and moved to her seat. The two began their respective reading without so much as another glance or word, both back in their urban shells.</p>
        <p>Holly Swenson refers to Doris Swenson, her grandmother, as Nana. On the school bus en route to kindergarten one day, Holly was surprised to hear that the little girl beside her also had a Nana. ''Is your Nana married to someone named Granddad?'' Holly asked. ''Yes,'' her seatmate replied. ''That's great,'' Holly said. ''We must be cousins.''</p>
