        <p>Faced with a doubling of his electricity costs this summer, an East Harlem supermarket owner found a creative way to try to remain in business.

        <p>Faced with a doubling of his electricity costs this summer, an East Harlem supermarket owner found a creative way to try to remain in business. ''We're going to generate our own electricity,'' said Alfredo Rodriguez, 39, who owns the Associated Supermarket on East 116th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues.</p>
        <p>After receiving his latest monthly electric bill of $12,100, more than double the cost for the same period last year and the largest bill in 11 years of operation, Mr. Rodriguez went forward with plans to become independent of the Consolidated Edison Company by installing his own electrical generator.</p>
        <p>At a recent sidewalk demonstration in Washington Heights, where he joined neighborhood residents protesting the spike in electricity costs, he said that if he had not been introduced to self-generation by KeySpan Energy Delivery, the part of the KeySpan Corporation that includes the former Brooklyn Union Gas Company, he would have closed his store. ''We just couldn't survive,'' he said. ''So we looked into the generator.''</p>
        <p>Making one's own electricity, a phenomenon called distributed generation, has been an option for large power consumers for years. But the 10,000-square-foot Associated Supermarket will be among Manhattan's smallest independent businesses making its own electricity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez estimated that the generator would cost $7,000 a month to run -- $4,400 to lease the equipment and $2,600 for fuel. Maintenance and a projected engine overhaul are factored in, he said. Further savings could be realized, he said, by using hot water from the boiler to heat his store in the winter, a process called cogeneration.</p>
        <p>That would represent savings of about $5,000 over his most recent bill, and, he expects, savings even in months when the electricity bill would have been lower. And his costs will drop further after five years, when the generator is fully paid for.</p>
        <p>The main issue for smaller businesses considering such a move is how much power they use, said Peter Grzybowski, a KeySpan engineer. Supermarkets running refrigerators nonstop, for example, are good candidates for cogeneration. ''There is a high capital cost'' in generating electricity, he said, but added: ''If there is a payback period of less than five years, we look into it. If it's less than three years, we should seriously consider cogeneration.''</p>
        <p>A Brooklyn laundry has had mixed results with bypassing Con Ed. ''My first generator was a disaster,'' said Nick Nanas, the manager of Aphrodite Cleaners in Greenpoint Brooklyn. He bought an oil-fueled generator two years ago, but he said it was improperly installed and ventilated.</p>
        <p>''I lost money because it was always breaking down,'' he said. The frequent breakdowns damaged computer-controlled cleaning equipment and drove up his repair bills.</p>
        <p>He did not give up, however. In  August, Aphrodite installed two new generators that Mr. Nanas said work perfectly and save him a lot of money. Much of the savings come from using heat from the generators to warm the water for washing machines. Two years ago, when the laundry was operating its seven industrial washers and 15 dry-cleaning machines using a combination of oil, gas and electricity, he said, utility bills averaged $20,000 a month. The  generators will cost $6,000 to $8,000 a month to run, he said.</p>
        <p>There are perhaps 200 businesses of similar size in the metropolitan region that are generating power, said Peter Nelson, president of Alternate Energy, a group in Long Island City, Queens, that designs and develops such projects and will install Mr. Rodriguez's equipment.</p>
        <p>Still, the biggest market for electrical generating systems remains large industrial plants, like chemical manufacturers and soft-drink bottlers, that use as many as four million kilowatt-hours a year, Mr. Nelson said. In comparison, the Associated Supermarket uses 750,000 kilowatt-hours a year. ''We normally approach big businesses, who can save $10,000 or $20,000 a month,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other supermarket owners, wary of a large investment, are waiting to see how Mr. Rodriguez's project works out before they consider generating electricity themselves.</p>
        <p>''I'm still hoping Con Ed rates go down,'' said Albert Diaz, who owns an Associated Supermarket at 132nd Street and Lenox Avenue in Harlem. ''There is no question that the Con Edison bills will put me out of business.''</p>
