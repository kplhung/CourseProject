        <p>DAVIS-Sophie. My dear friend. She will always be remembered for her passion for life and adventurous spirit, her courage and charity. Those who knew her delighted in her wit and wisdom. She graced an otherwise complicated and rigid world with her unaffected nature and easy manner. ''Wherever people gather, her deeds speak her praise.'' My heartfelt condolences to her beloved Leonard, their children and families. May cherished memories offer comfort to all of us who mourn her. Diane</p>
        <p>DAVIS-Sophie. It is with deep personal sadness that I mourn the passing of Sophie Davis-an extraordinary woman of great courage. Her warmth, kindness and love of life were an inspiration to all who knew her. I will miss her always. My sympathy to her husband Leonard, her children Alan and Michael, and their families. Ron Kochman</p>
        <p>DAVIS-Sophie. We extend our deepest sympathies to Leonard, Michael and Alan on the loss of Sophie. She was always there to help those who needed her support and understanding. Michael, David, Susan and David Cameron Fischer</p>
