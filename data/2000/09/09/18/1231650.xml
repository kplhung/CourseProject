        <p>Lynne V. Cheney, the wife of the Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, accused Vice President Al Gore of ''hypocrisy'' today for attending what she described as an ''X-rated'' fund-raiser in New York City last week after he had chided the entertainment industry for marketing inappropriate materials to children.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Cheney, who led the National Endowment for the Humanities in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush and who plays a large role in her husband's campaign, made the accusation on three Sunday morning talk shows.</p>
        <p>It was the latest salvo in a battle that began last week when the Federal Trade Commission released a report that found that adult-rated entertainment was often marketed to children and teenagers. Mr. Gore warned that he would press for federal regulation of the entertainment industry if it did not change its ways. At a Senate hearing on Wednesday, both Mrs. Cheney and her husband's opponent, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, agreed there was a problem but not on how to resolve it.</p>
        <p>Today, Mrs. Cheney criticized Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman for appearing at the fund-raising gala that major figures in the entertainment industry sponsored on Thursday night at Radio City Music Hall, where celebrities performed and spoke and a number of crude jokes were told. The Democratic ticket collected about $6.5 million at the fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>''I mean, there were people making jokes about the report, there were scatological remarks made about people who were concerned about this issue, there were -- well, I guess I can only call them X-rated jokes told with the vice president of the United States sitting there, with the vice president hopeful sitting there,'' she said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''It's quite amazing to me that they would go to such an event, a real X-rated event on the very day that they are condemning people for marketing X-rated materials to our kids.''</p>
        <p>Without commenting on the entertainment at the fund-raiser, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, Douglas Hattaway, suggested that Mrs. Cheney turn her attention to Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee. Mr. Bush, he noted, had served for a decade on the board of directors of Silver Screen Management, a film company that produced a 1986 movie called ''The Hitcher,'' in which a woman's body was ripped in two.</p>
