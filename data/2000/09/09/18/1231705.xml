        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One hopes that your disturbing Sept. 13 news article ''Family Needs Far Exceed the Official Poverty Line'' will shatter the many illusions and distortions about the ''economic boom'' this country is supposedly enjoying.</p>
        <p>Not only is the divide between the rich and the poor widening, but our social programs have also become bureaucratic nightmares for the people they are intended to assist.</p>
        <p>The woman in Queens you mention is a perfect example of how people are penalized by the system for trying to improve their social and economic status: because she began receiving child support from her son's father, her benefits were cut drastically, leaving her worse off than if she had not received child support!</p>
        <p>Poverty is the worst form of violence. It feeds on families, encourages drug abuse and increases crime. Economic boom? For whom?</p>
