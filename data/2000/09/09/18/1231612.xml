        <p>Artists are always invoking the muses and usually overlooking the goddess who (with the help of the ever-ready Zeus) gave birth to them.

        <p>Contemporary art is full of old stories, genres, texts: the words, sounds, look and feel of other periods, other art forms and other artists, living and dead.

Today we think continually of those who were great, good, commercially viable, cheap, awful, arcane or just ubiquitous. And there are so many ways to remember.

        <p>Artists are always invoking the muses and usually overlooking the goddess who (with the help of the ever-ready Zeus) gave birth to them. She was Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, and she is having her day now. Never has art sought so many ways of remembering its past, and never have artists or audiences been exposed to so many pasts. (The Information Age doesn't just expand what we know; it restores to us long-buried knowledge.)</p>
        <p>Contemporary art is full of old stories, genres, texts: the words, sounds, look and feel of other periods, other art forms and other artists, living and dead. The young Stephen Spender began a poem with the words ''I think continually of those who were truly great.'' Today we think continually of those who were great, good, commercially viable, cheap, awful, arcane or just ubiquitous. And there are so many ways to remember. You can dismember art of the past and work with the pieces, juxtapose them with other elements, reinterpret them whole or take a portion (call it a theme) and build new themes, not just variations.</p>
        <p>This last is what happens with a wonderful theater piece called ''And God Created Great Whales,'' produced by the Foundry Theater and playing at the Culture Project in Greenwich Village. It's as if that masterpiece of literary DNA, ''Moby-Dick,'' generated a new strain of life before our eyes. It is a short piece (1 hour 15 minutes), compared with the vast novel (625 pages in my edition), and it has just two performers, a man and a woman in a room. It is part opera, part dialogue, part soliloquy, sprung from a book that spans continents.</p>
        <p>A man, bald, aging and looking confused in a rumpled suit, stands at the center of the stage with one of those old shoebox-shaped tape recorders hanging around his neck. He is Nathan (played by Rinde Eckert, who wrote the music and the script), a composer. He is losing his memory, and the tape recorder contains instructions on how to go about completing his opera, based on ''Moby-Dick.'' Nathan is a writer in a small room, as was Melville, but with a piano rather than a writing desk. He is isolated and suffering acutely as Melville did, fighting to give shape and sound to a vision the world is indifferent to.</p>
        <p>Poised on his couch is a muse (Nora Cole), a figment of his imagination, but to be obeyed in all aesthetic matters, the tape instructs. She wears a bright gown and a funny little hat -- part crown, part bird-plumage -- and she is kind but firm when Nathan's mind and talk wander futilely.</p>
        <p>This is Mr. Eckert's joke, since the last thing Melville wanted or needed was a female muse. But all things are possible in the theater, and so she joins Nathan's Melvillean world to play Queequeg, the harpooner, and other assorted sailors. She is also Olivia, an opera singer Nathan reveres, who wants to descend like an apparition from the sky and sing the final lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eckert is mocking operatic conventions, but he is also teasing Melville. What writer explored masculinity more profoundly and abjured femininity more completely? The jokes are fun. But in the end one is overwhelmed by the power of quest and loss and by the beauty of the music. (All of this fully expressed and embodied through the direction of David Schweizer, the lighting of Kevin Adams -- it's a form of language here -- and by the performances of Mr. Eckert and Ms. Cole).</p>
        <p>Melville used so many kinds of language: sailor talk influenced by race and region, high religious rhetoric, pragmatic everyday observation and dense, ecstatic groupings of metaphor and allusion. We get glorious fragments here: the terrifying Calvinist beauty of a sermon on Jonah, delivered during a storm and the final doomed pursuit of the great white whale. And here are the last words of the last chapter, spoken not by Ishmael but by Olivia, to music so quiet it is a form of stillness: ''Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.''</p>
        <p>Nathan sits in his chair, gazing offstage as if out to sea. His memory is gone, his quest as futile as Ahab's; he too is lost in infinity.</p>
        <p>Let us change moods radically now and consider Marlene Dietrich. Here is another example -- dramatically different to say the least -- of how a contemporary artist invokes what could be called an old text. Let us also move between masculine and feminine nouns when we attempt to describe her. Dietrich was the master, or was it the goddess, of the erotic tease. And of surprising oppositions: she was feral and worldly, Teutonic and exotic, merciless and sentimental. No one looked better draped in a perfectly cut suit or sewn into a flesh-bruising gown.</p>
        <p>Female impersonators have thrived doing Dietrich, but I've seen no woman take her on apart from Madeline Kahn and that fabulous parody she gave us in Mel Brooks's ''Blazing Saddles.'' Madonna has the same hard ambition but not the savoir-faire. And her talent is for being a product. Dietrich knew how to be a product, but she knew how to be a great performer, too.</p>
        <p>The French cabaret singer Michel Hermon is offering a hawk-eyed homage to Dietrich at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel through Oct. 6. He has taken apart Dietrich's style, analyzed each element and reassembled it without using a mask of physical perfection. He has a deliciously brazen style and impeccable stagecraft, which lets him summon up Dietrich without erasing himself. He is partnering her image and memory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hermon saunters into the room and arranges himself by the piano. He wears black tie and tails, with tie and white shirt open. He wears no makeup; instead he offers us a well-shaped, balding head, one small silver earring and very good cheekbones. All cabaret performers should understand the importance of how one stands, but lots of them don't. Nobody understood the power of standing still better than Dietrich, and Mr. Hermon has learned his lessons. His gestures are minimal and exactly timed. His body never confuses stillness with relaxation.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Hermon is best known for his tributes to Edith Piaf, the voice he uses here is German accented, German softened by those all-purpose ''Continental'' tones Dietrich used when speaking or singing in English. Dietrich is all about suggestion, titillation and containment.</p>
        <p>And the songs, to filch Cole Porter's words, are delightful, delicious and de-lovely. We get the voluptuous melodic despair of ''You Go to My Head'' (Gillespie and Coots), a pouty, kittenish ''No Love, No Nothing'' (Warren and Robin) and the fine German songs written for Dietrich by Frederick Hollander, starting with ''Falling in Love Again'' from ''The Blue Angel'' and ending with ''Black Market'' and ''Illusions,'' which she sang as the greedy, jaded postwar German in Billy Wilder's ''Foreign Affair.'' And Mr. Hermon's ''Just a Gigolo'' is the embodiment of the cynicism and narcissism Dietrich made so thoroughly alluring.</p>
        <p>Alluring, yes, and fun. But scary, too, and rightly so. Mr. Hermon is no less ruthless than Dietrich in his smaller way. His performance is an act of cunning, an exposure as well as a tribute. And because he is a man of a certain age, making no attempt to appropriate Dietrich's feminine, calculatedly ageless beauty, he makes us look at the skull beneath the skin. Beneath her beauty lay a brilliant monster. And she was at ease with that. She had created herself piece by piece, and she had nothing to fear from gods or men.</p>
