        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio, after leisurely strolling through two parades in the Bronx and on Long Island, yesterday repeated his promise to ban soft money from his Senate campaign if his opponent would do the same.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters after an Irish festival in Port Washington, N.Y., Mr. Lazio said that he would call off conservative groups that have been paying for ads attacking Hillary Rodham Clinton, his opponent in November's race, if she agreed ''to do what she said she was for, which was to stand up for campaign finance reform.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton, who visited four black churches in Queens yesterday, cited two new anti-Hillary Clinton advertisements as evidence that Mr. Lazio was not being genuine when he tried to get her to sign a pledge during last week's debate.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a further example of him saying one thing and then doing another,'' she said outside the First Baptist Church in Elmhurst, N.Y., where she had delivered an impassioned speech on education, health care, civil rights and popular culture.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said that Mr. Lazio's walking over to her podium during the debate and demanding that she sign a pledge to ban soft money was ''just a debate stunt'' and that she did not believe ''he was ever serious about it.''</p>
        <p>At issue are two recent ads, released since last Wednesday's debate, that attack Mrs. Clinton but were not paid for by Mr. Lazio's campaign. Mrs. Clinton's campaign has argued that both are paid for by soft money.</p>
        <p>Soft money is defined as a contribution to a political party, instead of directly to a candidate. The money is not subject to the same limits on contributions that go directly to candidates. It is supposed to be used for party-building activities, like voter drives, but is often funneled into campaigns through television ads that attack the party's opponents.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Conservative Party of New York began televising an ad that shows a picture of Mrs. Clinton with her hand on her heart and text on the screen that reads, ''If you trust Hillary Clinton maybe you should see your doctor.''</p>
        <p>As a part of any soft money ban, Mrs. Clinton has said she would also like to see a ban on issue-based ads paid for by independent organizations that attack or support given candidates. Over the weekend, the American Conservative Union, a  public policy group in Virginia, ran an ad attacking Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Lazio, who worked his way through crowds of voters at the Irish festival on Long Island and a Jewish street fair in Riverdale in  the Bronx with his wife and daughter, again said that he would not ask soft money contributors to stop until Mrs. Clinton agreed to do the same. ''She said she was for it,'' Mr. Lazio said of his opponent. ''Now she is not doing it, and you can't wiggle out from that.''</p>
        <p>The two also tangled over Mr. Lazio's tax plan, with Mrs. Clinton saying that it had been discredited in several independent analyses as much costlier than the Lazio campaign had suggested. But Mr. Lazio said that it was her tax plan that was flawed, and that it did not eliminate the marriage penalty, as she claims.</p>
        <p>Over all, Mr. Lazio was received warmly at the Irish and Jewish events. And at the churches she visited, Mrs. Clinton put on a command performance, dancing and singing with the choirs, preaching and evoking the memories of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Harriet Tubman.</p>
