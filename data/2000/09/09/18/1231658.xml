        <p>Recall that third-quarter kickoff that whistled in the wind two Januarys ago in Mile High Stadium, the football that fluttered and fell in front of the Jets on that windy afternoon in the 1999 American Football Conference championship game, the one Denver recovered that helped turn a 10-7 Jets advantage into 16 consecutive Broncos points and a 23-10 Jets loss. From that point forward, we can easily acknowledge that most of these current Jets players and coaches have experienced a personal brand of torture. From that point forward -- and little did the Jets know it -- there would be tricky obstacles strewn their way that, collectively, could have swallowed them. Maybe should have swallowed them.</p>
        <p>Four months after that Denver loss and a blown trip to the Super Bowl, the Jets' owner, Leon Hess, died. Four months after that, quarterback Vinny Testaverde was injured in the season opener and was lost for the season. Defensive back Kevin Williams battled a life-threatening bacterial infection during the season. The Jets began with an 0-3 record and sank as far as 1-6 before finishing 8-8. After that, a new owner, Woody Johnson, arrived. Then Parcells quit. Belichick did, too. Groh entered. Keyshawn was traded.</p>

        <p>Recall that third-quarter kickoff that whistled in the wind two Januarys ago in Mile High Stadium, the football that fluttered and fell in front of the Jets on that windy afternoon in the 1999 American Football Conference championship game, the one Denver recovered that helped turn a 10-7 Jets advantage into 16 consecutive Broncos points and a 23-10 Jets loss. From that point forward, we can easily acknowledge that most of these current Jets players and coaches have experienced a personal brand of torture. From that point forward -- and little did the Jets know it -- there would be tricky obstacles strewn their way that, collectively, could have swallowed them. Maybe should have swallowed them.</p>
        <p>Four months after that Denver loss and a blown trip to the Super Bowl, the Jets' owner, Leon Hess, died. Four months after that, quarterback Vinny Testaverde was injured in the season opener and was lost for the season. Defensive back Kevin Williams battled a life-threatening bacterial infection during the season. The Jets began with an 0-3 record and sank as far as 1-6 before finishing 8-8. After that, a new owner, Woody Johnson, arrived. Then Parcells quit. Belichick did, too. Groh entered. Keyshawn was traded.</p>
        <p>A dizzying trip. There was every reason to believe the Jets this season would need a few weeks, a few games, to find their collective heart. To refocus the tribe.</p>
        <p>''You look at all of those things, and especially Keyshawn being traded, and there was the initial feeling among some of us that losing a marquee player like that made you think, 'Hmmm . . . was that a smart move?' '' Jets linebacker Roman Phifer said. ''But we pulled together. And when we won our first two games this year against Green Bay and New England in the fourth quarter like that, the confidence just swelled. That's what you saw today.''</p>
        <p>An ever-growing confident tribe that spun Buffalo for a loop, 27-14, yesterday at Giants Stadium. A tribe riddled with questions that so far has produced answers.</p>
        <p>With a 3-0 record, the Jets thus far are fulfilling a role rarely seen in sports. Off-season turmoil and chaos plus a new head coach nearly always mean slow, sluggish and meandering starts. The Jets, instead, have hit the ground in a peppy and productive stride. They have won three games in a style and manner that indicates the depth of their mentality, their fortitude.</p>
        <p>Apparently, a true tribe.</p>
        <p>Al Groh, the Jets' new coach, tossed that word around in January when he took the job in the most circuitous fashion.</p>
        <p>Groh said then: ''There's a way that we all know, and we know it works. It's not the only way, but it's a way that those of us who have been a part of the tribe have a great deal of confidence in.''</p>
        <p>He was talking about Bill Parcells and his disciples. His players. How to pick them, coach them, coax them, prepare them. How to make a team, an organization, a tribe. How to milk and massage a team, keep it focused. Make it believe.</p>
        <p>''The players here didn't fall into a trap because we have veterans who go out there every day in practice and lead by example, bringing the younger guys and the team along with them,'' said Jets offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott, a 13-year veteran. ''That's kind of what football is all about.''</p>
        <p>Players willing to arrive early and depart late. Willing to conform to the tribe.</p>
        <p>Jets running back Bernie Parmalee said: ''Coach Groh has been in this system for a while. He knows what it is. He gets us prepared, makes sure we stay focused. He pays attention to little things that can get you beat. And he does not physically beat us down during the week; we're fresh on Sundays. He builds the week to a crescendo. He talks all the time about staying focused and grounded. He has us believing that if a team scores 21 points, we'll score 22. He's continued what we started to build at the end of last season.''</p>
        <p>The Jets' special-teams ace, Chris Hayes, uses eagle eyes and ears. His understanding supersedes that of most around him.</p>
        <p>''People don't realize that this is our job,'' Hayes said. ''You've got to deal with surprises, trades, new coaches, schemes, new players; you've got to be strong enough to understand these things happen but you, to a man, still have a job to do. It's like having an unstable house; if you don't deal with it, it will crack up. When you look at Cox and Lewis and Testaverde and Chrebet, I mean, we've got some internal leadership here that this entire team can rally around and fight through anything.</p>
        <p>''Al Groh has been with this core group since Day 1 and I, personally, am glad that Bill Parcells kept it in the family and hired him. Al knows how to lead every one of us. He knows how every guy is going to respond. It's like a puzzle. Buffalo has a good team, but they ran into a team today that is just playing football.''</p>
        <p>Winning football. A tribe.</p>
        <p>If the Jets can stare down Keyshawn and Tampa Bay next, refusing to blink, the foundation for this Jets season will be solidly set. But maybe that has already happened.</p>
        <p>''I saw a team out there today that has toughness and has guys that are hungry like we are,'' Bills defensive end Marcellus Wiley said. ''They have suffered some losses in players and coaches, but, really, it looks like what they really did was gain. Sometimes you're better off as a cohesive unit when you lose some focal points and become more of a herd. It's like the old line about a hand; closed it is a fist, but open just fingers that can easily be broken.''</p>
        <p>One tribe. One beat.</p>
