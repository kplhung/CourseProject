        <p>Thirty minutes had passed since the American professional basketball players bedazzled in their Olympic debut, and the Chinese journalist had one last question for United States Coach Rudy Tomjanovich.</p>
        <p>''Was the reason you gave Ray Allen extended minutes because many of us do not see him on television?'' the man asked.

        <p>Thirty minutes had passed since the American professional basketball players bedazzled in their Olympic debut, and the Chinese journalist had one last question for United States Coach Rudy Tomjanovich.</p>
        <p>''Was the reason you gave Ray Allen extended minutes because many of us do not see him on television?'' the man asked. ''I mean to say, we are lucky in China to have two games broadcast of the Milwaukee Bucks for the whole year. Can you tell the N.B.A. to show us more games of the Milwaukee Bucks and Ray Allen?''</p>
        <p>Tomjanovich, with a mildly embarrassed Allen seated to his right, smiled politely. He knew what the capacity crowd of 8,319 at the Dome in Olympic Park had learned. It is not merely Vince Carter and Kevin Garnett who possess otherworldly skill and athleticism. Even a soft-spoken 25-year-old shooting guard with an angelic smile like Allen can elevate from the dotted line and bring the people to their feet.</p>
        <p>Dream Team 2000 was in the house tonight, starting slowly before scaling China's Great Wall and dunking at whim. The 119-72 spanking was reminiscent of the way past United States men's teams have routed opponents.</p>
        <p>Team USA was not the only show. Watching Yao Ming, the 20-year-old 7-foot-5 Chinese center, reject Carter and Gary Payton in the opening minutes made for great theater. With Yao and the 7-1 Wang Zhizhi, the Chinese raced to a 13-7 lead and had the crowd behind them.</p>
        <p>''Like playing the Heat or the Portland Trail Blazers,'' Garnett said of tonight's game.</p>
        <p>Even Tomjanovich and his staff were on their heels early.</p>
        <p>''The first few minutes of the game, we did not adjust to their size,'' he said. ''Their two centers affected the game by jumping into the middle defensively.''</p>
        <p>About then, the United States gathered itself on defense and drove another sizable wedge between America and international competition.</p>
        <p>Allen made 8 of 10 shots and finished with 21 points in fewer than 22 minutes, delighting the crowd with two scintillating dunks that rivaled the degree of difficulty of those by Carter, who plays for the Toronto Raptors.</p>
        <p>Carter finished with 16 points. Some of his most impressive dunks occurred in the warm-ups, when he practiced spinning 360 degrees, catching the ball off the backboard and slamming.</p>
        <p>All the ill will Carter built up last week in Melbourne during a scuffle with the Aussie hoop legend Andrew Gaze during an exhibition was forgotten tonight in Sydney. Carter badly missed two dunks, but was hardly fretting a day after signing a $30 million endorsement deal with Nike, half of which was used to settle a contract dispute with Puma. ''I told the Nike guy, 'Your shoes made me miss the dunks,' '' he said. '' 'I've got to rethink.' ''</p>
        <p>Enjoying their fame and playing to the crowd, the American men walked onto the court and into the layup line like high school boys trying to impress their girlfriends. They dunked. They laughed. They pointed to friends and family members in the stands and seemed to grasp their place on the world stage.</p>
        <p>Gone were the expectations of being the universe's most accomplished players. Gone was the insecurity of whether they were indeed the best team America could have sent to the Olympics. Suddenly, only an adoring crowd and an inviting rim were in front of them.</p>
        <p>The United States faces Italy on Tuesday in a Group A game.</p>
        <p>As for Gaze and Australia, they are in trouble. The Boomers -- they borrowed the nation's nickname for kangaroos -- were upset by Canada, 101-90, in a Group B game. Steve Nash, the Dallas Mavericks point guard, skittered around and through the Australian defense. He finished with 15 assists, while severely hurting the Aussies' shot for a medal. Luc Longley was outplayed by Todd MacCulloch.</p>
        <p>Unless Canada loses two of its remaining four preliminary games, the chances of Australia earning a No. 3 seeding in the quarterfinals of the 12-team tournament are long. Given that Team USA is a lock to be seeded No. 1, a No. 4 seeding would ensure an Australian matchup against the United States in the semifinals rather than in the final. And with Yugoslavia and Russia still in the way, that is far from a certainty.</p>
        <p>The Americans ran out to a 60-38 halftime lead on China and sent Yao and Wang, a second-round draft pick of the Mavericks in 1999, to the bench in foul trouble. Yao fouled out with 18 minutes 50 seconds left in the second half. Wang finished with 13 points to lead the Chinese.</p>
        <p>Tomjanovich praised both big men afterward, but was careful not to say they were ready for the National Basketball Association. There was much talk about whether teams like China were closing the gap on America. But at least for now, N.B.A. players are still supernovas.</p>
        <p>''We watch the N.B.A. broadcasts, and their skills are very much more comprehensive,'' the Chinese forward Sun Jun said through a translator. ''We often try to imitate them. But our physical condition does not allow us to emulate them physically. We are happy to learn from them.''</p>
