        <p>New Yorkers seem to have a warrior mentality even when it comes to contaminated water.</p>
        <p>As reports of illness from possibly tainted bottled water rose to 22 this weekend, people in the city took the incidents in stride, if not with a little bravado. ''We're New Yorkers -- we're strong,'' said Bill Finnegan, who bought two liters of Poland Spring from a street vendor near Central Park. ''A little poison in the water won't kill us.''</p>
        <p>In Times Square yesterday afternoon, nearly every other passer-by seemed to be clutching bottled water  like the latest fashion accessory. Clerks at delicatessens and grocery stores in the area rolled their eyes and laughed when asked whether sales of bottled water have dipped.</p>
        <p>''Oh, God, nobody cares,'' said Chhinda Singh, a clerk at Nick's Gourmet Deli at West 49th Street and Seventh Avenue. ''Everybody drinks water like before. I drink it myself.''</p>
        <p>With the recent ban on alcohol sales at parades, vendors at the African-American Day Parade in Harlem yesterday said they were selling more bottled water than in years past. Down in Little Italy, at the annual Feast of San Gennaro, vendors also reported uninhibited sales of bottled water.</p>
        <p>Revelers in Harlem snatched up bottles by the armful, including brands like Poland Spring and Aquafina that are reported to have been contaminated. ''Do I look worried to you?'' said Allison Browe, holding four bottles of Naya spring water. ''I'm giving these to my little kids. They're hot and thirsty.''</p>
        <p>Waiting in line to catch the Sunday matinee of ''Jekyll and Hyde'' on West 45th Street near Broadway, Tomas and Josefine Fiore of Westchester sipped from bottles of Evian they had bought at a nearby deli.</p>
        <p>The Fiores said they had not been paying attention to news reports about the bottled water contamination. ''I think it's blown way out of proportion -- oh, wait, wait,'' said Mr. Fiore, suddenly spitting and coughing violently as his wife patted his back. ''Heh, heh. Just kidding.''</p>
        <p>Even the mayor seemed calm about the most recent reports of sickness from bottled water and dismissed some of the complaints. The police say that one of the recent complaints is a false report.</p>
        <p>''I can't analyze human psychology,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said at Family Sports Day 2000, an event at Chelsea Piers. ''I don't know why people get intrigued by things like this and try to copycat.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani reminded New Yorkers again to sniff their bottled water before drinking it.</p>
        <p>Maged Elhenawy, a street vendor outside the Martin Beck Theater on West 45th Street and Eighth Avenue, said a handful of his customers have hesitated before drinking bottled water. They open the bottle, take a sniff and sip, he said.</p>
        <p>''But even those people, when it looks like nothing's happening, shrug their shoulders and gulp it down,'' he said. ''If it's hot, they will come. Nobody really cares about that kind of stuff when they're thirsty.''</p>
