        <p>Bloomberg Television is announcing a distribution deal today with Time Warner Cable that could eventually more than double the number of households its cable television channel reaches in the United States.</p>
        <p>The deal, the terms of which Bloomberg declined to disclose, gives Bloomberg access to 12.6 million new subscribers in cities like Los Angeles; Milwaukee; Tampa, Fla.; and Charlotte, N.C.</p>
        <p>Currently, Bloomberg's television operation, which provides 24-hour financial news, has a much wider reach abroad than it does in the United States. While the company's television channel reaches about 11 million domestic households, including some New York City cable customers, it reaches 40 million English-speaking European households and 200 million households over all.</p>
        <p>Though the deal could double its domestic reach, Bloomberg will not have immediate access to the new households. The company will still have to reach agreements with each regional Time Warner Cable provider, and it will have access to only those Time Warner customers that have been switched over to digital cable service.</p>
        <p>''Our view is that we're a channel that's designed for digital because of the interactive capability,'' said Michael Morrison, a Bloomberg executive who oversees the company's cable distribution deals. ''Individuals can customize the screen, whether for stock quotes or other analytics.''</p>
        <p>Derek Baine, an analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, said: ''It's a big deal in the long term because we're expecting big growth in digital cable. In the short term, it's not going to have much impact.''</p>
        <p>About 16.3 percent of the nation's 68.1 million cable subscribers are projected to be using digital connections by the end of the year, Mr. Baine said. By 2005, he expects the number of digitally connected users to rise to 63 percent of the overall cable market.</p>
