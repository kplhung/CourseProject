        <p>For his next act, Mark Burnett, television's hottest producer thanks to ''Survivor,'' wants to send an endurance-contest winner into outer space.</p>
        <p>But a lot of television executives think that is far from his most radical idea.</p>
        <p>Instead, they point to an agreement Mr. Burnett just reached with NBC. Under this deal, Mr. Burnett will get a share of the advertising revenue of his new show -- called ''Destination Mir'' because the winner will ride a rocket to the old Russian space station. NBC executives acknowledge that this is the first time the network has ever agreed to share advertising revenue with a producer of entertainment programs.</p>
        <p>Executives at other networks pounced on the announcement, saying that NBC was inviting demands for similar revenue-sharing deals with producers of other hit series, like John Wells of ''E.R.'' and ''The West Wing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burnett said that, in contrast to other producers, he literally pitches his shows to advertisers himself, and his space show, like ''Survivor,'' will have openings for advertisers to associate themselves directly with the show, including opportunities to have their products used in the broadcast.</p>
        <p>Without citing figures, Mr. Burnett said he had made financial presentations to all four networks, and NBC signed on to all his terms.</p>
        <p>In reality, Mr. Burnett has already shared in a network's ad revenue.</p>
        <p>On ''Survivor,'' he took home 50 percent of at least a portion of the cash CBS piled up. Whatever the exact breakdown, the experience proved to Mr. Burnett that he was in position to deal himself in on the advertising revenue on his space show.</p>
        <p>''Destination Mir,'' which will put a group of American would-be astronauts through the rigors of space preparation under Russian trainers, will not be taped until fall 2001, Mr. Burnett said. Before that he will deliver both ''Survivor 2'' and ''Survivor 3'' to CBS.</p>
        <p>At the moment, he is pondering locations for ''Survivor 3'' (he is leaning toward ''finding another island'') while poring over the qualifications of the last 50 contestants -- out of an initial pool of 49,000 -- for ''Survivor 2,'' which will be set in the Australian outback, filmed in October, and broadcast starting in January.</p>
        <p>Asked whether his deal with CBS would bring him a share of ad revenue, Mr. Burnett only said, ''We're in discussions.''</p>
