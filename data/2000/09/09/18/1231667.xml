      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Part of the lifetime pleasure of playing and following sports is the measuring of one's own athletic trajectory against a steadily shifting peak of performance. There is hardly a lunchtime basketball player or weekend golfer or early-morning jogger who does not quietly assess the effect of the years, for better or worse, on his or her game or condition. We look back at our best selves, but we also look to the athletes who redefine what a best self might mean -- to the individuals who virtually reinvent the games they play. Sports may seem like the pursuit of transcendence, but they are also the accepting of obsolescence. That is what the old saying -- records are meant to be broken -- means.</p>
        <p>You can see this vividly in the records of the Olympic Summer Games. Over the 20th century, times decreased, heights rose, distances lengthened. Much of this is attributable to changes in human conditioning that once seemed basic -- better nutrition, a clearer understanding of physiology -- but have grown more and more arcane and sophisticated as the years pass. Athletes prepare now with a precision that is simply stunning, in part because they have tools for observing and analyzing their performance that they never had before. If you could somehow see a time-lapse image of most of the events in the Summer Olympics from the beginning in 1896 to the present, you would see a steady morphing of athletes' bodies to today's extremes of conditioning. But you would also see a steady transformation of the equipment that makes their performances possible.</p>

        <p>You can see this vividly in the records of the Olympic Summer Games. Over the 20th century, times decreased, heights rose, distances lengthened. Much of this is attributable to changes in human conditioning that once seemed basic -- better nutrition, a clearer understanding of physiology -- but have grown more and more arcane and sophisticated as the years pass. Athletes prepare now with a precision that is simply stunning, in part because they have tools for observing and analyzing their performance that they never had before. If you could somehow see a time-lapse image of most of the events in the Summer Olympics from the beginning in 1896 to the present, you would see a steady morphing of athletes' bodies to today's extremes of conditioning. But you would also see a steady transformation of the equipment that makes their performances possible.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most obvious example of that equipment change in this Olympics is the bodysuits that swimmers are wearing in Sydney, including many of the record-setting Australians and Americans who won gold medals over the weekend. Suddenly swimmers, in whose heavy, bare limbs we could almost see the weight of the water, stand on their starting blocks covered in synthetic sharkskin looking as sleek, if not yet as vivid, as downhill skiers. It is hard to say whether these suits reveal bodily form or conceal it. Swimmers claim the suits enhance performance, and we should all be grateful for one performance enhancer that does not take the form of illegal steroids or human growth hormones or other exotic substances.</p>
        <p>Perhaps someday there will be a retro Olympics, a Games in which men and women dress as their predecessors did in 1896 and use the same equipment. But would even retro Olympians choose to train in the same ways and eat the same diets as former Olympians once did? It seems unlikely. Where sports are concerned, the human body changes in part because the world around the body changes, and there is no stopping change.</p>
