        <p>Orlando Hernandez is inventive by nature, but he still managed to surprise a few people with a new pitch in Saturday's complete-game victory over the Cleveland Indians.</p>
        <p>Hernandez, the Yankee right-hander who appeared to lose confidence in his changeup last month, remodeled his grip and vividly extracted more movement in the pitch against Cleveland. Hernandez's changeup used to move mostly vertically, north and south on a compass. But against the Indians, it dived away from left-handed batters, northwest to southeast.</p>
        <p>Jim Thome struck out on a Hernandez changeup in a pivotal moment of Game 4 of the 1998 American League Championship Series, and when he struck out on a changeup Saturday, he noticed the difference. El Duque's new changeup, Thome said, ''really had a lot of fade to it; it really tails away from you.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez holds his new changeup with the ball tucked underneath his right ring finger, with his middle finger split far from it. From the center-field camera angle, it looked as if El Duque was setting up to throw a split-fingered fastball, and the ball had movement similar to David Cone's splitter, down and away.</p>
        <p>But it's a changeup, developed at the suggestion of Billy Connors, the interim pitching coach who showed the same grip to Dwight Gooden.</p>
        <p>''It certainly had some action on it,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager. ''It was like a screwball. I saw a replay of the one he struck Thome out on and that was pretty impressive.''</p>
        <p>One scout who is trailing the Yankees said, ''That pitch is going to be a big weapon for him against left-handed batters.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez threw lots of fastballs inside to left-handed batters, opening the game by buzzing Cleveland's leadoff hitter, Kenny Lofton, with a fastball. That helped to set up his new changeup: Left-handed batters had to be cognizant of pitches inside and had trouble with the changeup down and away. Going into Saturday's game, left-handed batters were hitting .295 against Hernandez, but the Cleveland hitters who batted left-handed -- including the likes of Roberto Alomar, Lofton and Thome -- went 3 for 21 (.143).</p>
        <p>After knocking down Lofton in the first inning, Hernandez brushed him back in the sixth before drilling him on the right hip. Scouts and some participants had no doubt that Hernandez, who has never engaged in brushback battles since joining the Yankees, intended to hit Lofton, although no one could figure out why. There is no apparent history of bad blood, as there is any time Jaret Wright pitches against the Yankees.</p>
        <p>''We were all asking ourselves what that was all about,'' said one player. ''Maybe he just doesn't like Kenny.''</p>
        <p>There is this, too: Lofton had been 6 for 11 against Hernandez. He went 0 for 3 on Saturday.</p>
