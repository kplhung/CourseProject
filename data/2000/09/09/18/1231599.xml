        <p>It is wonderful to be the new gunslinger in town, young and unafraid to speak your mind. Take Daniel Peres, the 28-year-old editor in chief of Details magazine, which after a four-month hiatus and an overhaul  will arrive on newsstands this week.</p>
        <p>''Men's magazines have all become either one thing or the other,'' he said with a wave of his hand at a lunch last week to celebrate the new magazine (and a DKNY men's cologne) at the Four Seasons in Manhattan. To Mr. Peres, they are all about frat-house carousing, babes and drinking, or they are about retirement, golf courses, how to carve milk-fed veal -- ''basically, your Dad's magazine,'' Mr. Peres said. ''Boring.''</p>

        <p>It is wonderful to be the new gunslinger in town, young and unafraid to speak your mind. Take Daniel Peres, the 28-year-old editor in chief of Details magazine, which after a four-month hiatus and an overhaul  will arrive on newsstands this week.</p>
        <p>''Men's magazines have all become either one thing or the other,'' he said with a wave of his hand at a lunch last week to celebrate the new magazine (and a DKNY men's cologne) at the Four Seasons in Manhattan. To Mr. Peres, they are all about frat-house carousing, babes and drinking, or they are about retirement, golf courses, how to carve milk-fed veal -- ''basically, your Dad's magazine,'' Mr. Peres said. ''Boring.''</p>
        <p>''The men's books now are all about clutter, and we are not,'' he said later. ''They all work on the assumption that the male attention span is as long as that of a gnat, and that is not true.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres is treading in some potentially perilous territory. After all, he does not have a known track record as an editor, so who is he to criticize the entire crop of men's magazines? And is he gambling  heavily in betting that he can find 400,000 literate young men who are also interested in fashion?</p>
        <p>The frequently remade Details, a magazine published by Fairchild Publications for men in their 20's and 30's, has a long and varied history, although it has always served at some level as the arbiter of the young male id. It was founded in 1982 as a downtown style magazine, and after Conde Nast bought it in 1988, it was remade into a magazine for young men that focused, variously, on music, pop culture, fashion and, most recently, women. And despite the fact that the magazine's circulation has been reduced, Mr. Peres must make the new Details relevant and exciting in a field that is already crowded with successful foes like Maxim, Stuff, GQ, and even Esquire, which was once virtually left for dead.</p>
        <p>Think of Mr. Peres as the 20-something, spiky-haired newcomer sauntering into the corral under the eyes of his colleagues -- all older, all more experienced, all probably battling the bellies that Mr. Peres has not yet developed and all sort of irked by his presence (''Why didn't they just let it die?'' snarled one competing publisher). Their knives sharpened, they are waiting for him to make his first misstep.</p>
        <p>The former Paris bureau chief of W magazine -- also published by Advance Publications' Fairchild unit -- Mr. Peres arrived in New York four months ago with a summons to have dinner with Patrick McCarthy, the Fairchild editorial director, and an overnight bag.</p>
        <p>''And I have not been back to Paris since,'' Mr. Peres said.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. McCarthy's watchful eye, Mr. Peres has created an intriguing new beast: a sort of warts-and-all fashion magazine, with derivative whispers of Vanity Fair, Esquire and even the women's titles W and In Style. Its target audience: the sophisticated urban 25-to-35-year-old who ''is worried,'' Mr. Peres said. ''He's worried about things like do I mousse my hair? Do I wear flat-fronts or pleats?''</p>
        <p>A far cry from the frat-house monthly it most recently was, the new monthly magazine also clearly favors fallibility over glossy perfection. A fashion feature shows Internet executives in the saggy clothes they wear to the office. A piece on Viagra does not promote it as a cool wonder drug but emphasizes young men's fears of becoming addicted to it. An article about Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, suggests that, despite his wealth, he is still a geek.</p>
        <p>The problem for Details is not one of sensibility, but whether there is enough room for it in the ever-growing and already-crowded marketplace for men's magazines. After all, even when its circulation was 580,000, there was not enough room for it at Conde Nast. The new guaranteed rate base, which is the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, is now 400,000, said the magazine's publisher, William J. Wackermann.</p>
        <p>Competing magazine publishers and editors are, of course, skeptical about the magazine and about their youthful new foe. David Granger, editor in chief of Esquire published by Hearst Magazines, a unit of the Hearst Corporation, said he was offended by Mr. Peres's remarks about the Dad-magazine culture.</p>
        <p>''That is patently untrue,'' Mr. Granger said. ''There is nothing in Esquire about golf or retirement or milk-fed veal. Clearly, he is not very familiar with the men's field.''</p>
        <p>Rob Gregory, publisher of the Wenner Media magazine Men's Journal, described the seemingly unending reinvention and search for self as damaging to any title's reputation with readers. ''It is a bit ridiculous,'' he said. ''It has become the Shirley MacLaine of magazines. It keeps reincarnating itself.''</p>
        <p>And Art Cooper, editor in chief of GQ, which is also published by Conde Nast, said he had no comment about the magazine. Neither did GQ's publisher, Thomas A. Florio. But one staff member said Mr. Cooper was ''literally rubbing his hands in anticipation'' of the new rival on the block.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres, who grew up in Baltimore and graduated from New York University in 1993, is happy to take shots at old traditions. He pointed to an article in the new issue about Hunter S. Thompson, which began, ''Hunter S. Thompson has a toothache'' -- a line reminiscent of the first line in a famous essay titled ''Frank Sinatra Has a Cold'' by Gay Talese, that appeared in Esquire magazine in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, but we got the interview,'' Mr. Peres said. (Zing!) He pointed out that the article concentrates on the potentially frail side of Mr. Thompson and does not glamorize his arguably reckless life.</p>
        <p>''This is not all about Hunter Thompson, 'Oh wow, gonzo star,' '' Mr. Peres said. ''This is about him kicking drugs, about him being human. Is he a flake?'' In a pointed reference to Rolling Stone magazine and its founder Jann Wenner's friendship with Mr. Thompson, Mr. Peres added, ''And since he's not best friends with the editor, we do not have to do a big annual puff piece on him.'' (Pow!)</p>
        <p>Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Wenner said he had no comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres said he also dislikes virtually all the food articles in other men's magazines.</p>
        <p>''I call them culinary masturbation,'' he said, referring to what he described as painfully earnest foodie essays or complicated recipes that invariably call for ''hand-grown organic yams.''</p>
        <p>(Alan Richman, the food writer for GQ, said, ''I would not know an organic yam if the bugs on it bit me.'')</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres, in saying he will make a point of moving away from the beer-and-babes formula that has worked so well for competitors, was also clear that the new Details would not alienate gay readers.</p>
        <p>''It is offensive to men and to women and to gay men -- and, yes, they are our readers also -- to have to see nipples every time there's a picture of a woman,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''You have to consider the fact that it is no longer gay to think about the shape of a lamp in your apartment,'' Mr. Peres said, using his fingers to put quotation marks around the word ''gay.'' ''It is no longer fey to think about clothes. Young men are more vain than they ever have been.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres's cheekiness is on par with the nose-thumbing attitude of the magazine itself, which appears to be part of its editorial fabric at even the corporate level. The magazine is considered by the industry to be a litmus test of the somewhat competitive relationship between Fairchild and its sister entity Conde Nast under the Advance Publications roof.  Details certainly takes opportunities to thumb its nose at Conde Nast, its former publisher: The spine, for example, reads ''Details: The New Fair Child.'' On the cover, directly beneath the magazine's title are the bold words ''First Issue.'' What does James Truman, a former Details editor and editorial director of Conde Nast, who guided the magazine through some of its successful previous years -- think of that?</p>
        <p>''That I could not tell you,'' Mr. Peres said. (Mr. Truman could not be reached for comment.)</p>
        <p>Mary Berner, Fairchild's chief executive, said of Mr. Peres and his brash cover line: ''Good for him. He shouldn't care. He is just being honest.''</p>
