        <p>We waited a long time for the public to get interested in this election, but now in southern Ohio you can see the signs. Literally. The lawns are full of ads for candidates who want to be the next congressman or state representative. This must be what they mean when they talk about grass-roots politics.</p>
        <p>The signs are extremely important, says John Cranley, a 26-year-old Democratic Congressional candidate. ''That's what I see as the uniqueness of the district. People will put a sign up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cranley, a recent graduate of Harvard Law School, is the youngest person running for the House of Representatives this year. MTV is following him around, doing a documentary about the race. The constant presence of the cameras has been a big help in recruiting campaign volunteers. ''They've got a lot of very intimate footage,'' Mr. Cranley says. ''They come when I get up and say, 'Are you going to puke this morning?' Which I do a lot. The stress is enormous.''</p>
        <p>There are only a couple of dozen Congressional races in this country that the pros regard as up in the air. At this point, the First Congressional District of Ohio isn't one of them. Last time around, the popular mayor of Cincinnati, Roxanne Qualls, ran against the incumbent, a conservative Republican named Steve Chabot, and she got buried in the conservative Catholic neighborhoods to the west of the city. Mr. Cranley, who is Catholic, opposed to abortion and from the west side, figures he can win if he can manage to lose the district where he grew up by only 3 to 1.</p>
        <p>My sister used to baby-sit for Mr. Cranley when he was a toddler, so she gave him a party the other day, in a neighborhood where Ms. Qualls got a grand total of 16 percent of the vote. Throwing a meet-the-candidate party is akin to a corporal work of mercy. The country is full of people who are dying to tell you why they'd be a better representative/state legislator/road commissioner than the entrenched incumbent. There is a severe shortage, however, of places for them to give their pitch. At the Democratic convention, Representative Harold Ford, the keynote speaker, recalled the critical moment when he discovered the concept of kindergarten graduations as a turning point in his political career.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cranley understands. ''Church festivals are my life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Due to the shortage of swing voters in the area, half the people in attendance at the party were Republican friends of my parents. They sat listening as Mr. Cranley denounced Mr. Chabot for voting against nutrition programs for pregnant women, infants and children.</p>
        <p>''These are women who opted not to have abortions. To be pro-life we have to be consistent,'' he said. Mr. Cranley's passionate defense of anti-poverty programs may not have had much impact on the Republican seniors, but it did soften one Democratic woman, who dropped her plan to yell at him for being anti-choice.</p>
        <p>Several guests volunteered to put up signs, but in this neighborhood people will commit their lawns before they commit their votes. I don't know if Mr. Cranley has a shot at the House seat -- Mr. Chabot seems pretty energetic. But it's heartening to know we still have graduates coming out of Harvard Law worrying about the WIC program and the earned-income tax credit.</p>
        <p>People in Ohio expect a lot of attention at election time, as befits their standing as residents of a swing state. There was a certain amount of hurt feelings the other day when George W. Bush flew here for a fund-raiser at the home of a wealthy friend and didn't stop to do any campaigning.</p>
        <p>In New York, we're used to the idea that Mr. Bush and Al Gore see us as the motorcade route between La Guardia Airport and the Hilton banquet hall. Wham, bam, traffic jam. But Ohio needs more tender handling.</p>
        <p>A deeply unscientific survey of conservative Catholic senior citizens on the western side of Cincinnati suggests the most popular guy on either ticket is Joe Lieberman. ''I liked him even better before he got partisan,'' said one of the men. The male Republicans seem happy enough with Mr. Bush, but the women are disappointed they can't fall in love with him the way they did with Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had better hang around next time he swings through. The signs are not all good.</p>
