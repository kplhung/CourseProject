        <p>Left tackle Jason Fabini timed his arrival in the Jets' locker room today perfectly -- just as reporters were leaving.</p>
        <p>Fabini's reluctance to hold an audience with inquiring minds was understandable. In only his second career start at left tackle after playing most of his first two pro seasons on the right side, he had what must have been one of the most miserable days of his career against Green Bay Sunday, being called for four penalties for a total of 35 yards. One of the fouls -- for a blatant trip -- nullified a touchdown pass from Vinny Testaverde to Wayne Chrebet on the Jets' first drive of the third quarter. Fabini was benched when the Jets took over the ball with 11 minutes 14 seconds left in the game.</p>

        <p>Left tackle Jason Fabini timed his arrival in the Jets' locker room today perfectly -- just as reporters were leaving.</p>
        <p>Fabini's reluctance to hold an audience with inquiring minds was understandable. In only his second career start at left tackle after playing most of his first two pro seasons on the right side, he had what must have been one of the most miserable days of his career against Green Bay Sunday, being called for four penalties for a total of 35 yards. One of the fouls -- for a blatant trip -- nullified a touchdown pass from Vinny Testaverde to Wayne Chrebet on the Jets' first drive of the third quarter. Fabini was benched when the Jets took over the ball with 11 minutes 14 seconds left in the game.</p>
        <p>After the game, Coach Al Groh would not say that Fabini would start against New England next Monday. While expressing confidence in Fabini today, Groh would still not say whether Fabini would start again. Groh has the luxury of the former starter Jumbo Elliott, who returns from a one-game suspension, backing up his good friend Fabini.</p>
        <p>Today, Fabini's assessment of his performance was simple: ''Just have to play better next week.''</p>
        <p>Groh said he saw nothing in practice last week to indicate that Fabini, who is also returning from a season-ending knee injury, was struggling with his new position, which he moved to after Elliott retired at the end of last season. Fabini's transition, presumably, went smoothly, and when Elliott unretired, he returned as Fabini's backup.</p>
        <p>''Jason is a very prideful player,'' Groh said. ''I've got a lot of confidence in him. I think he'll get these things righted. Players have to understand, it doesn't matter how many dominating blocks you make in the game. If you get those kinds of penalties, you can't say you played a good game.</p>
        <p>''On a play-to-play basis, Jason actually had a lot of good plays. But he had those really bad plays. They were technical things. I think we can get to work and alleviate that problem. But a magic wand isn't going to eliminate it. I'll watch practice this week, but I'm not going to bury Jason here.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Mawae, a Pro Bowl center last season, recalled that early in his career, when he played in Seattle, he endured games so poor that he used to leave the locker room crying.</p>
        <p>''Everybody has a bad day,'' he said. ''You don't write Pulitzer Prize-winning articles every day. You can't expect Jason to have Pro Bowl days every day. Jason is going to bounce back and he's going to be in the starting lineup and nobody is going to think anything about it. You just put those games behind you, you learn from them, get better from them and tell yourself next week it's not going to happen. You just deal with it and say, 'Next week I'll be a better football player than I was last week.' ''</p>
