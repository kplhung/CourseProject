        <p>Today ends the second straight summer travel season of chronic flight delays and cancellations across the United States. Yet despite the expenditure of billions -- and repeated warnings over the last decade that the air traffic system was approaching gridlock -- there is still no relief in sight for frustrated fliers.</p>
        <p>Indeed, most experts now believe that delays, which have risen nearly 50 percent the last five years, will become worse, not better. The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs the air traffic system, predicts that by 2010 the number of airline passengers will rise 59 percent, to one billion. About 70 percent of that increase is expected to occur at the country's 28 largest airports.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there is anything on the drawing board right now that you can say with any credibility is the answer,'' said Kenneth M. Mead, inspector general of the Transportation Department, parent agency of the F.A.A.</p>
        <p>''We wish there was a silver bullet,'' said Jane Garvey, the F.A.A. administrator, ''but there is not.''</p>
        <p>The story of how the nation's air transportation system reached its current crisis can be traced back to one of the government's most successful economic initiatives -- airline deregulation -- and to one of its longest and most expensive bureaucratic blunders: the F.A.A.'s ill-fated attempts to develop a new air traffic control system.</p>
        <p>It is a tale that involves so many disparate interests shouting one another down -- from grass-roots organizations to large corporations to municipalities to labor unions -- that politicians in Congress and the White House have simply let the system drift for years.</p>
        <p>A recent review by Mr. Mead's office found that the F.A.A. and the Transportation Department do not even have the tools to determine the precise causes of most delays.</p>
        <p>And so the airlines blame the F.A.A., charging that the hours planes sit idling on runways and the countless appointments missed by passengers because of an antiquated air traffic control system cost more than $5 billion last year alone. The F.A.A. counters that airlines knowingly schedule more takeoffs and landings at major airports than the system can handle. Both attack Congress for not appropriating enough money to fix the system, and localities for preventing the building of new runways at congested airports.</p>
        <p>''It's gotten down to a big finger-pointing contest,'' said Thomas Brantley, national vice president of the Professional Airways System Specialists, the union of technicians who maintain the F.A.A.'s air traffic control equipment. ''The reality is, everybody's got blame to share.''</p>
        <p>There are other factors at work, too. Eight years of economic growth has encouraged airlines to add flights, even as consumers complain about high fares. An unusual spate of thunderstorms this summer frequently left controllers with few avenues to reroute air traffic. And United Airlines, the world's largest carrier, was forced to cancel more than 20,000 flights over the summer, largely because of labor disputes, adding to the burden on passengers and other airlines.</p>
        <p>Still, critics say that thunderstorms and the growth in passenger demand are predictable events that the system should handle without passengers' waiting half a day or more to reach their destinations. And those passengers are seething.</p>
        <p>''It's not like we are having typhoons,'' said Sharon Mantel, a drug saleswoman heading to Chicago from LaGuardia Airport one morning in July. ''Shouldn't technology be able to handle this? It's not like the airplane was invented yesterday.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the answer to today's gridlock, whenever it comes, will involve new technology that lets controllers track more planes in the sky -- and, possibly, new economics that let market forces allocate the system's scarce resources.</p>
        <p>Any changes, however, must guarantee the same high level of safety enjoyed now. For with all its flaws -- and despite a few deadly collisions on the ground -- the national air system has been remarkably successful at keeping big jets from flying into one another.</p>
        <p>The Transformation  With Deregulation,  Sweeping Changes</p>
        <p>A generation ago, life was much simpler for airlines and air traffic controllers. Government regulators told the airlines when and where they could fly and how much they could charge. Bureaucrats made sure every city was served and that popular cities had no more service than they could handle.</p>
        <p>The drawback was that flying was expensive, the preserve of an elite.</p>
        <p>The deregulation of the industry in 1978 transformed air travel into mass transportation. It also hit the industry like an earthquake. Venerable carriers disappeared; low-fare upstarts rose and fell. The survivors established so-called hubs at major airports, increasing their efficiency by flying passengers in, transferring them to other planes, and flying them on to their final destinations.</p>
        <p>Today, the airline industry carries three times as many passengers as it did in 1978 at average fares that are 40 percent lower, adjusting for inflation.</p>
        <p>But while the industry was transformed, the air traffic control system has remained virtually unchanged. At its heart are a collection of ground-based navigation beacons and radar stations that divide the 3.5 million square miles of airspace over the continental United States into aerial highways over which most airplanes are dispatched single-file like railroad cars.</p>
        <p>Because radar -- developed for the military in World War II -- is arguably better at spotting attack planes than tracking friendly jets, the F.A.A. has long stipulated that planes flying between cities be separated by at least 5 miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically. That clogs the routes taken by the 20,000 scheduled flights a day.</p>
        <p>''A bunch of guys with slide rules, pocket protectors and tape on their glasses figured this out a long time ago,'' said William Blackmer, the top safety and technology expert at the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union for 15,000 F.A.A. controllers.</p>
        <p>When a storm hits, controllers begin closing off highways and spacing planes farther apart, leading to long delays on the ground. Even when the weather is perfect, departures are not spread evenly throughout the day; for a hub to be successful, planes must arrive and depart in waves. Airlines also try to provide frequent service from their hubs for the convenience of business travelers, who pay the highest fares.</p>
        <p>The irony is that inviting everybody to travel when they prefer means fewer planes arrive or depart on time. Mr. Mead, the Transportation Department's inspector general, found that airlines frequently schedule flights in numbers that would be beyond an airport's maximum capacity even in perfect weather, let alone on bad weather days, when departure and arrival rates can be cut in half.</p>
        <p>For example, at Newark International Airport one day earlier this year, Mr. Mead found that airlines had scheduled more planes to take off than could be handled by the tower for four hours during the day. Last year, Newark had the second highest number of delays recorded by the F.A.A., after O'Hare International Airport at Chicago.</p>
        <p>Continental Airlines, which uses Newark as a hub, said it had spread out arrivals and departures to stay below the airport's capacity throughout the day. It has also replaced smaller airplanes with larger ones, to keep takeoffs and landings flat while accommodating more passengers.</p>
        <p>''If we scheduled fewer flights, then people couldn't travel,'' said Greg Brenneman, Continental's president. ''It is not incumbent on the airlines to be the least common denominator here. It is incumbent on the government to have a system that allows people to travel when they want to travel.''</p>
        <p>Several government commissions have urged expanded use of secondary airports to ease the strain on the system. Southwest Airlines, the country's seventh-largest carrier, has had enormous success bypassing major airports, providing frequent service between cities like Baltimore and Providence or Dallas and Houston. That has helped Southwest achieve the best on-time performance of any major carrier. But the other airlines continue to favor the hub system.</p>
        <p>The airlines would like to see busy airports enlarged; that is what both United and American Airlines would prefer at O'Hare, for instance, where they operate hubs. But residents near O'Hare oppose any expansion. Representative Henry J. Hyde Jr., their Republican congressman, has joined with Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., a Democrat from Chicago, to back construction of a new airport south of the city -- but the airlines have said they would not fly there.</p>
        <p>Most other major airports also have difficulty expanding, either because there is no space, as is the case at Newark and LaGuardia Airport, or because of local opposition. From 1995 through 1999, only three new runways were put into service at the 28 biggest airports, according to the Transportation Department.</p>
        <p>The introduction of smaller 50-  and 70-seat jets has also increased congestion. These so-called regional jets are rapidly replacing propeller-driven planes on many commuter routes and are much preferred by passengers. But unlike prop planes, which fly at lower altitudes and can take off and land on shorter runways, regional jets act just as big jets do, adding to the competition for space on the ground and in the air.</p>
        <p>In 1995, there were just 35 regional jets in the nation's fleet. Last year, there were 407. The Transportation Department estimates the number will grow 25 percent annually, comprising 19 percent of the total domestic fleet by 2011.</p>
        <p>The New System  Plan With Promise  Triples Its Cost</p>
        <p>The growth in air traffic was supposed to be easily handled by a sophisticated system that the F.A.A. began developing in 1981. In the wake of that year's air traffic controllers' strike, when all 11,000 controllers were fired by President Reagan, the F.A.A. began looking for a system that would handle more traffic with fewer controllers.</p>
        <p>What came to be known as the Advanced Automation System, was the centerpiece of a 10-year, $12 billion plan to modernize air traffic control. Though the overall system of radar and navigation beacons was unchanged, the plan promised to save billions of dollars by enabling controllers to ''work smarter, not harder,'' the F.A.A. administrator at the time said.</p>
        <p>It turned out to be a gigantic white elephant. In 1994, after its cost had tripled, the system's capabilities were shown to be much less than promised and it was still 10 years from completion, the F.A.A. decided to scale back the project dramatically. The money wasted, according to the General Accounting Office, amounted to $2.8 billion.</p>
        <p>The failure was just the most dramatic example of the F.A.A.'s storied incompetence in procurement. For years, the agency has been rebuked by members of Congress and outside critics.</p>
        <p>''The Federal Aviation Administration currently lacks the organizational, management, and financial wherewithal to keep pace with the dynamic aviation community,'' the National Civil Aviation Review Commission, a blue-ribbon panel set up by Congress, concluded in 1996. (The Commission also warned presciently that ''rapidly growing demand combined with a reduction in capacity, as the result of continued reliance on outdated equipment, will bring our nation's aviation system to gridlock soon after the turn of the century.'')</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. has shown some improvement in the last five years. For one thing, Congress mandated a five-year term for the administrator, slowing the turnover at the top.</p>
        <p>After the debacle with the Advanced Automation System, the F.A.A. adopted a much more modest approach to modernizing air traffic control -- a strategy Mrs. Garvey, the administrator since 1997, sums up as ''build a little; test a little; deploy a little.''</p>
        <p>It replaced its old mainframe computers with newer ones and installed color radar display screens. System crashes, which in the 1990's frequently forced controllers to track jets on slips of paper, are now rare.</p>
        <p>But many serious problems remain. The original $12 billion modernization program that was supposed to be completed in 1991 now has a budget of $40 billion through 2004 with no end in sight.</p>
        <p>In addition, what the F.A.A. hails as modernization is the technological equivalent of a new coat of paint. The new mainframe computers that form the heart of the air traffic system are I.B.M. models built in the 1990's that have already gone out of production. The F.A.A. could not buy I.B.M.'s newest machines because they would not run Jovial, the 1960's programming language used in the system's software.</p>
        <p>Jovial, which stands for Jules Own Version of the International Algebraic Language, was created by a programmer, Jules I. Schwartz, 40 years ago as part of a contract for the Strategic Air Command. The F.A.A. plans to switch to a more modern computer language, but the transition ''is very complex and it is going to take literally years,'' said William Shumann, an agency spokesman.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. also had high hopes for a plan called the Wide Area Augmentation System, intended to use the constellation of military satellites that make up the Global Positioning System to enable planes to fly virtually independent of controllers on the ground.</p>
        <p>It was supposed to be operating by 1998, but also proved much more complicated -- and expensive -- than the F.A.A. first thought. The system was made available on a very limited basis last week, but is not scheduled to be completed until 2002. Few believe it will make a significant contribution toward reducing delays.</p>
        <p>''The F.A.A. parades these acquisitions before Congress like they know what they are getting, but they haven't figured out yet what they need,'' said Mr. Mead.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a group of cargo carriers, frustrated by the F.A.A.'s failures, is developing its own air traffic system using satellites. Under this system, each airplane broadcasts its location and identity to all other airplanes. Every cockpit has a display screen, a miniature version of those in air traffic control centers, that tells pilots the flight paths and altitudes of other airplanes in the vicinity.</p>
        <p>Because pilots and controllers have more precise information than is provided by the current radar-based system, airplanes can fly closer together in the sky and land and take off more closely on the ground. Now, for example, pilots must wait for clearance from the tower before they take off. But with the satellite system, if the crew saw that it had the necessary three-mile separation from the previous takeoff, it could decide on its own to depart.</p>
        <p>The new system has been tested in the Midwest. United Parcel Service, which is leading its development, believes it can be useful at its hub in Louisville. But the F.A.A., which has been working with the cargo carriers, has some reservations.</p>
        <p>''What if the second pilot leaves before he has the three miles?'' asked David W. Ford, the F.A.A. official in charge of developing such systems. ''Who gets credited with the operational error?''</p>
        <p>For now, the F.A.A. is working on deploying a series of discrete systems designed to improve the efficiency of takeoffs and landings at busy airports and to allow some airplanes to fly more direct routes. But these improvements will not come close to addressing the long-term growth in air traffic.</p>
        <p>''We know we can make some changes,'' said Steven J. Brown, the F.A.A.'s acting associate administrator for air traffic services. ''Those will be marginal -- not unimportant, but marginal.''</p>
        <p>The Criticism  Should the F.A.A.  Be Scuttled?</p>
        <p>Such talk fuels critics who say that the only way to end the gridlock in the skies is to junk the F.A.A. -- or junk the economics on which its management of the air traffic system is based.</p>
        <p>Under the current arrangement, air traffic control services are paid for by taxes on airline tickets, cargo and fuel. Heavy users like commercial airlines do not pay any more to use the system than private pilots; small planes get the same priority as jumbo jets.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that the resources are not priced properly,'' said Richard Golaszewski, a consultant who has advised the F.A.A. and several European countries. ''In fact, they are not priced at all.'' That means that airlines have no incentive to limit their use of air traffic control services even at the most crowded airports.</p>
        <p>For years, economists have urged the Government to switch to a fee-based system that would force users to pay for the services they use. Raising prices at peak hours would put pressure on airlines to reduce congestion. They might also switch service to underutilized secondary airports, or replace some regional jets with less frequent service on bigger planes.</p>
        <p>''This is the unfinished business of deregulation,'' Mr. Golaszewski said. ''We have taken off all of the controls on what airlines can do, but we haven't done anything to balance demand and capacity.''</p>
        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Newark, LaGuardia and Kennedy airports, and the operators of San Francisco International Airport are considering changes that would discourage small planes, but both airport authorities fear the F.A.A. will block them.</p>
        <p>Many advocates go farther and say that the air traffic control system needs to be separated from the F.A.A. and handed over to a new, independent entity that would operate like a business.</p>
        <p>Various privatization proposals have been floated in Congress over the years, but none have made any progress. A plan that the Clinton administration sent to Capitol Hill in 1994 as part of Vice President Gore's campaign to reinvent government never got out of committee, even though the House was still controlled by Democrats at the time.</p>
        <p>''I told him I'll do all I can to kill this idea,'' Representative James L. Oberstar, a Democrat from Minnesota who was then head of the House Transportation Committee's aviation subcommittee, recalled in a recent interview, referring to Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oberstar, now the ranking minority member on the committee, said that privatizing the F.A.A. would not break the aviation gridlock. ''Who is to say that the private sector is going to do a better job than the public sector?'' he said. ''The same private sector that brings you delays?''</p>
        <p>The F.A.A., he added, is already beginning to act more like a business. Congress passed legislation a few years ago creating a 15-member advisory council to supervise the agency. A bill passed this spring directed the council to hire a chief operating officer to run the air traffic control system.</p>
        <p>Congress also increased the F.A.A.'s budget by $10 billion over the next three years to $40 billion over the next three years. And it required that funds collected from ticket taxes be spent only on  aviation-related projects, such as expanding airports, rather than being used to finance other government programs.</p>
        <p>'' What we want to do is to give these things a chance and see if they won't make a difference,'' said Phil Boyer, president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a longtime oppoinent of privatization whose 360,000 members make up more than half the licensed pilots in the country.</p>
        <p>But critics say that the F.A.A. has been given too many chances already. Mr. Mead, the inspector general, said that Congress has been asking the F.A.A. since 1993 to assign a cost to each of the services its provides, as a prerequisite to charging user fees. Congress finally ordered that study in 1996; the F.A.A. now says it will be completed at the end of 2002.</p>
        <p>Given the recent public outcry about flight delays, interest in privatization is on the rise again. Six years ago, when the Clinton administration floated its proposal, the concept was relatively new. Today, several countries, including Germany, Canada and New Zealand, have successfully contracted out air traffic services.</p>
        <p>Nav Canada, the only private company in the world to run a national air traffic control system, has proven the most intriguing to policy makers in Washington. Before the nonprofit corporation was set up in 1996, the Canadian air traffic control system suffered many of the same problems that plague the F.A.A.: Its equipment was antiquated, and a proposed replacement was behind schedule and far over budget.</p>
        <p>Since then, Nav Canada has managed to reduce air traffic delays, cut costs and revamp its technology. A cost-accounting system enables the company to charge users by the flight. Managers who worked under both systems say the new arrangement has enhanced safety, precisely because regulation and operations have been assigned to two different organizations. Airlines in the United States would like to be able to pay Nav Canada to control some domestic flights, but for now there is no mechanism for Nav Canada to accept such payments.</p>
        <p>Some staff members on Capitol Hill have drafted a privatization proposal modeled on Nav Canada and are looking for a senator to sponsor it. Many analysts say the alternatives -- inching along with current plans or returning to tighter government regulation of air travel -- are unthinkable.</p>
        <p>''My guess is that if we have one more summer as bad as this one, or even one worse than this one, finally it will force the issue,'' said John R. Meyer, a retired economics professor at Harvard who is in favor of introducing user fees. ''That is the silver lining in every cloud.''</p>
