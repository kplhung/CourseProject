        <p>In the 13 years since they were introduced in the United States, the cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins have revolutionized the treatment of heart disease. Study after study has shown these drugs prevent heart attacks and prolong lives, with very few side effects. It is estimated that five million people are taking the drugs, which have rapidly become the best-selling prescriptions in this country.</p>
        <p>Now, the latest research indicates that even more people should be on statins, not only those who already have heart disease -- or a strong propensity for developing it, like diabetics or smokers -- but many who do not, including, perhaps, even young men with high cholesterol levels.</p>
        <p>''Statins have had a greater impact on heart disease than anything that's come out in the past 50 years,'' said Dr. Antonio Gotto, dean of Cornell University Medical College and an educational consultant for several pharmaceutical companies that produce statins. ''They are very safe drugs. I think their downside is very low.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, other experts say the statins are too new and too expensive to start prescribing them to everyone who might benefit. The drugs can cause liver and muscle toxicity in up to 1 percent of patients. Some early studies showed a small increase in violent deaths, including suicides. Though subsequent studies did not confirm this result, the potential exists, as with any drugs, for toxic side effects in the future.</p>
        <p>''We only have 10 years of data on these drugs,'' said Dr. Michael Criqui, professor and chairman of family and preventative medicine at the University of California at San Diego. ''We need 20.''</p>
        <p>The problem doctors now face is deciding when the drugs' benefits outweigh their risks. For some patients, it is easy. ''We're definitely undertreating patients with known cardiovascular disease,'' Dr. Criqui said. These patients alone would swell the ranks of statin takers by 20 million.</p>
        <p>For others, there is more of a debate. ''We don't have sufficient data to recommend statins routinely for young people,'' said Dr. Eric Brass, professor of medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles and chairman of a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee that last month voted not to allow statins to be sold over the counter.  ''There is a potential for unrecognized toxicity.''</p>
        <p>One thing everyone can agree on is that statins are extremely effective at lowering cholesterol. They work by inhibiting an enzyme called HMG CoA reductase that is necessary for cholesterol production, resulting in a cholesterol deficit within liver cells.  Because cholesterol, a fatty substance, is essential for all cellular function, the liver cells start making surface receptors to gobble up the cholesterol floating by in the blood, thereby lowering the level.</p>
        <p>Though cholesterol is essential for life, when its concentration gets too high in the blood, it can be a killer. At high concentrations, cholesterol burrows into blood vessel walls where it attracts immune cells that feed on it. The cells, fattened on the cholesterol, turn into ''foam'' cells, which pad the wall.</p>
        <p>The result is a fatty plaque, which can continue to grow as more cells migrate into it. If the plaque ruptures, by mechanisms that are poorly understood, platelets, the blood cells responsible for clotting, can stick to the wounded plaque, forming a clot that can impede blood flow.  Starved for oxygen, the tissue supplied by the blood vessel dies.</p>
        <p>The first statin was discovered in 1976 by Japanese researchers working on molds. The first statin in the United States, called lovastatin, came out in 1980. Early clinical trials showed it to be more effective, with fewer side effects, than other cholesterol-lowering drugs at the time, like gemfibrozil and niacin. The Food and Drug Administration approved it as a prescription drug in 1987.</p>
        <p>Statins are believed to ameliorate cardiovascular disease in many ways besides simply lowering cholesterol. They appear to stabilize fatty plaques, relax blood vessels and inhibit clotting. They may promote growth of new blood vessels, as reported by Tufts University researchers in the September issue of Nature Medicine. Some experts believe that, like aspirin, they may soon be used to treat heart attacks immediately after they occur.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, their benefits do not  seem to be limited to the heart. A recent study of more than 6,000 patients showed that statin use reduced the risk of hip fracture by 50 percent in elderly patients with osteoporosis.</p>
        <p>The number of people taking statins has grown enormously over the past few years. According to IMS Health, a group that tracks prescription drug sales for the pharmaceutical industry, statins now account for $8.1 billion in drug sales, 6 percent of the total United States prescription drug market and more than any other class of drugs. (Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, like Prozac and Paxil, are second.) Last year, sales of atorvastatin alone, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, grew to $3.56 billion from $2.44 billion, a 46 percent rise. The total number of statin prescriptions grew by 20 percent during that time, three times the average for other drugs.</p>
        <p>Most patients have had very good results. Enid Durant, a 77-year-old Brooklyn woman with diabetes and high blood pressure, recently started taking Lipitor on the advice of her doctor. Within a few months, her total cholesterol level had dropped to 160 from 220 (below 200 is considered normal), and she suffered no side effects. Her doctor was pleased with the results, and so was she.</p>
        <p>But at $3 a pill, the drug has become an almost prohibitive burden on her fixed income. Even with her private insurance, she has to pay $30 a month for the pills, of which she takes one a day. ''Of all the drugs I take, Lipitor is the most expensive,'' she said. ''I know it's helping me, but I don't know if I can keep taking it.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Nanette Wenger, a professor of medicine at Emory University and chief of cardiology at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, argues that the cost of these drugs must enter into the debate over who should take them. ''If these drugs were priced like aspirin, there would be a loud public outcry for them,'' Dr. Wenger said. Though she opposes selling them over the counter, she said she hoped that increasing volume would eventually drive down their costs.</p>
        <p>''We believe we have priced Lipitor competitively and attractively,'' said Andrew McCormick, a spokesman for Pfizer. He added that a portion of the drug's revenues was used to defray the costs of expensive clinical trials.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gotto of Cornell, who was the lead author of a 1998 study showing that statins prevented heart attacks in patients with normal levels of L.D.L. (''bad'' cholesterol) but low levels of H.D.L. (''good'' cholesterol), said he wants to see the drugs sold over the counter soon. But pharmaceutical companies must sharpen their message to get this approved, he said. ''I think the companies need to make a case that this is not for money, but that it's a public health issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For some patients, statins are cramping more than just their wallets. Joyce Litchfield, a 70-year-old woman with heart disease living in Queens, started taking pravastatin, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, two years ago. After a few months, she developed arm pain and went to her doctor. He said it was muscle inflammation caused by the drug. He told her to stop taking it, and her pain went away when she did.</p>
        <p>She recently started taking a low dose of another statin. Though her pain has not returned, her cholesterol level remains high. Her doctor is planning on doubling her dose, she said, but she is worried about the pain coming back.</p>
        <p>Though experts agree that patients who already have heart disease should be on a statin, they do not agree on when statins should be used to prevent heart disease in the first place. For example, a study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association in July found that high cholesterol levels in young men resulted in more cardiovascular disease and death in later years. The research raised the question of whether young men with high cholesterol levels should start taking statins.</p>
        <p>Most experts believe the answer is no.</p>
        <p>A 35-year-old man with high cholesterol but no other risk factors for heart disease, Dr. Brass of U.C.L.A. said, would do well to modify his diet and begin an exercise regimen before starting lifelong drug therapy.</p>
        <p>Dr. Matthew Muldoon, a cholesterol researcher at the University of Pittsburgh, said available data on statins cannot rule out long-term risk. ''We have studies that show statins don't cause cancer within a five-year period,'' he said. ''Of course, neither does smoking.''</p>
        <p>All of which leaves Judith Wyman, a 52-year-old Manhattan aerobics instructor with high cholesterol but no other heart disease risk factors, a bit nervous about the drugs. Last year, her total cholesterol was 245 and her doctor brought up the idea of her starting a statin. She decided to hold off, making some changes in her diet and exercise habits. On a recent checkup her cholesterol level had dropped to 225. She said she preferred lowering her cholesterol the natural way. ''For me it was almost a pride thing,'' she confessed. ''I lead a healthy life. Why should I have to take this pill?''</p>
