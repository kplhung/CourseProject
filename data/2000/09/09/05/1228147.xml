        <p>Editorial in series, Campaign 2000, examines approaches to gun control espoused in presidential campaign by Republican Gov George W Bush and Democrat Vice Pres Al Gore; notes despite horrible crime statistics resulting from easy access to guns, Americans are still allowed to buy and keep unlimited arsenal of firearms with few restrictions and little governmental regulation; says Bush's reliance on Congress to take lead on issue suggests nothing will be done if he becomes president; says presidential leadership and passion will be crucial if there is any hope of enacting new forms of gun control (M)</p>

        <p>We live in a nation awash in guns where more than 30,000 Americans die annually by gunfire, a toll that includes about 4,000 children and teenagers. Yet despite these horrible statistics, Americans are allowed, as in few other industrialized countries, to buy and keep an unlimited arsenal of firearms with very few restrictions and little government regulation.</p>
        <p>The massacre at Columbine High School and multiple killings in schools, workplaces, restaurants and other public places have brought home to voters the need for stricter, more consistent gun control laws. Yet Congress has been shamelessly servile to the demands of the National Rifle Association, refusing to approve even the most modest measures that might help curb gun violence. On this central public safety issue the two presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, have very different records and agendas that will determine whether meaningful controls are achieved in the next administration.</p>

        <p>We live in a nation awash in guns where more than 30,000 Americans die annually by gunfire, a toll that includes about 4,000 children and teenagers. Yet despite these horrible statistics, Americans are allowed, as in few other industrialized countries, to buy and keep an unlimited arsenal of firearms with very few restrictions and little government regulation.</p>
        <p>The massacre at Columbine High School and multiple killings in schools, workplaces, restaurants and other public places have brought home to voters the need for stricter, more consistent gun control laws. Yet Congress has been shamelessly servile to the demands of the National Rifle Association, refusing to approve even the most modest measures that might help curb gun violence. On this central public safety issue the two presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, have very different records and agendas that will determine whether meaningful controls are achieved in the next administration.</p>
        <p>There are now some 190 million firearms in civilian hands, about three-quarters of which are  owned by only 10 percent of the adult population. About 65 million of those firearms are handguns, which are responsible for most gun-related deaths and injuries.</p>
        <p>In an ideal world, a central agency would oversee the manufacture and distribution of guns in the way that government regulates other potentially hazardous products, like drugs and pesticides. But in the absence of a truly comprehensive regulatory regime, there are several important steps that can be taken to prevent the death toll from rising.</p>
        <p>One key improvement would be a law establishing nationwide licensing of gun owners and registration for the tens of millions of firearms now in circulation. Such a system would ensure that gun owners pass safety training tests and enable law enforcement agencies to track weapons to their owners. The Brady law requiring background checks of gun purchasers has stopped tens of thousands of felons from buying handguns from licensed dealers. But in 1998, the five-day waiting period for handgun purchasers under that law expired and was replaced by a national instant check system. Congress should approve at least a mandatory three-day waiting period to allow for more thorough background checks of non-felony records on mental health and domestic violence charges.</p>
        <p>Congress also needs to close the loophole in the law that allows criminals and other unqualified individuals to buy guns at gun shows without having to undergo a background check. This is a huge problem. There are more than 4,000 gun shows held annually around the country, and these events have become a major source of guns that are illegally trafficked and end up in criminal hands. Congress's refusal to close this deadly loophole is an unconscionable concession to the pro-gun lobby.</p>
        <p>A nationwide one-gun-a-month purchase limit for individuals would help reduce the number of guns on the street. Raising the minimum age for possession of handguns and assault weapons from 18 to 21 and requiring mandatory child safety locks on handguns could help prevent some gun deaths and injuries to children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has embraced many of these proposals -- pushing strongly for licensing for gun owners, closing the gun show loophole, banning the sale of cheap ''junk guns'' that are so often used in crimes, enacting a three-day waiting period, a one-gun-a-month rule and various child safety provisions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seems to be softening his pro-gun stance, but his record in Texas has been one to gladden Charlton Heston's heart. In 1995 he signed a law that made it legal for Texas residents to carry concealed weapons, and in 1997 he expanded that law to allow concealed weapons in churches and hospitals unless those institutions expressly prohibit weapons on their premises. Last year Governor Bush signed a law making it extremely difficult for cities in Texas to bring lawsuits against gun manufacturers. Such suits by many cities around the country have been instrumental in putting pressure on Smith &amp; Wesson, the nation's largest gun manufacturer, to agree to alter the way it makes and markets guns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush opposes licensing and registration, a three-day waiting period on purchases, and limiting purchases to one gun a month. On the campaign trail and in his literature, he emphasizes tougher enforcement of existing laws, although he does say he will not push for a nationwide version of Texas's concealed weapons law. He says he would accept some type of background check at gun shows, and that he would sign a mandatory trigger lock requirement if Congress put such a measure on his desk.</p>
        <p>But relying on Congress to take the lead means nothing will be done. Presidential leadership and passion will be crucial if there is any hope of enacting new forms of gun control.</p>
