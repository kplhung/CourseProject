        <p>One evening last summer, Dennis M. Lynch, a young entrepreneur, was waiting to meet two potential investors at his company headquarters in Edgewood, N.Y., where he sells used computer and office equipment over the Internet.</p>
        <p>''I think they're small-time investors,'' he remembers telling his associate, Michael J. Browne. ''John and David Sculley.''</p>
        <p>''John Sculley?'' Mr. Browne replied. ''He's the former C.E.O. of Apple.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch, who is 30, might be excused for not recognizing John Sculley's name. The last time Mr. Sculley was in the news was in 1994 -- when, just four months after resigning as chief executive of Apple Computer, he then quit as chief executive of Spectrum Information Technologies, a wireless-technology company where accounting irregularities had occurred before Mr. Sculley arrived.</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Sculley, now 61, has maintained uncharacteristically low visibility. A Wharton-trained executive, who at 38 was running PepsiCo's domestic soft-drinks unit and in 1983 jumped to Apple, he has for the last five years run a small venture capital firm with his two brothers, Arthur and David. It is his way of fulfilling a desire to work with his family -- and to help proselytize people about the virtues of the Internet without suffering the corporate intrigue that overwhelmed him at both Apple and Spectrum.</p>
        <p>Now he focuses on start-ups like TechSmart, the company founded by Mr. Lynch, and serves as mentor and friend as well as investor. Minutes after starting their meeting, Mr. Sculley and his younger brother were drinking beer with the Generation X entrepreneurs and trading tales about growing up on Long Island. By the end of the evening, the Sculleys had tentatively committed themselves to invest $1 million and promised to offer guidance on how to build a small company into a much bigger one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sculley may still be licking his wounds, but he is far happier in his new career. And so are his brothers, who are also veterans of corporate America. Arthur Sculley, 55, ran J. P. Morgan &amp; Company's $80 billion private bank until 1995, and David Sculley, 54, was president of the H. J. Heinz Company's domestic operations until 1989. ''This is the absolute most wonderful time of our lives,'' said John Sculley, sitting in his Park Avenue office with a view of the Empire State Building. ''We're in total control of our ground rules.''</p>
        <p>Having fun while teaching young entrepreneurs, he said, now takes priority over earning maximum returns. By using their own assets, they do not subject themselves to the pressure of performing for investors. Nonetheless, he said, they expect high returns over the long run.</p>
        <p>So far, Sculley Brothers has invested in 26 start-ups. Four are either profitable or breaking even, John said. But the brothers' track record so far, at least as it can be judged from the outside, leaves something to be desired. Three of the five companies they backed that have gone public -- like many other Web-based businesses since the Nasdaq shakeout in April -- now trade at rock-bottom prices.</p>
        <p>One of them, Buy.com, an Internet retailer, closed on Friday at $2.81, down more than 90 percent from last February's initial public offering at $30. Another, Talk City, a builder of online communities, has also plunged, closing on Friday at $1.56 compared with $12 when shares were first sold to the public in July 1999. John Sculley said both are doing well but suffering in the market along with other Internet companies.</p>
        <p>Another is NetObjects, which helps businesses build Web sites and, like other software companies, has been shifting from selling products to providing online services. Its shares, offered at $12 in April 1999, closed on Friday at $3.75, down nearly 70 percent.</p>
        <p>Not to worry, John Sculley said. Before the share prices of NetObjects and Talk City plunged, Sculley Brothers sold some holdings at good gains. And since they invested early, they acquired equity in all three companies well below the price set at the initial public offering. So the brothers said they remain in the black.</p>
        <p>Besides the collegiality, one reason John Sculley said he enjoys working with his brothers is that they protect him from a tendency to take people at their word, which he said had hurt him in the corporate boardrooms. They also keep him, colleagues say, from being so dazzled by technology that he does not watch the bottom line.</p>
        <p>At Apple, for example, his record of memorable marketing and increased sales was partly undone by his focus on Newton, a hand-held computer that was a forerunner of the Palm Pilot but never sold well because its technology was flawed. Critics said that by spending so much time on Newton -- and on trying to become an industry luminary -- Mr. Sculley did not prepare for a price war that cut revenue of Apple's core product, the Macintosh computer. The board fired him in 1993. ''I was ambushed at Apple and pushed out,'' Mr. Sculley said.</p>
        <p>David Hancock, Apple's former marketing chief, remarked: ''He can be distracted by neat new stuff and can jump at it. He can get fooled by people. He needs people who can refocus him.''</p>
        <p>Those people are his brothers, Mr. Sculley said. ''I have been too trusting in the past, so it's great to have my brothers there to help me on this.'' Where John and David, the enthusiastic marketing guys, can be swept away by an idea, for example, Arthur, the no-nonsense banker, often plays devil's advocate.</p>
        <p>They first fantasized about working together in the late 1980's while walking on a beach in Bermuda, where they were attending the annual meeting of a perfume factory founded by a grandfather. The idea of banding together in venture capital took shape after John Sculley left Spectrum and began searching for a new career. While visiting companies and attending technology conferences, he decided that the Internet was creating a revolution and that he wanted to be part of it.</p>
        <p>''Because of John's marketing experience, he understood the power of the Internet as a business tool and a marketing tool,'' said Joshua Ruch, managing partner of Rho Ventures, a New York venture capital firm that has invested in some of the same companies as the Sculleys.</p>
        <p>John Sculley also appreciated that this revolution, in its early days, involved small, private companies out of the public eye. ''We really aren't looking for any publicity,'' he said, after having first declined to be interviewed. ''We aren't trying to prove anything to anyone.''</p>
        <p>He began investing in start-ups and in 1995 became nonexecutive chairman of LivePictures, an Internet imaging company. Several months after he gave up the chairmanship in 1998, the company went bankrupt, though it was then sold to the Toronto-based MGI Software, allowing investors to break even. (He attributes the company's failure to ''weak management'' too distant for him to watch closely.)</p>
        <p>But other projects were thriving, including Cambridge Display Technology, a developer of flat-screen video displays; Veon, which provides interactive video services; and Sirius Thinking, creator of the PBS children's program ''Between the Lions.'' Cambridge Display was sold last year to two private venture capital firms, delivering a ''very high return'' to the Sculleys and other early investors, John Sculley said.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Arthur joined John to form Sculley Brothers. Arthur, also a Wharton graduate, had spent 25 years at J. P. Morgan, where he said he contracted ''the entrepreneur's bug'' while setting up offices in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
        <p>John and Arthur pursued projects based on their individual interests. Arthur co-founded IntraLinks, which distributes prospectuses for syndicated loans over the Web, and served as chairman of the Bermuda Stock Exchange as it adopted electronic trading. That led him to specialize in business-to-business exchanges, and Sculley Brothers has invested in four -- including Catex, which trades catastrophe reinsurance contracts and BigMachines.com, where companies can buy and sell industrial equipment. CreditTrade, which serves as an exchange for credit derivatives, just turned profitable, John said.</p>
        <p>David Sculley, 54, joined the family firm in 1996. After 22 years at Heinz in Pittsburgh, four as head of Heinz USA, he said he became drawn to ''building companies rather than managing companies.''</p>
        <p>Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, the Heinz chairman, was sorry to see him go. ''He's a great motivator of people,'' Mr. O'Reilly said. ''There's a pulse about him, whether he's talking about ketchup or the Internet.'' And David Sculley, he added, is attentive to profitability.</p>
        <p>In creating their business, the Sculley brothers made it a priority to keep things simple. They dress casually and have no other partners, working with a few assistants in a spacious office.</p>
        <p>Their approach to selecting investments is also straightforward: They meet only with people they know well or have been referred to by someone they trust. ''We don't solicit,'' Arthur Sculley said. ''We don't want any business plans.''</p>
        <p>Several investments have resulted from John Sculley's Apple connections. One is Presenter.com, an online conference center founded in 1998 by Eric Chen, a former Apple engineer. Mr. Chen, in turn, referred the Sculleys to the man who founded Gizmoz, a company that builds Internet broadcast networks. Sculley Brothers invested in Cambridge Display Technology on the advice of Herman Hauser, an engineer who worked on the Newton.</p>
        <p>The Sculleys declined to say how much money they have to invest, only that they put an average of $1 million into each venture. But they offer services beyond that -- serving as mentors for some entrepreneurs, attracting new investment for others, and often ending up on the boards of the companies in which they have invested.</p>
        <p>''We look for board members with thoughtful ideas and connections, and they have both,'' said Tom P. Hirschfeld, a general partner at Patricoff &amp; Company Ventures of New York, who is a director of IntraLinks and Talk City.</p>
        <p>''We've all run big divisions,'' Arthur Sculley said. ''Now we're hands-on.'' John elaborated, ''We've learned lessons from both our successes and our mistakes that any C.E.O. would have to deal with.''</p>
        <p>Take Gizmoz. Captivated by the potential of the technology, John Sculley became nonexecutive chairman and persuaded the founder, Eyal Gever, 30, to move to New York from Israel. Today, John speaks with Mr. Gever nearly every day.</p>
        <p>''I bring John with me to open doors, but mostly to negotiate,'' Mr. Gever said. ''He's guided me on multiple levels.'' John's pitch helped to persuade America Online to invest in Gizmoz earlier this year. Mr. Sculley also accompanies Mr. Gever on television programs, as he does with other entrepreneurs, using his own celebrity to draw media attention.</p>
        <p>All three brothers have become involved in BigMachines.com, an industrial-equipment exchange based in Foster City, Calif. David Sculley helped the founders -- Goerdt Abel, a neighbor of his in Pittsburgh, and his son, Godard -- develop a business plan. Arthur guided them on how the exchange would work. John establishes connections with potential partners and investors.</p>
        <p>The three have also contributed to PeoplePC, an Internet membership buyers' club that went public on Aug. 15 at $10 a share. Even though it has since fallen to $8.44, the Sculleys' 4 percent stake, which they acquired for $2.1 million, is now worth about $36 million.</p>
        <p>Arthur Sculley has made introductions that led to group memberships. David brought in consultants.</p>
        <p>And John advised on marketing and operations. ''There were a lot of complex operational issues that he just nailed Day 1,'' said Michael J. Price, a former investment banker at Lazard Freres, who serves on the PeoplePC board. ''He's got some of the soundest operating judgment I've ever seen.''</p>
