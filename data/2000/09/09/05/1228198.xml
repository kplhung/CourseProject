        <p>She is a tall Russian teenager with long blond hair who crushes her forehands into the corners and now finds herself in the quarterfinals of the United States Open.</p>
        <p>But Yelena Dementieva has no commercials, no calendars, no Web sites, no boyfriends and no sponsorships. She is 18 and, for the moment, buys her own shirts and skirts to wear on the court.</p>
        <p>Dementieva is 5 feet 11 inches, does not want attention and could care less about comparisons to her compatriot Anna Kournikova. ''I don't think about Kournikova,'' she said, her bright blue eyes both innocent and intense.</p>
        <p>She has plenty else to think about, especially because Dementieva is the one advancing in this Open, in only her second year playing Grand Slam events.</p>
        <p>In the blistering heat right before the burst of another rainstorm yesterday, a crosscourt backhand from the 22-year-old American Lilia Osterloh sailed wide, giving Dementieva the third-set tie breaker and a 6-3, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (5) victory.</p>
        <p>The match was an ugly test of wills as the two combined for 99 unforced errors, 44 of them by Dementieva.</p>
        <p>''I didn't play my game, I was not being very aggressive,'' she said. ''It was very hot today. But it was very important to win when I was not playing well.''</p>
        <p>In the final set, Dementieva got an early service break and raced to a 5-2 lead. But Osterloh battled back to tie the set and lifted her arms in a ''raise the roof'' gesture to get the crowd behind her. Then the roof fell in. Osterloh lost two straight points and Dementieva gained a 6-5 lead.</p>
        <p>Even after Osterloh forced the final-set tie breaker, Dementieva gained the early advantage, forcing Osterloh into errors. The nerves got to Osterloh, a Columbus, Ohio, native ranked No. 57. For the second straight Grand Slam event, she had the chance to get to the quarterfinals, but failed once again. ''I'm happy with this tournament; it's very encouraging for me,'' she said. ''Wait till next year.''</p>
        <p>Dementieva, ranked No. 25, looked ahead to her next match, in which she will meet 10th-seeded Anke Huber, whom she beat in three sets in Indian Wells, Calif., in March. ''It will be much easier because she is the favorite,'' Dementieva said.</p>
        <p>Dementieva began playing tennis when she was 7 in Moscow, coached by Marat Safin's mother. After graduating from a French-language high school last year, Dementieva has steadily improved her English and her game. At the 1999 Fed Cup final against the United States, she came back from a 1-4 third-set deficit to defeat Venus Williams.</p>
        <p>Before her upset victory over No. 7-ranked Conchita Martinez on Saturday, her grandfather asked her to win for him. It was his 80th birthday. Before her victory over Osterloh, Dementieva called her father in Moscow. It was his 54th birthday yesterday. ''He asked me to win for him,'' she said. ''Now I'm looking for someone else who has a birthday.''</p>
