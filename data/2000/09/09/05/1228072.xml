        <p>People who want to start exercise programs but feel they don't have enough time or energy to begin should think again.</p>
        <p>A new study suggests that physical activity that lasts just 15 minutes, if done often enough, may be as beneficial as longer workouts. The report appeared last week in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association.</p>
        <p>The total amount of time spent exercising, not the length of each session, appears to be most important, the researchers said.</p>
        <p>They said they hoped their findings would encourage out-of-shape people daunted at the prospect of one-hour or even half-hour workouts.</p>
        <p>The findings were based on surveys taken in 1988 and 1993 of more than 7,000 men with an average age of 66. The men were asked to give their medical histories and to describe their exercise routines.</p>
        <p>The surveys suggested that those who worked out in short sessions had the same heart-disease risk as those who worked out longer, as long as the same amount of energy was expended in the short sessions.</p>
        <p>In a second study published in Circulation, researchers found that people who reported engaging in more intense forms of physical activity had a lower risk of heart disease.</p>
        <p>People who reported walking three or more miles per week, considered moderate, had a 10 percent reduction in risk, the study said.</p>
        <p>But those who engaged in activities like jogging, tennis, swimming or aerobics showed decreases in risk of as much as 20 percent.</p>
        <p>The studies involved participants in the Harvard Alumni Study.</p>
