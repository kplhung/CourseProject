        <p>Back in Utah, they are inmates at Bluffdale State Prison. But out here in the fire zone, they strut proudly in black T-shirts proclaiming themselves members of the Flame 'N' Go Hotshots.</p>
        <p>''Being in this program makes all the difference,'' Bart Clark, 33, a six-time felon who has spent 11 of the last 15 years in prison, said this morning before shouldering his backpack on a hill acrid with smoke.</p>
        <p>''Now I can tell my 4-year-old son that his dad isn't in prison, he's out fighting fires.''</p>
        <p>Almost every day since mid-May, Mr. Clark -- convicted most recently of kidnapping -- and the rest of his 20-man crew have been outside the wire, battling blazes across the West. The Utah program began in 1985, and as inmate-firefighters this year, the crew is far from alone.</p>
        <p>In this devastating fire season, one in six of the crew members fighting fires by hand is a convict, drawn from state prisons in an enterprise that most everyone involved seems to see as benefiting all concerned.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes there are special considerations, on account of their being inmates,'' said Mike Melton, a Forest Service official in command of the  firefighting effort about 20 miles from this tiny town, deep in the mountains of central Idaho. ''But frankly, we're glad to have any help we can get.''</p>
        <p>Other federal officials say the inmates have been invaluable, providing a much needed, well-trained and well-supervised reinforcement to resources that have worn thin.</p>
        <p>At wages that average $1 an hour, the use of inmates is a bargain, one that might ease the taxpayers' burden in a year in which federal firefighting costs will exceed $1 billion.</p>
        <p>And in conversations here in Idaho and in their Utah prison home, these inmates also described themselves as blessed, seeing fire as a vehicle that has brought not only a taste of freedom but an opportunity to redress old wrongs.</p>
        <p>''Most of my life, I took things from other people, and now it's time to give something back,'' Tommy Phong, 33, said, puffing a cigarette in the early morning chill as he and the crew prepared to head out. After more than 13 years in prison, Mr. Phong, who was convicted of armed robbery, is scheduled to be paroled early next year, and he said he hoped his three summers fighting fires would prepare him for life outside of prison.</p>
        <p>''All that time you're in prison, what's on your mind is to get out on the street,'' Mr. Phong said. ''And from my first years as a firefighter, I've seen what it is like.''</p>
        <p>As the inmates loaded their gear, they were only one hub in a swirl of activity at the fire camp, home to forest rangers, college students, paramedics and skiers apparently unfazed by having prisoners in their midst.</p>
        <p>''With some of the inmate crews, we get an extra security briefing, and the women are supposed to walk around in pairs,'' said John Cataldo, 28, a ranger in Alaska's Denali National Park who is on temporary fire duty in Idaho. ''But everyone treats the Flame 'N' Goes like a regular hotshot crew.''</p>
        <p>The Utah team is the only crew of inmates to hold a federal designation as ''hotshots,'' slang for top-ranking Type I status. They wear the T-shirts, not the orange prison jumpsuits assigned to inmates from California and some other states and --  under state policy -- are accompanied by unarmed escorts from Utah's Department of Corrections, not the gun-carrying guards common to some other inmate camps.</p>
        <p>With wages that can reach $5.55 an hour, the Utah crew is better paid than other inmate teams, though the rate is just a fraction of civilian wages. A civilian firefighter with the same elite status would make about $15 an hour plus overtime.</p>
        <p>But in all the heady rush, the prisoners have also been given a sobering reminder that firefighting is not without risk. Two fellow inmate-firefighters were killed last week in Utah in a lightning strike, raising questions about just how much value might be attached to an inmate's life.</p>
        <p>The State of Utah has paid only for the inmates' funerals, and state officials say they cannot be confident that the two prisoners will become eligible for federal death benefits of nearly $150,000 that is routinely paid to firefighters slain in action.</p>
        <p>''When we signed up, we had to sign a waiver that released the state from any liability,'' Michael Kinikini, 33, a member of that team and a convicted robber, said at the Utah prison this week. ''But the bottom line is that we're out there protecting public land, and if we die, the compensation should be the same as for everyone else.''</p>
        <p>Of the two men killed, Michael Bishop, 27, had spent seven years in prison for attempted murder, while Roger Braithwaite, 26, had spent three years behind bars after a conviction for vehicular homicide. Both were within 36 months of their scheduled parole dates, a prerequisite for consideration in the Utah crew, and both had been moved to minimum-security quarters, another requirement.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't too proud of him when he first went in to prison,'' Dan Bishop of Riverton, Utah, said of his late son. ''But I became very, very proud.''</p>
        <p>By official count, some 25,000 firefighters are now involved in battling dozens of blazes across the West.</p>
        <p>That count includes ground crews, air squads, fire engine personnel, and an army of supervisors and support personnel, said Neil Hitchcock, a federal fire manager who coordinates the use of firefighting resources.</p>
        <p>About 13,000 people belong to crews assigned to the fire lines, Mr. Hitchcock said. Of these, more than 2,000 are inmates, according to estimates provided by regional fire centers, with most operating in California, home to the nation's largest inmate-firefighter program.</p>
        <p>With an overall force of 60, divided among three 20-person crews, the Utah prison-firefighting program is one of the smallest in the West.</p>
        <p>In addition to California's, which is spread across 38 conservation camps, another large program exists in Nevada and numbers about 900 inmates. Wyoming, Idaho, and, most recently, Texas are among the states that have established smaller operations.</p>
        <p>In no state are the inmates compelled to serve as firefighters, state officials said.</p>
        <p>The Utah program stands out in part because its inmate-firefighters are routinely permitted to travel outside the state, so that its teams have been in the lead this summer in battling some of the nation's largest fires.</p>
        <p>But still, federal officials say that the contributions by other programs have also been felt widely, because the widespread use of inmates on fires in California, for example, has freed civilian crews to focus on blazes in Idaho and Montana, the states that have been hardest hit this summer.</p>
        <p>In every state, the inmates are led by state forestry officials who guide them in firefighting techniques and relay directions from fire commanders. And though the rules imposed on inmates vary from state to state, a common denominator is a ban on participation by sex offenders or suspected escape risks. There have been no reported escape attempts or other incidents of misconduct involving inmates in the firefighting this year.</p>
        <p>''They don't want anybody with any rabbit in them,'' said another inmate, Bryan Kawa, 32, of South Ogden, Utah, who was convicted on a weapons charge. Mr. Kawa, like other prisoners, is housed in a minimum-security dormitory, 30 men to a room, when he is not on the fire lines.</p>
        <p>Among the advocates of prison-firefighting programs are those who argue that they make good economic sense.</p>
        <p>In California, where the state prison population now stands at 162,000, it costs $21,000 a year to house a prisoner behind walls but just $13,000 a year at one of the conservation camps, said Mack Reynolds, a corrections official who supervises that state's program.</p>
        <p>In California and some other states, the incentives offered for prisoner participation include early release, with a one-day credit in time served typically offered for every day that an inmate works on the fire line. In Utah, however, sentences are fixed, which state officials say is a reason that they provide more pay.</p>
        <p>Some prisoner-rights advocates, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, have campaigned for broad changes in the law that would require that inmates be paid at least minimum wage and be made subject to other labor-protection laws.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Carol Gnade, the group's executive director in Utah, said she had mixed feelings about the  program.</p>
        <p>''On the one hand, we encourage prisons to get more involved in giving opportunity to prisoners,'' Ms. Gnade said. ''But at the same time, they should extend that to the same kinds of protections that other people receive.''</p>
        <p>The Utah inmates and their escorts described compensation as just one reward. ''We get up on top of mountains where no one else has ever been,'' said Mr. Kawa, who is scheduled to be released in January after 11 years in prison.</p>
        <p>''It's a zoo in there, and it's ugly,'' Ben Van Zandt, 35, a corrections officer, said of Bluffdale prison, home to 5,000 inmates. ''A lot of these guys have spent many years in that zoo. And what this program does is to help them move from the zoo to the outside world.''</p>
