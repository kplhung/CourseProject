        <p>For those of us steeled against an Olympic onslaught of kangaroos, koalas and Crocodile Dundee kitsch, ''Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore'' offers a protective coating for the brain. Robert Hughes's six-part series is not the only program to ride the coattails of the Sydney games, but it is the only one to explode the myths and cliches that others mindlessly indulge. ''Croc Hunter Holiday,'' the title of a Travel Channel documentary, says it all about the standard glimpse at Australia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes's work is of a different order, sharp cultural criticism that is also entertaining. It is driven by a distinctive blend of qualities. Because Mr. Hughes grew up in Australia but has lived abroad for 35 years, he has a lovingly intimate yet detached perspective. His ideas are enhanced by inspired visual imagery and crisp cinematography; you might expect that, knowing that Mr. Hughes built his reputation as an art critic.</p>

        <p>For those of us steeled against an Olympic onslaught of kangaroos, koalas and Crocodile Dundee kitsch, ''Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore'' offers a protective coating for the brain. Robert Hughes's six-part series is not the only program to ride the coattails of the Sydney games, but it is the only one to explode the myths and cliches that others mindlessly indulge. ''Croc Hunter Holiday,'' the title of a Travel Channel documentary, says it all about the standard glimpse at Australia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes's work is of a different order, sharp cultural criticism that is also entertaining. It is driven by a distinctive blend of qualities. Because Mr. Hughes grew up in Australia but has lived abroad for 35 years, he has a lovingly intimate yet detached perspective. His ideas are enhanced by inspired visual imagery and crisp cinematography; you might expect that, knowing that Mr. Hughes built his reputation as an art critic.</p>
        <p>A bigger surprise is how well his on-screen presence holds the series together, with an amused, probing, literate commentary that makes him the most engaging of guides. He may be the only person ever to emerge from a near-death experience wryer than ever, his already acute sensibility sharpened, and not a smidgen of sentimentality added. (The six-hour series will be shown tonight through Thursday from 9 to 11 on PBS.)</p>
        <p>As Mr. Hughes says at the start, he was filming this series when he was nearly killed in a car crash. On camera here, he walks with a cane to observe the mangled car for the first time and seems shaken all over again, rightly pointing out that no one should have escaped from such a mess. His bones were shattered, but as he wrote in a Time magazine essay last year, when he saw death there was no ''tunnel of white light with Jesus beckoning at the end, as featured in the memoirs of a score of American Kmart mystics.'' He emerged as skeptical as ever about an afterlife but ''crazily happy'' to be alive in this one, determined to embrace every minute.</p>
        <p>That tone pervades the series, as he flees from emotional indulgence and quickly moves on to examine how much truth might be behind the stereotypes of his home country, like the fun-loving Aussie and the romanticized outback. The answers are never simple, and the complexity is often captured by resonant images.</p>
        <p>Fruit bats swarm into a beautiful midnight-blue sky that turns out to be dotted with Sydney skyscrapers. The bats are invading the city at nightfall, ''reminding us the bush is never far away,'' Mr. Hughes says at the end of Episode 2, ''The Dead Heart.'' That episode suggests that while the mythic Australia is about the outback, true Australians dream of a home in the suburbs. When he visits the remote city of Perth in Episode 3, ''Money, Class and Power,'' he discovers that the nouveau riche mansions built during the 1980's boom look like suburban houses ''inflated with a bicycle pump.''</p>
        <p>A jumbo jet decorated with an almost psychedelic swirl of Aboriginal art becomes the perfect metaphor for the clash of culture and race examined in Episode 4, ''Before Trousers,'' whose title refers to the Aborigines' term for the years before white settlers arrived.</p>
        <p>Everywhere Mr. Hughes finds the push and pull of cultural forces that goes back to Australia's days as an English penal colony (chronicled in his absorbing 1987 book, ''The Fatal Shore''). In tonight's opening episode, ''Body and Soul,'' he goes to Sydney's colorful gay and lesbian Mardi Gras, a parade that recently drew more people than the pope's visit there. But for every ''larrikin,'' the caricatured boozy hedonist, Australian history has offered a countervailing ''wowser,'' a bluenose.</p>
        <p>Conflicts between the descendants of the prisoners shipped to Australia in the 18th century and the descendants of free settlers still echo. Mr. Hughes visits his childhood home, a large upper-middle-class house whose new owners have maintained its refined Georgian style. The camera approaches it from a child's angle, so the house looks as palatial as it did to him as a boy. Now it prods him to notice that the idea of a nearly classless society ''is one of the great illusions Australians like to spin for themselves.'' A nation with more than its share of gamblers, Australians choose to believe that luck rather than heredity or skill is the basis for success. Theirs is ''the meritocracy that dare not speak its name,'' he says in one of the witty phrases that glide through his narration.</p>
        <p>The delusion that we have no rigid class hierarchy applies to Americans just as easily as Australians, though Mr. Hughes doesn't need to say so. There are so many similarities, and equally revealing differences, between the United States and Australia that at times he allows them to speak for themselves, and sometimes makes his point explicitly. '' 'Reconciliation' is the new buzzword of Australian politics,'' he says in his episode on Aboriginal culture, without mentioning how the issue reverberates in the United States, both in black-white racial tensions and the history of American Indians.</p>
        <p>Today Aborigines want white Australians to apologize for having taken their land. Mr. Hughes visits Ayers Rock, the monolith in the desert, which in 1986 was returned to the Aborigines yet remains a tourist trap. Simply mentioning the rock is a political statement, depending on whether it is called Ayers Rock or Uluru, the Aboriginal name that has been restored. The natural wonder has been ''reduced to a totem by political and social wrangling,'' Mr. Hughes says. ''Before Trousers,'' one of the richest episodes, includes an interview with a middle-aged woman from the so-called ''stolen generation,'' Aboriginal children taken from their parents in the first half of this century to be raised by whites.</p>
        <p>Whatever similarities the series implies, Mr. Hughes is most emphatic about the great defining differences between America and Australia. In frontier America space meant freedom; in Australia the vast space was literally one big prison. And because America was founded as a religious utopia and utopias do not exist, we were ''doomed to disappointment.'' With its roots as a penal colony, Australia ''had nowhere to go but up.''</p>
        <p>It's too bad there is no companion book to Mr. Hughes's series, but there is a charming alternative in Bill Bryson's current best seller, ''In a Sunburned Country'' (Broadway Books), which approaches Australia from the opposite perspective. Where Mr. Hughes is an insider come home, Mr. Bryson is the outsider enthusing about his discovery of Australian culture. Though his book is not nearly as substantial or thoughtful as the Hughes documentary, it is an intelligent, breezy tour in which the witty author is delighted by Australia without being blinded by its stereotypes. He especially likes the prime minister who disappeared by walking into the sea and was memorialized with a swimming pool. Even that much thoughtfulness is rare, as a glance at next week's television programs about Australia suggest.</p>
        <p>The Discovery Channel's ''Extreme Australia'' (Monday at 9) is a snoozy documentary largely about geology, snakes and platypuses. It is useful if you want to be reminded of why you dozed through natural history class. The program does not actually play the song ''Kookaburra'' (''Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree''), but the high school aura was so severe I heard it anyway.</p>
        <p>The Travel Channel begins ''Australia Week'' on Monday with ''Croc Hunter Holiday'' (not available for review), a new special in which Steve Irwin, the host of the Animal Planet show ''Crocodile Hunter,'' tours the country with his family. Then from Tuesday through Friday (each night at 8), the Travel Channel will repeat an Australia-themed special. Most have that deadened travelogue tone and one (''Freshwater Crocs'' on Thursday) has Mr. Irwin cooing at the sweet behind of a kindly freshwater crocodile. Evidently it's the saltwater crocs that'll kill you.</p>
        <p>However banal their narratives, even these lesser programs suggest that it is nearly impossible to take a bad photograph of Australia. Whatever the Olympics bring, there is this consolation: At least everything will look pretty. And if the ''Kookaburra'' song gets stuck in your head, here's a hint: it can easily be displaced by ''Waltzing Matilda.''</p>
