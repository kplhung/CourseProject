        <p>''A little bit of eye candy'' is how the singer Kevin Aviance modestly characterized himself as he paraded around the pool of the Hard Rock Hotel on a sultry desert night wearing patent leather thigh-highs, a buttocks-baring leopard-print jump suit and a glittery fedora rakishly cocked on his shaved skull.</p>

        <p>''A little bit of eye candy'' is how the singer Kevin Aviance modestly characterized himself as he paraded around the pool of the Hard Rock Hotel on a sultry desert night wearing patent leather thigh-highs, a buttocks-baring leopard-print jump suit and a glittery fedora rakishly cocked on his shaved skull.</p>
        <p>''I'm all about sparkle,'' he added. ''Out of the box and over the top. That's why I love D&amp;G.''</p>
        <p>D&amp;G, of course, is the Italian label run by Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana, whose idea of making their debut at the colossal apparel convention known as Magic was to bypass so prosaic a sales tool as a booth. Instead, they gambled on making their presence felt with a poolside fashion show and a live performance by the singer Mary J. Blige before an invited crowd of 3,500. Although short on the Hollywood celebrities who attend their Milan runway shows, the evening did feature an imported posse of drag queens to lend an aura of old-style Las Vegas glitter and oomph.</p>
        <p>It was needed. Las Vegas has been cleaned up, as everyone knows, the raw frontier town of neon and naked ladies, of mobsters in sharkskin suits and saurian pensioners yanking the slots rendered family-friendly. But a certain conviction is missing from the city's latest incarnation, with its fake Paris, its fake Monte Carlo and its crudely rendered miniature fake New York. The root of the problem also afflicts the twice-a-year Magic trade show and, for that matter, American fashion itself. Someone mislaid the franchise on Americanness.</p>
        <p>With 3,200 companies, 5,500 brands, 21,000 product lines and 96,000 attendees from 110 countries at the latest show, from Aug. 28 to 31, a visitor might have expected an energetic surge, or, at the very least, the appearance of a direction. But Magic -- ground zero for mass market apparel, especially men's wear -- felt aimless and mired.</p>
        <p>There were entire aisles of Hawaiian shirts. There was a section given over to board sports, with skateboarders flying about ''catching air.'' There were the industrial majors -- Ralph Lauren, Levi's, Tommy Hilfiger -- showing clothes guaranteed not to surprise. There were thousands of variants on the T-shirt, still the essential American contribution to world fashion. And there was a larger-than-ever representation of hip-hop-inspired urban wear, the clothes that have driven a revitalized apparel industry in recent years, with brands like Fubu, Phat Farm and Sean John, and that now look as renegade as a button-down shirt.</p>
        <p>In a twist, one of the few manufacturers supplying some certifiable cool at the latest Magic was Ben Sherman, a 37-year-old British firm that introduced American-style poplin button-downs to England in the 60's and was, for a while, shirt maker to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. ''Kids are into these shirts their fathers wore,'' said Steve Collins, a sales representative for Acupuncture, a trendy British shoemaker whose current ad campaign features a man masturbating with a shoe. ''Ben Sherman is burning up.''</p>
        <p>Very little else here is, unless you factor in the halfhearted effort some manufacturers are making to revive the 80's, an era you'd have to develop amnesia to lament. In fashion terms, the 80's are a John Hughes film, a Cyndi Lauper video. Think of shiny fabrics, moussed hair and skinny ties hanging loose from a shirt with an oversize pointed collar.</p>
        <p>As stylistic detours go, this revival is a singularly perverse one -- although possibly on the money. Vegas, too, is in the grip of an unfathomable 80's revival, with casino headline acts like Sheena Easton, Eddie Money and Andrew Dice Clay. Even Mr. T was spotted, on opening night of Magic, strutting through the Mandalay Bay hotel lobby and boasting, ''I kicked Rocky Balboa's behind!''</p>
        <p>''It's all coming back, all together,'' said Bruno Derval, president of California Sunshine Activewear, a licensee of Playboy Enterprises. At Mr. Derval's booth in the immense Las Vegas Convention Center, the main exhibition hall, buyers lined up to see denim wear sporting Playboy bunny logos as centerfold models served Krispy Kreme doughnuts and flashed cosmetically perfected smiles.</p>
        <p>The tone associated with the nattier days of Sinatra and the Rat Pack, or even Playboy, reflected a town where high rollers were expected to dress for play. Las Vegas is not that place anymore. Maybe nowhere is, in the aftermath of casual Fridays. Heavy hitters in Vegas are now mostly segregated in private betting suites, while the lobbies of most casinos are given over almost entirely to the slots that generate over 50 percent of gambling revenues.</p>
        <p>The dress code there is set by the ''worms,'' as the slots players used to be known. Any visitor who arrives expecting glamorously bejeweled women worn as armpieces by guys in Brioni is in for a letdown. Even in V.I.P. lines at casino restaurants and lounge shows, customers turn up in tube socks and short shorts. ''Never in 100 years would you guess that these people have money,'' said a sales representative at the Bellagio hotel's luxury mall, Via Bellagio (Chanel, Gucci, Vuitton, Prada). Looking as if you've hit the jackpot now seems somehow beside the point.</p>
        <p>It isn't for Dolce &amp; Gabbana, which is not only attuned to the mythical cheesiness of this most American city, but enthusiastic about American archetypes. In the D&amp;G scheme of things, consumption is axiomatically conspicuous, flash is good and the borders between retail categories -- urban wear, sports, formal -- are permeable, to say the least. The United States market currently accounts for just 16 percent of Dolce &amp; Gabbana's overall business, but the company's showing at Magic bids to change that by exposing D&amp;G to a wide range of retailers. The beneficiary of the coolly democratic vision put forth by this Milanese and Neapolitan couple might be American men's wear over all.</p>
        <p>Why, D&amp;G seemed to suggest, segregate style into hip-hop or preppy ghettos? As demonstrated at the runway show, staged on a catwalk cantilevered over the Hard Rock pool, Perry Como cardigans can look great with graffitied denim. Glitter isn't dead. Even a mullet can be cool if you bleach it and add some post-Twisted Sister attitude. And there's life beyond a Tommy Hilfiger logo in Old Glory, now reworked as hip-huggers and worn with a denim work shirt with artificial ''dirt'' stitched into the elbows, the whole thing topped by a plaid fedora for some Vegas-y pizazz.</p>
