        <p>Naoya Tsukahara bounced up and down on the trampoline that had been lowered into the floor. Up and down and up and down again, then suddenly, in a split second, he lofted himself high into the air and did two graceful, twisting, vertical somersaults before landing, like a butterfly, on his tiny feet.</p>
        <p>In that momentary performance, at the end of a recent, sweaty three-hour practice session with the Japanese men's gymnastic team, was a flash of deja vu. For that peculiar pretzeled somersault, a hallmark of Naoya's performance, is a derivation of Japan's most famous gymnastic stunt, the ''moon'' somersault. It was concocted by his father, Mitsuo Tsukahara, who used it 28 years ago in Munich to win his first individual Olympic gold medal, on the horizontal bar, scoring a 9.9 out of 10 in the process.</p>
        <p>''I would fold my body and somersault in the air while twisting,'' the elder Tsukahara said. ''What Naoya does is twist his body while keeping it straight. The style is different, but the basic skills are those of the moon somersault.''</p>
        <p>Now there is a chance that Naoya will use that somersault to do something that his father never did -- win an individual gold medal in the all-around men's gymnastic competition. He won the silver in the all-around at last year's world championships, and the gymnast who beat him there, Nikolai Krukov, damaged his Achilles' tendon this past spring and is not expected to be in peak condition in time for the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, which begin on Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>''Well, that's a possibility,'' Naoya's father said of his son's odds for a gold medal. ''He has a chance.''</p>
        <p>The younger Tsukahara's performance in Sydney may also help restore some of Japan's glory, when the country seemed to be a breeding ground for top male gymnastic talent. In the 1960's and 1970's, when Mitsuo Tsukahara was flying around the gym, the Japanese men's team was the only real challenger to the powerful, state-supported gymnasts from the Eastern bloc. The Japanese team won five straight gold medals from 1960 to 1976, edging out the Soviet Union each time. Tsukahara was on the last three of those teams, and he also won six individual Olympic medals -- two gold, one silver and three bronze.</p>
        <p>A vault that still bears the father's name, the Tsukahara, was first performed about 30 years ago by Mitsuo Tsukahara. It consists of a cartwheel with a quarter-turn followed by a backward somersault. The maneuver marked the first time a gymnast had performed a 360-degree somersault while vaulting, and the acrobatics revolutionized the event.</p>
        <p>''It was really unique and very original and it just changed all of vaulting completely,'' said Peter Kormann, the United States men's Olympic coach.</p>
        <p>Japan has not won a gold medal for gymnastics since the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, when Koji Gushiken struck gold in the all-around competition and on the still rings, and Shinji Morisue won a gold medal on the horizontal bar. ''It will be extremely significant if Naoya wins a gold medal,'' said Kenji Takamiya, a reporter at the sports newspaper Nikkan Sports who covers gymnastics here.</p>
        <p>Gymnasts here are almost entirely dependent on corporate sponsorship. But a decade of economic decline, coupled with the dwindling fortunes of Japan's gymnasts, has resulted in diminished financial support for the sport. Takamiya said that even Daiwa Bank, long known as a backer of gymnastics here, has cut back its support.</p>
        <p>A victory by Naoya Tsukahara or any other member of the Japanese team in Sydney could change that. ''The Japanese gymnastics world is in critical condition,'' Takamiya said. ''My guess is that the only way to save it is for Naoya to win a gold medal.''</p>
        <p>The lack of air-conditioning at the Asahi Gymnastics Club, where Naoya works out, is a telling sign of the times. The two small, portable air-conditioning units are pushed around the gym to cool the areas where Naoya and his team members are working out. The chalk that the gymnasts use to coat their hands hangs heavy in the air, irritating eyes and lungs.</p>
        <p>Asahi Mutual Life Company supports the gym, which has long been home to many of Japan's best gymnasts. It is a family affair for the Tsukaharas, with Mitsuo serving as the director and men's head coach and his wife, Chieko, also a former Olympic gymnast, serving as the women's head coach.</p>
        <p>When Naoya travels to Sydney, he will carry along an ivory seal bearing his name that his mother gave him, repeating one of his father's traditions. ''I think Naoya will end up in the top 10, but whether he wins a gold, silver or bronze medal, I can't say,'' Chieko Tsukahara said. ''The abilities of the top 10 male gymnasts in the world are so close that a lot of it will have to do with luck.''</p>
        <p>She believes the family is blessed with good luck. Her husband, for example, won one of his gold medals for the horizontal bar on a day when a knee injury he had suddenly subsided during the competition.</p>
        <p>''I believe in working hard on training so that you can capitalize on luck,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Naoya follows a rigorous workout schedule, practicing for two or three hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon. Asked what the family talks about over meals, he paused for a moment and smiled before saying, ''Gymnastics, of course.''</p>
        <p>He is studying business administration at Meiji University, but spends much of his spare time in the gym, a habit that gives his father pause. Mitsuo Tsukahara recalls spending more time training -- and regretting it.</p>
        <p>''I practiced more, but I think you can practice too much,'' he said. ''The thinking about this has changed since my time.''</p>
        <p>Naoya's coaching has also differed from his father's and it has become something of a curiosity here. One might have expected his father to serve as his coach, but instead, when Naoya was starting junior high school, his father retained a Chinese coach, Wu Jie, to train him. Wu, a top Chinese gymnast, was in Japan studying Japanese and looking for a part-time job when Mitsuo Tsukahara hired him.</p>
        <p>Foreign coaches are still an oddity in Japan, so tongues really wagged in 1994 when Tsukahara brought in his old friend and rival Nikolai Andrianov, a chain-smoking former top gymnast from Russia, to coach his son. Andrianov won seven medals at the Montreal Olympics in 1976, including a gold in the all-around, leaving Tsukahara to pick up a bronze medal in the same event. Both Naoya and his father credit Andrianov with raising Naoya's skills to international standards and with giving him the confidence he would need to compete in world championships.</p>
        <p>''Look, I am in charge of this place and was the head coach of the Japanese women's team at the time, so I was busy,'' Tsukahara said. ''I wanted Naoya to have a proper coach, and at the time, Chinese and Russian gymnasts were on top of the world.''</p>
        <p>Now his son is a contender for similar distinction, but the Tsukaharas deliberately play down his talents and prospects by severely limiting his exposure to the news media. A recent interview with Naoya after a two-hour training session with the Japanese team was limited to precisely 15 minutes, although his parents were far more generous with their time.</p>
        <p>''When I won my medals I was happy, of course,'' the elder Tsukahara said. ''But before I won them, I always felt like I was under a lot of pressure to win, like people were pushing too hard.''</p>
        <p>The moon somersault that contributed to the elder Tsukahara's lore in Japan got its name from the day he first attempted the maneuver in competition: July 20, 1969, the day that Neil A. Armstrong walked on the moon.</p>
        <p>The father's experiences convinced him that the biggest contribution he now could make to Naoya is to keep reporters at a safe distance. He is particularly wary of the idiosyncratic Japanese television scene, with its emphasis on slapstick humor and embarrassment. ''They often ask things like what's your favorite food, what hobby do you have, who's your favorite star and would you like to teach her how to do a somersault on TV,'' Mitsuo Tsukahara snorted. ''TV can come after the games, I hope.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the strategy has worked, because Naoya seems preternaturally calm and self-possessed for one with so many hopes resting on his exaggeratedly broad shoulders. He is famous for telling his father he did not need his company in the waiting room during the Olympics in Atlanta, Naoya's first Olympic competition. ''He sent his father back out to watch the action, telling him, 'You don't have to come with me, Papa,' '' Takamiya said.</p>
        <p>Naoya said he could sense that there were great expectations for him at the Olympics. ''But my state of mind really hasn't changed,'' he said during the brief interview, ''although having said that, I would add that I do have higher spirits these days.''</p>
        <p>His biggest concern is injuries, a fear his mother shares. He has a keen sense of his boundaries and accepts them. ''From now until the Olympics, I will not try to stretch too much, reach too far,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He has been practicing since first grade, deciding then to give up a passion for soccer for his parents' sport. His father said Naoya lost some enthusiasm for gymnastics in his adolescence, but Naoya himself has a different recollection.</p>
        <p>''Since I was little, I have been in this environment,'' he said. ''I've played in this gym since I was young. So it feels natural that this is what I'm doing.''</p>
