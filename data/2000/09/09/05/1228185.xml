        <p>Three years after the state established an ambitious prekindergarten program, New York City has more money than ever to carry it out, but virtually no space in school buildings for the classes.</p>
        <p>Prekindergarten programs in the city's 32 community school districts are already held in a variety of settings, including day care centers, religious schools and community centers. Usually, they are conducted without an educational leader, like a principal, on the premises, and without the company of older students.</p>
        <p>''The ideal situation would be if we could house our prekindergarten programs in our own school buildings and in our own classrooms,'' said Terri Thomson, the Queens representative on the New York City Board of Education. ''The cold reality is that we do not have enough classrooms.''</p>
        <p>Universal prekindergarten is the educational issue du jour. Vice President Al Gore made it part of his presidential platform, and the Republican presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has a program for poor children in his state.</p>
        <p>Preschool is regarded as a way to close the achievement gap between rich and poor students. Studies show that poor black children who receive high-quality day care from infancy to age 5 outperform their peers through adulthood. Forty-two states have adopted preschool programs geared toward poor children.</p>
        <p>In preschool, children who have previously stayed at home with their parents learn to socialize with others their own age. They learn to take turns, and to take care of themselves as well as their building blocks, markers and paints. They even begin to recognize letters and numbers.</p>
        <p>''By midyear, you are able to walk into any universal prekindergarten class and any 4-year-old will tell you, 'We are going to go paint,' or 'We are going to build blocks now,' '' said Eleanor Greig Ukoli, director of early childhood education for the Board of Education. She has worked closely with Augusta S. Kappner, the president of the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan, to set up the city's program.</p>
        <p>But in New York City's overcrowded schools, it has been hard to turn this program into reality.</p>
        <p>When the State Legislature established the $500 million program in 1997, it set aside money for teachers and aides, but none for construction. The law was amended to require local school districts to devote at least 10 percent of money they received for prekindergarten programs to contracts with private agencies.</p>
        <p>The space shortage is so severe that Irma Zardoya, superintendent of Community School District 10 in the Bronx, one of New York's most crowded districts, returned authorization for 140 seats, or the equivalent of eight classrooms, to the city because there were not enough qualified community organizations to provide space and run such programs.</p>
        <p>''That's frustrating because it's a resource to us,'' Ms. Zardoya said. ''You never want to turn down a resource, especially when you know that prekindergarten is such a great program.''</p>
        <p>Jason Henry, senior adviser to the board's chief financial officer, said many districts give up preschool seats because they lack school space and community organizations in their areas.</p>
        <p>Last year, 65 percent of the preschool programs were housed in buildings other than public schools. The Board of Education had to contract with 315 agencies to accommodate the children. The board expects that figure to rise to 500 agencies this year, meaning more classes will be held outside of schools.</p>
        <p>This year, the city must accommodate 43,976 students, or just under 40 percent of the 113,000 eligible 4-year-olds. The prekindergarten program gives priority to poor children, drawing from the 74 percent of students in the city's public schools who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.</p>
        <p>The program is financed with $146.5 million in state dollars, matched by $16.1 million from the Board of Education. This financing pays for half days in New York City.</p>
        <p>Some parents have complained to school board officials about being unable to find the prekindergarten programs because they are scattered across school districts, away from school buildings. More often than not, there are no notices telling parents where to find the programs.</p>
        <p>In some cases, half-day sessions are inconvenient for working parents who cannot leave their jobs in the middle of the day to pick up their children. As a result, thousands of parents are unable to take advantage of the program.</p>
        <p>Still, some districts have been able to find ways to offer some full-day programs, working with community organizations that can help get the money to pay for the remainder of each school day.</p>
        <p>School Board President William C. Thompson Jr. said that the program was expanding, and that it was available to any parent who wanted it, despite the issue of space. He said that school districts were scrambling to sign contracts for their opening days. Most of the preschool programs have staggered start dates.</p>
        <p>In the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx, the Susan Wagner Day Care and Day School is ready for public-school children for the second consecutive year after passing fire, health and safety inspections, said the executive director, Joyce L. James.</p>
        <p>''We've been meeting with parents for orientation,'' she said last week. ''We see them as their children's first teacher.''</p>
