        <p>Woke up yesterday and decided to go to a baseball game. It was a holiday, didn't have to work, and what a better way to spend the day than watching a game? Went around the house looking for a schedule but couldn't find one. Desk was so overrun with newspapers and magazines and piles of papers it could be the 2002 season before schedule surfaces.</p>
        <p>Oh well, might as well just get in the car and drive to Yankee Stadium. Must be a game there, right? Yankees played there yesterday, and they're not going to leave on a holiday, are they? Who are they be playing? No idea, but a game's a game.</p>

        <p>Woke up yesterday and decided to go to a baseball game. It was a holiday, didn't have to work, and what a better way to spend the day than watching a game? Went around the house looking for a schedule but couldn't find one. Desk was so overrun with newspapers and magazines and piles of papers it could be the 2002 season before schedule surfaces.</p>
        <p>Oh well, might as well just get in the car and drive to Yankee Stadium. Must be a game there, right? Yankees played there yesterday, and they're not going to leave on a holiday, are they? Who are they be playing? No idea, but a game's a game.</p>
        <p>This is the time to see the Yankees. Except for a misstep now and then they seem to be headed in the direction that says World Series this way. Even when they were stumbling around earlier in the season, it was obvious they were going to get to the playoffs because they know how to win and they know what they have to do to win.</p>
        <p>The Chicago White Sox looked for a while as if they were going to be the cream of the American League crop, but look at them lately. They had a 10-0 lead against Anaheim the other day, and their pitcher walked the first three batters in the sixth inning. He'll go far in the postseason. The next day they scored nine runs in the first inning, then had to scratch for two runs in the eighth to win the game.</p>
        <p>Then there were the Seattle Mariners. They put together their best pitching staff ever and they were playing as if Ken Griffey Jr. never existed. They began running away from the rest of the American League West and had a seven-game lead toward the middle of last month. But then in the space of nine days, they lost five games from that lead.</p>
        <p>Good pitching is supposed to keep teams from spiraling into long losing streaks, right? Well, the Mariners lost 15 of 18 games before they beat up on Boston during the weekend.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox. Now there's a team for you. Some guys who are supposed to know what they're talking about picked Boston to win the pennant; some went even further and said they'd win the World Series. Can you imagine that? These guys actually thought the Red Sox were going to beat the Yankees. In what millennium?</p>
        <p>No, the Yankees won't have the Red Sox to kick around next month. Their pitchers did them in. Jeff Fassero hasn't made the comeback some expected, Ramon Martinez hasn't returned to dominance in his younger brother's draft and Bret Saberhagen never made it back from his latest injury. He gets more space in medical journals than in media guides these days.</p>
        <p>All right already, enough talk. Let's get to the game. There's Yankee Stadium in all of its majesty. Why would the Yankees ever want to abandon it?</p>
        <p>But it must be early; there's no traffic around the Stadium. There are virtually no people either, just two kids riding those snazzy new scooters in the rain. The Stadium gates and the ticket booths are closed, and the parking lots are empty.</p>
        <p>Oh, oh. The sign at the top of the Stadium says the next game is Sept. 11 against Boston. That's next Monday. That means the Yankees must be out of town. That means it must be the Mets who are in town. So onto Shea Stadium; it's not far, only 10 miles across the Triborough.</p>
        <p>This is the time to see the Mets. Sure, the Cardinals swept them in St. Louis, but the Mets had won the first six games between the teams so this was just the Cardinals getting a little even, getting the psychology straight in case the teams play next month.</p>
        <p>The Mets are in great position to win the National League East because the Braves have been struggling. They've lost 17 of their last 31 games. Five weeks ago they led the Mets by five and one-half games; now their lead is one game even with the Mets' lost weekend in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>The only thing the Mets have to watch is how they play the rest of the month. Last season, they were only a game behind the Braves with 12 games left. The problem was half of the games were with the Braves, and the Braves won five of them. The Mets had to win the last three games against Pittsburgh to force a playoff for the playoffs.</p>
        <p>They play the Braves six times again this month, this time in the last 13 games. Maybe this time the outcome will be different. Maybe this time the Mets will win five of the games and the division and then the League Championship Series.</p>
        <p>But they won't win anything if they don't score more runs than they have scored in recent games. This is no time for the hitters to stop hitting. It's time for Robin Ventura, Todd Zeile and Derek Bell to start hitting.</p>
        <p>Hey, maybe they'll start hitting in their Labor Day game at Shea. Must be close to game time; lot of cars in the parking lot. What's that? The Mets aren't playing at Shea. The cars are for the tennis across the street? That's what two policemen said. The Yankees are playing at home, they said.</p>
        <p>So it's back to Yankee Stadium in search of a game. But there's no game there. There's no game anywhere. Labor Day and no game in New York.</p>
        <p>Only tennis, but no one who's looking for a baseball game is going to settle for a tennis match. Better to just go home and go back to sleep and rest up for the Subway Series.</p>
