        <p>The sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk was a tragic but incredibly illuminating example of the transition the world, and Russia, are now going through from the cold-war system to the globalization system. Unfortunately, there's always some guy down the line who hasn't gotten the word yet. In this case it was Russia's president, Vladimir Putin.</p>
        <p>Yo, Putin, this ain't your father's Soviet Union anymore.</p>
        <p>In an interview on Russian TV following the Kursk tragedy, Mr. Putin defended his government and laid out his priorities: ''I will be with the army. I will be with the fleet. I will be with the people.'' As Time magazine's Paul Quinn-Judge noted in a commentary from Moscow, Mr. Putin still believes that ''the needs of the state always come first; individual concerns come a distant second.''</p>
        <p>Not in this era. What happens when a country like Russia plugs into globalization -- into global free markets, telecommunications, media and the Internet -- is that individuals become empowered, even super-empowered. That is, their ability to gather information themselves, earn a living and assert their will directly -- as individuals -- greatly increases thanks to globalization and the falling of walls everywhere. Moreover, when everyone starts to know how everyone else in the world is living, which also happens in globalization, individuals start to demand the same things. And they get angry when their leaders don't deliver.</p>
        <p>The Kursk incident showed just how much the Russian people are starting to get this, and how little Mr. Putin does. Why did Mr. Putin and his generals resist asking for foreign help until it was too late? Because they feared it would sully the honor of Mother Russia's army and puncture Russia's pretense to still being a superpower. But the families of the Russian sailors, who knew foreign help was available, told them: ''I don't want to hear about Mother Russia, or Father Russia. I want Yuri, Boris and Oleg off the ocean floor.''</p>
        <p>The message those parents sent to Russia's leaders was that ''until further notice, you better have a good reason to risk a Russian soldier's life,'' remarked the Israeli political theorist Yaron Ezrahi, whose book, ''Rubber Bullets,'' documents how Israel went through a similar transformation. ''They sent a message that while national honor still matters, individual life and individual aspirations now matter too. They are now viable competitors with national honor -- and may matter even more. So it's not only Americans who don't want to die for abstractions anymore. It's also Russians.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Russian newspaper Izvestia ran a front-page picture of the crew of the Kursk, under a remarkable headline: ''The Price of National Pride -- Human Lives.'' Such a headline, with such an equation, would have been unthinkable in the cold war, but it is utterly normal in globalization.</p>
        <p>Sure, Mr. Putin can still send Russian soldiers to die in Chechnya, because many Russians still perceive that as a war of no choice against a real internal threat. But with the collapse of the cold-war system, they do not perceive an external threat. Indeed, most Russians would like to emulate America today, not bury it. And vice versa. Americans also prayed for the Kursk to be saved. Because without the cold-war psychological framework, the Kursk disaster was not seen as an enemy loss. It was seen as a human loss.</p>
        <p>Does this mean that Russia will now have to fold its army and navy? Of course not. Russian nationalism and national security interests haven't gone away. But they now have a viable competitor in shaping Russian decision-making: the aspiration of individual Russians for personal security and personal fulfillment -- which today's globalization system encourages, by giving more Russians the information, connections, power and incentives to act on their own for their own betterment.</p>
        <p>So everything is still possible with Russia. It's still possible that an autocratic Russian leader will try to restore Russian military power and provoke a war with the U.S. Yes, that is still possible. But in today's era of globalization it is much less sustainable. Because Russians will not automatically put up with pain and sacrifice anymore just to preserve some national symbols. Not in this world. That was the Kursk's crew's last message -- a message Russian leaders ignore at their peril.</p>
