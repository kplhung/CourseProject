        <p>Keith Hamilton is a realist who does not mind jolting his teammates.</p>
        <p>Hamilton, the Giants' defensive tackle, looked back at Sunday's season-opening victory over the Arizona Cardinals and saw a performance littered with mistakes. He also saw what the Giants' next opponent, the Philadelphia Eagles, did to the Dallas Cowboys and shuddered.</p>
        <p>''Anybody who thinks we played great yesterday is crazy,'' Hamilton said today. ''We won, but I didn't have a really good feeling that we just went out there and dominated that team like we could have. It was good to get a win, and you have to be happy to get a win, but there was enough things we did wrong that concern me.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''If anybody thinks we were just great yesterday, they weren't looking at the same game I was looking at. I've been around long enough to know you make those kind of mistakes against another team, there'd be a lot of unhappy faces in here. I'm not too overly thrilled about the way we played yesterday.''</p>
        <p>The Giants' defense spent most of the preseason defending itself against skeptics, so hearing Hamilton's critique after a 21-16 victory was eye opening. Few Giants were giddy after Sunday's victory, except perhaps for the ones responsible for the dazzling running attack.</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel could not help but watch the Eagles destroy the Cowboys on television in the postgame interview room. Philadelphia's 41-14 victory may have quickly washed away Fassel's euphoria over his fourth opening-day victory in four seasons, but he could not have asked for a better way to catch his players' attention.</p>
        <p>''It should have,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hamilton did not want to slight the Cardinals, but his message was clear. Arizona was ravaged by injuries, its running game was nonexistent and quarterback Jake Plummer was shaky. Still, the Cardinals scored twice in the final two minutes to pull within 5 points at 21-16. Against a better team, Hamilton said, the Giants would have lost. Consider what the Eagles did in Dallas: their top running back, Duce Staley, rushed for 201 yards, and they sacked Troy Aikman four times and knocked him out of the game in the second quarter with the ninth concussion of his career.</p>
        <p>The Giants' revamped offensive line allowed Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne to rush for a combined 222 yards Sunday and did not allow a sack of Kerry Collins. But it will face a very active Eagles defense that loves to blitz. ''I'm sure they're going to get their licks,'' Collins said.</p>
        <p>The Giants held Arizona to 43 yards rushing, but Hamilton was disappointed that the defensive line produced no sacks -- middle linebacker Mike Barrow had the Giants' only sack -- and continued having problems pressuring the quarterback. It is unlikely that the Giants will have the same dominance over Staley, which would put more pressure on the secondary. And they will have another mobile quarterback to chase in Donovan McNabb. The Giants also have history to overcome; they have lost their second and third games in each of the last three seasons after winning the openers.</p>
        <p>Adding to Hamilton's apocalyptic outlook is the uncertain status of strong safety Sam Garnes, who left Sunday's game with a concussion after being hit on the side of his helmet by his teammate Jessie Armstead. Garnes felt better after leaving the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan this morning. He stayed overnight for observation.</p>
        <p>Garnes is scheduled to undergo more tests Tuesday, and Fassel left his availability in question. Garnes said that seeing the Eagles' result Sunday made him more eager to play, but even he was unsure if he would be allowed to.</p>
        <p>''Right now, they think I probably won't,'' Garnes said.</p>
        <p>Garnes's absence would expose an already thin secondary. Lyle West, who played for the injured free safety Shaun Williams in the preseason, would be the likely substitute.</p>
        <p>After the hit, Garnes said, he could not recall gaining consciousness and walking to a cart that drove him off the field. He was in a playful mood today, at one point saying: ''I'm just a little upset that we got blown out by Arizona. Just kidding.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach JIM FASSEL said that IKE HILLIARD and RON DIXON would pay more than just a fine for missing Saturday's practice, but he declined to reveal the additional penalty. Dixon and Hilliard each said they overslept because they did not set an alarm clock. Hilliard, a veteran who is letting the rookie Dixon stay at his home, said he took full responsibility. Practice began at 10:30 a.m., and Hilliard said he did not wake up until well after 11. Fassel said Sunday that the Giants finally woke up the players when they called, but Hilliard said Monday that the team was unable to reach them. ''I have to be a man about the situation,'' Hilliard said. ''I let the team down. I let this organization down. I let my teammates down.''</p>
