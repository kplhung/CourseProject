        <p>At 88, Nathan, a New York businessman with a sharp, clear mind, was still going to work every day. Then an episode that resembled a ministroke landed him in the hospital, where numerous medications were administered.</p>
        <p>Within days, Nathan's mind and memory had turned to mush. The family was ready to put him in a nursing home when, at a knowledgeable relative's request, the drug regimen was reviewed and several drugs of questionable necessity were discontinued. Nathan soon returned to his previous mental state and was able to continue working for several more years.</p>
        <p>Ninety-five-year-old Anne of Boca Raton, Fla., also had a sharp mind and good memory until two potent drugs she was given for rheumatoid arthritis, along with six or seven others for related health problems, led to such severe mental deterioration that she became unable to communicate with her favorite brother. Within weeks of being taken off the two arthritis drugs and Valium, she began to come back to herself.</p>
        <p>Both Nathan and Anne were the victims of polypharmacy, a ''poisonous cocktail'' -- as some doctors put it -- of three, four or more drugs that may have side effects that render the treatment worse than the disease.</p>
        <p>Although there are no precise statistics on the incidence and consequences of polypharmacy, experts report that it is an increasingly common problem now that so many people live into their 70's and beyond, when nagging physical discomforts and chronic health problems often arise. In various studies, 10 percent to 20 percent of hospital admissions for older people were found to result directly from adverse reactions to prescribed medications.</p>
        <p>Causes and Consequences</p>
        <p>In a report several years ago in The Journal of General Internal Medicine, Colleen A. Colley, a pharmacist, and Dr. Linda M. Lucas, then both at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Portland, Ore., described the problem in detail and offered numerous suggestions to remedy it. Though polypharmacy is by no means limited to the elderly, they noted that twice as many medications were prescribed for patients 65 and older than for younger ones, and that older people used seven times as many over-the-counter drugs as the general adult population.</p>
        <p>Three-fourths of visits to doctors in the United States end with a written prescription, partly the result of patients' expectations that ''modern medicine should provide an antidote for every symptom'' and partly to save the doctor's time, the authors wrote.</p>
        <p>The problem of polypharmacy is now being aided and abetted by direct marketing of prescription drugs to the general public and by the increasing availability of and publicity for herbal and other nonprescription remedies with drug effects and side effects.</p>
        <p>Many patients have two or more physicians and use multiple pharmacies, so no one person knows every drug they are taking. Given the high cost of many drugs and the lack of Medicare coverage for prescriptions, many patients hoard leftover drugs and take them on their own when symptoms return. Finally, changes in drug regimens, and sometimes in the physical appearance of drugs, can confuse patients who may end up taking the wrong drug, too much of the right one or two or more similar medications for the same condition.</p>
        <p>Polypharmacy can become a vicious cycle in which side effects caused by one or more medications are ''treated'' with yet another drug that has side effects of its own. And, two or more different drugs taken together can sometimes interact to cause serious complications. The problem is worse in older people in part because they metabolize drugs more slowly, resulting in a buildup of toxic doses.</p>
        <p>Then, too, a complicated medication regimen or the occurrence of side effects may result in noncompliance: the patients simply stop taking the drug or take it less often than prescribed, reducing its therapeutic benefit. This may prompt the doctor to increase the dose or prescribe yet another drug to control the problem.</p>
        <p>In one study of patients discharged from a hospital, the more medications that were prescribed, the greater was the number of errors the patients made in taking them. Those discharged with six or more medications had an error rate of 70 percent.</p>
        <p>Reducing the Risk</p>
        <p>There are many ways patients and their doctors can avoid the hazards of polypharmacy. They start with the patient -- or patient's advocate -- acting as a responsible partner in his or her health care. First and foremost, don't expect a drug to be the solution for every symptom.</p>
        <p>Many health problems are best treated with adjustments in diet and exercise habits, stress management or simple behavioral changes. For example, rather than a sleeping pill to treat insomnia, changes in habits like caffeine use, naps or bedtime routines may solve the problem without a drug.</p>
        <p>When any drug is prescribed, patients should insist that the name, purpose, dosage instructions and possible side effects, especially those warranting a call to the doctor, be provided both orally and in writing. Patients should also be told when to expect an improvement and, for drugs that treat hidden symptoms like elevated blood pressure or cholesterol, they should be kept informed of progress, or lack of it, being made toward the desired therapeutic goal.</p>
        <p>At each visit to a doctor, especially one new to the patient, it is crucial to provide a complete list of the kinds and amounts of every drug being taken, including over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies, which may have the same drug effects or side effects as a prescribed medication or may interfere with the effectiveness of a prescribed drug.</p>
        <p>For example, the herb St. John's wort can impair the effectiveness of several important drugs, including the heart drug digoxin (Lanoxin) and the antidepressant imipramine (Tofranil). Some experts suggest a ''brown bag'' approach, in which patients  put all their pills, including vitamins, in a bag and bring them to the doctor for review. Even if you always see the same doctor, a periodic review of what you take can help prevent polypharmacy problems.</p>
        <p>When you are given a prescription and are told why, be sure to fill it and take it as prescribed. Noncompliance with doctor's orders -- taking too little or too much of a prescribed drug -- is a major cause of polypharmacy. Complicated dosing schedules can also interfere with compliance.</p>
        <p>If, say, you are taking one drug four times a day, another three times a day and a third twice a day, ask the doctor if an adjustment can be made to reduce the chances that you might forget or get confused. Many drugs used for chronic health problems are available in several dosage forms, including time-released, which may permit a reduction to only one or two doses a day.</p>
        <p>Unpleasant side effects also lead to noncompliance with a prescribed regimen. Rather than discontinuing a drug or reducing the dosage on your own, tell the doctor about side effects you cannot tolerate; often another medication can be substituted or a change can be made to solve the problem.</p>
        <p>Finally, try to fill all your prescriptions at the same pharmacy, where a record is kept of what you are taking.</p>
        <p>And before buying over-the-counter or herbal remedies, check with your pharmacist to see if any will interact badly with drugs you are taking.</p>
