        <p>Before metropolitan Atlanta began its relentless march north, bulldozing forests of loblolly pine and soybean fields, the Etowah Indian Mounds here was a remote state historic site where children visited the ancient burial grounds, and astronomers viewed the stars.</p>
        <p>But now the site, about an hour northwest of Atlanta, borders a subdivision of 500 houses, whose roofs are visible from the ceremonial mound and whose lights obscure the constellations. Two other subdivisions are on the drawing board, off Old Alabama Road, which is soon to become a four-lane highway.</p>
        <p>''It's closing in on us,'' said Libby Bell, the site's manager, who frets that a sod farm and a pasture flanking the mounds could give way to urban sprawl, despite promises from the owners that they will not sell. But Ms. Bell worries that when land is money, promises can be broken.</p>
        <p>''What happens next?'' she asked. ''We could have subdivisions right up to the fence line.''</p>
        <p>The development at the perimeter of the Indian mounds, and at an additional 24 of Georgia's 63 state parks, earned the state the designation as most threatened in a recent survey by the National Park Trust, a Washington-based private land conservancy. According to the report, 8,212 of 74,542 acres of state parkland here is endangered by sprawl, commercial and residential development, traffic and rising land values, which all make it difficult for governments to buy open land.</p>
        <p>The parks said to be in jeopardy, in states including Nevada, Florida and Ohio, are not themselves at risk of disappearing. Rather, they are ringed, or soon will be, by buildings, rushing traffic and neighbors who may consider fragile areas extensions of their backyards.</p>
        <p>''The solitude you expect in a park is now being lost to high-rises, second homes and lawn mower noise,'' said Paul C. Pritchard, president of the National Park Trust. Urban encroachment, Mr. Pritchard said, turns ''conservation areas into city parks, and historical sites into playgrounds.''</p>
        <p>That Georgia was at the top of the list came as no surprise to conservationists, urban planners, political leaders and residents here, who have watched their state -- and especially the 16-county greater Atlanta area -- explode in the last decade, unfettered by geographic barriers like mountains or oceans, and encouraged by the region's laissez-faire attitude toward regulating land use.</p>
        <p>The threat to the parks, said Lawrence Frank, a professor of city planning at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is ''one of the unthought-out, less measured impacts of rapid, unplanned growth,'' more often discussed in terms of choking traffic, unsightly strip malls, cookie-cutter subdivisions and air like ozone soup.</p>
        <p>''We used to laugh at Los Angeles,'' said Vince Taylor, manager of the Sweetwater Creek state park in Lithia Springs, the closest to downtown Atlanta and destined to be ringed by office parks and condominiums. ''Now we are Los Angeles.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor, whose park is a 2,050-acre oasis just 15 miles from city skyscrapers, is more resigned to development than Ms. Bell, who grew up in Lilly, Ga., (population 50) and assumed when she came here 21 years ago that the Etowah Mounds would remain pristine and that adjoining lands, also troves of Indian artifacts, would not be disturbed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor, who grew up in Decatur and witnessed Atlanta's sprawl from its earliest days, had no such expectations. ''The certainty is we will be surrounded,'' he said, from the bait shop at Sweetwater, which includes a 215-acre manufactured lake stocked with fish, the ruins of a Civil War-era textile factory, hiking trails and a butterfly garden. ''The uncertainty is by what.''</p>
        <p>Already, there are small subdivisions at the edges of Sweetwater Creek and a few apartment complexes, including one with placards promising that ''luxury living is a walk from the park.'' As he inspects his territory, Mr. Taylor is dismayed to find deer blinds, children's forts and yard cuttings on park property.</p>
        <p>Recently, ground was broken on the park's southern border for a mini-city called New Manchester,  which will occupy 3,350 acres on both banks of Sweetwater Creek, a tributary of the Chatahoochee River. New Manchester, named for the ruined textile factory, is to include homes for 9,000 people, office space for 25,000, a golf course, a hotel, a school and paths that connect to the trail system at the park. The enormous project does not disturb Mr. Taylor or his superiors in the State Department of Natural Resources because they say it is thoughtfully designed.</p>
        <p>''We could have a lot worse neighbors,'' Mr. Taylor said, ''and eventually we will.''</p>
        <p>He worries about an untouched tract of land adjacent to New Manchester, approved for multifamily dwellings, that has changed hands several times. Then there is the vast acreage, already bought by speculators, that is yet to be connected to the Douglas County sewer system. Once it is, Mr. Taylor said, dirt roads are likely to become four-lane highways, and forests of oak and hickory will give way to office parks.</p>
        <p>But office parks, ''if they are nicely done,'' may be preferable to housing, Mr. Taylor said, because they are in use only from 9 to 5 and tenants are unlikely to use, or misuse, the parkland. Residents, by contrast, make it difficult to ''control our borders,'' he said, and wear footpaths through delicate areas.</p>
        <p>The development at the edge of both the Etowah Indian Mounds and the Sweetwater Creek state park might have been prevented had adjoining property been bought by the state or donated by landowners. Donations of this kind are less common since changes in the tax code in 1986 made deductions for philanthropy less generous. And purchases have been stymied recently by rising costs and static public financing.</p>
        <p>Georgia's governor, Roy Barnes, a Democrat, is widely praised for initiatives to make land acquisition easier, including one that provides $300 million to the state's most rapidly developing counties for buying green space, with a goal of 20 percent per county. But Mr. Barnes is playing catch-up. ''He inherited a total mess,'' Professor Frank said.</p>
        <p>Help could also come with the resurrection of a ballot measure, which Georgia's voters rejected two years ago, to add $1 to the real estate transfer tax for land acquisition in natural areas. The fund would have yielded $30 million in its first year, said Bert Weerts, director of the state's parks and historical sites.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is pending federal legislation, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, which has passed in the House of Representatives and is expected to be considered soon by the Senate. The bill would give $450 million to the states for land acquisition, with $10 million to $18 million coming to Georgia, Mr. Weerts said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weerts was one of 32 state park executives who responded to the survey by the National Park Trust. In those 32 states, the report said, there are 94,306 acres of threatened parkland. The top 10 states -- Georgia, North Carolina, Minnesota, Nevada, West Virginia, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Montana -- account for 62,013 acres, about two-thirds of the total. Among the 18 that did not respond were California, Texas and New York, the nation's three most populous states, and Alaska, its largest.</p>
        <p>Park officials here took no offense at their ranking, instead hoping that it would draw attention to their plight. Ms. Bell, for one, would jump at any new state or federal money that would make it possible to buy land at the edges of her 54-acre historical site. The Etowah mounds were purchased for preservation in 1953, for a nominal fee, from the Tumlin family.</p>
        <p>The Tumlins, major landowners in Cartersville since 1838, have sold most of their 3,000 acres, including a 23-acre sod farm owned by Shaw Industries, one of the nation's largest carpet mills. Henry Tumlin, 83, who lives next to the park, which he once managed, has known the ''Shaw boys,'' as he calls them, since childhood, and is confident they will keep their vow to leave the land undeveloped.</p>
        <p>Given the wealth of Shaw Industries, Ms. Bell is reasonably sure that the agricultural land will not be sold.  She is less confident about the 50-acre pasture that Mr. Tumlin still owns, where cows graze within sight of a 63-foot ceremonial mound, home to Indian priests and chieftains 1,000 years ago. Mr. Tumlin and his wife, Charlsie, 84, have no children but have willed the pasture to two nephews on the condition that they keep the land in the family. One nephew is a dentist, Mrs. Tumlin said. The other is a builder.</p>
