        <p>Last year, when I was an intern, I took care of a man in his 70's with a peculiar problem: When he was sleeping, he would  periodically stop breathing. When he was awake, he was lethargic and disoriented, sometimes psychotic. No one on my team knew what was wrong with him. I still don't.</p>
        <p>One day the supervising physician, a smart and able man, was on the ward  perusing the patient's voluminous chart.  ''You know what?'' he said to me. ''One day they're going to talk about this guy like they talked about AIDS patients 20 years ago. He falls outside our paradigm. He's a real mystery.''</p>

        <p>Last year, when I was an intern, I took care of a man in his 70's with a peculiar problem: When he was sleeping, he would  periodically stop breathing. When he was awake, he was lethargic and disoriented, sometimes psychotic. No one on my team knew what was wrong with him. I still don't.</p>
        <p>One day the supervising physician, a smart and able man, was on the ward  perusing the patient's voluminous chart.  ''You know what?'' he said to me. ''One day they're going to talk about this guy like they talked about AIDS patients 20 years ago. He falls outside our paradigm. He's a real mystery.''</p>
        <p>Then he said: ''You know what he needs?  A medical student.''</p>
        <p>I must have looked puzzled. He went on: ''He needs someone who can spend time with him. Get a new history, read the chart, ask questions. You and I don't have the time. He needs someone who's going to make him their project.''</p>
        <p>I nodded, and then we got on with our work. I was caring for about 15 patients at the time. He, in addition to his teaching and research responsibilities, was seeing patients in the clinic. There didn't seem to be any time to grapple with a medical mystery.  We both realized we were failing our patient by not devoting adequate time to his problem, but we were too busy to care enough to do something about it.</p>
        <p>This case is emblematic of the environment in teaching hospitals today. Such institutions were once places that stoked intellectual curiosity, but this virtue is fast succumbing to the pressures of cost-cutting and 10-minute patient visits that affect the rest of medicine.</p>
        <p>Resident and attending physicians today are running on a treadmill that is moving faster and faster. Residents are caring for more and sicker patients, and dealing with quicker patient turnover. This is driven  partly by medical advances -- only very sick AIDS patients now require hospitalization, for example -- but mainly by the financial bottom line.</p>
        <p>Teaching hospitals have turned teaching into a business in order to survive.</p>
        <p>One of the casualties of this new environment has been largely neglected: curiosity.  Residents today are preoccupied with getting their work done. Anything that gets in the way -- even a bona fide medical mystery -- is more often seen as a bother rather than a learning opportunity. Few residents today review X-rays or CAT scans with a radiologist; instead, they rely on a written report. The job is becoming a job.</p>
        <p>It seems it wasn't always this way.</p>
        <p>A senior physician at my hospital recently told a group of residents a story from the Days of Giants, that era some older physicians recall when residents were stronger.  A resident admitted a patient to the hospital  with vague symptoms. In the morning he presented the case to the attending physician. At the end of his presentation, he said he thought the patient had lupus, a relatively obscure disease at that time. The attending replied that the resident would have to wait for the laboratory to perform a special cell stain before making the diagnosis. The resident pulled a slide out of his coat pocket.  He had done the stain by himself early that morning, despite staying up all night, confirming the diagnosis.</p>
        <p>Now, was he just an exception? Perhaps.  Still, that kind of self-direction is rare on the wards today. Are residents today just not as good as they used to be?</p>
        <p>Most older physicians I've talked to don't believe that to be the case. Medicine still attracts some of the brightest and most able  students.</p>
        <p>But profound changes have occurred in the environment of teaching hospitals, where cost containment has invariably depressed the intellectual climate.</p>
        <p>It's not just the burgeoning workload, faster patient turnover -- the average inpatient length-of-stay has dropped by 50 percent over the past few decades -- and a shortage of educational time. There are the protocols. Today on the wards, there are set standards of treatments for everything: pneumonia, asthma, heart attacks. They serve a useful purpose, employing available data to ensure that all patients receive a basic level of care. But that's not necessarily why they were designed. They cut costs.  And they teach residents to follow recipes.</p>
        <p>In his book, ''Time to Heal: American Medical Education from the Turn of the Century to the Era of Managed Care'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), Dr. Kenneth Ludmerer, an internist and a medical historian, bemoans the deterioration of the learning environment in teaching hospitals. He writes: ''Most pernicious of all from the standpoint of education, house officers to a considerable extent were reduced to work-up machines and disposition-arrangers: admitting patients and planning their discharge, one after another, with much less time than before to examine them, confer with attending physicians, teach medical students, attend conferences, read the literature, and reflect and wonder.''</p>
        <p>Today, when faced with challenging cases, residents almost reflexively call for a consultation. Many are appropriate, but many serve to avoid thinking about a hard case, because thinking takes time. We immediately called a consultation for the man who periodically stopped breathing at night, not just because we didn't know what to do, but because it was the easy way out, passing the problem on to someone who might have more time to deal with it.</p>
