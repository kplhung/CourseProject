        <p>The French carrier Air France said operating profit in the quarter ended June 30 rose 20.2 percent, to 185 million euros, or $166 million, on a 20 percent increase in revenue, to 3 billion euros, fueled by a 33 percent rise in traffic over the North Atlantic. Air France's president, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, said the increases came despite a sharp rise in fuel costs, and attributed much of the North Atlantic growth to a recently announced alliance with Delta. Net income in the quarter, the first in Air France's fiscal year, rose 85 percent, to 267 million euros, helped in part by the sale of a stake in the Amadeus reservation system.</p>
