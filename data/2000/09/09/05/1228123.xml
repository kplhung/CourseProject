        <p>The editors of two opposition newspapers in Congo are facing the death penalty.

        <p>The beleaguered editors in Congo have plenty of company. A Serbian journalist, Miroslav Filipovic, is now serving a seven-year sentence for espionage and disseminating false information after he reported on the Yugoslav Army's war crimes in Kosovo. As parliamentary elections approach in Azerbaijan, authorities have arrested the editor of an opposition newspaper on trumped-up charges that he participated in a hijacking attempt. In Paraguay a reporter was run over by a car driven by the security chief of the nation's former comptroller, who is accused of corruption.</p>
        <p>The world is seeing an epidemic of government attempts to silence independent journalists, less through murders than through legal harassment and physical threats. Paradoxically, the new repression is in some ways a sign of progress. Azerbaijan was not persecuting independent journalists 10 years ago, because it had none. Most nations now attacking journalists are quasi-democracies and so must put up with at least some independent media. But their leaders use libel suits and threats to stop reporters from investigating corruption, and often jail journalists and shut media down for tax offenses or other pretexts during political campaigns.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, respect for a free press comes with democratic development and economic growth, in part because only a robust private sector can provide enough advertising to give the media independence. But a free press is also an integral part of both kinds of progress and needs more help from the outside today. Several international groups provide lawyers for accused journalists, and independent media in places such as Serbia get a big percentage of their budgets from Western governments and nongovernmental groups. But these donors tend to concentrate on high-profile nations.</p>
        <p>Another strategy is to try to discourage attacks  by exposing them. Turkey, whose bid to join the European Union depends on its civil rights record, has responded to visits from the Committee to Protect Journalists by releasing some jailed writers and reporters. But exposure only works when governments take press freedom seriously. Liberia recently arrested a British TV crew investigating reports of diamond smuggling by President Charles Taylor. When African leaders, including Nelson Mandela, complained, Mr. Taylor released the four men.</p>
