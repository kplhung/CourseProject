        <p>In one letter, Isaac Newton, still in his 20's, sketches out the beginnings of calculus. Other scribblings show Newton's early thoughts on subjects ranging from gravity to optics to comets. If stacked up, the assemblage of letters, notebooks and other documents would be about 15 feet high.</p>
        <p>The Earl of Macclesfield, whose family has kept this collection of Newton writings for nearly three centuries, now would like to sell it for $9.5 million to the University of Cambridge, where Newton studied as an undergraduate and later worked as a professor. With the formulation of calculus and the basic equations of motion, Newton (1642-1727) set the foundation for much of modern science.</p>
        <p>Cambridge already owns most of Newton's papers, presented to the university by the Earl of Portsmouth in 1872. But if Cambridge is unable to come up with the money, some academics fret that the papers might be sold to private collectors, which is what happened with a small subset of the Portsmouth papers in 1936.</p>
        <p>''Newton was the pre-eminent scientific intellect of the last millennium, and his style of thinking is fascinating,'' Sir Martin Rees, an astrophysicist at Cambridge, said in an interview. ''By acquiring the new collection, Cambridge would be further enhancing its already pre-eminent collection of Newton's scientific writing.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Patrick Zutshi, archivist at Cambridge, said the Macclesfield papers  ''document Newton's scientific work during the most creative and productive period of his life.'' Besides preliminary work for the Principia mathematica, Newton's most important work, the collection includes letters dating mostly from 1669 to 1697. Newton's correspondents included the astronomers Edmund Halley and John Flamsteed, and the chemist and physicist Robert Boyle.</p>
        <p>Britain's Lottery Heritage Fund, which uses lottery money to preserve historical sites and artifacts, has promised to put up three-quarters of the cost, or $7.1 million. For the remainder, Cambridge is seeking donations from the public.</p>
