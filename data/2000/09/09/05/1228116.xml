        <p>A metal strip that investigators believe may have led to the fiery crash of an Air France Concorde in July apparently came from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off from the same runway minutes before the Concorde, the French agency investigating the disaster said today.</p>
        <p>The agency said Continental had reported that the same kind of metal band had been reported missing after an object gashed a tire on the supersonic jet, causing huge chunks of rubber to pierce its fuel tanks.</p>
        <p>''The characteristics of the missing piece seem identical to those of the metal piece which was found on the runway after the accident on July 25, 2000,'' a statement issued by the French agency, the Bureau of Accident Investigations, said.</p>
        <p>In a statement from its headquarters, Continental said the piece could well have come from a plane on its way to Newark International Airport from Charles de Gaulle Airport.</p>
        <p>The agency issued its statement on a day when Air France officials said that they believed that it was highly unlikely that the remaining needle-nosed jets belonging to Air France and British Air would fly again before April at the earliest.</p>
        <p>The president of Air France, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, told a news conference that a team of 20 experts was working with the government and the plane's manufacturer to try to come up with modifications that would ensure the safety of the plane. Modifications would have to be tested, and only then would Air France and British Air, the two airlines that fly Concordes, discuss whether a return to service made sense.</p>
        <p>The French agency described the piece of metal that might have caused the crash that killed 113 people as ''a part of a hood on the plane's reverse thrusters.''</p>
        <p>The investigators inspected the aircraft on Saturday in Houston, where Continental is based, officials said, accompanied by officials from Continental, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Continental said the 17-by-1-inch piece of metal found on the runway was similar in shape to a piece missing from its DC-10. The piece, the line said, was ''missing from the space between the fan reverser and the core door on the right-wing engine.''</p>
        <p>The absence of such a piece, the statement said, ''does not affect the safe operation of an aircraft.''</p>
        <p>Last week, French investigators said one of three daily runway inspections aimed at removing debris like the metal strip was skipped on the day of the crash because of a fire drill.</p>
        <p>The runway had not been thoroughly inspected for 12 hours before the supersonic took off, officials said. But in view of the fact that the Continental flight took off four minutes before the Concorde, the inspections would apparently not have prevented the disaster.</p>
