      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Antonio Hart had already worked through a number of different styles -- bebop with a free time feeling, powerhouse rhythm-and-blues, a bit of gospel -- but a song dedicated to the recently deceased pop-jazz icon Grover Washington Jr. gave him the opportunity to take his set in yet another direction.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Hart and his band did in their early show on Wednesday at Iridium was to play the syntax of pop-jazz -- the popping electric bass, the reassuringly slow and articulated melodies, the light funk rhythms, the fussy percussion instruments -- but with much more interesting harmonic material inside it. His pianist, Kevin Hays, played wide chords slowly against the pulse, and he suspended time. It was a curious transformation of a type of music that normally doesn't go very deep.</p>

        <p>Antonio Hart had already worked through a number of different styles -- bebop with a free time feeling, powerhouse rhythm-and-blues, a bit of gospel -- but a song dedicated to the recently deceased pop-jazz icon Grover Washington Jr. gave him the opportunity to take his set in yet another direction.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Hart and his band did in their early show on Wednesday at Iridium was to play the syntax of pop-jazz -- the popping electric bass, the reassuringly slow and articulated melodies, the light funk rhythms, the fussy percussion instruments -- but with much more interesting harmonic material inside it. His pianist, Kevin Hays, played wide chords slowly against the pulse, and he suspended time. It was a curious transformation of a type of music that normally doesn't go very deep.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hart's path has been a typical one for a jazz musician in his mid-30's. Signed by a major label in the early 90's when it seemed that there might be a new youth market for jazz, he's now a free agent, and he's spent a few years traveling and taking a break from leading a band: going to Cuba, as so many younger jazz musicians are doing, studying rhythm and showing up as a guest in various bands from that of the jazz bassist Dave Holland to the hip-hop performer Common's.</p>
        <p>As he played with his quintet, he was working hard. He's at least as interested in the old-style lyrical saxophone players of rhythm-and-blues, like King Curtis, as he is in the note-encrusted, fast-patterned style of Charlie Parker, and both styles came through in the set. Mr. Hart has got the modern musician's grip on harmony as well as a surging, earthy momentum and a broad sound. A few soprano-saxophone ballads from a forthcoming record on Enja indicated that he's examining how to write songs with simpler, more durable melodies, and he closed with a few burly blues choruses.</p>
        <p>Clearly Mr. Hart is in a growth period, and as he extracts different combinations of elements from the recent history of black music, he's working toward a new revision of jazz that could -- when the dust settles -- appeal directly to his own generation.</p>
