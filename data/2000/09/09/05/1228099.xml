        <p>Alcoholism, wife-beating, attention deficit disorder, suicidal thoughts -- they're not just talk show topics any more. Papa Roach, which headlined at Irving Plaza on Wednesday night, writes songs about them, with Coby Dick bellowing insights like, ''I am a mess! I've made a huge mess! I can't control myself!''</p>
        <p>Papa Roach, which has sold two million copies of its fifth album, ''Infest'' (DreamWorks), is the latest success in what might be called dysfunction rock: blaring, muscular songs that bind self-pity to aggression. It insists that beefy, pumped-up guys have feelings, too, and while they can't complain that society discriminates against them, they can still feel victimized by parents, friends and their own confusion.</p>

        <p>Alcoholism, wife-beating, attention deficit disorder, suicidal thoughts -- they're not just talk show topics any more. Papa Roach, which headlined at Irving Plaza on Wednesday night, writes songs about them, with Coby Dick bellowing insights like, ''I am a mess! I've made a huge mess! I can't control myself!''</p>
        <p>Papa Roach, which has sold two million copies of its fifth album, ''Infest'' (DreamWorks), is the latest success in what might be called dysfunction rock: blaring, muscular songs that bind self-pity to aggression. It insists that beefy, pumped-up guys have feelings, too, and while they can't complain that society discriminates against them, they can still feel victimized by parents, friends and their own confusion.</p>
        <p>''What is wrong with the world today?'' Mr. Dick sang to start the band's set. ''The government, media or your family?'' He blames the family in ''Broken Home'' and applauds a battered woman who fights back in ''Revenge.'' He reproaches himself as someone who is ''empty within'' or harboring evil impulses: ''It's in our nature to kill, kill, kill,'' he sang as the audience shouted along.</p>
        <p>Following the lead of bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach's music mixes rapping and hard rock in various proportions, switching between declamation and melody. Papa Roach has done well by leaning toward the melodic side, hoisting big singalong choruses above its double-time power chords; it also slips pert, staccato Police guitar licks into the songs. As Papa Roach moved through its checklist of talk show subjects and personal scars, fans were happy to vent along.</p>
        <p>(Hed) Planet Earth, which opened the concert, blasted through more restless rap-metal songs from its album ''Broke'' (Jive). The songs seesawed between misery and hostility while the music jumped from hard-rock stomps to cocky hip-hop, harmony choruses and desolate Nine Inch Nails-like moans. ''There's a hole in me that I can't fill no matter how hard I try,'' Jahred sang in a desperately ambivalent pickup song, ''Bartender.''</p>
        <p>The band's favorite tactic is to sling a high, dissonant, sustained guitar line and screechy turntable effects over grinding bass and drums. Where Papa Roach ignores romantic relationships, (Hed) Planet Earth includes the possibility of lust and romance in its songs, providing one more thing that can go badly wrong. Despite their derivative passages, (Hed)'s songs bristled with unresolved conflicts.</p>
        <p>The Union Underground, the middle act on the bill, tried hard to sell itself and to look dangerous. It had video screens showing bloody action footage and goose-stepping Nazis along with the band's logo, lest anyone forget whom they were watching. Its lead singer and main songwriter, Bryan Scott, proudly announced song titles like ''South Texas Deathride'' and ''Turn Me On 'Mr. Deadman,' '' while also repeating the title of the band's album at least five times. But the songs themselves were mediocre and shopworn, intent on simplifying the bleak tone of Alice in Chains into a Texas boogie. Mr. Scott went through the motions of someone whipping up an enthusiastic crowd, ignoring an audience that heckled more and more loudly.</p>
