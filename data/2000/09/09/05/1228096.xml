        <p>A sea of music fanatics and thrill-seekers drink and sway blissfully to songs of peace and love in a muddy field. It could be a Grateful Dead concert, or Woodstock just half a world away. Call it Woodstock on the Volga.</p>
        <p>Every summer thousands of Russians make the journey to the Grushinsky Festival, known as Grusha for short, held on a riverbank between two cities, Samara and Tolyatti, Russia's auto industry center. The festival celebrates bard music, a genre identified with the Soviet cultural thaw of the 1960's and the subsequent growth and popularity of allegorical songs as a creative and spiritual outlet. Today conditions are different, but the songs of contemporary bard musicians seem to serve a similar comforting purpose.</p>
        <p>Various theories trace the origins of bard music to Soviet prison camp songs, soldiers' ballads, prerevolutionary romances and even the songs of the wandering minstrels of centuries ago. Some bard songs even sound like American country music, but by any measure, Russians are much more likely than the average American to pick up a guitar and sing with their friends, all of whom have dozens, sometimes hundreds of songs committed to memory. It's all part of the seemingly infinite national capacity to recite verse.</p>
        <p>Fans of bard songs even sound like Deadheads when they talk about what the music means to them. One of those soaking up the vibes with his wife and two small sons at this year's festival was Mikhail Ovcharenko, owner of a bodyguard service in Samara. ''People don't communicate with each other enough,'' Mr. Ovcharenko said. ''We live in a big crowd. Here everyone is equal, everyone is naked.''</p>
        <p>''Songs always unite,'' he added. ''Everyone sings the same song. Everyone is singing in the same harmony, in unison. Maybe that's why there's such energy here. These songs are kind, they're about love and family. Maybe it's a difficult time, maybe these are cruder times, but here we're in concert.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovcharenko enjoyed music and vodka around a makeshift picnic table built with friends who have been going to the festival for 20 years. Their leader, Valery Klyushkin, arrives two weeks in advance to stake out their favorite spot. Every little tent city has its own whimsical name, usually an inside joke, and its own traditions, united by a repertory of the best-loved bard songs and other musical favorites, like the Beatles. ''What we hear here lasts us for the whole year,'' Mr. Klyushkin said.</p>
        <p>This summer's 20th anniversary of the death of Vladimir Vysotsky, a beloved actor and bard, has produced a host of television retrospectives and concerts in his memory. Vysotsky's angry songs about the degradation of Soviet life, sung in his raspy voice at private gatherings and passed around on hissing reel-to-reel recordings, were the soundtrack to a thwarted generation.</p>
        <p>''My life, a dumb thing,'' he sang of himself in one of his last songs. Since his death from alcohol-induced heart failure, Vysotsky's lyrics have all been published, a monument of him in a Christlike pose has been put up in central Moscow, and he is regarded as a kind of people's poet, quoted as often as Aleksandr Pushkin and by a broader swath of people.</p>
        <p>But for all the enduring popularity of Vysotsky and other bards, the genre has been declared dead as often as rock music has in the United States. Critics charge that it has sold out to the saccharine dictates of the market and been taken over by a pseudocollective spirit that undermines the music. Some critics are especially irritated by the fashion for singing bard songs in chorus.</p>
        <p>''Now bard singing is like fascism,'' said Aleksandr Marchenko, a Moscow musician and composer who has created arrangements for contemporary bards. ''It's a chamber genre meant to be sung in the kitchen. Now they want to make it into a mass genre and say it's so spiritual.''</p>
        <p>Even so, ''Songs of Our Century,'' a two-part easy-listening collection of classics performed by popular bards in chorus and with instrumentals, has topped Spice Girl knockoffs on the Russian pop charts and inspired knockoffs and pirated editions of its own. Helped by word of mouth, the first recording sold nearly 100,000 cassettes and CD's a month when it was released in early 1999, unheard of in Russia's struggling, payola-plagued pop music industry.</p>
        <p>The bards behind ''Songs of Our Century'' call their work a mission. ''In a time when the animal instinct rules, we must stand against this,'' Sergei Nikitin told an audience of several thousand at the start of a concert tour promoting part two of the collection. ''I am absolutely certain these songs will live in the 21st century.''</p>
        <p>Galina Khomchik, a singer in the project who performs cover versions of other bards, says that Russians today suffer from a lack of honest friendship and love and that bard songs help compensate for the lack of spirituality.</p>
        <p>Such qualities, it seems, are in demand outside Russia as well. The concert tour has gone to New York, Seattle and San Francisco, where emigres nostalgic for the bard tradition have sung along to their favorite songs. Even non-Russians in former Soviet republics still sing to the bards, in Russian, underscoring that it is a quintessentially Soviet genre. Bards from Russia also tour the Baltic countries, and festivals are held in Ukraine and Central Asia.</p>
        <p>The Web site www.bards.ru, based in Krasnoyarsk in Siberia, has the lyrics to 17,000 bard songs. In Moscow huge halls that do not always sell out for pop stars are packed for the bards, and several bard cafes serve blini and vodka to accompany live performances in an intimate setting.</p>
        <p>For the first time, in fact, bards are becoming professional musicians who make a living performing. But hundreds of so-called amateur song clubs around Russia remain centers of the bard movement, which the Communist Party once tried to control.</p>
        <p>''Our club was closed three times in Soviet times,'' said a Smolensk bard, Aleksandr Makarenkov, who recalls having to get the censor's approval for songs to be performed at festivals. In poorer provincial cities like Smolensk, which is near the Belorussian border, it is now lack of money that makes life hard for local bards. As for the words, freedom of expression sometimes means they have less of a message to convey.</p>
        <p>''If before people sang in allegories, now we can speak openly,'' said Sergei Pogorely, a bard from Karelia, a region bordering Finland. ''Something has even been lost with this possibility, just as literature has suffered.'' Bard songs suffered less, he said, because they are one of the most democratic kinds of Russian literature. And politics and pain are not completely absent from today's lyrics. A song about the war in Chechnya took first place at a bard festival in St. Petersburg this spring.</p>
        <p>Stas Stanyulevich, a wholesale dairy products distributor who organizes a festival in a forest outside Moscow in the early autumn, says that what used to be a way of escaping the authorities has became a way to fill a void that money cannot satisfy. ''Before it was dangerous to talk in the city; the authorities didn't allow it,'' Mr. Stanyulevich said. ''So people came out into the woods, where they could talk and sing freely. In the first years of reform, there was such a rush to make money. Now people either have it or they don't. If they don't, they realize they won't. If they do, they want to relax.</p>
        <p>''Nouveau-riche Russians come out here with a car full of vodka. Adventure travel has become very popular, the more extreme the better. Now they want something for the soul.''</p>
