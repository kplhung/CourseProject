        <p>The first game is all about striding toward establishing an identity. Usually, 8 to 12 games are required to decide what your team is and what it does best.</p>
        <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, however, have passed that curve after only one game.</p>
        <p>This team is all about defense. And it knows it.</p>
        <p>So, after it strangled the New England Patriots' offense in a 21-16 road victory on Sunday, the Buccaneers' defensive players held court in their locker room. Keyshawn Johnson may be the new, special and bright shiny ornament on the team, but it is clear with this bunch that he is not the tree.</p>
        <p>''I have seldom seen a defense like this,'' Johnson said after Tampa Bay's defense produced six sacks, hammered everyone in the Patriots' backfield and played most of the game there, persistently pursuing the ball. It was responsible for allowing only 9 of New England's points, with the other 7 scored off a punt return. And it made sure the Patriots' final pass, from the Buccaneers' 22 with one second to play, fell harmlessly out of the end zone.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay is 25-2 in its last 27 games in which it led entering the fourth quarter. That is how good this defense is at winning games.</p>
        <p>Tampa Bay's offensive players see this defense every day in practice. They know.</p>
        <p>''I knew that in that last situation there, our defense was not going to allow New England to score and take the game,'' fullback Mike Alstott said. ''I thought they would let them complete a pass and maybe stop them before the goal line or just not let it get caught in the end zone. They were back there, ready, prepared. And the guys up front put on enough pressure to force a quicker throw. This defense has a lot of pride. They make things happen. They are awesome.''</p>
        <p>They were supposed to be weaker without  two fixtures, linebacker Hardy Nickerson and end Brad Culpepper, a free-agent loss and a salary-cap casualty. But the unit looks strong, regardless. It covers the middle, the flanks, with aplomb. It outhustles and outhits most offenses. The front four, led by tackle Warren Sapp, is brutal. The best linebacker is Derrick Brooks, a ferocious hitter. The secondary is directed by safety John Lynch, athletic, smart, energetic and full of desire.</p>
        <p>The defense is shaped in the image of Tony Dungy, the Tampa Bay coach, who as a player and a coach learned a few tricks about defense from Chuck Noll and the Pittsburgh Steelers. Give Dungy, Monte Kiffin, the defensive coordinator, and this defense 21 points a game, and Tampa Bay will not lose often.</p>
        <p>It might not be the Steel Curtain, but it is a brick wall.</p>
        <p>And now this defense is stepping up and stepping out. That is the Keyshawn factor.</p>
        <p>Some of the same reasons the Jets' new regime booted Johnson -- his bravado, his mouth, his Hollywood qualities -- are some of the same reasons he fits perfectly with the, over all, once mild and meek Buccaneers. This Tampa Bay defense has watched Johnson, how he confidently carries himself in and out of rooms and in and out of games. That trait of Johnson's is creeping around the Tampa Bay locker room. It is being absorbed by the Buccaneers' defensive players.</p>
        <p>They are becoming more confident, stronger and louder. More certain of their place on this team and in this season.</p>
        <p>Sapp, of course, has always been able to duke and jab in the spotlight. But here comes the rest of the defense, wonderful players like end Chidi Ahanotu and cornerback Ronde Barber, up and down the lineup, growing in confidence and certain of their identity -- the best defense in pro football.</p>
        <p>Sapp agreed, saying, ''Yep, that's who we are.''</p>
        <p>In a season where big-play offenses are featured and in a climate where piling up points is popular, the Buccaneers are eager to see how far this defense will take them. All they way home, they hope, to Super Bowl XXXV, which will be played at their stadium.</p>
        <p>In the National Football League, knowing exactly who you are is a prerequisite to getting where you want to go.</p>
        <p>Another team that leapt toward establishing its identity on opening day was the Philadelphia Eagles. It wants to play the game young and fun, daring and aggressive.</p>
        <p>The Eagles kicked an onside kick on the opening kickoff, recovered and then drove for a touchdown. Those were the first of an avalanche of points scored in their 41-14 demolition of Dallas.</p>
        <p>It was 109 degrees at Texas Stadium, and Dallas shriveled. Because of a concussion, Troy Aikman will most likely not play at Arizona on Sunday. Receiver Joey Galloway was lost for the season with a knee injury. But Eagles back Duce Staley rushed for 201 yards, including 60 on his last carry, his 26th of the day. That is staying power.</p>
        <p>Do the Eagles have it?</p>
        <p>''We wanted to send a message -- to both teams,'' Coach Andy Reid said of the game's opening play and the day.</p>
        <p>Message received. Dallas allowed the most rushing yards (306) in its history.</p>
        <p>Reid arrived from Green Bay as an offensive specialist, but he is making the Eagles tougher and stronger, carving them into a physical and attacking team. Come December, the Eagles hope that will be a lasting identity.</p>
        <p>You might not have recognized some of these teams on Sunday, too. The makings of new identities all around:</p>
        <p>MIAMI -- It survived the first game without Dan Marino and found a running back (Lamar Smith, 145 rushing yards), too, bombing Seattle, 23-0.</p>
        <p>MINNESOTA -- Daunte Culpepper showed his big arm and his robust legs at quarterback, rushing for three touchdowns in a 30-27 victory over Chicago. He could be the first rushing quarterback of his kind who can break tackles and dispense blows like a running back or a tight end.</p>
        <p>BUFFALO -- Searching for revenge since last season, it got it against Tennessee, 16-13. Now it can finally move forward.</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON -- It took only one game -- a 20-17 victory over Carolina -- for Coach Norv Turner to look around and see that this team is unlike any of his others in Washington. He has leaders now, true professionals in players like Bruce Smith and Mark Carrier and Deion Sanders, and for Turner, that is refreshing, exciting. Now, with that professional attitude teamwide and with so much talent, Turner can simply coach.</p>
        <p>For all of these teams and for some of the other winners on Sunday, it was only one game, that first game.</p>
        <p>But each adores the first strokes of the new makeovers.</p>
