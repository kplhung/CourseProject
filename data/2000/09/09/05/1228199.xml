        <p>After Todd Martin managed to conclude his rain-suspended match against 10th-seeded Cedric Pioline yesterday, he was asked at his news conference about unforced errors in his 7-6 (5), 6-3, 6-2 victory.</p>
        <p>''I don't know the one you're referring to,'' said Martin, who advanced to the fourth round.</p>
        <p>''I can't remember,'' the reporter admitted.</p>
        <p>Martin understood. ''We're both getting old,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It's true. Martin's gray-flecked hair often makes him appear older than his 30 years, and his smooth but unspectacular game can make him seem like a grandfather on the court, creaky and old fashioned.</p>
        <p>Martin knows that some fans find his style of play stuffy, in contrast to someone like, say, Pete Sampras.</p>
        <p>''Pete plays a lot of his tennis the same why I do, but then there's another side of his tennis that's leaping and bounding and running and slapping and these things which, if I wanted to do that, I could,'' Martin said. ''I'd be unemployed, but I could do that.''</p>
        <p>For now, Martin will stick with his solid serves and smart shot placement, and continue clocking in for at least another round. It is becoming a familiar routine for the No. 32-ranked Martin, who last year advanced to the Open final before falling to Andre Agassi.</p>
        <p>Now, coming to the end of a shaky season in which he fell in the first round of the French Open and lost in the second round of Wimbledon and the Australian Open, Martin is seeking to regain his balance.</p>
        <p>So far it seems to be working.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I'm playing better than I did last year,'' he said. ''I'm optimistic that I can do well if my game sustains as it is.''</p>
