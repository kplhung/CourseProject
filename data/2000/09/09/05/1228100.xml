        <p>It was the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere, and under a frigid Nevada sky about 75 men and women wearing nothing but body paint and their own bravado were cavorting on the barren lake bed here in temperatures that would make your average coyote flinch.</p>
        <p>The occasion was the first -- and only -- performance of ''Phallus of the Man and Yoni Gate,'' an electronic opera composed by Pepe Ozan, dealing with the complex relationships between men and women and of course the lost city of Atlantis. Besides the naked dancers, the opera featured two abstract sculptures of genitals, a calypso band and a narrator prone to lines like ''We now must consult the Atlantian mystic.'' All of which left its standing-room-only crowd -- there are no seats in the desert -- with a profound sense of awe.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what it means,'' said one smiling spectator who would not divulge his name. ''But it sure is different.''</p>
        <p>That sentiment was the common refrain and attraction of many of the 25,000 visitors who flooded this year's Burning Man festival, the annual alternative-arts fair that has steadily become one of the nation's foremost showcases for art of the obscure, the outrageous and the just plain odd.</p>
        <p>The festival, which ended on Monday after a weeklong run on this arid strip of desert some 120 miles north of Reno, has an artistic manifesto of ''radical self-expression.'' Visitors looking for surreal sights were not likely to be disappointed.</p>
        <p>The festival was founded in 1986 by Larry Harvey, a Bay Area artist who built and cremated an eight-foot-tall effigy of a man on Baker Beach in San Francisco. The annual ritual quickly evolved into a popular summer festival for artists and hipsters, and over the years Mr. Harvey's simple effigy has grown into a 40-foot wood and neon extravaganza, burned to cheers of thousands of rabid fans on the Saturday before Labor Day.</p>
        <p>The gathering moved here in 1990 after crowds and fire worries prompted organizers to seek more wide open spaces. As news of the festival has spread, Burning Man has become a yearly pilgrimage for thousands of performers and artists as well as Internet techies, adventurous yuppies and other counterculture aficionados, many of whom trek hundreds or even thousands of miles to attend. Flags from Sweden, Israel, Italy and Ireland billowed over camps this year, as did rainbow banners and pirate skulls.</p>
        <p>On a walk across the desert fairgrounds, called ''the playa,'' a casual visitor might encounter anything from a school of neon fish suspended by wire on the heads of a dozen bicyclists to a 50-foot-long mechanical dragon replete with fire-breathing skills and with a New Orleans brass band playing ''You Are My Sunshine'' inside its metal gut. Turn the other way, and you may  find yourself facing a satyr, an angel or maybe just another naked person. (It's not just opera anymore.)</p>
        <p>Elsewhere cars with complete cocktail lounges mounted on their frames zipped across the desert plain and an R.V. outfitted with a pair of 15-foot Tesla coils spit tendrils of lightning into the air. There was even more traditional work like ''The Faces of Man,'' by Dan Das Mann, with a series of three tall sculptures made of wood, copper and grass. Turned toward the center of the camp, the copper face also included a pair of burning eyes from which a steady stream of burning fuel fell. And there were the spontaneous entertainments, ranging from campfire conga sessions to heartfelt post-Beat poetry.</p>
        <p>''It's the ultimate in freedom and expression,'' said Darin Greyerbiehl, a San Franciscan who was standing outside his campsite watching some 300 topless women, all decorated with variously colored swirls of the festival's ubiquitous body paint, ride by on bicycles. ''You can either go look for it, or wait and it'll come to you. Either way it's something you're not going to see anywhere else.''</p>
        <p>One Burning Man volunteer who went by the name Swervegirl said: ''Gearheads, punks, freaks, geeks, hippies -- they all come here. It is radically inclusive.''</p>
        <p>The festival's free-to-be-you-and-me attitude attracts a variety of other pleasure seekers, namely middle-aged nudists and other sexual adventurers. Not surprisingly it also draws many fans of illegal psychedelic drugs like LSD and ecstasy. Officers from the Bureau of Land Management, which shares with local police jurisdiction over the land where the festival is held, issued about three dozen citations for drug use, said Jim Graham, a festival spokesman. He said there were also a handful of arrests on drug charges.</p>
        <p>Burning Man officials say their event is unique among alternative events, pointing out its duration -- a week, not a night -- and its emphasis on community. The age range of Burning Man visitors also tends to be older, with about half falling between 25 and 35 and at least 10 percent older than 45. That range might be a result of the festival's sometimes steep entrance fees -- this year's latecomers paid $250 -- a price that Burning Man officials say is justified by the cost of renting the land, fulfilling federal environmental obligations and running the camp.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most significant, there are the daily challenges of the desert, where temperatures can soar above 110 degrees by midday and then plummet to near freezing at night. (Burning Man may be the only festival in the world where the ticket stub reads, ''You voluntarily assume the risk of serious injury or death by attending.'')</p>
        <p>The weather during the weekend festivities included torrential rains, a six-hour dust storm and overnight temperatures in the low 40's. About 1,000 people left on Friday after 50-mile-an-hour winds ripped up tent stakes and sent desert detritus flying. Several events were postponed or canceled because of weather.</p>
        <p>Being desert bound, Burning Man visitors also trade amenities like indoor plumbing and running water for the less glamorous trappings of propane stoves and overflowing Port-a-Potties. Ice and water are at a premium. Dust-caked hair and mud-battered shoes are the norm, as are dust masks when the wind kicks up billowing clouds of white sand. Tents are packed side to side, and noise often echoes through the night.</p>
        <p>Laid out on a giant circular grid stretching across five square miles, the festival campgrounds, called Black Rock City, include a 24-hour cafe (latte: $3), an airstrip, a pair of daily newspapers, a medical area and more than half a dozen ham radio stations. The city is divided into streets and avenues, complete with street signs. In the center of the circle is a large area devoted to the outdoor sculpture that is the festival's defining symbol, the 40-foot Burning Man.</p>
        <p>Those near the center of the circle are asked to establish ''theme camps,'' with attractions ranging from trampoline sports to a yoga center devoted to Elvis. Many of these camps are elaborate, with mini-nightclubs and lounges tucked into tents and outdoor stages flowing from the fronts of trailers. Other theme camps include steel towers, wooden pyramids or makeshift movie houses. What results is a giant circular promenade dotting the desert night with flashing lights and pounding music.</p>
        <p>As the mishmash of images might suggest, there is little stock put in creating a cohesive message about the festival. Press material for the festival, in fact, goes to lengths to say what Burning Man is not, including  ''a pagan event,'' ''a 90's Woodstock'' or ''a hippie festival.'' Organizers prefer to call the festival ''a populist phenomenon,'' ''a social experiment'' and ''an alternative to mass culture and consumer society.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, however, the only populist phenomenon at work seemed to be pyromania. After ''the Burn,'' as the immolation of the Burning Man is called, artists took turns torching their own work, all to raucous cheers. Crowds roamed across the playa from fire to fire, warming their hands against the flames and basking in the satisfaction of another successful festival. In the distance neon fish zipped and Tesla coils zapped, and primitive screams filled the night. It was, in short, a scene to inspire big thoughts.</p>
        <p>''If you carry nothing else away from this,'' said Mr. Greyerbiehl, ''it's that this is a shining beacon for where the world could go.''</p>
