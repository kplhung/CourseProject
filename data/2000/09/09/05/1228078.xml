        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I disagree with an Aug. 30 letter recommending taxing air travel during peak times to offset congestion. The writer suggests that the revenues could subsidize off peak travel and that the tax would be borne mostly by business travelers who will benefit from the increased efficiency.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I disagree with an Aug. 30 letter recommending taxing air travel during peak times to offset congestion. The writer suggests that the revenues could subsidize off peak travel and that the tax would be borne mostly by business travelers who will benefit from the increased efficiency.</p>
        <p>As a small business owner who closely watches his cash flow, I can't justify paying more so that tourists can fly at cheaper rates. This idea is another example of how small businesses are lost in the noisy tax battle that pits large corporations against wage earners but ignores the voices of those in between.</p>
        <p>A better idea would be to require airlines to give a price reduction every time a flight is canceled or delayed. I guarantee that a solution would then be found very quickly.</p>
