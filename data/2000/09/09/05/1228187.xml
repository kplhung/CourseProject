        <p>In wheelchairs, on crutches and standing shoelace-deep in the mud, several thousand Latino evangelicals waited nearly all afternoon yesterday in a South Bronx park for a former bodybuilder turned faith healer who is widely known as the Spanish-speaking Billy Graham.</p>
        <p>When the Rev. Yiye Avila, a wiry 74-year-old Puerto Rican with steel gray hair, finally showed up on stage in St. Mary's Park,  he was nearly two and a half hours late. Still, the wait was far from over. He had hardly begun to speak when the sky darkened and a late summer shower exploded into a drenching downpour.</p>
        <p>''We are going to pray so that God will bring out the sun, the moon and the stars,'' said Mr. Avila, who retreated from the rain to pray beneath a canopy as his followers, soaked and muddy, waited patiently for yet another hour. Still, no one complained or even seemed discouraged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Avila, a fiery preacher who paces the stage feverishly, speaking of God, the Devil and miracles of faith, is a crowd-pleasing force behind one of the major religious shifts among American Hispanics in the last quarter century.</p>
        <p>His satellite-powered ministry, heard on television and radio across much of the United States and Latin America, has played a significant role in converting hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholic Latinos to evangelical Protestant denominations.</p>
        <p>''The equivalent of one out of seven Hispanics has left Catholicism in a little more than a quarter of a century,'' the Rev. Andrew M. Greeley wrote two years ago in America, the Catholic weekly. He estimated that about 600,000 Hispanics are lost to the church every year, adding that ''if this hemorrhage should continue for the next 25 years, half of all American Hispanics will not be Catholic.''</p>
        <p>Father Greeley described the loss as ''the worst defection in the history of the Catholic Church in the United States.''</p>
        <p>A report last year by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops acknowledged that the migration of Catholic Hispanics to other denominations was a substantial threat to the future of the church in the United States. The report said that evangelical preachers were succeeding by skillfully linking Scripture to everyday experience and by instructing believers on a strict code of behavior that gives sense to their lives.</p>
        <p>When the rain finally stopped yesterday and Mr. Avila resumed speaking, he told the audience of his conversion to evangelical Christianity when he was a young man in Puerto Rico, where he had been a minor-league baseball player and a professional bodybuilder. He won the Mr. North America title in 1954.</p>
        <p>Rheumatoid arthritis was threatening to cripple him until the night he caught the evangelist Oral Roberts preaching on television. He then dedicated his life to God and, he said, his arthritis disappeared. Mr. Avila told the crowd in the Bronx yesterday that sometimes it is good to watch television.</p>
        <p>Among the soggy celebrants in St. Mary's Park, there was no shortage of former Catholics eager to explain the appeal of preachers like Mr. Avila.</p>
        <p>''I found that when I went to Catholic church it was like they were reading a book,'' said Sonia Castro, 40, a bank teller in Brooklyn who travels three hours each way by subway, train and bus to attend the Christian Charismatic Church in Elizabeth, N.J. ''But at my church, it is like I feel the Holy Spirit wrapping his arms around me.''</p>
        <p>And then there were the miracles,  or at least the promise of miracles, that brought dozens of believers in wheelchairs to listen to Mr. Avila, who for nearly four decades has been preaching in major Latino urban centers across the United States. In the park, those hoping for miracles sat close to the stage, on Mr. Avila's left.</p>
        <p>Alicia Santiago, 40, a home-care provider who lives in the Bronx, took Janice Santos, who is 6 and has cerebral palsy, to the park.</p>
        <p>''I came to see if he does work miracles,'' said Ms. Santiago, who grew up Catholic. ''Maybe he can work a miracle for her.''</p>
        <p>Many others in the crowd spoke of the clarity that evangelical beliefs bring to their lives.</p>
        <p>''The Catholics, they drink and they dance,'' said Pablo Padillo, 68, a retired truck driver from the Bronx who was raised a Catholic but now describes himself as a Pentecostal. ''When you accept Jesus, you don't do any of those things.''</p>
        <p>The essence of Mr. Avila's appeal, especially for recent immigrants, is that he makes sense of what for many is a hard and confusing life in the United States, according to the Rev. Isaac J. Canales, a pastor and theologian in Carson, Calif.</p>
        <p>''His is a very simple, hopeful and conservative message,'' said Mr. Canales, who has spent a number of years analyzing Mr. Avila's ministry. ''He preaches the value of hard work, success and prosperity in a message that is Christ-centered and miracle-oriented.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Canales, who is the pastor of a 1,500-member Assembly of God church, said that Mr. Avila was widely admired and welcomed by evangelical pastors because he not only excited Hispanics about Christianity, he also encouraged them to attend their local churches.</p>
        <p>Mr. Avila was invited by the New York Hispanic Clergy Organization. Its president, the Rev. Ruben Diaz, said that he hoped Mr. Avila's message would, among other things, help reduce crime in the Bronx.</p>
