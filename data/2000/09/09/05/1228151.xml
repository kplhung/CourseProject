        <p>As they have for years on Labor Day, tens of thousands of New Yorkers, and the politicians who court them, descended on Brooklyn yesterday to watch or take part in the West Indian American Carnival Parade in Crown Heights, with the city's largest street spectacle dampened only by a sudden downpour that brought a brief halt to the festivities.</p>
        <p>As in other years, people ate curried goat and rice balls. They danced along the sidewalks to Caribbean music blaring from all corners.

They wore primary-colored costumes native to Caribbean islands and rode on floats festooned with bamboo, crepe paper and silver paint.</p>

        <p>As they have for years on Labor Day, tens of thousands of New Yorkers, and the politicians who court them, descended on Brooklyn yesterday to watch or take part in the West Indian American Carnival Parade in Crown Heights, with the city's largest street spectacle dampened only by a sudden downpour that brought a brief halt to the festivities.</p>
        <p>As in other years, people ate curried goat and rice balls. They danced along the sidewalks to Caribbean music blaring from all corners. They wore bright yellow feathers, straw hats and T-shirts purchased streetside that said things like, ''Not only am I perfect, I'm Vincentian too!'' They wore primary-colored costumes native to Caribbean islands and rode on floats festooned with bamboo, crepe paper and silver paint.</p>
        <p>But unlike in other years, what they did not do was drink alcohol at the event, at least not legally. The Giuliani administration banned alcohol from the festival and other large parades this year, drawing protests from organizers who argued that the ban would hobble those participants whose costumes and floats were supported by alcohol companies.</p>
        <p>Organizers and participants were further annoyed that the city has said it will permit some alcohol at other street events, like the Feast of San Gennaro, an 11-day festival in Little Italy that starts later this month. Liquor will be sold at the festival by a reduced number of vendors.</p>
        <p>But the ban, however resented, did not seem to dampen the spirits of participants or those who came to watch them; few people who were interviewed seemed, in fact, to much care.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't make any difference to me,'' said Eloise Leslie, 73, who lives on Eastern Parkway. ''People come out here to relieve themselves of depression and anxiety they feel all year long. They don't need alcohol for that, just the music and their own spirits.''</p>
        <p>Others saw a silver lining. ''To be out here without having people throwing beer cans at you is kind of nice as far as I'm concerned,'' said Errol Hassell, a mechanic from the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the parade was generally free of trouble, although by 6 p.m., when it formally ended, five people had been arrested. These included a woman charged with biting a Secret Service agent protecting Hillary Rodham Clinton, and two men charged with sexual abuse.</p>
        <p>While beer might have been banned, there were plenty of other things on offer along the route: whistles, homemade carrot cakes, hats, codfish fritters, Barbie dolls, Jesus and socialism. And plenty of corporations showed their colors: Citibank and Chase Manhattan had floats, as did Western Union, which, according to its sign, ''Does More for the Caribbean Community than Simply Sending Money.''</p>
        <p>Brooklyn's West Indian parade draws an estimated two million people, compared with the roughy million or so who come out for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>As such, it proves a fine spot for politicians to make their rounds. This year, Mrs. Clinton was in attendance; her rival for a Senate seat from New York, Rick A. Lazio, spent his day upstate. The city's public advocate, Mark Green, shook hands, and many of his own body parts, as he made his way through Brooklyn to the sound of banging drums. Una Clarke, who is seeking to unseat her onetime mentor, Representative Major R. Owens, appeared energized to the end of the parade, where she continued to yell out, ''We need some resources in this community!''</p>
        <p>When the city announced the alcohol ban and other new rules for large parades last month, officials said they were in part a response to accidents that killed three people who attended last year's parade. Two 11-year-old dancers were killed, and another child was hurt, when they were struck by a van, and an 18-year-old man was killed by a sound truck. Parade organizers protested that alcohol use was not implicated in any of the accidents.</p>
        <p>Despite the ill feeling caused by his administration's decision, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did not shy away from marching yesterday.</p>
        <p>The mayor was greeted with a cascade of catcalls and boos as he made his way down Eastern Parkway. ''What are you doing here? We don't need you here,'' yelled Hugh Gardner, a 37-year-old Flatbush resident, as the mayor walked by his spot along the parkway. ''You're a bum.''</p>
        <p>The mayor seemed undaunted, smiling as he made his way along with police escorts, occasionally venturing toward the crowd to shake hands. There were a few voices of dissent. One woman, who declined to give her name, said that even though she did not support the mayor, ''It was the right thing for him to be here.''</p>
        <p>By parade's end, the authorities said, 21 bottle of alcoholic beverages and 20 cases of beer had been confiscated, and 35 open-container summonses issued.</p>
        <p>The woman accused of biting a Secret Service agent in the arm was identified by the police as Yolande Bobb, 55, of Brooklyn, who was charged with second-degree assault. The incident occurred as Ms. Bobb was approaching Mrs. Clinton and the agent interceded, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Claudis Jacob, 40, of Brooklyn, was charged with abusing a 13-year-old girl and held on sexual abuse charges. Cecil Wayland of Brooklyn, 40, was also charged with sexual abuse, accused of abusing a 24-year-old woman.</p>
        <p>In mid-afternoon, the festivities were interrupted by a heavy downpour. For about 20 minutes, vendors took refuge under their tables and bright colored feathers were soaked as the fierce rain storm made its way through Brooklyn. Rain drops fell heavily into pans of food and corner bodegas filled with people from the crowd. But as soon as the sun came out, the crush of humans appeared to grow thicker than ever.</p>
        <p>''I have really enjoyed this parade,'' said Stanley Davis, a 45-year-old onlooker who cleans streets during his regular life. ''It is alcohol-free but still fun to me.''</p>
