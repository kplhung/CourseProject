        <p>BUT will he kill the box office?</p>
        <p>On Broadway these days, that's the only question they ask Bruce Brandwen, the founder, president and chief executive of the Broadway Television Network. That is because this Sunday, he will brave theatrical controversy to kick off his new venture: broadcasting Broadway musicals live to pay-per-view audiences.</p>
        <p>The problem here is that memories are long on the Great White Way. Producers still have flashbacks to the early 1970's, when Joseph Papp's production of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' suffered an early death at the Winter Garden Theater after being nationally televised. The word ''cannibalized'' was employed.</p>
        <p>The first show Mr. Brandwen will broadcast, on Sunday at 9 p.m., is ''Smokey Joe's Cafe: The Songs of Leiber and Stoller,'' the long-running rock 'n' roll revue. Mr. Brandwen taped the show in January, during its last performance.</p>
        <p>O.K., it isn't a live broadcast of a current show. ''We went off plan to capture this on tape, because it was such a great opportunity,'' said Mr. Brandwen, 54. But he says his next offering, in January (to be announced), will be broadcast live from a Broadway stage.</p>
        <p>Will this kill ticket sales? ''That is the knee-jerk question,'' he said, ''and it's old. It's time that Broadway added the electronic component, like film and football and auto racing have,'' he said of traditionally successful endeavors that videoed up.</p>
        <p>There has been no drop in the sale of $1,500 courtside New York Knicks seats ''while the game is offered free on television,'' he said. Ditto for baseball games and the decades-old public-television series ''Live From Lincoln Center.''</p>
        <p>The cost of his offerings, initially $24.95 per household, is steep in comparison with pay-cable movies, but a steal considering Broadway musical ticket prices, which, according to Weekly Variety, average in the $60 range, including discounts.</p>
        <p>Under the ''Live From Broadway, One Night Only'' rubric, ''Smokey Joe'' will be offered to 2,000 cable systems in the United States, Canada and Central and South America with a potential audience of 35 million households. It will also be carried on satellite systems with a potential audience of eight million homes.</p>
        <p>The taping involved a crew of 60, using 11 cameras. ''We want to capture a show on the Broadway stage before a paying audience the way Fox or CBS captures a football game,'' he said. ''It'll be the next best thing to being there.''</p>
        <p>The productions will be offered in high definition and surround sound (the home-theater-audience sound system). Mr. Brandwen's five-year plan (offering three or four productions a year) has ''no expectation of an overnight success,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jed Bernstein, president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, said: ''Anything that exposes Broadway to a larger audience of current and potential customers is a good thing. The question of whether it will kill the box office has not yet been answered. But the industry must continue to find other ways for customers to touch the theater art form, outside of sitting in a theater.''</p>
        <p>YET some producers need persuading. ''I'm doubtful that it would be benign and would not affect box offices negatively,'' said Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center Theater now and the associate producer of ''Much Ado About Nothing'' in 1973. The televised version of that show ''took what had been a reasonably successful box office attraction and cut into it sufficiently to force us to close.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brandwen countered by mentioning ''Riverdance,'' which became a success on Broadway after it was broadcast on public television and sold millions of videocassettes.</p>
        <p>Presumably, the Broadway Television Network can find other producers willing to take the risk. The privately held company's investors include four Broadway powers: the Shubert Organization, the Nederlander Organization, Jujamcyn Theaters and SFX Entertainment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brandwen spent four years negotiating multiyear collective bargaining agreements with 14 Broadway labor unions. ''Everyone gets a payment,'' he said. No Broadway show will be offered live on pay-per-view until six months after its debut.</p>
        <p>The union agreements were easy  ''because I'm a city guy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed. Mr. Brandwen is such a New Yorker ''that I tell cabdrivers not only how to get there, but what lane they should be in.'' Such a man would live, of course, in Manhattan, where his wife, Jacqueline, teaches at Public School 191.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brandwen grew up in Sunnyside, Queens, son of Joseph, a former assistant United States attorney who became a real estate lawyer, and Marjorie, the public stenographer of Queens County. His father, a piano player in his spare time, took the family to many a Broadway show.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Brandwen began churning out network, cable, syndication and home-video productions. By 1995, the number of pay-per-view homes reached a hefty broadcast universe of 20 million and ''I began thinking that this could work,'' he said of the Broadway idea.</p>
        <p>These days, heavyweight fights can draw 1.8 million pay-per-viewers; first-run movies, which are broadcast 30 times a month, can attract 100,000 homes. Mr. Brandwen's expectations are ''far more modest,'' he said. But do the math: $24.95 times 50,000 homes exceeds $1.2 million. ''That's why,'' Mr. Brandwen said, ''we all want this to work.''</p>
