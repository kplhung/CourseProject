        <p>Fifteen months after restoring democracy to Africa's most populous nation for the second time in 20 years, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria said today that he was ready to step into a larger role in mediating an end to his continent's debilitating wars, beginning with Congo.</p>
        <p>In an interview shortly after his arrival in New York for a gathering of world leaders, Mr. Obasanjo, whose troops the United States is now training for peacekeeping duties in Sierra Leone, said he recently volunteered to go to Congo and talk to President Laurent Kabila. Mr. Kabila has been the primary roadblock to efforts to end the war, which involves a half dozen African nations, and has been uncooperative with both the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.</p>

        <p>Fifteen months after restoring democracy to Africa's most populous nation for the second time in 20 years, President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria said today that he was ready to step into a larger role in mediating an end to his continent's debilitating wars, beginning with Congo.</p>
        <p>In an interview shortly after his arrival in New York for a gathering of world leaders, Mr. Obasanjo, whose troops the United States is now training for peacekeeping duties in Sierra Leone, said he recently volunteered to go to Congo and talk to President Laurent Kabila. Mr. Kabila has been the primary roadblock to efforts to end the war, which involves a half dozen African nations, and has been uncooperative with both the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo's offer was turned down by Secretary General Kofi Annan, he said. ''I wanted to go, and I told the secretary general, and I was told that it was not opportune yet for me to go,'' Mr. Obasanjo said.</p>
        <p>They agreed to send Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who during a short period as Nigeria's military ruler opened the way for the election last year of Mr. Obasanjo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo remains ready, he said. ''I will go,'' he said, adding that his message is simple. ''Mr. Kabila, your country needs peace. Nothing should be too much to sacrifice for peace.''</p>
        <p>As wars have further weakened countries in sub-Saharan Africa already devastated by economic problems and AIDS, Mr. Annan and other world leaders have tried to involve Africans more actively in peacemaking. Nelson Mandela, South Africa's former president, has negotiated a tentative peace agreement in Burundi. But tensions between South Africa and Congo have prevented him from playing a greater role there, where Rwanda, Uganda, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe all have forces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo, who said he had also been asked for advice by the military government of the Ivory Coast, acknowledged that Nigerians were waiting for a ''democracy dividend,'' but that this should not mean he had to look inward.</p>
        <p>Nigeria, he said, was not grabbing power, ''but if a situation comes to which we must react positively in the interest of our subregion, or in the interest of our continent or even in the interest of the world, we would be less than what we should be if we did not react.''</p>
        <p>Until now, Mr. Obasanjo, 65, has seemed reluctant to shoulder more continental responsibilities because he has his own priorities in Nigeria, now struggling to recover from another period of military rule that left the country isolated, deeply in debt and facing Christian-Muslim tensions. He seemed eager to withdraw troops from an earlier peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone. Shortly after taking office, he pressed for an agreement signed in Lome, Togo, last year ending the war. But flaws in that agreement led to a resurgence of fighting in May.</p>
        <p>''I said that Nigerian troops cannot remain forever in Sierra Leone, so we must work out some process by which Nigerian troops could start the process of disengaging,'' he said today. ''That was why we went for the Lome agreement.''</p>
        <p>''Of course we will always have domestic priorities,'' he said. ''But our domestic priorities must never prevent us from being a good neighbor.''</p>
        <p>Speaking as a general, he offered a prescription for Sierra Leone. ''We must be strong militarily, but we must not throw completely overboard what I call the political option,'' he said. But he ruled out any future political role for Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader of the Revolutionary United Front who resumed the war this year and captured 500 United Nations peacekeepers. ''Foday Sankoh is no longer an issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said he was also appealing to President Charles Taylor of Liberia, who has been complicit in Mr. Sankoh's rebellion and is accused of funneling diamonds from Sierra Leone through his country to raise money for arms. Speaking of ''doing what needs to be done as quickly as possible'' in Sierra Leone, he said, ''What needs to be done is disarmament, demobilization of everybody.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Obasanjo said speed was important in Congo also. ''We have to move quickly to get those troops that should not have been there out of the place,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said he thought that the nations involved, including Zimbabwe, which is propping up the Kabila government, could not continue spending money on this war. ''The cost of maintaining troops outside your own territory must be telling on Zimbabwe,'' he said. ''We know from experience what it is.''</p>
