        <p>Euronext, a company to be formed by merging the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam stock exchanges, has held exploratory talks with two French banks about raising money to bid for the London Stock Exchange, people close to the discussions said today.</p>
        <p>Euronext approached BNP Paribas and Societe Generale after last week's hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange by OM Gruppen, the Swedish company that runs the Stockholm exchange. OM's surprise offer postponed a shareholder vote that was to decide the fate of London's planned merger with Deutsche Borse of Germany and the Nasdaq stock market of the United States to form a Pan-European exchange called iX.</p>
        <p>The people familiar with Euronext cautioned that an outright bid for the London Stock Exchange was not imminent, as the company must first vote on its own merger on Sept. 22.</p>
        <p>''We have increased the number of banks we are talking to, to consider the present situation with the London Stock Exchange,'' said a person close to Euronext, who refused to be identified further.</p>
        <p>Another person described the discussions as a ''chess move'' -- just one in a series of steps that Euronext is taking until it unveils its full strategy sometime after the shareholder vote. The Paris bourse will own 60 percent of Euronext, the Amsterdam exchange will own 32 percent, and Brussels will hold 8 percent with plans to offer the shares later this year.</p>
        <p>A representative of the Paris bourse declined to comment on the situation, as did a spokesman for the London Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Euronext approached the London Stock Exchange about an alliance last May, but was rebuffed. The details of those discussions were never disclosed to shareholders. Euronext has repeatedly stated its interest in linking up with the London Stock Exchange.</p>
