        <p>Winfield Pierre was reaching deep into his iced drinks barrel for his bottle of F &amp; J Brandy yesterday. As he fished in the ice, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani ambled past him in the West Indian American Carnival Parade.</p>
        <p>After retrieving the bottle of amber liquor, he poured it into plastic cups or mixed it with Snapple, handing one to a customer who wobbled off from his barrel at the corner of Utica Avenue and Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''It's my personal stash,'' he said by way of explanation. ''Everybody drinks during this parade. It's a tradition. You can stop people from selling it, but you can't stop people from drinking it.'' Recalling the related all-night music competition held nearby, he added: ''Besides, everyone drank all last night at the steel drum festival. They were drunk when they got here.''</p>
        <p>Early last month, largely as a reaction to the sexual assaults at the end of the National Puerto Rican Day Parade on June 11, the city announced a ban on alcohol sales at all outdoor festivals, including parades. The change angered West Indian parade organizers, and their anger grew when the city backed off somewhat, saying the Feast of San Gennaro, a festival in Little Italy later this month, would be allowed to sell alcohol, although with a reduced number of vendors.</p>
        <p>Many of those at the West Indian parade clutched yellow fliers denouncing the mayor's appearance with the words: ''No to your racist alcohol ban! Why Eastern Parkway and not San Gennaro?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pierre, 42, who said he has sold beer on the parade route for several years, said he was making less money this year, now that his ice barrel, at least on the upper layers, was filled with nonalcoholic beverages.</p>
        <p>But he insisted that the anger displayed by many in the crowd, who greeted the mayor with boos and insults, was not exclusively tied to the city's decision to ban alcohol.</p>
        <p>''This ban was terrible,'' Mr. Pierre said. ''It wasn't right. But he gets booed like this every year.''</p>
        <p>Police officers at blue barricades two blocks from the parade route turned back anyone carrying alcoholic drinks. But the small bodegas off Eastern Parkway, the parade route, were packed with men and women buying bottles wrapped in brown paper bags.</p>
        <p>Most stayed in the stores, guzzling their purchases amid the newspapers and magazines, before heading back to the curb, where sound trucks were rolling past with Haitian and Caribbean pop music blasting away any competing noise.</p>
        <p>Isaac Quinerly, 59, a retired corrections officer, sat outside the Alomari Grocery Store on Utica Avenue drinking a bottle of beer that was wrapped in a blue towel.</p>
        <p>''We get one day a year to come out and enjoy ourselves and he does this,'' he said. ''Look at me, I have to hide in a corner to have a Heineken.''</p>
        <p>A cluster of men outside the store began talking at once about the mayor and the ban. Many said they considered it part of what they called the mayor's campaign against the poor.</p>
        <p>''We have got to get a mayor that can relate to us,'' said Mosi Oliver, 21, who was drinking a bottle of malt liquor. ''We have got to get a mayor who doesn't only relate to white people.''</p>
        <p>The mayor took his angry reception along the parade route in stride, smiling broadly, shaking hands among the vocal crowds and insisting that someday people would appreciate him. ''People are safer,'' he said. ''A couple of years from now, I'm going to walk along here and people are going to thank me.''</p>
        <p>But the ban did have its supporters, especially among the food vendors along the route who sold jerk chicken, curried goat and rice and beans from large tin trays. They said that there was less abusive behavior this year and that the alcohol ban was responsible.</p>
        <p>''The drinking makes people angry and impatient,'' said Bibi Gafoor, 40, who is from Guyana and was dishing up plates of food from under a blue tarpaulin. ''It is definitely a better atmosphere.''</p>
        <p>Yiagol Lodkin, 21, an Israeli student at the Lubavitch Yeshiva at 770 Eastern Parkway, handed out small cards with the words ''Long Live the Rebbe King Moshiach Forever'' to scantily dressed revelers. He was wearing a black hat, black suit and white shirt.</p>
        <p>''I know nothing of politics,'' he said. ''I did not know there was a ban.''</p>
        <p>But Emmanuel Koki, 35, from the Ivory Coast, who was handing out evangelical Christian tracts a few blocks away, saw the ban as a sign.</p>
        <p>''The body is a temple of the Holy Spirit,'' he said, wearing a white shirt with the words ''Revelation Soldiers'' across his chest. ''The mayor knows this. Now we have to go after the companies that make this stuff. This is a fight against Satan.''</p>
