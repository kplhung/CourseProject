        <p>THOUGH its brand is quintessentially American, its business, increasingly, is not.

        <p>THOUGH its brand is quintessentially American, its business, increasingly, is not. So McDonald's is turning these days to international promotional opportunities -- like the Summer Olympic Games, coming soon to a television set near you -- and to nearly everybody else's on the planet, too.</p>
        <p>''We estimate that 65 percent of the world's population will be watching the Olympics, at one time or another,'' said David Green, senior vice president and marketing officer for McDonald's International.</p>
        <p>To tap that enormous audience, McDonald's, which first began sponsoring the Olympics on a national level in 1976, signed on in 1997 as a so-called TOP Sponsor. (TOP stands for The Olympic Partnership program.) That gave the burger chain a global exclusive on advertising Olymplic tie-ins for its product category, as well as the right to a physical presence at the Games. The company ran its first exclusive ads and served its first official burgers in Nagano, Japan, at the 1998 Winter Games; this month's events in Sydney are the first Summer Games at which it will have the same rights.</p>
        <p>Restaurant operators in the United States and 97 of the 115 locations outside the country where McDonald's does business will take part in the campaign (most of the others, like Taiwan, do not participate in the Olympics). Certain symbols will be used by McDonald's everywhere -- the Olympic rings, for example -- and there will be some joint activities, like the agreement by restaurants in 19 countries to send workers to help their Australian counterparts flip burgers at the Olympic Village.  But each country has otherwise been encouraged to develop its own locally appropriate marketing campaign.</p>
        <p>That has resulted in different approaches. In Germany and Austria, for example, a promotion called ''5 weeks, 5 continents, 5 burgers'' begins this week. It features one differently flavored sandwich each week through the end of September, with each supposedly representing a different area of the world. (The McAmerica sandwich has ''two beef patties with cooked onions, two slices of cheese and barbecue sauce.'')</p>
        <p>In Asia, children's Happy Meals will include toy characters like Ronald McDonald playing Olympic sports. Australians will be given cards with meal purchases that can be redeemed for free food if Australia's team wins the event specified on the card. And local Olympic athletes will be featured on bags and on cups in France, where the company has had its share of public relations problems of late (antiglobalization activists vandalized an unfinished McDonald's there last year).</p>
        <p>In the United States, Happy Meals will offer ''Olympic-themed Barbie,'' Mr. Green said, and she will be ''trying out for different events, including one paralympic event,'' where the doll will be in a wheelchair. There will also be taste trials of newly flavored products. This week, McDonald's begins running a new ''Olympic smiles'' commercial, which plays off its new theme, ''We love to see you smile.''</p>
        <p>''It's all about bringing the fun of the Olympics right down to the customer,'' Mr. Green said.</p>
        <p>It is also about business, of course. McDonald's and other TOP sponsors like Coca-Cola, I.B.M., Visa and Xerox, are estimated to have paid $40 million apiece for their sponsorships of the 1998 Winter Games and now the Summer Games in Sydney. And that does not include the cost of the actual advertising to be done throughout the world, on televison, in print and otherwise, which surely will run to many, many millions more.</p>
        <p>''In most countries we are among the biggest national advertisers,'' Mr. Green said.</p>
        <p>Is it worth it? McDonald's apparently seems to think so; although I.B.M., for one, has dropped out of TOP, McDonald's has just signed on for the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics and the 2004 Athens Summer Games, at a reported cost of about $55 million. This even though it does not have a single new product on which to focus its worldwide advertising, which is often a justification for such costly, flashy ad buys.</p>
        <p>''It's a feel-good campaign,'' said Bob Goldin, executive vice president of Technomic, a food industry and restaurant research and consulting company based in Chicago. He puts the total, worldwide McDonald's sponsorship and ad expenditures at ''easily more than $100 million'' for the Sydney Olympics, a sum he called ''expensive and high risk.''</p>
        <p>''With a lot of companies vying for share of mind, McDonald's is banking on a lot of image to provide a sales boost,'' he said. ''And that can be tricky and hard to measure.''</p>
        <p>But will it work?</p>
        <p>Very possibly, according to Mr. Goldin. ''They know how to pull the heartstrings as well as anyone else,'' he said.</p>
