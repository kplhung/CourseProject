        <p>It was just after the rain delay, in between the exiting day crowd and the incoming night-session fans, when Hyung-Taik Lee's made-for-television adventure began to unfold in a studio setting of sorts.</p>
        <p>As bright lights flooded Arthur Ashe Stadium last night and cameras traced every move made by Lee, the miracle qualifier, against the ominous Pete Sampras, only a few extras to this surreal scene remained in their seats.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Lee knew an entire nation was fixated on his fourth-round match at the United States Open. Before sunrise in Seoul, South Korea, people were assembling in front of their television sets to watch their unlikely star on the country's first live broadcast of an Open.</p>
        <p>Under this crush of attention, Lee never gave in to stage fright. He was not in awe of Sampras or unnerved by the moment. And for one stirring set, the cellophane-thin Lee unabashedly whipped up passing shots that whistled in the air and dared to plop drop shots on big points. Lee went all out. Too much, in one case.</p>
        <p>On one freakish point in a tense first-set tie breaker, the flashbulb-quick Lee was racing toward the net to put away a desperate half-volley by his opponent but suffered brake failure. As Lee smashed, his foot brushed the net.  The violation cost him the point and a chance to put Sampras in a hole.</p>
        <p>And it was a puncture wound to Lee's spirits. Once the first set got away, and after the rain caused a two-hour delay, Lee's trip fantastic expired under Sampras's might by 7-6 (4), 6-2,  6-4. But as the 181st-ranked player on the tour, Lee felt good about what he had  gained from his experience.</p>
        <p>''Before, when I would play a ranked player, I would be more concerned with his ranking and I would be a little afraid,'' Lee said through his interpreter. ''I might consider myself a coward. But after this experience, I feel that I can play anyone on any given day.''</p>
        <p>He proved that during his run at the Open. Suddenly, the unknown found fame in the most out-of-the way places. On Sunday, he was ducking out of the rain, into a Korean-owned restaurant in Queens, when the sushi chef recognized him. Soon, Lee was giving autographs to all the patrons.</p>
        <p>Fame agreed with him. One day, he may be as well known as the other household names that decorated the marquees on Day 8 of the Open yesterday. Some stars fared better than others. Top-seeded Martina Hingis and second-seeded Lindsay Davenport had no trouble advancing to the quarterfinals. But after missing six weeks of play following Wimbledon with a sore shoulder, fourth-seeded Mary Pierce felt the pain surface again the moment she delivered her first serve against Anke Huber.</p>
        <p>Instead of blasting away with her typical catapult force, she could barely put a firm punch on her serve at all. Once she lost the first set, 6-4, Pierce, the French Open champion, retired with tendinitis in her right shoulder.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what I am thinking right now,'' said Huber, a friend of Pierce's. ''I am happy that I am in the quarterfinals, but I feel sorry for her. I saw her in the locker room. She didn't look very happy.''</p>
        <p>Pierce's mood was in stark contrast to the smile stretching across the face of Serena Williams like a banner after she escaped a scare from Jelena Dokic, 7-6 (7), 6-0. Last Wednesday, Dokic was in tears while witnessing a tirade by her father, Damir, who was banned for the rest of the tournament. Yesterday, Dokic was in position to push aside the defending champion.</p>
        <p>But on her second of three set points in the first-set tie breaker, Dokic was left with her hands on her hips in dismay when she whipped a backhand that appeared to nick the line for a winner only to see the linesman call it out. Dokic never recovered from the questionable call but exited under sympathetic applause. For the second Grand Slam event in a row, her father had spun out of control.</p>
        <p>''You've got to be able to deal with situations,'' said Dokic, who seems older than 17. ''I did that at Wimbledon, did it here. You've got to block things out.''</p>
        <p>Operating in his own isolation chamber, Lee seemed especially skilled at blocking out distractions. From the moment he stepped on the court, he showed the confidence of a ringer. He also had a few good-luck buddies on his side. One of Lee's coaches had given tickets to two men who had cheered Lee on at the Bronx Classic last month. After an all-night drive to make the event, Lee began his winning streak in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''When they come to matches, he always win,'' said his coach, Won-Hong Joo. ''It's good feeling.''</p>
        <p>As Lee's big match began, his newfound pals were holding up signs that read ''Positive-Lee'' and ''Absolute-Lee'' and ''Unquestionab-Lee.'' With those good vibes emanating from his corner, a relaxed Lee played without an ounce of inhibition. Even during the second-set rain delay, Lee was spotted in the players' lounge laughing with his coach and friends, and popping french fries for a snack. It was this kind of nothing-to-lose demeanor Sampras had to guard against.</p>
        <p>''It's always difficult playing someone you've never seen play,'' Sampras said. ''He came out playing well. He wasn't overwhelmed by the situation. He came out and held his own.''</p>
        <p>It took some time, but Sampras decoded the unknown. More aggressive by the set, Sampras sharpened his volleys and pounded out 14 aces to overwhelm Lee. If Lee had a chance, it was lost in that first-set tie breaker.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that I would have won the whole match,'' Lee said. ''But I would have had some momentum behind me, and I would have played much better. I wasn't myself at the beginning of the second set.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>The Australian 19-year-old LLEYTON HEWITT advanced to his first Grand Slam quarterfinal with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 victory over No. 7 THOMAS ENQVIST of Sweden, blasting 11 aces. . . . RICHARD KRAJICEK advanced to the quarterfinals after dismissing DOMINIK HRBATY, 7-6 (11), 6-4, 6-1. . . . ARNAUD CLEMENT also gained the quarterfinals, defeating ANDREI PAVEL, 3-6, 6-2, 6-1, 7-6 (5). . . . After his match was suspended because of rain Sunday night, TODD MARTIN resumed against his third-round opponent, the 10th-seeded CEDRIC PIOLINE, without difficulty yesterday. He was on the court 23 minutes, and finished off Pioline by 7-6 (5), 6-3, 6-2. . . . In another third-round match, eighth-seeded ALEX CORRETJA was defeated by CARLOS MOYA, 7-6 (4), 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.</p>
