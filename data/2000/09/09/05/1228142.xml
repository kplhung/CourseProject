        <p>Chronic Flight Delays Tied to Deregulation  Most experts now believe that delays in the nation's air traffic system, which have risen nearly 50 percent in the last five years, will get worse, not better. The Federal Aviation Administration, which runs the air traffic system, predicts that by 2010 the number of airline passengers will rise 59 percent, to 1 billion. About 70 percent of that increase will occur at the country's 28 largest airports.</p>
        <p>The story of how the nation's air travel system reached its current crisis can be traced back to one of the Government's most successful economic initiatives -- airline deregulation -- and to one of its longest and most expensive bureaucratic blunders: the F.A.A.'s ill-fated attempts to develop a new air traffic control system.

        <p>Israel to End Its Phone Monopoly  The Israeli government announced that it was ending the state telephone company's monopoly on domestic telephone and Internet service, taking a long-resisted deregulatory move that sets the stage for the company's sale to private investors later this year. Bezeq, the state-owned telephone company, will now face competition for the first time in Israel's domestic telephone and high-speed Internet market, just months before the government plans to divest its majority stake.

        <p>Internet Initiative Planned  I.B.M., Microsoft and Ariba, seeking to boost the rapid development of business-to-business electronic commerce, plan to announce a proposal tomorrow to create a vast set of online registries intended to help locate products and services and automate business transactions. Over 20 companies will initially endorse the proposal, and the backers said they eventually planned to turn the idea over to one of several Internet standards bodies in an effort to make it a broadly backed initiative.

        <p>Euronext Weighs London Bid  Euronext, a company to be formed from mergers of the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam bourses, has held exploratory talks with two French banks about raising funds to bid for the London Stock Exchange, people close to the discussions said. But the people familiar with Euronext cautioned that an outright bid for the London Stock Exchange was not imminent, as the company must first vote on its own merger Sept. 22. [C4.]</p>
