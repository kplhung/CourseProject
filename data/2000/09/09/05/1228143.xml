        <p>Aware that what they do in the next few weeks may help determine who controls the federal government next year, members of Congress return from recess this week for a final session compressed by the election campaigns and dominated by tax cuts, education, health care and government spending.</p>
        <p>The Republican majority's first step will be trying to override President Clinton's vetoes of its top tax priorities, repealing the marriage tax and the estate tax. But the efforts to override the two vetoes have little chance of success, Republican aides say. The votes, like much else that will happen this month, are meant mainly to provide fodder for the political campaigns.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have been pressing for concessions from the Republicans on two health care fronts: a bill to expand patients' rights in dealing with insurers and legislation to add payments for prescription drugs to the Medicare program for the elderly.</p>
        <p>Speaker J. Dennis Hastert is especially interested in trying to broker a deal on the long-stalled patients' bill of rights, and a one-vote shift in the Senate -- Senator Zell Miller, Democrat of Georgia, has been appointed to replace the late Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican -- could make the difference.</p>
        <p>On other issues, the Senate will almost surely pass a major bill that will establish permanent normal trade relations with China, even though Senate Republicans held back on this priority of the Clinton administration until just before the recess, trying to use it as leverage in negotiations with the White House over the broader legislative agenda. There is also broad support for overhauling the nation's bankruptcy laws to tighten the conditions under which people can seek debt relief. And Congress will also likely pass a $1 increase in the federal minimum wage, as Democrats have demanded.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to imagine we can do everything that needs to be done,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, ''but by and large there is some prospect for successful conclusion.''</p>
        <p>Battles between Congress and the White House over government spending have been a perennial September feature since the Republicans gained control of Capitol Hill in 1994. This year, however, lawmakers will be under pressure to reach early agreement with the president so they can campaign for re-election. Even so, few legislators said they believed they would meet the target date adjournment date of Oct. 6.</p>
        <p>Congress is likely to provide more money for education, but to support exactly what school programs remains unclear. Many other domestic spending bills are pending, and their final shape is in flux. It seems likely that, as in the past, President Clinton will force the Republican-led Congress to increase domestic spending over all as the cost of leaving town in time for down-to-the-wire campaigning in October.</p>
        <p>And in these final days of the session, every vote cast and every horse traded carries exceptional weight in what appears to be a close race.</p>
        <p>''This is the mother of all endgames, because the House, Senate and presidency are all at stake,'' said Mark Isakowitz, a Republican strategist.</p>
        <p>As lawmakers return from the recess that began before the national political conventions, they confront a new political calculus. When they left in July, George W. Bush was ahead in the presidential polls. Now Vice President Al Gore appears to have closed the gap.</p>
        <p>That suggests that control of Congress, especially the narrowly divided House, may depend not on the coattails of the presidential candidates, but more on what the lawmakers actually do, and how the public perceives their work, in the closing weeks of the session.</p>
        <p>Yet as they enter the session, Republicans have not shown a coordinated strategy on how to deal with the White House and Congressional Democrats.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Representative Tom DeLay, the Republican whip in the House, said he was ''surprised'' by an Aug. 28 letter sent by Mr. Hastert to Mr. Clinton proposing to work together over the next month to find ''common ground'' on increasing the minimum wage. While Mr. DeLay refrained from criticizing Mr. Hastert, his aides made it clear that he would not have sent such a letter.</p>
        <p>At the same time, with the end of the fiscal year approaching on Sept. 30, the Republicans do not appear to have settled on what approach to take with the White House in budget negotiations.</p>
        <p>On the big issues of social policy, meanwhile, Democratic leaders in Congress, the White House and the Gore campaign appear to be working in concert and framing a unified message. But some Republican Congress watchers said that the Bush campaign had tried to keep Congressional Republicans at arms length.</p>
        <p>''Clinton, Gore and Gephardt have message coordination, particularly on prescription drugs, Medicare and H.M.O. reform; Republicans don't,'' said Marshall Wittman, director of Congressional relations at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research institution. ''Bush is almost implicitly running against Republicans on Capitol Hill.''</p>
        <p>The heated debate between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore over prescription drug benefits reduces the chance that Congressional Republicans and Democrats will resolve their differences there. While the full House has passed a version providing subsidies to private insurers that cover some drug costs, the Senate Finance Committee has not voted on a bill.</p>
        <p>The Democrats have gained strength in the Senate and could try again to pass a patients' bill of rights like the one the House approved, but they would still need to rely on Republican votes that are not firm. Some compromise would probably be needed on how many people the bill covered and what rights aggrieved patients would have to sue their insurers.</p>
        <p>There is also a strong chance that Congress will restore some money it cut from the Medicare program, increasing payments to hospitals, nursing homes, doctors and other caretakers for the elderly. Senate Republicans, though, do not agree with the health care providers that there is a huge need for this step, and the size of any increase remains uncertain.</p>
        <p>The various policy differences and political jockeying will be on display from the start. On Thursday, the House leadership has scheduled a vote on overriding President Clinton's Aug. 31 veto of the bill to phase out federal inheritance taxes.</p>
        <p>Like the repeal of the marriage penalty which Mr. Clinton vetoed last week -- and which the House will try to override next week -- the president said the ending of the federal estate tax wa too costly and mainly benefited wealthy people. The White House said the federal government would lose $100 billion in revenue in the first 10 years and $750 billion more in the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>Because 65 Democrats voted in favor of abolishing the estate tax, Congressional Republicans initially expressed optimism that the House would strike down Mr. Clinton's veto and hand the president an embarrassing defeat. But it appears that some Democrats will reverse themselves, that some who missed the first vote will side with the president, and that the veto will be sustained.</p>
        <p>''We will try overrides on the tax bills; that will be unsuccessful,'' predicted a top aide to a Republican House leader. ''Then we'll pivot and say to Democrats and Clinton, You can't spend it either. Our alternative will be to pay down debt and protect Social Security.''</p>
        <p>But the aide added that House leaders had yet to reach an agreement on such a course of action. ''The big dogs have to sign off on it,'' the aide said.</p>
        <p>Congressional Republicans must also devise a strategy to deal with the White House on the 13 spending bills that must be enacted by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 to keep the government functioning.</p>
        <p>The House has passed 12 of the 13 bills and the Senate has approved 8. Two, a $288 billion measure for defense and a much smaller bill for military construction, have been signed into law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has threatened to veto eight of the spending bills, setting the stage for fights over issues such as providing money for school construction, hiring more teachers to reduce class size and setting aside more federal lands for wilderness areas.</p>
        <p>Republicans are seeking to paint the administration as the recalcitrant party, emphasizing that a mere $30 billion, out of a budget with more than $600 billion in discretionary spending, is what separates their bills from what the White House wants to spend. They even note that they are providing the amounts the president wants for his school construction and class reduction programs, though, unlike the administration version, the Republican bill gives local school districts an option of not spending the new federal aid for those purposes. But White House officials say the difference is less about amounts than how the money is to be spent.</p>
        <p>Republicans say that any problems reaching agreement with the administration will benefit them and their presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's going to work this time,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who is chairman of the Senate Republican campaign committee. ''It's going to help Governor Bush because he will demonstrate that he's the guy who can reach across party lines and govern. It will illustrate the Clinton-Gore administration's inability to govern on a bipartisan basis. Let them do it.''</p>
        <p>But Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, said that on social policy the standoff in Congress would help his party.</p>
        <p>''The fact of the matter is the American people support the Democratic caucus issues -- prescription drugs for seniors, a patients' bill of rights, education for our future -- and those are the issues that our Republicans are trying to bill themselves as champions of, but it's just not working,'' said Mr. Kennedy, who is chairman of the House Democratic campaign committee. ''The American people know it's the Democrats that are truly on their side.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 6, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about each party's legislative goals for Congress this fall misspelled the surname of an official at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research institution, who said he thought the Democrats were working more closely with their presidential candidate than were the Republicans with theirs. The official is Marshall Wittmann, not Wittman.</p>
