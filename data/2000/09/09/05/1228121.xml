        <p>England's Court of Appeal heard a request today to decide whether doctors can proceed with an operation separating joined twins that would sacrifice the life of one to save the other. The infants' parents have objected to the plan, even though doctors say both children will probably die if the surgery is not performed.</p>
        <p>In a case that raises conflicting moral, religious and ethical questions, the parents are seeking to overturn a decision by the High Court on Aug. 25 that gave surgeons the go-ahead to separate the girls. The appeals court is widely expected to make its decision on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Jodie and Mary, false names used by the High Court to preserve anonymity, were born on Aug. 8 in Manchester joined at the pelvis. Jodie is said to be bright and alert, but Mary is more passive and relies on Jodie for heart and lung functions and lives only because she is attached to her.</p>
        <p>Mr. Justice Johnson, giving the High Court opinion, reasoned, ''For Jodie, separation means the expectation of a normal life; for Mary it means death.''</p>
        <p>The Manchester medical team said there was an 80 to 90 percent chance that if the twins remained joined, both would die in three to six months as Jodie's heart fails under the burden of supporting more than just herself.</p>
        <p>The parents, both Roman Catholics from a European community identified only as ''remote,'' came here to have the children when they realized that they were joined and that their home country lacked of sophisticated medical centers. The parents were not in court. But their lawyer, Simon Taylor, submitted a statement from them that said:</p>
        <p>''We cannot begin to accept or contemplate that one of our children should die to enable the other one to survive. That is not God's will. Everyone has a right to life, so why should we kill one of our daughters to enable the other one to survive?''</p>
        <p>Citing a second principle arising out of their religious belief, Mr. Taylor told the three-judge appellate panel: ''They don't want either of their daughters to be actively killed. But they also say, 'We recognize the dire prognosis without separation, and we don't want to prolong matters by active treatment.' ''</p>
        <p>Judith Parker, assigned to be Jodie's lawyer, said there was no reason to believe that she would not have a normal life expectancy if separated, saying, ''We must look at it not that something is being done to Mary to hasten the end of her life, but that something is being done to Jodie in order to restore to her, her own integrity and bodily system.''</p>
        <p>But the parents argued that separation would not guarantee a good result for Jodie and that the isolated place where they lived could not provide the care that she might need. It would be ''arduous for her and arduous for the family,'' Mr. Taylor said.</p>
        <p>The case has sparked expressions of dismay and concern from religious, judicial and medical groups. But it has also provoked threats from more activist organizations.</p>
        <p>The judges agreed to a plea for official anonymity for a witness from the Manchester hospital after hearing that doctors were receiving hate mail. ''This is the sort of case where feelings run high,'' said Adrian Whitfield, representing the Central Manchester Healthcare Trust. ''Ethical positions can run to extremes.''</p>
        <p>Lord Justice Ward called today for a second medical opinion to obtain confirmation of what he called the ''wholly bleak prospect'' for Mary. A specialist from Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in London was assigned to see the twins and report back to the court on Tuesday.</p>
