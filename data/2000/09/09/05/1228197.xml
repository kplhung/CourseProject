        <p>Rains and heavy winds were partly responsible for the drowning death of a Bronx man yesterday afternoon, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, Jesse Parker, 57, was fishing with friends in Broad Channel near Far Rockaway in Queens when a storm created a strong current, the police said. Mr. Parker was sharing a boat with Natale Albanese, 72, of Inwood, on Long Island.</p>
        <p>The two men maneuvered the 15-foot motorboat under the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge, where they tried to steady the boat by holding on to the pilings. But Mr. Parker either lost his balance or the boat was swept out from under him, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Albanese threw Mr. Parker a line and extended his hand, but was unable to reach him. Witnesses called the police, and after the harbor unit arrived, divers recovered Mr. Parker from underwater, the police said. He was pronounced dead at Peninsula Hospital at 6:35 p.m. Mr. Albanese was also taken to Peninsula Hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries and released.</p>
        <p>Mr. Albanese's son Anthony, 14, said last night that his father is a retired locksmith and janitor who goes fishing every day. He said his father had not met Mr. Parker before yesterday. They were introduced by three friends who accompanied them in a second boat, Anthony said.</p>
