        <p>With the rate of Caesarean sections on the rise, a leading group of obstetricians has issued guidelines that may reduce the number of operations.</p>
        <p>This month, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that, for the third year in a row, surgically assisted deliveries were up, after a period of decline that began in 1989.</p>
        <p>Of the 3.9 million births in this country in 1999, 22 percent were Caesarean, the study found. That represented a 17 percent decline in vaginal deliveries.</p>
        <p>The study prompted a series of recommendations by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The group cautioned that simply comparing Caesarean rates from hospital to hospital was unwise, because some hospitals have a higher concentration of at-risk women more likely to require the procedure.</p>
        <p>But the group said there were steps hospitals could take to reduce the number of such operations. Among them: improved training for residents and postresidents in how to assist vaginal delivery with tools like forceps and vacuum devices.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the group said, hospital management decisions may affect the Caesarean rates. Increasing the presence of nurses and other employees who support women in labor can also increase the number of natural deliveries, the researchers said.</p>
