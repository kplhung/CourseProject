        <p>MARCEL PROUST  By Jean-Yves Tadie  Illustrated. Translated by Euan Cameron. 986 pages. Viking. $40.</p>
        <p>Marcel Proust never cared much for the art of biography. ''A book,'' he wrote, ''is the product of a different self from the one we manifest in our habits, our social life and our vices.'' In his own case, certainly, there was a ludicrous gap between his life and art. A sycophantic snob and posturing dandy, he frittered away his youth -- and his father's money -- trying to ingratiate himself with the idle rich; in his masterpiece, ''Remembrance of Things Past,'' he would transform those frivolous experiences into a luminous meditation on the nature of time and memory and loss.</p>
        <p>In his tedious new study of Proust, Jean-Yves Tadie -- the editor of the Pleiade edition of ''Remembrance of Things Past'' -- seems to share his  subject's suspicion of biography. He whines that the adult Proust never revealed his inner life in his correspondence, and makes the odd complaint that George Painter, the author of the best-known biography of the writer to date, succumbed ''without any qualms'' to the temptation ''to draw from the novel in order to explain, or understand, the life.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Tadie's own biography, it turns out to be quite devoid of any compelling insight into Proust's character or work. Mr. Tadie writes that he has tried ''to depict the individual in so far as he is a type: the child of a middle-class family, a pupil at the Lycee Condorcet, a student at the Ecole des Sciences Politiques, an asthmatic, a 'young poet' who wrote more letters than he received, a person who took the waters at seaside resorts.'' In doing so, he adds, he has tried to avoid ''the tedium of anecdotes that are too specific'' -- a decidedly bizarre approach for any biographer, never mind one writing the life of an author whose entire work was grounded in a specificity of social and psychological detail.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Tadie has done a persuasive job of explicating the intellectual influences on Proust's work -- from Balzac and Zola through Ruskin, Wagner and Carlyle -- he has failed in this volume to give the reader an appreciation of ''Remembrance of Things Past'' or the workings of the novelist's imagination. ''Marcel Proust,'' which has been clumsily translated from the French by Euan Cameron, lacks the eloquence and evocative power of Mr. Painter's two-volume biography (originally published in 1959 and 1965) and even pales next to William C. Carter's plodding biography (''Marcel Proust,'' Yale University Press), published earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The author's claim that ''nowhere in this lengthy book will you come across a single insignificant fact'' is credible only if you think of this volume as a kind of doctoral thesis on the step-by-step evolution of ''Remembrance of Things Past'' -- that is, a blow by blow by blow account of how the novel developed from one draft to another; how friends, acquaintances, trips and observations were gradually worked into the ever-expanding manuscript. Mr Tadie assumes that the reader not only is familiar with every aspect of the 3,000-page ''Remembrance of Things Past'' but also possesses a working knowledge of such earlier works as ''Jean Santeuil'' and ''Contre Sainte-Beuve.'' He does nothing to convey the power -- or weaknesses -- of Proust's books; nor does he illuminate the author's compulsive need to translate his experiences into words.</p>
        <p>As for his observations on Proust's emotional life, they tend to fall into two categories. Bland generalization: ''like all parents,'' Mr. Tadie observes, ''his own inspired in him love as well as hatred, imitation and opposition, inspiration and the will to destroy.'' And patronizing speculation: of the novelist's fear of rats, he writes, ''Had Proust been psychoanalyzed, which he never was, the psychoanalysts would no doubt furnish an explanation for it, linking it to anality and masochism.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to many earlier biographers who have emphasized the role that Proust's obsessive relationship with his mother played in shaping his sensibility, Mr. Tadie argues that it was his father, an eminent physician, who was ''present throughout his work.'' He notes that Proust adopted his father's medical outlook in defining love as an illness or disease and that many of his descriptions were couched in the language of symptoms and diagnoses.</p>
        <p>Most of Mr. Tadie's other observations will be highly familiar to readers of earlier biographies. Once again we hear about Proust's efforts to insinuate himself into high society. Once again we hear about his frustrating pursuit of young men, who withdrew from his suffocating need for control (the most notable, perhaps, being the mechanic Alfred Agostinelli, who became a primary inspiration for the character Albertine). And once again we hear about his asthmatic retreat into a cork-lined room from which he would emerge with increasing infrequency.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Painter, Mr. Tadie tries to show the real-life antecedents of characters in ''Remembrance of Things Past'' and trace the genesis of particular novelistic incidents. And like Ronald Hayman (the author of a succinct one-volume life of Proust that appeared in 1990) he emphasizes the role that World War I had on the shape of the novel: by forcing a delay in publication, it gave him time to expand and elaborate his story, to create the famously layered architectural edifice the book became.</p>
        <p>Mr. Painter and Mr. Hayman, however, said all this with considerably more style and acuity in their respective books. In contrast, Mr. Tadie's biography feels like a ponderous academic exercise -- an exercise designed not for the reader's edification or pleasure but to showcase the author's own erudition and prodigious capacity for research.</p>
