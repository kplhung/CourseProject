        <p>The National Grid Group, a British energy company, is expected to announce on Tuesday that it has agreed to acquire Niagara Mohawk Holdings, an upstate New York power concern, for about $3 billion in cash and stock, according to executives close to the deal.</p>
        <p>The move would catapult National Grid into a role as a major player in the energy market in the United States, where it has steadily been building a beachhead in the Northeast by making acquisitions. The deal would allow National Grid to leverage Niagara Mohawk's business with its other units -- New England Electric Systems and Eastern Utilities Association -- creating one of the largest power companies in the region and the ninth-largest power company in the country. Niagara Mohawk has 1.6 million electric customers and serves 540,000 gas customers. It also is a major employer in upstate New York, employing more than 7,500 people.</p>

        <p>The National Grid Group, a British energy company, is expected to announce on Tuesday that it has agreed to acquire Niagara Mohawk Holdings, an upstate New York power concern, for about $3 billion in cash and stock, according to executives close to the deal.</p>
        <p>The move would catapult National Grid into a role as a major player in the energy market in the United States, where it has steadily been building a beachhead in the Northeast by making acquisitions. The deal would allow National Grid to leverage Niagara Mohawk's business with its other units -- New England Electric Systems and Eastern Utilities Association -- creating one of the largest power companies in the region and the ninth-largest power company in the country. Niagara Mohawk has 1.6 million electric customers and serves 540,000 gas customers. It also is a major employer in upstate New York, employing more than 7,500 people.</p>
        <p>The transaction comes amid rampant consolidation in the energy sector, sparked by deregulation of the industry. In early August, the FPL Group merged with the Entergy Corporation, to become the largest electricity company in the country, serving 6.3 million customers. That megadeal was followed by FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU Inc. for $4.5 billion, just two weeks later.</p>
        <p>At $3 billion, National Grid is paying a premium of about 25 percent for Niagara Mohawk, which has a market capitalization of $2.4 billion. National Grid would also assume about $5 billion in debt, according to the executives. National Grid would make two-thirds of its payment in stock and the rest in cash, the executives added.</p>
        <p>Niagara Mohawk has become an attractive takeover target of late because of its underperforming stock price, which has stagnated the last 12 months, hovering around $14 a share despite a 23 percent rise in the Standard &amp; Poor's electricity index. Shares of Niagara Mohawk closed up 7.6 percent, to $13.88 on Friday, but still remain off their 12-month high of $16.19. United States markets were closed today for the Labor Day holiday.</p>
        <p>Shares of National Grid fell 2.8 percent today, to 557 pence, or $8.13, in London after The Wall Street Journal Europe reported that the two companies were in talks. Both companies declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Niagara Mohawk has been pushing to increase its share price through a massive restructuring program that included the sale of its hydroelectric and coal-fired power station last year for $860 million as well as a separate sale of its gas-fired plant in Albany to PSEG Power for $47.5 million. The company also announced a deal in June 1999 to sell its nuclear plants to AmerGen Energy, a joint venture of Pesco Energy and British Energy, for about $135 million.</p>
        <p>For National Grid, the acquisition would be a major milestone in its effort to gain a meaningful foothold in the United States, bringing its United States earnings even with the income it generates in Britain. The company has long sought to increase its presence in the United States, especially since margins in the energy business in Britain have recently been squeezed.</p>
        <p>According to the executives, Niagara Mohawk would retain its headquarters in Syracuse, and keep its name. No major layoffs are expected, though National Grid expects to achieve savings through natural attrition.</p>
