      <block class="full_text">
        <p>One of the country's media moguls, Boris Berezovsky, said today that a senior Kremlin official had ordered him to transfer his holdings in Russia's primary state-owned television channel to the state or face the prospect of going to jail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berezovsky made this assertion in a letter addressed to President Vladimir V. Putin that was made available to news organizations today.</p>
        <p>''If I agree to the ultimatum, television information will cease to exist in Russia and be replaced by television propaganda, controlled by your advisers,'' Mr. Berezovsky said.</p>
        <p>He added: ''By issuing this ultimatum to me, you have in essence put an important question before the country -- do nonstate media have the right to exist in Russia?''</p>
        <p>In the letter, Mr. Berezovsky did not give details about the nature of the legal threat he said he was facing, but said he was given two weeks to dispose of his 49 percent holding in the television channel.</p>
        <p>In response, he said, he had decided to transfer that holding ''to journalists and other representatives of the creative intelligentsia,'' for a form of ''public'' television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin is traveling to Japan and New York and did not comment on the letter, but a Kremlin aide did not deny that an ultimatum had been issued. The aide told the Interfax news agency that there would be no objection to Mr. Berezovsky transferring his shares to ''creative intelligentsia,'' but he expressed skepticism that Mr. Berezovsky would follow through. He pointed out that Mr. Berezovsky had used his television holdings as collateral to secure credit from one of Russia's largest banks. ''Maybe he is hoping that the intelligentsia will repay the debt for him,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>The publication of the letter was nonetheless significant because it underscored the unrelenting campaign by the Russian president to take large holdings away from the oligarchs who took them over under preferential conditions during the last decade, and wielded them on the Kremlin's behalf, but now have taken a more critical line toward Mr. Putin and his policies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin was said to have been incensed when, during the unsuccessful sea rescue of the nuclear submarine Kursk, the Berezovsky station, ORT, aired interviews with family members of the crew who were highly critical of the government's handling of the failed operation.</p>
        <p>In his two-hour session with Kursk family members, Mr. Putin vented his deep-seated anger at Russia's media barons, according to a transcript in the weekly magazine Vlast, published by Mr. Berezovsky.</p>
        <p>''They have embezzled enough, bought up the media and are now manipulating public opinion,'' Mr. Putin said of them.</p>
        <p>In June, Mr. Putin's government arrested Vladimir A. Gusinsky, another media baron, and held him at the notorious Butyrskaya Prison for four days on embezzlement charges that were dropped after Mr. Gusinsky met with Mr. Putin's chief of staff. Mr. Gusinsky then left the country and has not returnedleaving the fate of his media empire uncertain.</p>
        <p>The government gas monopoly, Gazprom, has forced Mr. Gusinsky to the negotiating table with threats to call in the loans that Gazprom extended him to develop his media empire around the flagship NTV channel and Echo Moscow, the radio pulse of the Russia capital.</p>
        <p>Dimitri Volkov, deputy editor of Vremya Novostei, said that the Kremlin' s feud with Mr. Gusinsky has been personal for quite a long time, but only since the Kursk disaster has the feud between the Kremlin and Berezovsky become personal.</p>
        <p>In the past, Mr. Berezovsky has not been known as a particular champion of a free or independent press. As custodian of Russia's first channel, he was better known as a clever propagandist.</p>
