        <p>THE RUNNING MATES</p>
        <p>POLKA AND KIELBASA -- Dick Cheney danced the polka with a Polish beauty queen, spoke a little Polish and dished out a few plates of kielbasa and stuffed cabbage in Chicago yesterday. Mr. Cheney, whose campaign style has sometimes been described as aloof in recent weeks, shed his motorcade and rode the El to the Taste of Polonia festival. At the festival, he greeted the crowd in Polish. ''Sto lat,'' Mr. Cheney said, or ''May you live 100 years.''  Then he spoke about his role as the secretary of defense under President George Bush. ''We were proud to work with all of you to help bring down the wall and free the peoples of Eastern Europe,'' he said, to applause.</p>

        <p>THE PRIMARIES</p>
        <p>JOCKEYING FOR A MAJORITY -- In the Nevada primary today, a former House member, John Ensign, is the favorite on the Republican side for the seat being vacated by Senator Richard H. Bryan, a Democrat, who is retiring. The Democratic candidate, Ed Bernstein, has no primary opposition. Three people are running in a Republican primary in the First District to take on Representative Shelley Berkley, a Democrat. In the Second District, Representative Jim Gibbons, a Republican, looks to have an easy re-election bid.</p>
        <p>In other Congressional primaries today, only one is closely contested. That is in Florida's Eighth District, where Representative Bill McCollum, a Republican, is leaving to seek the Senate seat being vacated by Connie Mack, a fellow Republican. Three Republicans -- Ric Keller, Bill Sublette and Bob Hering -- were doing last-minute campaigning yesterday. The winner will face the Democratic nominee, Linda Chapin, in a race that both parties say is a priority as Democrats try to gain the seven House seats they need for a majority.</p>
