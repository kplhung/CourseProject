        <p>Hail and Farewell  On the very day that Broadway bids au revoir to ''Cats,'' Broadway will be singing and dancing hello to a new season. With performances by stars like Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie of ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' Claudia Shear of ''Dirty Blonde,'' Rebecca Luker of ''The Music Man'' and Betty Buckley (in a reprise of ''Memory'' from ''Cats''), the occasion is ''Broadway on Broadway.'' The free outdoor concert, including numbers from long-running hits like ''Chicago'' and ''The Phantom of the Opera,'' also offers previews of songs from coming musicals like ''The Full Monty'' and ''The Rocky Horror Show.'' ''Broadway on Broadway'' is scheduled for noon to 2 p.m. on Sunday between 43rd and 44th Streets.</p>
        <p>Art of Instruction  Since its founding in 1875, the Art Students League has used as its model 19th-century-French art instruction, based in the atelier, or artist's studio. In this climate, students like Winslow Homer, Frederick Remington, Georgia O'Keeffe and Jackson Pollock have flourished. To celebrate its 125th anniversary, the league has planned a national sculpture contest, a gala silent auction and two exhibitions. The first, ''League Masters Now,'' devoted to some 75 works by current instructors, runs from today through Sept. 23 in the gallery of the school at 215 West 57th Street.</p>
        <p>Whistler's Way  Created at the dawn of modernism and regarded as precursors to nonrepresentational 20th-century art, the lithographs of James McNeill Whistler are at once abstracted, poetic and personal. Between 1878 and the late 1890's, as lithography gained acceptance as an artistic medium, Whistler worked with his printers to develop and expand the process. Beginning on Friday more than 80 works, representing his entire oeuvre in lithography, will go on view at the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas at Austin. ''The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler from the Collection of Steven Block'' will run concurrently through Oct. 22 with ''Whistler as an Etcher: His Work and His Followers.''</p>
        <p>International Affair  Shakespeare's ''Antony and Cleopatra'' will usher in the fall season of the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival when the curtain goes up at 8 tonight in the F. M. Kirby Shakespeare Theater on the Drew University campus in Madison. Directed by Bonnie J. Monte, this production, running through Sept. 30, stars Robert Cuccioli (Broadway's Jekyll and Hyde) as the Roman warrior and statesman, and Tamara Tunie as the alluring and powerful Egyptian queen. The festival's next attraction is ''The Merchant of Venice,'' from Oct. 24 to Nov. 19.</p>
