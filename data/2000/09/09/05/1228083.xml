        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The public advocate's report on the poor preparation that middle-school students get before entering high school (news article, Aug. 31) correctly identifies a problem, but his conclusion that educators are to blame is off target.</p>
        <p>The problem isn't poor education, it's the mayhem created by the students themselves that undermines the learning process.</p>
        <p>During the 1960's, educational ''experts'' conveyed to students the idea that teachers and professors should not act in lieu of parents. Unfortunately, they never offered a viable alternative, and bureaucrats and parents are unwilling or unable to deal with reality. Increased resources are part of the answer, but unless we make acculturation to civil society an essential part of the educational process, we are throwing our money and our children into an abyss.</p>
