        <p>New York City's 1.1 million public-school children return to class this week to face a worsening shortage of fully qualified teachers, even as tougher standards, including a newly required Regents mathematics exam, make the path toward graduation more arduous.</p>
        <p>Easing the shortage will be imperative for Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy, who is beginning his first full year at the helm and has promised to intensify recruiting efforts and on-the-job training for teachers. But even as city schools prepare to open their doors on Thursday, Mr. Levy is scrambling to meet a recent court order requiring that all new teachers in the 94 lowest-performing schools be certified.</p>
        <p>By Friday afternoon, the Board of Education had managed to fill most of the roughly 150 vacancies in failing elementary schools with teachers who were certified -- meaning they had passed two state exams and, in most cases, earned a master's degree. But the lowest-performing middle and high schools were still nowhere near filling at least 250 job openings, mostly in subjects like math and bilingual education.</p>
        <p>The court order made the late-summer hiring rush even more frenzied than usual, with many new teachers realizing at the last minute that they could get jobs only in failing schools. But last week, Mr. Levy calmly predicted that all remaining vacancies in the city's 1,100 schools would be filled promptly, and that the first few weeks of school would run smoothly.</p>
        <p>''I think we will be just fine,'' Mr. Levy said on Friday in an interview. ''This is not going to run with mathematical precision, but I don't have the sense that anything extraordinary is brewing.''</p>
        <p>Luckily for Mr. Levy, the school year is beginning without the political rancor that drove his predecessor, Rudy Crew, out of town last winter. The chancellor still appears to have strong support from the seven-member Board of Education, which appointed him in January over the protests of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Even Mr. Giuliani has softened his stance toward the new chancellor in recent months, meeting with him regularly and publicly praising his initiatives.</p>
        <p>In return, Mr. Levy has agreed to experiment with several mayoral education proposals, particularly a plan to turn some of the city's failing schools over to private hands.</p>
        <p>''The mayor is mellowing for a lot of reasons and it certainly appears that Levy has cemented a strong relationship with him,'' said Seymour Fliegel, president of the Center for Educational Innovation, a policy group. ''That's a critical step.''</p>
        <p>But many hurdles remain for Mr. Levy, a former corporate lawyer who is the first noneducator to serve as chancellor of the New York City school system in its 102-year history. For one thing, the city's contract with the union representing 78,000 teachers expires in November, and Mr. Levy wants their new contract to include stricter work rules and a swifter disciplinary process.</p>
        <p>In addition, he has promised to use his managerial expertise to overhaul the Board of Education's notoriously sprawling bureaucracy. On Friday, he said that he would begin announcing changes to the central board and the district superintendencies in the coming weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy would not reveal whether the changes would include layoffs or a juggling of administrative responsibilities. But Mr. Fliegel said that if Mr. Levy shrank the bureaucracy it could be the most significant -- and potentially the most contentious -- move of his tenure.</p>
        <p>''It's the biggest thing he is considering and it's probably going to cause him the greatest deal of opposition from within the ranks,'' Mr. Fliegel said. ''But if this reorganization were to happen, it would have a huge impact on changing the system.''</p>
        <p>When school opens on Thursday, there will be room for about 14,000 new seats in five new schools, new wings and leased classroom space. After two years of slow growth, enrollment is expected to rise more sharply this year, by about 16,000. But more than 10,000 of those children will be prekindergartners.</p>
        <p>The 1.1 million students returning to class this week include more than 20,000 who are being held back because they failed summer school or skipped it. Those students are supposed to get special attention this year to ensure they are not held back again, although specific plans remain to be seen.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most pressing issue for Mr. Levy is the shortage of certified teachers, especially in subjects like math, science and bilingual education. About 11,000 of the city's 78,000 teachers, or 14 percent, lacked certification last year, and most of them worked in poorly performing schools. Mr. Levy must work feverishly to shrink that percentage because a new state policy -- which he helped create in 1998 as a member of the State Board of Regents -- bans uncertified teachers from all public schools by 2003.</p>
        <p>The state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, sued Mr. Levy last month because the city was violating that policy, which also prohibited the hiring of uncertified teachers in the lowest-performing schools after September 1999. And the teachers' union has refused to bend its seniority rules and allow the chancellor to transfer veteran certified teachers into the less desirable schools.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of the uncertified teachers in the city's high schools are teaching math, a problem that Mr. Levy acknowledged was more alarming than ever given the new requirement that all high school seniors pass the Regents math exam to graduate.</p>
        <p>He said that he would try to expand the city's new alternative certification program significantly, with a focus on drawing people with math and science expertise. The program, approved by the Regents in July, trains new teachers in an intensive summer program, then pays for them to get a master's degree in education while they teach.</p>
        <p>The first teachers people to come in through the alternative route, a total of 332, are reporting to work in the city's 94 lowest-performing schools today. Known as New York City Teaching Fellows, many dropped other careers and took major pay cuts to join the program, which drew 3,300 applications from around the country. The program is a pet project for Mr. Levy, who has repeatedly said that ambitious, talented people from other fields could be an asset to the school system and bring fresh ideas.</p>
        <p>On Friday, he said the program had already proven successful because 96 percent of the teaching fellows passed the main certification exam that new teachers are required to take.</p>
        <p>''Now I see that this is an avenue for people of quality, I really want to ramp it up,'' Mr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy also said he would try to improve math instruction throughout the school system by improving math curriculums and ongoing training for math teachers. While reading scores jumped sharply in New York City this year, math scores improved only slightly, with 63 percent of elementary school students still failing to meet tougher new standards.</p>
        <p>''It's something I'm going to be turning my attention to and taking some action on within the next few weeks,'' Mr. Levy said.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the biggest change on the horizon is a plan to move thousands of students classified as disabled into regular classrooms over the next three to five years. The plan, which would require intensive training for hundreds of classroom teachers, would also significantly reduce the number of children who are classified as disabled in the first place.</p>
        <p>The program is not supposed to take effect until the 2001-2002 school year. But teachers are supposed to receive intensive training this year, in anticipation of the changes. In many cases, special education teachers will be team-teaching with regular teachers in regular classrooms.</p>
        <p>The United Federation of Teachers has expressed concerns about the plan -- in particular, how teachers will deal with students who have behavioral problems. Many of those children have traditionally been sent to special education classrooms. Randi Weingarten, president of the union, says teachers are also concerned that the training will be insufficient.</p>
        <p>''Most teachers I know have never done team-teaching and they're nervous,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''It's a challenge to do it in an effective way.''</p>
        <p>The union's five-year contract expires in November, and collective bargaining is scheduled to begin tomorrow, when Ms. Weingarten will submit the teachers' negotiating demands. Above all, the union is seeking a significant pay increase for city teachers, whose starting salary is now $31,910. Ms. Weingarten has also discussed the possibility of bonus pay for teachers who receive advanced certification or do extra work, like mentoring.</p>
        <p>But the union is vehemently opposed to a merit pay plan championed by Mayor Giuliani, which would raise the salaries of only those teachers whose students' performance improved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy has said that teachers need higher salaries, but he also wants to lengthen their work day, now 6 hours and 20 minutes. Although he has not proposed eliminating teacher tenure, he wants to make it easier for principals to classify teachers as incompetent and swiftly remove them.</p>
        <p>''I'm fixing those rules and look, I'm not coming back from the brink without them,'' Mr. Levy said last week. ''I don't know how I can be more blunt.''</p>
