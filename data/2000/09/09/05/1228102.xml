        <p>Preliminary data collected by Dr Henri Weimerskirch indicate that each wandering albatross, which breeds only once every two years, tends to fly in nonbreeding year to its own part of Southern Ocean, often thousands of miles from its nesting ground, and stay there until it is time to breed again; he hopes study will help in protecting birds, which have declined in all seven of their major breeding grounds over several decades; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The wandering albatross did not earn its name by just sitting around. The seabirds, the largest in the world, spend more than 90 percent of their life over the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere, and through banding and satellite tracking have been shown to cover tens of thousands of miles in a breeding season foraging for food.</p>
        <p>But wandering albatrosses breed only once every two years, and much less has been known about where they spend their nonbreeding, or ''sabbatical,'' year in the Southern Ocean, the great unbroken ring of water south of Africa, Australia and South America.</p>
        <p>Now, a French researcher has started to fill in some of the gaps in the wandering albatross's existence. The birds, he discovered, do not quite live up to their name: they do not wander aimlessly during their sabattical year. Rather, each tends to fly to its own part of the ocean, often thousands of miles from its nesting ground, and stays there until it is time to breed once again.</p>
        <p>''From band recovery, we knew a few things about where these birds were going,'' said the researcher, Henri Weimerskirch of the French Institute for Polar Research and Technology in Beauvoir, France. ''But we hadn't known what the birds were doing during the whole year.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Weimerskirch's work, reported in the journal Nature, is in the preliminary stages, with data from only a few albatrosses collected so far. But as more is learned about their travels, he said, more might be done to protect them.</p>
        <p>For these days, wandering albatrosses often do not return from their journeys; instead, they become the incidental victims of commercial fisheries, including those for bluefin tuna and Antarctic sea bass. The birds go after baited hooks on long lines as they are played out by the fishing boats, and are dragged underwater to their deaths as the lines sink.</p>
        <p>Mitigation measures, like weighting the lines so they sink more quickly, have been practiced in some fisheries over the past decade, but they have not been enough to protect the wandering albatross or others of the roughly 20 albatross species in both the northern and southern hemispheres.</p>
        <p>Wandering albatrosses have declined in all seven of their major breeding grounds over the past several decades, to the point where there are only about 15,000 pairs left (the birds mate for life).</p>
        <p>Rosemary Gales, a marine biologist with the Tasmanian Fish and Wildlife Service in Hobart, Australia, and an expert on the effect of long-lines fishing on seabirds, said that knowledge of where the birds spend their nonbreeding year could eventually lead to regulations that would close parts of the Southern Ocean to fishing at certain times of the year.</p>
        <p>''The ultimate goal would be to make the fishery ecologically inert, with no bycatch problem,'' using various mitigation techniques, Dr. Gales said.</p>
        <p>John Croxall, head of higher predator research with the British Antarctic Survey, said Dr. Weimerskirch's work was a good start. The goal would be to gather enough location data about the various endangered albatross species, and then to overlay it with information about fishing patterns. ''Then the options are to restrict location or timing or method of fishing, or some combination of all three,'' Dr. Croxall said.</p>
        <p>What has limited data collection in the past is the relatively large expense and, given the limitations of battery life, relative unreliability, of satellite tracking over long periods. Dr. Weimerskirch, with his colleague Rory P. Wilson, is the first to use a simpler, less power-gobbling technology, to log the birds' latitude and longitude. It is one that was previously used to track some marine creatures, and borrows a bit from a navigational method used by sea captains of old.</p>
        <p>A band around the bird's leg is fitted with a small battery-powered device, less than one inch square and weighing under an ounce, that includes a light sensor, a clock set to the starting location and a memory chip for storing data. The device records the time of dusk and dawn every day, and from that calculates day length, which can be used to determine latitude (the length of a given day varying with north-south location).</p>
        <p>By comparing the time of dusk and dawn to the time at the starting point, the device can also log longitude, just as sea explorers once tracked how far east or west they had traveled from the prime meridian at Greenwich, England, by carrying a clock set to Greenwich time and comparing it with the local time.</p>
        <p>While not as accurate as satellite tracking, the light-sensing device is precise enough to show the region of the Southern Ocean where the birds are spending their time. And, Dr. Weimerskirch said, his data so far shows that during their off-year, males and females go their separate ways. The females head north, toward more tropical latitudes, while the males go toward Antarctica.</p>
        <p>For both sexes, the activity level is far lower than during the breeding year, when the birds are constantly circling around their nesting region. In the sabbatical year, with no need to gather food for their families, they can ride the winds using their 10-foot wingspan and expend less energy. And they are molting as well, Dr. Weimerskirch noted, which makes flying difficult, adding more incentive to take things easy.</p>
        <p>Just why the birds prefer one spot over others is not known. But Dr. Weimerskirch speculated that they might be going to an area that they know has food and where there is less competition. Since the birds live  50 or 60 years, they have plenty of previous experience to rely on.</p>
