        <p>Declaring ''it's time to elect people who say what they mean,'' Gov. George W. Bush swept through two hotly contested states today and derided Vice President Al Gore for rejecting his proposal for three handpicked debates.</p>
        <p>As the presidential campaign entered the critical period that begins on Labor Day, Mr. Bush hammered away at Mr. Gore's honesty and credibility, tying him to some of the evasions of the Clinton years. Before a pompom- and placard-waving crowd in the Chicago suburbs, Mr. Bush recalled Mr. Gore's defense for making fund-raising calls from his White House office in 1996 -- that ''no controlling legal authority'' barred such activity.</p>
        <p>''It's time to get rid of all those words like 'no controlling legal authority,' '' Mr. Bush said, campaigning in shirt sleeves with his running mate, Dick Cheney, at his side. ''We need plain-spoken Americans in the White House.''</p>
        <p>A day after Mr. Bush rejected a schedule set up by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a bipartisan group that has sponsored debates since 1988, and put forth a plan of his own, he recounted how Mr. Gore had once said he would debate ''anytime, anywhere.''</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden, the words about 'anytime, anywhere' don't mean anything,'' Mr. Bush said, calling Mr. Gore's rejection of his debate proposal ''an interesting example of kind of the Washington doublespeak.'' Mr. Bush repeated, ''It's time to get some plain-spoken folks in Washington, D.C.''</p>
        <p>The throngs gathered in a schoolyard in Naperville, Ill., began chanting, ''No more Gore. No more Gore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush went on: ''When we tell you something, we mean it. When we say we're going to do something, we're going to do what we say. That's what America hungers for. America wants leadership that lifts its spirits.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore and his aides rejected Mr. Bush's proposal on Sunday, saying the Republican nominee was trying to limit viewers, instead of accepting the three 90-minute debates proposed by the commission, which would be broadcast by all three major television networks. Two of Mr. Bush's suggested hourlong appearances would be on talk shows that rival networks have said they would not broadcast. Mr. Bush did agree to one presidential debate sponsored by the commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's camp, of course, has a different view of the debate issue. Mr. Gore has frequently said he would debate anytime, anywhere, and his campaign has boasted that he has accepted more than 40 debate offers, without qualification.</p>
        <p>But on Air Force Two early today, Mr. Gore said he had accepted the debates only on the condition that Mr. Bush accept the three debates sponsored by the commission.</p>
        <p>''I said some time ago, the condition is we have to have the commission debates,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Later this morning on NBC's ''Today'' show,'' Matt Lauer, the co-host, said to Mr. Gore that he had not set such a condition in July when he accepted a debate offer from Tim Russert of ''Meet the Press,'' a program that Mr. Bush has also agreed to debate on.</p>
        <p>''Well,'' Mr. Gore replied, ''back in March I suggested we debate twice a week and get rid of all the TV commercials, but he's turned all that down. But here's the point, Matt. This is not about what is best for George W. Bush or what is best for Al Gore. It's about what's best for the American people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush started off the day with the rally at Naperville North High School. While waiting to speak, he leaned over to his running mate, Dick Cheney, and used an obscenity to describe a New York Times correspondent, Adam Clymer, who was in the crowd. Mr. Bush, his aides said, thought he was speaking privately. But his words were picked up by a television microphone, though they were barely audible to the crowd.  Asked later about the comment, Mr. Bush said, ''Well, I regret that a private comment I made to the vice-presidential candidate made it to the public airwaves.'' When asked if he wanted to apologize, Mr. Bush repeated that he was sorry the comment had been heard. Mr. Bush's director of communications, Karen P. Hughes, said of Mr. Clymer, ''There's been a series of articles that the governor has felt have been very unfair.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Lelyveld, the paper's executive editor, said: ''This is at least Adam's eighth campaign. He knows what he is doing. His work is both fair and accurate. The Times has never heard from the Bush campaign about Adam. If they have a complaint, they should convey it to us and we will review it as we do all serious complaints about our coverage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's campaign pounced on the incident to portray Mr. Bush as mean-spirited. A spokesman for Mr. Gore, Mark Fabiani, said that Mr. Bush had ''portrayed himself as a person who wants to change the tone and has broken his promise twice, with negative ads and by using an expletive in referring to a New York Times reporter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's rally in Naperville began a Labor Day swing through Illinois, Michigan and Pennsylvania, all states that President Clinton carried four years ago. Recent polls have shown Mr. Gore pulling ahead in all three.</p>
        <p>At the rally, a spirited crowd hoisted placards with slogans like ''Hunters for Bush.'' Mr. Bush then marched in a Labor Day parade led by fire trucks with sirens wailing.</p>
        <p>Later, he spoke at the peach festival here in Romeo. He kept the appearance brief, but once again needled Mr. Gore for refusing to debate ''anytime, anywhere.''</p>
        <p>''You see, that must all depend on what the definition of 'anytime,' is,'' Mr. Bush said, in an allusion to President Clinton's use of the word 'is' when questioned about his affair with a White House intern. ''Or maybe that depends on what the definition of 'anywhere' is.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday Mr. Bush plans to give out more details of a prescription drug plan while barnstorming across Pennsylvania. Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, said he was focusing on swing voters and noted that Romeo was in Macomb County, a Detroit suburb that is the original home of the so-called Reagan Democrats.</p>
        <p>Time and again today, Mr. Bush tied his Democratic rival to Washington and to big government, saying: ''My opponent and the folks up in Washington want to empower bureaucrats and make the health decisions for America. They want more power in Washington. They want the planners and deciders, the folks that are telling you how to think, in power.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also contrasted his and Mr. Gore's approaches to tax cutting and the federal surplus.</p>
        <p>''We understand the surplus is not the government's money,'' he said. ''The surplus is the people's money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has proposed a sweeping tax cut of $1.3 trillion across 10 years while Mr. Gore has called for tax cuts of less than half that and more spending on social programs like college education and home health care.</p>
        <p>To dramatize his points, Mr. Bush held up four dollar bills, and ticked off how he would use a projected federal surplus of $4 trillion over a decade. Just two weeks ago, Mr. Bush stumbled over his explanation as he made similar remarks. Today, too, he initially seemed uncertain.</p>
        <p>He said he would devote $2 trillion to Social Security, and he took away two dollars.</p>
        <p>Next he said he would allot $1 trillion to ''making sure that our defense is strong,'' even though he has called in the past for roughly $45 billion of the surplus to go to the military over a decade. But then after talking about defense for a few more sentences he caught himself and said that the $1 trillion covered both the military and domestic priorities like education and a Medicare prescription drug plan.</p>
        <p>And when Mr. Bush got to his tax cut, he handed one of the dollars to a man in the crowd.</p>
        <p>''I want one trillion, roughly a quarter of the surplus, to go back to the people that pay the bill,'' he said. ''I want the working families to put their money in their pockets.''</p>
