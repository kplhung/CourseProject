        <p>The best things about a marathon are the little events that keep people amused along the way.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore's 28-hour spurt over Labor Day across five cities provided several distractions, all of which contributed to the picture that the campaign wanted to present of a hard-working, energetic candidate on the move.</p>
        <p>It also afforded Mr. Gore an effortless way to show his human side. He reminisced with firefighters in Tampa, Fla., over mushroom omelets about an uncle who was a firefighter and used to take young Al to see the fire engines.</p>
        <p>''Everyone called him Uncle Punk, except me,'' Mr. Gore recalled. And he talked about the time his furnace exploded and he had to call the fire department, another everyman adventure that Mr. Gore enjoyed imparting.</p>
        <p>Many of the events involved food, and Mr. Gore seemed to eat at every stop.</p>
        <p>The vice president burst into song for hospital workers around midnight in Flint, Mich. He was interviewed by Edward G. Rendell, the former mayor of Philadelphia who is now a chairman of the Democratic Party, for a sports program, giving him a chance to praise the virtues of athletics, especially for girls.</p>
        <p>His staff sang its own lyrics to the tune of ''Route 66'' to mark the 66 days until Election Day.</p>
        <p>He was praised by a speaker at a parade in Pittsburgh for kissing his wife ''in front of millions of people'' at the Democratic National Convention. He responded to the roar of the crowd of 10,000, ''I like people who appreciate a proper kiss.''</p>
        <p>And as the hours grew wee, so did Mr. Gore's grip on his accent, which veered toward the homespun, as in: ''I'll be durned if we're going to go back to the old ways.''</p>
        <p>By hour 28, he had become a little punchy. ''I've got approximately 75,000 cousins in Kentucky,'' he blurted out here. He said his wife, Tipper, also had cousins here, and, mocking his habit of asking audiences how long each person has been married, he called out, ''How many people are related to Tipper?''</p>
        <p>Moments later, he derided the big drug companies, calling out, ''I've been at this for 30 straight hours -- you're going to get the unvarnished truth here, now, you know it!''</p>
        <p>The tour began in a downpour in Philadelphia on Sunday afternoon, with the traditional stop at Pat's King of Steaks for cheesesteaks.</p>
        <p>It ended tonight here at the Motor Speedway. In between, Mr. Gore, with Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, his running mate, at his side for part of the trip, hit Flint, Mich., Tampa, and Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Their message was one of alliance with working families -- and against the tax cut proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, whose name was rarely mentioned.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gore put it to about 1,000 people who showed up at the Tampa firehouse before dawn: ''If you give all that surplus away in the form of a giant tax cut mainly to the wealthy, you're going to have the top 1 percent get richer and richer, and maybe there's some benefit to that. We're not against people getting rich; everybody wants to be, I guess. But look at the public investment. How can we stand by if the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and the public investment in schools and hospitals and the environment and libraries all are falling into disrepair and decay? We need to start looking out after the middle-class families.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman paid homage in his own way to organized labor.</p>
        <p>''If the labor movement were a religion -- and in some ways it is -- Flint, Mich., would be a holy city,'' he proclaimed to a union-bolstered crowd that greeted them at the Flint airport.</p>
        <p>Later, at the Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Mr. Gore spoke sorrowfully of the recent death of Joe Abraham, the head of the local union of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.</p>
        <p>He was addressing health-care workers and telling them about the crowd at the airport. ''They said we wouldn't have a crowd close to midnight,'' he mused, then added: ''What's that song?'' Then he began singing, ''Close to Midnight. . . .''</p>
        <p>Throughout the tour, he found lines that garnered a good response, most especially a declaration to ''make most college tuition tax-deductible.'' He derided health maintenance organizations by saying they were controlled by ''bean counters behind the computer terminal.'' When he riled up the crowd, he asked them, ''Are you with me? Are you with me?''</p>
        <p>He and Mr. Lieberman staged a cozy scene for the cameras this morning at 4:20 a.m., after they landed in Tampa. They walked down the stairs of Air Force Two, picked up a newspaper that had been placed there, then walked back up to the plane, like a couple going back inside their house.</p>
        <p>The togetherness of the two has been striking over the last several days. They tend to wear similar outfits (khakis and sports shirts, then jeans and polo shirts), and Mr. Lieberman knows his place. He introduces Mr. Gore, they hug heartily, then he moves to the background and sits still, a reassuring presence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, who has criticized the Hollywood culture, spoke with some authority today in praising Tipper Gore for leading a push for warning labels on music. ''Long before it became fashionable, Tipper led the battle to protect our children from a lot of the violence and vulgarity in the popular culture,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore covered nicely for Mr. Lieberman on Air Force Two around 2 a.m., when Mr. Gore was chirpily telling groggy reporters about his many all-nighters (including two in a row in 1998 to write his father's eulogy).</p>
        <p>Where was Mr. Lieberman?</p>
        <p>''He's reflecting,'' Mr. Gore replied.</p>
        <p>The two made a brief appearance on NBC's ''Today Show,'' where the subject turned to Mr. Lieberman's repeated references to his faith. He was asked whether the emphasis on religion was the result of a political calculation that this worked to the ticket's advantage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman replied: ''I spoke what naturally came from my heart and I think reflects the feeling of the great majority of the American people. And the man I'm lucky enough to run with shares those points and said to me, 'Joe, be yourself because that's why I chose you to be my running mate.' And that's what I'm going to continue to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore agreed. ''I knew he was a man of faith when I picked him,'' he said. ''I believe in what he is saying, we share commitment to the separation of church and state, but what he is saying is right for this country.''</p>
        <p>''It's right for the American people,'' Mr. Gore said, ''and you bet we're going to keep on saying it.''</p>
