        <p>Politics can sometimes turn brother against brother.</p>
        <p>John D. Podesta, chief of staff at the White House, is trying to enhance President Clinton's legacy by adding prescription drug benefits to Medicare and by persuading Congress to enact a bill of rights for patients.</p>
        <p>His older brother, Anthony T. Podesta, represents the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, lobbying against the president's Medicare plan. In fact, Mr. Clinton complained the other day, ''the pharmaceutical industry has unleashed a shameless, scorched-earth campaign'' to block his plan.</p>
        <p>One of Tony Podesta's partners in his lobbying firm, which he calls podesta.com, Jeffrey Ricchetti, represents the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in the insurance industry's effort to kill patients' rights legislation. But John Podesta has his own ally in pushing the bill: his White House deputy, Steven J. Ricchetti, Jeff's older brother.</p>
        <p>''The Medicis controlled everything,'' Tony Podesta said in an interview, referring to the merchant family that ruled Renaissance Florence. ''We have it split into two families.''</p>
        <p>John and Tony Podesta are two of the most influential people in Washington, playing opposite sides of the fence that is supposed to separate policy making from special pleading. But their relationship -- brothers, former business partners, spokesmen for people who hold a large share of the power and money in America -- can be seen as emblematic of the way Washington works in the age of influence.</p>
        <p>Lobbying is serious business, but the best of the breed do not take it too seriously because they know that today's enemies may be allies on another issue tomorrow.</p>
        <p>John Podesta, 51, has served as staff secretary, scandal handler and chief of staff in the Clinton White House. He is needle-thin, intense, moody at times, but with a wicked sense of humor. He is an aficionado of roller coasters, working in a White House that often resembles one. Colleagues say, half-jesting, that he has an evil twin named Skippy, who is invoked to bring order to an unruly White House.</p>
        <p>When he was staff secretary, responsible for the flow of paper to the Oval Office, Mr. Podesta was particularly annoyed by intelligence bureaucrats who dressed up routine memorandums with ''top secret'' designations to get the president's attention. When the Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Council submitted a classified report that Mr. Podesta had already seen on CNN, he stamped it ''EMBARRASSING'' in big green letters before sending it to the president.</p>
        <p>Tony Podesta, 56, a big, barrel-chested man, is more flamboyant than his brother. He collects funky contemporary art and wears a tie only when he has to. Like his brother, he is full of kinetic energy. ''They're cranked up all the time,'' said their 82-year-old mother, Mary K. Podesta, who lives here.</p>
        <p>The company now known as podesta.com was founded by the Podesta brothers in 1988. For the first few years, the lobbyists were all Democrats, but since 1991, the company has become more bipartisan. Of the 30 professional employees, a third are now Republicans.</p>
        <p>The lobbyists include people who have worked for Democrats like Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut; for Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the House Democratic whip; and for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the United Mine Workers.</p>
        <p>But the lobbying corps at podesta.com also includes people who have worked for Republicans like Newt Gingrich, the former speaker; Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader; Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, the chairman of the House Republican Conference; and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.</p>
        <p>Another podesta.com associate is Heather Barbour, daughter of the former chairman of the Republican Party and adviser to Gov. George W. Bush, Haley Barbour.</p>
        <p>Tony Podesta insists he never calls his brother or Steve Ricchetti to obtain favors for clients, which include biotechnology companies and drug companies like Eli Lilly and Novartis, as well as Dow Chemical, Viacom, CBS, General Electric, Time Warner and the Motion Picture Association of America.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Podesta's clients say he has opened doors for them elsewhere in the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Tony Podesta is a facilitator, a broker, a translator, who helps businesses understand the ways of Washington. As a liberal Democrat, he intuitively understands how Clinton administration officials are thinking. Clients say they value his insights and use him to send messages to the White House and Democrats in Congress. Mr. Podesta said his company had billings of $8.5 million last year.</p>
        <p>Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a civil liberties group, said: ''Tony is a political operator, a political networker, with tremendous reach. There are many connections between the White House and his firm, that's clear. They know how to keep those lines separated, but it's a high-wire act.''</p>
        <p>Although clients or potential clients might hope that Tony Podesta offers entree to the White House, the Podestas say they never talk policy. It would be wrong ethically and suicidal politically, they say. ''He doesn't lobby me, I don't lobby him,'' John Podesta says.</p>
        <p>A longtime client called Tony Podesta not too long ago and asked him to contact his brother on a policy matter of concern to his employer, a big media company.</p>
        <p>''He said no,'' the client said, insisting he not be identified for fear of alienating one of the Podesta brothers. ''I said, 'Come on, call him.' He said no. I said, 'Tony, no one's been with you longer than me -- call him.' He said no; he just wouldn't do it.''</p>
        <p>Hilary B. Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America and a podesta.com client, said she had never known Tony Podesta to lean on his brother on behalf of a client. ''It would be stupid, and Tony's not stupid,'' she said.</p>
        <p>However, other lobbyists, competitors of Tony Podesta's company, said the relationship had helped generate business and had given Tony Podesta added clout.</p>
        <p>''Let's face it, when you're an assistant secretary of something and you have a bunch of phone calls after lunch and one has Podesta's name on it, that slip gets to the top of the stack pretty quick,'' said one competitor, a prominent Republican lobbyist. ''You know it does.''</p>
        <p>Steve Ricchetti, 43, has spun through the revolving door several times. He headed the political department of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association from 1987 to 1989 and led the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 1990 to 1992. He worked in the Clinton White House as the top Senate lobbyist from 1993 to 1996 and returned to the private sector to lobby for corporate clients before going back to the White House in September 1998. Steve Ricchetti's chief assignment in late 1998 was to keep Congressional Democrats from voting to impeach or convict the president. In January 1999, he became deputy chief of staff, with many additional responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Following in his brother's footsteps, Jeff Ricchetti worked at Blue Cross and Blue Shield, as director of Congressional relations from 1993 to 1996. The Ricchetti brothers, who grew up in Cleveland, created a lobbying firm here in 1998. They sold it to podesta.com early last year, after Steve went back to the White House.</p>
        <p>Jeff Ricchetti, 40, said he provided ''the full gamut of lobbying on behalf of Blue Cross and Blue Shield.'' As a senior strategist at podesta.com, he follows every twitch of activity on legislation to define patients' rights.</p>
        <p>William A. Pierce, a spokesman for Blue Cross and Blue Shield, said: ''In the patients' bill of rights debate, we do not support passage of any federal legislation. We oppose all the legislation in front of us.''</p>
        <p>Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, which provide managed health care for 53 million people, are particularly opposed to giving patients any new right to sue their health plans. Mr. Clinton says that right is essential. But Mr. Pierce said it would be ''bad for consumers because it would increase costs without solving the patients' problems.''</p>
        <p>Podesta.com boasts of its ability to build coalitions uniting Republicans and Democrats, corporations and consumer groups, and competing companies in the same industry.</p>
        <p>Tony Podesta has enhanced his lobbying power by raising money for politicians including Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>Tony Podesta refers to his fund-raising operation, built around fine meals at his northwest Washington home, as the ''Pesto PAC.'' His mother, Mary Podesta, cooks Italian food for guests at these political dinners. ''I'm the pesto lady,'' Mrs. Podesta said in an interview. ''The funny part is, I'm Greek.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 6, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about a Washington lobbying company, Podesta.com, in which two partners have brothers in high positions in the Clinton White House, referred incorrectly to Heather Barbour's connection with the company. She is no longer there, having left at the end of July for a job in California. And she is not a daughter (or other relative) of Haley Barbour, former chairman of the Republican Party.</p>
