        <p>If the Mets' punchless hitters need an example, they might want to look to Timoniel Perez. Perez, a 23-year-old outfielder, is in his first week in the major leagues and may not know what it means to press.</p>
        <p>''You can tell the new guys are free and easy,'' Tom Robson, the Mets' hitting coach, said today after watching his team flail away futilely again in a 6-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. ''They don't know about this. Perez is awesome. He's up there swinging. That's what we've got to do.''</p>

        <p>If the Mets' punchless hitters need an example, they might want to look to Timoniel Perez. Perez, a 23-year-old outfielder, is in his first week in the major leagues and may not know what it means to press.</p>
        <p>''You can tell the new guys are free and easy,'' Tom Robson, the Mets' hitting coach, said today after watching his team flail away futilely again in a 6-2 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. ''They don't know about this. Perez is awesome. He's up there swinging. That's what we've got to do.''</p>
        <p>Perez had two doubles and drove in a run at Cinergy Field and is 3 for 10 since his call-up. The rest of the Mets managed only four hits today as the journeyman Elmer Dessens mastered them. It was the Mets' fourth consecutive defeat, and they are batting .196 in their last nine games -- six of them losses.</p>
        <p>The Mets hold a four-game lead in the National League wild-card race, but they trail the Atlanta Braves by one game in the N.L. East. The Mets' position is still relatively comfortable, but if their slump continues, they will quickly be confronted with the notion that they have entered another September swoon.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine sees no evil and says no evil. A scuffling offense? Sure, he said, if that's what you call it when good pitchers make good pitches against you. Valentine chose to heap praise on Dessens, who has pitched two good games against the Mets. He allowed four hits and one run in six and two-third innings today.</p>
        <p>''It looks like he makes a relatively perfect pitch every time he pitches against us,'' Valentine said. ''He'd be a Cy Young winner if he pitched like that every game.''</p>
        <p>Robson saw something different. Taking nothing away from Dessens -- or Rick Ankiel, Darryl Kile, Wade Miller and the others who have subdued the Mets lately -- this slump is the Mets' doing.</p>
        <p>''It's us, it's not the pitcher,'' Robson said. ''We're just not centering the pitches the way we should, we're fouling them off when we should've hit them and then chasing bad pitches when we get two strikes. That's what we're doing, and all that leads to not very much.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' starters have a 4.18 earned run average, the best in the majors. When the Mets went 25-9 from late July to late August, they did so largely by winning close, low-scoring games and rewarding their starting pitchers with victories.</p>
        <p>For the moment, the pattern has changed, and the Mets are losing games like that. Al Leiter had a bad feeling when he gave up a two-run, first-inning home run to Ken Griffey Jr. today. ''Being down 2-zip in the first inning makes their pitcher a little more comfortable,'' he said, ''and if your lineup is already pressing, they're going to press a little bit more.''</p>
        <p>By the time Griffey struck, swatting an outside slider over the left-field fence for his 37th home run, the Mets had already missed one big chance. Perez led off the game with a double, but Dessens retired the next three Mets and Perez never left second.</p>
        <p>The Reds went ahead by 3-0 in the third when Dmitri Young drove a slider into right field with two outs, bringing in Pokey Reese, who had singled, stolen second and gone to third on a groundout.</p>
        <p>The Reds got their fourth run in the sixth inning, when the rookie Chris Sexton doubled, again off a first-pitch slider with two outs, again scoring a runner who had stolen second. ''That was dumb,'' Leiter said, noting that Dessens was on deck. ''I don't know what I was thinking.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had scored in the fifth when a sacrifice fly by Perez brought home Darryl Hamilton, who had doubled. After that, their offense continued to slumber.</p>
        <p>Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza drew walks to lead off the sixth. But Robin Ventura and Todd Zeile flied out and Jay Payton bounced to Dessens. In all, the Mets were 0 for 14 with runners on base.</p>
        <p>Ventura went 0 for 4, his average dropping below .230 for the first time since April 24. Zeile is also slumping, his average under .280 for the first time since May 12.</p>
        <p>With little production from their fifth and sixth hitters, the Mets leave Piazza scant protection. If Ventura and Zeile continue to slump, that weakness will be exposed in games against the Braves at the end of this month and, possibly, in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''The later you get into the season against certain teams, when teams get closer to you, they're not going to get beat by Mike,'' said Ventura, who says he feels fine and does not know why he is struggling. ''They're going to get beat -- if they get beat -- by the guys behind him.''</p>
        <p>To Piazza, who hit his 34th homer in the eighth, the memory of last September's swoon is ''ancient history.'' But there is no mistaking it, he said: the Mets' hitters are trying too hard, pressing. They need to get back to the basics, he said.</p>
        <p>''I think this club is resilient,'' Piazza said. ''We've worked hard to get to this point. We have to dig down deep and find a way to get it done.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Right fielder DEREK BELL, who had hoped to come back from his bruised left knee, knew something might be wrong when he could not run without pain on Sunday. He was examined by a doctor on Monday and learned he had developed cellulitis, an infection, in the knee. Bell, who has missed five games, will take antibiotics and wear a knee brace in hopes of returning soon. . . . Reliever JOHN FRANCO (sore left pectoral muscle) was available for the first time since Aug. 22.</p>
        <p>The Reds were 3 for 3 in stolen-base attempts against catcher MIKE PIAZZA, who has thrown out 16 of 116 runners trying to steal this season, a 13.8 success rate that is the lowest in the majors.</p>
        <p>The Mets promoted infielder JORGE VELANDIA and pitchers GRANT ROBERTS and BOBBY M. JONES from Class AAA Norfolk on Monday. Infielder-outfielder JOE McEWING, the final call-up, will join the team on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The offense is missing, and there are many culprits. Piazza: 2 runs batted in in 40 at-bats since Aug. 18; ROBIN VENTURA: 8 for 53 (.151), 2 R.B.I. since Aug. 17; TODD ZEILE: 7 for 48 (.146), 3 R.B.I., one extra-base hit since Aug. 17; DEREK BELL: 7 for 64 (.109), 4 R.B.I. since Aug. 7. . . . KEN GRIFFEY Jr.'s home run was only the third by a left-handed hitter off AL LEITER this season and the first since May 29. TONY GWYNN and SHAWN GREEN hit the others.</p>
