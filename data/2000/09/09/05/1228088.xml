        <p>Feeling sick to one's stomach may have more to do with the brain than the stomach. Researchers at Ohio State University say in a new study that they may have uncovered the reason that, often, people feel nauseated, even though what ails them has nothing to do with their digestive tracts.</p>
        <p>The culprit may be a brain chemical called tumor necrosis factor, or T.N.F., which the immune system releases at the first sign that the body is coming under attack. The factor acts on a part of the brain stem that regulates the digestive tract, including vomiting, said the study published in The American Journal of Physiology: Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology.</p>

        <p>''I think probably the mechanism evolved to protect us from eating fairly nasty things,'' said Dr. Richard C. Rogers, a neuroscientist at the university, who wrote the paper with his wife, Gerlinda Hermann, a research scientist.</p>
        <p>While that trait is useful for illnesses caused by poor food, it is unclear how, if at all, it affects people suffering from other ailments that commonly cause nausea, like chronic arthritis, AIDS and cancer.</p>
