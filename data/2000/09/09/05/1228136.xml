        <p>All the talk of faith and religion in the presidential campaign might be expected to gain the attention of a voter like Sarah Dotson, 28, who rose early this morning to attend Mass at Holy Ghost Roman Catholic Church here.</p>
        <p>She had noticed, all right. And that was the problem.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, it makes me a little uncomfortable,'' said Ms. Dotson, who clutched a prayer book as church bells pealed on this Sunday morning. ''I've heard enough from the candidates about how they pray. I want to hear how they're going to keep the economy going.''</p>
        <p>Voters could scarcely miss the expressions of religious faith by candidates in this presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican nominee, declared a ''Jesus Day'' in his state. Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee, has described himself as a born-again Christian who often asks himself, ''What would Jesus do?''</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, who is an Orthodox Jew, has urged that religious faith play a stronger role in American life.</p>
        <p>But for all the soul baring by candidates, more than three dozen voters interviewed around the country in the past few days expressed little interest in weighing the religious convictions of candidates in choosing the next president.</p>
        <p>As Kim Cart, a 29-year-old store clerk in Vinton, La., put it, with a chuckle, ''As long as he's not into Satanic rituals, I really don't care about a politician's religious beliefs.''</p>
        <p>Even those who consider themselves religious, like Dee Bobbitt, a 47-year-old waitress who teaches Sunday school and helps clean the First Assembly of God Church in suburban Houston, did not place much emphasis on the religious views of a candidate.</p>
        <p>''I care more if they're smart,'' said Mrs. Bobbitt, who thinks President Clinton ''has done a wonderful job,'' no matter that he might not agree with her views on the sinfulness of drinking, smoking, dancing and gambling, not to mention sex outside marriage. ''I'd like to say that it does matter if a president is religious, but it just doesn't.''</p>
        <p>Those interviewed also tended to express a skepticism about the sincerity of the religious views of candidates.</p>
        <p>Bob Doby, a 41-year-old truck driver from Stockton, Calif., shook his head with impatience at the religious ponderings of politicians.</p>
        <p>''It's just a way to try to get votes, that's all,'' said Mr. Doby, who added that he did not believe in God. ''I'm jealous of people who can go to church and find solace. I can't. Some people can, and that's cool. But it's got nothing whatsoever to do with running the country. It just doesn't have any relevance, and they ought to stop talking about it.''</p>
        <p>Shaunessy McNeely, a 21-year-old nursing student, who attended Riverside Baptist Church here, said she could not help noticing that politicians mostly like to preach to the choir and keep quiet if they think an audience is not receptive.</p>
        <p>''Jesus Day in Texas -- how hard is that?'' Ms. McNeely said laughing, adding that it was scarcely a profile in religious courage for Mr. Bush to issue such a proclamation in a state with so many evangelical Christians. ''Is he going to go to San Francisco, to Manhattan, and say, 'Rah, rah, Jesus.' If he does, then I'll be impressed.''</p>
        <p>David Carey, a 48-year-old Roman Catholic who works for an insurance company here, said he appreciated that candidates were trying to ''invoke a higher moral standard.'' But Mr. Carey said it was folly to try to assess which candidate seemed to be more religious.</p>
        <p>''When the candidates talk about religion, I just ignore them,'' he said. ''It says more about what the politicians think of the voters, and what they think the voters want to hear.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, a few voters said the candidates should be talking more about religion, not less.</p>
        <p>''The morals of the country are shot, and God is the only way to bring things back,'' said Bruce Abel, a 53-year-old kitchen designer, who was on his way to Riverside Baptist Church here. ''Belief in God has shaped this country from the founding, and God's hand needs to be in politics today.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Clinton had been more religious, Mr. Abel said, the nation would not have been forced to endure the sex scandal that nearly drove him from office.</p>
        <p>''But Clinton getting elected was all part of God's plan,'' he said. ''It was part of a lesson for us.''</p>
        <p>Some voters said it was healthy for candidates to talk about religion, as long as they did not push a particular faith.</p>
        <p>Merrill Goldberg, a 57-year-old math teacher from Shawnee Mission, Kan., said he thought it was odd that people seemed uncomfortable talking about religion but did not so much as shrug over the saturation of sex and violence in today's culture.</p>
        <p>''With all that garbage out there, I would hope it would be permissible to talk about God, too,'' Mr. Goldberg, an Orthodox Jew, said. ''To me, religion is equated with morality. So I don't have a problem with that. But it crosses the line when you promote a particular religion.''</p>
        <p>Among the candidates, Mr. Lieberman tended to be seen as the most sincere about his expressions of faith. ''He doesn't just say it,'' Ms. Cart said, ''he lives it.''</p>
        <p>Dick Rosenberg, a 61-year-old real estate investor here, who described himself as a nonpracticing Jew, said he also admired Mr. Lieberman. Nonetheless, Mr. Rosenberg said he wished the senator would stop talking so much about religion.</p>
        <p>''Religion shouldn't be used as a marketing tool,'' he said, supporting the call by the Anti-Defamation League for Mr. Lieberman to refrain from talking about his religion. ''It's a private deal, so keep it private.''</p>
        <p>Even among voters who said their religion shaped their voting, there was plenty of disagreement about the political will of God, judging from the disparate views among people who shared pews in the same church.</p>
        <p>Donna Loper, a 61-year-old secretary who attended Holy Ghost Church, said her convictions would prevent her from voting for a candidate who supported abortion.</p>
        <p>''It's against church teachings,'' Ms. Loper said; ''it can't be any clearer.'' She said she would be voting for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Michael Carrigan, 33, who also attended Holy Ghost, said his faith also shaped his ideology.</p>
        <p>''My religion inspires my politics,'' Mr. Carrigan said. ''The church calls us to social action and justice, to take care of the less fortunate.''</p>
        <p>He said he would be voting for Mr.  Gore.</p>
        <p>Few voters seemed more troubled by the religious talk than John Price, a 52-year-old management consultant, who was drinking coffee at an outdoor cafe here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Price, a former resident of Oklahoma, recalled a conservative politician in that state running on a campaign that focused on ''God, guns and gays.''</p>
        <p>He critcized Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore for making statements that ''smacked of the cult of Jesus,'' appeals that he said risked dividing the American public.</p>
        <p>''The only way religion is going to be an issue in the campaign for me,'' Mr. Price said, ''is if somebody tries to force it on me.''</p>
        <p>Then he checked his watch, put down his coffee, and announced he was in a hurry to leave.</p>
        <p>He was running late for church.</p>
