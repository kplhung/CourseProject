        <p>A consortium led by the global investment firm the Carlyle Group and J. P. Morgan has become the largest shareholder in South Korea's KorAm Bank after acquiring a 40 percent stake for 455.9 billion won ($412.6 million), the South Korean bank said. In a statement to the Korea Stock Exchange, KorAm Bank said it had signed an investment agreement to sell the stake to the consortium in the form of Global Depository Receipts. Earlier, a sole bid by Carlyle to acquire a stake in KorAm Bank was rejected by the South Korean government on the grounds that the investment firm was not a banking institution. Currently, the Samsung Group and Bank of America each hold a 16.8 percent stake in KorAm.</p>
