        <p>Clinton New York Trip To Seek Diplomatic Gains  President Clinton's foreign policy aides said he planned a diplomatic whirlwind in New York, including what one senior official called ''the last real chance'' to jump-start the failed talks between Israel and the Palestinians and what might prove to be a tense session with China's president over Beijing's continued missile exports to Pakistan.</p>

        <p>Siren Call of the New Economy  Policy experts say the State Department is losing talented diplomats who are leaving for careers that they believe have more power and prestige in the new global economy. The State Department is losing recruits to investment banks, dot-com companies and the Treasury and Commerce Departments.</p>

        <p>Debate on China Trade Deal  The United States Senate, after months of delay, opens debate this week on President Clinton's trade pact with China, setting the stage for a final showdown between free-trade supporters and their foes. Each side expressed optimism that it would prevail.</p>

        <p>Russian Mogul Cites Threat  Boris Berezovsky said a senior Kremlin official had ordered him to transfer his holdings in Russia's primary state-owned television channel to the state or face the prospect of going to jail. Mr. Berezovsky made the assertion in a letter to President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>

        <p>Court Weighs Fate of Twins  England's Court of Appeal was asked to decide whether doctors could proceed with an operation that would separate conjoined twins but would sacrifice the life of one to save the other.

        <p>Seeking a Peacemaking Role  President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria said in an interview in New York that he was ready to step into a larger role in mediating an end to his continent's debilitating wars, beginning with Congo. He said he recently volunteered to go to Congo to talk with President Laurent Kabila, who has blocked efforts to end the war.</p>

        <p>Violence in Sri Lanka  Fighting gripped Sri Lanka for a second day, leaving at least 344 people dead as the military mounted a major offensive ahead of crucial parliamentary polls, officials said. The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam launched two attacks against military positions in the northern peninsula of Jaffna but were repulsed, the officials said.</p>

        <p>Spurned Networks Express No Interest in Rival Debates  The ABC and CBS television networks, which were left out of Gov. George W. Bush's presidential debates proposal, said they had no intention of carrying debates sponsored by rival networks like NBC and CNN. The Bush proposal, announced on Sunday after negotiations with officials of six cable and broadcast networks, has thrown into turmoil the work of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the panel created in 1987 by Democrats and Republicans to avoid squabbling over debates. Since the creation of the panel, no candidate has gone so far to circumvent its work. The panel's executive director said she still hoped to negotiate an agreement under which Mr. Bush would consent to the commission's schedule.</p>

        <p>Mr. Bush derided Vice President Al Gore for rejecting his debate proposal during a Labor Day campaign swing through two hotly contested states, Illinois and Michigan.</p>
        <p>A22</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, accompanied part of the way by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, concluded a 28-hour campaign swing that included stops in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Kentucky.</p>
        <p>A22</p>
        <p>The Friends of the Earth, an environmental group that endorsed Bill Bradley in the Democratic primaries and considered supporting Ralph Nader in the general election, has decided to endorse Mr. Gore, officials of the group said.</p>

        <p>Congressional Priorities  Members of Congress return from recess this week for a final session compressed by the election campaigns and dominated by tax cuts, education, health care and government spending. The Republican majority's first step will be to try to override President Clinton's vetoes of the repeal of the marriage tax and the estate tax, but they are not expected to be successful.</p>

        <p>Judge's Doubts in Spy Case  The federal judge who tried to release the fired nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee from jail on $1 million bail said in a written opinion that he was no longer convinced that Dr. Lee had downloaded some of the country's most sensitive nuclear secrets. The judge had ordered Dr. Lee freed on bail on Friday, but an appeals court halted the release while it considered a government appeal.</p>

        <p>In Holiday Campaigning, One Walks and One Talks  Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick A. Lazio were miles apart, in geography and approach, for the traditional start of the general election campaign. Mrs. Clinton marched in the West Indian American Carnival Day Parade in Brooklyn but gave no speeches or news conferences. Mr. Lazio marched upstate, attended a fair and held two news conferences in which he contrasted himself with his Senate opponent on issues and qualifications.</p>

        <p>Teacher Shortage Persists  New York City's 1.1 million public school children return to class on Thursday to face a worsening shortage of qualified teachers, even as tougher standards make the path to graduation more arduous. Most of the 150 or so certified-teacher vacancies in failing elementary schools have been filled, but by Friday officials were still well short of filling 250 such openings at the lowest-performing middle and high schools, as required by a court order.</p>

        <p>Strike Looms in Philadelphia  The union representing 21,000 city teachers said it would ask members to authorize a strike in a vote today, citing a lack of progress in negotiations on several issues. The 200,000 children in the system are to return to class on Thursday.</p>

        <p>Debate on Cholesterol Drugs  New research indicates that even more people should be on cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, like young men with high cholesterol levels.
