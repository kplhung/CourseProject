        <p>Choosing two starkly different Labor Day celebrations at different edges of the state -- a volunteer firefighters' parade here in western New York and the West Indian parade in Brooklyn -- Rick A. Lazio and Hillary Rodham Clinton stepped off into their general election campaigns today.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton bopped down Brooklyn's Eastern Parkway while Mr. Lazio hammered her as an interloper trying to ride her name to power.</p>
        <p>The two candidates for the Senate could not have found two more disparate neighborhoods to mark what is traditionally viewed as the first day of the general election campaign. Mr. Lazio headed for this Republican dot of a town 20 miles outside Buffalo, stepping briskly down narrow streets lined with trees and single-family homes to waves of applause and shouts of support, as well as more than a few catcalls directed at Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the state, Mrs. Clinton marched through one of the most solidly Democratic parts of New York, Crown Heights, surrounded by a chaotic, throbbing throng of Secret Service agents, police officers, campaign aides and party supporters. She crisscrossed the street reaching for hands amid the cacophony of shouts of support and calypso music blaring from floats.</p>
        <p>For Mrs. Clinton, this was a day of pictures more than words. She seemed intent on enjoying what has proved to be one of the most intriguing spectacles in New York, the West Indian American Carnival Parade, which has become a mandatory stop for any Democratic candidate running in New York. ''It's great to be here,'' she shouted above a pounding soca beat, gyrating her shoulders and waist, though perhaps not as frenetically as the music called for.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton apparently did not hear the next question, about her thoughts on the Labor Day campaign kickoff, as she continued shuffling along down the street before turning off at Brooklyn Avenue and jumping into her van. She did not hold a news conference.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Lazio, traveling with a far lighter contingent of reporters, and finding a smaller crowd at the two events he attended -- the parade here and the State Fair in Syracuse this morning -- held two news conferences in which he reviewed his themes for the remaining nine weeks. He drew contrasts with his opponent on issues from tax cuts to health care, but spoke mostly about Mrs. Clinton, asserting that she lacked the grounding to fill the seat of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring.</p>
        <p>The first lady, Mr. Lazio said here, ''has no record, no commitment to the state, and has no real rationale for representing us in the state.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, on the grounds of the State Fair in Syracuse, Mr. Lazio said: ''People look at my opponent and they can't name one single thing that Mrs. Clinton has ever done for the people of the state of New York. And but for her name, I think a lot of New Yorkers wonder whether she would even be a candidate in New York.''</p>
        <p>The core issue, Mr. Lazio said, is ''about which person has been talking a lot of baloney and which person has been getting the job done.'' Mr. Lazio left no doubt that he put himself in the productive category.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton responded to Mr. Lazio's remarks through a spokeswoman, Cathie Levine. ''Congressman Lazio has been engaging in negative personal attacks because he can't improve his record and he has no idea how to improve the lives of New Yorkers,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's robust attack, coming after a month in which Mrs. Clinton has attacked him almost daily with speeches and television advertisements, emphasized the extent to which this campaign has turned negative. That is surprising, several analysts said, only because it happened  so early and so intensely, so much so that aides to both candidates are wondering what might be left to say at the end of October.</p>
        <p>Advisers to both candidates said that with the election so tight, and with so many voters apparently set in their ways, the only way to move an electorate already saturated with information was with tough attacks.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's march through Crown Heights today was a challenge for her security forces. Aides said Mrs. Clinton was determined to walk the parade as other politicians have, as opposed to riding in some sort of armored car, to avoid reinforcing impressions that she is aloof. At one point, a woman who tried to get near the first lady bit a Secret Service agent who blocked her way, leading to her arrest, the police said.</p>
        <p>Dressed in a lemon yellow pantsuit and wearing a yellow and green sticker that said ''Caribbean Americans for Hillary,'' Mrs. Clinton marched a good part of the route along Eastern Parkway with David N. Dinkins, the former mayor, at her side. She left the parade at Brooklyn Avenue because of a heavy downpour that sent many spectators racing to subway stations. As Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Dinkins marched, a campaign worker with a bullhorn worked the sidewalks, calling out ''Mayor Dinkins supports Hillary Clinton.''</p>
        <p>None of the scantily dressed dancers who are a fixture at the parade appeared in sight of Mrs. Clinton. As  she approached Kingston Avenue, she seemed impressed with the music. Just as the rain began to pour 25 minutes into her march, she began bouncing the umbrella an aide had handed her, shuffling her feet and finally swiveling her hips, to the delight of paradegoers.</p>
        <p>Many of the spectators seemed to appreciate her presence. ''She got my vote just being here with us and marching in our parade in the rain,'' said Clayton Whitgate, a Jamaican-American who said he had not thought much about the Senate race.</p>
        <p>In Syracuse this morning, Mr. Lazio attended to a bit of culinary business, eating a sausage sandwich after his initial demurral; he told a Syracuse reporter last week that he felt only ''so-so'' about the sandwiches, which are famous offerings at the fair. On Saturday, President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton made a point of eating one during their visit to the fair.</p>
        <p>''Almost like Mama used to make,'' Mr. Lazio said, more than once, as he endured the discomfort of eating a sloppy sandwich in the presence of television cameras. ''It's actually very good.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Lazio ate, the owner of the sausage stand, Paul Basilio, 76, stared and said he did not know how he would vote in this election. ''He's a good-looking kid,'' Mr. Basilio said. ''He looks like a little baby. How old is he?'' Mr. Lazio is 42.</p>
        <p>When the Clintons attended the fair on Saturday, tens of thousands of people turned out, waiting behind ropes in hopes of catching a glimpse of the president and first lady. By contrast, the fairgrounds were relatively deserted on this chill morning, and Mr. Lazio often went unrecognized as he made the way through the stands. He even smiled, if gamely, when a women asked him to autograph a clip of a newspaper article headlined, ''Clinton Whirlwind Vacation Gets the Vote Out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio then flew here, where he marched in a chill drizzle in the  Clarence Center Volunteer Fire Company Parade, taking his place in a long procession of firefighting equipment. This was Republican country, and there was barely a Clinton sign or supporter to be seen.</p>
        <p>''Give her hell," Charlie Rosenberg, a laborer from Akron, N.Y., shouted at Mr. Lazio. After the candidate passed, Mr. Rosenberg offered his view of the race: ''You can trust him. You can't trust her.''</p>
