        <p>Calypso's long tradition of genial protest found its latest target close to home during the annual Dimanche Gras concert on Sunday night on the grounds of the Brooklyn Museum of Art. It's hard to get more topical than commenting on something due the next morning on the same block.</p>
        <p>Each year a calypso showcase is the finale of a series of concerts presented by the West Indian American Day Carnival Association before the Labor Day carnival parade. This year New York City prohibited the sale of alcohol along the carnival's parade route, and the calypsonians -- most of them winners of calypso competitions around the Caribbean -- took turns mocking the new policy.</p>
        <p>The Mighty Sparrow, the most important figure in calypso since the 1950's, reached into his repertory for ''Drunk and Disorderly'' during his headlining set. David Rudder, who has reshaped and internationalized calypso since the 1980's, used his calypso prayer, ''High Mas,'' to cite Jesus' transformation of water into wine, then insisted, ''The mayor don't understand.'' Others on the bill, including Red Plastic Bag from Barbados and Pink Panther and Shirlane Hendrickson from Trinidad, also slipped comments about the ban into their sets.</p>
        <p>Of course they also had other things on their minds. King Smarty, from Antigua, sang about ''black rage on the rampage/black rage on the front page.'' Sugar Aloes, from Trinidad, sang a sympathetic portrait of a desperate, drug-addicted prostitute. Ms. Hendrickson bemoaned the absence of virtues like responsibility, leadership and integrity. And Lady Guymine, a grandmother from Guyana, teased about man trouble.</p>
        <p>The music stayed lighthearted, refusing to abandon the optimism that comes with calypso's lilting rhythm. The singers followed pointed social commentaries with flirtations and sexual boasts. Mr. Rudder's ''Calypso Music'' defines it as songs ''to make a politician cringe'' and also to ''turn a woman's belly to jelly.''</p>
        <p>Danceable protest songs show up across the African diaspora, which has never assumed that protests have to be prim. In Trinidad and Tobago, and across the English-speaking Caribbean, the main form has been calypso. Yet at least since the 1970's calypso has been challenged by both the sped-up, beat-heavy party tunes of soca (from soul-calypso) and by foreign styles, particularly reggae and hip-hop.</p>
        <p>The Mighty Sparrow, 65, is modern calypso incarnate, and he toys with the idea of being an elder statesman. He opened with a song about remembering ''for old time's sake,'' then refused to be in any way autumnal. Kicking up the soca beat of ''Drunk and Disorderly,'' he turned most of his set into a perpetually upbeat medley that mixed racy dance tunes and playful chronicles; it went all the way back to his 1956 song ''Jean and Dinah,'' about the fate of local girls after the closing of the American naval base on Trinidad. ''Not bad for an old man,'' he joked, rolling his hips.</p>
        <p>The other calypsonians didn't pretend to be unaffected by rival musical styles. Mr. Rudder uses the soca beat to rebound all over the Caribbean and the Americas; ''Calypso Music'' borrowed Thelonious Monk's ''Straight No Chaser'' as a keyboard line, while Mr. Rudder's new ''Wining in de Carnival'' was built on a salsa piano vamp. His set relied on his 1980's hits, but new and old, his songs were overflowing with melodies.</p>
        <p>Red Plastic Bag sang a calypso about trying, and failing, to understand the lyrics of dancehall reggae; then he switched to the uptempo soca beat for his recent carnival hit, ''Volcano.'' Lady Guymine shared a song with her grandson, Pablo G., that switched between calypso and the syncopated stomp of a dancehall beat, which drew shouts of pleasure from the crowd. He praised her as the ''nicest granny'' and a ''healthy granny''; she stripped down to a leotard, touched her toes and did a well-received bump and grind.</p>
