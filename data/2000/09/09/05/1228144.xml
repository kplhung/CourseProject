        <p>At 32, Mona Sutphen, smart, driven and possessed of that quality so elusive in Washington, an easy personality, was known as one of the best and the brightest in the West Wing of the White House.</p>
        <p>As executive assistant to the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, she was trusted to work on the most sensitive foreign policy matters. She sat through the tough crises, including whether to bomb Iraq and how to rescue an American pilot downed in enemy Yugoslav territory. Had she wanted, Ms. Sutphen, who was on loan from the State Department, could have gone to the heights of the United States Foreign Service: political counselor at an embassy, assistant secretary of state or an ambassador. Perhaps even the top job one day.</p>
        <p>But those peaks did not look so great to Ms. Sutphen.</p>
        <p>Instead of returning to the State Department and a future of writing cables that she felt nobody important read, she took her passion for foreign affairs to an Internet company. She is a prime example of what policy experts say is a crippling problem at the State Department: talented diplomats are leaving for careers that they believe have more power and prestige in the new global economy. And college graduates who used to rush to take the Foreign Service exam no longer bother.</p>
        <p>The State Department, the institution responsible for American diplomacy around the world, is finding it hard to adjust to an era in which financial markets pack more punch than a Washington-Moscow summit meeting. It is losing recruits to investment banks, dot-com companies and the Treasury and Commerce Departments, which have magnified their foreign policy roles. Some are turning to idealistic private organizations that work in risky environments abroad, a far cry from the days of the cold war, when the State Department was the only place to be.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Sutphen prepared to leave the State Department this spring, the Foreign Service made her decision easier because, while it took great pride in her as a woman of African-American heritage, it offered her nothing that she found challenging.</p>
        <p>''In the end there was nothing on the horizon that I really wanted,'' she said. After the hothouse of the National Security Council at the White House, and having served in Bosnia and Thailand, the ''idea of being the third political officer on the Israeli desk is very difficult.'' Instead, she chose to join the Manhattan office of Currenex, a Silicon Valley Internet company that specializes in business-to-business foreign currency trading at a salary of more than $100,000 -- more than twice her government pay -- plus stock options.</p>
        <p>The loss of prestige and power at the State Department has not gone unnoticed around Washington or inside the department itself. What to do about it has consumed study groups and consultants and caused  hand-wringing among the top echelon of State Department officials.</p>
        <p>In fact, the department was so worried about the problem that two years ago it commissioned a study from a consulting firm, McKinsey &amp;  Company. The results delivered to the department, with recommendations to be carried out this year, were not flattering.</p>
        <p>Young diplomats told the consultants that they were frustrated by slow promotions of the bureaucracy compared with promotions based on merit in the private sector. They questioned the relevance of their work. ''The best for what work?'' parried one respondent.</p>
        <p>They were dismissive of what they described as demoralized management. They complained that the department was unresponsive to the needs of two-career couples, especially when sending diplomats abroad.</p>
        <p>The study, titled ''The War for Talent'' -- tellingly renamed ''The War Against Talent'' in the department's corridors -- quoted one diplomat as saying, ''You've joined the supposedly elite Foreign Service and you have terrible managers -- people who've been promoted to get them out of other people's hair.''</p>
        <p>Outside the department, the United States Commission on National Security/21st Century, set up by the federal government to study the nation's needs for its national security architecture, has taken a particular interest in the State Department's failings. The commission's executive director, Gen. Charles G. Boyd, said he had been taken aback by the department's difficulty in ''retaining and recruiting quality people.''</p>
        <p>At elite graduate schools specializing in international relations, deans say that the Foreign Service has slipped down the totem pole as a career choice.</p>
        <p>Instead, smart graduates who want to join government are heading for the Departments of the Treasury or Commerce, said Mark L. von Hagen, director of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University. Others gravitate toward nongovernmental organizations and to the World Bank. ''It reflects the generally diminished role of the State Department in foreign policy,'' Mr. von Hagen said.</p>
        <p>The new director general of the Foreign Service at the State Department, Marc Grossman, in essence the department's chief personnel officer, acknowledged the problem when he appeared before the Commission on National Security recently.</p>
        <p>The dropout rate for one of the five groups of diplomats who entered the State Department in 1992 or 1993 was 32 percent, he said. For another group in that period, the dropout rate was 23 percent, although it was only 12 percent for two other groups. From 1994 to 1997, the dropout rate has hovered around 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Officials at the State Department's personnel department said they do not have statistics to compare this dropout rate with previous decades. Nor, they said, had the department done analysis to determine whether those who had left in the 1990's were considered the most talented.</p>
        <p>One of the most senior officials at the State Department, Under Secretary of States Thomas R. Pickering, who has served for nearly 40 years and has been ambassador to eight countries, said he did not believe that the dropout rates differed ''so wildly'' from the past, particularly in the era of the Vietnam war when many dissenters quit.</p>
        <p>But General Boyd said that anecdotal evidence suggested that good young diplomats had quit in the 1990's and that the dropout rate was higher than in the past. And for all those who are leaving, there are believed to be many who are more than qualified but are not considering the Foreign Service. Last year, said the under secretary for management, Bonnie R. Cohen, there was a ''significant'' drop in the number of candidates who, after passing the written and oral exams of the Foreign Service and the security checks, accepted an offer to join the department.  ''That means young people are looking elsewhere for other jobs,'' said Ms. Cohen, who is in charge of budgetary and personnel matters for the department.</p>
        <p>Money -- in particular the large financial packages from merchant banks that also offer stimulating work in the global economy -- is proving an important, though not overriding, reason for officials to leave. The average starting salary for a new Foreign Service officer is $32,500, Ms. Cohen said. This is less than some unionized customer service agents make at the Verizon telephone company..</p>
        <p>Peter E. Bass, 37 -- who after a meteoric career left the State Department this summer to join Goldman Sachs as the chief of staff for the bank's president and chief operating officer, John L. Thornton -- is one of half a dozen officials who have been enticed away in the last several years by Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>''I hope to gain a knowledge of the financial world, the global economy and capital markets, which are the key for global prosperity,'' Mr. Bass said, explaining his decision to leave. He had been deputy assistant secretary of state for energy and sanctions, involved in policy toward Iran and Libya.</p>
        <p>But the Wall Street scale salary was also a lure. ''When the difference in money is arithmetic, it's bearable; when it's geometric, it becomes harder and harder,'' Mr. Bass said.</p>
        <p>One reason that Mr. Grossman is appreciated as the new face of personnel, though, is that he acknowledges that money is not the only reason for losing good people. He knows, he said, that in order to attract and keep talent, the department must evolve.</p>
        <p>''The department has to change from being one that went and observed to one that sees itself in a more active world,'' Mr. Grossman said. ''I can't give more people more money but I can give jobs that are seen as more active and less passive.''</p>
        <p>But it may be a hard argument to win. Many of the fields that Mr. Grossman talks about being new to the State Department -- international trafficking in people, the environment, empowering poor women -- are often handled by other American  agencies operating abroad.</p>
        <p>The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for example, now operate at a number of American embassies. Rather than being proud of this expansion, American diplomats view these agencies as competitors for whom, they say, embassies perform the role of ''concierge.'' At the American Embassy in London, for example, fewer than 20 percent of the officials belong to the State Department.</p>
        <p>There are other hurdles: most notably, the archaic way the State Department hires people and treats them once they get inside. It can take up to two years before a candidate, who has taken the written exam (general knowledge, focusing on international affairs) and the oral exam (problem-solving) and passed the security clearance is invited to join the Foreign Service.</p>
        <p>Diplomats who have recently left the State Department argue that the substance of the work must also change if good people are going to stay.</p>
        <p>''You've got a culture where you are told to make notes and send them forward,'' said Spence Spencer, 38, who quit this summer after 12 years and three tours abroad. ''A lot of it is staffing to make sure your boss looks good.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spencer, who celebrated his departure over several glasses of wine at a recent lunch, left on a high note. He reached a cherished goal: equipping 30 court buildings in Kosovo with computers, fax machines, photo copiers, typewriters, generators and metal detectors.</p>
        <p>An official in the department's Human Rights Bureau, Mr. Spencer said there was much more in the field of human rights that he would like to do at the State Department but felt he would be unable to achieve.</p>
        <p>''There is such disdain for the community of nongovernment organizations at the State Department,'' said Mr. Spencer, whose passion is elections, police, justice and the other ''soft'' issues that crop up in regions of conflict.</p>
        <p>''At State, you can't talk to these organizations with ease,'' he said. ''So you are left talking to each other.'' Mr. Spencer is joining Public Strategies Inc., a company based in  Austin, Tex. He will specialize in public affairs for European companies exporting to the United States and plans to do pro bono work for international nongovernmental organizations.</p>
        <p>Another diplomat, Cynthia R. Bunton, 46, who dreamed of joining the State Department from age 12, speaks four languages and has served in a number of posts abroad. Now that she is back in Washington, the department is unable to find a way to use her new expertise in intellectual property rights, an increasingly vital issue for American business.</p>
        <p>As the consul in Naples, Italy, for political and commercial affairs, she became an expert in property rights and for the past year has been on loan to the Recording Industry Association of America in Washington.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bunton said she realized the importance of economics in diplomacy several years ago and decided to concentrate on music piracy. ''The question is: do I go backward and become a political officer again --  which I have been all my life -- or go out into private industry?'' she said. She still feels loyalty to the State Department, but she is leaning, she said, toward leaving.</p>
        <p>One of those on the United States Commission on National Security, Leslie H. Gelb, said that in order to keep people like Ms. Sutphen, Mr. Bass, Mr. Spencer and Ms. Bunton, the State Department must make  fundamental changes to regain the prestige of the past.</p>
        <p>''The State Department will be able to attract anyone it wants when once again the building becomes the center of making foreign policy and foreign policy strategy,'' said Mr. Gelb, who is the president of the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
        <p>''Good people want to work at places that are at the center of things.''</p>
