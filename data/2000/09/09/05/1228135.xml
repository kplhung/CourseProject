        <p>The five permanent Security Council members plan to use their collective influence this week and call for a revision of how peacekeeping costs are divided among member nations, a move that would -- at least on paper -- help Washington in its battle to reduce American assessments.</p>
        <p>The review of peacekeeping bills, which has to be conducted through a committee of member nations, would be intended to help put the faltering and cash-strapped peacekeeping department on a firmer financial footing.</p>
        <p>The five members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- will meet on Thursday as part of a separate Security Council ''summit within a summit'' meeting of more than 150 government leaders. Both the full 15-member council and its core of permanent members will issue declarations for the day.</p>
        <p>The permanent members' final draft calls for adjusting the payment scale for peacekeeping costs ''in light of changed circumstances.'' The scale was established in 1973 to cover an operation in Sinai and has never been revised.</p>
        <p>At that time, the permanent members, who hold veto power, were asked to pay a premium for peacekeeping on top of their fair share of costs based on their national economies. Other industrial nations paid just their share. Smaller or poorer nations paid as little as 10 or 20 percent of what they would usually be charged. A complex formula of special discounts claimed by many nations further skewed the system.</p>
        <p>Based on 1973 economic figures, the United States was assessed more than 30 percent and China less than 1 percent, a gap that has rankled American officials in recent years. Russia is still assessed as if it were the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>China has generally acknowledged that the system is out of date and unfair, given the changes in the economic fortunes of many nations. Saudi Arabia and Singapore, for example, pay minimal amounts. But Chinese officials have refused to agree to a significant increase in their bill.</p>
        <p>Diplomats say with the economy of Hong Kong now calculated in with that of the rest of China, Beijing will no longer be able to make a case for poverty, even taking into account its large population.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Congress has already ruled that the United States will pay no more than 25 percent of its bill -- when it pays at all. That contributes to an ever-widening American debt, because member nations do not recognize moves like this from individual countries.</p>
        <p>Reopening formal debate on a new payment scale will take a long time, diplomats said, because 189 countries will all have opinions to offer and limits to negotiate. But lobbying by the permanent council members will help the process.</p>
        <p>In general, the permanent five will recommend in their statement this week that the financial base of the United Nations, both the regular budget, which is assessed separately, and peacekeeping ''must accurately reflect the capabilities and responsibilities of every member state.''</p>
