        <p>Real men don't get colds.</p>
        <p>Or they should be less susceptible to them, anyway, because a new study finds that tough guys seem to have tougher immune systems, the body's natural defense for fighting off infections, viruses and the like.</p>
        <p>Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and the University of Nebraska have found that moderately aggressive men had higher levels of two types of lymphocytes that help control the immune response.</p>
        <p>The findings, published in a recent issue of Psychosomatic Medicine, were based on a study of 4,415 men ages 30 to 48.</p>
        <p>The researchers asked the men a series of questions to determine how aggressive they were. The men were asked about actions as diverse as skipping school and fighting with weapons.</p>
        <p>Although the men who were more aggressive were found to have stronger immune systems, highly aggressive men appeared to lose the benefit.</p>
        <p>There are several possible explanations. Historically, man in the wild fared best by being aggressive in finding food and protecting his family. But those behaviors, the researchers said, risked injury -- and infection. Perhaps in response, stronger immune systems evolved.</p>
        <p>Dr. Douglas A. Granger, an author of the paper who teaches biobehavioral health at Penn State, said the researchers' data was limited to men, but he noted that, in general, women appeared to have stronger immune systems than men.</p>
