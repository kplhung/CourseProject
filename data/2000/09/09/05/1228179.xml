        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Medical Schools Discover Value in Dispensing Compassion'' (Aug. 22): The Albert Einstein College of Medicine was onto this in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>I was one of those violinists with experiences beyond the usual pre-med student, and I sought a career in medicine after battling a chronic injury that prevented me from continuing in music and after living through the death of my father to cancer.</p>
        <p>It was important to me to attend a medical school that emphasized the human aspect of medicine in my interviews. Some interviews were demoralizing; the schools had no interest in my life beyond my pre-med performance.</p>
        <p>But interviewers at Einstein delighted in my varied experiences, and I was not disappointed once I entered.</p>
        <p>Before our first cadaver dissection, a special hour of nondenominational prayer and respect was paid to those whose bodies we were about to invade with our scalpels. I will thank my ''cadaver'' forever for giving her body to me to help me learn.</p>
        <p>In my first year we had an elective that involved following a single mother through pregnancy, birth and beyond. In the second year, I elected a rotation in a hospice center to learn about pain control, death and dying. And, we had interviews with real and practice patients to get feedback on our interpersonal skills.</p>
        <p>Despite their efforts and my interest in internal medicine, the reality of the times showed me that psychiatry was the only subspecialty that allowed enough time to really talk to patients. Even now, managed care is taking away the talking relationship from the psychiatrist and giving it to non-M.D. therapists. But that's a topic for another letter.</p>
        <p>DR. L. JANE MACDONNELL  Stamford, Conn.</p>
