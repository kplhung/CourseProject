        <p>In recent months, researchers have pointed to possible signals of Alzheimer's disease that could allow doctors to detect the ailment before symptoms start. They have spoken of small areas of the brain that appear to shrink, and psychological tests that yield subtle clues.</p>
        <p>Now scientists think they may have found another clue: smell.</p>
        <p>Writing in this month's American Journal of Psychiatry, researchers say that problems identifying aromas may indicate early Alzheimer's, but only when the patients do not realize that something is amiss with the sense of smell. A sense of smell often declines with age.</p>
        <p>Dr. D. P. Devanand, who practices at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and teaches at Columbia, based the theory on a study of 90 patients who were suffering memory problems or cognitive impairment.</p>
        <p>Researchers kept track of 77 of the patients for about two years and found that 19 ended up with Alzheimer's.</p>
        <p>The patients were given a multiple-choice test in which they were exposed to 40 smells, among them peanuts and menthol, and asked to identify them.</p>
        <p>After analyzing the results, Dr. Devanand observed that a poor sense of smell by itself was not a predictor for Alzheimer's, but patients who did badly on the test while saying they had no problems with their sense of smell appeared more likely to develop the disease.</p>
