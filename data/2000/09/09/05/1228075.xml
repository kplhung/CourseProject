        <p>As we head full force into the presidential campaign, one thing is certain. George W. Bush and Al Gore both seem determined to spend a significant portion of the nation's budget surplus.</p>
        <p>The surpluses are now expected to total about $4.5 trillion over the next decade, and the economic programs of both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore could absorb as much as half that amount. If the Social Security balance is stripped out of the 10-year budget projections, the candidates then propose to spend virtually all of the remaining surplus.</p>
        <p>They would spend the projected budgetary windfall in different ways. The Bush plan is far more focused on tax relief. The Gore plan is heavily skewed toward spending on health care and education. But these differences are less important than the common thrust of their budget policies.</p>
        <p>If either of these plans comes to pass, the political economy of the 1990's, which helped drive the country's longest period of prosperity, could be turned inside out. The era of fiscal restraint would be over. The days of fiscal expansion would be back.</p>
        <p>Politicians argue that it is the people's money, and that they have every right to reclaim what is rightfully theirs. Economists see it differently. The United States is a savings-short nation -- that is, American consumers set aside next to nothing of their current income for savings. In fact, the personal saving rate has now slipped into negative territory, hitting an all-time low in June of minus two-tenths of 1 percent as a share of disposable personal income.</p>
        <p>But our economy still has huge financing needs. Funds for investing in new technologies, other capital equipment, offices, factories and homes must come from somewhere.</p>
        <p>A savings-short America now gets this money from two sources -- the federal government's savings (that is, the surplus) and capital from abroad. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore are, in effect, proposing to eliminate one of the two major sources of saving that America must now rely on.</p>
        <p>Moreover, notwithstanding optimistic projections of the future, today's America is a nation in debt. Federal debt held by the public totals $3.4 trillion. The United States also owes $1.1 trillion to overseas investors, making it by far the world's largest debtor nation. In that context, it seems almost ludicrous to go on a federally financed spending binge. It would be far more prudent to simply pay down the debt.</p>
        <p>Moreover, these projected surpluses may never come about. Today's 10-year projections are based on rosy scenarios that are strikingly reminiscent of those offered by the Reagan administration in the 1980's -- no recessions, no inflation and no interest-rate gyrations.</p>
        <p>Such cockeyed optimism should raise suspicions. Should those forecasts fall wide of the mark and should politicians commit to tax cuts or huge increases in spending, the days of budget deficits could return with a vengeance.</p>
        <p>It wasn't all that long ago -- 1993 to be precise -- when the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the federal government would be running a $455 billion deficit in the current fiscal year. Instead, this year's budget could well have a surplus in excess of $225 billion, meaning the budget office was off by a whopping $700 billion when it tried to project far ahead.</p>
        <p>But let's say our prosperity continues and the optimistic budget projections come to pass. What then? In that case, increases in spending and tax cuts are probably ill-timed.</p>
        <p>While the pace of our economic growth may be easing a bit from the heady gains of the past few years, the unemployment rate -- 4.1 percent in August -- remains near its lowest in a generation.</p>
        <p>Large spending initiatives or tax cuts, like those being proposed by the candidates, typically boost the economy's growth rate. This move might lead to an overheated economy, where too much growth accelerates inflation, at just the time when most believe the battle against inflation has been won.</p>
        <p>Offering tax cuts and increased government spending may play well on the campaign trail. But fiscal prudence has been central to America's newfound prosperity. It would be tragic to squander those gains for the sake of political expediency. Both candidates should pause for thought before turning back the fiscal clock.</p>
