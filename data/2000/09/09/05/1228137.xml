        <p>Negotiators for Bridgestone/Firestone and the union representing 8,000 of its workers reached a tentative settlement yesterday, averting a strike that could have deepened the tire maker's crisis.</p>
        <p>The settlement, reached at 2:30 a.m. after five days of talks, gives most union members a large pension increase and a big pay raise, ranging from 12 percent to 25 percent over three years, depending on a worker's base pay.</p>
        <p>Officials with the United Steelworkers of America praised the settlement for its generosity. Bridgestone/Firestone officials hailed the accord because it would prevent a shutdown threatened at 9 of its 11 United States factories. ''The new agreement involves gains in all areas,'' said Wayne Ranick, a union spokesman. He said the ratification vote might take about two weeks.</p>
        <p>Harry Katz, a professor of industrial relations at Cornell, called the agreement ''a pretty solid package,'' adding, ''Recent union settlements have been 3 to 4 percent a year, and this seems much stronger than that.''</p>
        <p>Struggling to repair its image and to recall and replace 6.5 million tires linked to accidents and scores of deaths, Bridgestone/Firestone, a Japanese-owned concern, could have ill afforded a strike. Union officials said a strike would have badly delayed the company's efforts to produce replacement tires, a process the company says will take at least six months.</p>
        <p>Last week, Federal officials said they were investigating whether three Firestone brands were connected to 88 traffic deaths possibly caused when treads came off the tires. In an unusual move, Federal regulators warned consumers on Friday that 1.4 million additional Bridgestone/ Firestone tires the company has refused to recall could pose safety risks and should be replaced.</p>
        <p>Labor experts said the union's strategy of threatening a strike when Bridgestone/ Firestone was so vulnerable appeared to have paid off. Despite a reputation for fiercely battling unions, the company, whose United States unit is based in Nashville, was far more generous in the new settlement than one reached in 1996.</p>
        <p>That agreement took a rancorous 27 months, including a 10-month strike during which the company enraged the union and the entire labor movement by hiring 2,300 permanent replacement workers.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, the company is quite vulnerable right now,'' Professor Katz said. ''It's got a public image problem. It needs to get a lot of production right away. So it's hard to imagine them taking a big strike with all their other problems.''</p>
        <p>Saul Solomon, Bridgestone/Firestone's chief negotiator, said the company was pleased with the agreement, which was reached in talks at a hotel in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>''We believe the settlement is very fair and competitive for both sides,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''We believe we will be able to maintain our competitive position.''</p>
        <p>The settlement, actually three different agreements covering nine plants, will give most of the 8,000 workers a retroactive cost-of-living raise next month of about $1.60 an hour. That money comes from a cost-of-living reserve that the company had not distributed for several years at a number of plants because workers had not achieved certain production goals.</p>
        <p>In addition, the workers will receive a raise of 20 cents an hour when the contract is ratified, another 20 cents an hour on Sept. 1, 2001 and 25 cents an hour more on Sept. 1, 2002. Beyond that, the workers will receive quarterly cost-of-living adjustments, no longer contingent upon their meeting production goals.</p>
        <p>All told, the workers will receive raises of at least $2.25 an hour over the contract's three years. Under the expired contract, pay ranged from $9 an hour for new workers to $19 an hour for experienced ones.</p>
        <p>At a picnic at a worker's home near the company's plant in LaVergne, Tenn., nearly 100 union members were drinking beer, playing volleyball and rejoicing. ''We came out real good,'' said Mike Solomon, who has worked in the plant for 25 years. ''Now we can get back to the business of building tires. We got a lot of replacement tires to build. I think it's a good deal for everybody.''</p>
        <p>The workers were also jubilant about the pension increase. At most of the factories, the settlement will lift the monthly pension for a worker who retires with 30 years' experience to $1,500 a month, from the old level of either $1,020 or $1,230, depending on various factors.</p>
        <p>Tracy Russell, who has worked for 12 years at the LaVergne factory, said that the pension levels under the old contract were so low, he had started to wonder if he should look for a new job that provided a more generous retirement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russell said he was delighted by what would amount to an raise of nearly 50 percent for many retirees. ''Everybody feels so good about the contract,'' he said. ''The last eight years, they've taken so much away from us. It hasn't been money issues so much as it's been work rules.''</p>
        <p>In another gain sought by the union, the tentative agreement gives more weight to a workers' seniority when factories fill certain jobs and work shifts.</p>
        <p>Union members also said they were pleased that the contract improves death benefits, grievance procedures and what the workers' say is an overly strict policy on absences. Under the old contract, three absences in a six-month period, even ones for which workers had doctors' notes, resulted in reprimands that could ultimately lead to dismissal.</p>
        <p>Union officials said they had also won back several concessions that they had made in the 1994 to 1996 labor dispute.</p>
        <p>Christine Karbowiak, a spokeswoman with Bridgestone/Firestone, issued a statement saying the settlement serves ''the best interests of our customers, our employees and our company.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''While compromise was required from the United Steelworkers of America and Bridgestone/Firestone, neither has -- nor will -- compromise on any issue affecting product quality.''</p>
        <p>The union had threatened strikes at six factories covered by a master contract that expired on April 23. They are in Akron, Ohio; Decatur, Ill., Des Moines; Noblesville, Ind.; Oklahoma City; and Russellville, Ark. The strike would have also involved three other factories -- in Bloomington, Ill., LaVergne, Tenn., and Warren County, Tenn. -- covered by separate contracts.</p>
        <p>Under yesterday's settlement, the LaVergne factory will be covered by the master agreement, while Bloomington and Warren will still remain under separate contracts.</p>
