        <p>DaimlerChrysler, which has based its hopes for Asian expansion on a partnership with Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, is demanding more control in the wake of a scandal over defective cars that has engulfed Mitsubishi.</p>
        <p>In a brief statement today, a spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart confirmed that ''we are in talks about the future of the alliance'' in the context of ''the current challenges facing Mitsubishi Motor Company.''</p>
        <p>Daimler executives said they wanted more control over Mitsubishi, in which Daimler had been planning to pay $2 billion for a 34 percent stake. But they refused to say what form that control might take.</p>
        <p>NHK, a Japanese television network, reported today that Daimler executives were demanding that their stake be increased at no extra cost to 40 percent.</p>
        <p>That would make Daimler the biggest shareholder in Mitsubishi Motors, bigger even than the Mitsubishi Corporation. But other options include increasing the number of Daimler executives on Mitsubishi Motors' board from three to four and winning the right to oust and name a replacement for Mitsubishi Motors' president, Katsuhiko Kawasoe.</p>
        <p>Two of Daimler's top executives, Eckhard Cordes and Manfred Bischoff, met last Friday with Minoru Makihara, the chairman of the Mitsubishi Corporation.</p>
        <p>Regardless of what happens, the Mitsubishi scandal poses Daimler's chairman, Jurgen E. Schrempp, with major problems on opposite sides of the world.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the merger and de facto takeover of the Chrysler Corporation two years ago has been followed by steadily dwindling profit margins and the resignations of many top Chrysler executives, including its chairman, Robert Eaton, and its president, Thomas Stallkamp.</p>
        <p>Just last week, DaimlerChrysler surprised and irritated industry analysts by abruptly canceling a meeting with them scheduled for this week. The cancellation stirred speculation that Daimler was either planning another management shake-up or pondering the release of more bad financial news.</p>
        <p>In Asia, Mitsubishi Motors was supposed to strengthen DaimlerChrysler's tiny presence. But last month, just a few weeks after the two companies agreed on the final details of their pact, Mitsubishi Motors announced the recall of nearly one million cars and was forced to admit that it started keeping defects secret two decades ago.</p>
        <p>The defects included faulty fuel tanks, clutches, crankshafts and brakes. Since 1977, Mitsubishi admitted two weeks ago, managers had suppressed information about consumer complaints, making repairs in secret and keeping record of the repairs on separate books that were concealed from government inspectors.</p>
        <p>The scandal is not yet over. On Sunday, the police raided Mitsubishi offices for the second time in search of documents that might provide the basis for charges of a criminal cover-up.</p>
        <p>Financially, the problems with Mitsubishi are much less threatening to Daimler than the slump at Chrysler, which has caused Daimler shares to be among the worst performing of Germany's blue chips.</p>
        <p>But Mitsubishi could prove much more difficult for Daimler to turn around and use as a base for expanding its Asian presence.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the problems could give Daimler executives leverage that they have not been able to acquire so far.</p>
        <p>Although acquiring 34 percent of Mitsubishi Motors' shares as originally planned would give Daimler a veto over major board decisions, it would not give Mr. Schrempp or his lieutenants the power to dictate the details of a tough restructuring plan.</p>
        <p>By contrast, when Renault of France acquired a similar stake in Nissan Motor in 1999, one of its top executives, Carlos Ghosn, became tantamount to chief executive of the Japanese company and is extensively overhauling Nissan.</p>
        <p>Part of the difference is that Nissan has a much more dispersed shareholder base, making it easier for Renault to take command.</p>
        <p>As chairman of DaimlerChrysler, Mr. Schrempp has repeatedly shown a determination to seize control. Though the deal with Chrysler was called a merger of equals, Mr. Schrempp overshadowed Mr. Eaton from the first day, and Chrysler is now merely the American subsidiary of a Stuttgart corporation.</p>
        <p>Tighter control has not yet brought Mr. Schrempp greater rewards, however. Though the Mercedes-Benz operations are generally thriving, the Chrysler business has been hammered by competition in the United States, and the company has only been able to maintain sales growth by giving customers ever-more generous discounts and thereby sacrificing profitability.</p>
        <p>The steady erosion of Chrysler's authority within DaimlerChrysler could also hinder the restructuring of Mitsubishi Motors. For more than a decade, Chrysler has had a broad working relationship with Mitsubishi that included a jointly owned factory in Normal, Ill.</p>
        <p>That experience could give Chrysler executives better insight into Mitsubishi Motors' problems and people. But given Mr. Schrempp's frustrations with Chrysler, it is doubtful he will trust Mitsubishi's recovery to its managers.</p>
        <p>Separately, DaimlerChrysler faces a potentially ticklish legal issue if it pushes for too much control of Mitsubishi Motors.</p>
        <p>Christian Breitsprecher, an automobile analyst at Deutsche Bank, said that if Daimler were perceived to have taken control of Mitsubishi Motors, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission could force it to consolidate Mitsubishi Motors' results with its own.</p>
        <p>''That would be a disaster because  Daimler would have to consolidate all of Mitsubishi's debt,'' Mr. Breitsprecher said today.</p>
        <p>Karin Funke, a spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler, said talks with Mitsubishi Motors have been ''fruitful and cooperative'' and should result in an agreement in ''the very near future.''</p>
