        <p>The landslide defeat of the Syrian-appointed government by the billionaire builder Rafik Hariri in elections that concluded on Sunday has changed the political map of Lebanon overnight.</p>
        <p>But the most intriguing aspect of the sudden shift has been speculated about in whispers under the din of celebratory fireworks, car horns and street dancing that went on until nearly dawn today. It is why Syria's new ruler, Bashar al-Assad, allowed this to happen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hariri's victory came less than three months after the death of President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, who had run both countries with an iron hand for the last 10 years and had meddled in the murky waters of Lebanon since 1976.</p>
        <p>During those years, two Lebanese presidents and a prime minister perished in mysterious explosions. Political opponents, critical journalists and errant guerrilla leaders were regularly assassinated, and countless thousands of civilians died, all as a result of machinations universally attributed here to Syria.</p>
        <p>The last decade has so entrenched Syria's dominance that virtually all of the players on the Lebanese political scene -- Mr. Hariri not least among them -- have ties to Syria. Damascus, a foreign envoy noted, ''is in the happy situation of having to deal with friends.''</p>
        <p>But the election victory by Mr. Hariri and his allies crushed President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim al-Hoss. The two men were handpicked by Bashar al-Assad to run Lebanon two years ago after his father sent him to Lebanon as an internship for power.</p>
        <p>Bashar al-Assad, a 34-year-old eye doctor, was raised to power by the ruling Baath Party, the generals and the Alawite minority clique running Syria. Even four weeks ago, the defeat of his candidates would have seemed unthinkable.</p>
        <p>''The locals are interpreting their mandates rather more widely than they would have under his father,'' Michael Young, a respected political analyst here, said dryly.</p>
        <p>But is Bashar al-Assad truly, as Syria's official media said, determined to foster a new era of freedom? Or is Dr. Assad, a mild-mannered computer enthusiast, just not tough enough for the job of keeping the fractious Lebanese in line? Has he shifted his patronage, or has he let the situation slip out of control?</p>
        <p>''That's going to be the most interesting question of the next few months,'' a Western diplomat said this afternoon.</p>
        <p>As the official tallies were counted up today, Beirut newspapers estimated that Mr. Hariri and his allies had taken 92 of the 128 seats in Parliament, an overwhelming majority that would seem to make it impossible for President Lahoud to deny him the office of prime minister, which he held from 1992 to 1998.</p>
        <p>Late Sunday night, the president issued a statement saying the new government would be formed, ''in line with the Constitution,'' when the new Parliament assembles in mid-October, implying that he would avoid a crisis by appointing his sworn enemy, Mr. Hariri, to be prime minister.</p>
        <p>''How are they going to work together?'' the Western diplomat wondered. ''It is very difficult. These are two very strong-willed people.''</p>
        <p>The overwhelming extent of Mr. Hariri's victory was shown by his elimination of two pillars of the Sunni Muslim establishment in West Beirut. The city had been gerrymandered into three districts under Syrian orders to preserve the power of two traditional leaders and to prevent the emergence of a single dominant leader.</p>
        <p>But that that balance was wiped out by Mr. Hariri's campaign. One of those leaders is Mr. Hoss, a five-time prime minister, who was beaten by 11,000 votes by an unknown computer professor, Ghanwa Jalloul, the first woman ever elected to Parliament from the city.</p>
        <p>Bashar al-Assad did not grow up intending to rule Syria -- or Lebanon. That role was reserved for his dashing older brother, Basil, who died in a car crash in 1994. Bashar al-Assad was plucked from his medical studies in London, sent through military training, made a colonel and apprenticed to his father.</p>
        <p>He was given the task of running Lebanon in 1998 as part of his training program. At the time, the country was the turf of the veteran Syrian vice president, Abdul Halim Khaddam, and of Maj. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan, of military intelligence, both of whom had been in charge here for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>Both were close to -- many said in the pocket of -- Mr. Hariri, then the free-spending prime minister. In recent weeks he has recemented his ties by pledging with three Saudi-based construction agencies to carry out projects in Syria that could total as much as $400 million.</p>
        <p>Instead of working through the older men, both in his father's inner circle, Dr. Assad struck out on his own, anointing Mr. Lahoud, the military commander, as president. That forced a power struggle in which Mr. Hariri departed and the decent, long-suffering Mr. Hoss was named to replace him.</p>
        <p>''Bashar brought this guy in,'' said Mr. Young, the Lebanese political analyst. ''He failed. Someone, somewhere is keeping score.</p>
        <p>''People in the Syrian system are looking to see how Bashar gets out of this one.''</p>
        <p>While President Lahoud had accused Mr. Hariri of corruption and of running the country into debt, matters only got worse under the new administration.</p>
        <p>To voters on Sunday, Mr. Hariri suddenly seemed the economic savior, particularly to Sunni Muslims, who had no strong leader and were the biggest voters in Lebanon's complicated balloting, intricately divided by religious sect. But the problems that Mr. Hariri faces are enormous, and there is little evidence that his solutions will work.</p>
        <p>As the election struggle became more bitter, most of the major figures in Lebanon trooped to Damascus to sit with Dr. Assad, as they had so often when summoned by his father. But the signals that came out of the meetings seemed mixed, and the situation different. Dr. Assad did not hold the icy menace of his father.</p>
        <p>''We can't go back to before '98 when every problem was solved in Damascus,'' Mr. Young said. ''Syria has changed. We have changed. Israel is gone from the south. I don't think the Lebanese will willingly return to being so obviously under the Syrian thumb.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Young said the idea of a change ''has really entered the public domain.''</p>
        <p>''It's always phrased very carefully,'' he said. ''Let's recognize a 'new relationship' rather than a direct call for a Syrian pullout.</p>
        <p>''Bashar is in a dilemma. He is certainly in a tight spot. Can he find a way of operating alternatively in this country? That's at the heart of this entire episode.''</p>
