        <p>Two television networks that were left out of Gov. George W. Bush's plan to impose his own schedule of debates declared yesterday that they had no intention of carrying presidential debates sponsored by rival networks.</p>
        <p>The Bush proposal, announced on Sunday after intense negotiations with officials of six cable and broadcast networks, has thrown into turmoil the work of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the panel created in 1987 by the Democrats and Republicans to avoid squabbling over the debates. Since the creation of the panel, no candidate has gone so far to circumvent its work.</p>
        <p>But campaigning yesterday, Mr. Bush said that by rejecting his proposal, Mr. Gore was ducking debates and going back on his word to face off with him at any time. [Page A22.]</p>
        <p>The Gore camp countered that Mr. Bush was trying to tailor the debates to his own liking, then blame Mr. Gore for rejecting them.</p>
        <p>Janet Brown, the commission's executive director, said the panel had asked officials of both the Bush and Gore campaigns to a meeting in Washington this week to work out an agreement under which Mr. Bush would consent to the commission's schedule.</p>
        <p>''We continue to believe our proposal is the best one,'' Ms. Brown said. ''I believe the campaigns when they say they want to debate in a way that reaches the maximum number of people, and the way to do that is to implement the commission's plan.''</p>
        <p>In January, the commission announced its plans for three 90-minute debates in October on college campuses in Boston, Winston-Salem, N.C., and St. Louis, a plan that Vice President Al Gore quickly endorsed. On Sunday, Mr. Bush unveiled his own proposal, which would include the debate in St. Louis but would replace the others with encounters next week on a prime-time edition of ''Meet the Press'' with Tim Russert on NBC, and on Oct. 3 on CNN's ''Larry King Live.'' Mr. Bush's plan calls for 60-minute forums.</p>
        <p>But executives of ABC and CBS, two of the networks that Mr. Bush turned down, made it clear that they would not devote air time to what they viewed chiefly as promotional opportunities for Mr. Russert and Mr. King.</p>
        <p>''I think that it might be in the interest of some of the parties involved to call them debates, but these are basically versions of existing talk shows, and we don't normally air other people's talk shows,'' said Andrew Heyward, the president of CBS News.</p>
        <p>Paul Friedman, the executive vice president of ABC News, echoed Mr. Heyward, saying, ''It's very unlikely we would cover other networks' programs, and that is essentially what they are.''</p>
        <p>NBC and CNN have both offered to allow their debates to be broadcast live by all the networks.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Bush said they remained convinced that if pressure were brought to bear on the vice president to appear with Mr. Bush on the two programs, other networks would be compelled to put the debates on the air.</p>
        <p>''I do suspect that if Al Gore were to show up on 'Meet the Press,' '' said one top Bush official, ''all the networks, with their dedication to public service, would be hard-pressed not to cover it.''</p>
        <p>It was clear that many of the networks were feeling slightly uncomfortable over any role they may be playing in subverting the work of the debate commission. Privately, some broadcast journalists expressed outrage at what they viewed as the networks' allowing themselves to be used by the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>''What's going on here is a maneuvering for position, and journalists should be very wary of getting roped into that,'' said Mr. Heyward of CBS.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, CBS was among the networks that made a pitch to Mr. Bush for a debate. Mr. Heyward explained, however, that a debate on ''Face the Nation'' had been offered, but only if the commission's plan fell apart.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to get drawn into where the network broadcasts were used as bargaining chips,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In its offer letter, CNN wrote both campaigns that its debate would ''encompass a typical 'Larry King Live' format.'' The network proposed two coin tosses -- ''one for seat preference and one for question order'' -- and asserted that the program would not take viewer calls or use video clips.</p>
        <p>Bill Wheatley, vice president of NBC News, said his network had long ago made an offer to both camps for a ''Meet the Press'' debate. ''And in recent weeks,'' he added, ''as it became clear that there was going to be further discussion on the nature of the debates, we pressed home that request, saying that 'you could have a 'Meet the Press' in prime time.' ''</p>
        <p>NBC has found itself in the position of being championed by the Bush campaign over the debate issue. In an e-mail message to reporters yesterday, Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said Mr. Gore was now ''backpedaling'' from a commitment made months ago to debate on ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>''Governor Bush believes the first debate should allow for more than just sound bites; it should feature an in-depth discussion of the issues and have tough questioning,'' Mr. Fleischer wrote. ''Having the first debate on 'Meet the Press' will allow such an exchange.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wheatley, however, brushed aside any suggestion that the Bush campaign was using NBC as a means of undoing the commission. He added that scheduling the program in September would be a service to viewers.</p>
        <p>''We believe that our proposal gives the public an opportunity to give these men a chance to debate a month earlier,'' Mr. Wheatley said.  ''Otherwise, the commission debates don't begin until October.''</p>
        <p>The commission was established not only to eliminate this sort of jockeying, but also to ensure that the debates could be seen by the most viewers across as many channels as possible. In one debate in 1992, for instance, 92 million viewers tuned in.</p>
        <p>While previous candidates, including President Clinton in 1996 and Mr. Bush's father in 1992, have tried to tinker with the format or scheduling of the debates, none before have tried to set up debates without it.</p>
        <p>For the commission, the Bush plan is a potentially serious disruption of its mission. ''All the debates have been in communities, on campuses, or in towns,'' Ms. Brown said. ''These are the single set of political events that the public still thinks belongs to them. We believe taking them to communities where thousands of young people can participate is a very good thing that can't take place if you do two debates in television studios.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown said she hoped to be able to convince Mr. Bush's aides that the commission plan is an enhanced version of the proposal they have offered. ''We think campuses are preferable to studios,'' she said, ''and we believe that six networks are preferable to one or two.''</p>
