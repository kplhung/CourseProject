        <p>MARTINA HINGIS sprayed her trademark winners around the Grandstand Court yesterday, played her sharp angles, and quietly moved on to the quarterfinals of the United States Open, a sly cat under a white baseball cap.</p>
        <p>The resumption of her Sunday night match with France's Sandrine Testud was as brief as a sun shower, finishing, 6-2, 6-1, and sending Hingis into a fast-emptying interview room as the follow-up act to Serena Williams.</p>
        <p>''It's more pressure on them,'' Hingis said of the fascination with everyone named Williams these days inside the National Tennis Center. ''They have to do well and make the results. For me, it's never been the talk.''</p>
        <p>Not entirely true, as Hingis has had her share of oral food fights with the family Williams, in addition to those intemperate, homophobic-sounding remarks she made regarding Amelie Mauresmo a couple of winters ago at the Australian Open.</p>
        <p>Well, Hingis was only 18 at the time, riding impossibly high with her fifth -- and last -- Grand Slam singles title. Now, her sorority crowded with contemporaries who dwarf her 5-foot-7-inch frame, her 20th birthday only 25 days away, she somehow seems undeterred by the calamity of less attention. Better yet, she began this tournament by stating for the record that she would under no circumstances do anything potentially harmful to get it.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to die when I'm 30,'' she said when asked if she had considered using creatine and other supplements in an effort to become stronger, more Williams-ready. ''I'm scared of that stuff. My life is too nice right now.''</p>
        <p>These remarks, augmented by her stated desire to remain fast and lean, were reported, and pretty much forgotten within one 24-hour news cycle. They weren't angry, like the ravings of Damir Dokic, banished father of Jelena. They weren't as provocative as that knee-jerk gender commentary from the mouth of John McEnroe.</p>
        <p>Hingis's quotes just needed to be written in stone and presented like a mantra to all young athletes in our enhancement-crazed culture. ''It was a real positive because what she was saying is that she needs to focus on her own strength, her speed and cunning, and not try to become something she's not,'' said Dr. Brian Hainline, the tournament physician and the co-author of the 1989 book ''Drugs and the Athlete.'' ''What I would hope for is that young people could really hear what she's saying and that message could take off. Because the bigger question of whether creatine is harmful or helpful, or if androstenedione made a difference in Mark McGwire hitting home runs, is why pharmacology has become an integral part of what young athletes believe is needed to win.''</p>
        <p>If ever there has been a candidate to succumb to the sad notion of the body as an experimental tool, it is Hingis, who ruled the Tour before Lindsay Davenport harnessed her power ground strokes. Before, as Serena Williams said yesterday, ''Venus and I lifted the bar.'' Hingis is too pure a player to ever overlook. The computer still acknowledges her as No. 1. But the buzz is clearly not around her anymore. McEnroe and Donald Trump won't be challenging her to a battle of the sexes anytime soon.</p>
        <p>''Vain, probably,'' Hingis said the other day on the subject of McEnroe and his claim that any college male or senior player (read: himself) could handle either Williams. Jealous, too, like the neglected jock whose last cry for attention is, inevitably, ''Let's arm wrestle.''</p>
        <p>What was McEnroe's point? There was none, other than to apparently remind us that the men may be boring, but they're bigger. Twist the logic and the implication is that men are better, the more enhanced sex.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's necessary to say things like this,'' Hingis said. ''I mean, I'm playing on the women's tour.''</p>
        <p>The men are not her problem, not even when her new boyfriend's got problems. While Magnus Norman struggled in his five-set comeback against Max Mirnyi Sunday night, Hingis said she grew exasperated by the length of her wait to get on the same court against Testud.</p>
        <p>''At four-all, I had no more feelings,'' she said. ''I was like, 'Come on, get it over.' ''</p>
        <p>Norman survived, and Hingis and Testud eventually played a set and a game before the rain sent them inside for the night. Hingis awoke yesterday at 9, hit a few practice balls, finished off Testud and began thinking about Monica Seles, next up in the quarters.</p>
        <p>She'll have to deal with the Williamses later this week and for the next several years. Her promise to do it with what comes natural is a powerful message, a winner on all courts.</p>
