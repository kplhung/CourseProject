        <p>Europe's second-largest express package delivery company, TNT Post Groep, said it had bought CTI Logistx from the CSX Corporation, the United States railroad concern, for $650 million in cash. The deal was announced in concert with TNT's first half earnings. The company said its income, including profits on the sale of noncore business, grew 25.1 percent, to 229 million euros. Revenue jumped 19.5 percent, to 4.7 billion euros. The acquisition of CTI is TNT's largest purchase since it went public in 1998. It brings TNT one step closer to a transformation from a regional post office to a global logistics company.</p>
