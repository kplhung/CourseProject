        <p>A Yonkers man who the police said had a history of domestic violence was charged today in the stabbing deaths of his live-in girlfriend and two of her young children, officials said.</p>
        <p>The woman, Patricia Torres, 28, was found dead Sunday morning along with her son William Santiago, 8, and daughter, Ashley Dominguez, 5, in her apartment. The police charged her boyfriend, Dennis Salvador Alvarez, 23, with three counts of second-degree murder in the killings. They said he stabbed Ms. Torres and the children several times each with a penknife, and then stabbed himself in the neck and chest, but survived.</p>
        <p>Ms. Torres's son Vincent, 9, was also stabbed, but managed to crawl out a window from their first-floor apartment and reach his grandparents' home next door, the family said.</p>
        <p>There, naked, and bloody from knife wounds to the neck and chest, Vincent tried to awaken his grandparents, Rodolfo and Sergia Torres, Ms. Torres's parents.</p>
        <p>''He was holding the fence and crying, 'My mom, my mom, my mom is dead on the floor,' '' said Maria Ventura, who lives on the floor above Ms. Torres's apartment and said she was awakened by the screaming.</p>
        <p>After waking up his grandmother, the boy told her of the stabbings and then collapsed. He was listed in critical condition today in Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Torres, 61, called the police, Mr. Torres, 65, said he ran into his daughter's apartment and found the bodies. The two children were on the top bunk of their beds. ''At first I thought they were sleeping,'' Mr. Torres said, ''but then I saw the bodies covered in blood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torres, a Yonkers factory worker, said he grew suspicious entering the apartment because loud music was coming from the stereo, unusual for 8 a.m. on a Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarez, a construction worker who immigrated from Honduras in 1998, was arraigned today in a hospital bed at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers, where he was in stable condition and was being held without bail, Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, said in a news conference in White Plains.</p>
        <p>Asked whether she would recommend that Mr. Alvarez receive the death penalty if convicted, Mrs. Pirro would only say that a grand jury will review the evidence and determine whether to charge Mr. Alvarez with first-degree murder.</p>
        <p>''To see two children stabbed to death in their own beds is a gruesome, grisly crime scene,'' the district attorney said.</p>
        <p>Noting that the couple had a history of violence, Mrs. Pirro said the incident shows that, if not addressed, ''domestic violence escalates as time goes on.''</p>
        <p>Charles Cola, the Yonkers police chief, said at the news conference that his officers had responded several times to complaints of disturbances at Ms. Torres's apartment on Maple Avenue, a street lined with older walk-up apartment buildings. Her parents live in the building next door, and Mr. Alvarez's parents live in the next building.</p>
        <p>Ms. Torres began dating Mr. Alvarez last year and let him move into her apartment with her and her children, all from previous boyfriends. Her oldest child, Rodolfo, 10, lives with her parents next door.</p>
        <p>The slayings did not surprise some neighbors in the Nodine Hill section of Yonkers, a gritty working-class neighborhood with a diverse Hispanic population. But others were stunned. Many called Mr. Alvarez a friendly man who treated Ms. Torres's children as though they were his own and watched them frequently when she was working, most recently as a secretary.</p>
        <p>But others spoke of intense arguments between them, which were often so loud that neighbors called the police. Some said Ms. Torres had obtained a restraining order against him, but she inevitably forgave him and took him back, against the wishes of her parents.</p>
        <p>Most of the neighbors interviewed said Mr. Alvarez drank a lot. Ms. Torres's brother, Javier Torres, 29, a taxi dispatcher from Brooklyn, said that Mr. Alvarez recently tried to run over Ms. Torres in his car after an argument in a local nightclub, and then smashed her car windows.</p>
        <p>But she would not heed her family's urgings to end the relationship, in part because Mr. Alvarez treated her children well.</p>
        <p>''How do you care for children and then kill them?'' Javier Torres said as his mother swept her kitchen. When a neighbor entered offering her consolation, his mother fell into the neighbor's arms weeping.</p>
        <p>Dennis Alvarez's father, Salvador Alvarez, said his son still has a 2-year-old child in Honduras.</p>
        <p>Since his son moved in with Ms. Torres, he said, the couple had become a common bond for the two families. In fact, it was Mr. Torres who knocked on his door yesterday to tell him that Mr. Alvarez's son had just killed his daughter.</p>
        <p>''I feel very bad and empty inside,'' Mr. Alvarez said. ''I want to know what happened.'' He said he had little to do with Dennis, one of his five sons. He said that Dennis drank a lot, but added with a shrug, ''I drink too, but I stay responsible.''</p>
        <p>Inside Ms. Torres's apartment today, as police gathered evidence, a football game played on a television in the kitchen. Outside, there were sullen looks on the faces of the young children sitting on nearby stoops. In front of the building, neighbors made a shrine of cardboard and candles and a portrait of Jesus.</p>
        <p>Evelyn Ruiz, who lived above Ms. Torres for four years but moved out three weeks ago, watched her children, Diana, 8, and Joshua, 9, place stuffed animals on the shrine. The children said they were ''best friends'' with Ms. Torres's children.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ruiz said she often heard the Ms. Torres and Mr. Alvarez fighting two floors down.</p>
        <p>''He used to beat her up pretty good,'' she recalled. ''My husband and I would hear the banging and go down and pull them apart. I knew one day he'd eventually kill her, but he was always taking care of the kids. If he did kill them, it's kind of strange.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ventura, 61, said the police had recently been called to the apartment.</p>
        <p>Jose Lopez, who lives on the block and knew Ms. Torres, said she and Mr. Alvarez had a fight Saturday night at the Flamingo Cafe in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>''They fought, but I'm surprised he butchered those kids like that,'' he said. ''I can't believe he would do that.''</p>
