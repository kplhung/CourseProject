        <p>Both United States bridge teams were in action here today at the World Bridge Championship, although one of them came within a hair of being eliminated on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>The American open team, playing against Argentina on Sunday, won convincingly by 76 imps. Today it faced Austria in the quarterfinal and led by 46 after 48 deals of a scheduled 80. The Austrians appeared to have been defeated in the previous round, but an appeal reversed the result, giving them a victory by 4 against Sweden.</p>
        <p>The United States women's team won Sunday night by 7 imps against Scotland in a match that was close throughout. Today the Americans faced a Dutch team (which has the Venice Cup world title) and led by 5 with 32 deals remaining. The Dutch had also had a narrow escape, winning their previous match by 6 against Israel.</p>
        <p>Two other teams in the open series survived narrowly Sunday night. England trailed Belgium by 38 going into the final 16-deal quarter, but a stretch drive gave them a victory by 5.

The favored Italian squad had won by 80 Sunday night against Australia.</p>
