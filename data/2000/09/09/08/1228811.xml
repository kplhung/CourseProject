        <p>A panel of expert scientists reported yesterday that after studying what were regarded as the leading suspected causes, it could not say what had brought on the array of symptoms called gulf war syndrome in thousands of veterans of the war against Iraq.</p>

        <p>A panel of expert scientists reported yesterday that after studying what were regarded as the leading suspected causes, it could not say what had brought on the array of symptoms called gulf war syndrome in thousands of veterans of the war against Iraq.</p>
        <p>The panel, which pored over studies of poison gas, uranium, drugs and vaccines, concluded that there was not enough reliable data to say whether exposure to any of those agents had caused the illnesses. The lack of data extended not only to the effects of the chemicals in question but also to the level of exposure that might have afflicted veterans of the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>The committee, of 18 members, was brought together by the Institute of Medicine, a body of the National Academy of Sciences. Its conclusions were announced yesterday at a  Washington news conference, where  Dr. Kenneth I. Shine, the institute's president, summed up the frustration of the panel's members and others seeking definitive findings.</p>
        <p>''We would love to come up with remarkable new conclusions,'' Dr. Shine said, ''but after careful analysis, if the data isn't there, we can't  draw any conclusions from it.''</p>
        <p>The committee recommended more scientific research but also urged that the military improve its monitoring of what happens to soldiers and their environment in any future war.</p>
        <p>Richard Weidman and William Frasure, officials of Vietnam Veterans of America, who have tracked the debate over gulf war syndrome for several years, said that given the scant data, they sympathized with the committee. What is needed, they said, is a thorough study of not only the existing scientific literature but also classified records on troop deployments and veterans' medical records, carried out not by military officials but by independent scientists.</p>
        <p>The symptoms of gulf war syndrome vary, but veterans have complained chiefly of fatigue, skin rash,  headache, muscle and joint pain, and memory loss.</p>
        <p>The committee's search for a cause followed studies by both the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Those earlier studies both found that there was a group of gulf war veterans suffering from a variety of symptoms, but could find no cause.</p>
        <p>After Congress mandated further study, the Institute of Medicine was asked by the V.A. to convene an expert impartial panel to look at 33 agents and try to determine whether any might be the cause. The committee began work early last year on what were considered the four most likely suspects among those 33 and, after a review of thousands of published, peer-reviewed scientific studies, addressed the four yesterday at the news conference and in a written report. (Under the Congressional mandate, the committee must now spend years looking at the 29 others.)</p>
        <p>The committee left open the question of whether two of those four agents, the nerve gas sarin and vaccinations against germ warfare,  might be the cause.</p>
        <p>''There is inadequate/insufficient evidence,'' the panel wrote, ''to determine whether an association does or does not exist between exposure to sarin at low doses'' and any subsequent ''long-term adverse health effects.''</p>
        <p>With regard to vaccinations against anthrax and botulinum, the committee's wording was identical.</p>
        <p>The committee felt there was at least some evidence that the two other agents, depleted uranium and the chemical pyridostigmine bromide, were unlikely to be the cause,  although again there was not enough evidence to be sure.</p>
        <p>The committee's chairman, Dr. Harold S. Sox Jr., said he felt that its  review did not ''move the needle'' toward any new conclusions on sarin or the vaccines. As for the depleted uranium and pyridostigmine bromide, Dr. Sox said, ''we did move the needle'' in that it now seems less likely that either was a cause of the syndrome. But he emphasized that  the study had been unable to rule  them out.</p>
        <p>These four agents were studied first for a variety of reasons.</p>
        <p>Sarin was suspected because it is a potent nerve toxin used in chemical weapons, some of which were destroyed during the gulf war, thus exposing soldiers to small doses.</p>
        <p>Vaccines became suspect because soldiers received two of them -- one against anthrax and one against botulinum toxin -- before serving in the gulf.</p>
        <p>Pyridostigmine bromide is a drug used to treat myasthenia gravis, but it can also blunt the effects of nerve gas, and so some soldiers were given preventive doses of it in the war.</p>
        <p>So-called depleted uranium, a low-radiation form of uranium, came under suspicion because it is used as a layer in the armor of tanks to increase protection, and is also used in some ammunition rounds. Soldiers were exposed to it during the cleanup of damaged tanks and in munitions  from ''friendly fire.''</p>
        <p>Overriding all the committee's conclusions was the constant refrain expressed at the news conference by its members that there was very little evidence of the kind needed to make conclusions on two points: whether low doses of any of the agents might cause long-term illness, and just how much exposure to the agents any veteran got.</p>
