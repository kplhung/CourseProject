        <p>Zabriskie Gallery</p>
        <p>41 East 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through Sept. 23</p>
        <p>This is the second New York show devoted to the paintings of Shirley Goldfarb (1925-1980), an American who moved permanently to Paris in 1954. Like the first exhibition two years ago at this gallery it leaves you wanting a fuller picture. Goldfarb was not a very original artist, but she had a determination to be contemporary and more important a technique that she loved.</p>
        <p>She applied what she called ''spots'' of paint to canvas with a palette knife -- and she pursued this approach from a gestural, Abstract Expressionist style into a more Minimalist one, making her first monochrome painting around 1970. Dated between 1968 and 1980, the seven paintings here emphasize the transition and final phase.</p>
        <p>The earliest are biggish canvases -- one predominantly yellow, the other predominantly blue-green -- in which the paint drifts across the canvas, a little like blowing leaves. In the later works Goldfarb compressed the strokes, eliminated the intervals of background space and created taut mosaics of color whose subtle fluctuations result from shifts in color or stroke and the uncontrollable variations of the human hand.</p>
        <p>In tiny paintings of gold and red, the paint is applied in thin, ridged strokes; in a big black one from 1980 the same strokes, worked vertically, create fringelike rows. But the strongest work here is ''1977,'' a large canvas covered in little squarish spots of white, green, yellow, yellow-green and peach whose surface expands, contracts and even undulates as you shift position in front of it, moving exuberantly from the literal to the optical and back again.</p>
