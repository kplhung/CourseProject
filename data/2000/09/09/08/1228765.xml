        <p>Ronald Reagan turned ''tax and spend'' into a near-fatal label for traditional Democrats.

        <p>Ronald Reagan turned ''tax and spend'' into a near-fatal label for traditional Democrats. One of President Clinton's big achievements has been to rebuild his party's reputation for budgetary restraint and fiscal discipline. Vice President Al Gore, with his carefully crafted economic plan, has been careful to preserve the political capital inherited from Mr. Clinton's success in reducing the federal debt. To be sure, the hefty document Mr. Gore released on Tuesday is as much a campaign manifesto as it is an economic blueprint. Indeed, by combining his previously proposed spending and tax-cutting ideas in one package, he directed attention to the stark differences between his policies and those of Gov. George W. Bush. What emerges is an economic program that is cautious almost to a fault, yet determinedly progressive in its general thrust. Mr. Gore has, properly, focused spending on families most in need.</p>
        <p>On the tactical level, Mr. Gore was smart to provide specifics, nearly 200 pages of them. Mr. Bush has so far refused to lay out his plans with equal precision, and his campaign advertisement saying that nearly 300 prominent economists endorse his general approach is not, in campaign terms, a totally satisfactory substitute for specific details.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore sets down 10 goals, including cutting poverty to an all-time low, eliminating federal debt by 2012, doubling the number of families with substantial savings, raising home ownership from its current 67 percent to 70 percent of the population by 2004 and college attendance rates from 66 percent to 75 percent by 2010. These goals are only loosely tied to the plan's specific provisions. The important directions are set by the big-ticket items.</p>
        <p>Over the next 10 years, the surplus is expected to exceed $4.5 trillion. Mr. Gore proposes to use about $3 trillion to reduce federal debt. By contrast, Mr. Bush's plan would reduce the debt by at most $1 trillion. Traditional Democratic liberals would much rather put this money into social programs, and we share a concern for the nation's unmet needs in health, housing and education. But debt reduction is clearly popular with centrist voters, who see it as a component of today's prosperity. Mr. Gore would be foolish to give away the Democrats' hard-won advantage on the issue of fiscal trustworthiness.</p>
        <p>The vice president would devote about $500 billion to ''targeted'' tax cuts, including a poorly designed tuition tax credit that will do more to enrich colleges than low-income families. But he also includes a $200 billion tax cut for retirement savings that heavily favors low-income families. He  proposes to increase tax credits for low-paid workers and to provide a refundable tax credit to offset child care expenses. Mr. Bush would devote about four times as much to tax cuts, reducing revenues by almost $2 trillion. About 40 percent of that would go to the wealthiest 1 percent of families.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's spending proposals are also designed to help low- and moderate-income families. He wants to spend $340 billion on prescription drugs for Medicare enrollees, with the largest subsidies going to poor families. He proposes to spend $50 billion on preschool programs for needy families and about $100 billion on health coverage for uninsured children. The design of these programs largely avoids election-year handouts to well-off voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has criticized Mr. Gore for outspending the projected surplus. True, Mr. Gore's proposals to subsidize drugs and retirement savings are likely to cost far more than he concedes. But the better way for Mr. Bush to press the economic policy debate is to publish an equally detailed plan instead of asking the public to depend on reassurances from economists in his own ideological camp.</p>
