        <p>Researchers in Holland are questioning the safety of a practice that has been widely endorsed by cancer experts in the United States: prescribing the drug tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer in healthy women  who are at high risk for the disease.</p>
        <p>Tamoxifen is the world's most widely prescribed breast-cancer drug. The new doubts about it are based on a study of more than 1,000 women, reported today in the medical publication The Lancet, showing that women who took tamoxifen for two years or more had a greater risk than previously reported of dying from endometrial cancer, which affects the lining of the uterus.</p>
        <p>American researchers questioned the findings, which do not match  results in this country.</p>
        <p>But the Dutch and American scientists did agree on one point: tamoxifen is used to treat breast cancer as well as prevent it, and women who have already had breast cancer, and who are taking tamoxifen to prevent a recurrence, should not stop. In those women, breast cancer is a far greater threat than endometrial cancer, and tamoxifen has been proved to save lives.</p>
        <p>''No breast cancer patient should stop tamoxifen because of this paper,'' said Dr. Flora E. van Leeuwen, an author of the study and a professor of cancer epidemiology at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. ''It's very important.''</p>
        <p>But cancer experts from Holland and the United States disagree on whether healthy women at high risk for breast cancer should take tamoxifen for prevention.</p>
        <p>Tamoxifen has been used to treat breast cancer in the United States since 1977. In 1998 it was proved to prevent the disease as well in a study that was the first to show that any drug could reduce the risk of breast cancer, and women at high risk were urged to consult doctors about whether they should take it. The Food and Drug Administration has approved tamoxifen as a preventive for high-risk women. It is not known how many women are taking the drug for that reason.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lawrence Wickerham, associate chairman of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, which has conducted extensive studies of tamoxifen in North America, said that the Dutch findings should stimulate further research but should not influence medical practice now.</p>
        <p>He and other researchers said that the type of study the Dutch team did, looking back at what patients did in the past, was not as convincing as a study in which patients are divided into groups, given different treatments and the results compared.</p>
        <p>Tamoxifen inhibits the growth of breast tumors by blocking the hormone estrogen, which can stimulate cell growth. Women are generally advised to take it for five years.</p>
        <p>But in the lining of the uterus, tamoxifen can speed up cell growth. Researchers have known since 1988 that the drug could increase the risk of endometrial cancer in postmenopausal women. But studies in the United States, including the 1998 prevention study, showed the endometrial tumors to be uncommon, easy to diagnose early and highly curable. The main symptom is abnormal vaginal bleeding, and women who experience it while taking tamoxifen are warned to see a doctor immediately.</p>
        <p>American studies showed that in 1,000 women over 60 who did not take tamoxifen, there would be one case of endometrial cancer per year. In those who did take the drug, there would be two cases. The risk was considered acceptable when compared with the benefits of the drug.</p>
        <p>The new study, however, found that some endometrial cancers in breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen for more than two years were more advanced and aggressive, and therefore more likely to be fatal, than those found in previous studies.</p>
        <p>The study included 309 women who had breast cancer and later developed endometrial cancer from 1972 to 1996, and 860 control patients who had breast cancer but not endometrial cancer. Of the 309 with endometrial cancer, 108 had taken tamoxifen, as had 245 control patients.</p>
        <p>Twenty-one of the patients with endometrial cancer died of it, including 11 who had taken tamoxifen. The researchers found 17 percent of the women with endometrial cancer who had taken tamoxifen for two years or more had advanced cancers, compared with only 5 percent of those who never took the drug. Tamoxifen users were also more likely to have more aggressive types of tumors than nonusers, and their three-year survival was worse.</p>
        <p>Assuming 20 cases of endometrial cancer over a 10-year period in 1,000 women who took tamoxifen for five years, the researchers estimated that 3 to 5 cases would be of the more dangerous types.</p>
