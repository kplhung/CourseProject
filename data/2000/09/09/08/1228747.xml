        <p>Elvera Sanchez Davis, a tap dancer and the mother of Sammy Davis Jr., died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.</p>
        <p>Known as Baby Sanchez, Ms. Davis began performing at 16 in the chorus line at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem and continued her career into the early 1940's, dancing for six years in the chorus line at the Apollo.</p>
        <p>In 1923, performing in a touring show called ''Holiday in Dixie,'' Ms. Davis met and married Sammy Davis Sr., also a dancer in the show. Their son, born in 1925, often traveled with his touring parents as a child. ''I don't mind him watching from the wings, but I don't want him stealing all my steps,'' John Bubbles said of Sammy, then 2, to Ms. Davis.</p>
        <p>The boy became a tap-dance prodigy by the age of 10, trained and brought up by his father after his parents separated. But he was ''Baby Sanchez's son,'' said the dance historian Delilah Jackson, when he first appeared at the Apollo Theater.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davis decided to retire when the Apollo disbanded its dance chorus, though she danced informally into her 90's. She also performed in touring revues and in films including Carl Micheaux's 1936 ''Swing.''</p>
        <p>After retiring from the stage, she worked as a waitress and became something of a house celebrity at Gracie's Little Belmonte, a popular bar on Kentucky Avenue, a street of glittering black clubs in Atlantic City. Telling jokes and carrying a special gold napkin, Ms. Davis was often visited at her station by star performers like Count Basie when they finished their acts.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davis continued to be involved with New York tap dance until her death, serving from 1989 as an adviser to the New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day.</p>
        <p>She is survived by a daughter, Ramona, of Manhattan.</p>
