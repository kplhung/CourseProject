        <p>For some reason, when Tiger Woods has traveled north to Canada, his performance has headed south.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, Woods missed the cut at the Bell Canadian Open, the only time in 86 career starts on the PGA Tour as a professional that Woods has missed a cut. Today, Woods returned to the Canadian Open for the first time since 1997, trying to accomplish a rare triple crown. Lee Trevino is the only player to win the United States Open, the British Open and the Canadian Open in the same year (1971), and after waltzing to victories at both the United States and British Opens, Woods arrived in the suburbs of Toronto this week hoping to add even more luster to his history-making season.</p>
        <p>But after today's opening round at Glen Abbey Golf Club, winning the Canadian Open will be no easy task for the world's No. 1 player. Spraying shots all over the back nine, and making a costly double-bogey at No. 11, Woods finished at even par 72, tied for 45th place, seven strokes off the lead, and well off his game.</p>
        <p>Kevin Sutherland, who has never won on tour, was the surprise first-round leader, shooting a 65. Cameron Beckman (66) was alone in second place, while Sergio Garcia, J. L. Lewis, Jesper Parnevik and Brian Watts were tied for third place at 67.</p>
        <p>Does Woods still have plenty of time to come back? Of course he does. Would he have to play much better to win? Of course he would.</p>
        <p>''It was kind of ugly,'' Woods said, describing his play over the final 10 holes. ''I hit it left, I hit it right, I hit it short, I hit it long, I hit a lot of bunkers. Golf is a fickle game. It was just one of those days.''</p>
        <p>Woods coughed occasionally as he spoke, still feeling lingering symptoms from a flu he caught last month. Many were surprised that Woods played this week, instead of taking more time off. After this week, Woods will not play again until the Presidents Cup in mid-October.</p>
        <p>''I've taken antibiotics, but I haven't had enough time to get it totally out of my system,'' Woods said of the flu. ''If I don't play this week, I'd take seven weeks off in a row. That's way too long. Five weeks in a row is all right.''</p>
        <p>Woods started well, reaching three under par through eight holes, but then things fell apart. He made a three-putt bogey at No. 9, missing badly from just 3 feet away on his putt for par. Then at the par-4 No. 11, Woods pulled his tee shot left into deep rough, leaving himself with a difficult approach shot, over a tree and over water, just to reach the green. Woods could not pull it off. The ball sailed high over the tree, but it dropped well short of the green and into the water. After a drop and a penalty stroke, Woods hit his fourth shot onto the green, but it landed 15 feet past the cup. Woods missed his putt attempt for bogey, and the double-bogey dropped him to even par. Woods made another bogey at No. 14, but he birdied the final hole, and barely extended his streak of consecutive rounds of par or better to 32.</p>
        <p>Yet, even struggling, Woods remained the focal point of the tournament, and the Toronto area has gone wild for him. When Woods confirmed last week that he would play, the remaining tickets sold out within hours. And today, many in his huge gallery yelled, ''Thanks for coming, Tiger,'' as he walked by, treatment that Woods clearly appreciated.</p>
        <p>''I've heard people scream a lot of other things before, especially after they've had their favorite beverage,'' said Woods smiling. ''This was nice. That's one reason why I've always enjoyed playing in Canada.</p>
        <p>''The people are friendly,'' he said. ''I'm still not out of the tournament. I have an early tee time, hopefully the wind won't blow, and I can get back in it.''</p>
        <p>But Woods will have to catch Sutherland, who birdied six of his first nine holes during a splendid round. Meanwhile, Garcia continued to play well, bolstered by his recent performance at the Battle of Bighorn, the made-for-television match against Woods, won by Garcia, 1-up.</p>
        <p>''To be able to beat Tiger was probably the best thing that could happen to me,'' Garcia said. ''It gave me a lot of confidence, of course. Hopefully, I'll be able to continue playing well this week.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Among other notables, JUSTIN LEONARD and DAVIS LOVE III were at four under par; MARK CALCAVECCHIA was at two under; LEE JANZEN, MARK O'MEARA, CRAIG STADLER and JEFF SLUMAN were at one under; HAL SUTTON shot even par; and PAUL AZINGER was at one over par.</p>
