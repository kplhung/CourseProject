        <p>Judge Wililam Alsum rules in San Francisco that federal officials may not interfere with freedom of California doctors and patients to discuss potential medical benefits of marijuana, or of doctors to recommend its therapeutic use under terms of ballot initiative approved in 1996 (S)</p>

        <p>A federal judge in San Francisco ruled today that federal officials may not interfere with the freedom of California doctors and patients to discuss the potential medical benefits of marijuana, or of doctors to recommend its therapeutic use, under the terms of a state ballot initiative approved by voters in 1996.</p>
        <p>The ruling by Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court came in a class-action lawsuit filed against top Clinton administration officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno, in 1997, seeking to block them from prosecuting or removing the prescription licenses of any doctors who endorsed marijuana's potential benefits in treating patients with painful illnesses like AIDS and cancer.</p>

        <p>A federal judge in San Francisco ruled today that federal officials may not interfere with the freedom of California doctors and patients to discuss the potential medical benefits of marijuana, or of doctors to recommend its therapeutic use, under the terms of a state ballot initiative approved by voters in 1996.</p>
        <p>The ruling by Judge William Alsup of Federal District Court came in a class-action lawsuit filed against top Clinton administration officials, including Attorney General Janet Reno, in 1997, seeking to block them from prosecuting or removing the prescription licenses of any doctors who endorsed marijuana's potential benefits in treating patients with painful illnesses like AIDS and cancer.</p>
        <p>''The relevant federal statute does not authorize the government to revoke a physician's license to dispense controlled substances merely because a physician 'recommends' marijuana as a therapy to a patient,'' Judge Alsup wrote.</p>
        <p>''Any contrary holding would raise severe First Amendment doubts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Similar measures on marijuana use have been passed in Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.</p>
        <p>The California ballot measure, like the one in Arizona, did not remove the longstanding federal prohibition against doctors' prescribing drugs like marijuana and heroin, in which the government recognizes no medical value.</p>
        <p>It simply gave patients found with small amounts of marijuana a defense if they could show that a doctor had recommended it orally or in writing. But almost since the measure's passage, doctors have been fearful of the threat of federal sanctions.</p>
        <p>''This finally signals that doctors and patients can once again openly discuss marijuana as medicine without fear of draconian federal punishment,'' said Graham Boyd, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who filed the case.</p>
        <p>Robert Weiner, a spokesman for retired Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug czar who was also a named defendant in the case, said that his office had just learned of the decision and that with the Justice Department, the main agency handling the case, ''we will study and analyze the decision closely, and that's all I can tell you right now.''</p>
        <p>The government can appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco.</p>
