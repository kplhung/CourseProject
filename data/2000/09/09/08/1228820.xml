        <p>The shuffleboard players here at the John T. Booth Senior Center all have a horror story or two about how they, a friend or a relative has been saddled with crushing prescription drug costs. And so they are thrilled that the issue has moved center stage in the presidential contest between Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>They did not claim to understand the details of the two candidates' competing plans to create prescription drug policies through the Medicare system. But on one issue they were in complete, clear agreement: they did not want the system significantly changed. Expand it, make it more generous, but do not overhaul it, they all said.</p>
        <p>''If they change it, they'll just foul it all up,'' said Helen Mirabile, 80, a retired sewing machine operator, as her friends nodded in assent.</p>
        <p>If there was one political lesson to be gleaned from a 90-minute conversation this morning with 15 retirees in this working-class neighborhood of modest row houses, it might be this: Mr. Bush could have trouble selling his plan for redesigning the Medicare system among the very people who depend on the system now.</p>
        <p>In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Bush called for retooling the 35-year-old system to encourage the use of private insurance plans, some of which would provide prescription drug coverage. By breeding competition among private insurers for the Medicare market, Mr. Bush contends, costs will be lowered and elderly people will have more choices. To help people with drug costs, he proposed subsidizing the premiums of the low-income elderly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also vowed to modernize what he called a ''rigid and sluggish and slow to change'' Medicare bureaucracy that he said increasingly poses ''a hazard to your health.''</p>
        <p>But among the elderly gathered here today, nary a bad word about Medicare could be heard. A few people recalled a bureaucratic error here or there. Others bemoaned cuts in services or rising premiums. But all praised the system for providing services they said they could never have afforded on their own.</p>
        <p>''For me, Medicare has been a godsend,'' said Florence Barnes, 81, a former city employee.</p>
        <p>To be sure, Mr. Bush's proposal for prescription drugs sounded appealing to members of the group, even though most of them already have supplementary insurance plans that cover most of their prescription drug costs. But his attacks on the bureaucracy did not resonate with them. Only one woman could offer a complaint: she had been improperly billed for an X-ray. But after several phone calls, the matter was worked out to her satisfaction.</p>
        <p>And most of them found his proposal to increase the role of private insurance companies troubling. Though only a few of them are enrolled in health maintenance organizations through Medicare, almost all of them had viscerally negative reactions to the idea of managed care.</p>
        <p>(While Mr. Bush's proposal would make participation in private health plans voluntary, its goal would be to encourage more people to join H.M.O.'s, which now cover 6.2 million, or 16 percent, of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries.)</p>
        <p>Rose D'Ambrosio, an 86-year-old retired federal employee, offered the kind of story that many people in the room said they had heard before. Her daughter's H.M.O., she said, took several months to approve major treatment for cancer, creating all kinds of anxieties for the family.</p>
        <p>''She needs more operations,'' Ms. D'Ambrosio said. ''They have to refer you to a doctor. And it takes a long time. A person who has these types of decisions needs care right now, not six months from now.''</p>
        <p>Several other people said they did not like the idea that managed care companies could tell them to use different doctors.</p>
        <p>''I have not only a regular internist,'' said Syd Goldfield, 71, ''I have a urologist. I have a bone doctor. I have an eye doctor. Etc., etc. I know who I am seeing, and I like them. And I don't like to have a strange doctor working on me for anything.''</p>
        <p>Evelyn Hemmeter, 71, said, ''Some people have the same doctors for like 15, 20, 30 years and they aren't going to switch and go to another doctor after they've been with that doctor for that many years.'' Several people also questioned whether Mr. Bush's plan for greater competition was realistic, noting that several H.M.O.'s, some in the Baltimore area, have pulled out of the Medicare system in recent years, citing low reimbursement rates from the government.</p>
        <p>The group, most of whom said they were Democrats, seemed more comfortable with Mr. Gore's plan, though it would cost more than Mr. Bush's: $253 billion over 10 years compared with $198 billion.</p>
        <p>That plan would create a voluntary prescription drug benefit inside the traditional Medicare program. Beneficiaries would pay monthly premiums, but like Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore would subsidize coverage for the low-income elderly. Unlike Mr. Bush, the vice president would offer a uniform, standardized package with the same premiums for most beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>To many people in the group, having more choices among health plans was not their major concern; reliability was. And to them, a system run by the government  rather than by private managed care companies seemed like the better alternative.</p>
        <p>''If you want the best, you have to pay,'' said Ms. Hemmeter, referring to Mr. Gore's more expensive plan. ''And I want the best.''</p>
        <p>The group praised both candidates for focusing on high prescription drug costs. All knew people who have struggled to get by without prescription drug coverage.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hemmeter, for example, said her sister's insurance plan did not cover the cost of drugs to control her cholesterol and blood pressure, which run about $170 a month. Consequently, she said, her sister takes only half the prescribed dosages.</p>
        <p>Several people in the group said Mr. Gore's populist attacks on ''big drug companies'' struck a chord with them.</p>
        <p>''Other countries have price controls and get their drugs cheaper,'' said Eulalia Pereira, 76, a retired federal employee. ''We should too.''</p>
        <p>Maggie Melton, 71, a retired nurse, said she often saw patients who were ill because they could not afford prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>''There are low-income families who have to make a decision about whether they are going to eat or buy medication,'' she said. ''That's really sad. There should be some kind of prescription plan.''</p>
