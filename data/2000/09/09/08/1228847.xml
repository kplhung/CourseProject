        <p>Monster.com, the job-search Web site operated by TMP Worldwide, ended a two-year relationship with Mullen in Wenham, Mass. -- the agency that created a popular 1999 Super Bowl commercial featuring youngsters complaining about dead-end jobs -- by naming Arnold Communications in Boston to handle its American account.</p>

        <p>Monster.com, the job-search Web site operated by TMP Worldwide, ended a two-year relationship with Mullen in Wenham, Mass. -- the agency that created a popular 1999 Super Bowl commercial featuring youngsters complaining about dead-end jobs -- by naming Arnold Communications in Boston to handle its American account.</p>
        <p>Billings were estimated at $75 million to $90 million.</p>
        <p>Melanie Downey, a spokeswoman at Monster.com in Maynard, Mass., said the decision came after a two-month review that had been narrowed to Arnold, Mullen and two other finalists: the New York office of BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group; and Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. Arnold is part of Snyder Communications, soon to be owned by Havas Advertising.</p>
        <p>While the 1999 spot, called ''When I Grow Up,'' proved successful, helping Monster.com achieve high visibility in a crowded dot-com category, a commercial that Mullen created for the 2000 Super Bowl met with a less favorable response and was replaced by other work.</p>
        <p>Mullen, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, partly offset the loss when it was named agency of record for the consolidated account of Fortune and FSB: Fortune Small Business magazines, published by the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc. in New York.</p>
        <p>Fortune had been handled for three years by Fallon New York, part of the Fallon Worldwide unit of the Publicis Groupe S.A. Mullen has handled FSB: Fortune Small Business since September 1999. Total spending for both publications was estimated at $4 million.</p>
