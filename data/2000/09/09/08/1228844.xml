        <p>National Semiconductor reported fiscal first-quarter earnings yesterday that handily exceeded analysts' estimates. For the quarter ended Aug. 27, National had earnings of $144.2 million, or 74 cents a diluted share, more than tripling the $47.1 million, or 25 cents a share, it reported in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 33 percent, to $640.8 million. Excluding one-time items, National had earnings of $149.4 million, or 76 cents a diluted share. Analysts had expected the company to earn 65 cents a share on the same basis. Its shares rose $2.13, to $47.13. National's strong results partly reflect its exit last year from the personal computer microprocessor business, but they also reflect the large portion of revenue that comes from analog semiconductors, which are used in cellular telephones and other hand-held devices.</p>
