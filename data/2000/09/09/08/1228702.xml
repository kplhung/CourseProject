        <p>On Jury Duty</p>
        <p>Jury duty -- in Manhattan, at least -- can be a restaurant lover's dream. The lunch selection in Chinatown, Little Italy and TriBeCa is wonderful. These 12 venues make a case for first-rate dining. Other suggestions are on the Web site of the Citizens Jury Project: www.juryproject.org. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. City Hall</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 227-7777</p>
        <p>131 Duane Street</p>
        <p>TriBeCa</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This TriBeCa restaurant is a versatile lunch spot. You can eat a satisfying meal quickly -- you can't go wrong with oysters on the half shell or the excellent pan roasts -- or you can have something more elaborate, perhaps if you're celebrating the end of jury duty. Fish are another top choice. Henry Meer, the chef and owner, gets a couple of kinds each day and grills them whole. They are invariably fresh and sweet; if you have never tasted lightly charred pompano, City Hall is the place to do it.</p>

        <p>2. Da Nico</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 343-1212</p>
        <p>164 Mulberry Street</p>
        <p>Little Italy</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>At the end of a handsome polished counter displaying marinating vegetables sit a tall brick oven and next to it a rotisserie. Many excellent dishes emerge from the oven, including superb pizzas with their light, thin and crisp crusts that are blackened on the bottom and billowy on top. The quattro stagioni pizza is a wonderful appetizer for two or more, made with marinated fresh artichoke hearts, prosciutto, intense roasted peppers and earthy mushrooms. The pizza margherita is beautifully simple, just tomatoes and mozzarella spiced with basil. Other Da Nico attractions include the generous order of tender baked clams and main courses from the rotisserie, like the moist chicken, crisp on the outside and flavored with rosemary.</p>
        <p>3. Evergreen Shanghai Restaurant</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 571-3339</p>
        <p>63 Mott Street</p>
        <p>Chinatown</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>Shanghai cuisine is renowned for its cold snacks, and Evergreen's selection is terrific. Raw crabs with soy flavor are known as drunken crabs because they are simply marinated in rice wine. Evergreen's version of this signature dish is fabulous, the flesh turned deliciously soft by the wine, tasting of ginger and garlic. Aromatic beef, a version of barbecued brisket, is sliced thin and full of flavor, while spicy cabbage is a sweet yet peppery treat. Main courses include light and fresh bean curd, served with an extraordinary crab meat sauce, and yellowfish served two ways, wrapped in seaweed and lightly fried until just crisp, and encased in thicker, deep-fried bean curd wrappers.</p>
        <p>4. The Independent</p>
        <p>* [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 219-2010</p>
        <p>179 West Broadway, at Leonard Street</p>
        <p>TriBeCa</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>A perfect New York bistro: intimate, casual, beautifully lighted and full of people who look as if they might be famous. The menu offers a wide range of flavors: caviar for high rollers, steak for big eaters and a vegetarian plate. Roast chicken is always satisfying, steak is fine and so is the mixed green salad. House-smoked pork ribs are surprisingly good. An excellent hamburger is served at lunch and at the bar at night. The wine list is good and unusual if a little pricey.</p>
        <p>5. Lombardi's</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 941-7994</p>
        <p>32 Spring Street</p>
        <p>Little Italy</p>
        <p>$ Cash or checks only</p>
        <p>The chefs at historic Lombardi's, owned by the family often credited with introducing pizza to New York City, love to show off their pizza oven. If it's not too busy, they will shepherd children to the rear, explain how the oven works and even allow them to toss in a chunk of coal. The oven produces pizzas with crusts that are gloriously thin, crisp yet elastic, blackened and blistered and full of smoky flavor. The restaurant's traditional toppings are fine; adults may want to order one of the delicious clam pies.</p>
        <p>6. New York Noodletown</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 349-0923</p>
        <p>28 1/2 Bowery, near Bayard Street</p>
        <p>Chinatown</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>With its bustle and clatter, its shared tables and its chefs behind steaming caldrons of soup, New York Noodletown is as close as you can get to Hong Kong in Manhattan. The noodle dishes are outstanding, but the enormous menu offers many more alluring choices. Salt-baked crabs are wonderful in soft-shell season (late spring through summer), while the tender, silky house special chicken is another wonder. Often daily specials are the best, like shrimp with black pepper sauce, and pea shoots stir-fried and served while they are still hot and bright. The trick is persuading a waiter to tell you about them.</p>
        <p>7. Nha Trang</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 233-5948</p>
        <p>87 Baxter Street</p>
        <p>Chinatown</p>
        <p>Cash only</p>
        <p>There's nothing fancy at Nha Trang, a plain storefront with typical Chinatown brightness. But Nha Trang was one of the pioneering Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown, and it's still one of the best. Spring rolls are perfectly fried, while steamed ravioli, glistening paper-thin rice noodles wrapped around minced pork and ground mushrooms and served with slices of smooth, mild Vietnamese pork sausage, is another excellent appetizer. Vietnamese rice noodle soups like pho tai, a huge bowl of noodles and tender slices of beef in a coriander-scented broth, are big enough to be an entire meal. Nha Trang has another branch at 148 Centre Street.</p>
        <p>8. Nobu</p>
        <p>*** [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 219-0500</p>
        <p>105 Hudson Street, at Franklin Street</p>
        <p>TriBeCa</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Nobu has a spirit of invention that turns meals into adventures. By incorporating new ingredients into old dishes or retooling tradition, Nobu Matsuhisa has created an entirely new take on Japanese food. Of course, Nobu is far more than a sushi bar. Still, sushi lovers will find that no kitchen in the city turns out a more spectacular plate of raw fish. The best time to discover this is at lunchtime, when the airy, modern room is far less frantic and you can almost always snag a seat at the sushi bar. To sample the restaurant's best, let the chef devise a meal just for you.</p>
        <p>9. Ping's Seafood</p>
        <p>** [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 602-9988</p>
        <p>22 Mott Street, at Worth Street</p>
        <p>Chinatown</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Ping's, which opened a little more than three months ago, has a sibling on Queens Boulevard in Elmhurst. The chef and owner, Chung Ping Hui, grew up in Hong Kong and made his reputation cooking at Triple Eight Palace in Chinatown before striking out on his own. Now he has returned from Queens to concentrate on his newest restaurant, and the personal touch shows. The waiters seem quietly pleased at the food they're bringing out, setting dishes on the table to a chorus of oohs and aahs before whisking them aside to be divided into individual portions. Near the door stacked fish tanks offer the menu headliners, a stellar cast that includes but is by no means limited to lobsters, eels, scallops, sea bass and shrimp.</p>
        <p>10. Scalini Fedeli</p>
        <p>* [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 528-0400</p>
        <p>165 Duane Street, at Hudson Street</p>
        <p>TriBeCa</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This restaurant has a lot of old-fashioned grace. The dining room, with its well-spaced tables and conservative country-Italian decor, is as soothing as a massage. Current starters include a pepper-crusted tuna over a fennel and tomato salad with black olive vinaigrette; wild mushroom risotto; and cannellini bean soup with Maine lobster and white truffle oil. The main courses are satisfying, decorous and unassuming.</p>
        <p>11. 69 Mott Street</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 233-5877</p>
        <p>69 Mott Street</p>
        <p>Chinatown</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>The specialty at this informal, classically brusque little restaurant is pork. The roast pig is glorious, served in moist, rich, tender bite-size pieces, slightly salty and nutty, with a thin layer of sweet fat and crisp crackling skin. Soups, available with five kinds of noodles, are also good, as is congee, the porridgelike rice dish. But why fool around? Go for the pork.</p>
        <p>12. Sweet 'n' Tart Cafe</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 334-8088</p>
        <p>76 Mott Street</p>
        <p>Chinatown</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>Sweet 'n' Tart Cafe's specialty is tong shui, a range of sweet tonics intended to benefit specific parts of the body or to balance one's yin and yang. That alone makes this one of the most unusual restaurants in Chinatown. But Sweet 'n' Tart's more typical dishes are terrific as well, like congee with beef, pork and squid. The congees are especially good with wands of fried dough, which are broken into the bowl. Chinese sausage and taro with rice, served in a tall, bamboo steamer, is another wonderful dish, while most dumpling and noodle selections are fresh and lively. The only drawback is that no tong shui is helpful for juror's headache.</p>
