        <p>For such a small town, Annapolis (pop. 33,000) has an astonishing array of personalities.</p>
        <p>To military types and sports fans, Annapolis is the United States Naval Academy. To architecture lovers, it is a charming 18th-century town built on a late 17th-century Baroque street plan. To history buffs, it has been the capital of Maryland for 300 years and was briefly the capital of the United States. To recreational boaters, it is among the premier sailing centers on the Eastern Seaboard, its waterfront thronged with pleasure craft. And to just about anyone, it is a perfect place to savor Maryland's singular contribution to Western civilization, the steamed hard-shelled crab.</p>
        <p>Best of all for weekend visitors, Annapolis's numerous attractions are within a 15-minute walk of one another. Like many tourists, I was drawn to Annapolis by its 18th-century buildings and by the Naval Academy, a fascinating and surprisingly visitor-friendly place. Because Annapolis's Colonial homes and gardens are open longer on Saturdays than on Sundays, I toured them first, then the Naval Academy, ending my visit at the historic State House.</p>
        <p>The most interesting Colonial houses in Annapolis are a product of its ''golden age'' in the 1760's and 1770's, a period whose spirit was neatly captured by Jonathan Boucher, the rector of St. Anne's Church in town at the time.</p>
        <p>''It was the genteelest town in North America, and many of its inhabitants were highly respectable, as to station, fortune and education,'' he later wrote. There was ''hardly a town in England so desirable to live in as Annapolis then was,'' he added. ''It was the seat of government, and the residence of the governor, and all the great officers of state, as well as of the most eminent lawyers, physicians and families of opulence and note.''</p>
        <p>I walked to the intersection of Maryland Avenue and King George Street and was magically transported to Boucher's Annapolis. Before me were two of the grandest mansions of that golden age: the Hammond-Harwood House and the Chase-Lloyd House. Both completed in 1774, they reflect the genius of William Buckland (1734-74), who immigrated to Virginia from England as an indentured servant in 1755 but ultimately became one of the Colonies' most distinguished architects.</p>
        <p>Flawless Proportions</p>
        <p>The Hammond-Harwood House is a classic example of the five-part Anglo-Palladian brick mansion popular in America before the Revolution. Other late Colonial houses may be larger or more ornate, but none, I think, is more perfect. The Maryland Avenue facade of the house exemplifies the qualities of Anglo-Palladianism: balance, elegance, coolness, understatement and, above all, flawless proportions. The exquisite front door, writes G. E. Kidder Smith in his ''Source Book of American Architecture,'' ranks ''as one of the finest in U.S. Georgian architecture.''</p>
        <p>Buckland's manifold gifts are equally evident inside. The rooms of the Hammond-Harwood House are not only flawlessly proportioned, but also, because Buckland had apprenticed in England as a joiner, contain superbly decorated woodwork.</p>
        <p>Before the Revolutionary War, Samuel Chase was a young, ambitious Annapolis lawyer and land speculator. The historian Norman K. Risjord called him ''an ardent patriot'' whose ''political philosophy always seemed to coincide with his own interests.'' Chase later signed the Declaration of Independence and served with great distinction on the Supreme Court, even though he is best known today as the only member ever to be impeached. (He was readily acquitted of the politically motivated charges against him.)</p>
        <p>Chase began building his Annapolis town house in 1769. The towering three-story mansion he planned was intended to proclaim his ascendance from humble origins to Maryland's professional elite.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Chase (but luckily for today's tourists), he soon ran out of money. Remarkably, he married a woman of modest means and sold the unfinished house, then a brick shell, to one of the wealthiest men in Maryland, Edward Lloyd IV. In December 1771, Lloyd contracted with Buckland to complete it.</p>
        <p>The parts of the Chase-Lloyd House designed by Buckland and open to visitors are a stunning progression of essays in Anglo-Palladian design. The Palladian front door opens into a front entrance hall graced by a screen of Ionic columns inspired by one of Palladio's drawings of Roman baths. Beyond the screen is a majestic double-cantilevered stair. An oversize Palladian window looking out on the garden dominates the landing. The stair culminates at the second-floor hall with its finely decorated plaster ceiling and two niches flanking a pedimented door.</p>
        <p>On Prince George Street, one block south of Maryland Avenue, is the William Paca House and Garden. Paca (pronounced PAY-cah) was a contemporary of Chase and, like him, a lawyer and Patriot leader who signed the Declaration of Independence. Unlike Chase, Paca had the good sense to marry one of the wealthiest women in the Colony, Mary Chew. Four days later he  bought a prime double lot in the center of Annapolis, with ample room for a huge house and an expansive garden.</p>
        <p>Paca's house, an imposing five-part brick mansion of 1765 he probably designed himself, is well worth visiting. The principal attraction here, however, is the superb two-acre Paca garden.</p>
        <p>Garden Restoration</p>
        <p>Because of the vicissitudes of time -- the house served for many years as the entry to a large hotel and the garden as a parking lot -- the garden of today is only partly a restoration of Paca's showplace. The upper half is a conjectural formal garden consisting of four parterres: elegant compositions of roses, mixed flowers, hollies and topiaries. The lower half is a reconstruction, based on historical evidence, of the ''natural'' portion of Paca's garden. The sophisticated Paca had combined the French formalism that still dominated garden design in the Colonies with the naturalism then in vogue in England.</p>
        <p>The garden is full of lovely plantings, outbuildings and decorative elements, like the charming summerhouse and a Chinese-style bridge over a pond. Urns copied from the garden of the poet Alexander Pope at Twickenham, near London, are a splendid touch. Pope was one of the great English exponents of naturalism in garden design, and may well have influenced Paca when he wrote:</p>
        <p>To build, to plant, whatever you intend,</p>
        <p>To rear the column, or the arch to bend,</p>
        <p>To swell the terrase, or to sink the Grot;</p>
        <p>In all let Nature never be forgot.</p>
        <p>The Naval Academy</p>
        <p>On Sunday I turned from Annapolis's golden age to the sights, sounds, history and beauty of the Naval Academy. It was founded here in 1845 and has occupied a magnificent site on the Severn River almost uninterruptedly ever since. (During the Civil War it was moved to Newport, R.I., to put it beyond the reach of Secessionists in southern Maryland and Virginia; in 1865 it was nearly relocated to Perth Amboy, N.J..)</p>
        <p>The academy is the undergraduate professional college of the Navy, with a 4,000-member Brigade of Midshipmen. During the academic year midshipmen study at the Annapolis campus, but summers after the first year are spent at sea and in other off-campus training. Upon graduation, each becomes an officer in the Navy or Marine Corps.</p>
        <p>I began my visit at the excellent visitors' center, where I saw an enticing film about the academy and exhibits about its history, the life of midshipmen, and famous graduates. I then strolled into the central part of the academy's campus, the Yard.</p>
        <p>Several of the buildings in the Yard are open to visitors. The most interesting ones, architecturally speaking, are the work of Ernest Flagg (1857-1947), a brilliant, dedicated and protean New York City architect who was (among other things) one of America's greatest practitioners in the Beaux-Arts style.</p>
        <p>Flagg produced many important commissions in Manhattan and elsewhere, including the Scribner bookstore on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets and the Singer Tower on lower Broadway, now demolished but briefly the world's tallest building. His widow said, however, that Flagg considered the Naval Academy to be his most important and prestigious commission.</p>
        <p>Rational and Dramatic</p>
        <p>Beaux-Arts architecture was a turn-of-the-century movement centered on the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, where Flagg was an outstanding student in the 1880's. Flagg's buildings at the Naval Academy, constructed between 1899 and 1908, instantly made me a convert. They show in the best light the hallmarks of the Beaux-Arts style: intense rationality, clarity, monumentality, meticulous use of decorative elements, and the dramatic and purposeful ordering of interior spaces.</p>
        <p>The Flagg buildings are in three main groups. The first contains Bancroft Hall (an immense building, repeatedly enlarged, that is still the  academy's only dormitory), Memorial Hall (a majestic pavilion that is reached by the grand entrance and ceremonial stairway of Bancroft Hall) and Dahlgren and MacDonough Halls, which Flagg designed to be the academy's armory and boathouse. Directly across the Yard is what remains of Flagg's academic grouping, the main component of which is Mahan Hall, once the library, with a striking facade and clock tower.</p>
        <p>Flagg's finest building at the academy is the chapel. Based on Jules Hardouin-Mansard's Dome des Invalides in Paris, the burial place of Napoleon, the chapel is a beautiful building inside and out, despite a competent but distorting addition of 1940 by Paul Philippe Cret. (Because of the addition, the best view of the Chapel's exterior is from the intersection of Porter and Buchanan Roads, a hundred feet to the south.)</p>
        <p>The interior of the chapel holds much Tiffany stained glass on historical themes as well as a magnificent dome. In the chapel's crypt are the remains and fascinating memorabilia of John Paul Jones, Revolutionary War hero and ''father of the United States Navy.''</p>
        <p>A Basement, Another Dome</p>
        <p>My last stop at the Naval Academy is a great place for children: the Academy Museum. The main floor offers a wonderful jumble of old photographs, ship paintings, swords, medals and memorabilia of the academy and of early naval heroes as well as a modern exhibition on the Navy's history from the Spanish-American War of 1898 to the present.</p>
        <p>The basement houses the academy's trove of 17th- and 18th-century English wooden ship models, one of the two largest collections in the world. (The other is in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, England.) The models are both precious artifacts and works of breathtaking craftsmanship. One of the most remarkable models in the collection is that of the Grafton, completed in 1679, which may once have belonged to my all-time hero, Samuel Pepys, when he was Secretary to the Admiralty in the 1680's.</p>
        <p>My final destination was Annapolis's most historic structure and best-known landmark, the Maryland State House in State Circle. The oldest part of the building, dating from the 1770's, contains a restoration of the Old Maryland Senate Chamber, which served as the seat of Congress (and hence as the capitol of the United States) from November 1783 to August 1784.</p>
        <p>In this room Gen. George Washington, in a poignant and tearful ceremony, tendered his resignation as commander in chief of the American Army on Dec. 23, 1783. (Ever the showman, George then gleefully scampered off to enjoy Christmas dinner with Martha at Mount Vernon.)</p>
        <p>Three weeks later, Congress ratified the Treaty of Paris here, formally ending the Revolutionary War and making the United States a genuinely independent nation -- though only after the ailing delegate from South Carolina was transported from his sickbed to produce the requisite quorum of 9 (out of 13) states.</p>
        <p>The most obvious and endearing feature of the old State House is the huge white dome constructed in 1785-88 to the plans of the architect Joseph Clark. Said to be the largest wooden dome in the country, this structure has dominated the Annapolis skyline ever since, thanks to two remarkable characteristics.</p>
        <p>First, Clark wildly overreacted to critics who felt that an earlier cupola on the State House roof had been too small to convey the new state's dignity. As an astute observer wrote of Clark's design in 1789, ''There is a disproportion between the dome and the body of the building which must hurt the eye of every spectator.''</p>
        <p>Equally striking, in a random stroke of genius Clark modeled the dome on the Schlossturm, or castle tower, of the palace of Karlsruhe, Germany. How did an epitome of German High Baroque wind up as the crowning feature of Maryland's State House? Clark most likely saw an engraving of the Karlsruhe Schlossturm in the Annapolis book and print shop owned by his brother, Stephen.</p>
        <p>Clark's State House dome was an immediate sensation, both because of its highly distinctive style -- nothing like it ever existed in Britain, for example -- and because of the wonderful views from its observation deck. I stood on the State House grounds, heartily agreeing with the dome's many early admirers, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and Charles Willson Peale among them. After all, why shouldn't the centerpiece of one of our finest Colonial towns, which is still conspicuously grounded on a 300-year-old Baroque town plan, be a German Baroque marvel?</p>
