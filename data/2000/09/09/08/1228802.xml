        <p>Amid Republican concerns that he needs to end the debate over debates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and several of his advisers sent signals today that they were willing to be flexible about the original position that they had outlined and that Vice President Al Gore had rejected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush had been seeking to cast that rejection as a reflection on Mr. Gore's credibility, asserting that the vice president was breaking a promise to debate anytime and anywhere.</p>
        <p>But a few of Mr. Bush's advisers conceded today that Mr. Bush had not made significant inroads with that argument, which the campaign made the centerpiece of a television commercial.</p>
        <p>And the governor hinted that he was ready to break the stalemate, a step that many Republican officials have described as a necessary part of putting his campaign back on a better track.</p>
        <p>''I am confident there will be debates,'' Mr. Bush said in Detroit this morning. ''As to what they look like and where they are, it will be worked out in due course.</p>
        <p>''You cannot run for the presidency without presidential debates.''</p>
        <p>His reference to uncertainty over the details and formats of the debates suggested an inclination to negotiate, as did the later remarks of one of his campaign aides.</p>
        <p>''Everything's on the table,'' the aide said.</p>
        <p>Four days ago, Mr. Bush agreed to just one of three 90-minute debates that were proposed by the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates and guaranteed to be broadcast by all the major networks. Mr. Gore previously agreed to all three.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that he also wanted to do two 60-minute debates sponsored by individual networks, an arrangement that would almost certainly shrink the television audience. He called for the first of those debates to take place next Tuesday, in Washington, on a special weeknight edition of the NBC news program ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>Today, several advisers said that the Bush campaign was considering whether to agree to a second commission debate if Mr. Gore would agree to the 60-minute network debates. The latter would have the kind of less formal setting in which Mr. Bush and his aides feel he shines, the advisers said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's advisers and officials with the debate commission said late today that they had not received any word from the Bush campaign that it was prepared to negotiate along these lines.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said, ''The governor has made no decisions on what he'll do. He's still going to hold Al Gore's feet to the fire.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer was referring to Mr. Bush's plans to travel on Tuesday to Washington for the ''Meet the Press'' debate he has sought. But Mr. Gore has said he will not be there, and NBC has said it will not televise a show without both men.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the campaign, Mr. Gore had said he would debate Mr. Bush on the program, but that was before Mr. Bush had rejected two of the three commission debates. Mr. Gore's current position is that other debates should be added to, not substituted for, the commission's schedule.</p>
        <p>One Bush adviser said the signs that the Bush campaign might move from its original position reflected ''the realization that people didn't buy their debate strategy that Gore was hiding from debates.''</p>
        <p>''It was a ludicrous argument,'' the adviser said.</p>
        <p>But another adviser said Mr. Bush was always prepared to move from his initial position, which reflected his preferences but was largely the opening bid in an inevitable poker game.</p>
