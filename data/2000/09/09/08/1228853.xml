        <p>The playing field was out of sight from where Denny Neagle rested during the ninth inning tonight, in the tunnel behind the visitors' dugout, next to a bathroom. There was a radio broadcast coming from somewhere nearby and this is the way Neagle followed the Yankees' perpetual and decisive rally.</p>
        <p>In the first eight innings, the Yankees failed to score any runs, despite drawing nine walks against the Kansas City starter Dan Reichert. But in the ninth, they came back from a 1-0 deficit by capitalizing on a critical throwing error and crushing three relievers to win, 7-3.</p>
        <p>The Yankees headed for Boston late tonight with a sturdy six-game lead in the American League East.</p>
        <p>Losing this game would probably not have had any practical impact on the Yankees. But coming back to win -- especially after they had blown a ninth-inning lead Wednesday night -- restored some of the confidence they have been building steadily since the All-Star Game break.</p>
        <p>''You want to keep the momentum going, especially with a tough series with Boston coming up,'' said Jose Canseco, who started the Yankees' ninth-inning explosion with a strange at-bat.</p>
        <p>The Yankees (79-58) will play the Red Sox four times in the next four days -- a three-game weekend series in Boston that starts Friday, and a makeup for an early-season rainout at Yankee Stadium on Monday. Roger Clemens will pitch against Boston's Tomo Ohka in the first game, in Clemens's first Fenway Park outing since his disastrous playoff start last fall; Clemens lasted only two innings in Game 3 of the A.L. Championship Series, allowing five runs.</p>
        <p>Exactly half of the 110 pitches that Reichert threw were strikes, a low percentage that usually results in many runs and a rapid exit. But Reichert, who tied Dick Drago's 30-year-old Kansas City record with his nine walks, managed to do just enough to frustrate the Yankees. Many of his walks came with two out, and he surrendered only two hits; the Yankees repeatedly swung over the top of his sinking fastball, beating harmless ground balls.</p>
        <p>Neagle, too, pitched well; the best game he has had with the Yankees, Manager Joe Torre said. Throwing strikes and getting ahead in the count, Neagle retired the first 14 batters he faced before Joe Randa slapped a single in the fifth. He and Reichert were working so quickly that on a couple of occasions, Neagle was late getting out on field to start an inning, rushing out of the clubhouse after changing his T-shirt. ''It felt good, working fast,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the Royals scored a run in the bottom of the eighth, and the Yankees were three outs away from splitting a four-game series they mostly dominated. Unsure whether he would pitch the bottom of the ninth inning, Neagle remained in the tunnel behind the dugout, cooled by air conditioning, somewhat angry that his effort would result in defeat.</p>
        <p>Ricky Bottalico came out of the bullpen to pitch the ninth inning for Kansas City, to face Canseco leading off. Bottalico threw a high fastball that Canseco missed with a swing --  before it struck Canseco in the right biceps. Canseco staggered around a bit, holding his arm, and the game was delayed as he was tended to by a trainer. ''I guess I have a history of doing some strange things,'' said Canseco, who once knocked a fly ball over a fence with his head while playing the outfield.</p>
        <p>Canseco returned to the batter's box, and Bottalico could not throw strikes, walking the slugger. Chuck Knoblauch stepped in as a pinch-runner. Bottalico fell behind Scott Brosius, two balls and no strikes, Brosius anticipated and got a fastball and smacked it into left field. First and second, nobody out. The Yankees' dominoes were aligned.</p>
        <p>Kris Wilson relieved the shaken Bottalico. Luis Polonia pinch-hit, pushed a hard bunt to the third-base side, and Wilson picked up the ball and turned to throw to third for the forceout. Knoblauch was sure he would be cut down.</p>
        <p>Neagle listened to the play on the radio, and suddenly there was a strange sound from the crowd. No cheering. Wilson had hurled the ball down the line, into the corner. Knoblauch scored the tying run, Brosius ran to third as the go-ahead run, and Polonia was at second.</p>
        <p>Jose Vizcaino lined a single through the left side, and the Yankees began piling on, with David Justice eventually capping the outburst with a two-run homer, Neagle rooting them on from a distance.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Yankees signed the veteran major league slugger DAVE NILSSON, who is about to play in the Olympics for Australia, to a contract Aug. 31, with the intention of keeping him for insurance in case they wanted to add him to the postseason roster. As it turned out, the Yankees needed to complete the signing by Aug. 30 to make Nilsson eligible. So although Nilsson in under contract for the Yankees and the team is appealing for his October eligibility, it is highly unlikely that he will play for the Yankees this year.</p>
