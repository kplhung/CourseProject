        <p>Leading Senate Republicans, under pressure from Democrats and some of their own members, changed course today and said they would try to pass legislation in the next few weeks to help low-income elderly people buy prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>Their comments guarantee that senators will soon vote on legislation similar to the competing proposals offered by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>After months of resisting Democratic efforts to offer drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries, Senate Republicans said they would schedule a debate and a vote on the issue, which has reverberated through the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said that Democrats, eager to highlight differences between the parties, would seize every opportunity to force votes on the issue before Congress adjourns next month.</p>
        <p>And Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, said Republicans would try to push through legislation to subsidize state programs that help low-income elderly people buy drugs.</p>
        <p>Votes in the Senate do not mean that anything will become law this year. But they would permit lawmakers to tell constituents they had tried to address one of the most pressing concerns of many voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth, who is in a tight race for re-election, introduced two bills today to provide federal money to the states for prescription drug programs. ''This temporary legislation offers an assurance to low-income seniors that they will be able to receive the help they need while Congress completes the larger task of overhauling the Medicare program,'' Mr. Roth said.</p>
        <p>His proposal resembles a major element of a plan unveiled by Mr. Bush on Tuesday. Mr. Roth described his proposal as an interim measure to provide drug coverage ''outside the Medicare program.''</p>
        <p>Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, has opposed Democratic efforts to call up prescription drug legislation. But he is no longer in a position to stop a debate and a vote.</p>
        <p>John S. Czwartacki, a spokesman for Mr. Lott, said tonight: ''Senator Lott strongly supports the effort to provide seniors in need with prescription drugs now. That's why he is a co-sponsor of the Roth bills. This is the first step in what Governor Bush has outlined as a two-step process. Ultimately, we want to see modernization of Medicare, with reforms to guarantee its long-term solvency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth said his proposal, modeled on the Children's Health Insurance Program, would offer $51 billion to the states over the next four years to assist Medicare beneficiaries with annual incomes up to 75 percent above the poverty level -- up to $14,600 for an individual or $19,700 for a couple.</p>
        <p>At least 22 states already have pharmaceutical assistance programs. Mr. Roth's bill would encourage states to establish or expand them, and the federal government would offer its own program in any state that did not have one.</p>
        <p>About one-third of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, many above the income limits specified in Mr. Roth's bill, do not have insurance for prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>The Roth proposal fleshes out ideas he had been considering before the Republican National Convention, where many speakers declared their commitment to drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Democrats said today that they would test that commitment by forcing votes in the Senate. The votes could occur this way: Democrats offer their proposal as an amendment to some legislation pending on the Senate floor, and Republicans offer their proposal as a substitute.</p>
        <p>''This fight is going to be conducted at every opportunity for the remainder of this session of Congress,'' Mr. Graham said. He is an architect of the Senate Democrats' proposal for Medicare drug benefits, which  resembles the plan developed by Mr. Gore and the Clinton White House over the past 20 months.</p>
        <p>The Senate rejected the Democratic proposal by a vote of 53 to 44 on June 22. Two Republican senators, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Peter G. Fitzgerald of Illinois, voted for it; one Democrat, John B. Breaux of Louisiana, voted against it.</p>
        <p>Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota, chairman of the Senate Democratic Policy Committee, asked today: ''What has changed since the last vote? We now have a stack of speeches delivered in Philadelphia. Let's see whether those who talk about prescription drug benefits are willing to vote for them.''</p>
        <p>''Either there has been a genuine change of heart by Senate Republicans,'' Mr. Dorgan said, ''or the speeches in Philadelphia were not a true reflection of what they really believe.''</p>
        <p>Senate Democrats said elderly people would, in many states, have to go to welfare offices to qualify for pharmaceutical assistance under state programs.</p>
        <p>''Senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth insisted that no stigma would be attached to drug coverage under his bill.</p>
        <p>Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, criticized Mr. Roth's proposal for other reasons. ''It doesn't cover everyone, and it's not fair because the benefits would not be consistent across the country,'' Dr. Shalala said. ''Where you live would determine what benefits you get.''</p>
