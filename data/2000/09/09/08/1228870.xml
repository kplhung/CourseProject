        <p>Tony Shafrazi  119 Wooster Street  SoHo  Through Sept. 16</p>
        <p>In 1988, after careers in ballet and high-profile modeling, Anh Duong took up painting. The self-portraits in this, her second solo exhibition, are not without a certain nerve, but Ms. Duong's work still looks like that of a promising student searching for her own vision.</p>
        <p>On raw, artfully stained canvases ranging from 4 feet square to 8 by 6 feet, Ms. Duong uses thin brushes to draw linear, expressionistic images of herself nude or in sexy lingerie. She appears a gaunt, big-eyed waif, slouching in some pictures with wide open legs exposing detailed genitalia. There is a feeling of melancholic, defiantly jaded, possibly abused eroticism. Moreover, the way the semitransparent figure merges with the Abstract Expressionist background of brown staining and wide-brushed swathes of white paint suggests a mood of existential ennui.</p>
        <p>The paintings want to seem soulful and daring but they feel more self-consciously calculated and cliched. The Egon Schiele-style narcissistic angst and the portentous titles -- ''Syllogisms of Bitterness,'' ''The Awakening of Inner Conflict'' -- are sophomorically heavy-handed. Ms. Duong draws with sensitive facility; less theatricality and more attention to ordinary things might be in order.</p>
