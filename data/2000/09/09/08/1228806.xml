        <p>With President Clinton and other government leaders filling seats usually occupied by their envoys, the Security Council moved today toward a new role for itself in a world where the rules have been rewritten by warlords, and the poor kill the poor over dwindling resources.</p>
        <p>The unusual meeting, with 14 heads of government and a foreign minister gathered around the Council table, was intended to concentrate on peacekeeping problems, with a special emphasis on Africa.</p>
        <p>But it very quickly turned to a far broader discussion about the causes of war in an age when ethnic cleansing, rape and mutilation have become the tactical hallmarks of pickup armies that terrorize populations often already weakened by poverty or disease. The issue was raised most prominently a year ago by Secretary General Kofi Annan, and was addressed vigorously today.</p>
        <p>''Timing makes a big difference in the type of debate we will have today versus what it might have been 15, 20, 30 years ago,'' said Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.</p>
        <p>He told the Council that peacekeeping was often all that stood ''between anarchy and some form of stability.'' Sierra Leone, where Britain has sent hundreds of peacekeepers, was an example, he added.</p>
        <p>''Whether it is poverty or debt or aid and development, or infectious diseases or governance and the rule of law, we need a far broader concept of how we deal with these security issues for today's world,'' Mr. Blair said. ''We cannot isolate conflict from the root causes of it.''</p>
        <p>But as the Council moved into new territory, other leaders addressing the summit meeting in the General Assembly kept to familiar attacks against the deep disparities between rich and poor nations. They demanded that the industrialized world offer more tangible aid to countries that have been left behind.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Annan and Mr. Blair, Mr. Clinton argued that peacekeeping meant thinking not only about weapons but also about water, schools, health and the environment.</p>
        <p>''Some people will listen to this discussion and say, well, peacekeeping has something to do with security, but these other issues don't have anything to do with security and don't belong in the Security Council,'' he said. ''This is my last meeting -- I just have to say I respectfully disagree. These issues will be more and more in the Security Council. Until we confront the iron link between deprivation, disease and war, we will never be able to create the peace that the founders of the United Nations dreamed of.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton soon discovered he was not alone. Except for President Jiang Zemin of China, who argued stonily for the most restrictive definition of the Security Council's role, and Vladimir V. Putin, who in an unspoken reference to NATO was more preoccupied with opposing the use of force outside the Council's control, a significant number of national leaders echoed Mr. Clinton's call.</p>
        <p>China and sometimes Russia argue that social issues should be left to the Economic and Social Council, which was established by the United Nations Charter to be a parallel body to the Security Council. It was given wide authority in social issues, including human rights and crime.</p>
        <p>But Ecosoc, as it is known, has proved unwieldy with 54 members, ineffective and rarely innovative, despite the considerable efforts of American and European diplomats to reform it and give it greater authority.</p>
        <p>Today, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh and President Jacques Chirac of France spoke at the Council of large-scale human rights abuses and disasters of other kinds affecting large numbers of vulnerable people.</p>
        <p>It was talk like this that moved the Council to its first high-level debate on the thorny subject of when it has the right to intervene to save citizens, even if that means intruding on national sovereignty.</p>
        <p>And at the end of the discussion, despite the lingering differences of opinion, the leaders unanimously adopted a resolution that called for, among other things, the development within the United Nations of ''comprehensive and integrated strategies to address the root causes of conflicts, including their economic and social dimensions.''</p>
        <p>In the last year, since Secretary General Annan first raised this issue in the General Assembly, it has been the fodder of academic and policymaking debate. Today, Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada told the Council -- meeting at head-of-state level for the first time since 1992 -- that it could not back away from the debate.</p>
        <p>''Because if the Security Council is unable to adapt,'' Mr. Chretien said, ''it will seriously undermine its credibility as a guarantor of peace, credibility that is essential to maintaining the moral authority of the U.N. as a whole.''</p>
        <p>Later, in a speech in the General Assembly, Mr. Chretien announced that Canada would establish an international panel of legal and political experts to study the issue of military intervention on humanitarian grounds, taking a major step toward making the discussion more concrete.</p>
        <p>The credibility factor lurked behind much of what was said about peacekeeping and how the United Nations has been stumbling disastrously in trying to meet new challenges.</p>
        <p>In opening the Council session, Mr. Annan laid bare the background against which United Nations peacekeeping has to work when he said, ''Many in the present generation are losing confidence in the ability of the United Nations to make the difference between war and peace.'' This week's withdrawal of United Nations refugee workers from West Timor gave weight to his remarks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan, a former head of peacekeeping who moved into the top job just as the United Nations was floundering over its role in the post-cold-war era, has ordered reviews of peacekeeping debacles in Rwanda and Bosnia and of the overall functioning of the department. The results have been very critical not only of the organization but also of its leading members, especially the United States.</p>
        <p>''Too many vulnerable communities in too many regions of the world now hesitate to look to the United Nations to assist them in their hour of need,'' Mr. Annan said today. ''No amount of resolutions or statements can change this reality. Only action can -- prompt, united and effective action, pursued with skill and discipline to halt the conflict and restore the peace. Only such determined action can restore the reputation of the United Nations as a credible force for peace and justice.''</p>
        <p>The United Nations peacekeeping department has 32 officers to provide military planning and guidance for 27,000 troops. An additional 8,600 civilian police officers are supervised by only nine police experts in New York. There are 15 political desk officers looking after 16 operations. Only 1.25 percent of the peacekeeping budget goes to headquarters administration, far too little, experts say, to allow for adequate planning.</p>
        <p>The Security Council itself -- or at least its leading members -- are often the problem, said Lakhdar Brahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister who was chairman of the expert panel that studied overall United Nations peacekeeping and issued a critical report last month.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Brahimi said interference from powerful nations in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations -- known in the parlance by the letters D.P.K.O. -- should stop.</p>
        <p>''The big boys on the Security Council come through the back door and tell the D.P.K.O. and all of us here: 'Don't say this; don't say that. Don't ask for this, don't ask for that,' '' he said. ''They really influence us into self-censorship.''</p>
        <p>The Council's resolution today addressed some of Mr. Brahimi's concerns by speaking of better training and equipment for peacekeepers, a restructuring of the peacekeeping department and a search for new ways to finance the troops.</p>
