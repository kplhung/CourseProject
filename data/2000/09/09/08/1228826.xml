        <p>Gov. George W. Bush today dismissed criticism from some Republicans over the direction of his campaign. But he also called himself the underdog in the race and said he would restyle his campaign to include more intimate gatherings with voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush and his aides said he would start appearing at town hall meetings again as early as next week. Such sessions disappeared in March after Senator John McCain dropped from the Republican race.</p>
        <p>Karen P. Hughes, Mr. Bush's communications director, said the Texas governor was also likely to start dropping into coffee shops and cafeterias and might begin to visit families to discuss how his tax cut plan would affect them.</p>
        <p>Asked why he wanted to hold such events, Mr. Bush said, ''Well, it's a  better picture.'' He said that if his unscripted encounters were mostly with reporters on his campaign plane, ''people don't get a sense of  my ability to relate to people. They don't get a sense that my plan has got real purposes for real people.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes repeatedly used a similar phrase, ''real plans for real people,'' making it clear that this was the Bush campaign's new slogan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made his comments at an impromptu news conference on an airport tarmac in Detroit after prominent Republicans across the country expressed concern over the state of his campaign and after a series of national and state polls showed that Vice President Al Gore was solidifying the gains he had made after the Democratic National Convention.</p>
        <p>A poll released today by ABC News and The Washington Post found the race tied, with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore each attracting 47 percent. A Gallup Organization poll for CNN and USA Today found Mr. Gore leading Mr. Bush, 47 percent to 44 percent, a result that is also essentially a tie, since it is within the margin of error.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush said today that he would change some campaign events, he also waved off some of the second-guessing. ''That's Washington,'' he said. ''That's people getting ready to jump out of the foxhole before the first shell is fired.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush used the military analogy on a day when he campaigned with two of the most prominent figures of his father's administration, Colin L. Powell, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and J. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded United States troops during the Persian Gulf war of 1991.</p>
        <p>Both voiced support for Mr. Bush's contention that President Clinton had allowed the military to deteriorate, leaving it unprepared for post-cold-war conflicts. And Mr. Powell called Mr. Bush ''a man with a mission, a man with vision, a man who is committed to making sure the armed forces of the United States will always be the best.''</p>
        <p>Many of the Republicans who had voiced concerns about the shape of the Bush campaign seemed particularly concerned about Mr. Bush's refusal to agree to debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. They said his stance had made him seem timid and had taken him into an unproductive fight over political process rather than issues.</p>
        <p>While he continued to criticize Mr. Gore for rejecting his offer for a different set of debates -- two of them shorter and to more limited audiences than the commission debates -- Mr. Bush for the first time gave some suggestion that there was give to his position. ''There will be debates,'' he said. ''I am confident there will be debates. As to what they look like and where they are, it will be worked out in due course.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush even joked that he ''may go more alpha male coming down the stretch.'' That was a dig at Mr. Gore, who had a feminist author on his payroll last year, advising him how to dress and act like an alpha male. ''I'm under no illusions and neither should our supporters be -- it's going to be a tough contest,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Asked if he was the underdog, Mr. Bush jumped at the label. ''Yeah,'' he said. ''I'm the underdog. But I was the underdog when I first started.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's new campaign style is reminiscent of the retooling of his primary campaign in South Carolina in February after his drubbing by Mr. McCain in New Hampshire. Mr. Bush began holding town meetings, which had been his opponent's trademark. And he tried to appropriate Mr. McCain's reform mantle, calling himself a ''reformer with results.''</p>
        <p>The events Mr. Bush and his aides were describing today, similarly echoed of the style of Mr. Gore, who has been holding town hall meetings, visiting teachers in their homes and stopping into coffee shops to talk to workers. Mr. Gore often talks of fighting for ''working people.'' Mr. Bush is now speaking of working for ''real people.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes said the governor and his aides had thought they were not being ''creative'' enough. She said the campaign had fallen into auto-pilot, simply using the rally formats that had worked so well for the governor on his ride into the Republican National Convention. She said Mr. Bush wanted to put a human face on his policy proposals by meeting with people and showing how they would benefit under his plans.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign derided Mr. Bush's portrayal of himself as an underdog.</p>
        <p>''This is a guy who raised $100 million in this campaign, a record, from the special interests -- the H.M.O's, the prescription drug companies and the big oil industry,'' said Chris Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman. ''It's Al Gore who has an agenda that represents the underdog and George W. Bush who has an agenda that represents the special interests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's new style was not visible today, however, as he turned to military themes and showcased at his side Mr. Powell and Mr. Schwarzkopf. At Wright University here, under a banner proclaiming ''Respecting America's Military,'' Mr. Bush introduced the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Desert Storm commander, and each one gave him a strong endorsement as the best man to be commander in chief.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also hinted at stops across the day that should he be elected, he would name Mr. Powell to his administration. ''The general talked about being retired from public service,'' he said here, then glanced at Mr. Powell and added puckishly, ''If all goes well. . . .'' The crowd erupted in cheers and applause.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush pledged that he would push for modernization of the military to meet the new threats in the world.</p>
        <p>And he said that the nation had the chance to ''redefine how war is fought and won in the future, and therefore we have the opportunity to redefine how the peace is kept.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that if elected, he would assemble a task force of military leaders to come up with a ''strategic plan'' for what the military of the future should look like.</p>
        <p>''We know it's not going to look like the great American moment of Desert Storm and Desert Shield,'' Mr. Bush said. ''A military of the future is not going to be that heavy, and it's not going to be that hard to move.''</p>
        <p>Today's events were designed to put the gulf war leaders at center stage in order to endorse the son of the man they served under. General Schwarzkopf called himself proud to ''stand up and endorse'' Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powell lambasted the Clinton administration for hurting military readiness, a theme that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, who was defense secretary under President Bush, have been hitting hard.</p>
        <p>''I was shocked and frankly deeply disappointed the other day when the president's spokesman attacked Dick Cheney because he dared to tell the truth about the state of readiness, and said he was attacking the military,'' Mr. Powell said. ''Dick Cheney has never attacked the military.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney pressed the same theme in appearances at military contractors in New England. He recalled a telephone call he had made to former President Ronald Reagan after the gulf war, saying he had thanked Mr. Reagan for the money his administration had spent on the military. ''I ask myself,'' he said, ''is anybody going to call Bill Clinton or Al Gore in the future to thank them for what they did to the U.S. military? I don't think so.''</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, challenged several of the assertions Governor Bush made in his speeches today. Mr. Bacon said that the administration, along with Congress, had increased military spending by $150 billion over the next several years. That included an increase in spending on weapons and other equipment -- an area where Mr. Bush was sharply critical -- from $43 billion in 1998 to $60 billion today, as well as three straight years of pay raises.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bacon also noted that the number of troops qualifying for food stamps -- which Mr. Bush has often cited as evidence that the Clinton administration has neglected men and women in uniform -- had declined significantly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bacon said that 19,400 service members, nine-tenths of 1 percent of the total, collected food stamps in 1991, when Mr. Bush's father was president and his running mate, Mr. Cheney, was secretary of defense. Today, Mr. Bacon said, 5,100 are on food stamps, or four-tenths of 1 percent of a smaller force.</p>
