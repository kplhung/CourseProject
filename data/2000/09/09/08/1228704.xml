        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.  ++ means discounted tickets were available at the TKTS booth for last Friday night only.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT'' (Tony winner for best musical, choreography and featured actor and actress). The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly un related vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Deborah Yates and the Tony winners Boyd Gaines and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical, it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form as ''Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all familiar with (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $85 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>*++''COPENHAGEN'' (Tony winner for best play, director and featured actress). Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (the Tony-winning Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65; $25 student rush at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*++ ''KISS ME, KATE'' (Tony winner for best musical revival, director of a musical, musical actor, costumes and orchestration). A mouthwatering revival, with ham as the plat du jour, of Cole Porter's sybarite's delight of a musical about battling egos in show business. As presented by a preening cast led by the wonderful Marin Mazzie and the Tony-winning Brian Stokes Mitchell, who wear a spotlight as if it were a dressing gown and vice versa, this ''Kate'' proves that ham can indeed make a banquet if the spices are zesty enough. Avoiding the attitudes that are anathema to lively revivals of vintage musicals -- reverence and condescension -- the director Michael Blakemore and the choreographer Kathleen Marshall have shaped a show that is broad, brazen and finally irresistible. The production, which doesn't seem to have a thought in its giddy head beyond entertaining us as much as it is entertaining itself, feels like one long ear-to-ear grin (2:20). Beck, 302 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29 to $84 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER.'' This revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's 1939 farce, starring Nathan Lane in a role famously modeled on Alexander Woollcott, feels busy without being lively. Under the direction of Jerry Zaks, the production seems to exist in neither the then nor the now. Much of the acting is a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes without being anchored to character or context. And Mr. Lane, looking like a cuddly, Mattel-made Sigmund Freud doll in his beard and spectacles, never quite comes up with a coherent performance; it's as if he is still experimenting with his options. Tony Walton's richly colored set is a showroom-perfect evocation of period style that fits nicely into the newly restored American Airlines Theater (formerly the Selwyn). But the evening's most authentic glimpses into a vanished era of madcap celebrities are provided by Lewis J. Stadlen, in a character inspired by Harpo Marx, and Byron Jennings, as a charming Noel Cowardesque narcissist. Unfortunately their appearances onstage feel as brief and brilliant as lightning (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $70, half-price for children 18 and under (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*++ ''THE MUSIC MAN.'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of corn-fed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let them show their stuff. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Simon, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>++ ''THE CRUMPLE ZONE.'' This new play by Buddy Thomas is uneven, but it has a lot going for it: a nicely structured plot about a gay household with a love triangle coming to crisis at Christmastime, sequences of physical comedy that are antic without being overblown into slapstick and an effective set that evokes a pleasantly chintzy apartment on Staten Island. Most of all, though, it has a bristling, funny performance by Mario Cantone, who plays the squeaky wheel, a clamorously lonely man on the outside of the triangle looking in. Mr. Cantone is known for his high-pitched stand-up comedy work, and he knows how to take over a room. In this case the room is a tiny apartment, but he works it as a diva would. He is the kind of actor who seems most in control when he's in a tizzy, with a voice that easily and naturally runs up to shrill. But this is not a shrill performance. Even in high dudgeon there's no tension in Mr. Cantone's face or his body language, no sense of Method acting when he's working up to a fever pitch, just the wicked glee of a man who loves to seize the spotlight. The magnitude of his neurotic charisma in such a small space gives his character the hilariously keening pathos that makes the play work (2:00). Rattlestick, 224 Waverly Place, near West 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 206-1515. Mondays, and Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $39 to $45 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>''IT AIN'T NOTHIN' BUT THE BLUES.'' This slick musical revue, a Tony nominee in 1999, has been slimmed down to a supper-club-brisk 80 minutes in its new cabaret home, but its strength remains in its high spirits and the marvelous voices on display. The six performers are the happiest blues singers you'll ever see -- it's thematic that the show begins and ends with ''Let the Good Times Roll'' -- and each brings a full throat and a flawless sense of pitch to standards like ''I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,'' ''I Put a Spell on You'' and ''I Can't Stop Lovin' You'.'' Show-biz values keep things cheerful and the performers on a strict leash, and as a result longtime blues fans may miss the music's mordant spirit, its down and dirty heart. There's a blues-lite feel to the evening that wouldn't suit a roadhouse, but it's perfectly apt here: the blues for the new Times Square (1:20). B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>*+ ''JITNEY.'' ''Don't put your business in the street,'' advises a character in this splendidly acted production of August Wilson's early comic drama about a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh. As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays about the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where private business is always on parade: real life is always the best show in town. ''Jitney,'' which has been extensively revised since its first production in 1982, could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality and is rendered with such stylish detail that a complete urban symphony emerges. There are occasional whiffs of standard-issue melodrama. But under Marion McClinton's sensitive direction, every performer shines as a soloist and as a member of the chorus. It's the finest ensemble work of the season (2:35). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51; $21 student rush (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''SPINNING INTO BUTTER.'' Everyone is talking about race these days. But who's talking to whom, about what and why? Rebecca Gilman's play turns these questions into a tense farce set on a Vermont college campus filled with self-congratulation about its commitment to diversity. Commitment turns to crisis when a black student starts receiving racist letters. Can the administration find the culprit, confront the moral issues and turn a crisis into a public-relations coup? Talk may be cheap, but its consequences are lethal. Hope Davis is excellent as the most emotionally complex of the administrators. Daniel Sullivan's direction is too brash, and Ms. Gilman is struggling with the balance between force and subtlety. The play is worth seeing, though. This is the stuff theater should be spinning, churning and beating into art (2:00). Newhouse, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday and Saturday matinees at 2. Tickets: $55 (Margo Jefferson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>+ ''CATS.'' The first children who saw this show when it opened have graduated from college. So has the phenomenon of ''Cats'' been a force for good in the world? On the one hand the show, with its unequaled longevity and worldwide fame, educated audiences to be palliated by pageantry, special effects and brash sentimentality rather than provoked by well-constructed narrative, musical originality and emotional ambiguity and depth. On the other hand, you'd have to be a real spoilsport not to recognize its welcoming spirit and democratic appeal. How many ticket buyers who would never have entered a theater otherwise were drawn in by the show's notoriety and accidentally discovered what a cool world of possibilities the inside of a theater represents? You can't win the argument either way. You can only say hail and farewell (2:30). Winter Garden, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $75 (Weber).</p>
        <p>Long-Running: Broadway</p>
        <p>Summaries of reviews by Ben Brantley and Peter Marks:</p>
        <p>*+ ''CABARET.'' This wildly popular if at times preachy incarnation of the Kander and Ebb musical is ensconced quite mesmerizingly at Studio 54, where it remains a lurid, deliberately grim presentation of Weimar decadence as a prelude to the Holocaust (2:30). 254 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $90; $25 rush except on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>+ ''MISS SAIGON.'' Age has both mellowed and invigorated this show. The staging is as sure and crisp as ever; for all the jokes about the musical's helicopter, the second-act evacuation scene that deploys it remains a stunner (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $85; $20 student rush at box office.</p>
