        <p>The mob rampage that killed three United Nations workers in the West Timor region of Indonesia on Wednesday seemed to some aid workers like a terrifying flashback: in many respects it replicated the violence, exactly one year ago, in East Timor.</p>
        <p>As survivors described the attack today, they told of narrow escapes from men with guns and machetes who went from house to house, banging on doors and threatening occupants, looking for foreigners to kill.</p>
        <p>''It happened in a split second,'' one survivor, Alias Bin Ahmal, told reporters today. ''A few who made it had a very narrow escape. There was one who was stabbed and beaten. All hell broke loose.''</p>
        <p>The attack took place just across the border from East Timor, which was devastated last year by killings and destruction after it voted for independence from Indonesia.</p>
        <p>The scene was one of several camps that still house more than 100,000 refugees who for the last year have been terrorized by militias that opposed independence and that now have begun to step up cross-border raids into East Timor.</p>
        <p>It offered the latest evidence in an unstable nation that the president, Abdurrahman Wahid, does not have full control of his armed forces, which apparently continue to support the militias they created. Attending the summit meeting at the United Nations, Mr. Wahid acknowledged as much, saying the incident may have been timed to embarrass him.</p>
        <p>It also may have been intended as a warning after a first step by Indonesia to bring to trial some military and police officers who were responsible for the violence in East Timor.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, the attorney general's office identified 19 suspects but came under immediate criticism for omitting top officers, including General Wiranto, who had been the armed forces chief. The United Nations has said that if Indonesia does not deal adequately with those responsible, the organization could open an international tribunal.</p>
        <p>The violence in West Timor comes as East Timor is struggling to rebuild after the violence that took at least 1,000 lives and left some 70 percent of its buildings in ruins.</p>
        <p>The United Nations assistant secretary general, Hedi Annabi, warned a week ago that the escalating attacks could be aimed at destabilizing East Timor as it moves toward elections and full self-government independent of the United Nations. In recent weeks, two international peacekeepers have been killed and several wounded.</p>
        <p>In Indonesia itself, East Timor is a minor issue, receiving minimal government attention. With violence endemic in parts of the country and with its politics in disarray, the problems that confront Mr. Wahid seem to be more than he can manage.</p>
        <p>The killings on Wednesday were carried out by the same militias that devastated East Timor, and it took place, once again, with the apparent involvement of at least some elements of the Indonesian military. As in East Timor, nobody knows at what point the chain of command may have broken down, but it is clear that the militias continue to receive supplies and support from the military.</p>
        <p>Once again, as last year in East Timor, armed Indonesian soldiers and police officers stood by and did nothing. Once again, officials excused the outbreak as an ''emotional reaction'' by ''rogue elements.'' Once again, the government, which has promised for months to bring the situation under control, sought to defuse criticism with a new promise.</p>
        <p>And once again in recent months, as it had last year in East Timor, the government allowed the threats and violence to build in the refugee camps of West Timor in defiance of international pleas and pressure.</p>
        <p>''This would not, could not have happened if Indonesian authorities had taken steps much earlier to disband the militias in West Timor and  prosecute them for known acts of violence,'' said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at the New York-based Human Rights Watch. ''Instead, local civilian and military authorities gave every encouragement to these men and their political front organizations to intimidate East Timorese refugees under their control.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ahmal, a Malaysian who heads the office of the United Nations high commissioner for refugees in Atambua, where the attack took place, said hundreds of armed men stormed the agency's office after the funeral of a militia leader who had been killed by unknown assailants.</p>
        <p>''There was absolutely no attempt to stop these people from coming in,'' he said. ''The few police that I saw stood by. People were armed, some with guns, some with machetes. They were bent on destroying and killing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ahmal said he and five colleagues hid in the home of a local woman for three and a half hours after his office was attacked.</p>
        <p>''She was telling militias who banged on her door that we had tried to come in but went farther down the road,'' he said. ''If it was not for the woman's determination and ingenuity, we would all have been sitting ducks.''</p>
        <p>The United Nations continued today to evacuate its workers from the most dangerous areas of West Timor. They were being moved to East Timor, the territory from which some of them had been evacuated one year ago after similar attacks.</p>
        <p>Sidney Jones, the Asia director for Human Rights Watch, who has spent several months in East Timor, said the militias might be trying, as they did last year, to force foreigners out so they could act with impunity.</p>
        <p>She and others said they appeared to be acting from a mixture of motives. They appear to be hoping to take over the western part of East Timor, and they have demanded a general amnesty. They and their backers in the Indonesian military may also be motivated, as they were in the destruction in East Timor, by simple hatred and revenge.</p>
