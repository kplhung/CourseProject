        <p>''It All Starts Today'' follows a year in the life of Daniel (Philippe Torreton), the director of a preschool in a depressed former coal-mining region of France.

        <p>Filmed with unassuming realism, beautiful to look at even as it refuses any suggestion of stylishness, this latest film from Bertrand Tavernier is a passionate and relentless look at how chronic unemployment -- with the usual side effects of alcoholism, domestic abuse and pervasive despair -- menace the lives of children.

        <p>''It All Starts Today'' follows a year in the life of Daniel (Philippe Torreton), the director of a preschool in a depressed former coal-mining region of France. The son of a miner, Daniel fills his journals with meditations on nature and history that provide, as they are read on the soundtrack, a kind of poetic counterpoint to, and relief from, the misery and deprivation that dominate Daniel's professional life, and much of the movie.</p>
        <p>Filmed with unassuming realism, beautiful to look at even as it refuses any suggestion of stylishness, this latest film from Bertrand Tavernier is a passionate and relentless look at how chronic unemployment -- with the usual side effects of alcoholism, domestic abuse and pervasive despair -- menace the lives of children. In spirit it's a bit like some of Jonathan Kozol's recent books, which celebrate the resilience and innate goodness of children even as they decry the way society has failed to protect them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tavernier takes us into the squalid housing projects in which many of Daniel's students live and records the bureaucratic boilerplate that, in the mouths of well-meaning but self-protective functionaries and politicians, reduces young lives to jargon and statistics. But he also illuminates the warmth and safety of the school, watching Daniel and his colleagues sing songs, tell stories and supervise art projects and playground games.</p>
        <p>In scene after scene ''It All Starts Today'' uncovers the contrast between the world the teachers try to create for their pupils and the world in which these children must grow up. In the course of an ordinary day Daniel must deal with a boy who refuses to talk, parents who can't afford minuscule contributions to the school's activity fund, and a drunken mother who collapses on the playground and then, overcome with shame, runs away, abandoning both her 5-year-old daughter and her infant son to Daniel's care.</p>
        <p>Daniel addresses each crisis the only way he can, by a series of improvised stopgap measures that seem woefully inadequate to address the social catastrophe unfolding around him. He is constantly at loggerheads with the local child welfare office, at one point barring its staff members from the school. The elected officials are no better, alternately complaining of budget constraints and boasting about their accomplishments and initiatives.</p>
        <p>The movie charts both Daniel's frustrations -- his humiliation by an inspector who finds fault with his pedagogical techniques, the trashing of his school by teenage vandals -- and his minor victories. He manages to harangue the authorities into providing legally mandated medical examinations for the children and rescues one young boy from an abusive home. He also tries to live a normal, decent life: to find time for his girlfriend Valeria (Maria Pitaressi), to bond with her suspicious 12-year-old son, Remi (Lambert Marchal), and to help his aging parents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tavernier -- who is still perhaps best known in this country for ''Round Midnight,'' his portrait of the sentimental bond between an African-American jazz musician and an adoring French fan -- has ventured into the kind of politically explicit drama often associated with British filmmakers like Ken Loach and Mike Leigh.</p>
        <p>But on close inspection ''It All Starts Today'' can't be dismissed -- or celebrated -- as a programmatically leftist film. If it takes up traditionally leftist concerns -- the persistence of social inequality, the plight of the poor -- it also implicitly takes account of the European left's defeat. In this film the French working class, once the proud standard-bearer of radical tradition, survives as a demoralized underclass stripped of its historical identity and its vision of the future.</p>
        <p>The mayor who responds to Daniel's plea for more money with a cynical tirade is a member of the Communist Party. Early on, a politician stands in front of a mural of 19th-century strikers and announces that the region must move beyond its claim to fame as the setting of Zola's ''Germinal'' and stake its future on tourism.</p>
        <p>Daniel's class consciousness at times seems downright quaint -- he's the only member of the school staff who belongs to the union -- and the parents of his charges hardly regard him as one of them. When he complains to his own mother about her coffee, her tart reply is, ''That's miner's coffee, not teacher's coffee.''</p>
        <p>In some ways the politics of ''It all Starts Today'' might even be called conservative, since it laments the breakdown of families and communities and the corrosive effects of popular culture on social cohesion and national morale. ''We're in Texas,'' says Samia (Nadia Kaci), the pediatric nurse who becomes Daniel's chief ally, marveling at a classroom full of children named Wendy, Kevin, Clayton and Jimmy. ''No, we're on 'The Young and the Restless,' '' Daniel replies.</p>
        <p>But instead of confecting an ideological soap opera or a feel-good do-gooder melodrama, Mr. Tavernier has pulled off an emotionally rich and remarkably restrained piece of storytelling. Mr. Torreton, a member of the Comedie Francaise, is a marvelous actor, compact and reserved, with a gentleness and sorrowful intelligence that prevent his performance from becoming an exercise in saintliness. His tough, unshowy goodness is one of the film's consolations, though not its point.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tavernier strikes very few false notes. (One comes when Daniel and his girlfriend, after an especially depressing visit to the home of one of his students, make love in his car, as though to remind us that this is, after all, a French film.) ''It All Starts Today'' strikes a difficult and necessary moral balance, refusing to succumb to hopelessness but also refusing to rule it out.</p>
