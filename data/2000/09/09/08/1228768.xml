        <p>The DuPont Company, the nation's biggest chemical company, warned yesterday that soaring costs for fuel and raw materials, the declining value of the euro and potentially lower sales would push earnings for the rest of the year below Wall Street's expectations.</p>
        <p>The news sent shares of DuPont and those of other big chemical companies into a tailspin, but many analysts said investors overreacted.</p>
        <p>DuPont said its earnings for the year were likely to come in 2 percent to 5 percent below expectations, at $2.85 to $2.95 a share instead of the $3.01 that analysts expected.</p>
        <p>But DuPont executives said that they still expected earnings for the year to be 10 percent to 14 percent above results for the previous year and that 2001 earnings were likely to increase at least 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Despite those projections, shares of DuPont fell $4.88, to $42.13, their lowest point in four years as more than 17.5 million shares changed hands compared with a daily average of 2.7 million. Shares of the Dow Chemical Company fell $1.88, to $25.56, while Rohm &amp; Hass fell $2, to $29.38, and the Eastman Chemical Company dropped $1.19, to $45.31. Shares of the European chemical companies BASF and Bayer also fell.</p>
        <p>''I think the market oversold the stock today,'' said Frank J. Mitsch, a senior chemical industry analyst at Chase H&amp;Q. ''I think this is an excellent buying opportunity for long-term investors.</p>
        <p>''We really need to put this into perspective,'' he added, ''and consider that at the beginning of the year, DuPont's expectation for 2000 was $2.96. Then they saw some positive trends and adjusted upwards.''</p>
        <p>Alexander A. Hittle, a chemical industry analyst at A. G. Edwards, said he, too, was ''a little surprised that the stock pulled back as much as it did.''</p>
        <p>A. G. Edwards has recommended that investors maintain or hold their positions in DuPont. But Mr. Hittle said: ''We're being a little bit greedy. We'd like to pick it up in the high 30's.''</p>
        <p>As for the drop in DuPont's expectations, Mr. Hittle said: ''It's a bunch of things that DuPont didn't really have control over. And we've already seen the chemical companies pull back on exactly this collection of concerns about high raw material prices and slowing growth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitsch said investors, wary of a possible further slowing in the economy and its effect on sales, clearly took the warning as ''a signal for them to lighten up their portfolios.''</p>
        <p>But he added, ''We're now seeing DuPont stock trading at levels close to where it was trading in 1996 and, I can guarantee you, it's a much better company today than it was in 1996.''</p>
        <p>Analysts have also been encouraged by DuPont's earlier announcement that it planned to buy back up to 5 percent of its outstanding stock, which would help to maintain share prices, if not raise them.</p>
        <p>A. G. Edwards has a buy rating on Dow Chemical. ''Dow has been more oversold than DuPont,'' Mr. Hittle said, ''and Dow pays a bit better dividend. It's really the same bet as DuPont, that global economics will stay strong and that oil prices will cool off.''</p>
        <p>In a conference call, Gary M. Pfeiffer, DuPont's chief financial officer, said the company expected to achieve its new goal of more than 10 percent in earnings growth this year by increasing prices, cutting operating costs and being ''more prudent and selective in use of capital.''</p>
        <p>As recently as July, DuPont increased its earnings expectations as cost cutting appeared to be running ahead of schedule and sales were up. But oil prices have jumped 20 percent since then, the company said, while United States natural gas costs have leaped 30 percent.</p>
        <p>DuPont makes products like auto paints and lacquers, fabrics and health care products. Crude oil and natural gas make up 40 percent of the company's raw materials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitsch estimated that 30 percent of the company's sales were in Europe, making it particularly vulnerable to the euro's recent slide against the dollar.</p>
        <p>In the conference call, DuPont executives said they saw some weakening in volume from customers in the clothing business. They also said sales would be hurt by the shutdown of some Ford truck plants, which were closed for two weeks to make more tires available to replace those recalled by Bridgestone/Firestone last month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hittle said DuPont had been trying to put itself on a path of steady growth and to step away from the traditional volatility of the chemical industry, partly by diversifying.</p>
        <p>''DuPont has made a substantial effort to recast itself and move into the life sciences and away from the commodity chemical business,'' Mr. Hittle said. ''This announcement today reminds us that the life science vision of the company isn't mature and that for the time being this is still a chemical company, subject to the kinds of macroeconomic factors that make chemicals a difficult business.''</p>
