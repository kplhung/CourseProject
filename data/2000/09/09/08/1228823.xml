        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>BUSH AND GORE VIRTUALLY TIED  In the first spate of post-Labor Day national polls, traditionally considered among the most important of the campaign season, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas are locked in a tight race, with Mr. Gore retaining the momentum he gained after his party's convention and having made great strides among women, Democrats and independents. He also appears to have made considerable headway in turning around negative views of his personality and demeanor. In addition, he maintains an advantage on the issues. One poll has Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush absolutely tied, one has a virtual tie, and one has Mr. Gore leading but by a margin well within the margin of error. A poll of 810 likely voters by ABC News and the Washington Post shows Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush at 47 percent each. A Gallup Organization poll of 750 likely voters for CNN and USA Today has Mr. Gore leading 47 percent to 44 percent. And a Zogby poll of 1,001 likely voters shows a six-point lead for Mr. Gore, 46 percent to 40 percent. All three polls have margins of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points and were taken Monday through Wednesday.</p>

        <p>THE RUNNING MATES</p>
        <p>LIEBERMAN IN TEXAS  Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut ventured deep into Bush country yesterday, showing up in Houston, and he plans to return on Monday, signaling the Democrats' new-found confidence and boldness to campaign in a state they have almost no hope of carrying. Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, plans to hold a campaign forum in Houston on Friday on children's health care, an event that will no doubt include a few digs at George W. Bush's record on the subject as governor of Texas. On Monday, Mr. Lieberman will be the draw at a Democratic National Committee fund-raising luncheon at the home of Thomas J. Meredith, the former chief financial officer of Dell Computer and now the managing director of Dell's venture capital unit. The Democratic  committee expects to raise $500,000 at the lunch. Vice President Al Gore's campaign aides concede that he has no chance of winning Texas, but they note that an opponent's home state can be a useful forum for attacks, as Michael S. Dukakis learned in 1988, when Mr. Bush's father showed up in Massachusetts to lament water pollution in Boston harbor.</p>

        <p>CHENEY DUCKS A BULLET  The suspense was palpable. When Dick Cheney took a tour yesterday through a Londonderry, N.H., optics firm to emphasize his ticket's commitment to building a higher tech military, all eyes fell on an outsized gray helmet festooned with the latest in panoramic night vision goggles that was sitting on a table in the middle of the factory floor. Visions of one of the most-ridiculed images of the 1988 campaign, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts donning an unbecoming helmet in an ill-fated photo opportunity aboard a 63-ton tank, danced through cameramen's heads. As Mr. Cheney handled the helmet at Insight Technology Inc., an eager photographer called out, ''Do you think it's the right size?'' ''Come on, guys, you don't think I'm going to try it on, do you?'' Mr. Cheney replied, before walking over to a table of laser devices.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>FISTICUFFS IN FLORIDA  Two Republican Florida legislators from feuding families traded punches early Wednesday morning after one's father reportedly insulted the other's father on live radio. The Miami Herald reported that State Representative Renier Diaz de la Portilla and Representative Carlos A. Lacasa, both of the Miami area, duked it out in the parking lot of Radio Mambi, a popular talk radio station, after Mr. Lacasa's father insulted Mr. Diaz de la Portilla's father on a talk show on primary election night. After the comments, Mr. Diaz de la Portilla went to the station and demanded to be let in to defend his family's honor, frightening Martha Flores, the radio host, who exclaimed into the microphone, ''Hail Mary Mother of God, the Diaz de la Portillas are out there!'' Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, Renier's brother, had just been badly beaten in his race for mayor of Miami-Dade County, and had complained that the radio was unfair to him in favor of his rival, Mayor Alex Penelas. Renier Diaz de la Portilla and Carlos Lacasa met in the parking lot and fought, although each says the other started it. Ms. Flores begged her listeners to call the police, and so many listeners responded that the flood of calls caused the 911 system to crash.</p>

        <p>HAYDEN SEEKS CITY COUNCIL SEAT  Tom Hayden has spent close to 40 years rocking the political boat, first as a college student and later as a California assemblyman and senator. The state's term limits law is forcing him out of the Senate this year, but he is not giving up on public life. He announced yesterday that he would run for Los Angeles City Council next year, for a seat covering the Westside and parts of the San Fernando Valley that is being vacated by Mike Feuer. Mr. Hayden, a Democrat, joins a crowded field in the nonpartisan race.</p>

        <p>THE CONVENTIONS</p>
        <p>PHILADELPHIA'S RED SCARE  More than a month after the Republican convention ended, Philadelphia residents learned yesterday of the police department's rationale for a raid that resulted in 75 arrests at a warehouse where demonstrations were being planned. In a newly unsealed warrant, the police said some of the protesters had ''communist and leftist'' sponsors and others were sympathetic to ''the former Soviet-allied World Federation of Trade Unions.'' Stefan Presser, legal director of the state American Civil Liberties Union, called the warrant an outrage today. ''That document could have been written by Hoover's F.B.I. in the 40's and 50's,'' he said, complaining that it failed to justify the raid and served as a pretext for one of the largest instances of preventive detention in modern American history. Some of those arrested were kept in jail for more than two weeks after the convention and more than 300 cases are pending against demonstrators. The warrant also disclosed that the city police, who had been under court order not to infiltrate protest groups, used state troopers as infiltrators. Mr. Presser complained that the use of the troopers was ''an end run'' around basic civil liberties. The police declined to comment.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>A VICTORY FOR HAGELIN  A Superior Court judge in Long Beach, Calif., declined yesterday to block John Hagelin, one of two men claiming to be the Reform Party presidential nominee, from campaigning under the party's banner. Supporters of the other claimant, Patrick J. Buchanan, had asked that the judge, James L. Wright, name him the true nominee and order Mr. Hagelin and his loyalists to halt their political activities. Judge Wright refused but said he was willing to hear further arguments on Wednesday. The Reform Party split at its convention in Long Beach last month, with the faction dominated by hard-right conservatives nominating Mr. Buchanan and the faction made up mainly of those advocating government reform nominating Mr. Hagelin.</p>
