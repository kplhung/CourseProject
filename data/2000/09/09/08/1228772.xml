        <p>In the current argument about sponsorship of this year's presidential debates, too little attention has been paid to the cramped schedule imposed by the fall calendar of televised sports events. Nobody wants to force Americans to choose between these valuable debates, on the one hand, and ''Monday Night Football,'' the World Series or the Olympic Games on the other.</p>
        <p>To schedule around these events, as well as avoiding the final week of the campaign, the Commission on Presidential Debates chose four dates within a narrow two-week window in early and mid-October. These dates were not, to be sure, necessarily set in stone. In the past, the major party presidential candidates have routinely played fast and loose with the original dates chosen by the commission, as well as most other details of the debates, and negotiated changes between themselves.</p>

        <p>In the current argument about sponsorship of this year's presidential debates, too little attention has been paid to the cramped schedule imposed by the fall calendar of televised sports events. Nobody wants to force Americans to choose between these valuable debates, on the one hand, and ''Monday Night Football,'' the World Series or the Olympic Games on the other.</p>
        <p>To schedule around these events, as well as avoiding the final week of the campaign, the Commission on Presidential Debates chose four dates within a narrow two-week window in early and mid-October. These dates were not, to be sure, necessarily set in stone. In the past, the major party presidential candidates have routinely played fast and loose with the original dates chosen by the commission, as well as most other details of the debates, and negotiated changes between themselves.</p>
        <p>While the motivation, timing and political wisdom of the sweeping proposal by George W. Bush has been soundly attacked with reason, he does have a point in trying to schedule a debate before the Olympics start next Friday.</p>
        <p>The country is ready for debates now. The candidates should be, too. For months, they have been talking past each other on the stump and at their summer conventions, sending out unchallenged promises and claims to a public that is for the most part inattentive.</p>
        <p>Between now and Election Day, the candidates will hurl a couple of hundred million dollars or so worth of 30-second spots at each other. This will be harder for people to escape but won't be any more enlightening. It would be good to have the candidates engage each other directly and starting now, rather than three weeks from now, so the country can watch and make some judgments.</p>
        <p>In his curt dismissal of Mr. Bush's proposal for a debate next week, Al Gore (along with, naturally, the commission) has pointed out that only NBC would carry it, while all the broadcast networks have agreed to carry the prime-time debates proposed by the commission. Those so-called prime-time ''roadblocks'' by the broadcast networks, supposedly reserving uniform times for the commission's debates, may turn out, however, to be a bit less than advertised. Major League playoff games are scheduled on NBC during two of the commission's four debates, and on Fox on the other two nights.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is the commission's venue: confrontations in public auditoriums at colleges. These schools (like convention cities) have posted significant sums of money for the privilege of playing host. The commission's commitments to them, and the elaborate arrangements required for these live public events, were set in place well before either nominee was picked. Now that there are nominees who are entitled to a say in the matter, it is not easy to make adjustments -- though, when pressed in the past, the commission always has.</p>
        <p>NBC doesn't have these logistical problems. It can simply light up a studio on Tuesday night, set up a table for the vice president, the governor and Tim Russert -- and go. As it happens, the commission itself did promise this sort of format (minus Mr. Russert) for one of its own debates.</p>
        <p>In the NBC-sponsored debate, to be sure, the national television audience in the many, many millions would not have the benefit of two or three thousand on-site viewers supplied by the commission, all of whom have to be shushed into behaving themselves, including audience plants supplied by campaign tacticians. There would be nothing to watch or listen to but the candidates and the moderator.</p>
        <p>The unadorned studio setting worked (with a few extra reporters) for John Kennedy and Richard Nixon in what remains the gold standard for presidential debates. Why not give it a try? It might start a trend.</p>
