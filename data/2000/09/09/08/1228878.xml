        <p>Jared Palmer was tired and depressed. He and his Olympic partner, Alex O'Brien, who were seeded third, had just lost their men's doubles semifinal match in a crushing third-set tie breaker, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7), to the unseeded team of Max Mirnyi and Lleyton Hewitt.</p>
        <p>''I was pretty disappointed,'' Palmer said. ''I was tired. It's hard because there aren't too many opportunities to be in a Grand Slam final.''</p>

        <p>Jared Palmer was tired and depressed. He and his Olympic partner, Alex O'Brien, who were seeded third, had just lost their men's doubles semifinal match in a crushing third-set tie breaker, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (7), to the unseeded team of Max Mirnyi and Lleyton Hewitt.</p>
        <p>''I was pretty disappointed,'' Palmer said. ''I was tired. It's hard because there aren't too many opportunities to be in a Grand Slam final.''</p>
        <p>During a break between matches, friends told him not to bungle another one.</p>
        <p>''They gave me a little pep talk,'' he said. ''My girlfriend reminded me that I still had a chance to win a Grand Slam title.''</p>
        <p>And he did. Palmer and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario defeated Mirnyi and Anna Kournikova, 6-4, 6-3, yesterday in the mixed doubles championship in Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>
        <p>With Sanchez-Vicario stalking the baseline, Palmer played the net, slamming angled volleys.</p>
        <p>''Arantxa has such a good return that I was able to do some stuff up at the net,'' Palmer said. ''I think that was the key.''</p>
        <p>Sanchez-Vicario and Palmer first broached the idea of playing together at Wimbledon this year. At the beginning of the Open, Sanchez-Vicario almost decided against it, because she was nursing a sore ankle.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad she decided to play,'' Palmer said.</p>
        <p>Sanchez-Vicario laughed. ''Me too,'' she said.</p>
