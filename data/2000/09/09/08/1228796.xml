        <p>Next Wednesday, Dr. Mark S. McMahon says, he fully expects to sit next to Katie Couric or perhaps Dan Rather, gloating just a touch as he dispenses a batch of ''I told you so's'' to the world.</p>
        <p>He imagines a ''Dewey defeats Truman'' type of victory, a surprise toppling of Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, an election he has found few people even know will take place.</p>
        <p>''I'll be discussing my surprise victory,'' Dr. McMahon said, pondering the morning after as his campaign RV rolled through Day 1 of a five-day statewide tour, his first in his quixotic bid for the United States Senate. ''The media and the state Democratic Party decided Hillary Clinton would be the nominee without letting the people express themselves. There is such a high level of anti-Hillary feeling out there.''</p>
        <p>The primary may provide a measure of the extent of such feelings. Although it is hard to find anybody outside of Dr. McMahon's camp who expresses the belief he will win, the race is being watched as a barometer, however limited, of opposition to Mrs. Clinton, who receives high negative ratings in many polls that nevertheless put her about even with Representative Rick A. Lazio, her Republican opponent.</p>
        <p>Dr. McMahon, 44, of Manhattan, is a somewhat reserved orthopedic surgeon who occasionally needed reminders from his campaign manager to shake hands with potential voters. He perked up, though, whenever he encountered people who, informed of the primary, promised to support him. And there were a few.</p>
        <p>''She isn't from New York, which I do think matters,'' said Dave Salls, a computer systems analyst who greeted Dr. McMahon on the mall outside the State Capitol. ''And I'm not crazy about Bill Clinton, either. I have some concern about their ethical lapses.''</p>
        <p>But other Democrats saw Dr. McMahon's candidacy as a folly harmful to Mrs. Clinton. Arriving on the steps of the Greene County Courthouse in Catskill, Dr. McMahon got into a debate with the lone voter waiting for him, Joan Young, a 63-year-old retiree who said she had read about his scheduled appearance in the local paper and decided to confront him.</p>
        <p>''How are you going to feel if all your negativism contributes to her defeat?'' Mrs. Young asked.</p>
        <p>''Schumer had a primary,'' Dr. McMahon replied, referring to the 1998 three-way primary that Senator Charles E. Schumer won on his way to unseating Alfonse M. D' Amato. ''If Hillary wins the primary ---- ''</p>
        <p>''Will you back her then?'' Mrs. Young cut in.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to be premature,'' Dr. McMahon said.</p>
        <p>''I am personally committed to Hillary,'' Mrs. Young said, accepting some of Dr. McMahon's literature. ''You are not getting my vote.''</p>
        <p>Political analysts say Mrs. Young may have a point, that Dr. McMahon's candidacy may draw to the surface the anti-Hillary sentiment suspected even within her party.</p>
        <p>''No matter who is running in the primary, almost anybody can get 10, 12, maybe 15 percent of the vote just by having their name on the ballot,'' said Stuart Rothenberg, a Washington political analyst who charts Congressional races. ''It's when some obscure candidate gets 20 or 25 percent that you wonder, why are those votes going there? You have to see it as an anti-Hillary vote. To vote for the other candidate is to really vote against Mrs. Clinton, so I think it is worth watching.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's camp is watching, too. ''The interesting thing in that primary will be, if Dr. McMahon breaks 30 percent, what does that say about Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party?'' Bill Dal Col, Mr. Lazio's campaign manager, told an Albany radio station the other day. The Lazio campaign has issued a flurry of statements criticizing Mrs. Clinton for refusing to debate Dr. McMahon, though Dr. McMahon's campaign manager, Jon Fletcher, said Mr. Lazio too rejected a debate offer, on the grounds that Dr. McMahon was not yet the Democratic candidate.</p>
        <p>Dr. McMahon struggles for recognition just about everywhere. Hardly anybody at his stops today, including the one outside the Capitol, had a clue as to who he was, or that there was a primary.</p>
        <p>More reporters than voters awaited him; at the first stop in the Bronx this morning he gave a speech on crime in front of a police station before an audience of just two people, both reporters.</p>
        <p>Dr. McMahon blames the news media and the Democratic Party, which anointed Mrs. Clinton the party's candidate at its convention on May 16, for keeping voters in the dark. He is certain the party tried to dilute his support, and therefore the anti-Hillary vote, by encouraging four other candidates last month to seek a place on the ballot. A court ruled their petitions improper.</p>
        <p>But Dr. McMahon, who says he began his campaign nearly a year ago, admits he has not mounted a high-profile effort. He has broadcast no television or radio commercials, though his aides say a radio spot is in the works.</p>
        <p>He at times struggles to explain his differences with Mrs. Clinton. Once a registered Republican -- he switched in 1997 after five years with the Republicans -- he describes his politics as moderate, naming President Clinton as philosophical kin.</p>
        <p>His few campaign workers -- volunteers, most of them -- use expressions like ''grass-roots,'' ''unorthodox,'' ''wing and a prayer'' to describe his approach. He has raised $239,000, all but about $70,000 of it his own money, compared with the $21.9 million Mrs. Clinton has collected over a year.</p>
        <p>Bill de Blasio, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, said Dr. McMahon will not be taken seriously. Mr. De Blasio said primary elections typically have a low turnout and tend to be dominated by party stalwarts, whom he counts as solidly behind Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I'm confident that local Democratic leaders will be turning out core Democratic voters and I'm very, very confident that those voters are overwhelmingly favorable to Hillary,'' Mr. De Blasio said.</p>
        <p>Rarely is the primary even mentioned at her campaign stops, although one woman at a Bronx event a week ago did call out to people to vote for the first lady in the primary and in the general election on Nov. 7. Judith Hope, the state Democratic Party chairwoman, said the party has not mounted any get-out-the-vote effort for the primary on Mrs. Clinton's behalf.</p>
        <p>But Dr. McMahon and his staff insist he is for real.</p>
        <p>''He wants to go to Washington and do his duty,'' said Mr. Fletcher, his campaign manager, ''and for some reason that is laughed at.''</p>
