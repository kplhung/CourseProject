      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>''Nurse Betty'' takes the most hackneyed dramatic ploy of soap opera, a case of amnesia, and spins it into an irresistibly heady mixture of sadness and hilarity. At its giddiest peaks the movie, directed by Neil LaBute, produces that shivery feeling when your heart melts but at the same moment you want to burst out laughing. This whimsical rose-colored fairy tale with tragic undercurrents suggests a contemporary ''Wizard of Oz'' for grown-ups. It is easily the finest American comedy since David O. Russell's ''Flirting With Disaster,'' another road movie that never ran out of poignantly funny surprises.</p>
        <p>The event that whirls an innocent apple-cheeked waitress and nursing-school dropout from the American heartland into a state of enchanted forgetfulness is more traumatic than any tornado. When Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) accidentally witnesses the grisly murder of her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), by two hit men in the living room of her home, she instantly erases it from her mind. Deciding to leave her life in Fair Oaks, Kan., behind, she flees the past in a 1997 Buick LeSabre borrowed from her dead husband's used-car dealership.</p>

        <p>''Nurse Betty'' takes the most hackneyed dramatic ploy of soap opera, a case of amnesia, and spins it into an irresistibly heady mixture of sadness and hilarity. At its giddiest peaks the movie, directed by Neil LaBute, produces that shivery feeling when your heart melts but at the same moment you want to burst out laughing. This whimsical rose-colored fairy tale with tragic undercurrents suggests a contemporary ''Wizard of Oz'' for grown-ups. It is easily the finest American comedy since David O. Russell's ''Flirting With Disaster,'' another road movie that never ran out of poignantly funny surprises.</p>
        <p>The event that whirls an innocent apple-cheeked waitress and nursing-school dropout from the American heartland into a state of enchanted forgetfulness is more traumatic than any tornado. When Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) accidentally witnesses the grisly murder of her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), by two hit men in the living room of her home, she instantly erases it from her mind. Deciding to leave her life in Fair Oaks, Kan., behind, she flees the past in a 1997 Buick LeSabre borrowed from her dead husband's used-car dealership.</p>
        <p>The yellow brick road she travels, without a scarecrow, tin man or cowardly lion for company, is the great American highway leading west to our own Emerald City, the Hollywood dream factory. That factory has nourished Betty's fondest daydreams of living happily ever after with a handsome modern-day prince. And the goal of this not-terribly-bright, open-hearted young woman who dreams of getting her nursing degree because she wants to ''help people'' is nothing less than good old-fashioned romantic salvation.</p>
        <p>The brilliant and terrifying murder sequence at the beginning of the film establishes its deliberately bipolar mood and lays out its vision of modern America as a land of colliding, television-fed dreams of romance and upward mobility. But instead of glibly condemning the trash-television culture that has seeped into the deepest crevices of American life, ''Nurse Betty'' accepts that culture, recognizing both the necessity and the foolishness of manufactured dreams from which there is no longer any practical escape. Without them, it implies, there is no hope at all.</p>
        <p>As that murder sequence begins, Betty's no-good husband is being terrorized by two thugs while his wife in the next room is riveted to a videotape of that afternoon's episode of her favorite soap opera, ''A Reason to Love.'' Betty is so enamored of its young hero, Dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear), a gifted surgeon in a Los Angeles hospital, that her colleagues at the diner where she works have recently given her a birthday present of a life-size cutout of this dreamboat. As Ravell rebuffs the advances of the soap opera's designated vixen, who turns right around and accuses him of sexual assault, Betty's heart is in her mouth.</p>
        <p>Just then she is distracted by strange noises coming from the living room and nervously peeks through a crack in the door in time to witness the two killers (Morgan  Freeman and Chris Rock) shoot her husband dead. As the movie cuts between the television show and the murder, the soap opera seems strangely more real than the fantastic, inexplicable violence erupting only a few feet away.</p>
        <p>Emerging stunned but strangely cheerful, in a state diagnosed as ''post-traumatic stress'' (the word amnesia is never used), Betty embraces the fantasy that David Ravell is the sweetheart she jilted six years ago to marry Del. The time has come, she decides, for her to go to Los Angeles for their reunion.</p>
        <p>In a story that takes many wonderful twists and turns toward a bittersweet ending that strikes a perfect balance between tragedy and a dizzy kind of bliss, fantasy eventually overtakes reality. And for a brief, magical time Betty's traumatic delusion that Ravell and his fictional world actually exist becomes real. Or half real. (Among other things, ''Nurse Betty'' is about the power of fiercely held fantasies to involve others.)</p>
        <p>As Betty arrives in Los Angeles, lands herself a job at a hospital through astounding luck, then meets and charms the actor who plays Ravell, the movie cuts back to the killers tracking her down along with the stash of drugs she is unwittingly carrying in the trunk of the car. Charlie (Mr. Freeman), the older of the two, may be a professional hit man, but he is also a remarkably erudite and soft-spoken introvert who describes himself with bitter self-contempt as ''a garbage man of the human condition.'' Mr. Freeman's mixture of animal cunning and resigned sad-eyed wisdom finds the essence of Charlie's tortured soul.</p>
        <p>His accomplice and protege, Wesley (Mr. Rock), is an angry, hotheaded sociopath whose first reaction in tense situations is to explode. He is the one major character in the movie without a dream. Applying the same hysterical, blazing-eyed sarcasm to Wesley that he brings to his stand-up comedy, Mr. Rock conveys a glowering, chaotic nihilism.</p>
        <p>As the pair, helped by some snapshots of Betty, follow clues to her whereabouts, Charlie nurtures his own sudsy fantasy of Betty as a holy innocent, the romantic embodiment of everything he is not. And in one of the film's riskiest moments, he falls into a dreamy slow dance with the imaginary Betty at the edge of the Grand Canyon in the middle of the night. (The soundtrack injects just the right note of gentle mockery by playing Della Reese's overblown 1959 hit ''Don't You Know?'' in the background.)</p>
        <p>But the film's most enchanted sequence is the sustained romantic pas de deux of Betty and her dream lover, who, despite massive evidence to the contrary, she insists on believing is really Ravell and not a vain young actor named George McCord. Flattered and intrigued, George, in turn, nurtures his own fantasy that Betty, far from being mentally disturbed, is really an ambitious, dedicated Method actor who is so determined to be cast in the show that she never goes out of character. As the tension escalates over when and how the parallel bubble will finally burst, the screenplay by John C. Richards (who wrote the story) and James Flamberg attains a sublime comic delicacy.</p>
        <p>None of it would work if Ms. Zellweger's Betty weren't such a perfectly blended mixture of sweetness, innocence and stubborn determination tinged with a streak of petulance. Utterly likable but never saccharine, flighty but not dumb, Betty is a contemporary grown-up Dorothy Gale skipping down the yellow brick highway to meet the wonderful wizard.</p>
        <p>What more appropriate guise for his millennial incarnation than as a vain, self-centered actor who dreams of directing the show in which he's a star? Mr. Kinnear, in his richest screen performance, locates both the slippery charm and the nasty snub-nosed narcissism of his Ken Doll character.</p>
        <p>''Nurse Betty'' is as much a triumph for Mr. LaBute as it is for its cast, because its success is so dependent on its sustaining a precarious balance between humor and pathos, realism and fantasy. Compared with his vicious examinations of yuppie sexual cruelty, ''In the Company of Men'' and ''Your Friends and Neighbors,'' which went for the jugular, ''Nurse Betty'' is almost warm and fuzzy. Yet the director gives the film enough of a misanthropic edge to hold sentimentality at bay.</p>
        <p>A couple of violent flashes in the murder sequence are so (literally) hair-raising that you wonder for a second if the movie can recover. But it does. And the emotional payoff is enormous. ''Nurse Betty'' says it's O.K. to wallow in suds, that dreaming is only human. And without dreams to guide us in the land of a thousand and one beckoning television wizards, we would never leave Kansas.</p>
        <p>''Nurse Betty'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of extreme violence and some profanity.</p>
