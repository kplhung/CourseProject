        <p>THE BLIND ASSASSIN  By Margaret Atwood  521 pages. Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $26.</p>
        <p>Storytelling has long been a favorite hobby of many of Margaret Atwood's characters. For some, it's a way to distance themselves from painful memories while mythologizing mundane triumphs and travails; for others, it's a means of discovering their own identities, a way of connecting the dots in their lives, of turning random points of light into something resembling a starry constellation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Atwood's absorbing new novel, ''The Blind Assassin,'' features a story within a story within a story -- a science-fiction yarn within a hard-boiled tale of adultery within a larger narrative about familial love and dissolution. The novel is largely unencumbered by the feminist ideology that weighed down such earlier Atwood novels as ''The Edible Woman'' and ''The Handmaid's Tale,'' and for the most part it is also shorn of those books' satiric social vision. In fact, of all the author's books to date, ''The Blind Assassin'' is most purely a work of entertainment -- an expertly rendered Daphne du Maurieresque tale that showcases Ms. Atwood's narrative powers and her ardent love of the Gothic.</p>
        <p>To build suspense and create a narrative hall of mirrors, Ms. Atwood deftly cuts back and forth among three plot lines. The first chronicles the day-to-day life of an elderly woman named Iris Chase as she tries to come to terms with the many losses she has suffered over the years, including the suicide of her sister, the suicide of her husband and the apparently accidental death of her daughter. The second plot line concerns the events that led to Iris's marriage in the 1930's to a wealthy industrialist named Richard E. Griffen and her estrangement from her sister Laura. The third, which apparently consists of chapters from a potboiler Laura wrote, recounts the furtive affair of a well-to-do woman and her ne'er-do-well boyfriend, who meet in grungy, borrowed apartments and seedy hotels under the constant threat of exposure.</p>
        <p>Writing with uncommon authority and ease, Ms. Atwood conjures up the lives of the Canadian gentry in a small town just north of the United States border. She introduces us to the eccentric Chase family (they built a fortune in the button business) and she traces the reverberating effects that World War I would have on its members, in particular Iris and Laura.</p>
        <p>Laura is three years younger than Iris, and from the start she is a strange, watchful child, high-strung, inquisitive and single-mindedly literal. When told that God is everywhere she frets about his exact location, wondering if He were in the sun, in the moon, in the kitchen. ''She developed the ability,'' Iris recalls, ''to subtract herself in the blink of an eye -- one minute she'd be focused on you, the next she'd be elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>After their mother dies in childbirth, the sisters must cope with  their father's sullen withdrawal into an alcoholic stupor and the arrival of a sadistic tutor who has been entrusted with their education. Though Iris resents having to be responsible for her dreamy, wayward sister, it soon becomes clear that the two girls are alter egos of sorts -- doppelgangers and soul mates, like so many of the paired heroines in Ms. Atwood's novels, from Cordelia and Elaine in ''Cat's Eye'' to Zenia and her adversaries in ''The Robber Bride.''</p>
        <p>As teenagers, Laura and Iris find common cause in befriending a charismatic young man named Alex Thomas, who is visiting their small town. When Alex falls under police suspicion for being a Communist and a labor agitator, the sisters hide him in the family attic. Both soon become enamored of this sardonic and slightly sinister man -- a development that will have serious repercussions not only for them but also for successive generations of their family.</p>
        <p>Much of what ensues in ''The Blind Assassin'' is unapologetically melodramatic: in addition to several suicides in the Chase family, there are intimations of child abuse and intra-family adultery, not to mention loads of scheming, manipulation and intrigue. Ms. Atwood grounds these events in carefully observed social and emotional detail, even as she sends up her more sensationalistic impulses in the extracts from Laura's novelette (also called ''The Blind Assassin''), which features passages from a pulp fiction story written by its hero. That story, set on a planet far, far away, depicts a bloody, class-riven society that sacrifices its young to propitiate ancient gods, and a chilling assassination plot involving a blind killer.</p>
        <p>Compelling in its lurid way as ''The Blind Assassin'' the novelette may be, it pales in comparison to the virtuosic storytelling on display in ''The Blind Assassin'' the novel.</p>
