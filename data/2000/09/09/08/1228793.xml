        <p>The political troubles facing Gov. George W. Bush have exposed a serious rift between the Bush organization and the Republican National Committee over how best to conduct the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Several high-ranking officials at party headquarters here say they were furious that the campaign had shut them out and rejected their advice on things like television commercials and how Mr. Bush negotiates a schedule of debates with Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>One high-ranking party official official complained that the view from Austin, Tex., where Mr. Bush has his headquarters, has been that the party has nothing to add.</p>
        <p>''They acted like they were the smartest people in the world -- and that no one here in Washington had anything to contribute,'' he said. ''Their view was: 'We really understand the American people. You people in Washington don't.' ''</p>
        <p>Officials on both sides said that there had been some friction for months between officials in Austin and at the party but that it escalated two weeks ago when Mr. Bush himself ordered the party to shelve a 30-second commercial questioning Mr. Gore's ethics by using misleading information.</p>
        <p>Many Republican officials said the party had been unfairly blamed for championing the commercial, even though several Bush aides had pushed for it, as well. Some Bush aides, in turn, complained that the party did not have a better chain-of-command for reviewing and distributing advertisements -- and that it had already delivered the commercial to some television stations when the decision was made to pull it.</p>
        <p>After the controversy surrounding the pulled commercial, Bush campaign officials removed David Israelite, the party's political director, as coordinator of its advertising campaign. The campaign replaced him with Maria Cino, who was the Bush organization's political director during the primaries and who moved to the party in the spring as a deputy chairman.</p>
        <p>A Bush lieutenant said Mr. Israelite had been ''the center of the universe as far as the spots go,'' but that campaign officials prefer ''a broader group of people considering the options.''</p>
        <p>One of the biggest complaints among party officials is that for months they were rebuffed in their efforts to keep Mr. Gore on the defensive by starting an early advertising campaign, as the Democrats did against Mr. Bush. Throughout the summer, Democrats spent $35 million on commercials promoting Mr. Gore or pounding Mr. Bush, while Republicans spent roughly $25 million. Some party officials said they had pressed for the campaign to approve a much more aggressive television blitz against Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>But Bush officials said there was no need for Mr. Bush to begin attacking when he was enjoying a solid lead in the polls and when he was vowing to keep the tone of the campaign positive.</p>
        <p>Party officials also complained that members of the campaign high-command in Texas instructed them earlier in the year to stop staging events and putting out news releases intended to knock Mr. Gore off stride. Such efforts, these officials said, could have prevented the vice president from gaining ground.</p>
        <p>''Austin wants to control everything,'' said one strategist who works closely with officials at the campaign and at the Republican Party.</p>
        <p>One party official said he had suggested that the party put on an anti-Gore event to help Mr. Bush regain momentum and capture attention in the press immediately after the Democratic convention. But, he said, the idea was dismissed by Bush aides in Austin.</p>
        <p>As is common for a presidential campaign, the Bush organization effectively seized control of the party after the primary season ended and installed some of its loyalists -- including Ms. Cino and Fred Meyer, the chief coordinator between the party and the Bush campaign -- at party headquarters. It left the chairman, Jim Nicholson, in place.</p>
        <p>Several people described Mr. Nicholson as a loyal partisan, and one of the few top party officials who has not complained about the Bush campaign. ''I'm not aware that there's very much concern,'' Mr. Nicholson said in an interview. ''In any campaign there are always certain personality conflicts. But there's even very little of that.''</p>
        <p>Yet many party stalwarts who work closely with Mr. Nicholson went as far as to say that members of the tight-knit Bush high command in Austin were overly confident, even arrogant. A mocking phrase making the rounds among party officials here is ''Austin Knows Best.''</p>
        <p>Several well-placed Republicans said the confusion over the advertising campaign -- and who is running things -- has frustrated many top officials, including the party's chief of staff, Tom Cole, and Alex Castellanos, the media consultant who is producing the Republican commercials. Neither agreed to be interviewed for this article.</p>
        <p>It is not unusual for such tensions to arise at a time when a candidate is watching his poll numbers sag, as Mr. Bush is. But many officials on both sides said the strains are deeper than usual, prompting one party official to say that Bush aides would likely investigate sources for this article. ''There will be witch hunts,'' he said. ''There will be victims.''</p>
        <p>The tensions stand in marked contrast to the relationship between the Gore campaign and the the Democratic National Committee, which have worked closely together to mount a drive to discredit Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''The D.N.C. has been a lot more coordinated with the campaign,'' added one strategist with close ties to the Republican Party, ''and has been complimenting the campaign on a message standpoint.''</p>
        <p>It should not be a surprise, perhaps, that Bush camp has not devoted more attention to party officials here. Mr. Bush has cast himself as an outsider and built his campaign in part on his disdain for Washington and politics as usual.</p>
        <p>Some people involved in the Bush operation and at the party cautioned that it was simplistic to characterize the rift as one between Austin and Washington. They noted, for instance, that there have been debates among officials in both places about how and when the party should begin broadcasting commercials attacking Mr. Gore -- and that those debates are ongoing.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of frayed egos, bad relationships and strong-willed beliefs on difference sides,'' said one Republican consultant who is close to officials in both camps. ''It's not the kind of climate you want at this point in the race.''</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a Bush campaign spokesman, brushed of suggestions of disputes, saying, ''We're all working together to win in November.''</p>
        <p>Representative John R. Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said some of the finger-pointing may be from Washington insiders who feel left out of the campaign.</p>
        <p>''There's a low of squawking, a lot of complaining -- there are some babies involved in this stuff,'' he said. '''All of the people who live inside Washington are resentful that they're not running the campaign.''</p>
