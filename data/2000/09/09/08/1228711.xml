        <p>OLD cars are an integral part of the landscape at Hemmings Motor News.</p>
        <p>Hemmings, a monthly magazine chock-full of advertisements for collectible cars, parts and related services, also owns a collection of 78 old cars and trucks, a handful of them quite rare. Of these, about 45 are registered, insured and capable of being used on public roads.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the pampered cars in many collections, the Hemmings fleet is actually driven -- in parades, for movie shoots and, each summer, by journalists who come here for a day of deja vu on the roads around Hemmings offices in what was once a schoolhouse west of town.</p>
        <p>The collection is the pride of Terry Ehrich, 59, the publisher and editor in chief of Hemmings and a major shareholder in its parent company, Watering Inc. He and his brother, Perez, the vice president for business operations, publish Hemmings and two other car-related magazines, Special Interest Autos and the new Hemmings Rods &amp; Performance, along with an almanac, a host of car calendars and related books. The company is branching out into Internet and television ventures.</p>
        <p>The circulation of Hemmings, which looks like an 800-page phone book, is about 260,000 copies a month. Special Interest Autos, published six times a year, has a circulation of about 30,000, Terry Ehrich said, and some 50,000 copies of Rods &amp; Performance, just out with its second issue, are being distributed, many of them at car shows.</p>
        <p>In building the collection over the last two decades, Mr. Ehrich said he had sought two basic types of cars: ''icons'' and ''the unusual.''</p>
        <p>Icons, he said, are ''cars that people are going to drive by and say, 'My mom had a car just like that.' '' So the collection has its Mustang, a dark blue '66 convertible, and its Malibu, a red '69 convertible with a 396-cubic-inch V-8. The other category, ''the unusual,'' also includes the ''small and cute.''</p>
        <p>Probably the most unusual car in the collection is a teardrop-shaped two-door sedan, a 1934 McQuay-Norris. It is one of two survivors of the six that were made and is the only one in running condition, Mr. Ehrich said. Using Ford engines and drivetrains, the cars were made as publicity vehicles for the McQuay-Norris Manufacturing Company, an automotive parts maker. Hemmings shows it off with the collection's most recent acquisition, a similarly shaped aluminum camping trailer from the late 1940's, unrestored but in reasonable condition.</p>
        <p>Fitting the ''small and cute'' bill are a 1938 American Bantam roadster; a 1950 Crosley Gasporter, a tiny tanker built for use at small airports; and two minicars, a 1960 BMW Isetta and a 1966 King Midget.</p>
        <p>The collection has several purposes, including advertising and public relations. ''The first use of these vehicles is visibility,'' Mr. Ehrich said, ''here at home at the office and especially at our filling station, on the road and at car shows.''</p>
        <p>Some of the cars are displayed at an old-time filling station that the company operates next to its headquarters in town. Several cars and trucks are always on display at the station, and the two service bays have become a sales floor for Hemmings publications, model cars and clothing items. Out front, young attendants actually pump gas, clean windshields and check the oil.</p>
        <p>''As a leader in so many areas of this American life, Vermont has outlawed billboards since sometime back in the 50's,'' Mr. Ehrich said. ''The vehicles make good billboards.''</p>
        <p>They also send a message that cuts to the heart of what Hemmings is all about -- preserving pieces of auto history. ''One of my favorites, just in terms of putting our name out in a visible way, is the 1934 Ford wrecker,'' Mr. Ehrich said. ''I just love to drive that in a parade towing a slightly ratty Model A Ford.''</p>
        <p>Another purpose of the collection, Mr. Ehrich said, ''is to show that Hemmings is an active participant in the hobby, not just a publishing company making a living on the hobby.''</p>
        <p>The collection is cared for by two consultants to Hemmings, Justus Taylor and Jim Howe. Mr. Taylor, a tall and trim 60, is a former leather craftsman, cinematographer and motorcycle racer for BMW who now flies a vintage sailplane. Mr. Howe, a young-looking 53, lives near Bennington on 20 acres that he calls However Wild Farm. He once worked in a machine shop in Bennington and for a while repaired and restored Volkswagen Beetles for resale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor is the collection's troubleshooter. He said: ''The thing that I do best is to be able to analyze a problem -- 'What is that noise? Where is it coming from?' -- and to come up with a solution. Then Jim and I get together, and the two of us equal three.''</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Howe's specialties is scouting prospective additions for the collection. ''Quite a few people approach Hemmings about buying their vehicles,'' he said. ''Selling it to Hemmings is sort of like sending it to heaven. And if it's something that Terry decides he's interested in, then I check it out. What I look for is what was it like before it was restored. The first thing I do is slide under the vehicle. I don't really care what the top looks like.''</p>
        <p>To make repairs, he often hunts for parts by telephone or computer, as was the case with an ailing starter on a '58 Volvo 445 wagon. ''Today I learned that the starter's Bendix gear doesn't exist in the U.S.,'' he said. ''So I've got to get on the Internet and wade through some Swedish.''</p>
        <p>And then there are the public-relations and advertising functions. ''I also spend a fair amount of time helping Hemmings decide where and when to use their vehicles,'' Mr. Howe said. That comes to some 50 to 75 events a year, he estimates.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, when dealing with old cars and trucks, a little detective work is called for, along with mechanical skills. ''One night I got a call from the Hemmings filling station that the tow truck wouldn't start,'' Mr. Howe said. ''I got them to describe the problem, and it sounded to me like it was out of gas. They said, 'No, we filled it.' ''</p>
        <p>When he got to the station, Mr. Howe checked the gas tank, which is under the passenger seat, and it was empty. But again, the attendants insisted that they had filled the tank.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Well, how much did it take?' '' Mr. Howe said.</p>
        <p>''And they said, 'Oh, not much -- a couple of quarts.'</p>
        <p>''And I said, 'Show me where you put it.' Know where they had put it? In the radiator.''</p>
