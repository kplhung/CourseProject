        <p>As the Rangers open training camp, the core of veterans will be happy to know that their new coach, Ron Low, will start with a clean slate.</p>
        <p>''I'm going in with an absolutely open mind,'' Low said yesterday. ''It's pretty much an open book.''</p>
        <p>Theo Fleury and Valery Kamensky will probably be happiest of all to hear that. They were by far the biggest disappointments on last season's team. On paper, at least, the team does not appear to be significantly changed from the one that broke camp last fall.</p>
        <p>But there are some significant differences, and not only behind the bench. The re-signing of Mark Messier, who turns 40 in January, was the Rangers' marquee move of the off-season. The signing of enigmatic defenseman Vladimir Malakhov and the acquisition of the pugnacious Sandy McCarthy were two of the bigger moves by the new team president and general manager, Glen Sather.</p>
        <p>Stephane Quintal, who was suspended by the Rangers at the end of last season for negative comments he had made in the press, will be back in camp, at least for its start, two members of the Rangers' organization said yesterday. Lest a cynic think that the Rangers are again gearing their hopes on highly paid veterans, however, Low said he is hoping some very promising rookies make the team.</p>
        <p>But unlike last season, when Pavel Brendl's name was written into the opening-night lineup before training camp had even started -- only to be quickly written out when Brendl showed up to his first National Hockey League training camp horribly out of shape -- Low said that everyone who makes the team this season will have to do so in camp.</p>
        <p>''I've looked at a lot of tapes of last season,'' Low said. ''To me, what happened doesn't make sense. Something was amiss and we've got to fix it. How I'm going to do it, I don't know yet. But I'm excited about it.''</p>
        <p>Low said that he hopes that the Rangers' three biggest prospects, Pavel Brendl, Manny Malhotra and Jamie Lundmark, all make the team. Low indicated that he would give a pair of young defensemen, Tomas Kloucek and Dale Purinton, long looks.</p>
        <p>But the player Low said impressed him most at last week's rookie tournament in Kitchener, Ontario was an obscure, 6-foot-6-inch, 19-year-old left wing from Russia named Yevgeny Gusarov.</p>
        <p>''He weighs 225 pounds,'' Low said of Gusarov, the Rangers' ninth selection in the 1999 draft, who played in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League last season. ''Last year, he weighed 189. The kid has grown up a little bit.''</p>
        <p>One player who will not be available to the Rangers for an undetermined time is goaltender Mike Richter, who is returning from reconstructive knee surgery. Richter was scheduled to be examined again yesterday.</p>
