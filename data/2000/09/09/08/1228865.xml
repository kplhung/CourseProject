        <p>My own life choice belies a Sept. 6 letter writer's assertion that men rarely have to make the ''hard choice'' between ''work or family'' to become, for instance, a partner at a law firm. Years ago, as a veteran of some major Wall Street law firms, I made a very difficult and ultimately very satisfying decision to forgo the money, prestige and the sacrifice of family time that come with making partner.</p>
        <p>I am far from alone among my male lawyer colleagues in having made such a choice. But in my view, I had to make that choice for my own, and my family's, happiness.</p>
