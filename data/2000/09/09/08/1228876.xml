        <p>A little more than three hours after Serena Williams lost in the quarterfinals to Lindsay Davenport, ending her bid to defend her 1999 United States Open singles title, publishers of the daily draw sheet learned Wednesday night that she had withdrawn from playing in the doubles tournament with her sister Venus.</p>
        <p>The Williams sisters, the defending doubles champions, were scheduled to play their semifinal match yesterday.</p>
        <p>But at 11 a.m. yesterday, the Women's Tennis Association Tour issued a statement that Serena Williams had pulled out because of an inflammation in her left foot, at the joint of the big toe. It was the same injury that forced her to withdraw from the du Maurier Open final against Martina Hingis in Montreal on Aug. 20. Williams was losing, 3-0, in the third set to Hingis when she defaulted.</p>
        <p>The United States Open's medical director, Brian Hainline, examined Serena Williams yesterday and confirmed the injury.</p>
        <p>Her next tournament is the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, where she is scheduled to play doubles with her sister.</p>
