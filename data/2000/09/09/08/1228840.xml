        <p>So how bad was it yesterday -- the traffic, that is -- on the busiest day of the meeting of world leaders at the United Nations?</p>
        <p>Police Officer Clyde Williams, who gives a lot of thought to such things, advised against looking at the obvious: Do not count cars or track the labyrinth of road closings dotting Manhattan's East Side. Do not pay undue attention to the 45-minute backup at the 63rd Street exit of the southbound Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive or to the simultaneous swarms of limousines outside Radio City Music Hall (stars attending the MTV awards) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (dignitaries attending President Clinton's goodbye bash).</p>
        <p>Close your eyes, Officer Williams said. Traffic in New York is something to be heard, not seen.</p>
        <p>''How many horns do you hear?'' he asked from his patrol car, which was blocking cars from entering the southbound F.D.R. Drive north of the United Nations. ''New Yorkers are used to traffic, but they'll let you know when they're upset.''</p>
        <p>Honk! Beep! Hoot!</p>
        <p>At that particular moment on that particular corner, New York was coping, more than less, according to Officer Williams's congestion-calibrated ear. The red-faced doctor in the fancy car who was turned away from the F.D.R. Drive muttered under his breath, but he did not put up much of a fight. The F.B.I. and Secret Service agents were pushier, but even they are frozen out in such circumstances, and they eventually relented without so much as a screech of the tires.  Even as traffic got thicker and the racket grew louder -- ''It is horrendous out there!'' a taxi driver screamed from his window -- Officer Williams and his crew of traffic police stood their ground.</p>
        <p>''I tell people to go south and hope,'' said a traffic control agent, Serge Beaubrun, funneling cars toward Second Avenue. ''It is not what they like to hear, but then anyone who got in a car this week and drove in Manhattan has to be out of his mind.''</p>
        <p>Patricia Atunez, trapped on Lexington Avenue when it was transformed into a parking lot by President Clinton's motorcade (even the bicyclists were required to wait), confessed to similar misgivings.</p>
        <p>''I should have planned better, or maybe just taken the subway,'' said Ms. Atunez, who was late for a job interview. ''It's worse than I've ever seen it.''</p>
        <p>Officer Williams, who has worked in the highway police unit for nine years, has a rule of thumb about who is exempt from security-invoked street closings, perhaps best described in shorthand as the ''Mission Impossible'' rule: All drivers are suspect, no matter who they are, unless the man behind the wheel is a chief of police.</p>
        <p>''Even then,'' Officer Williams said, ''You have to worry he has one of those 'Mission Impossible' masks that he will tear off as soon as you let him go by.''</p>
        <p>Across Midtown yesterday and last night, the ''Mission Impossible''  rule was causing frustration for drivers and the police alike.</p>
        <p>James Combs and Michael Lennex drove a truck for 12 hours from North Carolina to make furniture deliveries in the New York area. Their all-night drive was grueling enough, but they spent two more hours yesterday morning trying to get past the United Nations to York Avenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Combs said he drove around the neighborhood six times, following a maze of detours and alternate routes, before blowing his cool and making an illegal left turn onto 63rd Street in front of a convoy of police.</p>
        <p>''This place stinks,'' said Mr. Combs, who was not cited for the infraction. ''They just shouldn't allow trucks in the city. If you want your furniture, come to North Carolina and get it yourself, or meet us on the Long Island Expressway.''</p>
        <p>It was a bad day all around for delivery and repair services. The driver of a van for Yourgrocer.com hovered hopelessly around several East Side neighborhoods, unable to stay anywhere too long because of a cacophony of horns from drivers trying to make do on streets that had lost lanes to orange cones.</p>
        <p>''Gotta go!'' the driver yelled to a reporter asking questions.</p>
        <p>Tom Ramhold, who fixes pay phones for Verizon, had to park 20 blocks away from one East Side job because the driving became impossible. As if the walk weren't bad enough, he got a parking ticket for overstaying a 30-minute limit.</p>
        <p>Joe Richardson, who delivers beds for the Futon Warehouse, did not even bother with a parking spot, leaving his delivery van double parked on First Avenue and walking down 52nd street with the bed. That was nothing, however, he said, compared with the phone call he had to make to a customer on 49th Street: Wait until next week.</p>
        <p>''I tried, but I just can't get there,'' he said. ''She is going to have to sleep on the floor.''</p>
        <p>Even some commuters who opted for public transit got snared by yesterday's problems. The police closed Madison Avenue about 6:30 p.m. because of the Clinton party, forcing express buses to use Park Avenue.  Fortunately, because the president was running late, Madison remained open during the worst of the evening rush.</p>
        <p>''We were able to delay until the commuters getting out of work at 5 o'clock were gone, but it is a big problem,'' said Inspector James Hegarty, who heads the police department's traffic control division. ''Combined with the MTV awards, we are seeing a tremendous amount of traffic.''</p>
        <p>There will probably be no way of knowing for sure how the gridlock measured against previous tie-ups in  Manhattan, though almost everyone agrees that it will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the great traffic events in the city's motoring history.</p>
        <p>The only thing worse than the congestion, Sharon Barnett said, was the meter running on her cab at 50th Street and Lexington Avenue. She was standing outside the door, surveying the standstill, still 20 blocks away from her doctor's office.</p>
        <p>''I can't believe how bad it is,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Yet for all the misery, according to some unscientific measures, there were fewer problems yesterday than on Wednesday, when an unexpected closing of the Brooklyn Bridge (a 22-year-old Manhattan man jumped to his death shortly before 5 p.m., after two hours of threatening to do so, the authorities said) and closings on the F.D.R. Drive were more numerous.</p>
        <p>Inspector Hegarty said traffic at  some intersections, especially near the United Nations, seemed lighter yesterday than it had been the day before, but the footprint of congestion had grown across Midtown to include previously untouched areas of the West Side. Traffic got so bad on the West Side late yesterday, he said, that officers held in reserve were moved to the Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue.. At Radio City Music Hall, more than 50 musicians were late last night because of the chaos.</p>
        <p>David Fein, director of operations of Metrocommute.com, which has 80 traffic cameras around the New York region, said the Web site was receiving double the usual number of hits. A more informed public, he said, seemed to be avoiding the worst places. ''I am looking at a picture now, a live shot, and traffic is light on the F.D.R.,'' he said last night. ''Everybody has been warning everyone away from there, but if you go there now you will have a clean shot uptown.''</p>
