      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Shot in limpid black and white, studded with symbols and contemplative vistas of sea and sky, ''Clouds'' is a small movie with large pretensions. It concerns a young physicist named Robert St. John, who, to work out a radical new cosmology (''It may subvert basic models,'' he tells a colleague), takes a leave from his teaching post and sets himself up in a quiet town on the Northern California coast. There Robert (Michael Patrick Gaffney) meets a painstakingly selected cast of eccentrics: a chatty, pious landlady, a profane and cynical artist and a mysterious woman who claims to have known him in the past.</p>
        <p>Robert's past is revisited through dreamlike flashbacks, sometimes accompanied by voice-over. These moments suggest that in his quest for knowledge of the world, Robert has neglected the experience of it. He's so obsessed with meaning that he's lost any sense of who he is. Luckily, it all comes right in the end. ''Are not the zero and the world the same?'' Robert asks us. ''The suffering and the love? Reality and I are the same.''</p>

        <p>Shot in limpid black and white, studded with symbols and contemplative vistas of sea and sky, ''Clouds'' is a small movie with large pretensions. It concerns a young physicist named Robert St. John, who, to work out a radical new cosmology (''It may subvert basic models,'' he tells a colleague), takes a leave from his teaching post and sets himself up in a quiet town on the Northern California coast. There Robert (Michael Patrick Gaffney) meets a painstakingly selected cast of eccentrics: a chatty, pious landlady, a profane and cynical artist and a mysterious woman who claims to have known him in the past.</p>
        <p>Robert's past is revisited through dreamlike flashbacks, sometimes accompanied by voice-over. These moments suggest that in his quest for knowledge of the world, Robert has neglected the experience of it. He's so obsessed with meaning that he's lost any sense of who he is. Luckily, it all comes right in the end. ''Are not the zero and the world the same?'' Robert asks us. ''The suffering and the love? Reality and I are the same.''</p>
        <p>Well, actually, no. ''Clouds,'' written and directed by Don Thompson, is so eager to impel our contemplation of its big ideas (whatever they may be) that it neglects to give its story much in the way of interest or credibility. The dialogue consists of long philosophical stretches of argument interrupted by sudden bursts of inexplicable emotions. Mr. Thompson creates an illusion of enigmatic seriousness by ploddingly spelling out themes -- art versus science, truth versus illusion -- then smudging them with bits of contrived surreal humor and artsy incongruity.</p>
        <p>All this is in the service of something so lofty it can't be explained. Robert deflects inquiries into his cosmological project, warning his artist friend that it's too mystical for him to grasp and telling his colleague that his theory may be ''beyond coherence, even mathematical coherence.'' This may be the movie's truest assessment of itself, unless that comes a bit later, when a character who seems to be Robert's ex-girlfriend tells him he's ''about the most intelligent dumb person I've ever met.'' ''Clouds'' is about the dumbest intelligent movie I've ever seen.</p>
        <p>CLOUDS  Written and directed by Don Thompson; director of photography, Gary Lindsay; edited by Mr. Lindsay; music by Nawang Khechog; production designer, Gordon Halloran; produced by Mr. Thompson and Mr. Lindsay; released by In Pictures, NextPix and Pacific Grove Productions. Running time: 95 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: Michael Patrick Gaffney (Robert St. John), Jennifer Jordan Day (Beatrice), Richard Barrows (Tab), Rob Nilsson (Frank) and Patricia Ann Rubens (Mrs. Martin).</p>
