        <p>The recent tax-fraud trial of the husband of Westchester's district attorney featured a virtual tour of the couple's spectacular house, with enough photos of the swimming pool and living room to make spectators wonder whether they had stepped into the pages of Architectural Digest.</p>
        <p>Now those who missed the trial don't have to live vicariously. They can just buy the house.</p>
        <p>After weeks of rumors, District Attorney Jeanine F. Pirro and her husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., put their house on the market late today. And the suggested price, according to their broker, Adrienne Lipman of Julia B. Fee Real Estate in Rye, is somewhat north of $5 million for the 8,000-square-foot, three-story house, which sits on 1.5 walled-in acres with an electronic gate, a heated six-car garage and the most famous pig fence in Westchester.</p>
        <p>In June, Mr. Pirro, one of the county's most influential real estate development lawyers, was convicted, along with his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, of conspiracy and tax evasion, for improperly deducting $1.2 million of Albert Pirro's personal expenses as business write-offs between 1988 and 1997. They are scheduled to be sentenced on Sept. 28 by Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. in Federal District Court in White Plains.</p>
        <p>And while an appeal is still possible, some friends now say privately that Albert Pirro, who has already spent more than $1 million in legal fees, may not have the resources to appeal what is expected to be a three- or four-year sentence.</p>
        <p>So the decision to sell the house represents the clearest signal yet that the Pirros are bracing for the transition from a double-income family making close to seven figures to a single-income family dependent on Mrs. Pirro's government salary of $136,700.</p>
        <p>''I believe it's the right financial decision for my family at this time,'' Mrs. Pirro said in a brief telephone interview today.</p>
        <p>She declined to say where her family would eventually settle. But friends say that Mrs. Pirro and the couple's two children are likely to opt for a more modest place that is a reasonable distance from her office in White Plains and the children's private school, which is not far from their current home.</p>
        <p>Since the trial, the Pirros -- one of Westchester's most glamorous couples, and powerful in Republican Party politics -- have been the subject of relentless gossip about their future, including the idea that she might leave the district attorney's office for a more lucrative job in private practice, something her spokeswoman has repeatedly denied.</p>
        <p>There is no mystery, however, about the Pirros' 14-room house on Flagler Drive, given the avalanche of details provided during the trial by the painters, woodworkers and contractors who worked on the property.</p>
        <p>There's a pool house and a children's playhouse, a huge area of soaring ceilings and French doors called the Great Space between the living and dining rooms, a wine cellar, cedar-lined walk-in closets, an outdoor heated swimming pool with a Jacuzzi, and everywhere an abundance of Italian marble. And of course there is a wrought-iron enclosure in the yard for the Pirros' pet Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs, Homer and Wilbur.</p>
        <p>Oh, and the property taxes are $41,000 a year, Ms. Lipman said.</p>
        <p>As is often the case with property owned by famous people, the sales process will be quite discreet, and prospective buyers will have to undergo a background screening, she said.</p>
        <p>Even so, the Pirros have high hopes that their house can sell quickly in a hot market.</p>
        <p>''They really do want to get on with their lives,'' Ms. Lipman said. ''Things have happened in their lives, and they're going with the flow, I guess.''</p>
