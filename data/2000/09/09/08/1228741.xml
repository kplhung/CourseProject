        <p>China Eastern Airlines said today that it had received preliminary approval to sell a 25 percent stake in its tiny cargo subsidiary to China Airlines of Taiwan, a first step in what would be a landmark in cross-strait cooperation if Taiwan's government allows the deal to go through.</p>

        <p>China Eastern Airlines said today that it had received preliminary approval to sell a 25 percent stake in its tiny cargo subsidiary to China Airlines of Taiwan, a first step in what would be a landmark in cross-strait cooperation if Taiwan's government allows the deal to go through.</p>
        <p>While Taiwan companies have invested heavily in joint ventures with state-owned enterprises on the mainland and even invested directly in some state-owned companies, there has yet been no Taiwanese investment in China's air carriers, which were only recently opened to limited foreign investment.</p>
        <p>Though Taiwan companies have invested as much as $40 billion in mainland ventures, Taiwan's government has resisted the trend, fearing that the island's economy could grow too dependent on the mainland and in turn weaken Taipei's ability to govern the island free from Beijing's interference. Taipei maintains a ban on direct trade and transportation links with the mainland.</p>
        <p>China Airlines has acknowledged that it is in talks to buy a stake in the Shanghai-based China Cargo Airlines, a unit of the mainland's state-owned China Eastern Airlines, but has said it has not yet asked Taipei for approval of any deal.</p>
        <p>China Airlines would need approval from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the Economic Ministry's Investment Commission to proceed with such an investment.</p>
        <p>And while the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the mainland's aviation regulator, has approved the share sale, any deal would require still higher approvals from Beijing.</p>
        <p>Under the proposed deal, China Airlines would buy a 25 percent stake in the cargo carrier, diluting China Eastern's stake to 65 percent and that of another Chinese state company, the China Ocean Shipping Company, to 10 percent. China Cargo, which is the nation's only all-cargo carrier but has just three planes, is now 70 percent owned by China Eastern and 30 percent owned by China Ocean Shipping. Both China Eastern and China Airlines have said that financial details and the timing of the stake sale have yet to be decided.</p>
