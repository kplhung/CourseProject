        <p>''Went to Coney Island on a Mission From God . . . Back by 5'' is, thank goodness, not as gawkily clever as its title, but it is an odd mixture of boyish high spirits and grown-up melodrama.</p>
        <p>It begins like an art-house episode of ''The Wonder Years,'' with an adult male voice-over recalling bygone days of youth as snippets from pop songs mark the passing of the decades. In bleached-out flashbacks to the old neighborhood, three friends -- Daniel, Stan and Richie -- progress from ''It's a Beautiful Morning'' to ''Hot Child in the City'' to ''I'll Stop the World,'' as their clothes and haircuts change accordingly.</p>
        <p>The best of these moments is a cringe-inducingly authentic garage-band cover of Adam and the Ants' unforgettable (though not for lack of trying) hit ''Ant Music.''</p>
        <p>As the movie follows Daniel (Jon Cryer) and Stan (Rick Stear) on their search for their lost chum, who they believe is homeless and mentally ill, the flashbacks sketch their own slide from youthful optimism to the misery and frustration of their 30's. Daniel works at a jewelry store that's a small step up from a pawnshop, and Stan, who limps as a result of a botched operation in childhood, drinks, gambles and taxes the patience of his longtime girlfriend, Gabby (Ione Skye). As the two friends wander through the desolate winter landscape of Coney Island, we learn about the sexual confusion and family tragedy that led to Richie's disappearance.</p>
        <p>''Went to Coney Island'' is structured more like a play than a movie. Its scenes -- Daniel and Stan's encounters with the eccentric loners who populate the Boardwalk in the off-season -- seem talky and stagy, and its action moves backward, toward a reckoning with the past. Its cinematic interest is largely a result of Adam Beckman's photography, with its artful overexposures and spare wide-angle compositions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cryer collaborated on the screenplay with the director, Richard Schenkman. A few years back, the two of them made a quirky, unassuming comedy called ''The Pompatus of Love,'' about the romantic struggles of a group of young men in New York. This new film is more ambitious, but its better moments are distinguished by the scruffy egghead humor that made their earlier effort a pleasant surprise.</p>
        <p>The banter between Mr. Cryer and Mr. Stear flows easily and believably and is often quite funny. But the script seems hamstrung between smart-alecky self-consciousness -- a Skee-Ball parlor operator who talks like a snide graduate student, a waitress who hands over a menu with the comment ''It's as thick as 'The Fountainhead' '' -- and heart-wrenching naturalism.</p>
        <p>Richie's story is too weighted with pain to comport with the student-film surrealism that surrounds it, and Rafael Baez, as the adult Richie, seems to belong in a different movie. A subplot involving Stan's gambling debts and a thuggish deli owner seems pasted in out of a dozen other ''Mean Streets'' knockoffs. The filmmakers' earnestness and intelligence ultimately work at cross purposes, and ''Went to Coney Island'' never quite comes to dramatic or comic life.</p>
        <p>This film is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual references and profanity.</p>
