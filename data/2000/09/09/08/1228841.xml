        <p>Teacher strikes in Buffalo, N.Y., and Hamilton Township, N.J., interrupted the start of the school year for thousands of children yesterday.</p>
        <p>Classes officially started on Wednesday in both districts. Buffalo schools will remain closed today; in Hamilton Township, it was still not clear at 10 p.m. yesterday whether there would be school today.</p>
        <p>In Buffalo, the union representing 3,800 teachers voted yesterday morning to strike as some students were already making their way to school.</p>
        <p>The strike, which caused classes to be canceled for 47,000 students, created child care complications for many parents and forced district officials to scramble to handle the children who showed up because they were unaware of the strike.</p>
        <p>The mayor of Buffalo, Anthony Masiello, whose two daughters attend the public schools, criticized the Buffalo Teachers Federation for the strike.</p>
        <p>''It was totally uncalled for and is quite frankly irresponsible,'' the mayor said.</p>
        <p>The union, which walked out for 13 days in 1976, authorized the strike even though Justice Kevin M. Dillon of State Supreme Court in Buffalo issued an injunction on Wednesday forbidding it. Union and district negotiators are at odds over wages, health care provisions and a proposal to contract with outside social agencies to serve troubled students.</p>
        <p>''This move is something that we've been forced into,'' said Philip Rumore, president of the teachers' union. ''This is not something we do lightly.''</p>
        <p>Teachers have been working without a contract since June 30, 1999. Mr. Rumore said teachers were not happy with a four-year contract offer that included no raise the first year and raises of 2 percent in each of the subsequent years. But district officials said that with built-in steps of 1 to 5 percent for most teachers, salaries would rise an average of 3.5 percent each year.</p>
        <p>''If the teachers are complaining about pay and about the $53,000 to $60,000 that's double the average salary of Buffalo, what about the single mother who now has to lose a day's pay because of the teachers' strike?'' asked Paul G. Buchanan, the school board president. ''To me it just makes no sense.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday evening, the schools superintendent, Marion Canedo, gave the teachers an 8 p.m. deadline to decide whether they would return to work today, Mr. Rumore said. When Mr. Rumore responded that the union planned to decide in the morning, Ms. Canedo ordered the schools closed, said a board member who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>One student who was surprised to find his teachers on the picket line had some advice about the strike.  ''There really isn't any school and we're not learning anything,'' said the student, Matt Gausebeck, a junior at Hutchinson Central Technical High School. ''Maybe they should figure out a contract and get back in the classroom where they belong.''</p>
        <p>Teachers who struck in 1976 said it was not easy to strike again.</p>
        <p>''I'm disappointed, but you have to do something at some point for ourselves and for the children of the city,'' said Frank Christopher, a physical education teacher at the D'Youville Porter Campus School. ''If it weren't for the teachers, the children of this city wouldn't have half the things they do.''</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, members of the Hamilton Township Education Association, which represents 1,450 teachers and other school employees,  were also defying a court order when they voted unanimously on Wednesday to strike. Officials then canceled yesterday's classes.</p>
        <p>An official in Superintendent Neil Bencivengo's office said he was in contract talks and was not available  for comment.</p>
        <p>Union officials have sought 5 percent raises in each of the three years of the contract; the board has offered raises of 4 percent in the first year of the contract, 4.1 percent in the second year and 4.2 percent in the third year.</p>
