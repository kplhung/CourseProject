        <p>Organizers of this year's Labor Day parade, to be held tomorrow, are planning to turn the march into a major platform for Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign.</p>
        <p>To highlight the first lady, whom they have endorsed, the parade's organizers have taken the unusual step of not inviting Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was briefly Mrs. Clinton's opponent. Nor have they invited the Republican who is running, Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>The parade up Fifth Avenue, which will begin at 11 a.m. at 44th Street and end at 72nd Street, is expected to give Mrs. Clinton a giant audience -- labor leaders predict at least 250,000 marchers.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the parade has been scheduled for the Saturday after Labor Day, because so many union members did not want their three-day holiday weekends cut short for the march. Union leaders also wanted to hold it on a day when more people would be in Manhattan to see it.</p>
        <p>The march comes during a difficult year for the city's unions. Workers at the Museum of Modern Art remain on strike after four months, more than 200 workers at Domino Sugar in Brooklyn have been on strike for more than a year and a campaign to unionize restaurant workers at the Metropolitan Opera remains stalled after a year. In addition, the city's 300,000 municipal workers do not appear close to getting a contract with the city -- another major subject of the parade.</p>
        <p>Brian M. McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, the parade's sponsor and an affiliate of the A.F.L-C.I.O., said Mrs. Clinton would give separate speeches to some unions that plan to turn out thousands of members: the teachers, electrical workers, building trades' unions and District Council 37. ''We want to showcase her meeting with working people,'' Mr. McLaughlin said. He said the labor council also wanted the parade to showcase two endorsed incumbents in Congress who face tough challenges in Tuesday's Democratic primary: Major R. Owens and Edolphus Towns.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Lazio was not invited, labor leaders said that two unions that have endorsed him, the police and the corrections officers, might carry pro-Lazio signs. Michael Marr, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said the Republican would be campaigning in Queens and Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>As for the mayor, if he shows up uninvited, Mr. McLaughlin said, he will nonetheless be welcome.</p>
        <p>But a spokeswoman for the mayor said he would not attend. Mr. Giuliani was invited to march each year for the last five years and accepted every year except for 1999, when he had a scheduling conflict, the spokeswoman said.</p>
