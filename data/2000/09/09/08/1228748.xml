        <p>A strike begun three days ago by truckers who blockaded fuel depots to protest spiraling fuel costs spread today as workers from other sectors of the economy joined the demonstrations, disrupting transportation systems throughout the country.</p>
        <p>Farmers, airline workers, bus drivers, taxi drivers and even the owners of river barges and sightseeing boats that cruise the Seine have now joined in the protest. Their actions, along with the truckers' blockade, have combined to produce the growing fuel shortages and varying degrees of inconvenience for consumers.</p>
        <p>In Bordeaux, for instance, farmers set fire to piles of tires on train tracks, leading to havoc with train schedules in the area. In the north, they blocked border posts between France and Belgium. In other towns, private ambulance drivers used their vehicles to block streets.</p>
        <p>Paris had largely been spared in the last few days. But today hundreds of taxis poured into the city in a slow-moving column that created a traffic jam that lasted hours.</p>
        <p>In addition, the truckers' blockade of the country's fuel depots has begun to be felt the pumps. France's three major oil companies said that up to 80 percent of their stations were reporting shortages. Some drivers also found it difficult to get fuel because police officers were patrolling gas stations to make sure that police, hospital and emergency service vehicles got the first chance to buy the gas that was available. In other towns, officials sought only to limit hoarding by putting a cap on the amount of fuel that could be purchased.</p>
        <p>The strike has quickly become a huge political problem for Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who on Wednesday broke off negotiations with the truckers after two of the country's three major unions refused to ratify an offer of a 15-cent reduction per liter in fuel taxes.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Jospin did not comment on the strike. But his transportation minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, talked tough, saying, ''If we let things go on, that could break the process of growth and development that's going on in our country.''</p>
        <p>The protest began gathering steam on Sunday after a week in which the government offered a series of financial measures to fishermen, who had also blockaded the country's ports in August because of rising fuel prices.</p>
        <p>Many of the truckers believed that they would get relief in a long awaited package of tax cuts that Mr. Jospin's government unveiled last week. But the government instead chose to use a budget surplus from a booming economy in other ways. The plan included only a cut in the taxes on home heating oil.</p>
        <p>The cost of fuel has been rising even faster in Europe than in the United States because of the decline in the value of the Euro. On top of that, fuel carries a government surcharge of more than 70 percent in France.</p>
        <p>The cost of diesel fuel in France has risen about 40 percent in the last year. A gallon of diesel fuel costs about $2.84 here.</p>
        <p>Part of Mr. Jospin's problem in negotiating with the truckers is that even his latest offer has been sharply criticized by environmentalists in his governing coalition. The Greens say his concessions break earlier promises to continue to push France toward using rail traffic over more polluting trucks.</p>
        <p>In addition to blocking various border posts, farmers scuffled with the authorities at the Channel Tunnel as they tried to block freight trucks from boarding trains to Britain.</p>
        <p>In Brussels, the European Union  asked France to prove that it was taking measures to ensure the free movement of goods and access to its ports.</p>
        <p>The truckers' blockades, set up at some 80 depots throughout the country, were beginning to take a heavy toll in some areas. One French newspaper reported that school cafeterias in the Vosges region, in eastern France, faced shortages because food suppliers ran out of gas for their delivery trucks. And some school bus routes were shut down in the central city of Lyon.</p>
