        <p>Dance Theater of Harlem has popped up at City Center for a two-week engagement, which was announced only recently. It is good to have a major ballet company back in New York in the fall, a season increasingly low on classical dancing.</p>
        <p>Arthur Mitchell, as the troupe's founder and artistic director, continues to show us how classical technique is a basic grammar to be used in different ways over the centuries.</p>
        <p>In this respect, the first of the season's four separate programs on Wednesday night provided a perfect primer. Contemporary ballet was represented by ''Memento Mori,'' a sleek and quietly emotional premiere by Augustus van Heerden, a former principal dancer in Dance Theater of Harlem and now one of its balletmasters. Romantic ballet was embodied by a long excerpt, Act II from Frederic Franklin's staging of ''Giselle,'' now called ''Creole Giselle'' because the action has been transposed to 19th-century Louisiana.</p>
        <p>Classical technique, as part of a blend with other idioms, was on display in the 1999 ''South African Suite.'' The choreography by Mr. Mitchell, Mr. van Heerden and Laveen Naidu came across with a welcome new coherence and the lively sweet music, now played onstage by local musicians rather than the Soweto String Quartet as last year, was as delightful as ever.</p>
        <p>In this kind of eclectic program, one might wonder where to find Dance Theater of Harlem's artistic profile. But one has only to look at the dancing itself to realize that style defines the company: style here means contemporary ballet, derived from George Balanchine's view that classical dancing is to be used in a modern manner.</p>
        <p>It might be possible, then, to see this act of ''Giselle,'' concerned originally with 19th-century Wilis, or spirits of dead jilted maidens, as too contemporary. It is performed by the company in a no-nonsense style that does not reach deep into 19th-century images of ethereal spirits and strongly etched poses. But this act, although bereft of the first act that would explain the company's updated version, is exactly what all ballet fans should run down to see at City Center. There is an ingenious stylization here that enhances a classic in a rich way.</p>
        <p>To understand this ''Giselle,'' one should see the seven dancers in ''Memento Mori.'' This is Mr. van Heerden's second piece of choreography but already it has a natural flow and clarity that beautifully match a fine score, ''Music Dolorosa,'' by the Latvian composer Peteris Vasks.</p>
        <p>The cries of pain in the music, rising clearly if subtly, are echoed in the choreography's approach to familiar images. It would be easy to fall into cliches: a male death figure picks a man out of a cluster of three couples and disappears with him into blackness.</p>
        <p>Yet there is an original contrast between the muscular death figure, seen in the beginning and end with his back to the audience, wrists crossed overhead and fists clenched. Ramon Thielen was a sinister stealthy allegorical character, slinking around his potential victims, who were more classical in a series of duets.</p>
        <p>Kip Sturm, who was eventually pulled into Mr. Thielen's orbit, began to imitate the death figure's biceps-flexing movement, but entered first with Kellye A. Saunders. This pair was in gold, and Pamela Allen-Cumming's tights for Lenore Pavlakos and James Washington were fuchsia and teal for Caroline Rocher and Donald Williams. Mr. Thielen, bare-chested like the other men, had a sinewy design on his silver tights.</p>
        <p>The duets were full of draped lifts and caresses, sometimes executed in unison or in waves while the strings in the orchestra (conducted by Joseph E. Fields) slid down and up against a relentless beat. The dancing became similarly intense although Mr. van Heerden kept to a contemporary style that even looked abstract until a blast of gold lighting by Erik C. Bruce revealed the death figure alone, ready to begin again.</p>
        <p>Mr. van Heerden has not quite integrated the death figure's role into the ensemble. Yet there is a dramatic power to the piece as a whole.</p>
        <p>The same streamlined look was seen in the female corps of ''Creole Giselle.'' In the full version, the heroine is the daughter of a freed slave in Louisiana and is seduced by Albert, the son of a rich Creole family. Act II is set in a bayou, and Albert arrives in a flatboat, punted by his servant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franklin's amended choreography for Myrta, queen of the Wilis, diverges from the standard version, and Ms. Pavlakos's Myrta was less than convincing, despite her high leaps.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sturm was splendid in his dancing and heartfelt mime as Albert, and Ms. Saunders was a willowy Giselle, in tune with the neo-Romantic stylization, which could have been derived from Fokine rather than Petipa. Mr. Thielen, with a reduced role, was Hilarion, Albert's rival.</p>
        <p>''South African Suite,'' which has women on toe, African warrior dances and mimetic animal dances, works as an exuberant divertissement, and Camille Parson was outstanding as the ''it'' girl of the piece. The string musicians were Gayle Dixon, Katsuko Esaki, Chrystal Garner and Chris Finckel, with percussion by Donald Eaton and Samir Chatterjee.</p>
