        <p>ROBERT B. REICH, the Democratic policy guru and friend of organized labor, entered enemy territory this week with a peace proposal of sorts. He wrote an article on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal proposing a scheme for school vouchers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reich is not the first liberal to come out for vouchers, but it is startling to see a defector with his credentials -- a former labor secretary, co-founder of the liberal magazine The American Prospect -- breaking with the Democratic Party and its union allies on a critical issue in an election season. Politically, it's a little like Milton Friedman coming out for bigger government.</p>
        <p>But it's actually not much of a philosophical stretch for Mr. Reich, now a professor at Brandeis University. He sees vouchers as a way to achieve classic liberal goals. He wants to integrate schools, redistribute educational dollars and help the poor escape from inner-city schools. Besides revolutionizing education, his idea could be one of the most radical urban renewal programs ever.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reich wants to scrap the entire current system of school financing. Tax revenues would be pooled, maybe at the state or the federal level, and given directly to parents in the form of ''progressive'' vouchers pegged to family income. The vouchers, redeemable at any certified private or public school, might be $12,000 for the least affluent students and $4,000 for the richest.</p>
        <p>Public schools in the suburbs, which now often spend $9,000 per pupil, couldn't cover their costs with $4,000 vouchers. They would have to collect extra tuition from well-off students. They would also, Mr. Reich expects, look for another source of revenue: those $12,000 vouchers in the hands of city kids.</p>
        <p>''The large vouchers would make it worthwhile to send vans to pick up and drop off groups of inner-city students,'' Mr. Reich writes. ''Although the most intensive competition would center on the best-behaved poor kids whose parents were most aggressive in seeking out good schools, the large vouchers would spur schools to recruit and retain more difficult children as well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reich does not pretend that Greenwich's schools would be sending caravans down to the South Bronx. But it would be realistic, he said in an interview yesterday, to expect some Westchester schools near the Bronx to profit by taking in 5 or 10 percent of their students from across the city line. And there would presumably be a growing number of private schools eager for those vouchers.</p>
        <p>''It's important to get central city kids out of public schools where social problems are concentrated,'' Mr. Reich said. ''Americans are segregated by income more than ever before. It is a huge and growing problem. We know that forced busing doesn't work. Using vouchers is the only way I see to solve the problem.''</p>
        <p>THE voucher plan could be enormously valuable to cities in retaining the middle class, because parents would no longer see a house in a suburban school district as the only affordable way to get a good education for their children. That change would hardly gladden the suburbanites who already paid a premium for houses in those districts and now could be facing extra tuition payments, although some of them might welcome vouchers good for partial tuition at private schools.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Reich has not been excommunicated from the Democratic Party. ''I've been very surprised by the reaction,'' he said. ''There have been several hundred phone and e-mail messages, and not a single one has been negative. People who are quite liberal Democrats say they like the idea because it deals with the central inequity of education, which is that less money is spent per pupil in poor communities than in rich communities.''</p>
        <p>Social justice for liberals, market incentives for conservatives -- the plan has everything going for it, except for one slight problem. No one expects it to be adopted any time soon, including Mr. Reich. ''It's too radical a change for any politician to seriously entertain at the national level,'' he said. ''It would have to bubble up from below. There would be have to be some experimentation at the state level.''</p>
        <p>It's hard to imagine New York politicians starting the experiment, given the power of the teachers' unions and the Democratic Party. But recent polls found that most voters in the city and the state supported vouchers, with support especially strong among blacks and Hispanics. Some Democrats may consider Mr. Reich a traitor to the party, but he seems to have a lot of company.</p>
