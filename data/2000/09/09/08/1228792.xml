        <p>WHICH market do you believe?</p>
        <p>A look at the American equity market shows a generally positive picture. Valuations are high, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is near record levels. Clearly, productivity and profits are expected to stay high for the indefinite future.</p>
        <p>But in the credit markets, the outlook appears much bleaker. There, money is becoming harder to find, and the price is expensive. Lower-quality borrowers always have to pay more than safe ones, but this year the spreads have widened significantly. That would be expected if people feared a recession, but then one would also expect to see the stock market doing much worse than it is.</p>
        <p>Part of the explanation for this split is simple supply and demand. The government is buying back Treasury bonds, so yields on those securities may have been pushed lower than they otherwise would be. But companies are borrowing at a rapid pace even though investors have not  been very eager to buy bonds. Bob Prince, the research director at Bridgewater Associates, a money management firm, says higher rates have been needed to lure overseas buyers, who now buy about a third of corporate debt.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the widening spreads meant that borrowers paid more, but credit to companies that are willing to pay the tab did not really seem restricted. The banks have been willing lenders, but there are now scattered signs that they are growing more cautious. Since late last year, more and more banks have been telling the Federal Reserve that they are tightening credit standards. The default rate on junk bonds has been creeping up, even as the economy hums along with rapid growth.</p>
        <p>This fall may prove to be the testing time for capital markets. Wall Street is gearing up for another big dose of initial public offerings, and Europeans -- who have provided a lot of the capital to finance American markets -- need to raise a lot of money to finance wireless telephone licenses that have fetched amazing bids at government auctions in Europe. If investors don't put up enough capital, stocks could suffer far more than bond prices.</p>
        <p>For investors, something can be said for buying what others don't want. Just now, that is debt. Corporate bonds won't do well if the economy goes belly up, and they will not perform as well as stocks if corporate profits keep booming for years and years. But within that range of economic outcomes is a middle ground that favors bonds.</p>
        <p>Martin Fridson, Merrill Lynch's junk bond guru, reports that the spreads of junk bond yields over Treasuries are now far higher than his economic model would forecast -- higher, in fact, than at any time in the past save for a brief period in 1998-99 after the Russian default and Asian crisis, when investors feared a worldwide recession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prince, the Bridgewater analyst, calculates that the divergence between the pricing of stocks and of corporate bonds ''is near a 40-year high'' because the bond market has priced in plenty of risk of economic disappointment while the stock market sees little risk.</p>
        <p>That situation is not likely to last forever. There is plenty of reason to conclude that corporate bonds are a better buy than stocks right now, and investors may be starting to do just that. Though mutual fund buyers have shunned corporate bond funds this year, AMG Data Services last night reported a surge of money into such funds in the week ended Wednesday, with junk bond funds doing particularly well. The tide may be turning.</p>
