        <p>The offices at the decaying headquarters of the government consumer protection agency here are threadbare and sparsely furnished, and the elevators do not always work. The concept of class-action suits does not exist in the local legal code, and even if it did, there is no network of consumer advocacy groups or lawyers to promote them.</p>
        <p>Tire failures and rollovers involving Bridgestone/Firestone and the Ford Motor Company have emerged as the biggest product liability controversy in years, and Venezuela as one of the scandal's main focal points. But neither the legal system nor the government regulatory structure here is prepared for a case of this magnitude, experts here agree.</p>
        <p>''In North America, the theme of consumer protection is constantly on the agenda, to the point that you even make movies like 'Erin Brockovich,' '' said Liliana Ortega, a leading human rights lawyer here. ''But this is an extremely disjointed society, with consumers who are badly educated as to their rights and very little tradition of asserting those rights. So this case is emblematic and sets a very important precedent.''</p>
        <p>Last week, citing what it described as evidence that both Firestone and Ford were aware of defects in their products, the Venezuelan government recommended that criminal charges be filed against both companies, and this week Firestone agreed to recall 62,000 of its tires here. More than 60 deaths have been caused by blowouts on Ford Explorers on Venezuelan highways, government officials say.</p>
        <p>For that reason, the Firestone-Ford debacle would seem tailor-made for President Hugo Chavez. A 46-year-old former army colonel, cashiered after leading a failed coup in 1992, Mr. Chavez won a landslide victory in 1998 on a platform that promised social justice and a new, more equitable economic order. Then, after gaining passage of a new Constitution, he repeated that feat in July.</p>
        <p>On a visit to China last year, Mr. Chavez visited Mao's tomb and announced, in a variation on one of the Great Helmsman's most famous phrases, that ''Venezuela has stood up.'' He has also led the recent resurgence of OPEC that has pushed oil prices to their highest level in a decade, and in speeches here he regularly lambastes ''savage neo-liberalism'' and the ''rotten oligarchy'' that puts profit ahead of the national interest.</p>
        <p>''Under previous governments, nobody took an interest in things like this, and the directors of this agency were businessmen themselves, Chamber of Commerce types, foxes guarding the chicken coop,'' said Jorge Dominguez, chief inspector of the Consumer Defense and Education Institute, the consumer agency. ''But now, because we have a new president, this has changed.''</p>
        <p>Yet to describe Indecu, as the agency is known in Spanish, as a bare-bones operation is to be generous. With a budget of just over $3 million and 300 employees, it has a limited ability to monitor the safety of products and respond to consumer complaints in this nation of 23 million people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dominguez, for example, is an agronomist whose main area of expertise is spoiled food and who has to make do with a staff of just 20. In the Firestone-Ford case, the chief investigator is actually a civic-minded volunteer, Carlos Salanova, an auto dealer and former tire salesman from the same town as Indecu's president, Samuel Ruh Rios.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruh said this week that he had been invited to testify at Congressional hearings in Washington and that he was willing to go if Mr. Chavez authorized him to do so. But it is not clear how much new information Indecu would be able to add to what is already known in the United States.</p>
        <p>''The investigation began much more than two months ago, but the beginning was very slow,'' Mr. Dominguez said. ''The first problem we ran into was that there were no statistics, no entity we could turn to and say, 'Give me the list of all accidents involving Explorers.' ''</p>
        <p>Part of the gap has been filled by Franklin Hoet, a prominent lawyer here whose daughter and son-in-law were injured and their nanny killed when their Explorer rolled over in 1998. Mr. Hoet's clients included both Firestone and Ford, but he has severed ties with both and is now encouraging other Venezuelan victims to join the effort to ''force them to take responsibility for their actions.''</p>
        <p>Venezuela's new Constitution includes an article that guarantees consumers the right to safe, high-quality products. But Mr. Hoet describes the provision as ''more an ideal than a reality,'' noting that ''there is also a right to life, but every day people are killed or raped in jail.''</p>
        <p>Furthermore, legislation that would establish standards for consumer products and put teeth into regulations is feeble or riddled with loopholes. ''What is lacking is more solid institutions to control the quality of production,'' said Gerardo Blyde, a leading constitutional lawyer and member of Congress. ''A consumer protection law exists, but it has to be reformed to include a more effective control mechanism.''</p>
        <p>But the biggest impediment to resolving the case is probably the judicial system. ''Venezuelan courts are severely questioned and criticized because they cannot offer even the minimum guarantees of judicial security,'' Ms. Ortega said. ''There are problems of impunity, corruption, lack of professional training and resources, and cases derailed in deference to political or commercial interests.''</p>
        <p>With his own actions, Mr. Hoet has made it clear that he agrees with that assessment. The civil complaint and demand for damages to be made on behalf of his family will be filed in the United States, not here, he said, adding that he finds it odd that Firestone and Ford might object.</p>
        <p>''For 20 years the business community has complained about the lack of a reliable justice system, saying that it is one of the problems that discourage foreign investment,'' he said. ''Now, all of a sudden in a complicated case like this, with all these deaths and injuries, they are suddenly going to say everything is just fine?''</p>
        <p>His opinion is not universally shared here. ''I don't think a U.S. court has jurisdiction over this matter,'' Mr. Blyde said. ''These tires were produced in Venezuela, and both the buyer and the seller are Venezuelan. If you buy a Sony television and there's a problem, it should be Sony of Venezuela who responds, not Sony in Japan.''</p>
        <p>But in a country that is undergoing what Mr. Chavez calls a ''peaceful social revolution,'' legal and administrative criteria may not be the only relevant factors. Countervailing political currents could also complicate the situation.</p>
        <p>For one thing, the roughly 25,000 Venezuelan owners of Explorers, which sell for about $27,000 here, several times the average annual income, are hardly Mr. Chavez's natural constituency. He presents himself as the paladin of the poor, and those with incomes high enough to afford such vehicles voted overwhelmingly for his opponents.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Chavez has had a largely cordial relationship with Ford, the No. 2 automaker here, with 18 percent of the market. One of Mr. Chavez's central populist initiatives has been production of a ''people's car,'' and Ford was an early supporter of the program, and its generous tax advantages.</p>
        <p>''This is a government that has focused almost exclusively on politics during the 18 months it has been in power, and has not dedicated itself to the themes of administration and law,'' Mr. Hoet said. ''I think it is more convenient for everyone involved in this matter that the case be resolved in the United States.''</p>
