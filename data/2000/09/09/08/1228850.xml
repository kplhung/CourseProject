        <p>Reflecting the strong demand in Manhattan both for luxury housing and for new office space, the tower taking shape on the west side of Broadway from 55th to 56th Street will contain the new headquarters for Random House on its lower floors and be topped by 111 luxury condominium apartments.</p>
        <p>Upon completion, which is expected in the summer of 2002, the building will be 630 feet high, about the same height as the 50-story office tower nearby at 9 West 57th Street. The new building's 26-story commercial component will house 650,000 square feet of offices for the publishing company, a division of Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant. Bertelsmann will own that part of the tower, which will be called the Random House Building and have its entrance on Broadway.</p>

        <p>Reflecting the strong demand in Manhattan both for luxury housing and for new office space, the tower taking shape on the west side of Broadway from 55th to 56th Street will contain the new headquarters for Random House on its lower floors and be topped by 111 luxury condominium apartments.</p>
        <p>Upon completion, which is expected in the summer of 2002, the building will be 630 feet high, about the same height as the 50-story office tower nearby at 9 West 57th Street. The new building's 26-story commercial component will house 650,000 square feet of offices for the publishing company, a division of Bertelsmann A.G., the German media giant. Bertelsmann will own that part of the tower, which will be called the Random House Building and have its entrance on Broadway.</p>
        <p>The 23-story residential component, to be known as the Park Imperial, will have its entrance at 230 West 56th Street. Its one- to three-bedroom apartments, including five penthouses, will range from 811 to 2,975 square feet. All the units will have 10-foot-high ceilings and, since they start at 360 feet above street level, clear views of the Manhattan skyline, the Hudson River or Central Park.</p>
        <p>The building is being marketed as a 70-story tower -- with the first residential floor labeled the 48th --  based on the developer's calculation of the number of floors it would have if it were entirely residential. The Related Companies, which is developing the $425 million project, is not the first to take such an approach: Trump World Tower, near the United Nations, is billed as a 90-story building, although it has 72 floors.</p>
        <p>At the Park Imperial, ''the views became the keystone for our plans for the building,'' said David J. Wine, vice chairman of Related. Though the company is best known for rental housing, it chose to build condominiums on the West 56th Street site ''because we knew people would be willing to pay a lot more money to own an apartment with those views than to rent one,'' Mr. Wine said.</p>
        <p>Prices for the units are expected to be $575,000 to $4 million, or an average of $927 a square foot, said Louise Sunshine, president of the Sunshine Group, the project's sales agent.</p>
        <p>According to preliminary figures for the second quarter from the Real Estate Board of New York, the median price for condominiums in the Midtown West neighborhood was $575 a square foot, up from $392 for the same period in 1999. At the high end, Ms. Sunshine said, prices go as high as $3,000 a square foot at the Trump International Hotel and Tower at 1 Central Park West.</p>
        <p>The monthly common charges, including real estate taxes, at the Park Imperial are expected to be $725 to $2,720. The Park Imperial is eligible to receive a 10-year tax abatement from the city; without it, the charges would be $1,365 to $5,100 a month.</p>
        <p>Related cannot sell the units until its offering plan is accepted for filing by the state attorney general's office; acceptance is expected by the end of this month. But since the Sunshine Group started marketing the units in August, 71 letters of intent have been received to buy  specific apartments, Ms. Sunshine  said.</p>
        <p>Related assembled the Park Imperial site from 1997 through 1999, buying air rights from owners of adjacent structures at the same time. That allowed the company to increase the height of the building by 10 residential stories. The building is being constructed ''as of right,'' meaning that no special permits or approvals were needed.</p>
        <p>While Related decided early on to construct condominiums on the building's higher floors, Mr. Wine said, ''the strength of New York's economy gave us many options for the lower portion,'' including hotel rooms, rental apartments or offices.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, ''the prestige and financial strength of Random House persuaded us that office use was the best way to go,'' Mr. Wine said. He added that the mix of uses was ideal for the neighborhood, given the emergence of Broadway in the 40's and 50's as an entertainment, media and corporate corridor.</p>
        <p>Because of the Park Imperial's location, Ms. Sunshine said, the apartments have drawn interest from the buyers for whom it was intended: empty-nesters and professional singles and couples. She said there was also strong interest from foreign buyers.</p>
        <p>The developers say that in addition to its views, the Park Imperial's contemporary style will help distinguish it from the crop of condominiums, many designed to resemble prewar buildings, being built for prosperous buyers. The building's facade, designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, will be clad in a reflective glass curtain wall. It will have a rectangular base and will be topped by a setback residential tower with a sawtoothed silhouette.</p>
        <p>Because of the eight-cornered shape of the tower, the apartments, designed by Ismael Leyva, a Manhattan architect, will lend themselves to distinctive layouts. Along with high ceilings, all the units will have galleries and central foyers and most will have at least two corner glass walls.</p>
        <p>Related has also hired the interior designer Adam D. Tihany, whose work includes Le Cirque 2000, to design the building's lobby, which will feature curved wood walls, a frosted bronze mirror and a terrazzo floor with onyx inlays. Mr. Tihany is also designing the Imperial Club, a business, entertainment and fitness center for residents. Other planned amenities include valet service and garage parking for 100 cars.</p>
