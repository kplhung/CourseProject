        <p>As a familiar sinking sensation began to seep in, Pete Sampras was standing in the middle of Arthur Ashe Stadium on Wednesday night in need of a trap door to escape from the seemingly unconquerable Richard Krajicek.</p>
        <p>Against a player he had beaten only three times in nine matches, Sampras found himself down a set and in a dark 2-6 chasm during the second-set tie breaker of his quarterfinal match.

        <p>As a familiar sinking sensation began to seep in, Pete Sampras was standing in the middle of Arthur Ashe Stadium on Wednesday night in need of a trap door to escape from the seemingly unconquerable Richard Krajicek.</p>
        <p>Against a player he had beaten only three times in nine matches, Sampras found himself down a set and in a dark 2-6 chasm during the second-set tie breaker of his quarterfinal match. So he did the only thing he could do. As Krajicek served for the set -- and a nearly impossible two-set lead to overcome -- Sampras blindly stabbed at whatever moved.</p>
        <p>''I thought I was gone,'' Sampras said. ''Being down, two sets to love, I wasn't going to quit, but I felt like it was a big hole to get out of.''</p>
        <p>With instincts, reflexes and a lot of luck, Sampras slowly scrambled back to life. At 2-6 in the tie breaker, Sampras came up with a delicate drop volley. In the face of Krajicek's pounding serve, Sampras lunged at the blur down the middle and mis-hit it for a winner in front of his stunned opponent. To finish off a string of six points, Sampras punctuated Krajicek's misery by punching a forehand return into the corner for a winner. He took the tie breaker, 8-6, and had the second set under his belt.</p>
        <p>It was like Wimbledon all over again. In a second-set tie breaker against Patrick Rafter in the final, Sampras was on the verge of extinction when he staged a remarkable comeback.</p>
        <p>''It was like a carbon copy of Wimbledon,'' Sampras said. ''After that, I kind of raised my level. Richard got maybe a touch down. I started playing a little better.''</p>
        <p>He was home free from there, on his way to a 4-6, 7-6 (6), 6-4, 6-2 victory. The fourth-seeded Sampras, the highest seeded player remaining, will play ninth-seeded Lleyton Hewitt tomorrow in the semifinals.</p>
