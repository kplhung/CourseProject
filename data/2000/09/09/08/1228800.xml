        <p>One of the pleasures of an end-of-summer vacation is unessential reading.

In my case, one of those I'll-get-around-to-it books has been ''Last Train to Memphis,'' Peter Guralnick's well-reviewed biography of the young Elvis Presley. It has been on my shelf since its publication in 1994, and a few weeks ago my musician son wanted to borrow it for an upcoming road trip. Thus prodded, I bought him a new copy and took my own long-neglected book along on a Maine vacation.</p>
        <p>There was something oddly relaxing yet stimulating about revisiting those steamy Memphis summers and long-ago Mississippi River nights from the vantage point of an austere Northern coast.

        <p>One of the pleasures of an end-of-summer vacation is unessential reading. I'm not talking about the melt-in-the-mind bonbons called ''beach books,'' but those more ambitious and alluring books that linger on the shelf from year to year, only to be pushed aside again and again by volumes that seem more essential to one's workaday life. In my case, one of those I'll-get-around-to-it books has been ''Last Train to Memphis,'' Peter Guralnick's well-reviewed biography of the young Elvis Presley. It has been on my shelf since its publication in 1994, and a few weeks ago my musician son wanted to borrow it for an upcoming road trip. Thus prodded, I bought him a new copy and took my own long-neglected book along on a Maine vacation.</p>
        <p>There was something oddly relaxing yet stimulating about revisiting those steamy Memphis summers and long-ago Mississippi River nights from the vantage point of an austere Northern coast. The most sobering surprise for me, as a journalist, was that even in the era of segregation, Southern newspaper writers exhibited a surer grasp of what Presley was creating -- a new transracial synthesis in American popular music -- than did the New York critics quoted in the book. The latter concentrated on the sexual threat of his hip movements, the hoodlum symbolism of his ducktail hairdo, and the supposed limitations of one of the century's great vocal instruments.</p>
        <p>Back home, a number of writers had already observed with a surprising lack of prejudice that ''our homegrown hillbilly singer'' was fusing Nashville music with vocal and instrumental licks picked up from B. B. King, Rufus Thomas, Arthur Crudup and other black musicians. I was also struck by the fact that from the first day of his national fame, Presley freely acknowledged his musical debt. ''The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I'm doin' now, man, for more years than I know,'' he told The Charlotte Observer in 1956. ''I got it from them.''</p>
        <p>Peter Guralnick has something to teach about the biographer's problem in writing about those American geniuses who burst upon us with culture-changing force, then dissipate their gifts in lives of self-parody. One thinks, in a literary context, of how Carlos Baker's essential biography, ''Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story,'' is distorted by the author's animosity toward the paranoid, posturing Hemingway of the final years. Albert Goldman's ''Elvis,'' published in 1981, exhibited a striking authorial condescension for its subject.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Guralnick, by focusing on the early years of naive brilliance, re-creates that period described with Fitzgeraldian grace in Variety in 1957 by Hal Kanter, a screenwriter assigned to hang out with Presley and help launch his movie career. The Presley story, he said, is that of ''the young man with the ancient eyes and the child's mouth . . . [who]  awoke from the nightmare of poverty to find the brilliant sun of Fame suddenly burst in his eyes.''</p>
        <p>Another aspect of reading for pleasure rather than purpose is that one encounters unexpected connections. The description of Vernon Presley, the singer's father, as a ''taciturn, suspicious man'' comfortable only in the family's ''private world'' rang a couple of bells. I remembered the description of Albert Gore Sr. in ''The Prince of Tennessee,'' by David Maraniss and Ellen Nakashima, as a man ''with that distant look in his eye.'' ''It's a mountain thing,'' observed a family friend, who purported to see the same Appalachian remoteness in Vice President Gore. What connections, if any, I wondered, could be drawn between the hereditary political prince and the self-invented king of rock 'n' roll, between a sort-of Tennessee mountaineer and a deep-dyed son of the Southern flatlands?</p>
        <p>To be sure, the younger men lived in an era when the outsider mentality that so powerfully shaped their Southern fathers -- both the ne'er-do-well Vernon Presley and the relentlessly striving Al Gore Sr. -- has been subjected to powerful forces of cultural nationalization, including, as it happens, rock music. Yet a literary visit to 50's Memphis -- to the white musicians in the Sun Records studios and the black blues shouters along Beale Street -- carries a message that can also be gleaned from a week's sojourn among the persistently laconic residents of modern-day Maine. Distinctive regional differences do endure as factors in a nation that may be getting smarter about celebrating and preserving them. Those differences seem interwoven somehow with the quintessentially American mystery of true genius emerging from as unlikely a place as East Tupelo, Miss.</p>
