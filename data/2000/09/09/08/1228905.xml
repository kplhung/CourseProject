        <p>KRIPKE-Dorothy. The entire Jewish Theological Seminary community mourns with sorrow the death of Dorothy Kripke, a JTS graduate, rebbetzin and children's boo k author. Dorothy and Rabbi Myer Kripke were married at JTS in 1937. In 1996, she and her husband donated $7 Million to restore and renovate JTS's library tower, destroyed by fire in 1966. Their gift resulted from a modest nest-egg investment she encourged her husband to make with financier Warren Buffet, a friend from the Omaha, Nebraska neighborhood where they had settled. Dedicated to building a Jewish home and community far from her native New York, she is survived by her husband and their three children, Saul of New Jersey, Madeline of New York and Netta Stern of Connecticut, son-in-law Yossi Stern and two grandchildren. May her memory be for a blessing. Ismar Schorsch, Chancellor Gershon Kekst, Board Chairman</p>
