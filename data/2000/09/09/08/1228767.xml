        <p>Chinese culture minister, Sun Jiazheng, in New York for UN summit meeting, says that there are two sides to global culture and that, while China has opened up its cultural market, its market economic system is but newly established; trumpets foreign investment opportunities in China's electronic media, but stresses that Internet and other sectors will have to open gradually, with government monitoring of content (M)</p>

        <p>For Sun Jiazheng, the Chinese culture minister, the emergence of a global culture wears many faces. On the one hand, moviegoers in Beijing can swoon at screenings of ''Titanic.'' On the other, computer jockeys in Shanghai might surf Web sites that carry ''unhealthy'' material.</p>
        <p>''I would say that to a considerable extent, China has opened up its cultural market,'' Mr. Sun said in a speech on Wednesday night at the Museum of Television and Radio in Midtown Manhattan. ''However, China's market economic system is newly established, and its cultural industry with a market mechanism has just started to take shape. Therefore, we face both opportunities and real tough challenges.''</p>

        <p>For Sun Jiazheng, the Chinese culture minister, the emergence of a global culture wears many faces. On the one hand, moviegoers in Beijing can swoon at screenings of ''Titanic.'' On the other, computer jockeys in Shanghai might surf Web sites that carry ''unhealthy'' material.</p>
        <p>''I would say that to a considerable extent, China has opened up its cultural market,'' Mr. Sun said in a speech on Wednesday night at the Museum of Television and Radio in Midtown Manhattan. ''However, China's market economic system is newly established, and its cultural industry with a market mechanism has just started to take shape. Therefore, we face both opportunities and real tough challenges.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sun, in an interview after the speech, trumpeted foreign investment opportunities in China's electronic media, but emphasized that certain sectors, particularly the Internet industry, would have to open up ''gradually'' and with continued government monitoring of content.</p>
        <p>As part of the Chinese delegation to the United Nations summit meeting, Mr. Sun was giving his talk in celebration of an agreement that permits the museum to acquire programming from the Chinese government's audiovisual archives. He was introduced to the audience by Henry A. Kissinger, former secretary of state.</p>
        <p>At its heart, Mr. Sun's speech heralded China's impending entry into the World Trade Organization and called for foreign investment in the country's media infrastructure, from opening theater chains to distributing videotapes and music recordings. One example of openness, he said, is that China will soon import 20 American movies a year instead of 10.</p>
        <p>At the same time, foreign cultural materials would be allowed into the country only ''as long as they abide by Chinese laws and regulations, and cater to the tastes of the Chinese people,'' Mr. Sun said.</p>
        <p>The last decade has seen a gradual emergence of civil society in China, with an attendant rise in forms of cultural expression not sponsored by the state. Punk bands perform at nightclubs, guerrilla filmmaking is not uncommon, and experimental painters have toured their exhibitions abroad. Yet, the government continues to try to exercise control over the media, occasionally shutting down journals and asking prize-winning directors to cut their movies.</p>
        <p>The booming new media industry is an especially sensitive area, given the growing number of Internet users -- more than 17 million -- and the anarchic nature of the medium. Mr. Sun said that the government was working on a policy that would encourage growth, but that officials had not settled on details. Americans have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into start-up enterprises, even though government rules sometimes keep the Internet companies mired in paperwork.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I believe that the development of the Internet is definitely, absolutely a good thing,'' Mr. Sun said. But ''the content contained in the Internet is mixed,'' he said. ''The Chinese government has called attention to this development, the fact that there exists some unhealthy content on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Except for pointing to pornography, Mr. Sun did not specify what might be deemed unhealthy. The government continues to block access to certain Web sites, including those of several foreign news outlets, even though many savvy computer users can get around the firewalls. This summer, the government announced that local officials would start Internet surveillance units and track down people who post political dissents. The authorities have made several arrests in the last few months for such offenses.</p>
