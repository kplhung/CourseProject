        <p>Qwest Communications, a fast-growing provider of telecommunications services, said yesterday that it would lay off nearly 13,000 employees and increase capital spending in an effort to heighten efficiency after its $44 billion acquisition of U S West.</p>
        <p>The company, which is based in Denver, will cut 11,000 staff employees, more than 15 percent of its work force, and 1,800 contractors, although it was not clear which geographic regions would be hardest hit by the layoffs.

        <p>Qwest Communications, a fast-growing provider of telecommunications services, said yesterday that it would lay off nearly 13,000 employees and increase capital spending in an effort to heighten efficiency after its $44 billion acquisition of U S West.</p>
        <p>The company, which is based in Denver, will cut 11,000 staff employees, more than 15 percent of its work force, and 1,800 contractors, although it was not clear which geographic regions would be hardest hit by the layoffs. The cuts will mainly affect nonunion and middle-management positions, the company said.</p>
        <p>Qwest's capital spending will amount to $9 billion this year and $9.5 billion in 2001, figures that surpass Wall Street estimates by as much as $1.5 billion. The company expects revenue of $18.8 billion to $19.1 billion this year and $21.3 billion to $21.7 billion next year. The revenue estimates are only marginally better than expected.</p>
        <p>Though investors are usually enamored of companies that trim their work forces to cut costs, traders were apparently shaken by concern that Qwest's unexpected growth in capital spending would not correspond to a healthy increase in cash flow. The stock fell $2, or almost 4 percent, to $49.44 in heavy trading.</p>
        <p>Until yesterday, Qwest had escaped the malaise that has gripped investor sentiment in the telecommunications industry in recent months because the company was considered to have less exposure to the squeeze in revenue from traditional long-distance operations.  Qwest has largely focused on fast-growing areas like Web site operation and high-speed Internet access.</p>
        <p>Qwest, with 71,000 employees, operates a data and voice network spanning more than 150 cities in the United States and Mexico. In addition, the company gained about 25 million local phone service customers in 14 states after buying U S West.</p>
        <p>Even with the drop yesterday, Qwest shares have risen 13.4 percent  this year, compared with declines of 42.4 percent in WorldCom and 40 percent in AT&amp;T, the nation's largest telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>''Qwest took the market by surprise with a barrage of announcements that investors need time to analyze,'' said Brian Hayward, who manages the $3.6 billion Invesco Telecommunications Fund in Denver. ''We're in wait-and-see mode, where the best stock in its peer group is coming under pressure.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, the combination of Qwest, a company that is at the forefront of the changes washing over the telecommunications industry, with U S West, a slower-growing company that was considered something of a laggard even when compared with its Baby Bell counterparts, was not expected to be completed without glitches.</p>
        <p>''Digesting U S West is not a simple task,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent telecommunications analyst. ''Qwest is still intent on being disruptive to its competitors.''</p>
