        <p>Statistics from a widely used federal database show that fatal crashes involving Ford Explorers were almost three times as likely to be tire related as fatal crashes involving other sport utility vehicles. But Ford, Firestone and federal safety regulators said this week that they never detected the pattern in the data, which might have provided an early warning of problems with Firestone's tires for sport utilities.</p>
        <p>The discrepancy emerged in an analysis by The New York Times of data from the Department of Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System. It showed that from 1995 through 1998, the most recent year available, fatal crashes involving Explorers were 2.8 times as likely to list tires as a contributing factor as those involving other S.U.V.'s.</p>
        <p>In Congressional testimony on Wednesday, the two companies and officials of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said that they looked at a variety of databases without spotting the tire flaw now blamed for 88 deaths in rollovers.</p>
        <p>Firestone documents obtained by Congressional investigators, meanwhile, show that officials of the tire maker were briefed as early as February about rising warranty costs for the tires recalled last month. Company executives had testified Wednesday that Firestone's data on warranty claims did not show a problem with the tires. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>Jacques Nasser, Ford's president and chief executive, testified late Wednesday night at a House subcommittee hearing that even after replacing Firestone tires in Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Venezuela, Ford held off taking action in the United States last year because its review of various databases assured the company -- wrongly, as it turned out -- that there was not a problem here.</p>
        <p>''We are a data-driven company,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When asked by Representative Bart Stupak, a Democrat of Michigan, what information the company had to support its actions overseas, Mr. Nasser replied: ''Anecdotal data.'' He added, ''There is no data in those countries.''</p>
        <p>Ford said it also looked through its data on consumer complaints to the company itself and its dealers. But the number of complaints was low, rising to a peak of 10 in 1998. Company officials said that since Ford routinely directed its customers with tire problems to the tire manufacturers, the small numbers were not surprising. Mr. Nasser said Ford planned to work more closely with the tire industry to detect problems earlier.</p>
        <p>The Department of Transportation database is one of the few tools by which the government can independently track defects that cause fatal accidents. With its budget tightened, the highway safety agency over the years has pulled back from collecting anecdotal evidence from garages and body shops.</p>
        <p>Yet patterns in the government data are not always obvious. The Fatality Analysis Reporting System records approximately 40,000 deaths a year, and, as various witnesses pointed out in this week's hearings, the simple fact that people die in accidents where tires may be a factor is not noteworthy.</p>
        <p>Sue Bailey, the administrator of the highway safety agency, said, for example, that if the database showed a single seat belt failure, her agency would immediately start an investigation, because seat belts are expected never to fail. But, she said, ''tires do fail; if you run your tires for 40,000 miles, there's a certain expected failure rate.''</p>
        <p>And until the recall of 15-inch Firestone ATX, ATX II and certain Wilderness AT tires was announced early last month, she noted, the agency had received only about 5 complaints a year concerning the tires out of 50,000 complaints of all kinds about vehicles.</p>
        <p>Looking at the discrepancy between tire-related fatalities involving Explorers and those involving other sport utility vehicles ''cracked the code,'' said Ernie Grush, Ford's manager of safety data analysis, after being told of the findings by The Times.</p>
        <p>But examining the data without a clear idea of what it contains is much harder than finding clues once a problem is known.</p>
        <p>There were just 35 tire-related fatal crashes involving Explorers in the 1995-98 period, as counted by The Times. Mr. Grush pointed out that compared with the number of miles driven by Explorers by the end of 1998, about 120 billion, the number of deaths was extremely small -- about 0.03 per hundred million miles.</p>
        <p>That represents a small fraction of the deaths in Explorers because of rollovers -- about 0.6 per hundred million miles. It is a smaller fraction yet of all fatalities in Explorers -- about 1 per hundred million miles.</p>
        <p>Among the limitations of the federal database, Mr. Grush and others noted, is that it records only vehicle type, not tire type. The data points to a problem with Firestone tires only because the vast majority of new Explorers were equipped with Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Further supporting the conclusion is an analysis by The Times of the federal data on tire-related deaths in Explorers produced in 1996 and 1997. Explorers built at Ford's Louisville plant were equipped with Goodyear tires in 1996 and Firestones the next year. Ford's St. Louis plant did the opposite.</p>
        <p>The fatality database shows that Ford found that there were nine fatal accidents involving Explorers from the plants using Firestone tires and one from the plants using Goodyear tires. An analysis by Ford confirmed these findings.</p>
        <p>The federal data shows no tire-related fatalities involving Explorers from 1991 to 1993 and a steadily increasing number thereafter, which may reflect that tread separation becomes more common as tires age. The Explorer was introduced at the end of 1990, as a 1991 model.</p>
        <p>For the years 1995 through 1998, the federal database shows, there were 17.8 tire-related fatal accidents for every 1,000 such accidents involving Explorers. For all other sport utility vehicles, there were 6.4 tire-related fatal accidents per 1,000 accidents; the number for cars was 6.0 tire-related fatal accidents.</p>
        <p>Safety experts lament that there is only limited data on a category of crashes that is probably six to eight times the size of the one tracked by the Department of Transportation -- those that cause injuries but no deaths. A yet larger category is crashes with property damage but no injury. Trends could be obvious sooner by using larger databases, experts say.</p>
        <p>''Fatals are investigated very thoroughly,'' said Stephanie Faul, a spokeswoman for the American Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety. ''Property damage crashes are hardly investigated at all.''</p>
        <p>One source for such data is insurance companies. State Farm, the nation's largest automobile insurer, contacted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration several times last year about tire failures, according to Samuel Boyden, the company's associate research director, who testified at Wednesday's House hearing. But the agency did not follow up on the contacts.</p>
        <p>Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who presided at the hearing, suggested that the government agency should make better use of insurance data.</p>
