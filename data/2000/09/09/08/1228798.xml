        <p>Dozens of people with AIDS have been turned away from emergency housing despite a November court order that requires the city to provide such shelter, homeless people and their advocates told a City Council hearing yesterday.</p>
        <p>One homeless man with AIDS, who identified himself only as Greg E., told the Council's General Welfare Committee that he spent five days on the street after being sent to the city's Division of AIDS Services and Income Support by a nursing center on Aug. 15.</p>
        <p>''I waited all day and they told me that they didn't have a place,'' he said. ''I told the lady there, 'I have no place to go, where am I going to sleep?' She told me that's 'all we can do; we don't have a place,' so I slept by the steps on 161st Street.''</p>
        <p>But the city's lawyers and the Human Resources Administration, which is responsible for providing such housing, say that all homeless people with AIDS are being served appropriately.</p>
        <p>Debra Sproles, a spokeswoman for the agency, said in a statement that the agency's AIDS housing division ''continues to provide emergency housing placement to all eligible homeless clients on the same day of the request.'' She did not return several calls seeking additional comment.</p>
        <p>In a letter sent to the Council committee, Mark Hoover, the administration's first deputy commissioner, said 85 percent of the AIDS housing division's 27,142 clients needed help with housing, including rental assistance. Last year, the division received 14,141 requests for emergency housing and made 13,607 referrals. Of those, more than a third failed to show at the locations given them, he said.</p>
        <p>But Councilwoman Christine Quinn said that despite assertions that it had been providing the required shelter, in recent weeks the city had failed in its efforts.</p>
        <p>She told the council that last Friday, 11 AIDS clients were assigned to a hotel, only to find they were given the wrong address and had to spend Labor Day weekend on the street. She added that this Tuesday at 9:20 p.m., the Division of AIDS Services assigned 10 clients to the Best Western Seaport Inn in Lower Manhattan, but that three of the clients were forced to sleep outside when the hotel said that it had not received their names.</p>
        <p>In a later interview, Councilwoman Quinn said: ''What we're saying is, over the past two to three weeks, something has changed. The crisis has occurred. I also think it is illustrative of the overall problem in H.R.A.,'' she said, that the only potential problem that the agency points out ''is one that would be caused by the clients.''</p>
        <p>In a strongly worded decision last November, the courts ruled that the city must provide housing for people with AIDS the same day they request it, instead of within 24 hours, the time frame under which the city had been operating. In her ruling, Justice Emily Jane Goodman of State Supreme Court said that ''a night on the streets for persons living with our modern plague of AIDS is medically inappropriate.'' She said that a 1997  city law calling for ''medically appropriate housing'' required the Division of AIDS Services to provide immediate shelter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoover's letter to the Council yesterday, however, reverted to the city's former position in its wording, saying that ''all eligible clients seeking emergency housing assistance have been served within 24 hours in compliance with the law.'' He was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>Last week, the city announced that it would appeal Justice Goodman's November ruling. Leonard Koerner, chief of appeals for the city's legal department, said that the city had asked for an additional month, beyond the nine months it was given, to complete its appeal. He said the small number of homeless people with AIDS who were not given a more permanent place to stay were given hotel rooms.</p>
        <p>''We will send someone out to a hotel room, not to a park bench, because we believe philosophically that someone should be placed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As of 6:15 p.m. yesterday, Karen Pena, a caseworker who represents a client of the Division of AIDS Services, said it looked as though 7 out of 11 people waiting for emergency housing at one of the human resources agency's Manhattan offices would be served, while 4 most likely would not.</p>
        <p>Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, chairman of the General Welfare Committee, has planned another City Council hearing for Sept. 28. ''We're going to try to get to the bottom of this,'' he said. ''Our obligation to offer assistance to people who are clearly qualified for that is something we need to take seriously.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 14, 2000, Thursday  An article on Friday about a hearing of the New York City Council's General Welfare Committee, at which homeless people with AIDS testified that they had been turned away from emergency shelters, misstated the date of a second hearing scheduled on the complaints. It is Sept. 29, not Sept. 28.</p>
