        <p>ROBINSON-Roger ''Robbie'' Wolcott, age 83, who retired after thirty-seven years as a Special Agent and Supervisor of the FBI, died on August 18th of injuries sustained as a passenger in an automobile accident. He lived in Briarcliff Manor, New York. Roger graduated from Duke University and played on the legendary ''Iron Dukes'' Rose Bowl team. During the 1938 season, the team went undefeated, untied and unscored upon. He was primarily assigned to the Bureau's New York office where he worked counter-espionage cases and later served as head of firearms instruction and defensive tactics. Roger won the New York State Pistol Championship four times and was awarded the Distinguished Medal by Congress. His first wife ''Bunny'' (Mary Grace) Pethick died in 1965. Survivors include his wife of 19 years Elly (Cattell), three children from his first marriage: Sandy Robinson, Faye Robinson, Roger Robinson, Jr., a stepdaughter Susan Herring, a daughter-in-law Joan Robinson and grandchildren Grace and Roger III. Friends are invited to a memorial service at the Briarcliff Congregational Church, at South State Road, Briarcliff Manor, on September 16th at 12 noon.</p>
