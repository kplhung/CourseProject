        <p>A selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>''BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL,'' Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 279-4200 until Thursday; after that, (212) 239-6200. If this is not a flawless revue, it is nevertheless an ingratiating tribute to his achievement. Fridays, Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Wednesdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; no show this Monday but an added performance Sunday at 4:30 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>QUEEN ESTHER, Joe's Pub, Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. The artist exudes an impish charm that recalls the sorely missed comedian and performance artist Danitra Vance. But by the end of the show her musical identity remains undefined. Her nondescript versions of ''The Lady Is a Tramp'' and ''Lush Life'' fail to illuminate either the material or her ideas. And when she caps her show with two more vintage lounge songs, ''I've Gotta Be Me'' and ''The Good Life,'' it isn't clear whether she's making fun of them or embracing them. The best moments of ''Unemployed Superstar'' are the nonmusical monologues in which Queen Esther impersonates embittered neighbors she met when she moved to Harlem. Characters like these could form the basis of an unsettling evening of serious political comedy. Tonight at 8:30. Tickets: $12. Also at Joe's Pub, tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Liza Jessie Peterson, singer, in the funk opera ''Chiron's Homegirl Healer Howls'' and new work. Tickets: $12. Sunday at 9 p.m., Eszter Balint, singer and songwriter. Tickets: $10 (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Reprise Room at Dillon's, 245 West 54th Street, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes. He focuses on what he calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, whose creamy baritone echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock concentrates on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves that there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Tonight, Monday and Tuesday nights at 8, tomorrow and Wednesdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m., Sunday nights at 7:30. Tickets: $50 and $55; ringside seating, $75 and $80 (Holden).</p>
