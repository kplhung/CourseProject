        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a mother of four who has a demanding job, I disagree with Cameron Stracher's contention that family-friendly policies and technology hurt families (''Child Care and Other Traps,'' Op-Ed, Sept. 2). Parents simply need to take responsibility for turning off their cell phones and pagers during family time.</p>
        <p>Blending work and family does not have to mean working all the time. Rather, this blending allows for quick transitions between family time and work time during the course of a day.</p>
        <p>A law firm with flexible child care arrangements should be applauded for its efforts. The writer's assertion that ''we can't have it all'' is just another thinly veiled plea for women to stay home.</p>
