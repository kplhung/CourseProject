        <p>In a remote jungle of Guatemala, among the remains of a little-known ancient city with a name meaning Place of Serpents, archaeologists have uncovered one of the largest and most splendid palaces of Maya kings ever discovered. Its 170 high-ceiling rooms were built around 11 courtyards and spread over an area greater than two football fields.</p>
        <p>''No one has found anything like this since the turn of the last century,'' Dr. Arthur A. Demarest, an archaeologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and leader of the discovery team, said yesterday in describing the palace, which dates from the eighth century A.D. ''What is most incredible about this site is that most of the palace is buried virtually intact.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Demarest said that in size and preservation the palace, at Cancuen, rivaled the buildings at the central acropolis in Tikal, one of the grandest seats of Mayan power in Guatemala. Earlier expeditions had either overlooked or underestimated the size and grandeur of the palace and the city around it, a prosperous center of commerce and crafts at the head of navigation on the Pasion River.</p>
        <p>The discovery and the first excavations at Cancuen were made this summer by archaeologists led by Dr. Demarest and Dr. Tomas Barrientos of the Universidad del Valle in Guatemala. The expedition is sponsored by the Guatemalan Institute of Anthropology and History, the National Geographic Society and Vanderbilt.</p>
        <p>''It's an extraordinarily important find,'' said Dr. David Freidel, a Maya studies specialist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, who has no connection to the work. ''It's been a long time since a major palace complex has come to light. A scientific investigation of the ruins should help us understand political life in the late classic period of the Maya.''</p>
        <p>The Maya civilization was at the peak of its power in Central America and Mexico from 250 to 900, known as the classic period. The king who completed the palace -- inscriptions give his name as Tah ak Chaan -- ruled Cancuen for about 50 years, beginning in 740.</p>
        <p>By this time, Dr. Freidel said, the focus of Mayan political life and state ceremony had shifted from the grand outdoor plazas to the palaces, which means that the buildings' art and architecture may reflect the changing relationships of powerful rulers, nobles and allies.</p>
        <p>Even a preliminary study of the site and its inscribed monuments has already produced one surprise: there is no evidence that the city's rulers engaged in any major wars with neighbors. Nor is there any sign of pyramids, the typically spectacular bases for temples and manifestations of the religious roots of a city's power.</p>
        <p>The absence of pyramid temples was the main reason previous archaeologists largely passed by the ruins and failed to investigate the true size of the palace.</p>
        <p>These discoveries alone may cause scholars to reconsider some of their ideas about the Maya civilization, Dr. Demarest said. Here was a city that appeared to prosper for hundreds of years without warfare or the usual display of religion as sources of the power of Maya kings, particularly toward the end of their dominance.</p>
        <p>''I have a book in press that I'll have to revise,'' Dr. Demarest remarked.</p>
        <p>Unlike other Maya cities, Cancuen appeared to use its strategic position at the foot of the highlands, a source of jade, obsidian and other valuable commodities, to become a commercial power throughout the lowlands. Dr. Demarest said the city must have been larger, richer and more powerful than anyone had expected. Its rulers appeared to have been single-mindedly dedicated to commerce.</p>
        <p>Some of the first excavations of residences disclosed that the city had a relatively wealthy middle class and many workshops for artisans producing elite goods for trade far and wide.</p>
        <p>Jade is everywhere at the site, Dr. Demarest said. A young middle-class woman was found in her grave with 10 jade inlaid teeth. Workmen were buried with fine ceramic figurines with beautiful headdresses. At a workshop lay a 35-pound chunk of jade, which artisans had been slicing for pieces to manufacture ornaments.</p>
        <p>Other excavations turned up large amounts of pyrite, commonly known as fool's gold. Thin sheets of it were being used in making mirrors, one of the more prized possessions of the elite.</p>
        <p>All this might never have been uncovered if Dr. Demarest had not literally fallen into the discovery of the palace.</p>
        <p>After a decade of excavations at Dos Pilas and other sites in northern Guatemala, where he found ample evidence of a highly militaristic city-state called Petexbatun, Dr. Demarest decided last year to visit Cancuen to follow up a lead. Members of his team had found records of a marriage alliance between a Dos Pilas prince and a Cancuen princess. She then came to Dos Pilas to live in her own small palace.</p>
        <p>Seeing the architecture and crafts of Cancuen, Dr. Demarest said, ''It looks as if the princess brought her own artisans, because the stonework on her palace is just like that at Cancuen and far superior to anything in the Petexbatun region.''</p>
        <p>Then the archaeologists looked more closely at the ruins of what turned out to be the royal palace. ''To the untrained eye, the palace looks just like a great, jungle-covered hill,'' Dr. Demarest said.</p>
        <p>While walking along the ruin's highest level, Dr. Demarest fell up to his armpits into vegetation filling one of the courtyards. ''That's when I realized the entire hill was a three-story building and we were walking on top of the roof,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So far, archaeologists have only dug test holes into the palace ruins, enough to estimate the dimensions of the building. The walls are built of solid limestone. They enclose a densely packed labyrinth of rooms with 20-foot-high corbel-arched ceilings. The team's leaders estimate it will take at least 10 years to excavate and partly restore the palace.</p>
        <p>They are making plans to deploy a larger team of researchers and excavators at the site next February, at the end of the rainy season. The region is free of civil war now, Dr. Demarest said, but the government of Guatemala has little presence there, and it is still a virtually lawless place.</p>
        <p>Dr. Demarest said the expedition has mobilized and trained the people of the nearest village, El Zapote, to stand guard over the new-found palace.</p>
