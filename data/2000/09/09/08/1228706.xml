        <p>Famous for gathering the Hollywood elite at San Simeon, his California estate, the press baron William Randolph Hearst was once asked why he didn't devote himself fully to movies rather than journalism. ''He said: 'You can crush a man with journalism, but not with motion pictures.' That was his answer,'' Douglas Fairbanks Jr. says in the documentary ''The Battle Over Citizen Kane.'' Released on tape this week by WGBH Boston Video, the 1996 Academy Award-nominated film depicts two gifted egomaniacs in the process of discovering that, whether by movie or newspaper, those most damaged could include themselves.</p>
        <p>Produced and directed by Thomas Lennon and Michael Epstein, the film, made by WGBH and shown on PBS's ''American Experience,'' skillfully interweaves the gigantic personalities of both Hearst and Orson Welles, the 24-year-old whose 1941 film starring himself as the Hearst-like Charles Foster Kane still defines Hearst in the minds of most Americans.</p>
        <p>''For the first time ever, the methods Hearst had used to lay bare the lives of others had been used on him,'' a commentator says in the documentary.</p>
        <p>Being portrayed ultimately as a brooding, isolated wreck, which he never was, bothered Hearst, but he was primarily incensed over Welles's depiction of his companion, the actress Marion Davies, as a featherbrained drunk. Hearst tried to suppress the film by branding Welles as a Communist and a homosexual, among other things. Then he tried to have the movie destroyed.</p>
        <p>Welles didn't scare easily, or at all. In 1938 his radio broadcast ''War of the Worlds'' and its invading Martians panicked the country and left Welles, then 22, wondering if the fall-out would destroy his career. ''It was the only time I worked with Orson that I saw him slightly afraid,'' one associate says.</p>
        <p>In fact, the furor greatly bolstered Welles's reputation and landed him in Hollywood with a large contract. ''Citizen Kane'' was his first film. ''He always lived phenomenally dangerously,'' Mr. Lennon said in an interview. ''Flying into controversy was Welles's method.''</p>
        <p>But the portrayal of Davies was a mistake. In the documentary Fairbanks calls her a delight, ''full of wit, humor, a glorious gal.'' Welles, speaking in the film in 1982, three years before his death, says the depiction was ''something of a dirty trick.''</p>
        <p>In the documentary, Herman Mankiewicz, the co-screenwriter of ''Citizen Kane, is labeled as Welles's partner in mischief. ''I think they thought they could get away with it,'' says William Alland, a Welles colleague.  ''I don't think they realized how touchy the old man was and this was Hollywood and there would be hell to pay.''</p>
        <p>But even that would be all right. ''If Hearst sued that would be great,'' Mr. Alland continues. ''The film would be news everywhere. They'd drive the old man crazy, turn the town on its ear.''</p>
        <p>Welles's career never fully recovered from Hearst's onslaught, which had lasting repercussions at the studios. Mr. Lennon said that his own film was criticized for implying that ''Citizen Kane'' essentially finished Welles. ''His career wasn't over by 25,'' he said, ''but it was limited in a way that haunted him for the rest of his life.''</p>
        <p>New Video Releases</p>
        <p>Mission to Mars</p>
        <p>Washed out of a mission to Mars for psychiatric reasons, Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise, left, with Connie Nielsen) gets his chance later when the astronauts run into problems with a huge human face they find embedded in the red planet. The commander of a rescue attempt figures he needs a man of McConnell's experience along. Brian De Palma's film reaches for the great unexplainable out there, but, Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times, ''it has been a long time since such a grandiloquent souffle of majesty and silliness refused to rise on the big screen.''</p>
        <p>2000. Touchstone. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 113 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release date: Sept. 12.</p>
        <p>East Is East</p>
        <p>In 1971, George Khan (Om Puri), the Pakistani owner of an English fish-and-chips shop, battles to justify his traditionalist and often brutal ways with a brood of seven children. Rebellion turns George into a raging patriarch, but Damien O'Donnell's film shies away from religious and cultural complexities in what becomes basically a sitcom. When George's rage blows the film apart, ''Mr. O'Donnell's attempts to restore its tone of easygoing farce seem awkward, even insensitive'' (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>2000. Miramax. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 96 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Sept. 12.</p>
        <p>The Quarry</p>
        <p>In remote South African landscapes, tortured souls with generic names like the Man and the Woman face daunting human and political issues. After murdering a clergyman who made advances toward him, the Man (John Lynch) takes up the minister's duties in a small village, where he boards in the house of the Woman (Sylvia Esau). The Woman, who is black, is having an affair with a white policeman, who subsequently arrests a poor black man for the killing. For all its susceptibility to symbolic interpretations of God, justice and race, Marion Hansel's film is a ''first-rate venture into mystery and suspense'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>2000. First Run. $79.95. 112 minutes. No rating. Release date: Sept. 12.</p>
        <p>Stiff Upper Lips</p>
        <p>Gary Sinyor's film struggles with what appears to be a long overdue and surefire idea: a sendup of Jane Austen, Merchant-Ivory style dramas set among the English upper classes. It's 1908, and Aunt Agnes (Prunella Scales) is desperate to marry off her niece Emily (Georgina Cates) to the pompous Cedric (Robert Portal). Lower-class blokes take a hand, but as the film ''stumbles along, its humor is so scattershot, its tone so wobbly and its casting so uneven, that the movie never coheres'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Miramax. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 85 minutes. No rating. Release date: Sept. 12.</p>
