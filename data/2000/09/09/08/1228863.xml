        <p>The Yonkers school system has announced that it will eliminate bus service for about 2,000 students, prompting leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to charge that the move violates a court-ordered desegregation plan that has controlled the schools there for 14 years.</p>
        <p>The Yonkers mayor and school board have been seeking a settlement that would end the court's oversight of the system.

        <p>The Yonkers school system has announced that it will eliminate bus service for about 2,000 students, prompting leaders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to charge that the move violates a court-ordered desegregation plan that has controlled the schools there for 14 years.</p>
        <p>The Yonkers mayor and school board have been seeking a settlement that would end the court's oversight of the system. But the decision to cut the buses for nearly one-tenth of the system's 23,000 students, which school officials said was intended to help cut traffic congestion, seemed to aggravate the already heated discussions in Yonkers about whether the schools treat minority students fairly.</p>
        <p>Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan, who has overseen the case, demanded an explanation for the decision earlier this week after the court-appointed monitor in the case, Joseph M. Pastore Jr., warned the school district that absent a valid reason, the elimination of buses violated the court order.</p>
        <p>Before the cuts, the city provided buses only for students who lived more than one and a half miles away from their schools. But the court order dictated that the system offer busing to all students in the city's 10 magnet schools, which were set up under the court order as well. Any change in the order requires the court's approval.</p>
        <p>Joe Farmer, the interim superintendent of schools, said that Mr. Pastore and the local chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., which brought the original desegregation lawsuit, had agreed to the change in magnet school busing policy in meetings as far back as 1996, and again in meetings this June and July. Parents were told of the change last November and in recent letters in English and Spanish.</p>
        <p>The superintendent said the buses were eliminated because, with 255 buses on the streets in commuter traffic, students were arriving to school about an hour late.</p>
        <p>''The density of the buses reached a profound level, and we couldn't get the kids to school on time,'' he said. ''It's important for kids to get to school on time.''</p>
        <p>The decision cuts the number of buses to roughly 175.</p>
        <p>The N.A.A.C.P. said the announcement surprised many parents, and would only complicate negotiations on eliminating federal oversight.</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of intransigence and unilateral behavior that is pushing us further away from a settlement,'' said Leonard Buddington, president of the Yonkers N.A.A.C.P. chapter. ''All of these things were done without the involvement of the federal court monitor or the court. This is the very pattern that resulted in the need to file a lawsuit to begin with.''</p>
