        <p>''Of all the bad guys in the picture he's like a good guy,'' said James Caan, talking about his role as a veteran troubleshooter for a mob lawyer in ''The Way of the Gun.'' ''If there's anybody who has any kind of moral backbone, it's him, because he's caught in a dilemma between serving his boss and taking care of his boss's daughter.''</p>
        <p>The good bad guy has been a Caan specialty since he played Sonny Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 classic ''The Godfather.'' As an actor he has always been willing to blend his immense, almost boyish charm with a sense of contained violence, suggesting something darker behind the bright smile and accommodating patter. ''You see that this guy has been through the wars,'' said Mr. Caan. ''And yet he's just really calm and cool. He's done all the footwork.''</p>

        <p>''Of all the bad guys in the picture he's like a good guy,'' said James Caan, talking about his role as a veteran troubleshooter for a mob lawyer in ''The Way of the Gun.'' ''If there's anybody who has any kind of moral backbone, it's him, because he's caught in a dilemma between serving his boss and taking care of his boss's daughter.''</p>
        <p>The good bad guy has been a Caan specialty since he played Sonny Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 classic ''The Godfather.'' As an actor he has always been willing to blend his immense, almost boyish charm with a sense of contained violence, suggesting something darker behind the bright smile and accommodating patter. ''You see that this guy has been through the wars,'' said Mr. Caan. ''And yet he's just really calm and cool. He's done all the footwork.''</p>
        <p>In ''The Way of the Gun,'' which opens nationally today (review, Page 10), Mr. Caan's character goes up against two punks, played by Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro, who kidnap a young woman (Juliette Lewis) without realizing that she is serving as a surrogate mother for the mob lawyer (Scott Wilson) and his wife (Kristin Lehman). The action builds to a shootout that recalls the films of Sam Peckinpah, for whom Mr. Caan made ''The Killer Elite.'' ''Sam definitely would have done this picture,'' said Mr. Caan, speaking by phone from his home in Utah. ''It's his kind of thing.''</p>
        <p>The writer-director of ''The Way of the Gun'' is Christopher McQuarrie, whose screenplay for ''The Usual Suspects'' won an Oscar in 1996. ''I'm a big fan of his writing,'' Mr. Caan said. ''There was a great 14-page scene, which is basically why I did the movie, between this character of mine and Benicio. A very long scene in a diner, where he's talking about how people today want to be criminals but don't want to commit a crime, they just like the title.''</p>
        <p>With the vagaries of filmmaking, the scene did not make the final cut. But Mr. Caan, who will be back next month in ''The Yards,'' carries no grudges. ''I really enjoyed working with the kids. I call them all kids now, because I'm ancient. God, I just turned 60. I can't even think of that. But I'm still playing basketball with the 25-year-olds, so I just refuse to accept it.''</p>
        <p>LaButian Undertones</p>
        <p>It's been four years since ''In the Company of Men,'' but Neil LaBute still hasn't learned to play his role as America's Most Controversial Filmmaker. He's still the shambling Midwestern nice guy he has always been, even after further heating up the war between the sexes with ''Your Friends and Neighbors'' and ''Bash,'' his collection of one-act plays that was recently shown on cable television.</p>
        <p>Recently Mr. LaBute took two days off from preproduction in London on his latest project, an adaptation of A. S. Byatt's novel ''Possession'' that will star Gwyneth Paltrow, to visit New York on behalf of ''Nurse Betty,'' a romantic comedy  with some dark LaButian undertones that opens nationally today (review, Page 1 of Weekend).</p>
        <p>For Mr. LaBute, who has always written his own films, two adaptations in a row seem like a dramatic departure. ''What it is more than anything is opportunity. Of those first two films, one was generated strictly out of my backyard, and then the other one came off of people seeing that. 'Nurse Betty' came directly out of working on 'Friends and Neighbors,' because Steve Golin produced that, and he had the script and said, 'What do you think of this?' I read it, and I didn't have the time to intellectualize career choices. I told him I liked it and that I couldn't imagine me doing it, and that's probably a good thing.</p>
        <p>''In the theater I directed other people's material, so why shouldn't I direct someone else's script? It was very freeing in many respects not to be so close to something. I could immediately be an audience member, and say, 'This is good; this needs some work,' and not feel that pang of, 'I just gave birth to this, be kind.' ''</p>
        <p>Written by John C. Richards and James Flamberg, ''Nurse Betty'' is the story of a small-town waitress, played by Renee Zellweger, who witnesses the brutal murder of her drug-dealing husband and, traumatized, retreats into a fantasy in which she believes herself engaged to her favorite soap-opera character, a handsome, heroic doctor played by Greg Kinnear. She sets out for Los Angeles, pursued by the two hitmen she had observed, played by Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock.</p>
        <p>''I spent every weekend and every day before we shot working on the dialogue,'' said Mr. LaBute. ''But character-wise, plot-wise, it's very much what the guys wrote.</p>
        <p>''Probably the only thing that sprang from me as a complete idea was Morgan and Chris going to the Grand Canyon at night,'' said Mr. LaBute, referring to the scene in which Mr. Freeman's character reveals that he has fallen in love with the woman he's chasing. ''The idea was that she would imagine something transformative happening to her at the Grand Canyon and then have these guys physically be there and have something similar happen to them. I'm a person who loves to continually thread things back into the hole. That's just the way my mind works.''</p>
        <p>Depardieu Fils</p>
        <p>In France the actor Gerard Depardieu seems well on his way to establishing an acting dynasty, like the Carradines or the Bridgeses in the United States. Both Mr. Depardieu's daughter, Julie, and his son, Guillaume, have embarked on successful acting careers, and they both appeared with their father in the hugely successful French mini-series ''The Count of Monte Cristo.''</p>
        <p>Guillaume, 29, is also the star of Leos Carax's grand, dreamlike adaptation of Herman Melville's 1852 novel ''Pierre, or the Ambiguities.''  Titled ''Pola X,'' it opens in New York today (review, Page 14), two years after its release in France.</p>
        <p>''Pierre was a difficult character to play,'' Guillaume Depardieu said over coffee in a West Side hotel, ''He's someone who descends further and further, marginalizing himself, looking for the truth, and finally he destroys himself.''</p>
        <p>The character is a spoiled son of the haute bourgeoisie who drops out of his comfortable life to become a professional starving poet, while he carries on a passionate affair with a strange young woman from the East (Katerina Golubeva), who may or may not be his half-sister.</p>
        <p>Does Pierre become a great artist as a result of encountering all of this brutal reality? ''Perhaps not,'' said Mr. Depardieu. But why then has he gone through it? ''That, I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Unlike his father, Guillaume is delicate-looking, a slender young man with a self-described ''face of an angel,'' something he resents. ''I would like to play villains,'' he said. ''But no one will cast me with this mug.''</p>
        <p>AT THE MOVIES  Correction:  September 11, 2000, Monday  A picture caption in Weekend on Friday with the At the Movies column misspelled the given name of the actor starring in the French film ''Pola X,'' which opened at the Angelika Film Center. As noted in the article, he is Guillaume Depardieu, not Guillame.</p>
