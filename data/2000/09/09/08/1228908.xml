        <p>MANNING-Arthur A. Died September 4, 2000 after a courageous battle with diabetic complications. Arthur served as a forensic detective in the New York City police department and retired with honors approximately 15 years ago. As a youth, he rose through the ranks of the Boy Scouts serving as a leader and a mentor to the Bronx young men of his home base. He was instrumental in the development of the Ranachqua Foundation, a growing group of scout alumni who attended the Ten Mile River scout camps. The foundation's efforts over the past 60 years provided the funds to send young scouts from the Bronx to the same Camp Ranachqua that they attended when they were their age. Arthur was chairman of the board of directors. Contributions in Arthur's memory may be made to Ranachqua Foundation, 1732 Astor Avenue, Bronx, NY 10469. Memorial service will be held on Monday, September 11, 2000 at 11:30AM at Thomas Montera Funeral Home 1848 Westchester Avenue, Bronx, NY.</p>
