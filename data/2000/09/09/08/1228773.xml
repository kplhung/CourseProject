        <p>Kenny Cambron had the worst luck as a tourist. When he visited the Louvre, he took a wrong turn outside and had to walk around the entire building. At Pompeii, he got off a train near the rear of the ruins and was forced to climb a wall to get in.</p>
        <p>Then yesterday afternoon, Mr. Cambron, from Maui, Hawaii, found himself surrounded by police officers and Secret Service agents outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The occasion: a reception thrown by President Clinton. On the guest list: 150 or so world leaders attending a summit meeting at the United Nations, but definitely not Mr. Cambron. For the first time in at least a quarter-century, the museum had closed its doors for the entire day, turning away about 8,000 tourists.</p>

        <p>Kenny Cambron had the worst luck as a tourist. When he visited the Louvre, he took a wrong turn outside and had to walk around the entire building. At Pompeii, he got off a train near the rear of the ruins and was forced to climb a wall to get in.</p>
        <p>Then yesterday afternoon, Mr. Cambron, from Maui, Hawaii, found himself surrounded by police officers and Secret Service agents outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The occasion: a reception thrown by President Clinton. On the guest list: 150 or so world leaders attending a summit meeting at the United Nations, but definitely not Mr. Cambron. For the first time in at least a quarter-century, the museum had closed its doors for the entire day, turning away about 8,000 tourists.</p>
        <p>''I'd think they could find some other place to have it rather than at the biggest museum in New York,'' Mr. Cambron said. ''But I guess they feel comfortable here. There's a little bit of history from every country.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Cambron ambled off, a couple walked up to the steps, where workers were literally laying out a red carpet.</p>
        <p>''It's closed,'' a police officer told them.</p>
        <p>''But we have to go to Boston tonight,'' said Carolina Moran, who was visiting from El Paso with her husband.</p>
        <p>''Next time,'' the officer said.</p>
        <p>The couple turned to leave, then stopped to watch an honor guard of about two dozen uniformed soldiers practicing their march up the steps. They were not quite as finely chiseled as a Rodin, but they would have to do for this visit.</p>
        <p>Travelers' Tips</p>
        <p>As the last of the lunch patrons at one of Manhattan's most exclusive East Side restaurants paid their bills and headed for the street, the general manager took a seat in the back and reached for a cigarette. And another. And another.</p>
        <p>The waves of diplomats who converged on his world-famous restaurant were tough to please.</p>
        <p>And while restaurant managers across the city felt the burden of demanding figureheads accustomed to being heeded, waiters were schooled in cultural diversity by way of the tip.</p>
        <p>Americans may be thought gauche, but when it comes to tipping, the word behind the counter is that they far outrank the hordes of delegates feasting on steak and pasta between sessions on world peace.</p>
        <p>Western Europeans are reputed to be the least generous, New Yorkers the most. ''They're the chicest, most sophisticated and most flamboyant, and they like to show what they have,'' proclaimed the manager, who did not want to be named lest his analysis ward off customers from the Continent. ''They demand quality and they pay for it.''</p>
        <p>When it comes to the 20 percent rule, ''Europeans are not known to know,'' he said. Pause. ''Or maybe they have chosen not to know. I don't know.'' Russians? ''Pretty good.'' Japanese? Not the best, but because ''in their culture it's insulting to tip,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A manager at Fred's at Barneys New York, Robert Mistretta, begged to differ. Be they Japanese delegates or sightseers, ''it seems like they've studied up on everything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There are advantages to the visiting delegates, said Mr. Mistretta, who yesterday served a family in town for the summit meeting, he thought. While Fred's automatically includes an 18 percent tip for parties of eight or more, this family went above and beyond that. ''They really seemed like they didn't deal with anything less than $100 bills,'' he marveled.  SUMMIT IN NEW YORK: REPORTERS' NOTEBOOK</p>
