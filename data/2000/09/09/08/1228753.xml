        <p>Russia's most flamboyant tycoon aggravated a standoff with President Vladimir V. Putin late today by announcing, as promised, that he is giving away his dominant stake in the nation's largest television network rather than surrender it to Kremlin control.</p>
        <p>Or almost, anyway. The tycoon, Boris Berezovsky, said at a news conference that he was putting his shares in the network, ORT, in trust for the next four years, splitting control among a host of national journalistic and cultural figures. If their stewardship is successful, he said, he will give them a 20 percent stake.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berezovsky did not define success, or say how the network's new stewards, a group he is still choosing, would manage the empire.</p>
        <p>That left outsiders still wondering whether Mr. Berezovsky was just parrying in a continuing power struggle with Mr. Putin, or working to prevent a government takeover of Russia's free press, or both.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berezovsky gave another reason. ''I am tired, tired, tired,'' he said at a news conference. ''It seems to me that alone, I simply cannot carry any longer this load called ORT.''  ORT -- the initials stand for Russian Public Television -- is nominally government-run. But nobody doubts that Mr. Berezovsky, who controls at least 49 percent of its shares, pulls its strings.</p>
        <p>In parliamentary elections last winter, he wielded it as a club on behalf of friends within the Kremlin who were promoting Mr. Putin as the successor to President Boris N. Yeltsin. With ORT's help, Mr. Putin's Unity Party destroyed its opposition, setting the stage for Mr. Yeltsin's surprise resignation and last spring's election of Mr. Putin.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Putin and Mr. Berezovsky have since parted ways. Mr. Berezovsky, who was elected to Parliament last winter, abruptly quit the Legislature this spring to organize a political opposition to the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has opened his own attack against Mr. Berezovsky and other tycoons, focusing government investigators on their business empires in what seems to be a campaign of intimidation.</p>
        <p>It is not clear how much of a role Mr. Putin's ill-concealed contempt for the news media plays in that campaign. Days after his inauguration as president in May, masked police raided the offices of one often-critical press baron, Vladimir Gusinsky, and shortly afterward jailed him. A criminal investigation later was abruptly dropped amid rumors, strongly denied, that Mr. Gusinsky cut a deal with the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Putin has cast the Kremlin's actions as an attempt to free Russia from the grip of rapacious monopolists. In particular, he has suggested that Russia's news media are not truly free because they speak for the rich instead of the ordinary people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has yet to say whether he thinks the government is better qualified to run the news media in the name of ordinary people. When the government's proposed budget for the next fiscal year was released this week, for the first time there was a ''top secret'' classification stamped on all expenditures involving the news media.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Berezovsky, the latest straw appears to have been a demand by the Kremlin this month that he hand over his stake in ORT or suffer Mr. Gusinsky's fate. Mr. Berezovsky today listed 14 men and women who he said had accepted his offer to be ORT trustees, and 9 more who apparently had yet to respond. They include some of the best known and most respected figures in Russian journalism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berezovsky said none of the trustees would be financially responsible for the network, which is reported to have lost money. And he said he was considering a similar plan for his other media holdings,  including Moscow's most powerful business daily newspaper, Kommersant.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin has neither confirmed nor denied that it issued an ultimatum to Mr. Berezovsky. One official said the government had no objection to Mr. Berezovsky's plan to distribute his shares in ORT, providing it was not a sham deal to cover his continued control.</p>
