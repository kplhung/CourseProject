        <p>Attention, jet setters: Better get to Paris next week (if you can find a hotel room). The opening of the French social season begins on Tuesday, when more than 90,000 international collectors -- from the the Prince of Lichtenstein and the Princess of Kent to Baroness Philippine de Rothschild and Quentin Tarantino -- are expected to congregate for a two-week extravaganza of openings, parties and special events connected to the 20th edition of the Biennale International des Antiquaires, the Super Bowl of antiques fairs.</p>
        <p>''As antiques dealers, we are experiencing a fantastic era,'' said Claude Blaizot, president of the National Antiques Dealers Syndicate in France. ''We are witnessing Paris's comeback on the big chessboard, which the international art market represents.''</p>

        <p>Attention, jet setters: Better get to Paris next week (if you can find a hotel room). The opening of the French social season begins on Tuesday, when more than 90,000 international collectors -- from the the Prince of Lichtenstein and the Princess of Kent to Baroness Philippine de Rothschild and Quentin Tarantino -- are expected to congregate for a two-week extravaganza of openings, parties and special events connected to the 20th edition of the Biennale International des Antiquaires, the Super Bowl of antiques fairs.</p>
        <p>''As antiques dealers, we are experiencing a fantastic era,'' said Claude Blaizot, president of the National Antiques Dealers Syndicate in France. ''We are witnessing Paris's comeback on the big chessboard, which the international art market represents.''</p>
        <p>The fair opens on Wednesday evening with a black-tie benefit for the Foundation for Paris Hospitals. Bernadette Chirac, wife of President Jacques Chirac of France, will welcome 800 guests to the dinner, which has been sold out since Aug. 1. Isabelle Adjani, Catherine Deneuve, Hubert Guerrand-Hermes and Dennis and Terry Stanfill are among the R.S.V.P.'s.</p>
        <p>Attending charity events is not considered particularly chic in Paris, but people clamor to attend this one because they are given the first crack at the Biennale. After dinner there is a private viewing, and, yes, shopping is allowed. The people viewing is pretty good, too.</p>
        <p>The festivities resume on Thursday night with a by-invitation-only opening cocktail party given under the patronage of President Chirac. Some 4,000 people attend, dressed to kill in their fall 2000 ''robes de cocktail.''</p>
        <p>The Biennale setting is far more elaborate than any of the American antiques fairs. The 116 dealers create stylish stands with wallpaper, damask or paneling on the walls, and marble or oak floors, whether they are selling Chinese pots or midcentury modern pieces. (The cost of the decor, of course, comes in addition to the booth rental fee, which is several hundred dollars a square meter.)</p>
        <p>''At least 10 percent of the dealers spend more than $250,000 on decoration,'' said Herve Aaron, a Paris dealer who is a longtime participant. ''We've been working on our booth since July in a warehouse near Roissy, where we did a mock-up of the space, which will be hexagonal with an 18th-century parquet de Versailles floor and Regence wood paneling on loan from a famous chateau.''</p>
        <p>He is trying to create a dazzling background for, among other things, a rare Louis XV white lacquered commode signed by Antoine-Mathieu Criard. ''He was one of the three most famous cabinetmakers for lacquer during the reign of Louis XV,'' Mr. Aaron said. ''And white is very unusual for lacquer in France.''</p>
        <p>Jacques Grange, a top Paris decorator, is designing the booth for Pierre Passebon, owner of Galerie de Passage. Francois-Joseph Graf has created settings for the pre-Colombian pots of Galerie Mermoz, the 18th-century furniture and objets d'art offered by the dealer Jacques Perrin, and the 20th-century specialist Robert Vallois.</p>
        <p>The dealers are making a huge effort this year, partly as a pre-emptive move to win clients' loyalties before Christie's and Sotheby's start conducting sales in Paris. After years of dallying, the French Parliament this year finally passed legislation to allow foreign auction houses to operate in France, and the two houses are expected to be in business by the winter.</p>
        <p>The art and antiques business is good in Paris. The French auction houses reported that turnover increased 19.5 percent in the first half of 2000.</p>
        <p>''The more competition there is, the more clients there will be,'' Mr. Blaizot said.</p>
        <p>The Biennale is held every other September in the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground space next to the Pyramid at the Louvre Museum. This year's collection opens to the public next Friday and runs through Oct. 1. To maintain its attraction to regular attendees -- who include Leon Black, Henry Kravis and Ronald Lauder -- the French dealers' organization has added 23 new dealers and organized a special Paris trip for American museum curators and their trustees.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco are among those sending curators. They will be given a private luncheon in the French Senate in the Luxembourg Palace, a superb Louis XIII building; a dinner at Malmaison, the house Napoleon built for Josephine; a tour of the 18th-century hotel particulier of Mr. and Mrs. Michel David-Weill; and cocktails with Felix Rohatyn, United States Ambassador to France, at the American Embassy, which is in a former Rothschild house.</p>
        <p>The Biennale is all about discoveries, and rediscoveries. This year Modernism buffs may want to see Galerie Olivier Watelet, with furniture by Jacques Quinet displayed in a booth with gold-leaf walls and bronze floor panels. Even experts in midcentury modern French furniture cannot often identify the work of this 20th-century Parisian interior architect and designer, though he is the subject of a new biography.</p>
        <p>Quinet (1918-1992) was the son of a taxi fleet owner in Caen, France, a city in Normandy that was leveled in World War II. Trained by the Jesuits, he seems to have been a precocious student.</p>
        <p>Before the war he went to Paris to work for an architect, Antoine Charpentier. At 21 he set up an office of his own. When World War II broke out, he was drafted into the French air force, then released when the government capitulated.</p>
        <p>In 1941 he reopened his office in Paris. He spent his days getting to know the skilled cabinetmakers and artisans in the Faubourg St. Antoine, near the place de la Bastille. Despite shortages of fine materials, be began to design bureaus in amaranth wood, tables with bronze legs and chairs in white oak covered in petit-point upholstery.</p>
        <p>His wife, Claude, admired as a hostess, invited clients and friends to soirees in their home. Soon Quinet was working for the directors of companies like Larousse, Evian, Air France, Dassault and Krema, a maker of sweets. He designed the interiors of planes, trains and ocean liners. He did several pieces of furniture for the residence of General Eisenhower at Marnes-la-Coquette.</p>
        <p>His furniture style was stripped down but elegantly neoclassical, with bronze ornament and supports. He also used lacquer regularly. He is ripe for discovery.</p>
        <p>The other great surprise in the Biennale is the booth of Mr. Vallois, who is showing a room full of museum-quality Eileen Gray furniture. It is a collection that he sold in 1971 and has reassembled for the fair.</p>
        <p>There are 15 pieces in the collection: furniture, rugs, lighting.</p>
        <p>Where is the surprise? ''Nothing is for sale.'' Mr. Vallois said.</p>
