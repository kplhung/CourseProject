        <p>Among the banquet of star museums offered by the culture-conscious state of Massachusetts, a feast that spreads from Boston and Cambridge to Worcester and Williamstown, a number of mini-institutions are often overlooked. They inhabit smaller towns and cities like Framingham, Fitchburg and Brockton; their annual budgets are under $2 million, and their collections -- where treasures can nevertheless be found -- are apt to lack depth.</p>
        <p>But they actively serve their communities by mounting shows, running art classes and acquiring works, not only by stellar names but also by deserving regional artists. To advance their interests some of the museums have formed the Consortium of New England Community Art Museums, which also includes small institutions in Connecticut, Rhode Island and Vermont.</p>
        <p>A layer below the large and midsize institutions, these museums offer an informal approach, an openness to new ideas and more than a few treasures to explore in the way of buildings, collections and exhibitions. Below are five examples, all within the orbit of Boston or Worcester, most established fairly recently in response to growing local support for the visual arts. They offer different experiences from larger institutions, in terms of size, ease of exploration, friendliness of staff, small surprises and delights.</p>
        <p>Art Complex Museum</p>
        <p>The most ingratiating of these minimuseums is the Art Complex Museum at Duxbury, built predominantly of wood with a deeply rippled roofline and set on 13 acres of woodland and open fields. Its larger locale is the manicured seaside town of Duxbury, one of whose earliest settlers was Myles Standish (1584-1656), military leader of the nearby Plymouth Colony and hero of Longfellow's highly fictitious ''Courtship of Myles Standish.''</p>
        <p>The museum has little or nothing to do, however, with early American history. It opened in 1971 as a center for regional arts and home for the copious collection of the Carl A. Weyerhaeuser family. The story goes that Carl, grandson of the founder of the Weyerhaeuser Lumber Company, was offered an expensive Packard by his father on graduating from Harvard but chose instead a Dodge and a Rembrandt print.</p>
        <p>His collecting activities branched out from American and European prints to Shaker furniture, American painting and Asian art. The museum, which has worthy holdings in all of these areas, was built at the urging of Carl's wife, Edith, who wished him to share his collections, and was designed by Ture Bengtz, its first director. Its current director, Charles A. Weyerhaeuser, is Carl and Edith's son.</p>
        <p>The complex, which is supported primarily by a family trust, includes a Japanese teahouse where tea ceremonies are conducted in the summer and a large studio for educational programs. An unusual library for a museum of this size has 4,000 books based on Carl's collections. Hanging in the entrance hall is a Tiffany glass window from Charles's grandmother's house in St. Paul.</p>
        <p>One of two shows currently in the museum's two ground-floor galleries is ''Millennium Masterpieces,'' which celebrates the widely diverse contents of the family collections. A lively miscellany, it includes wonderful examples of Shaker furniture; an extravagant tiara and necklace from 18th-century France; paintings by George Inness, George Bellows and John Singer Sargent; a bronze ewer from Korea, used in Buddhist ceremonies and dating to 1000 A.D.; and a 1910 Tiffany glass vase.</p>
        <p>The other show, ''The Old Ball Game,'' focuses on baseball's humanity and accessibility, using photographs, prints, sculpture and memorabilia, some of it borrowed from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. One of the exhibits is a baseball pinball game, made of found objects, that visitors may play. Its creator is an artist who serves as the museum's special projects coordinator, Craig Bloodgood, demonstrating the informal approach in which a small museum can luxuriate.</p>
        <p>Fitchburg Art Museum</p>
        <p>During a 40-year residence in Paris, Eleanor Norcross (1854-1923), a painter and daughter of Fitchburg's first mayor, was impressed with the small rural museums she found in northern France. In 1925 the bequest of her own collection and personal papers, along with some money to be matched by the people of Fitchburg -- an old mill city with a stable population of around 40,000 -- led to the founding of the Fitchburg Art Museum.</p>
        <p>Today the museum is a thriving complex of three buildings with more than 10,000 square feet of exhibition space. In 1989 it built a handsome addition, with slate floors and cherry-wood paneling, to allow it to present temporary and permanent installations at the same time.</p>
        <p>The wide-ranging collection runs from an Etruscan vase of the early sixth century to medieval manuscripts, decorative arts, three centuries of European and American paintings, watercolors, prints and drawings by artists from Rembrandt to Matisse. And of course the accomplished work of its founder. On Sept. 24 the museum will open ''Eleanor Norcross: Beyond Convention,'' a show devoted to her life.</p>
        <p>One of the permanent collection's gems is a sumptuous 1796 portrait by Joseph Wright of Derby (1734-1797) of a prosperous Liverpool businesswoman, Mrs. Sarah Clayton. Another is a dynamically stylized canvas by the American painter Joseph Stella (1877-1946) titled ''Full Moon, Barbados'' (1940).</p>
        <p>The museum has embarked on a series of highly focused shows zeroing in on a single object or phenomenon and its ramifications. The last one was devoted to nearby Mount Monadnock, said to be the most often climbed mountain in the world. With paintings by Rockwell Kent, Abbott Handerson Thayer and lesser-known worthies, it presented a view of the mountain as a muse and explored its connections -- including touristic -- with the community around it.</p>
        <p>In the last few years the museum has taken on a demanding new role, that of an art-based magnet school in conjunction with the Fitchburg public school system. Art-oriented pupils in Grades 5 through 8 report to the museum, where they learn by a process called object-based education that enlightens visually through use of the collection.</p>
        <p>Peter Timms, the museum's director, who with Roger Dell, the new education director, has been a driving force behind the program, said that the museum hoped to expand the concept to the ninth grade next year and ultimately would like to provide a full high school program.</p>
        <p>Fuller Museum of Art</p>
        <p>Location, location, location is a great feature of the Fuller Museum of Art in Brockton, which proclaims itself the largest visual arts institution and resource for arts education in southeastern Massachusetts. Its rambling building of slate and cedar shakes sits in a 22-acre woodland on the edge of a lily-padded pond, adjacent to a park designed by Frederic Law Olmsted's firm.</p>
        <p>The museum was founded in 1969 with $1 million bequeathed by Myron L. Fuller (1873-1960), a Brocktonian who became a successful hydrologist, geologist and entrepreneur. And if Brockton -- a city of some 100,000 that was once a shoe manufacturing center -- has seen better days, the tightly staffed museum, directed by Jennifer Atkinson, is going strong.</p>
        <p>Its 6,000 square feet of exhibition space runs from commodious, high-ceilinged galleries for changing exhibitions to patios for outdoor sculpture to smaller niches for community shows and displays of the permanent collection, comprising some 2,000 regional works of the late 19th and 20th centuries. As part of its program the Fuller conducts art classes and trains teenage docents, who get to organize their own shows.</p>
        <p>The major current exhibition is ''Face Off,'' organized by the Fuller's only curator, Denise Markonish. A show of offbeat figural work by 13 artists, including a few from New York, it tries to challenge viewers to rethink their responses to figural art.</p>
        <p>Among the highlights of this uneven exhibition are a massive wall of faces by Maciej Toporowicz, each of a serial killer and each done smudgily with the artist's own fingerprints; ''Sleep Study,'' a series of 140 small Polaroids by Joshua Deaner that reflect various moments and guises of his inner life; and Julian Opie's television set, tuned to a cartoony face that seems perfectly still. But at programmed intervals it blinks. And why not? There's a lot going on here.</p>
        <p>Cape Museum of Fine Arts</p>
        <p>Part of a sprawling compound in Dennis that includes the Cape Playhouse, the Cape Cinema and the Playhouse Restaurant, the idea of the Cape Museum of Fine Arts emerged around 1980 in a conversation between an art-collecting lawyer and a well-known potter. There were plenty of art associations on Cape Cod, but shouldn't there be a museum to conserve and exhibit the work of the many artists who frequented the area?</p>
        <p>Formed in 1981, the museum didn't open its present home until 1990. That happened after the donation and restoration of a group of buildings owned by a family in Harwichport. With great fanfare the buildings were trundled in 1987 from Harwichport to the compound in Dennis, and the museum had a permanent home.</p>
        <p>Its specialty is the collection and presentation of work by Cape artists, and its holdings of more than 1,000 objects illustrates the role that the Cape has taken in American art since 1899, when Charles Hawthorne, an Impressionist-influenced painter and teacher, opened his Cape Cod School of Art in Provincetown. Works by George Grosz (his ''Driftwood'' from about 1940 was a recent gift), Edwin Dickinson, Fritz Bultman, Robert Motherwell, Franz Kline, Michael Mazur and a number of students of the Abstract Expressionist painter Hans Hofmann, who frequented the Cape for years, are part of the collection and exhibit program.</p>
        <p>The museum presents changing exhibitions, like the current ''Surrealism in America During the 1930's and 1940's: Selections From the Penny and Elton Yasuna Collection.'' It displays more than 60 paintings, drawings and sculptures acquired over a 10-year period by a Harwich couple.</p>
        <p>An impressive assemblage, the show -- organized by the Salvador Dali Museum of St. Petersburg, Fla. -- examines the considerable role of Surrealism in American art and includes a number of artists with connections to the Cape, among them Motherwell, Theodoros Stamos, William Baziotes, Peter Busa, Boris Margo and Hofmann.</p>
        <p>Standouts include Alexander Calder's ''Length of Cable'' (1932), a Miro-esque drawing in which black asteroids cluster around a mysterious floating object in the shape of a double leg; Joseph Cornell's ''Celestial Navigation'' (circa 1950), a box fitted out with astrological symbolism; and Arshile Gorky's ''Figure 20 (Untitled)'' (circa 1932), a Picasso-influenced line drawing of a seated woman viewed both frontally and in profile.</p>
        <p>Under the direction of Gregory F. Harper, a $1.5 million capital campaign drive has so far brought about the renovation of a major gallery, a bright white space whose handsome wooden truss roof resembles the hull of a boat, and the unveiling of two new ones, one for sculpture. With another $100,000 to go, the museum expects to attain its goal of 10,000 square feet of gallery space, a library, an auditorium and an expanded office area, along with the beginnings of an endowment fund.</p>
        <p>Danforth Museum of Art</p>
        <p>Housed in an ancient but capacious former high school built in 1907, the Danforth Museum of Art was founded in 1973 under the leadership of a local couple, Paul and Elaine Marks. Although close to the rich spread of museums in Boston, Cambridge and Worcester, Framingham, a working-class town of 65,000, welcomed the idea of its own accessible institution.</p>
        <p>The idea became reality with the aid of political leaders, government officials and the administrators of Framingham State College, who agreed to subsidize the director's salary in return for a working relationship between the museum and the college. The name Danforth was chosen to symbolize the broad range of people who lived in Framingham and its surrounding communities, once a huge plantation owned by Thomas Danforth.</p>
        <p>When it opened its doors in 1975, the museum owned three donated works of art: prints by Goya, Durer and Daumier. It has since narrowed its collecting mission to American art of the 19th through the 21st centuries, and without acquisition funds has managed to assemble a collection of some 2,000 objects, largely through donations.</p>
        <p>Recently it raised the money to buy a pair of Gilbert Stuart portraits. Other stars in its group of earlier American paintings include Albert Bierstadt, Erastus Salisbury Field and Eastman Johnson. More contemporary artists, mostly represented by prints and drawings, include Red Grooms, Jim Dine, Philip Pearlstein, Dennis Oppenheim, Sam Messer and the Bostonians Michael Mazur, Sidney Hurwitz and Elsa Dorfman.</p>
        <p>Under its director, Ronald Crusan, the museum leads an active life, mounting 8 to 12 shows a year, not all, to be sure, as large as the recent display of Surrealist-oriented contemporary works from the holdings of Arthur S. Goldberg, a Boston collector. The Danforth's pride and joy is a large art school, which opened a year before the museum, and now has workshops in everything from painting to photography to jewelry making to matting and framing, along with classes for teenagers and toddlers with parents.</p>
        <p>The museum is pondering its future: whether to fix up the aging but still serviceable high school or to find itself another home. It may not be the prettiest face in the consortium, but for its constituency it is working fine, attracting some 25,000 visitors a year.</p>
