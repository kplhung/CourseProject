        <p>For Jeron Joseph, it was hard saying goodbye to the summer, no matter how fickle the weather.</p>
        <p>A high school junior, he was also worried about having to pass more and more Regents exams in order to graduate. But on opening day yesterday, he could not wait to see the inside of the Middle College High School in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, the first new high school be built in the borough in 17 years. After all, he had spent the last two years in a cramped, converted warehouse several blocks away.</p>
        <p>Just the night before, he had seen the principal, Charles L. Majors, talking about the $48.9 million school building on the evening news.</p>
        <p>''I called my friends and said, 'Yo, my school is on TV,' '' he said yesterday, taking a break from greeting his biology teacher. ''I was so excited I couldn't sleep.''</p>
        <p>Middle College, which has 800 students, is affiliated with Medgar Evers College, which will provide advanced courses for Middle College students and access to all its resources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Majors sees the new building -- a five-story slate-gray brick structure on Carroll Street -- and the association with the college as a boon for students as they begin to meet tougher standards for graduation. The new school is wired for high-speed Internet access, and every classroom is equipped with computers. Teachers have their own.</p>
        <p>Though major construction was completed in August, kinks were still being worked out yesterday. Some outlets were not working. Computers were not connected. And some landscaping was still being done.</p>
        <p>But after spending the summer worrying about tables, chairs, computers and the building's exterior, Mr. Majors seemed more concerned yesterday about how the students and teachers were faring.</p>
        <p>He had almost enough teachers -- 97 percent of them certified -- to fill his classrooms because he had hired many of the new ones by March, he said. As of noon yesterday, there was only one opening still to be filled: a Spanish teacher.</p>
        <p>''You cannot wait until the last minute to move on these things,'' he said, but he acknowledged that there was very little turnover at the school.</p>
        <p>Veronica Assent, an English teacher, said she was pleased to be working with so many familiar faces when so many other schools were going through considerable upheaval because of a court order requiring that new certified teachers be assigned to the 94 poorest-performing schools.</p>
        <p>Middle College was lucky. Some teachers were being shuffled from schools yesterday even though they had been hired before the order.</p>
        <p>Most students paid scant attention to questions of teacher hiring. But they did grapple with educational issues that affected them directly, like the new graduation standards.</p>
        <p>''I have to pass the math Regents in January,'' said Ginell Walker, 15, a 10th grader. ''I'm nervous, but I know I can do well because I've already passed the biology exam. I'm going to study my notes and I'm going to buy the Barron's study guide to pass in January.''</p>
        <p>For the last six years, Middle College was housed at 402 Eastern Parkway, a converted warehouse. The Board of Education created a new school, W. E. B. Du Bois, to take over the space freed up by Middle College. The old building will house a regular high school, a program for holdovers from the eighth grade and a night school program, said Joyce Coppin, Brooklyn's superintendent of high schools.</p>
        <p>Ron Fields, a senior from Crown Heights, could not believe his eyes when he saw the new Middle College building. He was there yesterday morning only to receive a report card to determine if he had passed his summer school courses.</p>
        <p>''I went to school in the old building for four years and it was crowded,'' he said. ''This is nice.''</p>
