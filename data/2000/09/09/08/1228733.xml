        <p>GIVE credit to Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director. He remains a genius hustler.

        <p>Mr. Krens's latest multinational enterprise links the Guggenheim and the cash-challenged Hermitage in St. Petersburg. This is a big deal potentially. The two museums plan jointly to franchise themselves (the Hermitage, like the Guggenheim, has already been multiplying, with an outpost in London and one coming in Amsterdam), and to swap pictures and exhibitions. A permanent, tourist-ensuring Hermitage section would be installed at the proposed Guggenheim near the Financial District. (Are you listening, City Hall?) There would even be more non modern art shows uptown.</p>

        <p>GIVE credit to Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director. He remains a genius hustler. For the opening yesterday of ''Amazons of the Avant-Garde,'' the exhibition of paintings by six Russian women from around the time of the Revolution, Mr. Krens invited President Vladimir Putin of Russia to stop by.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krens's latest multinational enterprise links the Guggenheim and the cash-challenged Hermitage in St. Petersburg. This is a big deal potentially. The two museums plan jointly to franchise themselves (the Hermitage, like the Guggenheim, has already been multiplying, with an outpost in London and one coming in Amsterdam), and to swap pictures and exhibitions. A permanent, tourist-ensuring Hermitage section would be installed at the proposed Guggenheim near the Financial District. (Are you listening, City Hall?) There would even be more non modern art shows uptown.</p>
        <p>You can bet that all such historical forays, should they materialize, will further infuriate the Metropolitan and other colleagues on whose territory Mr. Krens blithely poaches. He doesn't care, obviously. It's a new world he is designing for museums. Survival of the fittest. Perfect for Wall Street.</p>
        <p>And why complain? Cultural economics works in funny ways these days, but the system incidentally benefits the public, sometimes.</p>
        <p>Witness ''Amazons,'' a concise exercise, organized by Matthew Drutt, a Guggenheim curator, with Zelfira Tregulova and John Bowlt. Monographically arranged, it tendentiously focuses just on the years before and after the Revolution and on painting; several of the artists continued to work much later and did more than paint. The women (Aleksandra Exter, Natalia Goncharova, Liubov Popova, Olga Rozanova, Varvara Stepanova and Nadezhda Udaltsova) are familiar, thanks to a slew of Russian shows. Only a couple of them, Goncharova and Popova, are great painters; the others are not, but the exhibition isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. In one way or another, each nudged Russian culture, briefly anyway, into the 20th century, a testament to the impact of women on modern art before the word feminism came around.</p>
        <p>Except for Stepanova, they weren't especially political, at least not before the Revolution, meaning that they wanted artistic change, which was not the same as being Bolsheviks who wanted to knock off the czar. Mostly they were well-off. (Stepanova was the exception again.) They traveled around Europe, absorbed new French and Italian art and moved in connected circles, but often competitively.</p>
        <p>They didn't paint alike, so they certainly weren't a unified group. Goncharova mixed Russian folk art, Chinese and Byzantine art with German, French and Italian modernism to make neo-primitive, Cubo-Futurist, mystical masterpieces. As that list implies, her section of the show is a mad dash through different styles.</p>
        <p>Stepanova gravitated from Cubo-Futurist illustrated poems to images of dancing robots based on some sort of mathematical calculations she made. Udaltsova was a Cubist turned Suprematist. Exter was a colorist -- like her friends in Paris the artists Robert and Sonia Delaunay -- who was influenced not only by Cubism but also by Ukrainian embroidery. Popova, next to Goncharova, was the finest painter. She began with Cubism, then absorbed one idea after another before she, like several of these other women, decided in the revolutionary spirit that easel painting had had its day, and switched to utilitarian, proletariat-friendly textile and stage-set designing.</p>
        <p>The show doesn't pursue the story that far. Popova and Rozanova both died young. Goncharova left Moscow for Paris to design for Diaghilev and stayed. Exter moved to Paris in 1924 and taught at Leger's studio. Stepanova's career fizzled under the Soviet regime, as did the career of Udaltsova, branded a formalist by Stalin. She died in 1961.</p>
        <p>Linda Nochlin, the art historian, recently joked that before it all came apart, this was at least ''one avant-garde that featured women working rather than just taking off their clothes and lying down.'' True enough. They operated alongside their male counterparts without anybody seeming to consider it remarkable. If any of the women felt strongly about their role vis-a-vis the men, they kept their opinions to themselves. That wasn't their concern. Russia having had a tradition of female patrons, gallery owners and artists, they tapped into it naturally. On this issue the rest of Russian society was stuck in the middle ages, but the avant-garde provided a cocoon of comparative enlightenment and equal opportunity. The story in the exhibition seems if anything more, not less, remarkable, for having as little to do with gender as it does, and almost everything to do with painting.</p>
        <p>And that is what unites these women, despite the differences: they were all modern painters at a moment of incredible upheaval.</p>
        <p>If it were possible to have met any one of them, it would probably be Goncharova, the Damien Hirst of prerevolutionary Moscow, who issued crazy decrees, appeared in outrageous films and cabarets and scandalized the public with pictures that the police repeatedly confiscated as pornographic and blasphemous. She became a sensation and great success, her inspiration having been the Futurists. She aspired not just to Futurism's aesthetic but also to its mastery of hype, its worship of change for its own sake. At the same time her art came from a mind saturated in fantasies of homeland, mystical religion, primitive art, peasant society and the peculiarities of the human body.</p>
        <p>''Peasants Gathering Grapes'' typifies at least two of her fixations, ancient stone idols and native Russian subjects, which she combines into a purely modern image whose god (Futurism's god, too) was the machine.</p>
        <p>The other women achieved Goncharova's imaginative level sporadically. Rozanova ended up painting a couple of amazing abstractions, one of them a single quivering green stripe against bare white, Barnett Newman before the fact.</p>
        <p>Udaltsova, who studied in Paris under Jean Metzinger and Henri Le Fauconnier, made solid, unremarkable Cubist pictures with exceptions like ''At the Piano'': its fragmented forms, in syncopated rhythm, imply movement ingeniously. Stepanova's illustrated poems and dancing figures are crudely painted, which becomes a virtue in one striking self-portrait in which she grimaces, a tick-tack-toe board and black dots for her eyes, eyebrows and nose.</p>
        <p>Popova's legacy is obscured without the textiles, typography and stage designs, although the paintings, even this show's uneven selection of them, give an idea of her gifts. As with Udaltsova, she studied in Paris under Metzinger and Le Fauconnier, and she must have scrutinized Leger from the beginning, because ''Composition With Figures,'' its mechanical figures locked in a shimmer of gold-blue faceting, is very close to his style. But it is far from secondhand because of Popova's extraordinary way of building space and her exquisite touch.</p>
        <p>She was said to have been inspired by Italian Renaissance art, too, and this composition, the figures in a landscape, is so basic that it goes back at least to Giorgione, typifying, perhaps, the ambition of the Russian avant-gardists to evoke the old Renaissance to bring about a new one.</p>
        <p>''The world has been transformed into a single, monstrous, fantastic, perpetually moving machine,'' wrote the poet Aleksander Shevchenko in 1913. ''We, like some kind of ideally manufactured mechanical man, have grown used to living, getting up, going to bed, eating and working by the clock -- and the sense of rhythm and mechanical harmony, reflected in the whole of our life, cannot help but be reflected in our thinking and in our spiritual life: in Art.''</p>
        <p>It sounded good at the time, the promise of mechanization and modernity. In the paintings of these women it clearly flourished, unspoiled, before Stalin flipped Shevchenko's vision on its head, making mechanized society a dystopia.</p>
        <p>The works in ''Amazons'' have a surprising fortitude even now. Revolution. A brave new art world. The idea persists although the form it takes continually changes. Ask Mr. Krens.</p>
        <p>''Amazons of the Avant-Garde'' is at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Jan. 7.</p>
