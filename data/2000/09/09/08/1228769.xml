        <p>In a race to become the America Online of Europe, Italy's second-largest Internet service provider, Tiscali S.p.A., said today that it had agreed to acquire the troubled Dutch Internet company World Online N.V. for $5.1 billion in stock. The move makes the combined company the second-largest Internet service provider in Europe behind T-Online, a unit of Deutsche Telekom of Germany.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the United States, where the Internet access business has been mainly dominated by one company, America Online, the Internet service provider business in Europe is much more fractured. And for most Internet service providers in Europe, making money from providing Internet access has so far proved to be a difficult task.</p>

        <p>In a race to become the America Online of Europe, Italy's second-largest Internet service provider, Tiscali S.p.A., said today that it had agreed to acquire the troubled Dutch Internet company World Online N.V. for $5.1 billion in stock. The move makes the combined company the second-largest Internet service provider in Europe behind T-Online, a unit of Deutsche Telekom of Germany.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the United States, where the Internet access business has been mainly dominated by one company, America Online, the Internet service provider business in Europe is much more fractured. And for most Internet service providers in Europe, making money from providing Internet access has so far proved to be a difficult task.</p>
        <p>Today's announcement that Tiscali would acquire World Online brings to an end negotiations between the two companies that have lasted for more than two months. World Online had been seeking a partner since the beginning of the summer as its stock price has continued to suffer, hovering around 15 euros, or about one-third of the price of the company's initial public offering in March.</p>
        <p>While the combined company will have 3.5 million subscribers, it remains substantially smaller than T-Online, which has more than six million Internet users. Nonetheless, the deal will give the enlarged Tiscali 1.6 billion euros in cash and a market value of about 12.5 billion, allowing it to make further acquisitions.</p>
        <p>For World Online, the deal begins a new chapter in the life of the Dutch online business that was seemingly scarred back in March when regulators said they would investigate the company's disputed initial public offering. A group of shareholders plan to sue the company. They say that World Online's chairwoman at the time, Nina Brink, acted improperly by not fully disclosing that she sold her stock before the offering. The value of the company fell to 3.8 billion euros, down from 12 billion euros when shares of World Online were first offered to the public.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brink resigned from World Online on April 14, about a month after the company went public.</p>
        <p>Renato Soru, Tiscali's founder, will be chairman of the combined company. James Kinsella, a former chief executive of MSNBC.com, who took over World Online when Ms. Brink resigned, will be chief executive.</p>
        <p>Tiscali was advised by UBS Warburg, N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons Ltd., Rothschild Italia S.p.A. and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. Goldman Sachs International, which helped manage World Online's initial public offering, and Merrill Lynch International advised World Online.</p>
