        <p>The Senate took an important step closer today to a final vote on President Clinton's major trade bill with China, as momentum built for final passage next week after months of delay.</p>
        <p>In a victory for the White House and the business community, senators voted, 92 to 5, to end preliminary debate and proceed to final consideration of a measure that would establish permanent trade relations with China and end Congress's annual review of Beijing's trade status.</p>
        <p>The Senate then rejected the first of several amendments that threatened to undercut the bill. An amendment by Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, calling on China to increase religious freedom was defeated, 69 to 28.</p>
        <p>''The Clinton administration is focused on trade, which it is now promoting as its human rights policy,'' Mr. Wellstone said. ''But trade alone will never guarantee change.''</p>
        <p>A Republican, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and one of most conservative senators, joined Mr. Wellstone, one of the chamber's leading liberals, in support of the amendment.</p>
        <p>''We in America still stand for something -- something other than profit,'' Mr. Helms said. ''We don't believe China should be welcomed into international organizations such as the World Trade Organization while China continues to repress and to jail and to murder and to torture their own citizens.''</p>
        <p>Another amendment, this one by Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, to support the export of nonpolluting energy technology to China, lost by 65 to 31.</p>
        <p>A third measure, by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, to continue Congress's annual review of China's trade status, was defeated, 81 to 13.</p>
        <p>The House approved the contentious trade bill in May, 237 to 197, and more than 70 senators are likely to support the measure in the final vote.</p>
        <p>The only mystery left is whether senators will vote to link passage of the trade measure to concerns over China's record on human rights, religious freedom and the environment.</p>
        <p>In any other context, many of the amendments would have broad support. But if the Senate adopts any amendments, the bill would have to be returned to the House, where supporters say there is not enough time to reconcile differences before the November elections.</p>
        <p>Passage of the legislation is a necessary step for American companies to benefit fully from a deal reached last year by the United States and China that paves China's way into the World Trade Organization, the 135-member trade group that sets the rules for global commerce.</p>
        <p>Regardless of how lawmakers vote, China will enter the W.T.O. But without the blessing bestowed by Congress, Beijing could withhold some trade benefits from the United States that it extends to other members of the group.</p>
        <p>The biggest obstacle to passing a clean bill is a possible amendment by Senators Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, and Robert G. Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>It would require the administration to monitor China's record on the spread of nuclear, chemical, biological and missile technology, and would impose sanctions if there was  evidence of certain types of prohibited weaponry.</p>
        <p>President Clinton's top aides oppose the measure, arguing that the legislation would hamper the administration's efforts to combat proliferation.</p>
        <p>Support for it as an amendment to the trade bill appeared to be eroding today. Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, who backs the idea, met with supporters and opponents today to try to arrange a separate vote on it.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for Mr. Torricelli and another sponsor of the original legislation, Senator Michael D. Crapo, Republican of Idaho, said the senators had strong reservations about supporting it as an amendment to the trade bill.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the Thompson measure expressed optimism they had enough support to defeat it..</p>
        <p>''I'm hopeful that we've got the votes, and I'm reasonably optimistic that we do,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. ''But in any election or any vote, only the paranoid survive, and I think we've got to be sufficiently paranoid.''</p>
        <p>The Senate will debate other potentially crippling amendments through next week.</p>
