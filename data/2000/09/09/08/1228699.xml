        <p>Evidently Plate 347 has arrived with barely a moment to spare. In an area that is neither one neighborhood nor another, the menu at this shining copper bar and bistro has drawn local diners like an offer of free money. To seek the reason, one need only look around. Until now the area has been defined by the police station and the ceaseless traffic headed downtown.</p>
        <p>The elements at Plate 347 could not be simpler. The restaurant occupies a slim storefront, and it offers a slightly jazzed-up bistro menu with appetizers like a salad of frisee and lardons, served with little pastry triangles filled with Roquefort and walnuts, and sauteed squid with piquillo peppers, garlic and lemon juice.</p>

        <p>Evidently Plate 347 has arrived with barely a moment to spare. In an area that is neither one neighborhood nor another, the menu at this shining copper bar and bistro has drawn local diners like an offer of free money. To seek the reason, one need only look around. Until now the area has been defined by the police station and the ceaseless traffic headed downtown.</p>
        <p>The elements at Plate 347 could not be simpler. The restaurant occupies a slim storefront, and it offers a slightly jazzed-up bistro menu with appetizers like a salad of frisee and lardons, served with little pastry triangles filled with Roquefort and walnuts, and sauteed squid with piquillo peppers, garlic and lemon juice.</p>
        <p>There is steak frites, of course, but the steak has a horseradish marrow crust. Braised lamb shank gets a mildly Moroccan treatment, with cumin-spiced couscous. Snapper, cooked in parchment, is bathed in a saffron broth and served with potatoes, fennel and roasted garlic. Salmon, brushed with a port-wine glaze, is surrounded by phyllo pastry and served with braised lentils.</p>
        <p>The dessert menu is short, led by the inevitable creme brulee and apple tart. The search for variety begins and ends with a dense, intensely flavored chocolate souffle cake in raspberry sauce. The wine list, too, is small. But the crowd is big.</p>
        <p>Plate 347, 347 Second Avenue, at 20th Street, Manhattan; (212) 388-0526. Dinner entrees, $9.50 to $22.</p>
