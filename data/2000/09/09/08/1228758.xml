        <p>CMGI, one of the earliest and savviest investors in the Internet, announced a sweeping restructuring yesterday meant to reassure disenchanted investors that it was moving toward becoming profitable and was picking the winners among the plethora of companies it owns.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Andover, Mass., has backed companies including GeoCities, Lycos and Alta Vista. At the beginning of the year, it had a market value of nearly $50 billion. But since then its shares have plunged by 69 percent, more than many big Internet companies. Its shares closed yesterday at $43.19, up $3.50.</p>

        <p>CMGI, one of the earliest and savviest investors in the Internet, announced a sweeping restructuring yesterday meant to reassure disenchanted investors that it was moving toward becoming profitable and was picking the winners among the plethora of companies it owns.</p>
        <p>The company, based in Andover, Mass., has backed companies including GeoCities, Lycos and Alta Vista. At the beginning of the year, it had a market value of nearly $50 billion. But since then its shares have plunged by 69 percent, more than many big Internet companies. Its shares closed yesterday at $43.19, up $3.50.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the company said it would reduce its 17 majority-owned businesses to 5 to 10, organized around five business lines. It will merge three venture capital funds into a single fund. It will also abandon plans for a fund meant to invest in Internet companies overseas with Hicks, Muse Tate &amp; Furst, the buyout firm, and Pacific Century CyberWorks, an Internet company, because of differences among the partners over the structure of the fund.</p>
        <p>''Improving our path to profitability is the single driving force here,'' David Wetherell, CMGI's chairman, said in a conference call.</p>
        <p>CMGI identified five broad business categories in which it would concentrate: search and portals; infrastructure and enabling technologies; professional services; interactive marketing; and electronic business. It hopes to wind up the revamping with one or two companies in each of these areas that it will ultimately take public. A few of its companies, like Engage, a database advertising company, already have public shareholders.</p>
        <p>As for the weaker companies in each area, it will decide whether to merge them into the stronger ones, sell them, or close them. It also hopes to acquire new companies, especially profitable ones, to shore up its businesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wetherell refused to name the businesses he considered weak or to say how many people would be laid off, but he said the company had routinely pared positions even as it had grown rapidly. CMGI acquired 33 companies in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Notably, CMGI did not create a business line for Internet content or community, two areas in which it had many early investments. Indeed some companies like Icast, an music and entertainment service, fit awkwardly into the new structure.</p>
        <p>The company said it hoped that the new organization would reassure investors who, looking past the dazzle of CMGI's investment success, found the company a jumble of largely unrelated businesses. Starting with CMGI's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to be released on Sept. 21, the company will report revenue and operating earnings separately for each of these segments.</p>
        <p>Paul L. Merenbloom, an analyst for Prudential Securities, said CMGI's move reflected strength rather than the desperation seen at so many Internet companies these days. With CMGI burning through $50 million in cash each month and investing another $25 million through its venture arm, the company's $1.7 billion in cash will last nearly two years.</p>
        <p>''That's an eternity on the Internet,'' Mr. Merenbloom said.</p>
