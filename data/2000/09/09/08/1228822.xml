        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>AUSTRIA: E.U. REPORT DUE  A report commissioned by the European Union to help it decide whether to continue sanctions against Austria is to be presented today to the current holder of the rotating E.U. presidency, President Jacques Chirac of France. The sanctions were imposed in February after the far-right Freedom Party joined Austria's ruling coalition. The report was to evaluate the ''respect'' of the Austrian government for ''common European values'' as well as the evolution of the Freedom Party.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: GREEK MEETS MILOSEVIC  Foreign Minister George Papandreou of Greece met in Belgrade with President Slobodan Milosevic, the first NATO foreign minister to do so since the alliance bombed Yugoslavia last year. There was speculation about what larger message from the West Mr. Papandreou, left, might be passing on to Mr. Milosevic, given the lavish pre-election coverage his meeting with Mr. Milosevic, indicted for war crimes, received on state television. Mr. Papandreou also met opposition leaders.</p>

        <p>GREECE: TERRORISM ACCORD  Public Order Minister Michalis Chryssochoides will sign an accord in Washington today providing for cooperation with the F.B.I. in the fight against terrorism, organized crime, Internet espionage and drug smuggling. The government had resisted signing the accord for two years, but changed its position after a British military attache was assassinated in Athens in June and Greece was awarded the 2004 Olympic Games.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: GAY AMERICANS SEE SITES  The police provided extra security in Istanbul for about 800 gay Americans who toured historic sites without incident after being refused access to other locations in Turkey. The group told the State Department they were discriminated against after the police in the Aegean port of Kusadasi refused to allow them to tour Ephesus and other sites.</p>

        <p>ALBANIA: DESTROYING ARMS  With the help of the United States, Germany and Norway, Albania will destroy 100,000 small arms collected from civilians who stole them from army depots in 1997, officials said. More than 600,000 weapons were looted in the 1997 anarchy caused when fraudulent pyramid schemes collapsed, wiping out the savings of thousands of Albanians.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: PRESIDENTIAL BREAK-IN  A homeless man broke into President Thabo Mbeki's Cape Town residence and lived there for days before being arrested on Tuesday, The Star reported. A presidential spokeswoman said the 27-year-old intruder had not gained entry to the private quarters of Mr. Mbeki, who was away when the man broke in last Friday.</p>

        <p>CANADA: DEFECTION TO RIGHT  In the latest sign that Canada's new right-wing party is emerging from its western base, the Canadian Alliance won the loyalty of Jim Jones, the lone Tory member of Parliament from Ontario. The defection came two days after Brian Mulroney, a former Tory prime minister, described the dwindled state of his party as ''difficult and challenging'' and called Stockwell Day, leader of the Alliance, a ''fine gentleman.'' Mr. Mulroney does not support the Alliance.</p>

        <p>ARGENTINA: IMMUNITY VOTE  The lower house of Congress, under pressure from a bribes-for-votes scandal, voted to end a sweeping immunity protecting lawmakers, judges and government ministers from prosecution. It will now go to the Senate, where it is expected to be approved.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: AIDE COMMITS SUICIDE  An undersecretary in the Commerce Department killed himself in a growing controversy over the management of a national car registry, senior officials said. The registry was run by a former Argentine military officer, hired by the Commerce Department, who stands accused by a Spanish judge of murder and torture under Argentina's military junta two decades ago. Officials said the undersecretary, Raul Ramos Tercero, left behind six suicide notes denying culpability.</p>

        <p>CUBA: NEWS BUREAUS ALLOWED  The Chicago Tribune and The Dallas Morning News learned that they will be allowed to open offices in Havana, joining The Associated Press and CNN as the only United States news organizations with bureaus in the country.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: GUARDS IN BEATINGS DETAINED  A Jerusalem court ordered the detention of three Israeli border police officers after they beat three Palestinian laborers on Wednesday and photographed one another stepping on their victims. The swift legal action against the officers, who confessed under questioning, was taken after Israel Radio broadcast graphic accounts of the beatings by one of the laborers and their Israeli supervisor. Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami, above, called the officers' behavior beastly.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: GENERAL STEPS DOWN  Israel's military commander in the West Bank will leave his post as a result of a bungled raid in the West Bank in which three Israeli soldiers were killed by their own men, Israel's army chief said. Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz said he had accepted the resignation of Brig. Gen. Shlomo Oren.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: NEW TALIBAN GAINS  The ruling Taliban militia claimed more gains against opposition forces in the northern province of Takhar as thousands of people fled the region to escape the fighting. Taliban fighter jets pounded opposition positions, said the opposition spokesman, Muhammad Abil. It was not possible to confirm the number of dead, reported by the Russian news agency Interfax to total 800.</p>
