        <p>MANHATTAN: MUSEUM TALKS TO BEGIN -- The Museum of Modern Art and the union representing 250 of its professional and administrative workers are scheduled to hold negotiations today for the first time since the union went on strike in late April. Officials with the union, Local 2110 of the United Automobile Workers, predicted progress in the talks, saying the museum was on the defensive because the city's labor movement persuaded City Council members from Manhattan not to recommend a variance for the museum's $650 million expansion project. But museum officials say they have a strong hand, noting that construction unions working on preliminary demolition for the expansion are crossing the museum workers' picket line.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: PAPER BALLOTS FOR GREEN PARTY -- A federal district judge in Manhattan refused yesterday to order the New York City Board of Elections to place the names of Green Party candidates for United States Senate on voting machines rather than on separate paper ballots in Tuesday's primary. The party had sued, charging discrimination, and told Judge Gerard E. Lynch it would lose valuable campaign time in the general election waiting for paper ballots to be counted. The candidates are Al Lewis, who played Grandpa on ''The Munsters''; Mark Dunau, a farmer from Hancock, N.Y.; and Ronnie Dugger, a former newspaper publisher. A city lawyer told the judge the board would try to count the paper ballots within 48 hours.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: PATAKI FAULTS LACK OF VIRUS AID -- Gov. George E. Pataki lashed out at the Clinton administration yesterday, saying that it had failed to provide the state with desperately needed money to help combat the spread of the West Nile virus. The state had requested $20 million in emergency federal financing to contain the virus, but yesterday was told it would not receive the money, according to Mr. Pataki. ''It is outrageous that the Clinton administration has turned a deaf ear to the public health of millions of New Yorkers,'' Mr. Pataki said. He said the virus had turned up in 51 of the state's 62 counties, including all of New York City, yet federal financing accounted for only 2 percent of spending to combat the virus in the state.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: DAY CARE OVERSIGHT TIGHTENED -- Gov. George E. Pataki has signed legislation that calls for extensive criminal background checks of day care center workers and operators. The law bars people convicted of a violent crime, a sex crime or a recent drug offense from working in a child care center. The new law also requires 30 hours of training for day care workers, twice the 15 now required. At the same time, the state is providing $808 million in financing for child care programs.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: SERIAL RAPIST SENTENCED AGAIN -- A serial rapist already convicted in the Bronx and sentenced to 145 years in prison received an additional 195 years of prison time yesterday, when he was sentenced in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges of rape, attempted rape and burglary. The man, Isaac Jones, was described by the judge yesterday as a ''heartless predator'' who victimized his community and should ''deservedly breathe his last breath in prison.'' Last year, the police were searching for Mr. Jones when four officers mistook Amadou Diallo for him and shot at Mr. Diallo 41 times.  Katherine E. Finkelstein (NYT)</p>
        <p>QUEENS: STING AT BROTHELS -- Six people were arrested in a sting operation on charges that they ran two brothels in Queens that earned $2 million a year, and that they tried to bribe undercover investigators posing as corrupt  police officers seeking protection money, the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, left, announced yesterday. He said investigators collected $102,000 in payoffs over nine months from operators of the brothels, at 104-12 Roosevelt Avenue and 102-05 44th Avenue, after one of the suspects approached an officer in December and offered him cash for protection against the police.</p>

        <p>PATERSON: WOMAN FACES ADULT CHARGES -- A young woman held on juvenile charges that she murdered her infant by throwing him into the Passaic River in June can be tried as an adult, a state judge ruled yesterday. The case against the woman, Martida Gonzalez, who turned 18 in July, will be brought before a grand jury within two months, said Boris Moczula, the first assistant Passaic County prosecutor. Her lawyer, Anthony Fusco, said the ruling was no surprise because a change in state law in March made it easier to charge 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. He said that Ms. Gonzalez was suicidal, and that an insanity plea was likely.</p>

        <p>EDGEWATER: NO FLAMMABLE LIQUID FOUND -- Lab tests have not found any traces of flammable liquid in debris left by a raging fire that destroyed 240 unfinished apartments on Aug. 30 in a $70 million development under construction here. The rubble was analyzed at a research lab of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Rockville, Md.  Robert Hanley (NYT)</p>
        <p>BERKELEY: OFFICER KILLED IN CRASH -- An off-duty police officer died Wednesday after his motorcycle collided with a school bus carrying students home. The officer, Frank Podbielski, 33, who was the Tuckerton Police Department's traffic safety officer, was riding on Route 9 at 3:30 p.m., and struck the bus as it was turning onto Route 9 from Serpentine Road, said Officer Richard Bush of the Berkeley Police. None of the 14 middle school students were hurt, but 2 sought counseling yesterday, said Dr. Carol L. D'Zio, superintendent of the Central Regional School District. The crash is under investigation.</p>

        <p>NEW HAVEN: NEW VIEW OF BOY'S DEATH -- Toxicology tests completed last week found narcotics in the body of a 19-month-old West Haven boy who died in July, and the authorities now say he may have been murdered. Investigators found no outward signs of abuse, and initially believed the boy died of natural causes, said Judy Mongillo, a spokeswoman for the New Haven Police Department. And while the medical examiner's office has not ruled the death a homicide, it has changed the boy's death certificate to list the cause of death as acute opiate intoxication, Ms. Mongillo said.</p>
