        <p>With a four-year, $13 million contract that makes him the highest paid player on the Islanders, defenseman Roman Hamrlik will finally join the team, but it won't be in time for the start of training camp, which gets under way today at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''I am very relieved and extremely happy to have such a premier defenseman signed up long term,'' General Manager Mike Milbury said yesterday afternoon. ''He is a top player who adds to what we believe already is a very good group of defenseman. I can't wait to see him.''</p>

        <p>With a four-year, $13 million contract that makes him the highest paid player on the Islanders, defenseman Roman Hamrlik will finally join the team, but it won't be in time for the start of training camp, which gets under way today at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''I am very relieved and extremely happy to have such a premier defenseman signed up long term,'' General Manager Mike Milbury said yesterday afternoon. ''He is a top player who adds to what we believe already is a very good group of defenseman. I can't wait to see him.''</p>
        <p>Hamrlik, a two-time All-Star who was acquired in June in a trade with Edmonton, was making arrangements to travel to Lake Placid from the Czech Republic and should be on the ice Sunday.</p>
        <p>The deal means that only two players -- the restricted free agents Zdeno Chara and Brad Isbister -- are unsigned as the six-day minicamp begins.</p>
        <p>Chara, a defenseman, has been offered a four-year, $4 million contract, while Isbister, who was second on the team in scoring with 22 goals and 42 points last season, has turned down an offer of as much as four years that would pay him $700,000 in the first year, double his salary last season.</p>
        <p>Forward Mariusz Czerkawski said it was unfortunate that the team would not have Chara and Isbister in the minicamp.</p>
        <p>''That's the only minus,'' he said. ''You're excited, as always, to be going to training camp and with all the changes that have been made over the summer, it seems like we're a better team.''</p>
        <p>While there may not be a Stanley Cup looming, the Islanders, with their financially solvent new owners, Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar of Computer Associates, are approaching training camp with more than the usual sense of preseason optimism -- their 24 victories last season notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>''I think we feel more secure; we don't have to worry about playing somewhere else besides the Coliseum or other off-the-ice stuff,'' center Claude Lapointe said. ''We just have to worry about hockey.''</p>
        <p>Among the new players heading to Lake Placid were 18-year-old goaltender Rick DiPietro, who was the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, and forward Raffi Torres, another first-round pick.</p>
        <p>Defenseman Kenny Jonsson, the team captain, who signed a one-year contract last week, said he was feeling fine, despite suffering lingering effects from a concussion throughout the latter part of last season.</p>
        <p>''So far, so good,'' Jonsson said. ''Everything's been fine in all the tests. It's nice to be here from the start.''</p>
