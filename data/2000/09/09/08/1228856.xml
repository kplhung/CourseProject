        <p>Two men and three teenage boys were arrested outside the MTV Video Music Awards yesterday evening after rubbing up against young women on the jammed sidewalks near Radio City Music Hall, the police said.</p>
        <p>All were charged with third-degree sexual abuse, a misdemeanor, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman. Both the victims and the abusers were fully clothed, he said.</p>
        <p>The first incident occurred just before 6 p.m, when Mehran Sedaghatpour, 39, of Great Neck, N.Y. pressed his crotch against the buttocks of a 21-year-old and a 22-year-old woman on Avenue of the Americas across the street from Radio City, which is at 50th Street, Sergeant Nikas said. He was also charged with resisting arrest.</p>
        <p>At 6:25 p.m., three teenagers who an investigator said were related to one another were arrested for similar offenses on 51st Street east of Avenue of the Americas. A 14-year-old boy rubbed up against an 18-year-old, a 15-year-old rubbed against another 18-year-old, and a 16-year-old, Martin Caimpos of Yonkers, rubbed against another 18-year-old, Sergeant Nikas said. The two younger boys' names were not released because they are juveniles.</p>
        <p>Nearby at the same time, James Surace, 46, of Brooklyn, rubbed up against a 16-year-old girl, Sergeant Nikas said.</p>
        <p>Also last night, inside Radio City, the bass player for the rap-rock band Rage Against the Machine, Timothy Commerford, 32, was arrested after disrupting the ceremony by climbing on props, threatening to jump down, and assaulting a policeman who tried to subdue him, Sergeant Nikas said.</p>
