        <p>Art Dealer Pleads Guilty</p>

        <p>Art Dealer Pleads Guilty</p>
        <p>ALEC WILDENSTEIN, 60, the billionaire art dealer who was a fugitive for two years after being charged with menacing his estranged wife with a handgun, pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor yesterday in Manhattan Criminal Court.</p>
        <p>On a night in September 1997, the police were called to the couple's town house at 11 East 64th Street, where JOCELYNE WILDENSTEIN, then 52, told officers that her husband had waved a loaded 9-millimeter pistol at her during an argument.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wildenstein fled the country a year later rather than face trial on the charge.</p>
        <p>He appeared yesterday before Judge Suzanne Mondo to plead guilty to charges of menacing in the third degree. He agreed to abide by a yearlong order of protection that bars him from contacting his former wife. The judge also lifted his gun license. Basically he is on probation for a year and will not face jail or a fine if he avoids arrest during that time.</p>
        <p>Cheryl Joseph, the assistant district attorney, told the judge that the former Mrs. Wildenstein had been informed of the plea deal and was satisfied with it.</p>
        <p>The couple were divorced after the gun incident, with Mr. Wildenstein complaining that his wife's ''continuing plastic surgery and hair transplants and tattooing'' had subjected them to ''public ridicule.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wildenstein is the chief operating officer for a family art empire that includes the Wildenstein Gallery at 19 East 64th Street and the Pace Wildenstein Gallery at 32 East 57th Street, as well as art firms overseas.</p>
        <p>Hip-Hopping  For a Good Cause</p>
        <p>Hip-hop mingled with classic funk and soul at the Copacabana on Wednesday night at a benefit concert for the Wyclef Jean Foundation, which seeks to heighten public awareness and support of music education in minority schools.</p>
        <p>WYCLEF JEAN, the hip-hop singer and former member of the Fugees, performed three songs from his new album ''The Ecleftic'' accompanied by the group EARTH, WIND &amp; FIRE, his brother Sedeck and his sister Melky.</p>
        <p>''Wyclef is like my brother,'' said LIL' KIM, dressed in very little, all of it Gucci. ''Everything he does, I'll be there.'' Other guests included the magician DAVID BLAINE, the tap dancer SAVION GLOVER and the record company executive CLIVE DAVIS.</p>
        <p>KADIATOU DIALLO, the mother of Amadou Diallo, who was fatally shot by the police in the Bronx in 1999, also attended. The new album includes a song dedicated to Amadou Diallo.</p>
        <p>Before his performance, Mr. Jean unveiled the Brattle Award in honor of fur designer NAJI BRATTLE, who died this year at age 37 from a brain aneurysm. The award will be given to an outstanding child who is a recipient of foundation funds.</p>
        <p>Writers Write  About E-Mail</p>
        <p>In the continuing migration from the Internet into print, Yahoo Internet Life magazine marked its fourth anniversary this month by asking writers and others to write about writing e-mail. Contributors to the inaugural run of the series called ''The E-Mail Chronicles'' included GEORGE PLIMPTON, SUSAN CHEEVER, JONATHAN ROSEN, BEN STEIN and ESTHER DYSON, the futurist.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cheever lamented the early days of e-mail when she could do things like harass Time magazine's editor, Walter Isaacson, about problems with her subscription.</p>
        <p>''E-mail used to be really magic, and it's not anymore,'' she said on Wednesday night at Elaine's, where the magazine celebrated the new series.</p>
        <p>''When no one had e-mail, it was great. Now I keep changing my e-mail address.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Plimpton, who confessed to barely tolerating electronic tapping, lampooned a friend who gave up his phone and was then mildly envious when Mr. Plimpton's frequently dormant computer was nearly infected by the ''I Love You'' virus.</p>
        <p>''I browsed the Internet once,'' Mr. Plimpton admitted at the party. ''I was trying to find out the names of famous rightfielders in baseball.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 21, 2000, Thursday  A report in the Public Lives column on Sept. 8 about the Wyclef Jean Foundation's new prize for outstanding students misspelled the names of the award and of the fur designer for whom it is named. It is the Battle Award, not the Brattle Award. The designer, who died this year at 37, was Nija Battle, not Naji Brattle.</p>
