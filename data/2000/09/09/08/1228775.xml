        <p>The State of Louisiana agreed in Federal District Court in Baton Rouge yesterday to sweeping changes in the way it runs its juvenile prisons, including steps to protect inmates from abusive guards and promises to provide medical, dental and mental health care.</p>
        <p>The agreement was intended to settle several lawsuits against the state, including one by the United States Department of Justice, which charged that teenage inmates were being deprived of food, clothing and medical care and were routinely beaten by guards.</p>
        <p>While providing better treatment for inmates, the agreement would effectively end Louisiana's experiment with privately run juvenile prisons, where the worst abuses had occurred, said David Utter, director of the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, which provides legal services to incarcerated juveniles.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Louisiana was prohibited from placing any more young inmates in a prison at Jena, which had been run by the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, a subsidiary of Wackenhut Corporation, and the world's largest operator of for-profit prisons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Utter said the state had also agreed to prohibit a company operated by friends of former Gov. Edwin W. Edwards, which owned a juvenile prison at Tallulah, from managing the prison. The state took control of the Tallulah prison in 1999.</p>
        <p>Richard Stalder, the secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, said in a news conference yesterday with Gov. Mike Foster that the increase in youthful offenders had forced Louisiana to expand juvenile prisons but that its  ''efforts to provide some of these services through privately operated facilities were a disappointment.''</p>
        <p>''All of Louisiana's secure juvenile facilities now are operated directly by our department,'' Mr. Stalder said. ''The state is confident that difficulties experienced in the past will not recur. We are pleased to be able to put this litigation behind us.''</p>
        <p>Louisiana had tried to privatize its juvenile prisons to cut costs, but the effort raised questions about whether for-profit corporations could operate prisons more efficiently than state governments without skimping on essential services and training.</p>
        <p>As often in Louisiana, the plan was enmeshed in a political scandal. Another friend and business partner of  Mr. Edwards, Cecil Brown, is awaiting trial in federal court in Baton Rouge, with the former mayor of Houston, Fred Hofheinz, on charges of conspiracy, extortion and bribery in trying to obtain the contract to operate the juvenile prison at Jena.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown has been accused of funneling $845,000 from Mr. Hofheinz to Mr. Edwards to secure the Jena contract. Mr. Edwards was named an unindicted co-conspirator, and was convicted in a separate bribery trial last May involving the award of a riverboat casino license.</p>
        <p>Wackenhut abandoned the Jena prison last spring after a juvenile court judge in New Orleans and investigators hired by the Justice Department found that the teenage inmates there had been deprived of underwear, sweaters, blankets and food and that a 17-year-old boy had been forced to lie face down on the concrete floor, with a guard's knee in his back, even though he had recently undergone stomach surgery for a gunshot wound and was wearing a colostomy bag. Wackenhut said it would convert Jena to an adult prison, but the building is now empty.</p>
        <p>Bill Lann Lee, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, said the agreement ''does not mean everything will be magically solved.'' But, Mr. Lee said, ''It does mean that there are now over 100 pages of detailed obligations and responsibilities that the State of Louisiana has agreed to, with timetables and mechanisms to make sure they are taken care of.''</p>
        <p>Particularly important, Mr. Lee said, was the role of medical personnel from Louisiana State University.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement, doctors from the university's School of Medicine would provide medical, mental health and dental care at the state's five juvenile prisons, and independent monitors would have the right to inspect the facilities to make sure guards were not beating inmates.</p>
        <p>Staff from the university would also help train guards in an effort to lessen the amount of physical force that has been used, Mr. Lee said.  Other independent monitors, chosen by the Justice Department, Mr. Utter's group and lawyers for other juvenile inmates, would also conduct annual inspections.</p>
        <p>If the problems continue, the agreement allows the Justice Department and the others to file motions to reopen their lawsuits with Judge Frank J. Polozola of Federal District Court in Baton Rouge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee said Judge Polozola, who has overseen prison conditions in Louisiana since 1973, had played a crucial role in reaching the agreement after he ordered all sides last spring to keep talking until a settlement was reached.</p>
        <p>But several lawyers who took part in the talks said that while pressure from Judge Polozola had been helpful, the troubles had taken place during the very time he was supposed to be supervising the juvenile prisons.</p>
