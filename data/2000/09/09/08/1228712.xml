        <p>Mention the name Henson, and the lovable Muppets of ''Sesame Street'' come to mind. But at this time every other year, the family enterprise has another connotation: puppets. The Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater is back, and along with its adult productions, it offers four children's shows and three that bridge the generations.</p>
        <p>This weekend at the Public Theater in Manhattan the Dutch puppeteer Damiet van Dalsum will present ''Hollebollebeer,'' which may sound like the product of a Netherlands brewery, but is actually a whimsical tale about a little boy who lives in a society of bears and longs to fit in.</p>

        <p>Mention the name Henson, and the lovable Muppets of ''Sesame Street'' come to mind. But at this time every other year, the family enterprise has another connotation: puppets. The Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater is back, and along with its adult productions, it offers four children's shows and three that bridge the generations.</p>
        <p>This weekend at the Public Theater in Manhattan the Dutch puppeteer Damiet van Dalsum will present ''Hollebollebeer,'' which may sound like the product of a Netherlands brewery, but is actually a whimsical tale about a little boy who lives in a society of bears and longs to fit in.</p>
        <p>''He ends up embracing his own uniqueness,'' said Cheryl Henson, the festival's executive producer. For ages 5 and up, the production features Ms. van Dalsum's abstract, sculptural figures, which are, as Ms. Henson put it, ''made out of stuff'': wood, metal and found objects.</p>
        <p>From Sept. 15 to 24, Batoto Yetu, a Harlem-based dance troupe, will perform ''The Mukishi'' (ages 6 and up), a celebration of the African spirit with huge masks and puppets, at the New Victory Theater.</p>
        <p>The remaining children's shows, all at the Public, will include a campy ''Sleeping Beauty.'' Presented on Sept. 16 and 17 by the Paul Mesner Puppets, a troupe from Kansas City, Mo., this fairy tale (ages 3 and up) is ''a great romp, with kids cheering for the good guy and booing the bad guy,'' Ms. Henson said.</p>
        <p>''Simple Gifts'' (ages 8 and up), presented by the Cashore Marionettes of Conshohocken, Pa., on Sept. 23 and 24, will consist of individual vignettes by hauntingly lifelike figures.</p>
        <p>The productions for both adults and children are the Mettawee Theater Company's ''Pysche'' (ages 7 and up), this weekend at the Kitchen; ''Hand Shadows/Short Stories'' (ages 10 and up), by Prasanna Rao and Teatro Hugo &amp; Ines, from Sept. 13 to 18 at the Public; and ''The Girl Who Waters Basil and the Nosy Prince'' (ages 7 and up), a Garcia Lorca tale performed by the Cuban Teatro de las Estaciones, from Sept. 20 to 24 at the Public.</p>
        <p>Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater, through Sept. 24. This weekend: ''Hollebollebeer,'' tomorrow at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and Sunday at noon and 2 p.m. at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village,  (212) 260-2400. Tickets: $15. ''Psyche,'' tonight at 7, tomorrow at 1 and 7 p.m. and Sunday at 1 p.m. at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793. Tickets: $25. Orders: (212) 279-4200 (Ticket Central) or www.hensonfestival.org.</p>
        <p>A Time to Remember</p>
        <p>Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, is a time not only to look forward but also to look back. Parents and children can do both on Sunday at the Museum of Jewish Heritage, which will present ''Images of Childhood, a Family Program on the Photography of Roman Vishniac.''</p>
        <p>As Rosh Hashana approaches, said Ivy Barsky, the museum's director of education, ''this is kind of an advance to have kids and their families really assess where they've been and where they're going.''</p>
        <p>The museum's exhibition ''Children of a Vanished World'' features 50 of the photographs Vishniac took of East European Jews in the late 1930's. On assignment for a Jewish relief organization, he captured the lives of poor children as they studied and played, unaware of the shadow that hung over their futures.</p>
        <p>Families will first hear part of ''A Hanukkah Eve in Warsaw,'' a story  by Isaac Bashevis Singer. ''It has a lot of the same imagery,'' Ms. Barsky said. Later they will tour the exhibition and the museum's first floor, looking for objects featured in both men's work, like candlesticks, prayer shawls and the Talmud.</p>
        <p>Finally, the children will create self-portraits, including a significant object from their own lives. The idea is to make connections between all the images they have encountered.</p>
        <p>''They are beautiful photographs,'' Ms. Barsky said, ''and knowing what came later makes them more so.''</p>
        <p>Family program, Sunday at 11:30 a.m. at the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, 18 First Place, at West Street and Battery Place, (212) 968-1800. Free with admission: $7; students and the elderly, $5; under 5, free.</p>
        <p>Dreaming and Doing</p>
        <p>''Imagination'' begins with a familiar scene: children in an advanced state of boredom, clicking the television remote in accompaniment to whines of ''There's nothing to do!'' (Second only to ''Are we there yet?'' for putting parents' teeth on edge.)</p>
        <p>What follows is a tidy little play -- really more a series of exercises -- about what you can do. (Hint: it is strongly related to the title.) Directed by Jennifer Goodlander, ''Imagination'' is 40 or so minutes of interactive fun, with young actors playing the small children's unused imaginations, as well as various colors and some other odd characters.</p>
        <p>Except for a story about a yellow frog, the play, by Elizabeth Anne Keiser, has no narrative. Instead, the cast members ask the audience questions about imagination, act out ideas and play a matching game.</p>
        <p>This is clearly theater for the ''Barney'' set, but what saves it from terminal cuteness is the inventiveness of the actors, who are equally adept at playing milkshakes, jumping beans or running bulls. My 5-year-old paid them high tribute. ''I wish I had their phone numbers,'' he said. ''Then they could baby-sit me.''</p>
        <p>''Imagination,'' Saturdays and Sundays at 2 and 4 p.m. through Oct. 8 at the Looking Glass Theater, 422 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-9467. Tickets: $10; children, $8. Reservations advised.</p>
