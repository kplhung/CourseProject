        <p>The New York State Public Service Commission yesterday postponed for up to four months refunds of more than $100 million that Consolidated Edison must give its customers as a result of an accident at one of its generating plants.</p>
        <p>After Gov. George E.

        <p>The New York State Public Service Commission yesterday postponed for up to four months refunds of more than $100 million that Consolidated Edison must give its customers as a result of an accident at one of its generating plants.</p>
        <p>After Gov. George E. Pataki signed a bill last month requiring the refunds, state officials said they would result in an average $14 credit for residential customers in New York and a $21 average for residential customers in Westchester. The refunds were to make up for charges customers paid to reimburse Con Ed for the cost of replacement power after an accident in February shut down the Indian Point 2 nuclear-powered generator in Westchester.</p>
        <p>Two consumer advocates in state government then disagreed on whether the refunds should be made this month, as the commission originally directed, or in December or January. The state's Consumer Protection Board urged a delay, saying  it would be more beneficial to consumers to get the refunds this winter, when they might offset an expected increase in the cost of electricity. Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer opposed a delay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer said last night that he was considering a court challenge to the decision.</p>
