        <p>The rear fender of a parked Ford was first base in those days, the tire well of a Chrysler was the hot corner and a sewer lid was second base. Apartment buildings doubled for outfield fences, and their fire escapes were bleacher seats for the neighborhood crowd.</p>
        <p>The players would name one tall building at the end of the block Ebbets Field; another, Tiger Stadium; and so forth. Hit a spaldeen onto one of those roofs, and it was like homering in the big leagues.</p>
        <p>In the 1940's and early 50's, stickball was just about the best game there was. It was poor man's baseball, with no need for huge, grassy fields or expensive bats and balls, and it was played in every borough,  with some neighborhoods having two or three teams to a block. Games would start after school and end because of darkness or occasionally because of a broken window. When a policeman confiscated a stick, someone would be sent scampering to his mother's broom closet for a new one. The local druggist or butcher or bookie would wager on the score, and if your team won you might have enough money to go to the movies.</p>
        <p>''You would jump right on top of a car to catch a ball,'' said Nelson Roldan, one of the game's legends, who has been playing for more than 30 years in the Bronx. ''The poor owner would come down and there'd be all kinds of dents in the car. That's how it was.''</p>
        <p>Today's generation remembers nothing of that era, of course. In the last 50 years most streets have become too congested or dangerous to play in. When stickballers grew up and had families, their sons played Little League baseball. Their children, in turn, play basketball or soccer.</p>
        <p>But stickball has not disappeared. You can find a random game in pockets of Park Slope and Washington Heights. In Astoria children play strike box, using a rubber baseball and a square strike zone painted on a school or handball wall.</p>
        <p>But there are only two places in New York City where stickball is a constant. The first is El Barrio, Spanish Harlem, where pitching-in games (pitchers try to bounce balls past hitters) are played in the neighborhood of East 110th Street. The other is in the Bronx, where self-hit, bounce-and-swing games without a pitcher are played on a street with the sweetest of names, Stickball Boulevard. My story begins there.</p>
        <p>It is a hazy, sweltering summer day, but that isn't why my palms are sweaty. I am standing alone in the middle of a traffic-free street with a small racquetball-size rubber ball in one hand and a four-foot-long blue-and-yellow striped wooden stick in the other. Eight men wearing red and silver jerseys are scattered across the asphalt before me. A few are at the far end of the block, several hundred feet away. Every one of them is yelling at me, and their words aren't exactly encouraging. ''Rookie! Rookie!'' one chant begins. ''Whaddayah got?'' the Youngbloods' third baseman screams. ''Nothin'!'' cries another of his teammates. ''I've seen better swings in a park!''</p>
        <p>Taking a deep, nervous breath, I squeeze the pink ball in my hand and bounce it once on the pavement, cocking my arms back and striding forward to enter my swing. I twist my hips and wrists and the thin stick whooshes through the air, meeting the ball with a tiny ping! The ball sputters upward, then backward, landing in foul territory and bouncing to the gutter. I grimace hard and shut my eyes as if in pain. In the game of stickball, one foul and you're out.</p>
        <p>''You see, Petey,'' Lenny Santiago, player-coach of my adoptive team, the Aces, says as we jog to our positions a few moments later. ''It's not as easy as it looks.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, I had envisioned a more glorious first at bat for my stickball career. Having played baseball four years in high school and three in college in the early 90's, what could be easier for me than hitting a rubber ball out of my hand, I thought? Daydreaming on the No. 6 train to 177th Street that morning, I imagined hitting the ball hard enough to leave a skidmark on the pavement or sending one halfway to Westchester. At the very least, I thought I'd hit a double.</p>
        <p>But after seven humbling innings, I learned that stickball was no day in the park.</p>
        <p>The trouble is, a stickball isn't at all like a baseball. The ball is smaller -- about 2 inches in diameter -- and lighter. And because Bronx players inject it with butane for added spunk, it can bounce higher than a telephone pole. It has long replaced the once popular spaldeen, the pink rubber ball made by the Spalding company whose current version is considered by many players to lack the zip of its fabled predecessor. Line drives with a stickball that start out knee-high can suddenly curve up and over an infielder's head. With the wind blowing out, a high fly ball can carry an extra 20 or 30 feet -- trust me -- and is apt to slice left or right like a wayward golf ball.</p>
        <p>Chop at the ball when swinging, and it will wiggle in the air like a hard-boiled egg in flight, making it difficult for fielders, who play without gloves, to grab. Such a ball is, in fact, called an egg ball. Add storm drains, dips and bumps in the pavement, sidewalk curbings, fences, trees and buildings, which are all in play, and you have a game as predictable as the lottery.</p>
        <p>Hit a ball over the chain-link fences that line the sides of Stickball Boulevard and you've fouled out. On defense, if a line drive past third base is low enough, it will smack the black iron fence that fronts P.S. 182 and ricochet toward second.</p>
        <p>If your second baseman isn't paying attention, or -- as was my case --  has no clue that stickballs bounce at bizarre angles, he's going to miss it.</p>
        <p>In such situations, I was told, experience is about the only thing that can help.</p>
        <p>As it turns out, most of Stickball Boulevard's players have plenty. Half the league's players are about 50 and have been members of the eight-team, Bronx-based New York Emperors Stickball League since its inception in 1985, when it obtained permission from the city to close the street during game time.</p>
        <p>Before games, players tape their ankles, ice their shoulders and pop Advils. Each team plays two seven-inning games on Sunday. When players aren't in the field they sit in folding chairs along the sidewalk, have beers, burgers or Spanish pastelillos -- meat tarts -- and talk about retirement or their kids. They also reminisce about the old days, when teams like the 60's Boys, Minton's Playhouse, the Dandies and Home Reliefs dominated stickball and sluggers like Willie Bouncer Pizarroz and Charlie Ballard, who still plays at the age of 83, sent spaldeens flying into oblivion.</p>
        <p>By the end of my first stickball game, however, I had given up on sending anything into oblivion. I was 0-for-3 with a foul ball out, a caught egg ball and an infield ground out. Defensively, I played second base with the finesse of an outfielder, which is my natural baseball position, forgetting to cover first on infield rollers and windmilling the tiny ball over the third-baseman's head during warm-ups. By the third inning he was no longer talking to me.</p>
        <p>Dropping my baseball smugness, I set new goals for Game 2: A) Get a hit. B) Don't blow the game for my team, which was vying for a playoff spot. Henry Caban, our first baseman, told me to relax and bounce the ball a few times before swinging. ''This is an old man's game,'' he said. ''Don't rush it.'' Another veteran reminded me to keep my front shoulder in. Billy Friend, who is 76 and  began his stickball career in 1931, told me to aim for Stickball Boulevard's trees. ''They can't catch it in the trees,'' he said in his raspy voice. ''It always drops.''</p>
        <p>I didn't hit it in the trees, but the next time up I rapped a hard grounder past the third baseman that went for a single. In the field I felt more comfortable, too, handling my only chance with relative ease. That day, I was a rookiesque 1-for-4 and made no major gaffes. My team did not fare well, though, dropping the morning game by a 7-0 score and the afternoon game 4-0. Still, after each loss, Coach Santiago called a huddle and said a few encouraging words, reminding everyone that we were there to have fun.</p>
        <p>I returned the next Sunday for  more childhood stories and another game. I played sparingly because our team was overloaded with 12 players, although as a pinch-runner, I scored our only run. Later that afternoon Carlos Diaz, a founder of the East Harlem National Stickball League, drove me around El Barrio, pointing out stickball fields on a half-dozen streets. Like Stickball Boulevard, each had yellow squares for bases, white foul lines cutting diagonally across sidewalks and chalk scoreboards on the pavement.</p>
        <p>At the end of the tour he took me to the Old Timers, Young Devils team clubhouse on 115th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, where hundreds of photos of stickball players from the last 70 years are pinned to the walls -- stickball's Cooperstown, if you will.</p>
        <p>My experience with the Aces, for sure, was not the stuff of legend. Still, I feel that I've joined a special brotherhood, one whose members fear storm drains when rounding third base and relish the sting of a rubber ball against the flesh. I even know what an egg ball looks like. Now, where did I put my broom?</p>
        <p>Batter Up!</p>
        <p>You can get in a game at Stickball Boulevard starting  on Sunday and the next three  Sundays. Games begin about noon and are played through the day until 3 p.m. Teams will be determined when players arrive.</p>
