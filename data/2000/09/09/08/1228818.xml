        <p>A United Airlines passenger plane leaving Los Angeles for Boston today was forced to take evasive action when it came too close to an Air Force stealth fighter shortly after takeoff, airline and federal officials said.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred at 8:43 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time as the passenger plane, United Airlines Flight 174, was climbing to 15,000 feet from Los Angeles International Airport. The anticollision device in the plane's cockpit detected an approaching aircraft and issued an alert, said Chris Brathwaite, an airline spokesman.</p>
        <p>The United pilot, who saw the F117 stealth fighter jet, responded by dropping to 10,800 feet, Mr. Brathwaite said. There were 166 passengers and 7 crew members aboard the Boeing 757, he said.</p>
        <p>''The Air Force jet passed overhead, and our flight continued to Boston without incident,'' Mr. Brathwaite said.</p>
        <p>Eliot B. Brenner, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said the aircraft came within 500 feet vertically of each other but were about two-thirds of a mile apart horizontally.</p>
        <p>''The collision avoidance system worked as designed and the two aircraft were never in serious conflict,'' Mr. Brenner said. The F.A.A. is investigating the incident, he said.</p>
        <p>The F-117 is considered the most sophisticated jet in the American arsenal. It can evade most radar, but  is generally visible to anticollision devices.</p>
