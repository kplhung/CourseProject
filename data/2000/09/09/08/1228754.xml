        <p>It was in the meeting rooms that the linebackers vented. Their unease with a new defensive coaching staff bubbled to the surface. Their questions and doubts tumbled out for all to hear.</p>
        <p>With the return to Giants Stadium Monday night of the former Jets defensive guru Bill Belichick as the head coach of the Patriots, the defense he once masterminded has attracted an unusual level of attention. It hasn't helped that the Jets' defense has gone through adjustment pains this summer as awkward as a teenager enduring a growth spurt.</p>
        <p>Mike Nolan, the new defensive coordinator, was in the unusual position of having to take over the defense Belichick devised rather than imposing his own scheme. When the defense suffered through a disappointing preseason, it sparked concern that the players' lack of familiarity with each other might be hindering the unit's performance.</p>
        <p>But when the Jets held a Green Bay offense, led by a hampered Brett Favre, to just 211 yards total offense, it seemed a soothing validation, at least for the first week, that perhaps the worst of the adjustment period was past.</p>
        <p>''It was a little difficult during the summer,'' linebacker Dwayne Gordon said. ''It didn't have anything to do with Mike more than it was players adjusting to change and having new guys to listen to. The terminology might have been different or the coaches might have come across from a viewpoint you might not understand.</p>
        <p>''Being the stubborn old guys like we have on our defense, we're used to doing things a certain way and when you do things in a different way -- and sometimes in practice it might not work -- you start to doubt what's going on.</p>
        <p>''Once we got that squared away in camp, things started to run a little more smoothly. Now, we're rolling. It's a very open deal. We all want to win here. So if we see something we might not like, we're going to say something.''</p>
        <p>Coach Al Groh, who has spent considerable time working with the defense, went out of his way to say that he liked how Nolan called Sunday's game, pointing out that Nolan did not make many adjustments during the game, allowing the players to continue to work with the original simple game plan. Belichick, on the other hand, was known for his ability to adjust on the fly.</p>
        <p>Most of the defensive players still revere Belichick, and Gordon admitted that some of the changes in approach and attitude with a new cast of coaches were sometimes hard for the linebackers -- the deepest and best defensive unit -- to take.</p>
        <p>The meetings with the linebackers coach, Bob Sutton, frequently became animated, a ''caucus'' of open discussion and, occasionally, dissenting opinions. The meetings did not become heated, Gordon said, but they did work. Defensive lineman Rick Lyle said that, after a slow start, the feeling-out period is over between coaches and players.</p>
        <p>''I think everybody is comfortable now,'' Lyle said. ''Guys are understanding where coaches are coming from. We're starting to jell.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the comfort level is likely to be directly proportional to the team's most recent performance, and this week, the Jets will face Drew Bledsoe. Tampa Bay, the Patriots' first opponent, has the best defense in the league, and they needed no more than a five-man rush to sack Bledsoe a career-high six times.</p>
        <p>The Jets will certainly try to bring pressure on Bledsoe, but Nolan is unlikely to employ a radically different defense than the basic one the Jets run. Some people derisively call it a vanilla defense and doubt how effective it can be for the long term. The Jets do not seem concerned.</p>
        <p>''We didn't do a lot of things last Sunday,'' cornerback Marcus Coleman said. ''We play to our strengths. We don't need to do anything overly exotic to hide weaknesses. Vanilla, base, whatever works, works. Whatever is going on, not just in football but in life, you go back to basics. You always go back to fundamentals.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Running back CURTIS MARTIN is expected to return to full practice Friday, Coach AL GROH said. Martin, who sustained a sprained knee in the Green Bay game, has not practiced this week. . . . Left tackle JASON FABINI, who endured a four-penalty game against Green Bay, is still practicing with the first team offensive line, although Groh has remained coy about whether Fabini will start Sunday. ''I expect to be perfect,'' Fabini said. ''Every player expects to be. When you're not, it's disappointing.'' . . . The Jets added the first-year tackle CORNELL GREEN to the practice squad and terminated the contract of tackle JEFF PILON.</p>
