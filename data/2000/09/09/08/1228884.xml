        <p>BEAUTYMAN-William, M.D. Of Blue Bell, PA and Winter Harbor, ME, died on September 5, 2000, of prostate cancer. Born in Northumberland, England on January 4, 1920, he took top honors at Christ College, Cambridge University and received medical training at University College and St. Bartholomew's Hospitals in London. After serving as a Captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps in the Mediterranean during WW II, he came to the U.S. in 1951 and became Chief Pathologist, Director of Laboratories and Chairman of the Pathology Department at Berkshire Medical Center in Pittsfield, MA. There, in 1957, he created a freestanding Residency Program in Pathology that maintained its accreditation throughout the 35 years of his leadership. He was also praised for the early introduction of computers and molecular genetics into the pathology laboratory. Private passions included studying the lives of Sir Thomas More and Cardinal John Newman and the works of Shakespeare. He is survived by his sons William, Jr. of Stockbridge, MA, and Michael of Flourtown, PA, his daughter Elizabeth of New York City, and four grandchildren. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to Winter Harbor Public Library C/O Alan Smallidge, Treasurer, Winter Harbor, ME. 04693.</p>
