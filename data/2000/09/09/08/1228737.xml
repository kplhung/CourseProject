        <p>A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* ADVENTURES IN STEREO, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. Pull yourself away from that Audrey Hepburn flick on cable and head down to a show where winsome chic still rules. Adventures in Stereo is, at its core, Jim Beattie (formerly of Primal Scream) and the singer Judith Boyle. This Scottish group recreates the sounds of Swinging London under a Henry Mancini moon. Sharing the bill are the Waxwings, a Detroit group that does something sweet with its Beach Boys fixation, and Chamber Strings, the new group in which the former Rosehips leader Kevin Junior expresses his fondness for the Rolling Stones. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $12 (Ann Powers).</p>

        <p>* ADVENTURES IN STEREO, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. Pull yourself away from that Audrey Hepburn flick on cable and head down to a show where winsome chic still rules.

Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $12 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>ANTI-POP CONSORTIUM, PRINCESS SUPERSTAR, Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 229-0785. The ambitious underground hip-hop of the Anti-Pop Consortium arrives in a flood of polysyllables. Over the laconic, dislocated beats of E. Blaize, the rappers Priest, Beans and M. Sayyid wrap both stories and self-promotion in similes and allusions so fast and densely packed they could use an instant replay. Tomorrow at 11 p.m.; admission is $10 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>DICKEY BETTS, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y., (516) 334-0800. Kicked out of a band that he founded, the Allman Brothers, the guitarist Dickey Betts has wasted no time in going back on tour with his own group. His chiming, symmetrical guitar solos and the weary but amiable voice from songs like ''Blue Skies'' should be intact; he may even have something to prove. Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $32.50. He is also performing in Manhattan on Wednesday at 8 p.m. at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800; tickets are $25 in advance, $30 on Wednesday (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* BOUKMAN EKSPERYANS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Boukman Eksperyans went to the Haitian countryside to collect the Afro-Haitian rhythms of rural voodoo and carnival music. Then it added electric guitars and lyrics hinting at revolutionary messages and reshaped a generation of Haitian rock. Tonight at 10; tickets are $8 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>VINICIUS CANTUARIA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7504. Vinicius Cantuaria is steeped in the bossa nova: its gently brushed guitar chords, its quietly elaborate melodies, its shades of sensuality and melancholy. He knows it well enough to stretch the form without losing its essence. For these shows he is playing acoustic guitar with two percussionists. Tonight at 8 and 10; admission is $12 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MARIANNE FAITHFULL, Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, 68th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, Manhattan, (212) 772-4448. Marianne Faithfull applies her husky ruin of a voice to songs about harrowing moments and bitter realizations. In songs she wrote herself or chose with exacting standards, she reveals every scar with bleak fascination and no regrets. Shows are tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $40 and $50 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>TOMMY FLANAGAN TRIO, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. The great postwar mainstream jazz pianist, one of the seedlings sent here from Detroit in the 1950's, has given New York several decades' worth of consummate small-group craftsmanship, balancing improvisation and delicate form in bebop, Ellingtonia, song standards and his originals. Sets through Sunday are at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m.; $20 cover for tonight and tomorrow and $15 for Sunday; $10 minimum all nights (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>FOLK PARKS, Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 571-1555. The Center for Traditional Music and Dance digs out the musical legacies that are usually hidden in New York City's immigrant neighborhoods. Its annual extravaganza goes globe-hopping with an extraordinary variety of music. Tomorrow from 1 to 7 p.m., it includes music from the Carpathian Mountains of Eastern Europe by the group Cheres; Filipino tribal dance by Bibak; American Indian dance by the Thunderbird Dancers; drumming and dance from Senegal by Mar Gueye and N'Geuwel, with the machine-gun rhythms of the sabar drum; Korean drumming and dance, with gongs and long twirling plumes, from Hanguk; Irish jigs and reels and step-dancing by Cherish the Ladies; and Dominican merengue by David-David. There will be room to dance and workshops in African, Irish and Dominican steps, beginning at 3 p.m., and from noon to 1 p.m. the Thunderbird Dancers and Hanguk will give demonstrations for children. Free; rain date is Sunday (Pareles).</p>
        <p>FURTHUR 2000, Continental Airlines Arena, off Route 3, East Rutherford, N.J. (201) 935-3900. When Jerry Garcia died in 1995, his bandmates retired the name the Grateful Dead. But some of them couldn't stay off the road, so they formed the Other Ones and put together package tours under the name Furthur, taken from the destination sign on Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters bus. While Phil Lesh has since spun off his own Dead repertory band, Bob Weir and Mickey Hart of the Dead and their longtime guest musician, Bruce Hornsby, have taken on new guitarists to jam on Dead songs with the Other Ones. This year's Furthur tour includes the positive thinking and lean reggae grooves of Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers. Sunday at 6:30 p.m.; tickets are $29.50 and $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>GIPSY KINGS, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Strumming half a dozen guitars, singing in a husky rasp and stamping their heels on the floor, this French pop group is to flamenco what Rice-a-Roni is to paella. Which is not to say that some of their international hits, like ''Bamboleo,'' aren't fiendishly catchy. Sunday at 7:30 p.m.; tickets are $35 to $80. Also Tuesday and Wednesday at Radio City Music Hall, 1260 Avenue of the Americas, at 50th Street,  (212) 307-7171; tickets are $38 to $78 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>EL GRAN COMBO, DOMINGO QUINONES, Latin Quarter, 2551 Broadway, at 96th Street, (212) 864-7600. Formed in 1962 and on the Latin charts consistently ever since, El Gran Combo has (along with Sonora Poncena) become one of Puerto Rico's definitive salsa bands, pitching eager romance amid hard-driving percussion and horns. It trades sets with Domingo Quinones, a singer who made salsa fans take notice when he convincingly impersonated the late Hector Lavoe, one of New York's most revered salsa singers, in the Off Broadway production ''Quien Mato a Hector Lavoe?'' Tomorrow about midnight; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>ANDREW HILL SEXTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. Buoyed by ''Dusk'' (Palmetto), Mr. Hill's first new recording in a decade, this band has been playing quite a lot, sounding better and better.  First and foremost, Mr. Hill is a formidable composer; he writes multipart pieces that jostle your mood, then he soothes you with a romantic streak. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $25, with $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* HOMOCORPS, CBGB, 315 Bowery, between First and Second Streets, East Village, (212) 982-4052. Feeling a little drab, what with September upon us? Get out that glitter outfit in the back of the closet and head down to this celebration of fabulous gay rock 'n' roll. Kevin Aviance will probably have the best outfit, performing his dance club hits like ''Din Da Da.'' Rufus Wainwright will be the wittiest and may attract the most avid fans. Bullet, Morplay and Yoland and the Plastic Family will all vie for attention. But Dean Johnson, the veteran scene-maker who organized this fest, will be the most outrageous, leading his band, the Velvet Mafia, in a stunning white wedding dress. Tomorrow at 9 p.m.; tickets are $12 (Powers).</p>
        <p>KROSFYAH, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Krosfyah, from Barbados, galvanizes the dance floor without leaving behind calypso's tradition of social commentary. With a drummer who could hold his own against a drum machine at any speed, Krosfyah whips up frenetic, unstoppable grooves, pushing soca toward its fastest tempos while its party chants equate positive thoughts with hip-swiveling locomotion. Tonight at midnight and 2 a.m.; admission is $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JOE LOVANO AND GREG OSBY, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. The two saxophonists teamed up to make one of the better records of last year, ''Friendly Fire'' (Blue Note/Capitol). Their drastically different styles create drama: Mr. Lovano is warm and expansive, Mr. Osby, s tight and coiled (though they can switch sides, too). They're both among the greatest players of the day, and this special-edition band, given to intuitive form, has a great rhythm section, including the pianist Jason Moran, the bassist Cameron Brown and the drummer Idris Muhammad. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8:30, 10:30 and 12:15; Sunday night's sets are at 8:30 and 10:30; cover charge is $25 with a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>HAROLD MABERN SEXTET, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, near Seventh Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. Mr. Mabern is from Memphis and plays with a blues-bebop feel; he also has big hands, and he's a powerful pianist. In his band is the young tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander, who has been busy apprenticing with him and other bluesy musicians like him through this last decade. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $15 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* PAUL MOTIAN ELECTRIC BEBOP BAND, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Mr. Motian, the great drummer whose reputation goes back to Bill Evans's old trio as well as Keith Jarrett's American band in the 60's, loves changing texture in each bar, and he has a curious approach to old tunes by Monk, Mingus, Parker: there are four lead instruments in the band, sending out a dense thicket of lines and counterlines. It's a band that interesting young musicians love to play in. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow, $17.50 on Sunday; $10 minimum all nights (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* NEW YORK SALSA FESTIVAL, Madison Square Garden, Seventh Avenue at 33rd Street, (212) 465-6741. The 25th annual New York Salsa Festival is a tribute to Tito Puente, who died in June. Mr. Puente and his peer, the pianist Eddie Palmieri, had just finished making their only collaborative album, ''Masterpiece.'' For this concert, Mr. Puente's band and Mr. Palmieri's band -- two of the brassiest, most galvanizing ensembles in salsa history -- will merge to perform music from ''Masterpiece.'' The concert's lineup also includes the invincible Cuban singer Celia Cruz, the Venezuelan singer and bandleader Oscar D'Leon and others, including Tito Nieves, Tony Vega, Domingo Quinones and Johnny Rivera. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $40 to $75 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* PEOPLE'S PARTY, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Though gangsta rap shows no signs of giving up its commercial dominance, some hip-hop thinkers refuse to stay within that niche. This show brings together rappers who want to hold on to some of hip-hop's other prerogatives, including political activism, social observations and speedy, good-humored wordplay. The lineup includes Hip-M-1 of Deat Prez, Black Thought from the Roots, Jeru the Damaja, Steele from the Cocoa Brovaz, Killah Priest, formerly of the Sunz of Man, and DJ Toni Touch. Sunday at 9 p.m.; tickets are $15 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>KARLA SCHICKELE, ROSE THOMSON, DUCKS IN THE POND, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Those who can't get enough of Ida, the chamber pop group, can continue to enjoy its mellow style at this show featuring Karla Schickele, who plays bass in the band. She shares the stage with Rose Thomson, bassist for another popular New York outfit, Babe the Blue Ox. Ducks in the Pond features other Ida and Babe collaborators edging toward funkiness. Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $7 (Powers).</p>
        <p>COMPAY SEGUNDO, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824. Francisco Repilado is better known as Compay Segundo for his long career as a harmony singer, or second (segundo) vocalist. He wrote ''Chan Chan,'' the calling card of the Buena Vista Social Club. On his own, he is a living link to music from before World War II: the old Cuban son and bolero. In his gentle, old-fashioned group, clarinets and his own armoico, a little seven-stringed guitar, interlace their lines with the singers' tales of lost love; the music is courtly and haunting. Tonight at 8; tickets are $37.50 and $42.50 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* RON SEXSMITH, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Last seen singing in Steve Nieve's opera at Town Hall this summer, the superb Canadian troubadour focuses on his own incomparably graceful songs tonight. It's likely that he will perform new material from his recent sessions in Nashville, where Steve Earle and Ray Kennedy have been sharing production skills and inspiration. It's just as safe to bet that someone will shout out for ''Secret Heart'' and that Mr. Sexsmith, sweetie that he is, will play it. With Peter Stuart. Sunday at 8:30 p.m.; tickets are $12 (Powers).</p>
        <p>KOKO TAYLOR, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Koko Taylor's big, raspy voice blasts through her blues tunes like a sandstorm. She is fond of tunes full of male braggadocio, like ''Wang Dang Doodle,'' and she is as tough as anyone who has ever sung them. Tonight and tomorrow night at 10; admission is $35 and $10 minimum (Pareles).</p>
        <p>UNWOUND, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 420-8392. The mystique of Unwound has to do with purity, and this Pacific Northwest-based trio translates purity into noise. Few underground rock bands are so committed to plumbing the crevasses of feedback and plain volume; Unwound pushes hard enough toward atonality that the din becomes surprisingly beautiful. These shows, including a sold-out performance tomorrow night, are sponsored by Insound and Planetour. The other shows are tomorrow at 3 p.m. with Tara Jane O'Neil and Lo-Hi, and Sunday at 8 p.m. with Convocation of . . . and Mercury Program. Admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* BRIAN WILSON, Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, N.Y., (516) 221-1000. The Beach Boys' ''Pet Sounds,'' released in 1966, was an album that changed the direction of 60's rock as Brian Wilson cloistered himself in the recording studio and let his imagination roam. The songs that emerged were about loneliness, transcendence, complex harmonies and orchestral dreams. Battling his longtime stage fright, Mr. Wilson has enlisted the Long Island Philharmonic to perform the album's lush yet fragile songs onstage. Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $30 to $49 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>STEVE WILSON QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. It's good to have Mr. Wilson's band performing again; as an alto saxophonist, he is so busy with other bands -- these days, his main employer is Chick Corea -- that one seldom hears him as a leader anymore. His sound is warm, light-toned, fleet; he has dealt with the living landmarks of his instrument, Ornette Coleman and Wayne Shorter, as well as anyone out there today. His band, made of musicians who have spent considerable time in one another's company, is especially reactive: it includes the pianist Bruce Barth, the bassist Eric Revis and the drummer Adam Cruz. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $15 and $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
