        <p>First came the tax returns.</p>
        <p>In just one afternoon in a week that he will not soon forget, Larry B. Seabrook saw his race for Congress rocked by a tabloid revelation that he had filed joint tax returns even after he and his wife were divorced. There was the added tidbit that both Mr. Seabrook, a state senator from the Bronx, and his former wife maintained that they were unaware of their divorce until years after it became official. The day wasn't over yet, and neither was his opponent, who accused the senator of breaking the law and called for a criminal investigation.</p>
        <p>It was in that same tumultuous week that Mr. Seabrook went on to accuse his opponent, United States Representative Eliot L. Engel, of being so conniving and desperate to win re-election that he had illegally obtained the information from sealed divorce records and leaked it to the news media. And it was during that week that Mr. Seabrook said he would go to court himself to seek criminal charges against Mr. Engel for illegally obtaining his most private information.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook then took his complaints to the doorstep of Mr. Engel's office, holding a news conference to accuse his opponent of a list of misdeeds. But Mr. Seabrook was ultimately upstaged by a woman who brought the news conference to a screeching halt by falling to the ground and screaming incoherently about being Mr. Seabrook's wife. That sent a frightened Mr. Seabrook dashing from the scene, fearful, he said, that the woman might have been carrying a weapon.</p>
        <p>As that single week in its life would indicate, this primary battle in the 17th Congressional District, which includes parts of the Bronx and some of Westchester County, is not your typical political contest. With a seemingly endless stream of vitriol, the campaign has provided voters with a box-seat view of everything from charges of racism on one hand to anti-Semitism on the other. There have been accusations of sabotage from one side, of malfeasance from the other; complaints about political betrayal from one camp and of demagoguery from the other. And added to that mix have been enough revelations about Mr. Seabrook's marital woes to provide a season's worth of scripts for a soap opera.</p>
        <p>The race features Mr. Engel, a 53-year-old white incumbent, who is working feverishly -- some say desperately -- to get re-elected in a district whose demographics have shifted dramatically, from the mostly white electorate that first sent him to Congress 12 years ago to its current overwhelmingly black and brown majority.</p>
        <p>And it is also the story of Mr. Seabrook, 49, a black state senator, who has invoked the theme of black political empowerment in a campaign that has been marred by a string of embarrassing revelations that have portrayed him as acting injudiciously at best -- and illegally at worst.</p>
        <p>''It is not a pretty thing to watch,'' said J. Philip Thompson, a professor of political science at Columbia University. ''The effect of all this activity has been to push issues completely out of the campaign. This is a district that has a crime problem and a drug problem,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''There are important issues regarding job opportunities, and how to provide them. But none of that is really being addressed in this campaign. It's more like some strange circus. And for most voters, it's disheartening and discouraging.''</p>
        <p>It has also been highly political. For years, Mr. Engel, who was first elected in 1988, has been preparing for the possibility of a challenge by Mr. Seabrook. In previous election years, Mr. Seabrook, whose State Senate district covers about half of the Congressional district, talked  about running for the seat, only to change his mind before the nominating petitions were due.</p>
        <p>But this year was different.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook said he had long watched the changing demographics of the district and concluded that a black candidate could win the seat, based on the minority population. The 17th Congressional District was about 60 percent white when Mr. Engel first ran. But it is now only about 22 percent white, with the balance being mostly black and Hispanic.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Seabrook has criticized Mr. Engel as an inattentive incumbent who spends far more time at his home in Maryland than in the district. And he has routinely ridiculed Mr. Engel, saying that the congressman's major accomplishment had been to get to the House of Representatives chamber early enough each January to get an aisle seat during the State of the Union message so that he could be seen on national television shaking the president's hand.</p>
        <p>Having raised more than $100,000, Mr. Seabrook entered the race this year with his slogan of ''History in the Making,'' his campaign's expressed proposition of electing the first black congressman to represent  the Bronx.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Seabrook was busy putting together his campaign for Congress, Mr. Engel's aides were also busy, collecting information on Mr. Seabrook. They chronicled, for example, Mr. Seabrook's attendance record in the State Senate and his high rate of absenteeism. They gathered records indicating that Mr. Seabrook sought reimbursement for travel expenses to Albany for more days than the Senate was in session.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Engel -- and not a few of his supporters -- suggested that, in appealing to black pride, Mr. Seabrook had injected race into the campaign in a bold and racist appeal to black voters.</p>
        <p>The next shoe to drop came at the hands of the Democratic organization in the Bronx. Mr. Seabrook, who has long had an arm's-length relationship with the party, was suddenly endorsed by its chairman, Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez. Mr. Ramirez, who had never before withheld his support from a Democratic incumbent congressman, explained his decision by saying that Mr. Engel had grown ineffective and that he had gotten out of touch with the district's constituents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Engel responded by suggesting that Mr. Ramirez's decision was based more on ethnic politics. He said that Mr. Ramirez had entered a deal under which Mr. Seabrook's endorsement by the party would require the senator to publicly support the mayoral bid of Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president. That move, Mr. Engel reasoned, would draw Seabrook supporters -- meaning black voters -- to Mr. Ferrer's camp.</p>
        <p>More stinging, however, was the charge by some of Mr. Engel's supporters that the endorsement was an anti-Jewish maneuver, aimed at sabotaging the career of a promising liberal representative. Mr. Engel lent his own voice to that view, even suggesting that Hillary Rodham Clinton was harming her standing with Jewish voters by not supporting him (Mrs. Clinton has refused to take sides in contested Democratic primary races).</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the race has split Democrats in the district and beyond. Mr. Engel has been endorsed by former Mayor Edward I. Koch, as well as the Democratic Party organization of Westchester County. Mr. Seabrook has been endorsed by the Rev. Al Sharpton, as well as most Democratic officials in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>There is a third candidate in the race: Arsenio Zayas, 59, a former police officer and retired lawyer.</p>
        <p>At times in their campaigns, Mr. Engel and Mr. Seabrook have discussed views they have in common. They talk about the need to lower class sizes, for example, or to find money to rehabilitate the schools in the district, to support federal initiatives to make health care more widely available and to enhance economic opportunities for small businesses in  the district. But they have been far more vocal in their condemnation of each other.</p>
        <p>Many of the dozens of pieces of campaign literature Mr. Engel has sent to voters bear nothing about voting for the congressman's re-election. Instead, many are devoted entirely to exposing what they say are Mr. Seabrook's flaws and ethical troubles. And Mr. Seabrook shares with anyone who will listen his description of Mr. Engel as being chronically absent from the district and unconcerned about its voters.</p>
        <p>''Eliot Engel offers nothing to the people of this district,'' Mr. Seabrook said. ''To those of us who live here, he is a ghost.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Engel has a ready retort.  ''Larry Seabrook is the biggest scofflaw in the New York State Legislature,'' the congressman said this week. ''He fails to file campaign disclosure information, and there is always some ethical cloud hanging around his head,'' Mr. Engel said.  ''He is the one going around saying that he should be elected because he is black. He started this campaign on a negative note.''</p>
        <p>All that said, both men deny that they are operating negative campaigns.</p>
        <p>''Throughout this campaign, I have stressed the positive things in my record,'' Mr. Engel insisted. ''And I think things are going very positively for me. I have been talking to people about the fact that I have put in more than $200 million into this district in the last four years. And I talk to people about the fact that I have five district offices, which is more than any other member of Congress from New York.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Engel has denied having any responsibility for disseminating information about Mr. Seabrook's taxes or his divorce. Still, it is clear that many voters, particularly black and Hispanic ones in the district, find that difficult to believe.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people in the community believe that Mr. Engel bears responsibility for the negative tone of the campaign,'' said City Councilman Adolfo Carrion Jr., who represents the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx. ''Early on, they sent out a barrage of negative campaign literature. And that set the tone.''</p>
        <p>And many other voters, particularly white ones, see Mr. Seabrook as a divisive figure, more inclined to rely on race than merit in presenting himself before the voters.</p>
        <p>''Many people in this area believe he is running for the wrong reason,'' said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, an Engel supporter who represents the Riverdale and Kingsbridge areas of the Bronx. ''And that reason is simply demographics.''</p>
        <p>To many Democrats in the district and beyond, the biggest question is how either will be able to emerge after the primary election on Tuesday as a unifying voice, regardless of the outcome. All of this has made this unusual and peculiar campaign something that many politicians and voters are already lamenting, despite the uncertainty of its outcome.</p>
        <p>''This race has been mostly about mudslinging,'' said the Rev. Hillary Gaston, the pastor of the Parkchester Baptist Church in the Bronx. ''Neither one of them has put forth a meaningful agenda that would excite anyone. People want to know, 'What are you doing for our community?' ''</p>
