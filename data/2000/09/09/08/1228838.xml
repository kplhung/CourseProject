        <p>Robin Ventura, New York Mets third baseman, has had disappointing .226 batting average this year; he is hoping his contributions on defense will help make up for lackluster hitting this season (M)</p>

        <p>With a .226 batting average, Robin Ventura accepts that the math is against him. Time has run out for Ventura, the Mets' third baseman, to raise his average to its normal level, which hovers around .277 for his career. Almost certainly, this will go down as the worst offensive season of his distinguished career.</p>
        <p>''At this point in the season, my numbers aren't going to change that much,'' Ventura said before the Mets' last game, an 11-8 loss at Cincinnati on Wednesday, which ended a miserable road trip. ''People are still going to say this was a bad season. But in my mind, if you help the team from this point forward, it doesn't matter what the numbers are.''</p>

        <p>With a .226 batting average, Robin Ventura accepts that the math is against him. Time has run out for Ventura, the Mets' third baseman, to raise his average to its normal level, which hovers around .277 for his career. Almost certainly, this will go down as the worst offensive season of his distinguished career.</p>
        <p>''At this point in the season, my numbers aren't going to change that much,'' Ventura said before the Mets' last game, an 11-8 loss at Cincinnati on Wednesday, which ended a miserable road trip. ''People are still going to say this was a bad season. But in my mind, if you help the team from this point forward, it doesn't matter what the numbers are.''</p>
        <p>There is still time for Ventura to help. The Mets (80-59), who will be host to the Philadelphia Phillies tonight, the beginning of a three-game series at Shea Stadium, led Arizona by five and one-half games in the National League wild-card race and trailed Atlanta by two and one-half games in the N.L. East after the Braves beat the Diamondbacks, 4-0, last night.</p>
        <p>Ventura will be in the middle of the lineup for the postseason push, as he has been all year, because the Mets need him. But it has been a season of slumps for Ventura, who batted .301 last year. He has 3 hits in his last 38 at-bats, and 8 in his last 58. He has 5 home runs and 19 runs batted in since the end of June.</p>
        <p>If the Mets reach the postseason and play deep into October, Ventura will have to help carry them. If teams pitch around catcher Mike Piazza, the cleanup hitter, as Ventura expects them to, they will have to give Ventura, the fifth hitter, good pitches to hit.</p>
        <p>''It's probably going to come down more to pitch selection and balance than anything,'' Ventura said. ''Because if other teams are going to automatically put a guy on base, they're also increasing their risk. So then it becomes more important to have balance and lay off bad pitches and just get a good pitch that you can hit and swing at it.</p>
        <p>''All you can do is try to make solid contact. There's little things you can do that help you with that, but for the most part, the reality of it is that teams aren't going to want to get beat by Mike.''</p>
        <p>Ventura; Tom Robson, the hitting coach; and Manager Bobby Valentine continue to search for what Ventura may be doing differently this season.</p>
        <p>''He has it,'' Valentine said Tuesday of Ventura's swing. ''He had it in batting practice today. Hitting is a mystery. When you're doing it, you don't know how you're doing it most of the time. You can be told a million times, but you have to do it.''</p>
        <p>Ventura says he has been healthy since he spent two weeks on the disabled list in July after jamming his shoulder while sliding. He has told Robson that his swing feels fine and that he is seeing the ball well. Nobody can pinpoint a problem.</p>
        <p>Ventura has tried subtle changes in his stance and in the way he holds his bat in an effort to maintain balance at the plate, to keep from drifting forward in the batter's box. ''There's no reason for me to stay in the same spot where I'm at right now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Until he finds something that helps him, Ventura said, he simply has to stay positive. Darryl Hamilton, a 12-year outfielder who has had his own frustrating season, said he has learned to cope by watching Ventura. And if there is one positive aspect to having a lost season on a good team, Hamilton said, it is that all can be forgotten with one pivotal hit in the pennant race or the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Ventura knows about big hits: his ''grand slam'' single in last year's N.L. Championship Series provided one of the most memorable moments in Mets history. But as a six-time Gold Glove winner, he can make his biggest contribution on defense.</p>
        <p>In the postseason, teams tend to play for one run more often, and errors facilitate that approach. Ventura has made 13 errors this year and is fifth in the league with a .960 fielding percentage, lower than last year's but about the same as his career mark.</p>
        <p>''When you get in the playoffs, the glove is sometimes more important than the bat,'' Hamilton said. ''I'm sure everybody here would sacrifice some hits for outstanding plays in the field, because in the playoffs, one run is gold. With a guy like Robin, even if he's struggling at the plate, you still want him in the field.''</p>
        <p>Ventura, who made three standout plays Tuesday as the Mets won their only game in six attempts this month, said he learned to separate offense from defense early in his career. When he came up with the Chicago White Sox, some of his best friends were pitchers. Through them, he realized just how much pitchers needed fielders.</p>
        <p>''You learn to separate it by living the life of a pitcher for a day, just mentally,'' Ventura said. ''I've been able to do that. If I was doing both poorly, obviously it would not be sitting very well. But I don't sit there and let one drag down the other.''</p>
        <p>First baseman Todd Zeile, Ventura's close friend, said he was sure Ventura was frustrated; like so many players, Zeile said, Ventura is a perfectionist. But 12 years in the majors have given Ventura the perspective to know how much he means to the team. That, Zeile said, ''keeps him on a higher plane'' despite his numbers and the scrutiny they get.</p>
        <p>''I still enjoy it,'' Ventura said. ''I could be frustrated and aggravated, all those things, but there are things that are positive: guys are having good years, the team's doing well, I enjoy the guys I play with immensely. Those are the things you find that are positives when you come to the ballpark and play.''</p>
