        <p>Editorial praises new Police Comr Bernard Kerik for transferring John Scanlon, chief of patrol who was in command during melee at Puerto Rican Day parade, when women were assaulted by mobs of drunken men in Central Park</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Many New Yorkers are still smoldering about the Police Department's failure to contain the mobs of drunken men who assaulted several women in Central Park just after the Puerto Rican National Day Parade in June. The outgoing police commissioner, Howard Safir, took an important step this summer when he disciplined more than a dozen officers, including six supervisors, for failing to deploy their officers properly during the event. But the incoming commissioner, Bernard Kerik, sent an even more powerful message this week when he transferred the officer who was in command during the parade, as part of a shake-up in the department  that displaced 30 senior managers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik's changes set an important tone at a time when the public needs reassurance that the Police Department will build on past successes in controlling crime while disciplining officers who fail to treat the public fairly or protect citizens from harm. His moves are consistent with the way he managed the New York City Department of Correction, where he served as a senior administrator for more than five years and as commissioner from 1997 until his appointment as police commissioner.</p>

        <p>Many New Yorkers are still smoldering about the Police Department's failure to contain the mobs of drunken men who assaulted several women in Central Park just after the Puerto Rican National Day Parade in June. The outgoing police commissioner, Howard Safir, took an important step this summer when he disciplined more than a dozen officers, including six supervisors, for failing to deploy their officers properly during the event. But the incoming commissioner, Bernard Kerik, sent an even more powerful message this week when he transferred the officer who was in command during the parade, as part of a shake-up in the department  that displaced 30 senior managers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik's changes set an important tone at a time when the public needs reassurance that the Police Department will build on past successes in controlling crime while disciplining officers who fail to treat the public fairly or protect citizens from harm. His moves are consistent with the way he managed the New York City Department of Correction, where he served as a senior administrator for more than five years and as commissioner from 1997 until his appointment as police commissioner.</p>
        <p>The jail system under Mr. Kerik developed an intensified version of the Police Department's Compstat program, in which officers and resources were shifted from one activity to another in reaction to carefully monitored crime statistics, which were viewed as early indicators of emerging trouble. Wardens and other officers were called to account and sometimes removed when they failed to respond to troubling statistics and trends in the jails.</p>
        <p>Crime statistics have been especially dismaying this year in the Bronx, which has experienced a dramatic rise in murders over the last year even as the number of murders in the city as a whole remained virtually the same. Mr. Kerik has now responded by replacing the department's top commander responsible for crime control there, Joanne Jaffe, the assistant chief in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>He has also replaced John Scanlon, the chief of patrol, who was in command during two of the department's most serious crowd control failures in recent years. Mr. Scanlon led officers policing the 1998 Million Youth March in Harlem, which nearly got out of hand when the police needlessly stormed the stage. He was also in charge during the melee at the Puerto Rican Day parade, when several women were assaulted while nearby police officers failed to respond to their pleas for help.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik's personnel changes seem correct on the merits and are symbolically important. Just two weeks after taking the helm and a day after being officially sworn in, the new commissioner has made it clear that managers in the Police Department will be held strictly accountable for the performance of their units.</p>
