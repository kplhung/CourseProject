        <p>Martina Hingis plopped down at a table in a restaurant outside Hilton Head, S.C., to lay a fork on some Southern cooking for the first time. But before the waiter could take her order, she noticed a palm-sized wooden triangle next to the salt and pepper. It was a pegboard stuffed with colorful golf tees, one stuck in every hole but one.</p>
        <p>In an instant, a game she'd never before seen became her obsession. Throughout the entire dinner, the uncommonly patient teenager from Switzerland eliminated tees by leaping one over the other, switching and plucking them, more fixated on decoding the inanimate opponent than making conversation.</p>
        <p>Long after the plates were cleared, Hingis finally slapped the triangle on the table with a satisfied smile. She'd done it. Just one tee remained.</p>
        <p>This was the spring of 1997, days after Hingis became the No. 1 ranked player in women's tennis. In the span of one dinner, she had unwittingly demonstrated her strategy for survival at the top. Whatever maneuver or manipulation it took, however long was necessary, she could devise a plan to be the last one standing, to be the last peg left.</p>
        <p>Although her body type wouldn't stand out in a crowd at the Gap, her muscle-bound savvy separates her from the rest of the tour. Mischievous by nature, if she's the host of a slumber party, it's best to stay awake.</p>
        <p>With those qualities, it is not surprising that Hingis, faced with the daunting power of the Williams sisters, would form an alliance with Lindsay Davenport in a maneuver that seems lifted from an episode of ''Survivor.'' It may seem petty on the outside, but Hingis understands that whether one is on a remote island or in a shark-infested office, there is one elementary school lesson of safety that never fails: the buddy system.</p>
        <p>''I saw Lindsay a while ago,'' Hingis said after she spent almost two hours developing her blueprint on a practice court yesterday at the National Tennis Center. ''I told her, 'One to go.' ''</p>
        <p>On Wednesday night, Davenport completed the first stage of the Plot. Inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, Davenport methodically pounded shot after shot at the shoestrings of Serena Williams's lilac Pumas, leaving her zip-quick opponent pinned behind the baseline and desperate to end draining rallies with trick shots.</p>
        <p>Somewhere, Hingis was flashing her Garfield smile.</p>
        <p>''I thought Lindsay played a great match,'' Hingis said. ''It was good for Lindsay to get by a player who had beaten her five times.''</p>
        <p>It was good for Hingis, too. Today, Hingis will try to dismantle Venus Williams's awesome force with the nerve and delicate touch of a bomb technician. If her strategy works -- if she can handcuff Williams by firing at her gangly body, if she can snap up balls on the rise and turn them into winners -- Hingis could face Davenport in the United States Open women's final. And if not her, then Davenport's semifinal opponent, Elena Dementieva.</p>
        <p>Either way, at least Hingis would avoid facing the mighty Williams sisters on consecutive days, and perhaps have a little more left to win a Grand Slam title for the first time since the 1999 Australian Open. To that end, it was to Hingis's advantage to motivate Davenport before her match against Serena Williams by saying these simple words, ''You're first.''</p>
        <p>Just a few courts away from Hingis, Richard Williams practiced yesterday with his daughter Venus. ''I think it's a good idea,'' he said of Hingis's strategy. ''If I'm chasing the damn rabbit, I'd ask the dog to help, too.''</p>
        <p>But that's part of the issue beneath the surface here. The Williams sisters aren't ahead of the higher ranked Hingis and Davenport, it just seems that way. Colorful, charismatic and creative in their style, they are the focus of every camera, at the heart of all the buzz.</p>
        <p>Davenport is too polite in public to openly admit she's hyped out on the Williams sisters, but the more candid Hingis sees the sensation as a personal affront.</p>
        <p>''I really think the Williams sisters are good for women's tennis because they bring a lot of people out to see the sport,'' Hingis said. ''But I'm still the No. 1 player and Lindsay is No. 2. Venus has only played half the year, and Serena missed several weeks, too. They're injured a lot, and don't play as many events. For years, they've done a lot of talking about how they're going to be No. 1 and No. 2. They aren't, and it gets -- I don't know -- tiring.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say they are big talkers. That's not what I mean. But it's been five or six years of this, and they haven't done it yet.''</p>
        <p>What they have done is rattle Hingis, if only momentarily. And that, too, is good for tennis. The Williams sisters have sent Hingis back to the drawing board. And in her own crafty way, Hingis has motivated Davenport to regroup with her. Just like Serena and Venus, Lindsay and Martina have the ability to push each other.</p>
        <p>Now the real competition is on. Which alliance will have to adjust next? Hingis and Davenport or Williams and Williams?</p>
        <p>''No, we're not going to change,'' Richard Williams said. ''We changed tennis to the extent that everyone is playing to a higher level.''</p>
        <p>The clever Hingis has a plan to match it. But she needs Davenport by her side. After all, there is safety in numbers. At least until Hingis and Davenport have to meet each other in a final. If that happens on Saturday, on the island of center court, the alliance will end. Last peg left wins.</p>
