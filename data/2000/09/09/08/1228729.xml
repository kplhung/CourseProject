        <p>Is there any relationship so intimate as that between a puppet and its master? Whether controlled by hand, strings or sticks, puppets are famous for providing bolder alter egos for those who manipulate them. ''My Puppet, Myself'' could easily be a subtitle for everything from the cheery television shows of Shari Lewis to those homicidal ventriloquist movies that show up every decade or so.</p>
        <p>As portraits of divided selves, however, these are all quite mild compared with the spectacle presented toward the end of Ronnie Burkett's ''Street of Blood,'' the ambitious, exhaustingly told tale of anger and intolerance in rural Canada, now at the New York Theater Workshop.</p>

        <p>Is there any relationship so intimate as that between a puppet and its master? Whether controlled by hand, strings or sticks, puppets are famous for providing bolder alter egos for those who manipulate them. ''My Puppet, Myself'' could easily be a subtitle for everything from the cheery television shows of Shari Lewis to those homicidal ventriloquist movies that show up every decade or so.</p>
        <p>As portraits of divided selves, however, these are all quite mild compared with the spectacle presented toward the end of Ronnie Burkett's ''Street of Blood,'' the ambitious, exhaustingly told tale of anger and intolerance in rural Canada, now at the New York Theater Workshop.</p>
        <p>In that scene, Mr. Burkett, the puppeteer, is Jesus Christ; the marionette at the end of the strings he is pulling is a movie star who suggests a cross between Katharine Hepburn and the demented Norma Desmond. She is also a vampire, and she craves a taste of Jesus' blood. ''Let me know your pain,'' says the gnarled, spangled creature, less than half Mr. Burkett's size, as she hungrily crawls up his chest.</p>
        <p>Before you cry ''Sacrilege!'' on the one hand or ''Far out!'' on the other, you should know that ''Street of Blood,'' part of the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater, has a heart as pious and platitudinous as that of its narrator, an apple-cheeked, gray-haired farmer's wife who describes herself as ''a silly old biddy in a Sears housedress.''</p>
        <p>That one-person encounter between Jesus and the Hollywood Antichrist is bizarre enough to make you sit up in your seat for a moment and consider just what makes Mr. Burkett tick. But the odds are also that during the more than two hours leading up to that scene, you have found yourself slumping toward the floor more than once.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burkett is a obviously a man of high-reaching ideas, many talents and amazing stamina; his touring Theater of Marionettes, based in Alberta, has previously considered subjects like the Holocaust. He has created all the puppets in this 14-character play, as well as their many elaborate costumes and the show's set, and he pulls the strings and provides the voices for every one of them, visibly assisted by only his stage manager, Terri Gillis.</p>
        <p>What's more, he has written a script that addresses the theological implications of AIDS, the destructiveness of the gay anger bred by homophobia and the dangers of identifying with the heroines of old movies. Unfortunately, this is all presented with a patient, smiling preachiness, an attitude one associates with aspiringly groovy ministers hoping to recruit young congregation members. The marionettes wind up seeming like little more than a lure, the candy coating on the pill.</p>
        <p>The show is centered on the relationship between the gentle, good Edna Rural and Eden, her defiantly gay son, who grew up idolizing one Esme Massengill, star of stage, screen and bloodsucking. Both Esme and Jesus show up for a showdown in the little town of Turnip Corners, battling for the souls of the conflicted Rurals. Though Edna has a few reprimands for Jesus for neglecting his flock, it's not hard to predict who will win.</p>
        <p>Substitute drag queens for puppets and take away the Christian angle, and ''Street of Blood'' starts to look awfully familiar, like Charles Busch's ''Vampire Lesbians of Sodom'' stripped of its wicked irony. Mercifully, there are the puppets, and if you focus on them instead of what they're saying, ''Street of Blood'' is easier to take.</p>
        <p>It's not just the finely detailed appearances of the marionettes that astonishes; it is also Mr. Burkett's ability to endow them with such physical eloquence. A seemingly simple twitch of the strings, and these characters deliver gestures and assume postures more expressively human than much of what's offered by live actors in Broadway musicals these days.</p>
        <p>The overture for ''Street of Blood'' is ostensibly provided by a sextet called the Turnip Corners Ladies Orchestrale. How each of these musicians simulates playing her instrument, from piano to clarinet, is a wonder. Even more so is how each commands the stage with her own character-defining walk. Mr. Burkett's marionettes are clearly talented performers. Now if only they could find the right script.</p>
        <p>STREET OF BLOOD</p>
        <p>Created and performed by Ronnie Burkett; music and sound by Cathy Nosaty; lighting by Bill Williams; marionette, sets and costumes by Mr. Burkett; production stage manager, Terri Gillis. The Rink-A-Dink Inc. production of Ronnie Burkett Theater of Marionettes. Part of the Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater. At the New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, Lower East Side.</p>
