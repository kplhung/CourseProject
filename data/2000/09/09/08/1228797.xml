        <p>Supporters of a bill to repeal the federal tax on large estates failed today to overturn President Clinton's veto of the measure, killing the issue for the year in legislative terms but leaving it very much alive politically.</p>
        <p>Republicans said they were eager to take the debate to the campaign trail, where they said a repeal would attract support from small-business owners, farmers, entrepreneurs and other voters who object to having part of their wealth taxed when they pass it to their heirs.</p>
        <p>Democrats, the majority of whom lined up with Mr. Clinton in opposition to the bill, said they would continue to make their case that while the estate tax should be reduced for family-owned farms and businesses, the measure that failed today would eat up too much of the projected budget surplus and disproportionately reward a tiny percentage of the richest families.</p>
        <p>The bill passed the House and the Senate earlier this year, with the support of nearly all Republicans and some Democrats. Mr. Clinton vetoed it last week.</p>
        <p>Overriding the veto would have required a two-thirds vote in both chambers, and in the House today supporters of the bill fell well short.</p>
        <p>The vote was 274 votes in favor of overturning the veto and 157 in favor of sustaining it. It would have taken 290 votes to overturn the veto if all 435 House members had voted, or 288 of the 431 votes cast today.</p>
        <p>When the House passed the bill in June by a vote of 279 to 136, 65 Democrats voted in favor. Today, despite pressure from party leaders and phone calls to some of those 65 from Mr. Clinton, 53 Democrats still bucked their party to support an override.</p>
        <p>In a statement after the vote, Mr. Clinton commended those representatives who had voted to uphold the veto and kept up his attack on the bill and the overall Republican effort to push through a series of tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''This is a misguided bill that provides a huge tax cut to the most well-off Americans at the expense of working families,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''It is a key ingredient of a Republican tax plan that would leave nothing for Social Security, Medicare, education or a voluntary, affordable prescription drug benefit.''</p>
        <p>Next week the Republican leadership in Congress is expected to try to override the president's veto of its other main tax bill this year, a tax cut for married couples. Republicans acknowledged that they would probably fail, but said that again highlighting Mr. Clinton's opposition to tax cuts would help them retain control of the House and help put Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the White House.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore opposed the estate tax bill passed by Congress, but has supported a smaller plan to reduce the tax on family-owned farms and businesses. Mr. Bush, who included repeal of the estate tax in his $1.3 trillion tax cut proposal, said in a statement today that if he is elected president, ''there will be no veto to override'' because he will ''sign the abolition of the death tax into law.''</p>
        <p>The legislation would have phased out the federal estate and gift tax over the next 10 years, with much of the tax disappearing only at the end of that period.</p>
        <p>Under current law, the tax is levied only on estates valued at $675,000 or more, an amount already scheduled to rise to $1 million by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms have a special exemption up to $1.3 million. Above those levels, estates are subject to a graduated tax with a top rate of 55 percent.</p>
        <p>Because of the exemptions, the tax actually effects relatively few estates -- fewer than 48,000 this year. But it concerns groups with considerable political leverage, including the small-business and farm lobbies, as well as the wealthy.</p>
        <p>Democrats renewed their call today for a compromise measure they offered earlier. The Democratic alternative would immediately raise the exemption for family-owned farms and businesses to $2 million per person, or $4 million per couple.</p>
        <p>But Republicans again rebuffed the Democratic plan, saying that it was built around tax rules that are complicated and narrowly drawn, and that it would benefit only a tiny percentage of people.</p>
        <p>''There is only one way to rid the code of this immoral, unfair and economically unsound tax, and that's to eliminate it,'' said Representative Jennifer Dunn, Republican of Washington.</p>
        <p>Democrats said that Congress should be concentrating on issues that are of concern to all voters, not just to the 2 percent who have to worry about estate taxes.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, said his constituents never mentioned the estate tax when talking to him about their concerns. Instead, he said, they press him for action on adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, and on education, shoring up Social Security and keeping guns out of schools.</p>
        <p>''People do not want to spend the majority of this surplus on tax cuts, and they sure don't want to spend it on tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans,'' Mr. Gephardt said.</p>
