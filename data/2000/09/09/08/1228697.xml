        <p>As soon as nature began to shrink under ingenious human efforts to dominate it, imagination magnified the charms of untouched land. In the mid-19th century, Hawthorne in the Massachusetts woods and Thoreau at Walden Pond were made uneasy by the intrusive sound of locomotives and the French painter Theodore Rousseau, in the Barbizon forest, said: ''Let the civilized world go to the devil! Long live nature, forests and ancient poetry!''</p>
        <p>The civilized world, advancing on steel tracks, was considered the sworn enemy of pastoral peace. It still is. The prescribed antidote to urban complexity is simple, unspoiled nature. Only there doesn't seem to be any.</p>
        <p>America had some for a while, and photographers like Timothy O'Sullivan and W. H. Jackson, who accompanied exploratory expeditions in the third quarter of the 19th century, depicted it while the West was being won. Today a lot of that territory is laced with macadam and people in cars crisscross it in search of untouched landscape. But landscape has lost credibility even as a word. Like nature it is an idea, a set of cultural postulates, something constructed, rather than a thing in itself.  Consider ''landscape architects.''  Consider ''urban landscapes.''</p>
        <p>''Expanding Horizons: Landscape Photographs From the Whitney Museum of American Art,'' at the Whitney's branch at Phillip Morris, begins and just about ends with this premise. In this small and pleasant show -- a mere 15 photographs, though some are very big -- either the museum or the photographers define landscape loosely. Most of the pictures speak of human intervention in nature or in the depiction of it. Both the land and its images have obviously been organized and reorganized: watch out, landscape; here we come.</p>
        <p>This approach is entirely in keeping with current ideas about the spoliation of the land and of reality in general. The land is being ruined, and reality, never solid to begin with, is in shambles under the onslaught of philosophy and digitization, so photographers are being up to date when they meddle with what's left.</p>
        <p>The one photographer at the Whitney who has the somewhat old-fashioned view that something like pure nature still exists is Sally Gall. Her images tend to be silent, somber, rich depictions of a swamp, betraying no evidence that humans ever had troubled the territory. These photographs are about light and water and the games they play on the eye as much as they are about landscape; in one, the sunlight shining behind dark tree trunks advances between them in flat, straight planes like pathways of light across the water.</p>
        <p>Sally Mann's image of a southern forest is also wholly free of people or their interventions -- just a few leafy branches, some hanging moss and a blurred tree trunk. Yet Ms. Mann herself has intervened, not in the land but in the photograph, which is bleached to an indistinct realm of light in the background, thrown out of focus, spotted with imperfections in the darkroom: more a photographer's vision of the forest than an account of how the woods look.</p>
        <p>The rest of the exhibition consists of landscapes that human beings have altered in one way or another. They may be remote like Gabriel Orozco's photograph of a parachute open like a white plastic sunflower on the brown earth of Iceland or close at hand, like Bruce Davidson's handsome panorama of the Bow Bridge in Central Park, where a twin-towered building on Central Park West rises above that picturesque patch of tame countryside laid out for people who live in concrete boxes.</p>
        <p>In 1922 Edward Weston wrote that landscape was too ''chaotic'' and ''too crude and lacking in arrangement'' to be a good subject for photographers, and the handful of photographers at the Whitney almost seem to agree. The human touch makes the land more -- how shall I say? -- human, more arranged, with all the virtues and vices of engineering of one kind or another, so landscape today seldom escapes or outclasses the human presence. People have found the land so useful, or made it so useful for themselves, that it must now be contemplated at a different level, as tools and objects must be regarded differently from  raw materials.</p>
        <p>Richard Misrach's sea-and-sky scapes concentrate on the Golden Gate Bridge, that lovely example of 20th-century technology, at various times of day, in varying light. With titles like ''2.21.98 4:46 P.M.,'' and a fixed vantage point, Mr. Misrach follows changes only in the sky, the water and the colors, from lowery clouds that reach down to smother the rocks to blank slates of sky, from gunmetal and silver to pale wheat-colored and gray. These are not so much landscapes as chronologies, weather reports, light meters, spectra, records of the interplay between the sun's progress and the air.</p>
        <p>Some technological feats and their results receive less credit for improving the landscape than elegant bridges do. Emmet Gowin took an aerial photograph of an aeration pond at a toxic water-treatment facility that has a peculiar and slightly sinister sense of order. Ranks of bloblike, irregular circles with dark sunburst centers, surrounded by lighter aureoles, look like a surrealist's vision of an array of flattened breasts.</p>
        <p>Some landscapes are entirely human concoctions. Hiroshi Sugimoto photographed a diorama of the Ordovician Period at the American Museum of Natural History, an underwater seascape populated by odd creatures that might be the products of a cartoonist's mind. The photograph is a scrupulous record of a constructed scene that no human eyes could ever have seen in the original: the document of an actual object made to inform us about an educated guess.</p>
        <p>Geoffrey Crewdson concocts a lower-class suburban setting where  congeries of birds keep vigil over a circle of half-buried eggs: nature reasserting its mythic powers among the petite bourgeoisie. And Vik Muniz makes a little table-top model of Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty, that grand artistic alteration of a landscape, and photographs it so one might almost believe it was the jetty itself.</p>
        <p>''Expanding Horizons'' is an apt accompaniment to the ''Pastoral Pop'' show in the larger part of the Whitney lobby in which sculptors take the idea of landscape to absurd and mildly amusing extremes. Why not? Some more ambitious landscapes, some plazas and topiary gardens, lawns and golf courses do, too. At any rate constructed landscapes are all around us.</p>
        <p>The Whitney at Phillip Morris actually has one on permanent view. In the two cafe spaces in the lobby, trees in full leaf spring from grates in the stone floor. They're fake, but they look as real as the trees visible on the sidewalk outside the window. But then you never know. Maybe those are fake as well.</p>
        <p>''Expanding Horizons: Landscape Photographs From the Whitney Museum of American Art'' is at the Whitney's branch at Phillip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through Oct. 6.</p>
