        <p>Internal documents from Bridgestone/Firestone show that officials of the company were briefed as early as February about rising warranty costs for the tires that the company recalled last month.</p>
        <p>Documents obtained by investigators working for Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is the chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, show that members of Firestone's sales staff were aware of increasing warranty claims for the company's light truck tires even as Firestone, the American unit of Bridgestone of Japan, told the Ford Motor Company and regulators that the tires did not have problems. The documents were distributed to members of the subcommittee in preparation for its hearing Wednesday, but were not discussed at the hearing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin said that Firestone's safety officials should have been concerned about the warranty information. ''You can't have that much information floating around not to have noticed a problem that should have been notified to federal authorities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>John Lampe, Firestone's executive vice president for sales, said in a telephone interview tonight that the tire maker had not perceived the rising claims as a problem because the number of Firestone tires in use had been increasing as the company gained market share. For this reason, he said, ''I'm not aware of any discussion that took place about the number of'' warranty claims.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lampe said that warranty claims, known as adjustments in the tire industry, had not risen in comparison with the number of tires in use.</p>
        <p>The Congressional investigators' documents include charts prepared for the sales staff's annual meeting in February that repeatedly and prominently mention the high cost of warranty claims for tread separation in light truck tires, but do not calculate a cost per tire in use.</p>
        <p>The label on one chart read ''Separations increasing'' in large underlined letters. The chart showed that the number of warranty ''adjustments,'' or claims, for tread separation had climbed to 4,694 in 1999 from 4,200 in 1998, an increase of 11.8 percent. The chart also described how the tires were coming apart and the rates at which each type of separation was increasing. Firestone's market share grew  by eight-tenths of a percentage point in 1999 from 1998, according to Tire Business magazine, while the overall market for tires grew by 4.7 percent in terms of sales. The actual number of tires sold is an industry secret.</p>
        <p>Five more charts analyzed patterns in tread separations and emphasized tires for light trucks, a category that includes the Ford Explorer. One of those charts, labeled ''separations,'' showed that the number of separations involving Wilderness tires, on sale since 1996, had risen 194 percent in 1999 from the level a year earlier.</p>
        <p>A separate collection of charts, prepared for the same sales meeting in February and labeled ''Critical Performance Issues,'' also singled out light truck recreational tires of the sort installed on Explorers, with one chart stating in large letters: ''Wilderness AT needs improvement.''</p>
        <p>Firestone recalled 6.5 million ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires on Aug. 9 after Ford analyzed the tire maker's data on crash claims and found a pattern of property damage and injury claims dating back at least to 1997. Firestone officials said then and have said repeatedly since then that they missed the trend of crash claims because they were focusing on warranty data that did not show a problem.</p>
        <p>Gary Crigger, Firestone's executive vice president for business planning, testified before a Senate subcommittee on Wednesday that the company's safety program relied on warranty data, quality tests at factories and field research into the performance of tires in use. ''None of those indicators pointed to any kind of a problem with the tire line that we are talking about here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Mr. Tauzin's subcommittee, said this evening that investigators would look next at how Firestone and Ford went about testing the tires a decade ago, before the Explorer was introduced in late 1990 as a 1991 model. Mr. Tauzin accused Ford in an interview earlier this week of not having tested the tires at 26 pounds per square inch, the pressure at which Ford recommends that they be inflated. Firestone began recommending at the time of the recall that the tires be inflated to 30 pounds per square inch, which would increase their capacity to carry weight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin told Firestone's Mr. Wyant at the hearing on Wednesday night that the subcommittee had been trying unsuccessfully for a week to obtain from the tire maker the original test data for the tires. Mr. Wyant said that Firestone had been engaged in an ''around-the-clock search'' for the test results and that he did not know what had become of the information.</p>
        <p>A growing number of lawmakers have been calling for a criminal investigation of Firestone and Ford. Attorney General Janet Reno said this morning that she was reviewing such a request from Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont. But Justice Department officials said that an investigation was not likely because the federal law covering auto defects is fairly weak.</p>
        <p>The law provides for fines of no more than $925,000 on manufacturers and does not authorize criminal penalties. Firestone and Ford, and possibly their executives, could still face prosecution by state or local authorities, however, if it is proved that they knowingly sold products with deadly defects.</p>
