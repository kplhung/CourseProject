        <p>Turning the nationwide shortage of school principals into a campaign issue, Hillary Rodham Clinton proposed a plan yesterday to help schools recruit and train 10,000 principals over the next five years.</p>
        <p>In a speech at Queens College, Mrs. Clinton said the federal government should award a total of $60 million a year to school districts that sorely need principals and assistant principals. Schools could use the money, which would come in the form of matching grants, to hire outstanding teachers or people from other professions as principals.</p>
        <p>School districts could also use the grants to provide stipends to ''master principals,'' who would train and provide support to new principals, ideally with the help of nonprofit groups and universities, Mrs. Clinton said. Her proposal comes as an increasing number of schools in New York City and across the nation are struggling to replace principals who have retired or quit in the face of mounting job pressures.</p>
        <p>''No school can reach its potential without a firm leader,'' Mrs. Clinton said, addressing several hundred students and community members. ''If we don't put an emphasis at the national level on recruiting and training and placing more principals we are going to fall further and further behind in the leadership gap.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also said that school districts should be required to provide parents with statistics about violent incidents and discipline problems in their children's schools. The information, which would be posted on the Internet as part of a school's annual report card, would include the number of students who were caught with weapons and the number of violent incidents against teachers.</p>
        <p>She also introduced a plan to break some of the nation's largest high schools into smaller schools, an idea that has already taken off in many urban school districts, especially in New York City. The proposal, which would cost $100 million a year in federal funds, would focus primarily on high schools with several thousand students.</p>
        <p>The new, smaller schools would remain in the same building and use the same teachers, but most would need to hire new administrators and support staff. School districts would receive matching grants to cover hiring costs, Mrs. Clinton's aides said. Proponents of small high schools say they have fewer discipline problems and higher graduation rates than large schools, which they say breed violence and academic failure.</p>
        <p>In New York City, hundreds of small public schools have been created over the last decade, many in buildings that once housed enormous high schools. The schools often have a theme, like science or the arts. Some are at the top of city achievement lists, although others -- typically those that have been set up to serve children who failed in traditional settings -- rank at the bottom.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides said money for the principal recruitment program and the small schools program would come out of the federal budget surplus.</p>
        <p>''I want to do for children today what my parents and their generation did for me and my classmates,'' she said. ''That means we take this surplus, this moment of great prosperity, and we do the responsible things with it. We don't give trillion-dollar tax cuts, most of which go to people who are already doing well.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also reiterated many of her other education proposals, some of which address the nationwide teacher shortage with promises of scholarships and signing bonuses to people who agree to teach in hard-to-staff schools. Her campaign also released a television commercial yesterday that highlights her education proposals and paints her as a longtime crusader for public schools.</p>
        <p>Her Republican opponent, Congressman Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, released a statement saying that Mrs. Clinton's efforts to improve education in Arkansas when her husband was that state's governor were ''a dismal failure whereby taxpayers spent more money and got worse results.''</p>
        <p>As Mrs. Clinton ended her speech at Queens College, two audience members stood and shouted, ''Hillary hates Israel!'' and ''Jew hater!'' But they were practically drowned out by applause for Mrs. Clinton, and they quietly left the room. In a question-and-answer session that followed, Mrs. Clinton, who has had difficulty swaying Jewish voters, outlined her views on the Middle East and said that ''a Palestinian state would make sense.''</p>
        <p>But she added that she was ''absolutely opposed to any unilateral declaration of statehood'' by the Palestinians.</p>
