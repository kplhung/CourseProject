        <p>One night last spring, fighting insomnia in a North Carolina hotel room, I spent a few hours flipping back and forth between ''The Matrix'' and ''Devil's Advocate,'' which were showing on competing cable stations. After a while they began to run together into a single montage of Keanu Reeves dressed in black clothes, furrowing his smooth brow in bewilderment as he grappled with one metaphysical conundrum after another.</p>
        <p>In ''The Watcher,'' a damp, morose bit of gristle directed by Joe Charbanic, Mr. Reeves, once again dressed in black, looks jowly and fatigued, perhaps because this time out the role of metaphysical conundrum has been assigned to him. Playing a sicko whose metier is the strangulation of young women, Mr. Reeves conveys his villainy by enunciating every syllable with exquisite care and inflecting his utterances with the fastidious sarcasm of a surfer James Mason. Unfortunately, bewilderment comes more naturally to him than diabolical intelligence, and his line readings, aiming for a mixture of suavity and creepiness, just sound silly.</p>

        <p>One night last spring, fighting insomnia in a North Carolina hotel room, I spent a few hours flipping back and forth between ''The Matrix'' and ''Devil's Advocate,'' which were showing on competing cable stations. After a while they began to run together into a single montage of Keanu Reeves dressed in black clothes, furrowing his smooth brow in bewilderment as he grappled with one metaphysical conundrum after another.</p>
        <p>In ''The Watcher,'' a damp, morose bit of gristle directed by Joe Charbanic, Mr. Reeves, once again dressed in black, looks jowly and fatigued, perhaps because this time out the role of metaphysical conundrum has been assigned to him. Playing a sicko whose metier is the strangulation of young women, Mr. Reeves conveys his villainy by enunciating every syllable with exquisite care and inflecting his utterances with the fastidious sarcasm of a surfer James Mason. Unfortunately, bewilderment comes more naturally to him than diabolical intelligence, and his line readings, aiming for a mixture of suavity and creepiness, just sound silly.</p>
        <p>Of course, not even Sir Anthony Hopkins himself could do much with the lines Mr. Reeves is required to deliver: ''We need each other, we define each other, we're yin and yang,'' he declares at a climactic moment, adapting Tom Cruise's tearful speech from ''Jerry Maguire'' to a darker purpose. The role of yin -- an F.B.I. agent named Jack Campbell -- is played by James Spader. As any moviegoer knows, homicidal maniacs and the law enforcement officers who pursue them are joined together by deep and mysterious psychic bonds. ''The Watcher'' pushes this convention to an extreme by making Jack's torment the killer's explicit motive.</p>
        <p>And Jack is plenty tormented. This we know because he staggers home to a messy apartment, stares into his empty refrigerator and takes a lot of pills. He also sees a therapist (Marisa Tomei), who keeps a copy of Psychology Today on her office coffee table. ''Maybe you're just afraid,'' she speculates, after Jack haltingly tries to explain how being stalked by a murderous lunatic makes him feel.</p>
        <p>''I am afraid,'' he replies.</p>
        <p>''Let's talk about that,'' the good doctor suggests.</p>
        <p>Let's not. Like ''The Cell,'' the season's other serial-killer picture, ''The Watcher'' is the feature-directing debut of a filmmaker whose previous work consists mostly of music videos and it is similarly crammed with MTV-style visual effects. The murderer's point of view is registered in grainy hand-held video, and Jack's inner turmoil reaches us through smeary, cut-up flashbacks. The soundtrack swells with spooky techno effects, angel choirs and echoey bits of remembered dialogue.</p>
        <p>All of this moody posturing is evidence of the film's aspiration to be taken as what its production notes solemnly call -- daring to invoke the name of Hitchcock -- a ''psychological thriller.'' But it's about as thrilling as it is psychologically insightful. There are some big explosions and a straight-to-video car chase, at the end of which Jack and the entire Chicago police force seem to give up, as though the film had kept rolling after the director shouted ''Cut!'' This is one of those movies in which the forces of law and order are at once omnipotent -- commanding extraordinary resources of technology and manpower, all of which can be summoned by snapping open a cell phone -- and utterly incompetent.</p>
        <p>''It's not as easy as you think,'' Jack muses about his job, but watching him let the killer slip through his fingers again and again, you wonder how hard it could be.</p>
        <p>Early in the movie Jack crashes through his apartment, grabs a hypodermic needle and jabs it into a big purple bruise just below his bellybutton. ''I'm self-injecting migraine medication,'' he tells his worried shrink. By the end of ''The Watcher'' you'll need your own prescription.</p>
        <p>''The Watcher'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes several brutal killings and a lot of tense F.B.I.-agent-under-pressure swearing.</p>
