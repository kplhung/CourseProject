        <p>After a long, somnolent summer, Broadway came alive again this week. Just hours after Labor Day turned into that terrible Tuesday, rehearsals began for ''The Full Monty,'' the musical version of the hit 1997 movie and a show promising more male nudity than any Broadway production since ''Love! Valour! Compassion!''</p>
        <p>Tuesday also brought the first preview of ''The Best Man,'' Gore Vidal's 1960 political satire. At a dress rehearsal, Mr. Vidal took to the stage to trumpet the quality of this revival. ''I haven't changed a word,'' he said proudly. Whether that was wise remains to be seen.</p>

        <p>After a long, somnolent summer, Broadway came alive again this week. Just hours after Labor Day turned into that terrible Tuesday, rehearsals began for ''The Full Monty,'' the musical version of the hit 1997 movie and a show promising more male nudity than any Broadway production since ''Love! Valour! Compassion!''</p>
        <p>Tuesday also brought the first preview of ''The Best Man,'' Gore Vidal's 1960 political satire. At a dress rehearsal, Mr. Vidal took to the stage to trumpet the quality of this revival. ''I haven't changed a word,'' he said proudly. Whether that was wise remains to be seen.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday two more fall entries began their out-of-town tryouts: ''The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe'' in Seattle and ''Seussical'' in Boston. (More on this later.) Farther afield a pair of productions from the same household but on opposite sides of the globe may also gather some serious attention from New York producers.</p>
        <p>The first is ''The Late Henry Moss,'' Sam Shepard's new play, which opens with an all-star cast (Nick Nolte, Cheech Marin, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson) at the Magic Theater in San Francisco on Nov. 14. Less certain but equally intriguing is the possibility that Jessica Lange, who lives with Mr. Shepard, may take on Mary Tyrone, the ephemeral mother of despair in Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' in a November production in London. Nothing is confirmed, but if it comes together, expect some jet-lagged audience members at that premiere.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, however, the big action is closer to home, where a mix of the musical, the comical and the lyrical promise an interesting Broadway season. At very least it won't put anyone to sleep.</p>
        <p>The Musicals</p>
        <p>The musical carrying the heaviest burden of expectation is the season's most lighthearted. On Nov. 9 ''Seussical'' opens at the Richard Rodgers Theater, having run the gamut of gossip, from reports of early ecstasy to more recent signals of concern.</p>
        <p>The costume designer was dismissed recently, and if the critics in Boston can be trusted, the show still needs work. Writing yesterday in The Boston Globe, Ed Siegel said the show was overearnest and clunky, faulting its ''middle-of-the-road literal-mindedness.'' That said, he also predicted success on Broadway, thanks to a catchy score.</p>
        <p>With the questions hanging over ''Seussical,'' ''The Full Monty'' has emerged as a contender for the title of Big Musical. The show finished a sold-out run at the Old Globe in San Diego in July and, on the strength of supportive reviews, booked the Eugene O'Neill. The show's advance buzz and advance sales have been strong. It also has the jump on the competition; with an Oct. 26 opening it is the first musical offering of the season.</p>
        <p>The final new musical of the fall is ''Jane Eyre,'' which bounced around the regional circuit for several years before a successful run at La Jolla Playhouse in California over the summer. In November it lands at the Brooks Atkinson.</p>
        <p>For all the talk of dominance of revivals, the fall's only return engagement is ''The Rocky Horror Show,'' and one would be hard pressed to categorize this 1975 camp favorite as standard Broadway fare. (For those who missed the long-running midnight movie, here's a synopsis: A couple gets lost and finds a haunted castle. Freaks emerge.) The show, which opens on Nov. 14 at Circle in the Square, has already won the award for the most eclectic cast, luring a rocker (Joan Jett), a talker (Dick Cavett) and a mocker (Lea DeLaria) into Frankenfurter Castle.</p>
        <p>The Plays</p>
        <p>Of the 10 new Broadway productions planned for the fall, 6 are plays. ''The Best Man'' will be the first, opening on Sept. 17.</p>
        <p>October will bring something of a modern rarity: two new plays in a single week. The first is ''The Dinner Party'' from Neil Simon, his first new comedy on Broadway since ''Proposals'' in 1997. It opens on Oct. 19 at the Music Box.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 24 ''Proof,'' David Auburn's mathematically tinged drama about a father and daughter, opens at the Walter Kerr. It is one of two transfers from the Manhattan Theater Club; the second, the comedy ''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,'' opens on Nov. 2 at the Barrymore. Its advance stands at about $1.6 million.</p>
        <p>Besides ''The Best Man,'' and ''Search for Signs,'' starring Lily Tomlin, the other revival of the fall is the Roundabout Theater's ''Betrayal,'' Harold Pinter's time-bending dissection of infidelity. The cast was set this week: Juliette Binoche, Liev Shrieber and John Slattery. The director is David Leveaux, whose stewardship of another adultery-laden classic, ''The Real Thing,'' was a high point last season.</p>
        <p>As usual, Off Broadway offers far more new drama. One proven Broadway talent, the French playwright Yazmina Reza (''Art''), opens her newest work, ''The Unexpected Man,'' at a big small house, the 399-seat Promenade, on Oct. 24. Eileen Atkins and Alan Bates star as strangers on a train.</p>
        <p>Some A-list American writers also have new work in store, including Wendy Wasserstein (''Old Money,'' at Lincoln Center), Craig Lucas (''Stranger,'' at the Vineyard), Susan Sontag (''Alice in Bed,'' at the New York Theater Workshop) and Horton Foote (''The Last of the Thorntons,'' at the Signature Theater). And let's not forget Isaac Mizrahi, the fashion designer cum showman, who brings his one-man show, ''Les Mizrahi,'' to the Drama Dept. in October. Mr. Mizrahi promises to sing, dance and, yes, sew every night.</p>
        <p>For clowning, however, it is tough to compete with the master vaudevillian Bill Irwin, who will return to familiar territory with Samuel Beckett's ''Texts for Nothing,'' opening in October at the Classic Stage Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Irwin, known for his near-silent clowning with David Shiner (the Cat in the Hat in ''Seussical''), performed an adaptation of ''Texts,'' directed by Joseph Chaikin, to critical acclaim in 1992. This time Mr. Irwin is directing himself and doing just 4 of the 13 short monologues in ''Texts.'' The process sounded appropriately Beckettian.</p>
        <p>''The stage manager and I are in here alone every day,'' Mr. Irwin said. ''It's different. And every day I work on it, it gets more different.''</p>
        <p>He added with a laugh, ''We shall see.''</p>
