        <p>In a case that has pitted medical privacy against the demands of legal disclosure, two more psychiatrists reluctantly testified yesterday that they warned a wife of potential danger after briefly treating her angry husband, a plastic surgeon who is now accused of killing her.</p>
        <p>The wife, Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, vanished 15 years ago, and her husband, Dr. Robert Bierenbaum, a plastic surgeon, will stand trial on a murder charge this fall in Manhattan Criminal Court. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
        <p>During the pretrial hearings yesterday, the psychiatrists acknowledged that they had feared for Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum's safety after initial consultations with her husband and that, as a widely established psychiatric practice that is legally binding in many states, they had warned her of the potential danger.</p>
        <p>But they also acknowledged discomfort at being compelled to testify, given their obligation to safeguard Dr. Bierenbaum's privacy and keep his admissions confidential, an obligation that one of the doctors called lifelong, despite the brevity of treatment.</p>
        <p>With little precedent to guide her,  Judge Leslie Crocker Snyder must decide whether the psychiatrists' testimony can be presented to a jury as evidence against Dr. Bierenbaum or whether any information regarding his medical treatment must remain confidential.</p>
        <p>In medical and legal circles, the decision facing the judge is not a small one. Prosecutors have argued that once the doctors warned Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum and the defendants' parents -- with Dr. Bierenbaum's permission, they contend --  the doctors effectively opened the door and waived their confidentiality.</p>
        <p>But many psychiatrists believe that a decision to admit the testimony could have a chilling effect on the doctor-patient relationship, which depends on trust and the assurance that all admissions remain secret.</p>
        <p>To that end, the New York State Psychiatric Association and the American Psychoanalytic Association recently filed a brief in the case, opposing the prosecutors' efforts to disclose Dr. Bierenbaum's confidential medical information. They contend that doctors' warnings to third parties do not erase a patient's right to privacy.</p>
        <p>Judge Crocker Snyder's decision could have important implications for the outcome of the trial. Three psychiatrists have now testified that after brief consultations, they deemed Dr. Bierenbaum to be dangerous.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael H. Stone, a psychiatrist who testified last month, also wrote a letter to Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum, warning her that her life might be in danger if she remained with her husband.</p>
        <p>And for prosecutors, the psychiatrists' warnings could be crucial in establishing Dr. Bierenbaum's guilt,  especially because Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum's body has not been found. Since her disappearance, Dr. Bierenbaum has remarried and now lives in North Dakota.</p>
        <p>Gerald Shargel, a Manhattan defense lawyer, said: ''There is no question that this evidence would have a devastating impact on the defense. It covers the traditional area of motive, and juries cling to that kind of evidence. This could be the pivotal issue of the case.''</p>
        <p>First on the stand yesterday was Dr. Stanley Bone, who said he had had two consultations with Dr. Bierenbaum in November 1983. With his own lawyer in the courtroom, Dr. Bone said that Dr. Bierenbaum had ''authorized and directed'' him to speak with his wife.</p>
        <p>When asked by an assistant district attorney, Adam Kaufman, whether he warned Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum that her life might be in danger, Dr. Bone answered, ''Yes.''</p>
        <p>But when asked why Dr. Bierenbaum allowed this, Dr. Bone said, ''This is a trial, a legal case; I don't feel comfortable answering.''</p>
        <p>While acknowledging a desire to protect the doctor-patient relationship, Judge Crocker Snyder said, ''I have to direct you to answer.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Bone then explained that Dr. Bierenbaum asked him to speak to his wife because, ''It doesn't help him if he's in a position to do anything that causes harm to his wife.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, Dr. Shelley Juran took the stand and, with similar hesitation, recounted how Dr. Bierenbaum ''put no limitation'' on her speaking to his wife and how she warned Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum of potential danger.</p>
        <p>When asked by prosecutors why she sought to speak with his wife, and did so over the phone, she answered, ''I wanted to hear her voice because I was concerned for her safety.''</p>
        <p>After the hearing, which is to continue next week, Dr. Juran paused outside the courtroom and said: ''It's a very hard position to be in. You have your responsibility to a client.'' But she added that there also were ''judges and the rule of law; I know we're at the edge of possible new legal ground.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 9, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about preparations in Manhattan for the trial of Dr. Robert Bierenbaum, who is accused of having killed his wife, Gail Katz-Bierenbaum, misstated prosecutors' arguments for allowing testimony by two psychiatrists who treated him before she disappeared in 1985. The prosecutors argued that because Dr. Bierenbaum permitted the psychiatrists to warn his wife and his parents that Ms. Katz-Bierenbaum might be in danger, he had waived his right to confidentiality. The prosecutors did not argue that the psychiatrists had waived it.</p>
