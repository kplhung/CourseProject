        <p>Ted Koppel, the anchor of the ABC News ''Nightline'' program since it made its debut in 1980, has agreed to stay with the program for the next five years, though he will appear as the anchor less frequently, executives announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Under a five-year contract with ABC News that he signed yesterday, Mr. Koppel will be the anchor three nights a week, starting in January. He had previously been under contract to be the anchor for the program, which is shown Mondays through Fridays at 11:35 p.m., four nights a week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koppel has also agreed to be the host of six special weeklong ''Nightline'' series a year and, when important news breaks, to be the anchor of prime-time editions of the program.</p>
        <p>''Nightline'' has been a strong ratings performer for two decades, though it has shown some weakness recently. With an average of 4.4 million people tuning in each night, its audience is down about 9 percent compared with this time last year.</p>
        <p>For months, Mr. Koppel, 60, had been telegraphing a desire for a diminished role with ''Nightline'' so he could pursue opportunities on the Internet and at the same time prepare to make way for a successor. He said yesterday that he believed the new contract would allow him to do that.</p>
        <p>''I've been saying that I believe that a prudent thing to do is to have a transition period that is so long and so gradual and so smooth that when it finally happens, the public won't even notice it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koppel said that he will spend some of his time developing ''Nightline'' programming for the ABC News Web site with the help of his  executive producer, Tom Bettag.  ABC has assigned Tom Sievers, the ''Nightline'' senior field producer, to oversee the program daily.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 9, 2000, Saturday  An article in Business Day yesterday about the decision of Ted Koppel, anchor of ABC News's ''Nightline,'' to sign a new five-year contract with the program misstated the given name of a new executive producer who will oversee it. He is Leroy Sievers, not Tom.</p>
