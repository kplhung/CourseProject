      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Although Karen Mason left Chicago many years ago to pursue a musical theater career in New York City, this likable, high-strung performer still exudes the zany effervescence of an ambitious hometown drama student from the Midwest who has just arrived in town, bursting with a starry-eyed optimism. The locus of her sensibility is 1966 or thereabouts, and the Manhattan of her dreams is a ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' world of madcap romantic sophistication.</p>
        <p>That sense of time warp is established in the opening number of Ms. Mason's new cabaret show, which runs at Arci's Place through Oct. 15. This medley of ''Tonight'' (from  ''West Side Story''), ''Out of This World'' and ''Steppin' Out'' cleverly strings the songs together with fragments from other songs from ''West Side Story.''</p>

        <p>Although Karen Mason left Chicago many years ago to pursue a musical theater career in New York City, this likable, high-strung performer still exudes the zany effervescence of an ambitious hometown drama student from the Midwest who has just arrived in town, bursting with a starry-eyed optimism. The locus of her sensibility is 1966 or thereabouts, and the Manhattan of her dreams is a ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' world of madcap romantic sophistication.</p>
        <p>That sense of time warp is established in the opening number of Ms. Mason's new cabaret show, which runs at Arci's Place through Oct. 15. This medley of ''Tonight'' (from  ''West Side Story''), ''Out of This World'' and ''Steppin' Out'' cleverly strings the songs together with fragments from other songs from ''West Side Story.''</p>
        <p>The nostalgic mood is lightened by Cy Coleman and Carolyn Leigh's kick-up-your-heels bossa nova, ''When in Rome,'' a song that embodies a now-quaint 60's notion of raciness, and ''The Boy From . . .,'' Mary Rodgers and Stephen Sondheim's still funny spoof of ''The Girl From Ipanema,'' from ''The Mad Show.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mason is at her best when being playful and not trying too hard. The most effective ballad in her show, Leslie Bricusse's sobbingly romantic ''You and I,'' is gently confided instead of belted.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Mason is overly fond of the stentorian gesture. When she pushes her astringent voice to its limits at the ends of big ballads, her singing takes on an air of straining determination. That approach is particularly grating in a slowed-down, inflated rendition of the Beatles' ''Help'' attached to Mr. Sondheim's cabaret war horse ''Being Alive.'' And not even Ms. Mason's obvious sincerity can salvage ''We Never Ran Out of Love,'' a trite pop-country ballad composed by her husband, Paul Rolnick.</p>
