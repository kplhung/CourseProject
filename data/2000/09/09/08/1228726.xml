        <p>Target Stores has given $1 million to a contemporary art program at Madison Square Park. The initiative, part of a restoration of the park between 23rd and 26th Streets from Madison to Fifth Avenues, will feature work by an international group of artists including Tony Oursler, Ron Mueck, Janet Cardiff and Yutaka Stone.</p>
        <p>The gift, announced this week by the City Parks Foundation and the Parks and Recreation Department, is an effort by Target to establish a presence in Manhattan, where it does not yet have stores.</p>
        <p>''We give $1 million each week to communities across America,'' said John Remington, Target's vice president for special events and publicity. ''We thought this was a way we could make Madison Square Park an exciting cultural destination.''</p>
        <p>Deborah Landau, director of the City Parks Foundation, said the foundation wanted the park to have a distinct identity. It asked the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit organization that presents public art projects around the city, to come up with a creative program.</p>
        <p>''One of the difficulties of a project of this scale is fund-raising in order to be able to do a knock-your-socks-off kind of program,'' said Susan K. Freedman, president of the Public Art Fund. ''At the same time, we learned of Target's interest in getting involved in a meaningful art project.''</p>
        <p>A three-year plan for the park will begin with Mr. Oursler's ''Influence Machine,'' in which the installation artist will project ghostly images onto artificial smoke and the parks' trees and paths. It will be on view Oct. 19 to 31 from sunset to 9 p.m. A group show is planned for late May.</p>
        <p>A Picasso Rarity</p>
        <p>Just as Christie's is packing up the highlights of its Nov. 8 sale of Impressionist and modern art, for an international tour beginning in London on Sept. 15, the auction house is approaching important collectors about a rare painting from Picasso's Blue Period. ''Woman With Crossed Arms,'' a portrait the artist painted in Barcelona in 1902, is expected to sell for around $25 million.</p>
        <p>The work, which shows a glum-looking woman seated against a background of rich blues, has been owned by Mr. and Mrs. Chauncey McCormick, Chicago collectors, since 1936. Besides being included in many Picasso exhibitions (including  the first retrospective of the artist's work, in Paris in 1932), it was on view at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of ''Picasso in Chicago'' in 1968. The painting remained there on loan until 1972.</p>
        <p>The last Blue Period Picasso to come up at auction was a portrait of the artist Angel Fernandez de Soto, bought by the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber for $29.1 million at Sotheby's in New York in 1995.</p>
        <p>Transforming Dia</p>
        <p>As Chelsea continues to boom, so does the Dia Center for the Arts. With the increased traffic of gallery-goers to the West 20's every weekend, Dia is so packed that its ground- floor space at 548 West 22nd Street needed to be renovated to accommodate the crowds. But rather than hire a traditional architect or designer, Dia turned over the challenge to Jorge Pardo, the Los Angeles artist known for his design-based creations.</p>
        <p>The concept of transforming Dia's 9,000-square-foot ground floor into an artwork fits nicely with other artist-created portions of the institution. Eighteen trees and stone columns that line the block are by Joseph Beuys; Dan Flavin's fluorescent work lights up the stairways; and Dan Graham created a rooftop park.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pardo has changed the facade, adding windows and enlarging existing ones. He also reconfigured the lobby, moving the main entrance and making the reception and ticketing areas more accessible. But perhaps the most noticeable part of his design -- one that extends from the lobby into the gallery space and enlarged bookshop -- is the addition of tilework in bright lime, lemon, yellow and mustard green covering the floors and the columns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pardo has added large glass dividers, and is also visually connecting the space by creating murals that will be abstract, biomorphic, brightly colored forms throughout the floor.</p>
        <p>''It's all about tempting the edges between art, design and architecture,'' said Michael Govan, the director of Dia.</p>
        <p>A Festival Downtown</p>
        <p>The eighth annual Downtown Arts Festival begins today and runs through Sept. 24, with more than 40 galleries and 10 performance sites  participating. This year the festival has added a contemporary French art and performance series. It will also continue to present tours by dealers of galleries in Chelsea and SoHo along with talks by artists. The art walks begin tomorrow in Chelsea. Information and schedules are available at the N.Y.C. Lab School, 333 West 17th Street, (212) 691-6119.</p>
        <p>Picking a Team</p>
        <p>It has been nearly a year since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought Phillips and only now is the company putting together a team to oversee the auction house. This week it announced the formation of a six-member board.</p>
        <p>Lord Powell of Bayswater, a former foreign affairs and defense adviser to Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, was named the company's chairman in April. The board also includes Mario d'Urso, an Italian senator who lives in Rome; J. Carter Brown, director emeritus of the National Gallery in Washington; Sir Joseph Hotung, a Hong Kong real-estate developer; Gert-Rudolf Flick, a London-based collector; Lord Camoys, lord-in-waiting to Queen Elizabeth II and a former deputy chairman of Sotheby's; and the Duke of Lugo, a manager director and senior adviser at Credit Suisse First Boston in Madrid.</p>
        <p>Phillips has also appointed Thierry Millerand as its director of French and Contintental furniture worldwide. Mr. Millerand, who began his new job this week, left Sotheby's in February after 27 years.</p>
        <p>INSIDE ART  Correction:  September 9, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, a report in the Inside Art column of Weekend yesterday about the Downtown Arts Festival misstated the role of the NYC Lab School, at 333 West 17th Street. It is giving out festival schedules, not operating an information line. The festival information number is (212) 243-7656.</p>
