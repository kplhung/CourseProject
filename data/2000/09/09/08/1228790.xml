        <p>The 27,000-member New York City Patrolmen's Benevolent Association endorsed Representative Rick A. Lazio for Senate yesterday. Patrick J. Lynch, the president of the association, said that Mr. Lazio ''does not jump on the bandwagon of criticism unreasonably at a time when it's difficult to be a New York City police officer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch was referring to a statement made in January by Mr. Lazio's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who referred to the ''murder of Amadou Diallo'' shortly before the trial of the four police officers who shot Mr. Diallo. The four officers were subsequently acquitted. Although Mrs. Clinton has said she misspoke and has apologized for the remark, Mr. Lynch has not forgotten.</p>
        <p>''She went so far, although apologizing, to call us murderers,'' Mr. Lynch said during a news conference with Mr. Lazio on the steps of City Hall, the site of near-constant political endorsements for local candidates these days. A New York City police officer, Mr. Lynch added, ''takes offense to that.'' Mr. Lynch added that Mrs. Clinton's statement was ''one of many'' she has made against the police.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch praised Mr. Lazio for supporting higher pay for New York City police officers and for opposing federal oversight of the department.  The possibility of such oversight is now being negotiated between City Hall and the United States attorney's office in the Eastern District of New York.</p>
        <p>Although the endorsement by the city's police officers was not unexpected, it was a boost for Mr. Lazio, whose relatively lax campaign pace has worried state Republicans in recent weeks. ''This endorsement means a great deal to me,'' Mr. Lazio said at the news conference, adding that ''as a former prosecutor and as the son-in-law of a former New York City detective, I know very well how difficult this job is.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign pointed out that Mr. Lazio voted in 1995 with other Republicans against a Clinton administration program that eventually put 100,000 more police officers on the nation's streets, including more than 11,000 in New York State. Mr. Lazio countered that his vote was based on his desire to see local control of decisions about policing. ''The question is whether Washington is going to dictate how that money's going to be spent or whether we're going to spend it on our own priorities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the 1998 New York Senate race, the association supported the Republican incumbent, Alfonse M. D'Amato, over then-Representative Charles E. Schumer, who won.</p>
