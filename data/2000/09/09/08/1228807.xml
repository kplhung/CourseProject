        <p>Long after most other unions had backed Vice President Al Gore for president, the Teamsters' executive board gave him its endorsement yesterday. Despite the long wait, James P. Hoffa, the union's president, said the decision was easy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffa said he pushed his board to make the endorsement after he held extensive talks with Mr. Gore in the past few months and after the vice president began speaking on issues important to working families, something Mr. Hoffa said he had urged him to do.</p>
        <p>''He has come out of the Democratic convention speaking about issues that are important to working families,'' said Mr. Hoffa, who was in New York for a campaign rally with Hillary Rodham Clinton. ''He's talking about the middle class. He's talking about the fact that we need help on health care, education, paying off the debt, and I think what he says makes sense.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffa denied suggestions by some political analysts that he was a fair-weather friend who had embraced Mr. Gore only after the vice president became the front-runner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffa insisted in an interview that he had planned all along to put off an endorsement until after the conventions and after Teamsters' members and leaders were polled.</p>
        <p>Some labor officials said Mr. Hoffa, as the new leader of the Teamsters, also wanted to show that he was his own man and would not automatically join union leaders who heeded the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, John J. Sweeney, and quickly endorsed Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Gore lobbied for the China trade bill last May, Mr. Hoffa sometimes sounded so angry with the vice president that there appeared to be little chance the International Brotherhood of Teamsters would back him. Mr. Hoffa attacked the China trade deal because it did not provide protections for workers and because he feared it would encourage American companies to transfer operations to China.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hoffa said yesterday that Mr. Gore had given assurances on trade.</p>
        <p>''He's said he's going to try to work on trade issues to make sure there is input from labor and environmentalists with regard to future trade deals,'' said Mr. Hoffa, who describes himself as a progressive Democrat.</p>
        <p>While some other labor leaders, like Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, seek to endorse candidates early, believing that is the best way to maximize influence, Mr. Hoffa's strategy has been to hold off in the hope that candidates will make many promises and commitments to secure his endorsement.</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Gore had indicated that he was far more likely than Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to pick judges and members of the National Labor Relations Board favorable to labor. He added that Mr. Gore had made no commitments on one of Mr. Hoffa's priorities: persuading the federal government to end 11 years of intensive supervision aimed at rooting out corruption in the Teamsters.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Hoffa's aides said the Republican Party had vigorously wooed Mr. Hoffa. The aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Republicans had promised to make Mr. Hoffa labor's main liaison with the White House and give him a say in labor-related appointments, if he endorsed Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoffa declined to criticize Mr. Bush, saying the Teamsters wanted to improve relations with Republican lawmakers. He said the Teamsters have endorsed several Republicans  who have often sided with labor, including Representatives Peter T. King of Long Island and Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey.</p>
