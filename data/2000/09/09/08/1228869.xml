        <p>Hirschl &amp; Adler  21 East 70th Street  Manhattan  Through next Friday</p>
        <p>Maybe there is an important exhibition to be done about the classical impulse in contemporary art. ''New York Classicism Now,'' inspired in part by the best-selling author and crusading anti-Modernist Tom Wolfe, is not it. This confusing mix of representational and abstract paintings, drawings and sculptures sheds little light on the nature of, or the need for, contemporary classicism.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the show equates classicism broadly with old-fashioned representational painting. Of the artists, 20 have studied (or, in one case, taught) at the New York Academy of Art, a school that specializes in teaching premodern modes of figurative representation. These artists are all competent but unexciting technicians. Their works include Graydon Parrish's absurdly solemn French Academy-style funeral allegory depicting beefy, grieving male nudes and a dead child on a fancy, antique raft; a glossy, Chardinesque picture of an old electric mixer by John Morra; and Mikel Glass's deft, Fairfield Porter-style portrait of a man in red long underwear.</p>
        <p>The show's best painters, however, are from other schools. Shoichi Akutsu paints delicate images of pieces of notebook paper taped to studio walls; Christopher Gallego presents three large studio interiors painted with intensely observant sensitivity; and William Kennon makes precise but atmospheric rooftop views from his studio window.</p>
        <p>While a definition of classicism that would convincingly embrace all the different styles of painting on view remains in doubt, the situation is further confused by the inclusion of artists who work abstractly or conceptually. There are confectionery color-field paintings by Jennifer Riley and an absorbingly complex geometric structure made of little wooden blocks by John Powers. Kathleen Gilje, a professional painting conservator, makes careful copies of old master paintings, adding incongruous modern elements like tattoos on Leonardo's ''Lady With Ermine,'' and James Drake shows drawn or photographic images based on sign language used by women in Texas prisons. A life-size sculpture of a man in an overcoat holding a shovel was cast in dirt by James Croak.</p>
        <p>Conscientious craftsmanship, disregard for ultrahip avant-gardism and rejection of extreme idiosyncrasy characterize most of the works in the show, but surely the idea of classicism should entail something more positively coherent -- morally as well as aesthetically -- than the puzzlingly eclectic conservativism on display here.</p>
