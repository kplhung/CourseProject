        <p>For someone who doesn't have much truck with the schematic approach of those blustering screenwriting teachers who've become legends in Los Angeles, Christopher McQuarrie writes scripts that are meticulously worked out and lovingly hand-polished; they glow with pride.</p>
        <p>He won an Academy Award for best screenplay for the stylish sleight-of-hand of ''The Usual Suspects,'' perhaps the most arbitrarily plotted crime film ever made; you bet that Kevin Spacey is Keyser Soze only because he is having so much fun with the performance. In Mr. McQuarrie's new script, ''The Way of the Gun,'' the action is compartmentalized and the twists come in on a schedule, something the New York subway system should aspire to. Each note is struck to hang in the air for several beats. The movie may feel redundant, but it is stylish and intelligent.</p>

        <p>For someone who doesn't have much truck with the schematic approach of those blustering screenwriting teachers who've become legends in Los Angeles, Christopher McQuarrie writes scripts that are meticulously worked out and lovingly hand-polished; they glow with pride.</p>
        <p>He won an Academy Award for best screenplay for the stylish sleight-of-hand of ''The Usual Suspects,'' perhaps the most arbitrarily plotted crime film ever made; you bet that Kevin Spacey is Keyser Soze only because he is having so much fun with the performance. In Mr. McQuarrie's new script, ''The Way of the Gun,'' the action is compartmentalized and the twists come in on a schedule, something the New York subway system should aspire to. Each note is struck to hang in the air for several beats. The movie may feel redundant, but it is stylish and intelligent.</p>
        <p>''The Way of the Gun'' feels like a more violent and grim version of a Coen brothers film; it could be Quentin Tarantino's ''Raising Arizona.'' Its lead characters are small-time criminals who tend to speak in ambitious and hilariously orotund turns of phrase, and it's a film noir built around the feelings adults have about babies, climaxing with a childbirth and a lengthy gunfight and standoff.</p>
        <p>The, um, heroes go by the names Parker (Ryan Phillippe) and Longbaugh (Benicio Del Toro) -- the real-life surnames of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid -- and they've ended up pursuing a criminal career of ultraviolence (the way of the gun) because what else could they do? When they visit a sperm bank in an attempt to contribute to the future and make a few bucks at the same time, their responses to the standard questions are so garishly outre that it's surprising they don't set off fire alarms. Their options? ''Petty crime and minimum wage,'' Parker says.</p>
        <p>While at the sperm bank, Parker and Longbaugh hatch a plan to kidnap Robin (Juliette Lewis), a young woman doing surrogate mother duty for a wealthy couple, Hale Chidduck (Scott Wilson) and his much younger wife, Francesca (Kristin Lehmann). The forlorn Robin is about to give birth. ''I don't mind if it stays in there forever,'' she drawls.</p>
        <p>Parker and Longbaugh flee with Robin, pursued by a pair of beautifully dressed security guards (Taye Diggs and Nicky Katt) and Joe Sarno (James Caan), Chidduck's special envoy and a fellow given to language as grandiloquent as his prey. ''I can promise you a day of reckoning that you will not live long enough to never forget,'' he snarls, and he uses the word adjudicator so much you suspect he gets a royalty every time he says it.</p>
        <p>Mr. McQuarrie's dialogue -- lines like ''Karma's only justice without satisfaction'' -- is self-conscious and baroque: rococo puffs. The characters' quirks seem to be carved in stone and placed in platinum settings. Despite the deliberateness of his conception -- at one point, during a shootout in a car chase, the characters push their sedans forward with their feet -- Mr. McQuarrie, making his directorial debut, does have an authentic, if somewhat offbeat,  taste for inflating the nihilism of noir. He has a strong feeling for the genre, and the gunfights -- which are louder than the Dolby trailers -- are staged with an undeniable morality, and the characters imbued with a sense of inevitability. They know what's going to happen to them, and proceed anyway, as if finding honor lying under the wheels of an oncoming Fate.</p>
        <p>Mr. McQuarrie understands how to direct actors, and he gets what he wants from them. Ms. Lewis, a mom-to-be with a face that suggest an infant's, is an interesting choice for the role. Robin represents hope and the future and is most unwilling to change, but it's hard to tell if she is meant to be determined or childishly stubborn. Ms. Lewis makes her both, with a rapt delivery that is surprisingly loud; her dreamy foghorn of a voice has a life of its own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillippe is the real surprise. His angel-boy face is hidden under wiry scrubs of facial hair, and he uses a runty voice as if he had studied the Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino of the 1970's. (He sounds particularly like the Pacino of ''Serpico,'' speaking as if he burned the roof of his mouth.) Mr. Del Toro, whose turn in ''Suspects'' was so freaky it was like watching a live action Dick Tracy villain, is more understated here. He is a mesmerized soldier of fortune, simultaneously out of it and wary. He's even dressed like a revisionist western hero.</p>
        <p>Unlike ''The Usual Suspects,'' ''The Way of the Gun'' is not intentionally vague. (In the earlier film, there may have been a tiny clue; during the invasion of the ship in the movie's climax, Mr. Spacey's Verbal Kint recognizes the language of the sailors, which was also Soze's native tongue.) And this picture remains true to its own internal logic. All the pieces fit snugly together.</p>
        <p>Mr. McQuarrie is smart about moviemaking in ways that show his respect for the genre, and he doesn't force the material on audiences. He knows that part of the enjoyment they will get is in knowing they've seen movies like this before that weren't so direct and intense. He uses a few pop songs, but the score is mostly simple, with scenes highlighted by oboe and timpani.</p>
        <p>Reflecting that entertaining pointedness, one of the best scenes takes place when Parker hands his hostage a sandwich and she tears into it. ''It's from a gas station,'' he says patronizingly. ''It's still good,'' she responds, dealing with what's right in front of her. That's the strength of ''The Way of the Gun.'' It's a song you've heard before, but each chord is hit with extraordinary concentration.</p>
        <p>''The Way of the Gun'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes numerous gun battles, a long torture scene and a bloody childbirth.</p>
        <p>THE WAY OF THE GUN  Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie; director of photography, Dick Pope; edited by Stephen Semel; music by Joe Kraemer; production designer, Maia Javan; produced by Kenneth Kokin; released by Artisan Entertainment. Running time: 120 minutes. This film is rated R.</p>
        <p>WITH: Ryan Phillippe (Parker), Benicio Del Toro (Longbaugh), Juliette Lewis (Robin), Taye Diggs (Jeffers), Nicky Katt (Obecks), Scott Wilson (Hale Chidduck), James Caan (Joe Sarno) and Kristin Lehmann (Francesca Chidduck).</p>
