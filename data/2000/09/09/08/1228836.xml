        <p>A report in the Company News column of Business Day yesterday about a contract for energy management services received by a unit of the Enron Corporation misspelled the name of the company that awarded the contract. It was Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc., not Starwoods. The report also misstated part of the terms. The Enron unit will supply electricity and natural gas to six brands of Starwood-owned hotels in North America, not six hotels.</p>
