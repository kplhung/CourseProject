        <p>EDWARD B. WHITE is passionate about his golf game. ''Hitting a tiny ball one-eighth of a mile and having it land where you want takes incredible skill,'' Mr. White said. With a handicap of 12, he is no Tiger Woods. ''If I weren't so busy managing money,'' he said of his time-consuming job running the $91.7 million GW &amp; K Equity fund, ''I could get it down to a 4 or 5.''</p>
        <p>But he has certainly beaten par for his investors. The fund returned 27.37 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Aug. 31, according to Morningstar Inc., putting it in first place in its peer group of large value funds, which returned 9.68 percent on average.</p>
        <p>Mr. White, 56, uses a bottom-up investment strategy, and balances the fund's big blue-chip companies with lesser-known, smaller companies with market capitalizations of $250 million to $1.5 billion.</p>
        <p>''The market is less efficient with companies that aren't in the radar scope of most Wall Street analysts, because their market caps or revenues are too small,'' Mr. White said from his Boston office, which overlooks the Charles River. ''That's where we find future all-stars when they're still draft choices.''</p>
        <p>Although classified as a large value fund, GW&amp; K combines value plays, defined as attractive businesses that sell at discounted price-to-earnings or price-to-book multiples to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, with growth companies, those with rising earnings or sales. And it holds both large and small companies.</p>
        <p>The diversity in styles, sectors and company sizes helps the odds that the fund will perform well in all types of markets, Mr. White said.</p>
        <p>Gannett, Welsh &amp; Kotler, the fund's sponsor, manages $3.7 billion,  primarily for wealthy individuals. The fund was created in 1996 from a limited partnership the company started in 1991 to invest clients' annual gifts to their children, grandchildren or others. In June, it added two more funds: GW &amp; K Small-Cap Growth and Large-Cap Growth.</p>
        <p>In the Equity fund, Mr. White starts by screening the nation's roughly 10,000 publicly traded companies for those with revenue growth of at least 10 percent a year and above-average and rising profit margins in their industry. That whittles his universe to about 500 companies.</p>
        <p>Then he works with four analysts to review company fundamentals and to pick the fund's 50 or so stocks. His main goal is to understand why a company is growing consistently and whether it can keep doing so.</p>
        <p>One key is analysis of a company's product. What is its competitive position? Is its edge based on superior service? Design? Technology? Or is the company just lucky? To get answers, Mr. White talks to customers, competitors and analysts.</p>
        <p>Company management is also important, especially among smaller holdings.</p>
        <p>''Bigger companies like Merck and Pepsi-Cola have deep management teams, and they're constantly quizzed by analysts,'' he said. ''In the small-cap world, those checks and balances are missing.''</p>
        <p>HE examines how companies reflect two modern themes: productivity enhancements of the technology revolution, and transfer of wealth to baby boomers as their parents age.</p>
        <p>Technology accounts for the largest percentage of the fund, at 28.4 percent of assets, but Mr. White says, ''I've never bought a dot-com stock.''  He prefers companies that provide Internet infrastructure, like semiconductor, data storage and fiber optics businesses.</p>
        <p>He keeps a sharp eye on prices. While he generally wants a company to have a price-to-earnings ratio no higher than its earnings growth rate, he may pay up to twice that rate for a business that is growing rapidly.</p>
        <p>Mr. White buys stocks with the goal of holding them at least five years, but he may sell if profit margins stop expanding or because of deteriorating company or industry fundamentals. The turnover rate is a relatively low 30 percent a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. White likes Equity Office Properties, a real estate investment trust in Chicago that owns and operates Class A office space nationwide, mainly in Boston, Washington, New York and San Francisco, where demand is particularly strong. He bought shares in June, when its price fell to $24.28 because of rising interest rates. He got a close-up view of its operations when it bought the Boston building where he works; he learned, for example, that management offered tenants good deals from telephone, Internet and other service providers. In 1999, the REIT's revenue rose 15.6 percent.</p>
        <p>The stock now trades at $29.00, or 10.2 times his 2001 earnings projection of $2.85 a share. His 12-month price target for the stock is $36.</p>
        <p>Another favorite is the Techne Corporation, a science and biotechnology company in Minneapolis. Techne makes cytokines, blood substances that help regulate the immune system, he said. It markets them to biotechnology and drug companies for research, drug development and drug delivery systems.</p>
        <p>''It has tremendous potential to help find better drugs and better ways to get them to the right part of the body,'' he said, praising the chief executive, Thomas Oland, as a ''deeply committed scientist.'' The company's revenue grew 35.1 percent last year.</p>
        <p>He bought shares in February at about $75.25. They now trade at $101.88, or 82.2 times his estimated earnings of $1.24 a share for the year ending in June 2001. His 12-month price target is $180.</p>
        <p>He also likes the AES Corporation, an independent power producer based in Arlington, Va. He bought shares in 1991 at about $4.50 after federal deregulation of the power industry.</p>
        <p>AES builds relatively small power plants in developing communities and for isolated manufacturing or commercial facilities. Mr. White likes the company's management, adding that environmental safety was among its primary concerns. Revenue grew 35.7 percent in 1999.  The shares are now at $67.00, or 45 times his projected 2001 earnings of $1.49 a share.</p>
