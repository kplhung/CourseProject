        <p>The postcard print, a colorful travelogue fabric for dresses and skirts, was the whimsical motif of summer. Its strips of postcards circle international monuments in cities like Montreal and Hong Kong, where the designs come from. The most popular depicts St. Peter's Basilica, with Swiss Guards and a papal coat of arms, surrounded by a colonnade of postcards. It was worn for day and evening. The fabric and colors recall dress prints by Marcel Vertes and Christian Berard that Schiaparelli popularized before World War II, worn here throughout the war. This summer, they seemed to be saying, ''Having a marvelous time.''</p>
