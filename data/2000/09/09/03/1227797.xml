        <p>Saying there had been progress in negotiations, the union representing nearly 8,000 Bridgestone/Firestone workers told its members to remain on the job yesterday even though the union and company had not reached a settlement before the strike deadline.</p>
        <p>Officials with the union, the United Steelworkers of America, warned nonetheless that the talks, in St. Louis, could still break down and that they could still call a strike after the 12:01 a.m. deadline had passed.

        <p>Saying there had been progress in negotiations, the union representing nearly 8,000 Bridgestone/Firestone workers told its members to remain on the job yesterday even though the union and company had not reached a settlement before the strike deadline.</p>
        <p>Officials with the union, the United Steelworkers of America, warned nonetheless that the talks, in St. Louis, could still break down and that they could still call a strike after the 12:01 a.m. deadline had passed. But Bridgestone/Firestone officials sounded upbeat about reaching a tentative contract and averting a walkout threatened at 9 of the company's 11 factories in the United States.</p>
        <p>Cynthia McCafferty, a company spokeswoman, said in an interview yesterday: ''The negotiators worked past the deadline last night, and we are encouraged by the progress that's been made. There are still some remaining issues and we are continuing to work to resolve these. We are definitely encouraged.''</p>
        <p>John Duray, a union spokesman, said yesterday evening that the two sides continued to talk, with breaks for naps.</p>
        <p>''If they weren't making progress, we'd probably be on strike,'' he said.  Asked if he was optimistic a strike could be avoided, he said, ''I'll be optimistic when a tentative settlement is in our hands.''</p>
        <p>Both sides refused to say which issues had been settled and which remained on the table. Over the past week the two sides have been focusing on pensions, wages, seniority rights, grievance and arbitration procedures and the company's policy on absences. Under the old contract, pay ranges from $9 an hour for new employees to $19 an hour for experienced workers.</p>
        <p>George Becker, president of United Steelworkers of America, said, ''We have made enough progress over the past two days that the union is willing to continue working while bargaining goes on.''</p>
        <p>A strike would involve workers at factories in Akron, Ohio; Bloomington, Ill.; Decatur, Ill.; Des Moines; Noblesville, Ind.; Oklahoma City;  Russellville, Ark.; LaVergne, Tenn.; and Warren County, Tenn.</p>
        <p>''We're just waiting,'' Harland Smith, a union official in Decatur who has worked for Firestone for about 30 years, said yesterday afternoon. ''We're kind of on standby. We're going to try to do business as usual. But we know at any time we can get a phone call saying, 'Pull them out.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. McCafferty, the company spokeswoman, said: ''We definitely appreciate the decision by the union to stay on the job. The plants are open and production continued uninterrupted.''</p>
        <p>A strike would be another serious blow to a company already in crisis. Bridgestone/Firestone is facing Congressional investigations and dozens of lawsuits after federal regulators linked its tires to accidents causing at least 88 deaths and more than 250 injuries.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 9, the company recalled 6.5 million 15-inch tires used on sport utility vehicles after federal officials disclosed widespread complaints that the tread can separate from the rest of the tire and cause failures that can result in rollovers.</p>
        <p>Bridgestone's situation was complicated on Friday when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration took the unusual step of warning consumers that 1.4 million additional Firestone tires that the company refused to recall could pose a safety risk and should be replaced.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts say a strike would make it harder for Bridge stone/Firestone, which is Japanese-owned, to meet the huge demand of replacing all the recalled tires. The company has said that even without a strike it would not be able to replace the more than 6 million tires until next spring.</p>
        <p>Officials with Bridgestone/Fire stone, which is based in Nashville, said a strike would hardly delay its efforts to work down the backlog. It is airlifting replacement tires from its factories in Japan, and its nonunion factory in Wilson, N.C., is making replacement tires for sport utility vehicles. That factory is not threatened by a strike because it is not covered by a union contract.</p>
        <p>Several labor analysts said the union was acting shrewdly by threatening a strike when Bridgestone/Firestone was vulnerable and badly needed to keep its factories open to work down the backlog. But steelworker officials insisted that they were not trying to hit the company when it was down.</p>
        <p>Instead, they said, the tire workers were growing angry and impatient about the lack of progress in talks after months of negotiations. Most of the 8,000 workers are covered by a contract that expired on April 23.</p>
        <p>In the industry, Bridgestone is known for having worse labor relations than its competitors. Many union members still voice bitterness toward Bridgestone over its widespread use of replacement workers during a 10-month strike that started in July 1994. The union ended the strike in May 1995, but because of the company's extensive use of replacement workers, all the unionized workers were still not taken back to work by 1996, when a new contract was reached.</p>
        <p>Officials from Ford Motor Company said that most of the defective tires were manufactured in the Decatur plant when the tire company was relying on replacement workers.</p>
