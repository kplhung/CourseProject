        <p>IT is almost a rite of passage for promising Shakespearean actors to play ''Hamlet.'' More than most, though, Ralph Fiennes seemed made for the part. Onstage with the Royal Shakespeare Company in a variety of other roles and on screen as the Nazi camp commander in ''Schindler's List,'' he had displayed an intense introspection, a sort of irritable melancholy, that well suited the role of the gloomy Dane. Indeed, when the time came, his ''Hamlet'' was duly acclaimed in London and in New York, where he won a Tony Award for best actor in 1995.</p>
        <p>Yet to Jonathan Kent, who directed Mr. Fiennes in both ''Hamlet'' and a 1997 production of Chekhov's ''Ivanov,'' the slim, ascetic-looking Englishman was no less born to play the ill-fated monarch in Shakespeare's ''Richard II.'' It was also a role that Mr. Fiennes had admired but never performed, since he first saw the play as a teenager in 1980.

        <p>IT is almost a rite of passage for promising Shakespearean actors to play ''Hamlet.'' More than most, though, Ralph Fiennes seemed made for the part. Onstage with the Royal Shakespeare Company in a variety of other roles and on screen as the Nazi camp commander in ''Schindler's List,'' he had displayed an intense introspection, a sort of irritable melancholy, that well suited the role of the gloomy Dane. Indeed, when the time came, his ''Hamlet'' was duly acclaimed in London and in New York, where he won a Tony Award for best actor in 1995.</p>
        <p>Yet to Jonathan Kent, who directed Mr. Fiennes in both ''Hamlet'' and a 1997 production of Chekhov's ''Ivanov,'' the slim, ascetic-looking Englishman was no less born to play the ill-fated monarch in Shakespeare's ''Richard II.'' It was also a role that Mr. Fiennes had admired but never performed, since he first saw the play as a teenager in 1980. When looking for a new chance to work together, actor and director had no trouble agreeing.</p>
        <p>To this fairly obvious choice, however, Mr. Kent, an artistic director of the Almeida Theater Company in London, added a more innovative idea. Why not twin ''Richard II'' with ''Coriolanus,'' another Shakespearean political tragedy, albeit one that is infrequently performed, indeed one that Mr. Fiennes barely knew? To Mr. Kent, the plays not only show constrasting aspects of Shakespeare's genius; they also offer interesting end-of-millennium reflections on the nature of power.</p>
        <p>The result is the program that begins on Wednesday at the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music: 14 performances of ''Richard II'' and 12 of ''Coriolanus'' through Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>In an earlier 14-week run this spring and summer, Mr. Fiennes and an impressive ensemble of British actors presented both plays to packed houses in the unlikely setting of a long-abandoned movie studio in East London. After their New York stop, the performers will travel to Tokyo for a limited run at the Akasaka Theater.</p>
        <p>The idea of presenting two or more plays in repertory is hardly a novelty. Last year, Mr. Kent's productions of Racine's ''Phedre'' and ''Britannicus,'' with Diana Rigg and Toby Stephens in both plays, also went to the Academy after successful runs in London. More daring perhaps is the idea of scheduling two plays on some days, as Mr. Kent did with the Racines and is again doing now, as a way of highlighting their differences and similarities. (The double bills in Brooklyn are scheduled for Sept. 16, 23 and 30.)</p>
        <p>''The plays themselves could not be more different in form,'' Mr. Kent said in an interview before the run ended at the former Gainsborough Film Studio in the London borough of Shoreditch. '' 'Richard II,' with its highly wrought verse, is an exquisite artifact, while 'Coriolanus,' Shakespeare's last tragedy, is almost like free-form jazz. But both are about men and their shadows, about men clad in their roles -- one of a king, the other of a warrior -- who have not developed within that cladding. And as it is stripped away, they must confront themselves.''</p>
        <p>In this case, the burden is on Mr. Fiennes to make the pairing work, although he evidently enjoyed testing his stamina. ''Actually, it's not as exhausting as doing 'Coriolanus' twice in a day, which we did in the previews,'' he said softly, sipping a mug of tea at the studio-turned-theater here. ''But, yes, it is exhausting. It's nice to have the challenge and, at the end of the day, to think, 'Wow, I did 'Richard' and 'Coriolanus.' ''</p>
        <p>One quiet and self-pitying, the other loud and insensitive, both characters nonetheless bring on their own tragedies: Richard II, the narcissistic English monarch who almost frivolously banishes his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, and seizes his land, only to find he has provoked a rebellion that leads to his overthrow and death; and Coriolanus, who, banished from Rome for scorning its citizens, joins forces with his sworn enemy, Tulius Aufidius, only to be dissuaded from sacking Rome by his all-powerful mother and, in the process, to invite his own murder by Aufidius.</p>
        <p>''When I first thought about it,'' Mr. Fiennes recalled, ''it seemed a very unusual pairing of plays. But Richard and Coriolanus are both men in power who cannot handle their power. They're both alone, as it were, isolated by the nature of who they are. They're not good at opening up or arguing or debating. Richard has been conditioned to be king and is unable to see anyone apart from himself in his relationship to God as the divinely appointed ruler. Coriolanus is completely trapped in how he should behave. It's a situation created partly by his mother and partly by him with his impossible arrogance and pride.''</p>
        <p>In their political messages, both plays are also quietly subversive. ''Richard II'' tells of the successful challenge to the divine right of kings that paved the way for constitutional monarchy in 1399. But two centuries later, Shakespeare still risked royal displeasure in writing this play. After the Duke of Essex's abortive rebellion against Elizabeth I, the angry queen had proclaimed, ''I am Richard the Second, know ye not that?'' Shakespeare softened the blow by having the Bishop of Carlisle warn of the ''disorder, horror, fear and mutiny'' that would follow Richard's ouster, but today the play speaks more loudly of the perils of absolute power.</p>
        <p>''Coriolanus,'' on the other hand, has been exploited in modern times by both the right and the left because, in Mr. Kent's words, ''it poses questions and offers no answers.'' Should the Roman citizens have bowed to Coriolanus's authority, or were they right to impose the people's will? In Nazi Germany, the play was presented as a paean to Hitler's strong leadership, which prompted American occupation forces to ban it for eight years after 1945. In East Germany, though, Brecht was soon portraying the Roman masses as Marxist-inspired revolutionaries. A half-century later, Mr. Kent's commoners are clearly defending democracy.</p>
        <p>To the political logic of twinning these plays was added the practical consideration that they are easy to cross-cast. Thus, the rising English actor Linus Roache plays both Bolingbroke and Aufidius; Barbara Jefford is immensely convincing as the Duchess of York in ''Richard II'' and as Coriolanus's viciously ambitious mother, Volumnia; the veteran actor Oliver Ford Davies is the voice of reason as both the Duke of York in ''Richard II'' and Menenius Agrippa, the conciliatory Roman senator, in ''Coriolanus,'' and Emilia Fox plays two long-suffering wives, Richard's Queen Isabel and Coriolanus's Virgilia.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Kent and Mr. Fiennes say they make a point of never reading theater reviews. Had they done so, they would have learned that London critics much preferred ''Richard II'' to ''Coriolanus.''  ''Fiennes comes to the role of Richard as if by genetic destiny,'' wrote Paul Taylor in The Independent. ''The air of petulant self-preoccupation, the arrogantly sensitive beauty, the mannered, disdainful lyricism. In these qualities, character and performer would seem to be soul mates.''</p>
        <p>In ''Coriolanus,'' however, instead of presenting a more orthodox figure of ''authoritarian remoteness,'' as Mr. Fiennes put it, the character is blatantly psychotic, turned into a killing-machine by his mother, reveling in being drenched in blood as he emerges victorious in battle. Most London critics were not won over.</p>
        <p>''This role is a raging warrior, this actor is a melancholy courtier,'' Alastair Macauley wrote in The Financial Times. ''You can see his intelligence and his good intentions, but none of them ever turn hard work into communicative acting.''</p>
        <p>Unanimous plaudits, though, went to the site used for ''Shakespeare in Shoreditch,'' as the program was known here. Successively a power plant, the movie studios where Alfred Hitchcock began his career, and a warehouse, the building was marked for demolition when Mr. Kent won it a one-year respite. The industrial rawness of the setting underlined the emotional and physical violence of ''Richard II'' and ''Coriolanus.''</p>
        <p>IN contrast, Mr. Fiennes's decision to return to the stage after a run of movies, most recently ''Sunshine'' and ''The End of the Affair,'' fell into the ''you can't please everyone'' category. There were those who sniped at the Almeida for playing the star game, using Mr. Fiennes -- as it had Juliette Binoche and Kevin Spacey -- to pull in crowds. But others thought that high-profile stage performances are good for theater for the same reason: they encourage young people to view theater as special. Certainly, Mr. Fiennes's fans would hear that view from him backstage.</p>
        <p>''When my film career started to take off,'' the actor said, ''I was happy to leave theater behind for a while because I had done lots of seasons at the National Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company. I was very happy to work in a different way. But after a while I missed theater, not just doing Shakespeare but also the routine. Going onstage, playing the play right through, no one says cut, no one says stop, no one says there's a plane overhead, no one says you've got a sound problem. There's something very pure and freeing about that, the act of just being on the stage. In the end, if I had to toss between the two, I would go for theater.''</p>
        <p>So, yes, he will be back. And no doubt it will be Shakespeare again. At 37, he believes he is too old for ''Henry V'' and too young for ''King Lear'' or ''The Tempest,'' though he has his eye on ''Macbeth,''  ''Henry IV'' and Iago in ''Othello,'' while Mr. Kent has mentioned ''Pericles.''</p>
        <p>''But going back to Shakespeare never seems like going backward,'' Mr. Fiennes said. ''It's quite simply the most challenging material for any actor to get to grips with. My mother used to put on recordings of Olivier doing Shakespeare. I have always loved language in a dramatic context, particularly Shakespeare. It excites me the way some people get excited by jazz or opera or rock music. It's just thrilling.''</p>
        <p>THEATER  Correction:  September 17, 2000, Sunday  An article on Sept. 3 about Ralph Fiennes's appearances in two plays by Shakespeare at the Brooklyn Academy of Music misspelled the name of the theater critic of The Financial Times, whose review of Mr. Fiennes's performance in ''Coriolanus'' in London was quoted in the article.
