        <p>Cristina Teuscher of New Rochelle was recently elected one of three co-captains of the United States Women's Olympic Swimming team at its Pasadena, Calif., training headquarters. ''It's an honor,'' Teuscher, who won the 200-meter individual medley at the Trials, said by phone. Jenny Thompson and Lindsay Benko are the other co-captains. Teuscher may also swim in the 800-meter freestyle relay, in which she won a gold medal at Atlanta in 1996.</p>
