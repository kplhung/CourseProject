        <p>IF any one drummer should represent the United States in an international percussion festival, Max Roach is a deserving candidate.</p>
        <p>Known as the last of the bebop drummers, Mr. Roach's style transcends jazz and influences musicians of all kinds of popular music. That's why he is headlining the Wesleyan World Percussion Festival, which starts Saturday and continues over three weekends with concerts, workshops and panel discussions.</p>
        <p>''Max Roach is a hero of mine and a great influence on all drummers,'' said the vibraphonist and Wesleyan faculty member Jay Hoggard, who will perform with Mr. Roach and the reeds player Anthony Braxton.</p>
        <p>In a telephone conversation from his home in New York, Mr. Roach said he looks forward to the festival so that he can learn from the other world-class percussionists.</p>
        <p>''American music is constantly changing, just like American culture,'' said Mr. Roach, who will discuss his craft in an open seminar on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. at the Crowell Concert Hall. ''Our music has always been influenced by other cultures, which keeps it new.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roach, 75, never stops trying to learn. That's why he moved from playing in big bands to bebop to avant-garde ensembles. He has experimented with unusual instrument lineups, music for Broadway musicals, television, film and the symphony hall.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roach's mother was a gospel singer who insisted that music of all sorts be learned by everyone in the household. ''My first instrument was the piano,'' said Mr. Roach, who composes at the keyboard. ''My family moved to Brooklyn when I was 6. A fourth-floor walk-up. The people ahead of us couldn't get the piano out, so we inherited it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roach subsequently learned to play the clarinet and the trumpet (''my nemesis,'' he said) before settling on the drums at age 10. By the time he was 18, Mr. Roach was already the house drummer at Monroe's Uptown House. He also joined Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in proto-bop jam sessions at Minton's Playhouse. Soon Mr. Roach was hottest bop drummer in New York.</p>
        <p>''It's funny,'' Mr. Roach said. ''This so-called bebop started because of a tax law in New York City. Because of a 20 percent entertainment tax, ballrooms and clubs couldn't afford to pay big bands. So we had to learn to do more with just a few players. At the time everybody was coming down to 52nd Street to hear Billie Holiday, we were glad to handle the overflow.'' '</p>
        <p>In 1954, Mr. Roach formed a quintet in Los Angeles that included Clifford Brown. It was perhaps the definitive bop group until Mr. Brown's fatal automobile accident in 1956.</p>
        <p>As television brought civil rights protest into American living rooms in 1960, Mr. Roach recorded ''We Insist: Freedom Now Suite,'' a seven-part collaboration with Oscar Brown Jr. Not surprisingly, Mr. Roach saw his career ebb as his political voice flowed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Roach's career caught its second wind during the 70's with M'Boom, a 10-piece percussion group borrowing languages and timbres from contemporary classical music. He later experimented with a double quartet and wrote music for theater, for productions of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and Eugene O'Neill's ''Hairy Ape.'' Mr. Roach said he sees no reason to stop experimenting now.</p>
        <p>''There's no end to the creative process,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Wesleyan World Percussion Festival starts Saturday and continues over three weekends. Max Roach performs with the vibraphonist Jay Hoggard and the reeds player Anthony Braxton at 8 p.m. on Saturday in Crowell Concert Hall at the Wesleyan University Center for the Arts (between Willis Avenue and Washington Terrace, Middletown; 860-685-3355). Tickets are $18, $15 for people over 60.</p>
