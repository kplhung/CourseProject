        <p>Maureen Dowd Op-Ed column says Gov George W Bush is alarmed about Vice Pres Al Gore's leap ahead in polls, and one result from Bush camp is scalding ad designed to rip Gore's truthfulness and ethics; says it is disingenuous for Bush to describe his cheap-shot ad as 'humorous'; says Bush looks sulky about setting debates; says Bush seems to feel he should be trusted to govern without having to prove himself</p>

        <p>The Bush campaign has dissolved into a whiny puddle. The Austin team put out a press release Friday bawling that Joe Lieberman was a big meanie to compare Governor Bush to Barney Rubble.</p>
        <p>You'd think, after the risible rift between Dan Quayle and Murphy Brown, that Republicans would know better than to whinge about fictional characters.</p>
        <p>W.'s attempt to be nasty and nice  at the same time is so lame, it's making me miss Lee Atwater. At least Atwater knew where he wanted to be -- in the gutter.</p>
        <p>The cocky, jagged-edged strategist, a jogging partner and political ally of W. during the '88 campaign, would have snickered at the oxymoron some Bushies have used to describe the ad campaign against Al Gore: soft negative.</p>
        <p>When Atwater ran Poppy's race  against Michael Dukakis, he bragged on a less euphemistic approach: ''Attack and destroy!''</p>
        <p>His fellow dark prince of strategy, Roger Ailes, who helped Atwater turn Willie Horton into a bludgeon, was once asked by a Time reporter if they had any qualms about using Mr. Horton in an ad. ''The only question,'' Ailes replied breezily, ''is whether we depict Willie Horton with a knife in his hand or without it.''</p>
        <p>You can't insist that a scalding ad is soft without looking foolish. Or, as W. himself so memorably put it after  John McCain attacked him in the primary: ''You can't take the high horse and claim the low road.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans' new ad has a female narrator sarcastically mocking Mr. Gore's image on TV as he says he ''took the initiative in creating the Internet'' and as he hangs with Buddhist monks.</p>
        <p>The ad is designed to rip Mr. Gore's truthfulness and ethics. Yet on Friday Mr. Bush defended it by parroting his aides' assertions that it was merely ''humorous'' and ''tongue in cheek.''</p>
        <p>In two short weeks, W. and Al have switched roles, and it's making the Bush campaign nuts. Al is now the sunny one, crowing to The Washington Post that ''the wind is at our backs and it's filling our sails.'' He's 10 points ahead, according to a Newsweek poll. And he's now seen as smarter and better-looking than W., according to a Gallup poll, and also the one voters would rather dine with. Thanks to the big smooch, women have finally cottoned to the Democratic nominee. And suddenly W., who had been loftily promising to restore civility to politics, seems like Slashing, Opportunistic Guy.</p>
        <p>Thrown off his strut, W. veered between impatience and sentimentality talking Friday to The Times's Alison Mitchell and Frank Bruni, and grew misty over the ''amazing experience'' of running for president.</p>
        <p>Besides the cheap-shot ad, W. looks sulky about setting the debates. The Bush family has a proud history of aversion to debates, which don't suit them because of their curious relationship with grammar and because they feel they should be trusted to govern without having to prove themselves.</p>
        <p>But there was something surreal in watching the candidate who is so allergic to details dwelling on every detail of the debate format, from the location (nothing adjacent to anything named after a Democratic president) to the questioners (Larry King would be best) to the furniture (a table instead of podiums would be nice).</p>
        <p>And then there was the dead weight known as Dick Cheney. Mr. Cheney finally faced up to his potential conflict of interest, announcing that, if elected, he would forfeit Halliburton stock options worth about $3.5 million.</p>
        <p>He also released his tax returns, showing why $3.5 million was a piddling sacrifice. His income went from $258,394 in 1992, when he was the Bush secretary of defense who helped direct the Persian Gulf war to save a ritzy gas station called Kuwait and keep American oil prices down, to $4,423,289 in 1999, when he was an avatar of Big Oil.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign might think about using that Cheney financial statement in an ad. Mr. Cheney didn't fare too shabbily in the Democratic economy. His annual income multiplied 17 times during the Clinton-Gore administration. He got a whopping $20 million in 10 years and gave a measly 1 percent to charity.</p>
        <p>But you can see why the guy wants to give himself a bigger tax cut.</p>
