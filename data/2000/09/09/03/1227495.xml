        <p>To the Editor: In his article ''Within the Walls of Lucca, Both Mystery and Music'' (Aug. 13), Bernard Holland says, on the subject of taxi drivers: ''Minimal fleecing -- the furtive surcharge of unspoken tourist tax -- should be accepted with good grace.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps at 20 percent, as per his experience -- although I don't condone cheating at even 1 percent -- but certainly not at 50 percent, as my wife and I were charged.</p>
        <p>We had arranged for a taxi from Florence to Pisa Airport. The driver assured us that the metered fare would be 200,000 to 220,000 lire and the driving time (at 6:45 a.m.) less than an hour. After taking us from Florence in a huge circle around Pisa and driving for 1 hour 35 minutes -- at a fare of 349,500 lire ($163) -- we got to the check-in for our international flight barely 15 minutes before departure.</p>
        <p>After communicating with the staff of the Helvetia &amp; Bristol Hotel, where we had stayed in Florence, we received a written apology and a $50 refund from the driver. His disingenuous apology referred to his inexperience, although he had told us that he had driven to Pisa Airport many times. In any event, the concierge and reception manager of this marvelous hotel obviously don't believe in the unspoken tourist tax either.</p>
