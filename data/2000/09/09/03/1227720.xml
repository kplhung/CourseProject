        <p>Last week, as the United States Open kicked off in Queens, tennis players in Leif Ericson Park rallied around a lesser-known group of courts that the city may make into a roller hockey rink. Proponents say the park's 10 courts are underused, but tennis supporters say they are often full to capacity.</p>
        <p>''We were told that tennis is a dying sport,'' said Kathleen Ryan, who lives across the street from the park and opposes the rink. ''That's news to me, and news to everybody else.''</p>

        <p>Last week, as the United States Open kicked off in Queens, tennis players in Leif Ericson Park rallied around a lesser-known group of courts that the city may make into a roller hockey rink. Proponents say the park's 10 courts are underused, but tennis supporters say they are often full to capacity.</p>
        <p>''We were told that tennis is a dying sport,'' said Kathleen Ryan, who lives across the street from the park and opposes the rink. ''That's news to me, and news to everybody else.''</p>
        <p>The plan, proposed by Councilman Martin J. Golden, would allocate around $650,000 to build a rink over five of the courts, while refurbishing the five remaining ones.</p>
        <p>At a June meeting heavily attended by tennis court supporters, Community Board 10 voted in favor of the rink. ''The asphalt is in disrepair and hockey players are often seen playing in this area,'' said Kirk P. Tzanides, chairman of the board.</p>
        <p>Michael Sinapi, president of the Leif Ericson Tennis Association, said he had collected 1,300 signatures opposing the courts' removal. About 100 tennis supporters rallied at the park last weekend, and will meet again Saturday.</p>
        <p>In addition to reducing the opportunity to play tennis, Mr. Sinapi said, residents fear that the rink will be noisy and intrusive and will cater mostly to adolescent boys.</p>
        <p>''Why would you want to remove an exercise court that is utilized nine months out of the year by kids of all ages, adults and senior citizens to be replaced by a one-season team sport, primarily one small segment of the community?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Kraus, a spokesman for Mr. Golden, said he did not know who would use the rink. ''What the councilman is trying to do here is diversify recreational opportunities in this park,'' he said. ''Not everything is played by everybody.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Sinapi said he had heard that plans included bleachers, a scoreboard, lights and a penalty box, Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said plans had not been drawn up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said the department would monitor the courts to determine whether they are underused.</p>
        <p>''If it's a busy, vital tennis court, then we have to put the rink somewhere else,'' he said, noting that the 17-acre park has other possible sites.</p>
