        <p>Shareholders of Gap Inc. may well wish that their brokers had advised selling months ago -- the stock is down 56.3 percent from a 52-week high of $53.75 on Feb. 4.</p>
        <p>Well, better to warn late than never. On Thursday, a day after Gap reported a 14 percent decline in August sales at its Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic stores open at least a year, PaineWebber announced that Edward M. Kerschner, chairman of its investment policy committee, had removed Gap Inc. from the firm's ''highlighted stocks'' list. That day, the shares fell $3.19, to $22.38; they ended the week at $23.50. Other analysts also lowered their ratings on Gap.</p>
