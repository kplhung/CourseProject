        <p>Here's an update on Mayor Jerry Brown of Oakland, Calif., a k a Moonbeam from two decades back when he was the dreamy philosopher governor of the Golden State, sometimes living in a box (or close to it) but always thinking outside of it.</p>
        <p>Make that meditating outside it.</p>
        <p>He's not running for president now, having failed three times. Rather, he is struggling like any other big-city mayor to remake the down-at-the-heels parts of his town -- and enjoying some successes.</p>
        <p>But New Age guy that he is, he also has this nonprofit ''We The People'' communal thing going in the warehouse he lives in down near the Oakland waterfront, offering yoga and tai chi classes for all who need to get better in touch with themselves, or whatever. As his advertisement in a local paper puts it:</p>
        <p>''Come and learn how yoga enhances your flexibility, strength and balance. You will walk away feeling energized and mindfully centered.''</p>
        <p>Sorry, but the School of Sustainability, an environmental project, didn't make it. And, alas, the rooftop garden is no longer a cooperative.</p>
        <p>But for the next five weeks, there will be free lectures and seminars on 21st-century city living or, as the mayor put it in The San Francisco Chronicle, there will be free-range discussion of ''what the modern world is doing to people, doing to our consciousness, our sense of who we are and what it means to be human.'' He promises the discussion leaders will be a smorgasbord of provocative social historians, architects, linguists, even mathematicians.</p>
        <p>''Aristotle says the unexamined life is not worth living,'' Mr. Brown explains. ''So we're examining.''</p>
