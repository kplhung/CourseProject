        <p>Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat, is favored to win a second term this fall whatever the outcome of the Republican primary next Saturday. But Republicans haven't surrendered yet, anything but.</p>
        <p>Instead, even before they have a nominee (it will probably be John Carlson, a former radio talk show host), they are broadcasting advertisements attacking Mr. Locke. And very tough advertisements they are, as tough as any being run in the country, designed to give the Republican primary winner a quick boost.</p>
        <p>By indirection, they appear to link Mr. Locke to the death of a girl under the protection of the state's welfare department by accusing him of bad management of the department and indifference to the state's methamphetamine problem. The child was beaten to death by her mother, a drug addict, the police say.</p>
        <p>The advertisements, sponsored by the Washington State Republican Party and featuring pictures of the child and drug paraphernalia, never actually call for Mr. Locke's defeat and party officials say they were not produced or paid for with the knowledge of either Republican primary contender. Thus, they qualify as ''issue ads'' and are not subject to normal campaign spending restrictions. But however they ended up on the air, their message seems unmistakable: had Mr. Locke been a better manager and had he pushed for tougher drug laws, the child would still be alive.</p>
        <p>At the end of the advertisements, viewers hear nothing about Mr. Locke's re-election. Rather, they are simply urged to call his office about what they have just seen, a standard format for issue advertisements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Locke has called the advertisements not only lies but ''an appalling tactic.'' But the Republican state chairman, Don Benton, contends they simply point out the governor's ''lack of leadership.''</p>
        <p>The day after the advertisements began running, Mr. Carlson, the Republican primary favorite, began attacking Mr. Locke on the drug issue.</p>
        <p>''The timing is coincidental on this one,'' Mr. Carlson said.</p>
