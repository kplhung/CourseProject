        <p>What are the odds, do you imagine, in a country of around 270 million, that one living president could be directly related to another living one? If you assume that this is a democratic country, and that any adult could potentially be qualified to run for the highest office in the land, and you assume further that the job is open only once every four years and that only one person can fill it, then I think the odds are about the same as the likelihood of a meteorite hitting the White House. And yet here we are in one of the oldest democracies in the world with an even chance of electing in 2000 the son of the man who was elected president in 1988.</p>
        <p>The only other countries that have recently passed power from father to son are North Korea, Jordan and Syria. Even Iran and China don't have hereditary systems of political office. My own homeland, Britain, has a monarchy and a peerage system where heredity is destiny. It is a country renowned for class snobbery and cliquishness, which is one reason I left nearly two decades ago. But no British prime minister has ever been elected whose ancestor also held the office. America itself has only one precedent for such a political lineage -- the Adamses -- but that was at the dawn of the Republic, when a tiny clique of landed white males held power, and when the population was a fraction of what it is today. Subsequent eras saw their share of political dynasties -- think of the Tafts or the Roosevelts or the Browns or the Humphreys -- but none of them enjoyed such a close familial hold on national political power as we are anticipating today.</p>

My own homeland, Britain, has a monarchy and a peerage system where heredity is destiny.

Subsequent eras saw their share of political dynasties -- think of the Tafts or the Roosevelts or the Browns or the Humphreys -- but none of them enjoyed such a close familial hold on national political power as we are anticipating today.</p>
        <p>If the Bush dynasty were a freak occurrence, it might be amusing rather than disturbing. But the Bushes are increasingly not the exception. The family controls two of the largest states in the country and, with George P., is already grooming the next generation. On the other side of the aisle we have Al Gore, whose first political campaign was running for the Congressional seat once held by his daddy. Both parties' conventions were crammed with the nattering nabobs of nepotism. In Philadelphia, a former librarian named Laura Bush gave a prime-time speech on education, while the speaker of the House was shunted to the sidelines. Lynne Cheney spoke in prime time, and Mary Cheney emerged as a leading adviser in her father's campaign. George P. Bush also muscled in on prime time, doing outreach for the Bush campaign to young and Hispanic voters. Was he truly the best qualified of all the young Republicans in the country? There were also addresses by Elizabeth Dole, wife of a former Republican nominee, by Representative Vito Fossella, great-grandson of a former congressman, and Theodore Roosevelt IV, great-grandson of a former president. Their qualifications? Try the gene pool.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, the picture was no prettier. There were no fewer than five members of the Kennedy family onstage at different times -- a record even for their nepotistic excesses. Karenna Gore Schiff, a 27-year-old former journalism intern, gave a major talk, and pundits spoke glowingly of her political future. The vice president's campaign is run by William Daley, brother of the mayor of Chicago -- and son of the former mayor of Chicago. Andrew Cuomo, son of a former governor of New York State and husband of a Kennedy, was also on hand to boost his rising star. And of course, a prime speaking slot was devoted to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for a Senate seat in a state she has barely lived in for the first elected public office of her life. Hmmm. I wonder how that happened. Her career places the United States elite at the same level of democratic accessibility as the those of the Philippines, Sri Lanka or Pakistan, where the wives and daughters of able leaders are expected to continue their legacies. I emigrated for this?</p>
        <p>America was founded on the republican principle of popular self-government, in which the citizenry all had an equal chance -- and responsibility -- to be involved in public life. This republican Constitution was a conscious rebuke to the aristocracies and monarchies of the Old World, an assertion that in America, merit alone would determine who would run the country. But in the 21st century, our political system is characterized by court cronies, family hangers-on and primogeniture. With the Gores and Bushes and Daleys and Kennedys, who needs a House of Lords?</p>
        <p>Sure, a certain amount of nepotism has always been a feature of American life. Many of the former captains of industry passed their companies on to their sons; the entertainment industry is riddled with the offspring and spouses of established stars. But politics is different. Unlike business or entertainment, it is supposed to be the arena in which our democratic values are secured and preserved. It is more important in politics than almost anywhere else that the system be open to all, and be seen to be open to all, so that the voters see themselves as actual participants in a common enterprise rather than as observers of remote dynastic squabbles. And yet, while we worry about the influence of money in buying power, and fret about corporate corruption of our campaign finance system, we seem almost sanguine about the fact that the members of our political leadership are increasingly related to one another.</p>
        <p>It is particularly troubling that this is happening at a time when the country itself is becoming more and more diverse. If anything, the narrow influence of bloodlines should be at an all-time low, not an alarming high. The dangers are not simply that we'll discredit the democratic process itself, but that we'll see national politics descend into family power struggles rather than real issues. So George W. Bush is running in part to avenge his father's defeat in 1992, and Al Gore is running in part to avenge his father's Senate defeat in 1970. Even their ideologies seem soaked in genealogy. In some respects, this election is between the son of Albert Gore Sr., Southern populist, and the grandson of Prescott Bush, bleeding-heart Republican. It's less a War of the Parties than a War of the Roses.</p>
        <p>But why now? The two main culprits, I think, are money and celebrity. The fund-raising requirements in today's electoral circus are so onerous that it is more than a help to have a pre-existing mailing list and money network that belonged to daddy or mommy or hubby. This is a kind of hereditary incumbency, where being related to someone already plugged in gives you a massive head-start. And the power of celebrity is now so great and the media universe so crowded that having a famous name or a famous family is an increasingly priceless asset -- and can outweigh any meritocratic criticism. In the annals of modern nepotism, it is hard to beat John F. Kennedy's appointment of his own brother as attorney general, which established a conflict of interest that could only undermine public confidence in the neutral enforcement of the nation's laws. But the Kennedys' telegenic charm turned their nepotism into an asset. George W. Bush follows in Kennedy's wake. He draws on money and connections unavailable to, say, Gary Bauer, son of a janitor, and charms his way through the rest. It's particularly poignant when you consider that Bush's main primary rival was John McCain, a man who refused to let his own powerful military father pull strings for him as a prisoner of war.</p>
        <p>All of this is only compounded by the current cult of the family. Both Democrats and Republicans vie for the ''pro-family'' moniker, parading children, spouses and relatives in front of the public, rigging the tax system to privilege the married and the fertile. But while loving one's own family is always a private virtue, favoring one's kin in the apportionment of power is surely a public vice. The only word for it is corruption -- and it is as deep and as dispiriting a variety as anything enabled by our campaign finance laws. Some still wonder why voter turnout keeps declining. Did anyone ever point out that in aristocracies, the people don't vote at all? In today's nepotistic nadir, who but the children of the powerful would bother?</p>
