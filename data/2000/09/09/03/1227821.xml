        <p>Hyung-Taik Lee recalled seeing Pete Sampras in the men's locker room last week. He locked eyes with Sampras, the 13-time Grand Slam winner, for a souvenir second before they went their very separate ways.</p>
        <p>Sampras did not remember the encounter, but tomorrow he will merge paths again with Lee, meeting him at Arthur Ashe Stadium for an improbable fourth-round match.</p>
        <p>Lee, a 24-year-old South Korean qualifier who just one week ago was playing in the tennis equivalent of Class AAA baseball, will continue his dizzying New York journey, which began when he bought his own bus ticket in Binghamton, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Lee knows it can all end tomorrow at the United States Open against the world's most renowned player. But he just smiled and shrugged. ''The chances of winning,'' Lee said through a translator, ''are probably not even 50 percent, at best.''</p>
        <p>After winning three straight qualifying matches, Lee, No. 182 in the world, captured three main-draw matches. The third came yesterday, when he upset 67th-ranked Rainer Schuttler of Germany, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, before a chorus of cheers echoing from a large and prideful Korean-American contingent at Court 10.</p>
        <p>And to think Lee's mother did not want him to play tennis as a child in the potato farming village of Hang Sun, in Kang Won Do province. Lee is the first Korean man to reach the second round, let alone the fourth, of a Grand Slam event. ''Everything I do is a record now,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lee's prizes -- Sampras and a guaranteed $55,000 -- are his biggest yet, and he is prepared to counterpunch his idol. ''If I am not in awe of the crowd and the stadium, I'm going to put up a good fight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Korean chants throughout the match lifted Lee yesterday. ''That was huge because he's away and it's like his home court,'' said a translator, Chris Kim, who works for a Korean television network.</p>
        <p>Lee is traveling with his coach, but his two older brothers and his mother live in Seoul. He has not had a chance to call home during his stay in New York, which has included trips to the dentist to fill a cavity and nightly ventures to Koreatown.</p>
        <p>Star Sports broadcast the match live to Korea, where Lee is already the top-ranked player but may be emerging as a national hero. ''We feel very proud,'' said See Hyun Baek, a member of Korea's Davis Cup team in 1965, who was watching in the stands. ''No one has advanced past the first round before.''</p>
        <p>Let alone the first week of the United States Open. This was Lee's second attempt at qualifying for the Open, and he succeeded on his fifth bid to get into a Grand Slam event through the back door.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 11 he was just walking through a bus door. Lee had lost a quarterfinal at the Binghamton challenger, which meant he had to catch a late-night bus to New York to qualify for the GHI Bronx Tennis Classic. Sleeping just three hours, he lost in qualifying but entered the main draw as a lucky loser because another player had an eye infection. Lee won the event, beginning the streak he extended to 11 matches yesterday.</p>
        <p>Not all of his opponents have been minor league. He defeated the 1991 Wimbledon semifinalist David Wheaton in Open qualifying, the United States Olympian Jeff Tarango in the first round of the main draw and then the Argentine Franco Squillari, seeded 13th, in the second round.</p>
        <p>Yesterday Lee dismantled Schuttler. Lee's coach of six years, Won Hong Joo, said his pupil's game compared most to Sampras's. ''His ground strokes are like Sampras's, but not his net game,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lee began playing tennis in fifth grade, two years after his father died. Tennis and athletics in general, explained the translator, are not emphasized in Korean culture, but Lee's elementary school teachers saw promise in him. It was not until he was in college, though, that he attracted the most attention.</p>
        <p>Joo began working with Lee while he was the top-ranked player at Kunkuk University in Seoul. At that point, the electronics company Samsung sponsored Lee, a relationship that affords him comfortable lodging even on the challenger circuit.</p>
        <p>Lee will play for his country at the Olympics, but he has no clear preparation for sudden fame and fortune. ''I might want to come back here and study English,'' Lee said.</p>
        <p>He has a new focus. Before the Open began, Joo bet Lee a $5,000 gold watch that he could get to the second round. Now that Lee has earned more than twice his cache for this year, what will Lee give him? ''Just the pleasure,'' Joo said, smiling and shaking his head.</p>
