        <p>FOR a guy known for fighting mental demons most of his life, Brian Wilson sure sounds happy.</p>

        <p>FOR a guy known for fighting mental demons most of his life, Brian Wilson sure sounds happy.</p>
        <p>''I am having a great, great time,'' said Mr. Wilson, a former Beach Boy. Speaking on the telephone from his Los Angeles home, he described the tour that will bring him, his 10-piece band and a 55-piece orchestra to the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel on Sept. 9.</p>
        <p>''It's quite a sound,'' he said. ''And people love us.''</p>
        <p>Why would he think they wouldn't? After all, the Beach Boys have sold millions of records, creating some of the most popular songs in America's modern musical canon: ''Fun, Fun, Fun,'' ''I Get Around,'' ''California Girls,'' ''Help Me, Rhonda.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson, 58, who had a well-documented battle with mental illness, was the driving creative force that brought the Beach Boys to pop stardom.</p>
        <p>While others might credit innovative production techniques, complex arrangements, odd chord and key changes, airtight harmonies, meaningful lyrics and strong melodies, Mr. Wilson is more modest about the ingredients for success. ''The songs have a lot of soul, and a good beat,'' he said. ''The music is spiritual. It affects everyone.''</p>
        <p>Does he have a favorite Beach Boys song? ''Good Vibrations,'' he said. ''The Beach Boys got lucky with that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson is feeling fortunate, as well, after suffering decades of profound mental, career and personal setbacks, including the deaths of his two bandmate brothers.</p>
        <p>The Beach Boys are credited with popularizing the surf-heavy California Sound. But it seemed lightweight compared to the imaginative explosion that was to be the 1966 album ''Pet Sounds,'' which took them from the beaches of Southern California straight to the doorstep of the Beatles, who became rabid fans.</p>
        <p>After creating everything from novelty hits like ''Surfin' U.S.A.'' to pop classics like ''Wouldn't It Be Nice'' to folk-rock standards like ''Sloop John B'' to polyphonic pop symphonies like ''Heroes and Villains,'' Brian Wilson disappeared. Suffering from depression, panic and agoraphobia, he became a recluse, often lying in bed or playing in a sandbox. The song ''Brian Wilson'' by the Barenaked Ladies includes the hook ''Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did.'' Mr. Wilson sings part of that song in concert.</p>
        <p>After quitting the band in 1964, (Glen Campbell joined), he continued to write and arrange for it. He joined the band for a 1976 tour, only to quit again. On his own now, his sometimes-faltering voice is not the same honeyed vehicle it was when he was 20. But the first-rate band is there to make it all sound right. More important is the repertory. Mr. Wilson is showcased as the composer.</p>
        <p>He is working on a new solo album, but isn't making much progress. ''I have writer's block,'' he said. ''But this tour is keeping me busy. I am having such a great time. It's cool. My wife is with me and things are really good. Life isn't so cruel to me lately.''</p>
        <p>An afterthought: ''But sometimes life just turns back on me.''</p>
        <p>BRIAN WILSON  PNC Bank Arts Center, Exit 116, off the Garden State Parkway, Holmdel.</p>
        <p>Saturday at 8 p.m.  (201) 507-8900.</p>
