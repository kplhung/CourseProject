      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Seventh Street in the East Village is becoming a fashion center, with boutiques opening regularly. One new addition is Cherry Bishop, opened in June by the New Zealand-born designer of the same name. She opened her first store, Halo, in the East Village in 1991. The new location is at 117-119 East Seventh, near First Avenue.</p>
        <p>Colors like spice red, cranberry and plum highlight the classic but trendy day-into-evening clothes. Fashions include fitted shirts with stand collars ($75), 1950's-style fitted jackets ($85), and skirts, dresses, pants and tops.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bishop says she can ''make clothing that actually fits women.'' Sizes run from 2 to 16.</p>
