        <p>WestSide</p>
        <p>Young Men and Hip Hop in L.A.</p>
        <p>By William Shaw.</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, $23.</p>
        <p>Many now prosperous rap artists say that in the inner city neighborhoods where they grew up there were two ''hustles,'' that is, means of rising out of poverty: drug dealing and rapping. In ''Westside,'' William Shaw sets out to find the ''would-be hip-hoppers, the young African-American men who haven't made it yet, the ones . . . who are still dreaming about their houses in the hills.'' He sets his search in Los Angeles, where in the late 1980's the group N.W.A. spearheaded gangsta rap, whose lyrics reflected the guns, gangs and violence of the city's roughest areas. Shaw, a magazine journalist, demonstrates an impressive knowledge of hip-hop; he also provides deep historical context for Los Angeles's black population, from the F.B.I's Black Panther-busting antics in the 1960's to the well-publicized gang rivalries between the Bloods and Crips in the 90's. But the heart of his book is the stories of young men with nicknames like Babyboy, Tibu, Rah and Khop, who have grown up losing friends to gunfire and mourning fathers who are dead or locked up. They have pinned all their hopes on becoming recording stars; as a result, they are broke and often disappointed, and often turn to that other ''hustle'' -- drug dealing -- or to their employed girlfriends. As inherently dramatic as their lives are, however, the stories in ''Westside'' by now are too familiar to be gripping.</p>
