        <p>There was a time when Leonid Aniskin was frightened of radiation. But that was before he went to work at the Chernobyl nuclear power station. He still remembers his first day on the job. It was in 1987, a little over a year after an explosion had ripped the roof off the plant's fourth reactor block. ''The trees in the forest behind the station had all died,'' he recalls. ''The pine needles had turned red and dropped off.''</p>
        <p>Soldiers were burying the radioactive tree trunks when he arrived for his first shift. Everywhere he looked there were men in masks and dark rubber suits, and orange bulldozers scraping away the contaminated soil.</p>
        <p>The station's three undamaged reactors were all up and running by then, ordered back on line by Soviet central planners. While the world was still reeling from a disaster that spewed radiation over much of northern Europe and forced the evacuation of more than 100,000 people, the Kremlin was wrestling with a different issue: where to find workers willing to operate the stricken plant.</p>
        <p>Aniskin was 27 at the time, a champion marathon runner and a newly graduated acoustical engineer. He and his wife, Marina, had just celebrated their first wedding anniversary and the birth of their son, Igor. Like most young couples, they were living in a crowded dormitory near the Kiev airport while waiting for a state apartment in a soulless high-rise. In those days, newlyweds faced years if not decades of communal showers and public toilets before they were assigned their own place.</p>
        <p>There was a way, however, to bypass the waiting list. The Kremlin was building a new city 40 miles from Chernobyl -- just outside the depopulated Exclusion Zone -- a town unimaginably luxurious by Soviet standards. The nation's best builders had been harnessed for the showcase project, and construction crews from eight Soviet republics were working double-time to erect housing districts in the traditional styles of their lands.</p>
        <p>Brand-new apartments were to be had in this ''model city,'' which the Kremlin christened Slavutich after the Russian word for glory, and jobs that paid 10 times the average national wage. All Aniskin had to do to win this Faustian Soviet sweepstakes was sign up to work at Chernobyl.</p>
        <p>''When Igor was born,'' he says, with the conviction of someone looking back on a difficult decision that came out right, ''I decided to offer my family a chance at a better life.''</p>
        <p>It is a warm and breezy Saturday morning in Slavutich. Mothers push baby strollers in the central parade ground, and children play near the memorials to posthumous Heroes of Soviet Labor. In the Riga district, plant bosses tend their flower gardens, while the six-foot-wide Geiger counter over the pediatric wing of the nearby hospital flashes a reassuring 15.4 microroentgens -- about the same as in Denver -- if you stick within city limits, where the contaminated soil has been removed.</p>
        <p>Leonid Aniskin has already run his daily 10 miles and is cooking breakfast for his family and me. The aroma of fish and fried potatoes fills the sunny second-story apartment and drifts into the living room, where Igor, now a tall and big-boned teenager, sits transfixed by a sumo wrestling match on ESPN's Eurosport. Aniskin brings out a pot of coffee and clamps his son in a good-natured headlock. ''You don't want to become like them,'' he gibes in mock horror, pointing to the jiggling giants on the screen.</p>
        <p>''Papa is a little crazy when it comes to exercise,'' announces Igor, who has his father's earnest face to go with short, spiky hair. Aniskin takes the rejoinder in stride. His thick hair may have grown silvery around the edges these past 13 years and he may have lost a step or two, but his sinewy 5-foot-9-inch frame can still carry him across the finish line of a marathon in a most respectable 2 hours and 40 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Papa also loves fishing,'' declares Igor after his father disappears into the kitchen, ''and we always go together after 'Friends.'''</p>
        <p>''Friends,'' dubbed into Russian, is Igor's favorite program. You can catch it only on cable television, an extraordinarily rare sight in the lands of the former Soviet Union. In Slavutich, cable is piped in free of charge to every household, courtesy of Chernobyl.</p>
        <p>Igor likes living in Slavutich. He says there's a lot to do here. There is the music festival arranged by the plant (LaToya Jackson was a recent headliner), swimming and sailing in the Dnieper River, basketball and soccer. There are art classes and weightlifting facilities, judo and gymnastics clubs. There's even Little League, started last year by a United States Department of Energy consultant.</p>
        <p>Nor does Igor lack playmates. Nine thousand of Slavutich's 26,000 residents are children under the age of 16, a result, town fathers proudly note, of the city's astonishing birthrate, the highest in post-Communist Ukraine. ''People can afford to have children here,'' explains Marina Aniskin, as we settle down to breakfast. ''We've had stability,'' she adds. ''It's what sets Slavutich apart from the rest of the country.''</p>
        <p>Between them, the Aniskins bring home the equivalent of $450 a month, which doesn't sound like much until it's compared with an average wage in Ukraine of $38 a month. More important, Chernobyl pays on time and in cash. In the rest of the country, people often get their salaries in tires or sacks of sugar, or not at all.</p>
        <p>''I don't think an outsider can appreciate to what degree Chernobyl has saved us,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Marina Aniskin is an attractive woman in her mid-30's with a warm smile, soft round features and hair the color of Ukraine's famous wheat fields. She was born in Soviet Turkmenistan and raised in Odessa, where many of her friends and family still live -- though she is saddened that some refuse to visit her in Slavutich for fear of radiation.</p>
        <p>It was Marina who first thought about moving the family to Slavutich. ''I used to sit on my cot and dream about getting my own place,'' she recalls. ''So when the opportunity came to get an apartment, we jumped at it. Everything was so new and clean. And the schools and playgrounds were so beautiful. I'd never seen anything like it.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, she and her husband, and the rest of this one-company town's residents, have all learned to live with radiation. The one thing they can't live without, though, is Chernobyl. And Chernobyl is closing.</p>
        <p>In June of this year, the Ukrainian government -- which inherited the plant in 1991 and has kept it running to allay its own crippling energy crisis -- finally bowed to international pressure and agreed to take Chernobyl off-line by Dec. 15. Madeleine Albright, the American secretary of state, calls the shutdown a ''gift to the Ukrainian people.''</p>
        <p>But no one around here sees it that way.</p>
        <p>The train to Chernobyl leaves Slavutich's one-platform station at 7:30 each morning. It's a 40-minute commute, and passengers pass the time catnapping, playing cards or reading newspapers.</p>
        <p>For the first half of the ride, the scenery is bucolic and serene, a tableau of collective farms, dairy herds and gently rolling pastures. The semblance of normalcy fades, however, once the train crosses into the Exclusion Zone. Double rows of barbed-wire fencing and yellow radiation signs announce its perimeter. A few minutes later, deep ditches appear, dug to prevent the cesium and strontium fallout that has leached into the marshy soil from draining into the nearby Dnieper River basin, where 36 million Ukrainians get their drinking water.</p>
        <p>The abandoned settlements start soon after, weedy and overgrown, with peeling walls and moldy roofs decaying from neglect. The radiation level here jumps from 15 microroentgens per hour to 43, no longer safe for human habitation (25 to 30 is considered the limit).</p>
        <p>Then two large red structures loom into view: shells of Chernobyl's incomplete fifth and sixth units, whose construction was halted after the 1986 meltdown. Next to the rusting hulks lies a sandy clearing, where the foundations for two more reactors were to have been poured. Soviet central planners had intended for Chernobyl to be the world's largest nuclear power station rather than its most infamous.</p>
        <p>As the train nears the plant, the landscape turns industrial and gray. Thick power lines sag from high-voltage transformers, and steam pipes snake across concrete pedestals. Closer still, and Chernobyl's big black reactor blocks rise against the low, overcast sky. Passengers stifle yawns, collect their briefcases and make for the doors.</p>
        <p>The train stops at a specially sealed platform with blue corrugated steel walls and translucent rubber flooring. The platform shades into a metallic gold corridor bisected by rows of phone-booth-size radiation detectors, which the plant's 5,940 workers pass through after changing clothes at the end of their shift.</p>
        <p>The uniform at Chernobyl is a tasteful turquoise jumpsuit, black boots and a dosimeter that, like a pager, clips onto the waistband and is measured monthly to track each employee's accumulated exposure. Large Geiger counters are installed throughout the station. The one above the bronze bust of Lenin outside the main administrative offices, where Marina Aniskin works as a bookkeeper, reads 88 microroentgens.</p>
        <p>Her husband has invited me to visit him on the job, and I have accepted with some trepidation. Aniskin works at the so-called sarcophagus, tending the steel and cement tomb that encases 216 tons of uranium and plutonium buried within the remains of the fourth reactor block. His is one of the most dangerous jobs at Chernobyl.</p>
        <p>The sarcophagus stands at the far end of the plant, sharing a divider wall with the third reactor unit, which is still operating. The structure has the rough dimensions of a basketball arena, and its rust-daubed walls are battleship gray. The Geiger counter mounted 100 yards in front of the electrified fence that surrounds the sarcophagus flashes 1,430 microroentgens per hour.</p>
        <p>Beyond this point, radiation at Chernobyl is measured in rem. There are a million microroentgens in one rem, and in some chambers inside the ruined reactor hall the radiation can reach two thousand rem per hour, four times the lethal dose.</p>
        <p>I follow Aniskin down a stairway to a passage that leads under the fence into an underground locker room where radiation suits are issued. We strip down and step into protective gear: double layers of white cotton-weave pants and undershirts, high, astronaut-style boots, a jacket, gloves, a mask and a head covering reminiscent of a short-order cook's.</p>
        <p>We ascend another stairway and emerge directly in front of the sarcophagus. Close up, its surface is a patchwork of cement and metal plating. Its walls are not plumb, straight or true, and several footwide gaps can be seen under the eaves. ''There isn't a single rivet or weld holding it together,'' explains Aniskin. ''The radiation was too high for builders to come near.''</p>
        <p>The entire structure, in fact, was assembled using remote-controlled cranes and giant military helicopters to drop metal beams, sand and concrete on the wrecked reactor. Those helicopters and cranes -- and 12,000 other cement trucks and earth-movers used to clean up the accident -- now sit in a machinery graveyard a few miles from the plant, still too radioactive to touch.</p>
        <p>We enter the sarcophagus -- what was Chernobyl's fourth reactor -- through a narrow staircase near the old turbine hall. At every landing large trays full of water rest on disposable plastic floor mats, and we must step into these so as not to track radioactive dust. An estimated 30 tons of highly contaminated dust covers the rubble inside. Keeping this dust down is one of Aniskin's chief responsibilities.</p>
        <p>The control room is dim; the lights and ceiling tiles have all been removed, as have most of the wiring, dials and knobs from the big instrumentation panel and crescent-shaped console in the center of the chamber. A translucent pink film covers everything, sparkling in the gloom. This is the glue that binds the deadly dust to the walls and ceilings.</p>
        <p>On one panel someone has spray-painted 4/26/86, the date of the explosion, and just outside the control room, on what was once the observation deck, there is a brass plaque and a few plastic tulips to commemorate Valery Khodemchuk. Khodemchuk was the night-shift manager on duty at 1:23 a.m. when the core started overheating during an experiment he was conducting and the reactor's automatic shutdown system did not respond. Khodemchuk rushed to the observation deck just as the pressure inside the core reached a critical mass. He was vaporized.</p>
        <p>A three-foot-thick concrete wall is all that now separates us from the remains of the reactor core, and this is as far as Aniskin says it's safe for me to go. He can see that I'm sweating badly and that it is not from the 100-degree heat inside the sarcophagus. ''Come meet my boss,'' he says, guiding me down a corridor.</p>
        <p>We step into the monitoring station, where his supervisor, Vitaly Borets, is tracking temperature and gamma and neutron activity. Borets, a thickset man in his 60's with a few silver teeth and a sliced-off pinky, is one of only 547 of Chernobyl's 6,000 original personnel who returned to the plant after the accident. He came back, he says, because he grew tired of being treated like a ''leper'' by outsiders. ''When people heard I was an evacuee from Chernobyl, they wouldn't even shake my hand, like I was contagious.''</p>
        <p>Borets is angry about the impending shutdown, which he says is ''stupid,'' and worries where it will leave people like him. ''They told us that if we moved to Slavutich and worked at Chernobyl, we were patriots, we were rendering a great service to the motherland.</p>
        <p>''Well, we came, we took our doses and now it's thank you very much and please leave. I have nowhere else to go,'' he complains. ''And I'm fed up with being played like a human Ping-Pong ball.''</p>
        <p>Aniskin politely interrupts his boss, pointing to the clock on the wall. ''We should go,'' he tells me. ''You shouldn't stay too long.''</p>
        <p>''I can understand how he feels,'' Aniskin confides, as we retrace our steps toward the changing room. ''The government promised to take care of us for the rest of our lives if we came to work here.'' Aniskin is one of the lucky few whose jobs will continue past the plant's closure: for at least five years, or until the completion of a new, $750million, internationally financed dome over the existing sarcophagus.</p>
        <p>After I take a decontamination shower, my dosimeter is measured. During the 20 minutes I spent inside the fourth reactor block I was exposed to one-hundredth of a rem, or 10,000 microroentgens. ''You'll live,'' declares the technician who hands me my readout. Just to be sure, I later ask Alexander Sich, a nuclear-safety expert and a contractor for the United States Department of Energy, for a second opinion. ''It's about the same dose you'd get taking four round-trip trans-Atlantic flights,'' he assures me, explaining that radiation occurs naturally in high altitudes, which is why the measurements in Slavutich are similar to those in the Rocky Mountains. ''The real danger for Chernobyl workers,'' he adds, ''is long-term exposure.''</p>
        <p>Outside the sarcophagus, the sun is poking through the clouds, and workers are heading for their lunch break. There are four cozy commissaries at Chernobyl, and the food is free and served on tables decorated with quaint, red-checkered cloths. I am advised to save my leftovers for the six-foot-long catfish that live in the reactor cooling pond near the sarcophagus. The whiskered creatures weigh up to 300 pounds and can swallow a loaf of bread whole.</p>
        <p>Wildlife is teeming in the depopulated zone around Chernobyl. In fact, the plant's director, Vitaly Tolstonogov, recently hit a moose with his car, and there are now wolves and wild boar roaming the 1,000-square-kilometer area sealed to human settlement. The anomaly has scientists stumped. ''The mammals near the plant are getting doses that we know have to be lethal,'' says Michael H. Smith, a professor of genetics from the University of Georgia. ''But the animals all appear healthy.'' Smith, however, warns that appearances can be deceiving.</p>
        <p>There are approximately 200 people living in the zone, mostly elderly peasants who defied the government ban to return to their evacuated homesteads. One of these is Ivan Tumenok, a sturdy 70-year-old pensioner who grows his own vegetables and says he would be long dead had he stayed in the dreary housing project in Kiev where Soviet authorities resettled him in 1986.</p>
        <p>Tumenok lives in a small, pale-blue clapboard hut surrounded by sunflowers on Proletariat Lane, not far from the old Jewish quarter of Chernobyl, the ancient village from which the plant took its name. ''When the time comes,'' he says, ''we will all die. My wife and I just chose to die here, in our home.'' Tumenok's wife passed away last year of cancer at the age of 60.</p>
        <p>The one place that no one has returned to in the zone is Pripyat, Chernobyl's old housing development, which is sealed off and guarded by soldiers. Once, 50,000 people lived there, including a co-worker of Aniskin's, Sergei Pavlovsky, who agrees to accompany me on a visit to the abandoned town.</p>
        <p>The door to his old ground-floor apartment on Lenin Prospekt stands wide open, and moss has spread over the threshold. Outside, a tree has pushed through the asphalt, and the overgrown courtyard looks like a set for ''Planet of the Apes.'' Pavlovsky, 37, hasn't seen his old place in 14 years, since the evacuation order was given a full 36 hours after the accident, and he is visibly moved to be back in his childhood bedroom. ''My sticker collection,'' he says sadly, wiping the dust off a dresser. On the floor lie his old Za Rulyom magazines, the Soviet version of Car and Driver, and a rock someone has thrown through the window. He picks up the stone and gently places it on the dresser. ''Take a good look around,'' he says, his expression suddenly bitter. ''This is the future of Slavutich.''</p>
        <p>The first thousand layoffs at Chernobyl will be posted in October. Already, says Anatoly Nosovsky, a former head of safety at the plant who now runs a United States-financed lab in Slavutich, senior scientists are starting to flee. ''Some of our experts have moved to Iran,'' he says, flashing a mischievous grin, ''and I'm sure others will follow.''</p>
        <p>Nosovsky is an affable man in his early 50's with an easy manner that belies his military background. Before moving to Slavutich from St. Petersburg, he designed the propulsion systems on the world's largest nuclear submarines, the aircraft-carrier-length Typhoons that carry 200 nuclear warheads apiece.</p>
        <p>''I can understand,'' he argues, ''why the West wants Chernobyl closed. But you have to see the situation from our point of view. We have an energy crisis and power blackouts, and no money to buy natural gas from Russia. People are going to freeze this winter.</p>
        <p>''And then,'' he adds, gesturing toward the neat rows of whitewashed buildings that line Slavutich's Heroes of Chernobyl Street, ''there's the most painful question of what to do with this place''</p>
        <p>Virtually everyone in Slavutich, from the ambulance drivers and kindergarten teachers to the snow-removal crews and the surly waitress at the lone hotel, works for Chernobyl. And even those few who don't collect a paycheck from the power station are bracing for the worst. ''I'll lose my job even though I don't work at the plant,'' predicts Lena Dimitrenko, a 25-year-old redhead from Belarus, who spends her days in a stifling kiosk in the Moscow district selling cigarettes, sticky candy bars and knockoff soft-drink brands. Business has already fallen off sharply, she says. ''We used to sell imported goods, but now it's all cheap Ukrainian stuff. There's no money here anymore.''</p>
        <p>The economic crunch has already begun. Slavutich had no hot water this summer because the local heating plant is storing up fuel for the winter. Such stockpiling and outages are common throughout Ukraine, but this is the first time Slavutich has suffered them.</p>
        <p>The endemic wage arrears that plague the rest of the former Soviet Union are also starting to make their painful presence felt here. ''I haven't been paid in three months,'' grumbles Svetlana Popova, a 30-year-old mother of three who works in the cafeteria at the plant-owned Evropeiski Hotel, where most of Slavutich's 60-odd Westerners live. ''The West is giving all this money for a new sarcophagus, but what about us? This was such a nice and peaceful place, and now look what's happening.''</p>
        <p>Slavutich is indeed changing. The influx of foreigners, which is expected to swell as construction of the new cover starts next year, has spawned the town's first prostitutes. They are called ''screwdriver girls,'' after the drinks they sip while waiting for a lonely Belgian or French engineer. Crime, another unwelcome novelty, is also up, even as budget cuts have slashed the 120-strong police force by a third. ''Our main worry,'' says Yuri Vasilievich, a senior sergeant, ''is when the plant closes and unemployment puts everyone on the street.''</p>
        <p>Town fathers are equally glum. ''Slavutich and Chernobyl are really one organism,'' says Vladimir Zhigalo, the deputy mayor. ''If you kill one part of that organism, it's very hard for the other to survive.'' Zhigalo is trying to attract new employers to Slavutich by offering potential investors free land and tax holidays, but so far there have been precious few takers. ''It's the downside of being associated with Chernobyl.''</p>
        <p>At Hospital No. 1, next to the new American-financed laboratory where Professor Smith and other American scientists are studying the genetic effects of radiation on mice, another of Chernobyl's legacies can be seen.</p>
        <p>''Over the last few years we've had an increase in kidney and thyroid cancer,'' says Dr. Irina Frulova, a surgeon from St. Petersburg who has been tending Slavutich's sick since 1987. There has been, she adds, an across-the-board deterioration in the health of Slavutich's citizens this past year and a ''dramatic'' decline in birthrates. The reason, however, is to a great extent economic; Slavutich no longer receives the special foods, medications and equipment once subsidized by the plant. ''It gets worse every day,'' Frulova sighs.</p>
        <p>Frulova refers her most urgent cases, the instances of children's thyroid cancer, to the National Institute of Endocrinology in Kiev. There, 19-year-old Natasha Shugala is recovering after surgery. She is one of 1,354 young people from the Chernobyl region treated for thyroid cancer thus far, though Prof. Mykola Tronko, the institute's director, warns that this number is far from a final tally because the latent period for the disease is as much as 30 years.</p>
        <p>Many of the so-called Chernobyl children are, in fact, already well into adulthood. In the recovery room next to Shugala's, blood drains from tubes protruding from the bandaged neck of a 27-year-old army officer. He was 13 when Chernobyl erupted, and, like Shugala, breathed in radioactive iodine isotopes released by the accident. The body naturally concentrates and stores iodine in the thyroid gland, and when irradiated, the toxic isotope causes a tumor-suppressing gene to malfunction, allowing cancerous growths to spread unchecked.</p>
        <p>The frustration for doctors like Tronko is that no one knows how many victims there really are. Because Ukraine cannot afford to send out medical teams into all the contaminated regions, many cases go undiagnosed until it is too late. The army officer's cancer, for instance, has spread to his neck and mouth.</p>
        <p>Shugala was more fortunate in that a mobile diagnostic ambulance donated by the Department of Energy passed through her village just north of the Exclusion Zone.</p>
        <p>''She'll be O.K.,'' says Tronko, ruffling Shugala's strawberry blond hair. ''We were able to get to her early. Please tell your readers that it was American money that saved this girl, and that we are grateful.''</p>
        <p>Igor Aniskin wants to be an engineer, like his father, Leonid. And he wants to work at a nuclear power station, like his father. He tells me this in confidence, as we flip through an encyclopedia of the physical world, his most prized possession after the Secret Service pin given to his dad by a member of Al Gore's security detail during the vice president's 1997 visit to Chernobyl.</p>
        <p>''My parents,'' he says, hitching up close to my ear, ''don't like the idea. They say I should do something else.''</p>
        <p>''You should just worry about your grades,'' reprimands Marina Aniskin good-naturedly, returning from the kitchen with a tray of cold meats. ''And stop talking nonsense.''</p>
        <p>It is my last night in Slavutich, and the Aniskins have prepared a farewell feast. There is carp that Igor and Leonid caught with their new lure, a weighted fly made entirely with hair from a goat's chin; cucumbers and tomatoes from their dacha plot; cheese from the local market; and beet salad.</p>
        <p>I know from my conversations with American and Ukrainian scientists that minute traces of radioactive cesium and strontium are almost certainly present in some, if not all, of the food grown in this region. That is just one reason why neurological, endocrinological, gastrointestinal and urinary illnesses are 15 times greater in the contaminated regions of Ukraine than in the general population.</p>
        <p>About the only item on the dinner menu that can be judged with some degree of certainty as safe is the gallon jug of Horilka vodka that Marina's spirited 61-year-old mother has brought. It is only after several of her ebullient toasts that I work up the courage to ask Leonid Aniskin the question that has been troubling me since we visited the sarcophagus together: how much radiation has he received?</p>
        <p>''Oh, I've lost count,'' he chuckles, deflecting my question with a pearly smile made all the whiter by his lifeguard's tan. ''Besides,'' he says, laughing, ''I've developed an immunity to radiation.''</p>
        <p>The silence that follows is broken by his wife. ''Tell him,'' she says in a low, quiet voice.</p>
        <p>Aniskin sips slowly from his shot glass. It is filled with cherry juice because he doesn't touch liquor, even ceremonially. A few years ago, he finally admits, one of his teeth fell out. At first he thought it was nothing, but then another fell out. And another, until he lost all but his three gold crowns.</p>
        <p>He had dentures and bridgework done on the sly, so as not to alert the medical commission at Chernobyl that rules on whether workers should be pensioned off due to radiation sickness. ''I was scared they would fire me,'' he confesses. Disability pay, when it is paid, which is usually months in arrears, is only about a fifth of the regular salary at Chernobyl, and Aniskin's job is highly coveted because it won't be phased out for at least the five years it takes to build a new sarcophagus.</p>
        <p>''Don't look so sad,'' he says, reaching out to pat me on the shoulder. ''It's really all right. I made my choice a long time ago.''</p>
