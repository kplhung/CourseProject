        <p>Amy Sara Zelson, a forensic anthropologist, and Kurt Daniels Mundorff, a child-abuse investigator, are to be married today by Rabbi Charles D. Lippman at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The bride, 31, works in Manhattan for the chief medical examiner. She graduated from Syracuse University and received a master's degree in anthropology from California State at Chico. She is the daughter of Myra Zelson and Dr. Joseph Zelson of Orange, Conn. Her father is a pediatrician in Orange, a clinical professor of pediatrics at Yale and the associate chief of pediatrics at Yale New Haven Hospital. Her mother is an agent at Harriet Cooper Associates, a real estate brokerage firm in Woodbridge, Conn.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 34, works in Queens for the New York City Children's Services Administration. He is a candidate for a master's degree in forensic psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He graduated from the University of Oregon. He is the son of Paula and Roger Mundorff of Milwaukie, Ore. His mother, who is retired, taught high school students how to care for preschool children, at the Owen Sabin Occupational Skills Center in Milwaukie. The bridegroom's father is a lawyer there.</p>
        <p>Although the couple share professional interests, it was love of the outdoors that brought them together. They met in Chico in 1998 in a class in emergency medical procedures for the wilderness.</p>
        <p>Three or four weeks into the course, a hypersensitivity developed between them, Ms. Zelson remembered. ''It made me nervous when he was walking over,'' she said. Soon, they began dating.</p>
        <p>In June last year, after they had spent a month hiking through Oregon and Washington, Mr. Mundorff presented an engagement ring to Ms. Zelson on a glacier on the slopes of Mount Rainier.</p>
        <p>''I'd been interested in rock climbing two years before I met Kurt,'' she said. ''It's exciting and challenging, and takes you to beautiful places. I'm glad I finally have a climbing partner.''</p>
