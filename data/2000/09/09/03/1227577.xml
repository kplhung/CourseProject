        <p>Governor Whitman has never surfed 40-foot waves or parachuted thousands of feet off a radio tower. At least, if she did, she never issued a press release on it.</p>
        <p>But in this era of all things extreme, the 53-year-old mother of two is about as fit -- and fitting -- a chief executive as there is when it comes to getting out on the ski slopes or mountain bike trails or basketball courts or on horseback. And getting banged up in the process.</p>
        <p>While her well-publicized injuries have undoubtedly been painful -- like the chipped finger bone and torn lip she got in a biking accident in California last weekend -- they have not hurt her politically.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, it makes her seem more real,'' said Matt Stark, 27, of Jersey City, the manager of the New Jersey Rock Gym in Fairfield, where working stiffs can loosen up and release tension by climbing a man-made boulder. ''She's going out having a good time. She's not sitting in her office stressed out, worrying about what bills are floating around in front of her nose. It's nice to know that she can kick back and relax.''</p>
        <p>The governor was trying to get in some last-minute fun while on vacation in California's Napa Valley last Sunday before flying back to New Jersey, when she was riding a rented mountain bike down a steep paved road. As she told a group of reporters on Monday at the State House, who could not help but notice the cast on her right middle finger and the six stitches in her upper lip, she was trying to stay ahead of a driver who was bearing down on her on the single-lane road when she went off the road's edge.</p>
        <p>With that, Mrs. Whitman did what Generation X refers to as a face plant on the hard ground. The blood-and-guts governor said she got right back up and pedaled to the rental shop to return the bike, got stitched up and caught her flight.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to get that last ride in before getting on the plane,'' Mrs. Whitman told reporters. ''If you don't bring back some real blood, it's not a real vacation.''</p>
        <p>Apparently so.</p>
        <p>While in Davos, Switzerland, with the likes of Bill Gates and Bill Clinton in 1999 for the annual World Economic Forum, Mrs. Whitman broke her leg when she took some time to hit the ski slopes. But the governor was back at work soon afterward with metal pins in her leg.</p>
        <p>There was also her rotator cuff surgery in 1996. After a year of physical therapy, the governor was still missing the plate with her curveball, and her fastball had lost a lot of its movement and velocity. Or maybe it was simply that her right shoulder was in pain. In any event, she ultimately resorted to surgery to repair the rotator cuff in her right shoulder, an operation much more common among people who sign their name on baseballs than on legislation.</p>
        <p>Eager to get back in the game, the governor left the hospital an hour after the procedure.</p>
        <p>And perhaps like so many backroom deals in the name of open space or income tax cuts, there may be countless scrapes and bruises that have never come under public scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Laura Otterbourg, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Whitman, said the governor had been active all her life, whether riding horses while growing up in Somerset County or playing basketball with her State Police bodyguards. Ms. Otterbourg said the governor did not believe she was taking unreasonable risks with her health, safety or the stewardship of the state.</p>
        <p>To try to glean any insight into the governor's political behavior through the lens of her athletic pursuits -- could her bold 1993 campaign pledge to cut income taxes 30 percent and her high-speed Napa Valley descent be rooted in the same compulsion to take risks? -- is to indulge in so much psychobabble, Ms. Otterbourg insisted.</p>
        <p>''I believe she is a good role model for residents of all ages from New Jersey, and none of her injuries have ever kept her from doing her job,'' she said. ''She's always been physically active, whether it's horseback riding, bike riding, hiking, working on the farm. She wouldn't say she's a risk taker, she's physically active. She makes well thought-out decisions and being physically active has nothing to do with this process.''</p>
        <p>Whatever it may relate to, her physical activity is far from unique among elected officials. Athleticism and physical fitness has long been a valued part of a politician's image, and officials from John F. Kennedy to Franklin D. Roosevelt have gone to great lengths to conceal their frailties.</p>
        <p>Among current governors with a sporting image, 47-year-old Gary Johnson of New Mexico was the first chief executive to compete in Hawaii's Ironman Triathlon, according to the National Governors Association. Gov. Pedro Rossello of Puerto Rico, 56, is an avid tennis player who has won five men's singles championships on the island. Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, is, naturally, a skier. And Gov. Jesse ''The Body'' Ventura of Minneota was a professional wrestler for 11 years.</p>
        <p>Closer to home, the two Republicans most likely to vie for Mrs. Whitman's seat next year -- Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco and Assembly Speaker Jack Collins -- are both avid golfers (How about a sudden-death playoff instead of a primary?).</p>
        <p>James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, agreed with Mr. Stark, the gym manager, that Mrs. Whitman's athleticism is most likely good for her image.</p>
        <p>''Her sports activities and the like probably really helped to humanize her, because she does come from a wealthy background in the Somerset hills, so the fact that she can fall off a bike or injure herself playing basketball with state troopers or have a skiing accident, probably humanizes her,'' said Professor Hughes, himself a jogger. ''It probably resonates well with other maturing baby boomers who at this stage in their life are experiencing similar mishaps.''</p>
        <p>As for when the governor would climb back on a mountain bike, Ms. Otterbourg said: ''I would imagine soon. She loves bike riding, and it's not going to keep her off.''</p>
