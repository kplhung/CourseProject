        <p>With Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario by her side, 43-year-old Martina Navratilova was putting away the young tandem of Jennifer Capriati and Anna Kournikova last night when she realized her skills have not left her, just her memory.</p>
        <p>Down by 0-30 on her serve in the fourth game of the second set, Navratilova discovered why the ball suddenly looked so blurry. During the changeover, just after taking a 3-0 lead, Navratilova stuck her glasses in her duffel bag.</p>

        <p>With Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario by her side, 43-year-old Martina Navratilova was putting away the young tandem of Jennifer Capriati and Anna Kournikova last night when she realized her skills have not left her, just her memory.</p>
        <p>Down by 0-30 on her serve in the fourth game of the second set, Navratilova discovered why the ball suddenly looked so blurry. During the changeover, just after taking a 3-0 lead, Navratilova stuck her glasses in her duffel bag.</p>
        <p>A little embarrassed, Navratilova walked over to her chair and grabbed the glasses for her next serve. A sympathetic crowd gave her an ovation as she laughed and shrugged.</p>
        <p>Navratilova quickly recovered, and she and Sanchez-Vicario ran off four straight points to take the game. They then won the second-round doubles match, 7-5, 6-0. The 19-year-old Kournikova and 24-year-old Capriati never stood a chance.</p>
