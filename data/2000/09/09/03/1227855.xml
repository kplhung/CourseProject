        <p>Late yesterday morning, Jelena Dokic found herself losing, 4-1, in the first set to Francesca Schiavone. The 17-year-old Dokic looked to the family seats in Louis Armstrong Stadium for encouragement, out of habit, and when no one was there, she had to look inside, again out of habit.</p>
        <p>''You feel like you're lonely out there,'' Dokic said. ''You've got to get that from yourself, inside. It's hard to do that. Sometimes you've got to really believe in yourself and not a lot of people can do that.''</p>

        <p>Late yesterday morning, Jelena Dokic found herself losing, 4-1, in the first set to Francesca Schiavone. The 17-year-old Dokic looked to the family seats in Louis Armstrong Stadium for encouragement, out of habit, and when no one was there, she had to look inside, again out of habit.</p>
        <p>''You feel like you're lonely out there,'' Dokic said. ''You've got to get that from yourself, inside. It's hard to do that. Sometimes you've got to really believe in yourself and not a lot of people can do that.''</p>
        <p>Dokic has had to rely on herself since her father, Damir, was ejected from the United States Open on Wednesday following a confrontation that began over the price of salmon in the players' cafeteria. Damir Dokic has not tried to enter the National Tennis Center grounds since he was banned.</p>
        <p>Without his guidance yesterday, Dokic recovered to win the first set in a tie breaker, then came back from a 5-4 deficit in the second to win the third-round match, 7-6 (4), 7-5.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, the pressure was on me to win the match; I was expected to win,'' said Dokic, who is ranked No. 43 while Schiavone is ranked 108th. ''When you lose a few points and get down a break, you get a bit tight. You won't always be up. You're going to have to make comebacks.''</p>
        <p>Dokic now faces her most difficult challenge when she meets Serena Williams in the fourth round. In May, she beat Venus Williams, 6-1, 6-2, in Rome. ''I think it would be big for anybody to beat Serena or Venus,'' Dokic said. ''They're probably the two players at the moment that are just unbeatable.''</p>
        <p>Too Darn Hot</p>
        <p>The blistering sun and humidity withered seventh-seeded Conchita Martinez, who lost to Yelena Dementieva, 6-4, 6-1. After the match, Martinez was treated for what was called a heat-related illness that caused leg cramps.</p>
        <p>Martinez said the heat contributed to her sluggishness. ''I felt extremely flat today,'' she said. ''The problem was with my legs; they weren't working at all and they felt dead.''</p>
        <p>She said she had been battling a respiratory condition for 10 days.</p>
        <p>Hicham Arazi was also affected by the heat. He had to retire after the first game of the fifth set against Arnaud Clement. Arazi had severe cramping in the left side of his body. Clement, who ousted Andre Agassi in his previous match, advanced, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 4-6, 0-1.</p>
        <p>A Quiet Retirement</p>
        <p>After a record 61 doubles titles together, Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge, the top-seeded doubles team at the Open, ended their Grand Slam pairing with a whimper. Woodbridge double-faulted in the third-set tie breaker and with that, sent his partner, and the team, into Grand Slam retirement.</p>
        <p>Lleyton Hewitt and Max Mirnyi defeated Woodforde and Woodbridge, 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (4). ''Yes, that's disappointing because we did well to get back into the match,'' Woodbridge said. ''But, you know, we've played a million matches together, a thousand matches or something.''</p>
        <p>The Woodies, as they are known, plan to play in the Olympics in their native Australia in two weeks, and following the men's season, Woodforde, who turns 35 this month, will retire. Woodbridge, 29, will continue to play.</p>
        <p>''The Woodies, that name, us, we're certainly one of the -- hopefully I can finally say it -- one of the greatest teams out there that have played,'' Woodforde said.</p>
        <p>The Woodies won eight doubles titles this year and two Grand Slam titles, at the French Open and Wimbledon. They won the 1995 and 1996 United States Opens and were just one short of tying the 12 Grand Slam doubles titles of John Newcombe and Tony Roche.</p>
        <p>They had no tears yesterday, a few sighs at ending their Grand Slam career before tying the record, but they reflected without much emotion.</p>
        <p>''I got the most out of myself and I think we've got the most out of each other,'' Woodforde said. ''Maybe a few of the other guys are probably breathing a sigh of relief now that we're out of this tournament, that we're not going to be around too much longer.''</p>
