        <p>In the shadow of the culinary dogma that dominates how we eat, a revolution is springing up. Little food -- small dishes meant for nibbling -- is starting to threaten, even usurp, the traditional order of courses.</p>
        <p>Little food is partly a response to a life that conspires against monolithic effort. A variety of dishes that can be prepared in advance and laid out with minimal fuss eases the trade-off between limited time and an undiminished desire to entertain.</p>
        <p>Miniature meals tend to require more of a knack for culinary collage -- combining the hand-wrought with the store-bought -- than they do a commitment to kitchen Olympics. After all, little meals began as a way to minimize food preparation in order to maximize the time spent eating or, perhaps more to the point, drinking. In most cultures, little food sprouted as libation's consort.</p>
        <p>Only recently has little food risen as a solution to little time. But risen it has, as dinner parties are built around dozens of sturdy, well-tried traditions -- antipasti, smorgasbord, Andalusian tapas, mezze from the eastern Mediterranean or an assortment of Indian chat. Customs differ by nationality, of course. Tapas, like Cantonese dim sum, Brazilian salgadinhos and even Japanese sushi, were little dishes meant to be eaten away from home. French canapes, like the Russian vodka accompaniment zakuska, were meant to be eaten at home, before dinner.</p>
        <p>The two traditions -- little meals as a precursor to a meal at home and little meals designed for public consumption -- converged at the American cocktail party, a convention born when Prohibition sent drinking people home. There, writes James Beard in ''American Cookery,'' the decline of entertaining with servants, coupled with a casual, livelier tempo, yielded ''finger food.''</p>
        <p>Initially nothing more than a cushion for alcohol, finger food is now being reinvented in portions more reminiscent of an entire hand than a single digit and in flavors bold enough to withstand the taste-numbing effects of cocktails. This is made easier by dint of the fact that there are so many ethnic traditions to draw from when designing bite-size meals. The key is establishing enough of a harmony among the various dishes to create a coherent whole. Be imaginative, be adventuresome, but beware of clashing cuisines.</p>
        <p>Shrinking time has spurred cooks to streamline. The hors d'oeuvre that eclipsed the soup course in the postwar era is now becoming the meal. En famille has come to mean one-pot cooking. Company meals, on the other hand, are often the sum of many little dishes, an eat-what-and-when-you-want sort of affair.</p>
        <p>Unlike its salon and cocktail-party predecessors, modern little food is sit-down, not stand-up, fare. Unencumbered by big culinary statements, people emerge, towering over little food, as the true reason for parties.</p>
        <p>Figs With Duck Prosciutto and Sorrel  2 teaspoons honey  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  5 ounces duck prosciutto, cut thinly into 4-inch-long slices (see note)  12 sorrel leaves, stacked, sliced in half lengthwise  12 ripe figs, halved lengthwise.</p>
        <p>1. In a small bowl, whisk together the honey and mustard.</p>
        <p>2. On a work surface, lay out the prosciutto slices and top each with a sorrel strip. Using a pastry brush, coat each lightly with some of the honey mustard. Place a fig, rounded side down, in the middle of each strip and wrap the prosciutto and sorrel around it. Push a toothpick from the base of each parcel through the top, pinning together the overlapping prosciutto and sorrel. Transfer to a serving platter and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: Available by mail order from D'Artagnan, (800) 327-8246.</p>
        <p>Tomato Pudding in Cherry-Tomato Cups  36 large red cherry tomatoes  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  10 plum tomatoes, cored  6 ounces cream cheese  36 1 1/2-inch chive segments.</p>
        <p>1. Using a paring knife, remove and discard a thin slice from the tops and a very thin slice from the bottoms of the cherry tomatoes. With a small melon baller, scoop out and discard the seeds and pulp. Sprinkle the insides with salt and pepper and invert on a paper-towel-lined plate. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. In a blender, add the plum tomatoes and puree until smooth. Transfer to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil until reduced by 1/3 and very thick, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plastic-wrap-lined baking sheet and store in the refrigerator until cold.</p>
        <p>3. Push the puree through a fine-mesh sieve to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids. Transfer to a food processor and add the cream cheese. Pulse until smooth. Season with salt.</p>
        <p>4. On a work surface, stand the cherry tomatoes on their bottoms. Using a teaspoon, fill each with the cream cheese mixture, mounding it slightly on top. With a damp paper towel, remove any smudges. Gently press 1 chive segment onto each mound. Transfer to a platter and chill until ready to serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 servings.</p>
        <p>Corn-and-Country-Ham Madeleines  1 teaspoon vegetable oil, plus more for the pan  2 ounces country ham, like Smithfield, finely chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 cup corn kernels (from 1 ear corn)  1 clove garlic, peeled and finely chopped  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, plus  1/2 teaspoon salt  1 1/2 cups yellow cornmeal</p>
        <p>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/4 cup granulated sugar  2 teaspoons baking powder  1 cup whole milk  2 large eggs, beaten</p>
        <p>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted  Chili powder for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. In a skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil. Add the ham, corn and garlic and stir until hot, about 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat and cool.</p>
        <p>2. Sift the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder and  1/2teaspoon salt into a large bowl. Stir in the milk, eggs and butter until a smooth batter is formed. Stir in the ham mixture. Spoon half of the batter into each of the 12 scalloped cups of a greased madeleine pan and smooth the tops. Place in the oven and bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 15 minutes. Invert onto a cooling rack. Sprinkle lightly with salt and chili powder. Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve warm. (Reheat the madeleines briefly in a 350-degree oven if necessary.)</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 servings.</p>
        <p>Seared Sea Scallop Saganaki With Feta (Adapted from Molyvos restaurant, New York)  6 plum tomatoes, halved lengthwise</p>
        <p>1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon olive oil  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  6 sprigs oregano  4 sprigs rosemary  6 cloves garlic, peeled and mashed, plus 2 cloves, peeled and thinly sliced  12 large sea scallops  1 cup white wine  2 cups homemade or low-sodium canned chicken broth  Juice of 2 lemons  Green ends from 2 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  2 tablespoons coarsely chopped parsley, plus 12 sprigs for garnish  2 tablespoons coarsely chopped dill  5 ounces feta cheese, crumbled.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium nonreactive bowl, toss the tomatoes with  1/4 cup of the oil. Drain off the excess oil and reserve. Place the tomatoes, cut side up, on a parchment-paper-lined baking sheet spaced well apart. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bake until almost dried, about 1 1/2 hours.</p>
        <p>2. Remove the tomatoes from the oven and transfer to a shallow dish, cut side up. Arrange the oregano, rosemary and mashed garlic over the tomatoes. Drizzle with the reserved oil from the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside to marinate at room temperature for 3 hours.</p>
        <p>3. In a large skillet over high heat, heat  1/4 cup of the oil. Season the scallops with salt and pepper, place in the skillet and cook, turning once, until well browned and slightly firm to the touch, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. Discard the oil, wipe out the skillet and return to the heat. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, add the thinly sliced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the wine and cook until reduced by half, about 2 1/2 minutes. Add the broth, bring to a boil and cook until reduced to  3/4cup, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice, scallions, mustard, chopped parsley and dill.</p>
        <p>4. Remove the herb sprigs from the tomatoes and discard. Divide the tomatoes among 12 small bowls. Top each tomato half with a scallop, spoon some sauce over, sprinkle with feta, garnish with the parsley sprigs and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 servings.</p>
        <p>Cup o' Crab Ceviche  12 plum tomatoes, cored and coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil  7 tablespoons lime juice  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  6 ounces jumbo lump crabmeat, shell and cartilage fragments discarded  2 tablespoons finely sliced cilantro leaves  12 thin lime wedges.</p>
        <p>1. In a blender, combine the tomatoes and jalapeno and puree until smooth. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve; discard the solids. Stir in the sesame oil and 4 tablespoons of the lime juice and season with salt and pepper. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.</p>
        <p>2. In a medium bowl, toss together the remaining 3 tablespoons lime juice, the crab and the cilantro and season with salt and pepper. Divide the mixture into 12 small balls.</p>
        <p>3. Line up 12 chilled 5-ounce juice glasses. Pour  1/4 cup of the tomato liquid into each glass. Using tongs, gently drop a crab ball into each glass, hang a lime wedge over each rim and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 servings.</p>
