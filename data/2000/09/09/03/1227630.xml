        <p>Provident Savings Bank, a Jersey City-based mutual savings bank founded in 1839, last week bought the 115-year-old Ridgewood Savings Bank of New Jersey, in a deal valued at $22.4 million.</p>
        <p>Provident Savings, New Jersey's oldest and largest mutual savings bank, now has 51 branches in New Jersey and $2.7 billion in assets. The four Ridgewood Savings Bank branches in Ridgewood and Mahwah will give Provident a strong presence in Bergen County that it did not have before, said Kevin J. Ward, executive vice president, chief operating officer and chief financial officer of Provident. The Ridgewood banks are operated by Ridgewood Financial Inc. and will continue to use the Ridgewood name.</p>

        <p>Ridgewood shareholders received $15 per share for their stock in the bank. Depositors will receive the same benefits granted to depositors at Provident, which is, in effect, owned by the depositors rather than shareholders. The deal is subject to regulatory and Ridgewood shareholder approvals.</p>
