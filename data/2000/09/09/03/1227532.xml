        <p>Out of the financial district's monochromatic canyons, an astonishing quiltwork of color has emerged in the last month as the facade of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York undergoes its first cleaning in 76 years.</p>
        <p>What was a drably dun-colored expanse below the second-floor balustrade now seems almost to burble. Pillowy rusticated blocks of khaki-colored limestone alternate randomly with Ohio sandstone in a luscious variety of hues: wheat, honey, amber, olive and burgundy. Russet-colored veins in the sandstone blocks are visible for the first time in generations, as the dark carbon blanket is rinsed away by a mixture of water and finely ground glass.</p>

        <p>Out of the financial district's monochromatic canyons, an astonishing quiltwork of color has emerged in the last month as the facade of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York undergoes its first cleaning in 76 years.</p>
        <p>What was a drably dun-colored expanse below the second-floor balustrade now seems almost to burble. Pillowy rusticated blocks of khaki-colored limestone alternate randomly with Ohio sandstone in a luscious variety of hues: wheat, honey, amber, olive and burgundy. Russet-colored veins in the sandstone blocks are visible for the first time in generations, as the dark carbon blanket is rinsed away by a mixture of water and finely ground glass.</p>
        <p>Some areas of the facade have been less affected by pollution than others, depending on their exposure to exhaust from traffic and on the microclimate around the building: sunlight, wind direction and rainfall patterns. But the cleaning clearly reveals the checkerboard palette used by the architects York &amp; Sawyer in designing the 14-story structure, which takes up the trapezoidal block bounded by Liberty, Nassau and William Streets and Maiden Lane. It once again evokes the Florentine palazzi on which it was modeled.</p>
        <p>Aesthetics, however, were not the only thing motivating the Fed. The cleaning, which is to be finished next year, permits a close-up inspection of every stone as part of an overall $100 million, 10-  to 15-year renovation and modernization of the landmark building, inside and out. The architects are Beyer Blinder Belle, the construction manager is the Turner Corporation and the cleaning subcontractor is Nicholson &amp; Galloway.</p>
        <p>By next year, the Fed will have compiled a stone-by-stone census of the facade, said Joseph Oszacki, the senior facilities engineer.</p>
        <p>So far, the cleaning has revealed fissures, nicks and patches, but little serious damage. ''By and large, the stones seem to be in really great shape,'' said Israel Sendrovic, an executive vice president of the Fed, who is overseeing the renovation.</p>
        <p>''The reason I suspect my predecessors didn't think of cleaning the building is that limestone and sandstone don't interact that great,'' Mr. Sendrovic said. ''If you have something that could clean limestone, it would do damage to sandstone. And to try cleaning the building one stone at a time, protecting the stones around it, is a bit silly.''</p>
        <p>One of the original suppliers, the Briar Hill Company of Glenmont, Ohio, founded in 1917, is still in business, operating seven sandstone quarries from which come burgundies, buffs, a ''sunset blush'' and the company's signature, ''copper variegated,'' a dark umber with pronounced veining.</p>
        <p>Briar Hill sandstone was used in York &amp; Sawyer's Bowery Savings Bank, 110 East 42nd Street, completed in 1923, and on the Yale University campus.</p>
        <p>When freshly quarried, the stone color is so vivid that customers sometimes think it is too striking, said Ed Gales, the company's national sales manager. ''Give it some time,'' he counsels.</p>
