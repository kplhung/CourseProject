        <p>The slingshot serve from the hulking Mark Philippoussis crashed into the top of the net, ricocheting into the air on a flight as unpredictable as paper airplane's.

        <p>The slingshot serve from the hulking Mark Philippoussis crashed into the top of the net, ricocheting into the air on a flight as unpredictable as paper airplane's. But with whipsaw reflexes, and a little luck, a wide-eyed Jan-Michael Gambill managed to leapfrog the wayward serve as it headed toward his body on the fly.</p>
        <p>Disaster averted. The ball bounced, and the Aussie's double fault on break point set up Gambill to serve out the final second-round match of the United States Open. But first, there was the changeover, and time to ponder the moment while a rowdy crowd chanted for the American at Louis Armstrong Stadium yesterday. And yet, as Gambill sat in his chair, he had the detached stare of a subway passenger.</p>
        <p>''If you saw my face, I hope that I betrayed no emotion,'' Gambill said. ''Logically, for me to go out there and be too emotional isn't how I win.''</p>
        <p>This is how he won. He stayed as cool as Frigidaire in the suffocating heat that coated the grounds on Day 6 of the Open. And only after he calmly finished off a puzzled Philippoussis, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4, did he allow himself to punch his fist into the air.</p>
        <p>At this moment, Gambill was more than one of the beautiful people, more than the telegenic player with the Ford Modeling contract, more than the tanned pinup from Spokane, Wash. Beneath the surface, he revealed the serious substance of his game.</p>
        <p>Inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, the Anna-obsessed were still searching for that revelation. Instead, they found heartbreak, but also discovered the budding talent of Justine Henin as she zipped 26 winners by the unsteady and 12th-seeded Anna Kournikova, 6-4, 7-6 (5).</p>
        <p>''She likes her look, everybody likes her look,'' said Henin, an 18-year-old Belgian ranked 58th on the tour. ''But I am not here to do cinema. I am here to play tennis, and I think that's the best important.''</p>
        <p>There is a suspicion that Kournikova's priorities are disorganized, at best. While the photo shoots and appearances related to her multimillion-dollar endorsement deals have made her wealthy, the distractions appear to disrupt the attention to her game.</p>
        <p>''I don't have any outside interests,'' a typically testy Kournikova said. ''I just have to go back out there and work on my consistency.''</p>
        <p>Right now, her mental state on big points is shaky, and her tentative serve has yet to improve in recent years. And yet, the paparazzi, the networks and the public cannot get enough of Kournikova.</p>
        <p>While Kournikova was featured inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, second-seeded Lindsay Davenport was taking care of Tamarine Tanasugarn,  6-2, 6-1, in Louis Armstrong Stadium. Also moving to the Round of 16, fifth-seeded Serena Williams won in straight sets, and fourth-seeded Mary Pierce regrouped after trailing by 4-1 in the second set to get by Lisa Raymond. Less than two weeks removed from losing her arbitration bid to be named to the United States Olympic team, a drained Raymond managed to unearth a performance that almost unnerved Pierce.</p>
        <p>''I think I did a really good job of putting everything behind me,'' said Raymond, who is ranked 26th in singles. ''If you can't get up for a Grand Slam, you can't get up for anything. I realized it was a Grand Slam, and I said, 'Let's go.' ''</p>
        <p>She just didn't have enough oomph to get by Pierce. It was difficult for players to dig deep in such heat. Still, there was energy, particularly emanating from the cozy confines of Court 10. At match point, a roar was heard around the grounds when the qualifier Hyung-Taik Lee stunned Rainer Schuttler, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.</p>
        <p>The victory for Lee, who is only the third Korean to play in a Grand Slam tournament since the open era began in 1968, left tennis officials scrambling for a translator. As Lee drew closer to victory, there was even a call sent out to the United Nations to find someone to relate Lee's remarkable story. Finally, someone emerged from the Korean press.</p>
        <p>''He says that he's a country boy,'' Lee's interpreter said. ''He's from a small town.''</p>
        <p>The quaint story could end soon. Lee plays Pete Sampras in the Round of 16. But what lies ahead for Sampras? In his half of the draw, top-seeded Andre Agassi was upset on Thursday, then fifth-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov was shockingly dismissed in straight sets by Dominik Hrbaty yesterday. If Sampras can navigate through potential upsets, he could face another American.</p>
        <p>The unseeded Gambill? It is possible. In his half of the draw, second-seeded Gustavo Kuerten is gone, and there is no clear-cut favorite. Gambill put his name in that hat by combating Philippoussis' power on the hardcourt with his own.</p>
        <p>''I think the quick court favors me just as much,'' said Gambill, who served 17 aces to the 16 for Philippoussis. ''I hit my ground strokes just as much as he does. He's hitting his serve maybe 5, 7 or 10 miles faster than me some of the time, but most of the time, I'm hitting as many aces as he is.''</p>
        <p>The wiry Gambill has begun to live up to the billing as the Next Great American. It has taken some time, but the 23-year-old is making progress up the ranking. He ended 1999 ranked 58th but has risen to No. 27. And this rise is why he made what he called one of the most difficult decisions of his life when he declined a spot on the Olympic team.</p>
        <p>''I've been playing so many events,'' said Gambill, who has also picked up some injuries along the way. ''I need time off after the Open because I have a full schedule of seven events in the fall. I really want to make a push for the top 10; that's my goal.''</p>
        <p>The object of his career is to make a statement with his tennis, not with his camera-friendly good looks.</p>
        <p>''I would never let anything outside of tennis be a distraction,'' Gambill said a week before the start of the Open. ''My focus is on tennis, 100 percent.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Gambill proved it, while Kournikova still has some work to do.</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>RICHARD KRAJICEK of the Netherlands outlasted 11th-seeded TIM HENMAN of England, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 7-5, 7-5, in a 3-hour-24-minute match that ended early today. . . . Ninth-seeded LLEYTON HEWITT had an easy time dismissing JIRI NOVAK, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3, in the men's third round yesterday.</p>
