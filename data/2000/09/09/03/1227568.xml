        <p>A BRIGHT orange tank top, midcalf blue  jeans and sneakers  then again maybe platform sandals -- are what 16-year-old Erin Rakow plans to wear on the first day of school at Byram Hills High in Armonk.</p>
        <p>''Comfortable,'' she said. ''Not sweat pants kind of comfortable, but comfortable.''</p>
        <p>Feeling at ease in clothes does a lot for the personality, Erin said, especially on the hectic first day of school. ''Clothes can make you or break you at the social level,'' she said. ''It's so much easier to talk to people when you feel good.''</p>
        <p>Teenagers are stepping back into the hustle and bustle of classes, homework, sports and the all-important concerns of who's who, what's going on and ''Oh, my god, she cut her hair.'' Clothes, what you wouldn't be caught dead in and what you would die to have, are a key ingredient in this mix.</p>
        <p>''Well I wouldn't say clothes are soooo important,'' said Joanna Cambareri, 17, who is entering her senior year at Fox Lane High School in Mount Kisco. ''But you don't want to walk in in scrubby pants and a baggy T-shirt. You would feel bummy all day.''</p>
        <p>She and her friend, Nicole Philip, 17, also about to enter her senior year at Fox Lane, were sizing up the latest fashions in ''Out of the Blue,'' a clothing store in Mount Kisco that is popular with teenagers. Nicole, who is considering a career in the fashion industry, pulled a pair of bright leopard-print pants off the rack.</p>
        <p>''Last year a few people wore these,'' she said. ''I think they took the leopard fashion statement too far.  They were obviously trying to get attention. Maybe negative from the girls and positive from the boys.''  Joanna added, ''Sometimes negative from the guys too.'' They disappeared into the dressing room to try on the same fuzzy sweater.</p>
        <p>Later in a huddle with Sofia Redford, 14, about to enter her freshman year at Fox Lane and shopping for school clothes with her mother, Pamela, the girls commented on what the boys usually wore to school.</p>
        <p>''The boys in my class wear jeans six inches away from the legs and three sizes bigger than the right size,'' Sofia said. Nicole added: ''I think the boys' pants get less baggy as they go from year to year. Maybe it's a sign of maturity.''</p>
        <p>Joanna said she thought the boys' jeans were pretty much just right at this stage.</p>
        <p>Paul Caputo, 16, of Yonkers, who attends Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains, said he sometimes cuts the seams in his wide-leg jeans. ''I like the way it looks and it goes over sneakers better,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Boys as well as girls seem to know what clothes are with it and what are not, observed Sofia.</p>
        <p>''Like wearing sweater vests,'' she said. ''This is not exactly the best thing to do -- much too weird. But it depends how you carry it off. If you're already in, it's O.K. If not, it's weird.''</p>
        <p>Sofia held up her choice for the first day of school, a maroon T-shirt with the words ''millennium shmillennium'' in front, and checked herself out in a mirror. ''I play it low the first month or so at school and figure out what's happening,'' she said. ''Then I bring out the crazier things in my closet, like brighter colors.''</p>
        <p>What is definitely not cool is going too far with clothes, Erin said. ''You know tube tops? Well I like them O.K., but they can really look out there when you're not built for them chest-wise.''</p>
        <p>Fashion magazines, rock singers and television shows like ''Sex and the City'' point the way when it comes to fashion, Nicole said.</p>
        <p>''Sex and the City is the ultimate hip fashion,'' she said. ''I love it.''</p>
        <p>Teenagers said they rarely shop online. No fun, they say, compared with hanging out with friends and finding that must-have pair of gold hoop earrings at the mall.</p>
        <p>Nicole plans to buy several long sweaters to the knees which she has seen in stores in Manhattan, even if nobody else wears them. If the compliments come, all the better.</p>
        <p>''I was very iffy about wearing some leopard shoes last year,'' she said. ''But when people started saying, 'Oh, those are so neat,' I relaxed.''</p>
        <p>Joanna pulled out a knee-length black skirt with fringe from the racks. ''Really pretty,'' she and Nicole said together. Both agreed they would never, ever wear it to school. ''People wear long skirts occasionally,'' Joanna said, ''but they make you look too elegant and you don't want that for school.''</p>
