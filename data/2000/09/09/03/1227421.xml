        <p>LAURA</p>
        <p>By Larry Watson.</p>
        <p>Pocket Books, $24.95.</p>
        <p>Precise observation and a scrupulously sustained tone of melancholy nostalgia add appropriate gravity, if not energy, to Larry Watson's earnest fifth novel. Set in New England, the book is about one man's decades-long obsession with a mercurial writer-celebrity named Laura Coe Pettit, who is described as ''a literary enfant terrible, the sexy poet with the acid tongue.'' Paul Finley's story begins in 1955, when Laura appears, drunk, in his bedroom in the middle of the night at his parents' Vermont summer home. (At the time, Paul is all of 11.) Laura, who is a decade older, continues to bedevil the introspective Paul's eager imagination throughout most of his life -- she is not only a family friend (his father is her editor), his father's probable mistress and the presumable cause of his parents' divorce; she later becomes a prominent antiwar protester of the late 1960's. And after she has aged and secluded herself in a small Vermont town, Laura finally, and surprisingly, soothes Paul's fears that his ''heart had been dying, kept from what it needed to live.'' The novel's claustrophobic fixation on his monomania is very nearly its undoing; Laura's temperamental instability puts off the reader as surely as it fascinates Paul. Watson, whose previous novels include ''Montana 1948'' and ''Justice,'' nevertheless builds an impressively detailed, and ultimately quite moving, characterization of a cautious, introverted boy's stunted growth, and his painful transformation into an outwardly stable adult who becomes a successful pediatrician and happily married father.</p>
