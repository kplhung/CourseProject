        <p>SMITH-Gerald Morton. On September 1. Born January 17, 1918, to Samuel Jacob Smith and Sarah Zaslavsky, in Fall River, Mass. He grew up in Webster, Mass., was an accomplished orator and actor in high school, studied international relations at Harvard College ('39, cum laude) and later received his J.D. from Harvard Law School ('42). In World War II, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps and became a pilot and aide to General Tom Hardin, flying the ''Hump'' from India over the Himalayas to China. At war's end, he worked briefly for Taca Airlines in South America and was a government aviation administrator in Washington before settling in New York and pursuing a career in surety law. He retired in 1986 a partner in the insurance specialty firm then known as Gottesman, Wolgel, Smith &amp; Secunda. While at the firm, he acted as an arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association. A devoted husband, a warm and playful parent, a dedicated fisherman, he was always a gentleman, generous and loyal, with an absurdist sense of humor. He was also a fierce believer in truth and right and an inspiration to excellence in all who knew him. He is survived by his adoring wife of 46 years, the former Lorraine Ina Waldman, and by sons Mark Storey Smith and Carlton Malben Smith, in whom his sense of fun &amp; wonder live on; also by his devoted sister Eleanor Mailman, daughter-in-law Mina Mostafazadeh-Asl Smith, grandchildren Larissa Roxanna Smith and Talia Sara Smith and a wide web of friends and family for whom his passing leaves the world a lesser place.</p>
