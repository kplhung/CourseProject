        <p>GORE VIDAL wrote ''The Best Man'' in 1959, a time when Joseph McCarthy's legacy endured, when Adlai Stevenson and Richard Nixon were among the nation's leading politicians, and when Mr. Vidal counted as his friend a young senator from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy. The play, first produced on Broadway in March 1960, eight months before Kennedy was elected president, drew on these influences to become a tale of politics that may seem improbable today: a stark struggle of two men of obvious complexity, set during a national political convention where decisions of consequence were actually made.</p>
        <p>''The Best Man'' is returning to Broadway 10 presidential campaigns since it first arrived to favorable reviews. Previews begin on Tuesday at the Virginia Theater, where it opens on Sept. 17 with a cast that includes Charles Durning, Spalding Gray, Chris Noth, Elizabeth Ashley, Christine Ebersole and Michael Learned, under the direction of Ethan McSweeny.</p>
        <p>The play is dated, yet it is not, and in that, it is very much like the 74-year-old Mr. Vidal himself. Politics have changed mightily since 1959, and the play and its author are a reminder that much of what once so invigorated the nation's presidential selection process -- the suspense, the unvarnished characters, the sense that something meaningful was at stake -- has seeped away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal attended his first convention at the age of 14, yet he did not even consider stopping by when the Democrats met in Los Angeles to nominate Al Gore last month, even though he was 25 minutes away by car, settled in at a rooftop suite with a private garden at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ''It's too dismal,'' Mr. Vidal said, the morning after President Clinton gave his valedictory speech to the assembled Democrats. ''I'm not interested in any of the candidates.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Vidal has not, it seems, lost enthusiasm for what was probably his best-received play, nor has he made any changes in the original script to account for the intervening 40 years. Now formally retitled ''Gore Vidal's The Best Man,'' to avoid confusion with an unrelated movie called ''The Best Man'' that was released last fall, the drama abounds with themes and lines that are at times strikingly contemporary, notwithstanding the fact that they were written before many of the current crop of politicians were old enough to vote.</p>
        <p>''We've had some very good presidents who have slept around a lot more than Bill Russell ever did, and in the White House, too,'' proclaims the frumpy national committeewoman Mrs. Gamadge (played by Ms. Ashley), as she comes to the defense of a candidate with an exemplary public life and a marriage more complicated than that of the couple now living in the White House. As Russell (Mr. Gray) finds himself drawn into the back alleys of political combat, he laments that he entered public life to put an end to ''the business of gossip instead of issues, personalities instead of policies.''</p>
        <p>Besides the two candidates, who are out to destroy each other, there is a departing president (Mr. Durning), who makes a case for the honorability of lying to the electorate, be it about his terminal medical diagnosis or the fact that he does not believe in God. Most fundamentally, though, Mr. Vidal presents a struggle between two types of politicians who are as common today as they were then: the ruthless, relentless yet effective Senator Joe Cantwell (Mr. Noth), and the honorable, morally grounded yet maddeningly deliberate Bill Russell.</p>
        <p>This was Nixon versus Stevenson in its time, the inspiration for the competing politicians in the play, but there is no shortage of present-day analogies. ''There are only so many types who are drawn to politics,'' Mr. Vidal observed. And the questions he raises in setting up the combat between his politicians are the same ones that Bill Bradley's dispirited supporters were asking themselves in New Hampshire as Al Gore cheerfully pummeled their candidate into defeat: Who would make the better candidate for office? And who would make the better president?</p>
        <p>''I don't have an answer and I never will,'' Mr. Vidal said last month in Los Angeles, poking at a slab of seared salmon and drinking iced coffee in the dining room of the Beverly Wilshire, which was teeming with Democratic delegates who, to his constant distraction, had taken to chanting ''Gore!'' as they marched through the hotel corridors.</p>
        <p>''I'm dealing with game players,'' Mr. Vidal continued. ''These are chess games. And I'm not going to analyze the chess player. I'm going to analyze the game.'' (That said, Mr. Vidal has never attempted to hide his empathy for Stevenson. So it is not surprising that Russell comes across as more noble by the play's end.)</p>
        <p>The game, as Mr. Vidal would have it, involves the struggle between Russell and Cantwell to win their party's presidential nomination, played out in two hotel suites in Philadelphia in July 1960, as the convention unfolds around them. Each man has dug up information that could likely doom the other's candidacy. Russell is mortified at his own behavior when, exhorted by his lieutenants and the president, he confronts Cantwell with what he has discovered. ''I never thought I could bring up something like this against any man,'' Russell says. ''It revolts me.'' It falls to Cantwell to buck up Russell. ''Oh, come on -- don't give it a second thought,'' he says. ''Look, I don't blame you. I'd certainly use it against you if it was there.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, the story line would be unimaginable today for obvious reasons. '' 'The Best Man' is based on the idea that candidates have secrets,'' said Jeffrey Richards, one of the play's producers and its press representative. ''Today, who has secrets on the eve of the convention?''</p>
        <p>In its way, then, the play is a time capsule, a means to measure how much the system has changed. Even the undercurrent of homosexuality, which Mr. Vidal noted was ''scandalous'' in its time (though certainly not a surprising theme for one of the nation's first openly gay writers), seems almost quaint in these days of Richard Hatch and television's ''Survivor.''</p>
        <p>Even though Mr. Vidal did not alter the script, he would not approach the subject the same way now. ''If I were to do a political play today about who governs the United States, it would not be set at a political convention,'' Mr. Vidal said. ''It would be within a board room, as they argue about politicians, and audition politicians, and figure out which one they're going to make president.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of his drama in light of the present period, he said: ''I don't see how you can begin to do a play that's constructed like that -- which is really a dramatic contest between two front-runners. And it can go either way. That doesn't happen anymore. Primaries meant something then, but nobody knew in March who the candidate was going to be -- which we knew in both parties this year. It's predicted by how much money is spent in the primary season and it's quickly wrapped up. So there's nothing to do at a convention but pick a vice president. Generally undramatic, if that.''</p>
        <p>It is no coincidence that ''The Best Man'' is being revived this season. Mr. Richards said he had had it in mind for a play-reading project that did not pan out, but still thought ''it would be great to do in a year in which there was a presidential campaign.''</p>
        <p>When he subsequently contacted Mr. Vidal in Italy, Mr. Richards recalled, ''His initial questions were: 'Are you really serious about this?' And, 'Do you want me to update it?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richards said he put ''The Best Man'' in the category of ''classic popular entertainment''; ''I wouldn't update 'The Front Page' or 'The Little Foxes.' '' At the same time, though, there have been few attempts by any writers over the last 40 years to make politics the subject of a Broadway play (Mr. Vidal tried once or twice after ''The Best Man'' without much success), and it will be intriguing to see if there is more interest in theatrical treatments of politics than in the game itself. (The 1964 movie version of ''The Best Man,'' for which Mr. Vidal wrote the screenplay, starred Henry Fonda.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal is not just another playwright, or historical novelist, or essayist, or commentator, or whichever of the many resume entries he might use to define himself. He has practiced what he is writing about: he ran for Congress from New York in 1960, and for senator from California in 1982, each time as a Democrat; he lost both elections. And while in Los Angeles last month, he was a keynote speaker at a forum sponsored by The Nation, an ideological retreat for Democrats frustrated by the proceedings downtown.</p>
        <p>THE speech he gave warned that the drive to increase the country's military might was a threat to the economic viability of the Republic at a time when the nation is anxious for peace and suspicious of interventionism (much as Mr. Gore's grandfather was when he served as a senator from Oklahoma).</p>
        <p>''It was quite something,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Not only a standing ovation, but they began to chant, 'Go, Gore! Go, Gore! Go, Gore!' They were running me for president!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal is also unusual in that over the years he has kept some notable company. He and Jacqueline Bouvier shared the same stepfather, Hugh D. Auchincloss, at different times, and his conversation is scattered with first-name references to former presidents and first ladies, complete with anecdotes about, and caricatures of, the people he has known.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't remind me of Mr. Truman at all,'' Mr. Vidal declared in a husky falsetto, as he recounted what Eleanor Roosevelt told him when she was asked her opinion of the president in ''The Best Man.''</p>
        <p>As the playwright sat in on a rehearsal the other day in Manhattan, wearing sunglasses and drinking a Diet Coke while the actors competed over the thump of construction machinery outside, he leaned over to offer a real-time footnote to his play. ''The next line is one Jack Kennedy gave me,'' he said. He turned to the makeshift ''stage,'' an assortment of couches, tables and empty Absolut bottles, where one of Russell's supporters proceeded to promise him that he was behind his candidacy ''100 percent.'' That means, then and now, that ''you're finished,'' Mr. Vidal said tartly.</p>
        <p>President Kennedy attended a performance of ''The Best Man'' on Broadway, with Charles Spalding, a longtime friend, at his side. Mr. Vidal stood behind a curtain in the wings, observing the president as the president observed his play. ''I had never actually watched anybody who was watching a play,'' Mr. Vidal said. ''I could see their eyes, so I could see who they were looking at. He was following it very attentively. And there was a little giggle between him and Spalding on the line about how to get girls in the White House.''</p>
        <p>''And then he did his famous'' -- Mr. Vidal brought his fingers to his mouth and tapped his teeth, evoking a dozen pictures of Mr. Kennedy -- ''which meant he was thinking, he was really following it.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, another man who would be president, Ronald Reagan, came close to playing Russell on Broadway. Mr. Vidal rejected that casting suggestion from the producers, and the part went to Melvyn Douglas. ''I'm responsible for Ronald Reagan,'' Mr. Vidal whispered, as the rehearsal continued. ''I turned him down for the part. They came to me and said, 'What about Ronald Reagan?' I said, 'He is good, but I don't think he'd be credible as a presidential candidate.' I have always thought that if I had cast him, Melvyn Douglas would have become president. It's been on my conscience ever since.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal said his days of palling around with presidents ended with the Kennedys: ''I learned my lesson from the Kennedys, which is if you want to be effective as a commentator on political matters you've got to stay away from presidents. I was continually attacked as a Kennedy apologist.''</p>
        <p>He said he had met Mr. Clinton only briefly and found him charming, ''and I'm not easily charmed by presidents.''</p>
        <p>Al Gore is another matter. The two are distant cousins through Mr. Vidal's mother, though Mr. Vidal, in the polite way one talks about strayed relatives, leaves little doubt at his disappointment -- or perhaps disinterest -- in this particular member of the famous family.</p>
        <p>Would he vote for his cousin? Mr. Vidal, at this point speaking from his villa in Italy by telephone, laughed heartily at the question. ''As they say in the House of Representatives, at the end of the day, Gore is thicker than Nader,'' he said, presumably meaning that his blood-tie to Mr. Gore counted more than his ideological attraction to Ralph Nader.</p>
        <p>In any event, Mr. Vidal said he had never met Mr. Gore, and does not think it possible to learn much about him, or George W. Bush, from the way presidential campaigns are conducted. ''We'll never know whether they're interesting or not,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Speaking of himself, Mr. Vidal said that at his age, he had reached the ''springtime of my senility.'' As sharp and acerbic as ever, he is also white-haired, magisterial in bearing and a bit slow in his gait. ''I don't do e-mail,'' he declared. He did not seem fazed at the rehearsal when, during a break, Michael Learned asked if he would autograph a copy of his 1967 historical novel, ''Washington, D.C.'' He is about to publish ''The Golden Age,'' the concluding volume in his series on American history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vidal follows developments in American politics by way of CNN and The International Herald Tribune from his home in Ravello, though he is indignant at the suggestion that he is something of a recluse, a subject he had raised himself as the lunch in Beverly Hills had come to a quiet end, without dessert. ''The illusion that the press has carefully developed, because my views are not popular with management, is that I must be depicted as an exile -- an embittered expatriate. I am no such thing, and they know it. I've been involved in every election, in one way or another, as a commentator, sometimes as a candidate, for most of my life. And this, after all, is my subject as a writer.''</p>
