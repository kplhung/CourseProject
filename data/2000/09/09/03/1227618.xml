        <p>Usually, Robert Jones rolls pretty quickly through the toll plaza on the Garden State Parkway here, just west of Ocean City, flinging his 35 cents in the toll bin and going on his way.</p>
        <p>Ah, but this was his lucky day. Mr. Jones, a Ventnor resident, did not have the exact change, so he gave the toll taker a dollar, waited for his change and asked for a receipt -- even though seeking reimbursement from his employer for such a paltry sum was hardly worth it.</p>
        <p>There, in his hand, attached to the receipt, was a coupon for a buy-one-breakfast-get-another-free special at International House of Pancakes. ''I didn't know the Parkway was up for sale,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Well, not exactly. Don't expect to be passing by the Coca-Cola Exit 100 or be driving on the Pepsi Express Lanes any time soon. But in its quest to keep down tolls and pay its $200 million annual budget, the New Jersey Highway Authority, the quasi-public agency that runs the Parkway, has accepted a contract to attach manufacturers' coupons to toll receipts.</p>
        <p>''This allows us another way to use non-toll revenues to pay for the authority's budget.'' said Dennis Ingoglia, a spokesman for the authority.</p>
        <p>The contract with Travelers Marketing of Wellesley, Mass., is a drop in the proverbial toll bucket. The authority is guaranteed $80,000 a year on the coupon contract -- though Mr. Ingoglia said he expected the authority to earn $100,000 to $300,000 a year, depending on how well Travelers could sell the idea to drivers.</p>
        <p>For his part Russel Pergament, a partner at Travelers, is optimistic. ''These toll roads have a pressing need for revenue and are in a hostile environment when it comes to raising tolls,'' said Mr. Pergament.</p>
        <p>He said that Travelers Marketing started its business in 1997 by convincing the Massachusetts Turnpike to put coupons on its toll tickets and receipts. In 1998, the Pennsylvania Turnpike contracted with Travelers Marketing to add coupons to toll receipts and to put advertising at driver's eye level on the doors to the toll collectors' booths.</p>
        <p>''We've determined that one in four or one in five drivers ask for receipts,'' Mr. Pergament said. ''Most of them are in business -- salespeople, truckers. Advertisers love it. To have a person in business have a ticket given to them individually that they will retain, well, that is a great market.''</p>
        <p>So far, IHOP has been joined by Staples.com, the New York Post, the Supercuts hairstyling chain and Comcast cellular phones as advertisers on the program, which began on Aug. 10.</p>
        <p>The coupons come out at random at the toll booths, so drivers cannot be assured of getting, for example, the Staples.com coupon currently being issued that entitles the bearer to $20 in merchandise on orders of $50 or more at the office discounter's Web site. However, users of token lanes and the E-ZPass lanes -- of which there is supposed to be a proliferation in the coming years --  do not get the coupons because those drivers do not receive receipts.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Pergament tells it, a driver on the Massachusetts Turnpike was so intent on getting a coupon for Legal Seafood, a popular Boston restaurant, that he covered up his E-ZPass transponder and went through the toll booth several times.</p>
        <p>For several months, the Highway Authority has been trying to speed traffic through the tollbooths, installing E-ZPass technology and erecting signs to encourage its use. Mr. Ingoglia said he did not expect the coupons to change traffic patterns much.</p>
        <p>''During our test, there wasn't any significant problem with traffic,'' he said. ''This is just a value-added.''</p>
        <p>The fact is, the Highway Authority takes in a lot of non-toll revenue. In 1995, it privatized operations at the former Garden State Arts Center, for which it receives a minimum of $1.65 million a year from the operating contract and another $9 million over 10 years from PNC Bank for naming rights to the center. In addition, it receives $13.3 million a year for contracts at service areas and another $4 million for contracts to lay fiber optic cable and have cellular phone antennae along the Parkway.</p>
        <p>For now, the Parkway is the only toll road offering the coupons. ''We've looked into it, but it's not a lot of money, said James Crawford, executive director of the South Jersey Transportation Authority, which operates the Atlantic City Expressway.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority said the agencywas too busy implementing E-ZPass, which is supposed to begin on Sept. 30, to get involved in the arrangement now.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Pergament is enthusiastic about being the arrangement with the Parkway. ''With all those toll booths, the Parkway gives out more receipts than the volume we see on the Pennsylvania and Massachusetts Turnpikes together,'' he said. ''Drivers in New Jersey get hit up a lot, so the people at Staples and the other firms are really looking forward to a bonanza.''</p>
        <p>But the people who have to dole out the coupons every day at the 31 toll plazas on the Parkway are not nearly as enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>''What jerk thought up this idea?'' said a toll taker who asked not to be identified. ''Who needs a coupon with their toll receipt? Why don't they just name it the Staples Parkway and get it over with?</p>
