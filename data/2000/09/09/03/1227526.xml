        <p>De Kooning: In Process  Guild Hall, 158 Main Street, East Hampton. Through Oct. 8. (631) 324-0806.</p>
        <p>Focusing on instances when Willem de Kooning transferred dynamic configurations from paintings to drawings and from drawings to paintings, this absorbing exhibition reveals how the artist treated his accumulated ideas as reference tools to be occasionally explored further later.</p>
        <p>The presentation, which includes some works not previously exhibited, was organized by the Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale, with Klaus Kertess serving as guest curator. It was also shown in Houston.</p>
        <p>Coherent juxtapositions of the 30 examples demonstrate how de Kooning's process might sometimes involve tracings on vellum, references to small drawings or, in the 1980's, projecting the small drawings onto a large, new canvas. Evidence of the artist's use of tracing paper goes back to the 1940's, but the concentration here is on the 1970 to 1987 period.</p>
        <p>De Kooning pushed his configurations of lines, shapes and brush marks to create pulsating, energetic surfaces. Viewers respond to the sensory action, and the experience seems very immediate and direct. When the artist occasionally inserted a motif from his stored reference tools, he was testing the way it would contribute to the feeling of flux.</p>
        <p>In the examples here that include aspects of the female figure, gestures appear to accelerate as they simultaneously suggest both properties of the body and independent abstract movements. A sense of shifting is constant.</p>
        <p>The galleries offer ample opportunities to react to the lusciousness of de Kooning's vibrant paint, but there is a consciousness of correspondences and comparisons that tends to bring attention to line as well as to the loaded brush stroke.</p>
        <p>Linking the drawings and the paintings stimulates thoughts about the significance of line in de Kooning's work and clarifies his move to a more open, linear expression in the 80's. The show's eight wonderfully luminous and expansive paintings from that decade lend a great sense of virtuoso orchestration to their room. Pairing two with related drawings is particularly insightful.</p>
        <p>Although the exhibition probes a specific aspect of de Kooning's career, it is likely to provoke broader questioning. It stimulates interest in the construction of the de Kooning surfaces. Discussion often focuses on the action generated by the vigorous paint gestures. It also invites consideration of how the swift marks made in response to sensation triggered, or became part of, new sensations.</p>
        <p>Josh Dayton  Arlene Bujese Gallery, 66 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. Through Sept. 21. (631) 324-2823.</p>
        <p>Josh Dayton has been exhibiting throughout Long Island since the mid-80's and has gained respect for his consistently original ideas. Most reflect sources rooted in Abstract Expressionism and explore further steps by coaxing pigment to take on more texturing and by testing ways in which gestural strokes might become solid forms.</p>
        <p>This large show of paintings, works on paper and sculpture surveys Mr. Dayton's developments over 20 years. The paintings reveal a progression from scratchy, tactile qualities to increasingly dense configurations, daring uses of materials that extend beyond surface boundaries, combinations of loose and tight formats, symbolic, organic fragments floating on a flat field, and works that embody extraordinarily dynamic movements. Colors are somber in 1980, then use resonant blues in some pieces and mixed celebratory tones in others. When clay fragments become part of the surface, the terra cotta tone introduces connotations of antiquity.</p>
        <p>Color is also an integral part of the sculpture. Mottled, twisting forms that look like solidified swift brush strokes are characteristic of several stylistic phases. The recent ''Buttery Mask'' deals more with weight and with internal shadows and makes expressive components of the many irregular recesses.</p>
        <p>The survey presents at least six significant aspects of Mr. Dayton's work, each sufficiently imaginative and rich to warrant more attention. Everything generates visual energy and hints at interpretive thematic content. Nevertheless, in a modestly scaled gallery the combination of 40 examples becomes challenging because each needs a considerable amount of breathing space.</p>
        <p>2 Centuries of American Art  The Museums at Stony Brook, 1208 Route 25A, Stony Brook. Through Oct. 15. (631) 751-0066.</p>
        <p>It is always useful to have a large exhibition that gives a sense of the evolution of subject, taste and style in American art.</p>
        <p>This installation is based on the museum's collection and features some recent additions, including late 19th-century Long Island landscapes by Robert Bruce Crane and Alfred Thompson Bricher that are distinguished by radiant tonal harmonies and handsomely nuanced skies and an early 20th-century delicate, jewel-like painting by Helen Torr that nicely represents a new interest in making lyrical, semi-spiritual abstract interpretations of nature.</p>
        <p>The museum's Long Island material is admirable and there is a good range of coverage for ideas current in America before 1930. After that point there seems to be a need for shaping and strengthening.</p>
        <p>Mary Ellen Doyle's ''Farm Terrain,'' 1987, is one of the few outstanding contemporary selections. The work's dual landscape views are energized by a blend of watercolor strokes and pencil scratches and have a calculated color unity that makes the piece appear to be part abstraction and part illusion.</p>
        <p>Evolving directions are suggested by a number of highlights. John James Audubon's rendering of a barnacle goose represents an interest in scientific observation; Henry Suydam's mid-19th-century soft rendering of a distant horizon reveals emerging concerns for atmospheric tones; Edward Lamson Henry's ''Home Again'' hints at the importance genre depictions once enjoyed, and ''Arab Scene'' by Louis Comfort Tiffany demonstrates interests in luminism and in the exotic.</p>
