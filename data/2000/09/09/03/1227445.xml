        <p>FLYING around Europe has never been cheaper, especially for visitors from abroad. A new Oneworld Alliance air pass offers bargain fares to non-European visitors to 200 destinations in 50 countries in Europe and North Africa on member carriers -- including Aer Lingus, British Airways, Finnair and Iberia -- and a raft of regional affiliates.</p>
        <p>In addition, no-frills carriers like EasyJet, Ryanair, Go, Buzz and Virgin Express collectively serve about 50 destinations with fares up to one-third less than those of conventional carriers, and with fewer restrictions. Major carriers, such as Alitalia, Iberia, Swissair and Lufthansa, are responding with aggressive seat sales on their Web sites with fares that can be 50 percent less than a year ago.</p>

        <p>FLYING around Europe has never been cheaper, especially for visitors from abroad. A new Oneworld Alliance air pass offers bargain fares to non-European visitors to 200 destinations in 50 countries in Europe and North Africa on member carriers -- including Aer Lingus, British Airways, Finnair and Iberia -- and a raft of regional affiliates.</p>
        <p>In addition, no-frills carriers like EasyJet, Ryanair, Go, Buzz and Virgin Express collectively serve about 50 destinations with fares up to one-third less than those of conventional carriers, and with fewer restrictions. Major carriers, such as Alitalia, Iberia, Swissair and Lufthansa, are responding with aggressive seat sales on their Web sites with fares that can be 50 percent less than a year ago.</p>
        <p>The Oneworld pass, which became available a few weeks ago, is a great way to travel around Europe using one-way flights between most major cities. For example, flying from London to Dublin and then to Paris and on to Madrid will cost $320. You can buy just the two flight coupons needed to get the pass -- or as many more as you like. The price depends on the number and the length of flights.</p>
        <p>You must buy the coupons before you travel to Europe in conjunction with a round-trip intercontinental flight -- either direct from a Oneworld Alliance carrier (Aer Lingus, American Airlines, British Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Cathay Pacific, LanChile, Qantas) or through a travel agent. But you don't have to cross the Atlantic with a Oneworld carrier to get the air pass, which can be bought any time before you leave.</p>
        <p>Once ticketed, however, you cannot change your itinerary and must book the first European sector before you leave home; subsequent coupons, each for a single one-way flight, can be left open-dated. Changing the date of a flight (or several dates at the same time) costs $40. You have to decide in advance where you want to travel within one of five zones (see chart).</p>
        <p>You cannot switch coupons between zones. You are likely to get a booking on the flights you seek. Prices are much cheaper than normal one-way fares and are on a par with round-trip excursion fares -- London to Paris, for example, costs $113 to $128, at $1.49 to the pound; an air pass coupon is $60 one-way.</p>
        <p>And you do not have to return to the point of departure before flying on to your next destination; for example, if you had a Zone 1 coupon for London to Amsterdam, you could continue at your own expense to Munich to use your Zone 2 coupon for Munich to Berlin. For information: www.oneworldalliance.com or any Oneworld Alliance partner.</p>
        <p>More to Follow</p>
        <p>Look for announcements of similar air pass programs from the 13-airline Star Alliance (including Air Canada, SAS, United Airlines, Austrian Airlines and British Midland) and the four-member SkyTeam alliance (including Air France and Delta). A Europe by Air pass (Web site www.europebyair.com) allows travel on 17 regional carriers for $99 a flight (plus tax) to about 120 cities; you must buy at least three coupons.</p>
        <p>Swissair has a pass with its 10 Qualiflyer alliance partners, such as Sabena and TAP Air Portugal (www.qualiflyer.com). Three, four, five or six coupons cost $299, $389, $469 and $539, respectively. Add $100 if you do not fly with a Qualiflyer partner across the Atlantic. You need book only the first coupon before starting the trip.</p>
        <p>An example of a Qualiflyer routing for $469 might be the following: first coupon, Lisbon to Brussels to Stockholm; second coupon, Stockholm to Zurich; third coupon, Basel to Nice; fourth coupon, Nice to Madrid; and fifth coupon, Madrid to Lisbon. The savings versus regular fares would be at least 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Imitating Southwest</p>
        <p>No-frills airlines are expanding at a furious pace and have captured fans among business and leisure travelers on major routes within Europe. They are all modeled on Southwest Airlines, whose quick turn-arounds on short point-to-point routes, no-frills service in which passengers pay for drinks and snacks, and electronic ticketing all have helped drive down costs. The European no-frills lines fly fleets of Boeing 737's and have pioneered in on-line booking, often with discounts. (EasyJet says 80 percent of its passengers book on its Web site).</p>
        <p>The no-frills are all ticketless airlines: you get a reference number and just show up. The one-class seating has the same legroom as cattle class on regular carriers, and much the same baggage rules.</p>
        <p>No-frills airlines' Web sites are typically easier to navigate than those of major carriers. Ryanair (www.ryanair.com), which became the first no-frills carrier in Europe in 1985, is a ruthless cost cutter. It operates from Dublin, Stansted (30 miles northeast of London), Luton (32 miles northwest of London) and Glasgow, has a fleet of 31 737's and flies to 23 European cities.</p>
        <p>Virgin Express (Web site: www.virginexpress.com), which operates from Brussels with a fleet of 16 737's, serves nine major European cities. EasyJet (www.easyjet.com), which started service from Luton in October 1997 with a fleet of brand new 737-300's, will take delivery of 32 Boeing 737-700's over the next four years. The airline is based in Luton, Liverpool and Geneva; it flies from Luton to 16 cities, from Liverpool to 8, and from Geneva to Nice, Barcelona, Amsterdam and the London area (Stansted, Gatwick, Luton).</p>
        <p>Go (www.go-fly.com), British Airways' no-frills clone launched in May 1998 at Stansted, has a fleet of 13 737-300's and flies to 17 cities, including  Reykjavik. Buzz (www.buzzaway .com), a subsidiary of KLM that was launched in January, also operates from Stansted, with eight British Aerospace 146 jets and two 737's; it flies from Stansted to 14 cities.</p>
        <p>The no-frills use secondary airports in some cities because they are cheaper and have fewer slot restrictions. This may be inconvenient for an international traveler. But for point-to-point travel in Europe, airports like Stansted and Luton are as easy to get to from central London and a blessed relief from megahubs such as Heathrow and Gatwick.</p>
        <p>The Stansted and Luton airports, for example, are an easy 40-minute train ride from central London. EasyJet has a special bus deal from Luton ($7.50 round trip) that delivers you to central London. I sometimes take the 6:40 a.m. EasyJet flight from Nice to Luton, arriving in London at 7:50 local time, and I'm where I want to be in London an hour later.</p>
        <p>The no-frills lines often have better punctuality records than those of the major airlines. EasyJet is the only carrier that gives passengers a full refund if the flight is delayed by four hours or more. It also pays for hotel accommodation if the delay means an overnight at the airport.</p>
        <p>Ryanair sometimes uses what you might call tertiary airports. It flies, for example, in and out of Beauvais, 35 miles northwest of Paris (allow two and a half hours by bus from Porte Maillot in Paris); Charleroi, to the north of Brussels; and Lubeck, 40 miles from Hamburg.</p>
        <p>For many travelers, low fares make up for the inconvenience. No-frills carriers typically offer a spread of round-trip fares without the advance-purchase and Saturday-night-stay conditions of regular excursion fares. Ryanair has set the pace this summer with a rock-bottom $43 round-trip fare (with a two-day minimum stay) from Stansted to Hamburg, $103 to Verona and $43 to Stockholm. But these are lead-in prices, and you could end up paying more than five times as much if you don't get one of these special offers.</p>
        <p>The no-frills carriers maintain that a high percentage of their seats go for the lower prices. Buzz says that 30 percent of its seats are sold at its lowest published fare while Go says that half of its passengers traveled at the lowest advertised fare last year; Ryanair says that 50 percent of seats are available at the lowest advertised fare.</p>
        <p>Flexible Rules</p>
        <p>EasyJet is the only no-frills carrier that has kept the promise of low one-way fares that allow almost total flexibility for midweek travel. I paid $146 for a round-trip ticket from Nice to London in July, leaving on Tuesday and returning on Thursday, that would have cost more than $745 with British Airways on a 737 with similar seating. (EasyJet proudly announced that its 737 -- the latest addition to the fleet -- was two days old! And there seemed a normal mix of business and leisure travelers turning up for the flight.)</p>
        <p>One shouldn't forget, however, that EasyJet's fares can rise five- to tenfold as the plane fills up and that latecomers can pay more for a round trip than the excursion fare on a conventional airline. But even if you pay the highest fare out, you may get the cheapest fare back. You can change your reservation for a $15 charge, although you may have to upgrade to a higher fare. Thus I paid $74.50 from Nice to London with EasyJet recently, but $268.50 to come back. It would have been cheaper just to have paid the $74.50 one-way fare out and bought a round-trip excursion ticket back with British Airways, throwing away the return coupon. Then the trip would have cost me $255 instead of $358.</p>
        <p>This illustrates the fact that while no-frills carriers are likely to offer the best price on most occasions, never assume that they are the best value on all occasions. Compare price and flexibility and buy only as much flexibility as you need. Flight consolidators like Airline Network (www.netflights.com) and Trailfinders (www.trailfinders.com) offer bargains with conventional carriers: London to Amsterdam with British Midland for $130 with a Saturday night or a minimum two-night stay, or London to Paris with Air France for $186.50.</p>
        <p>Swissair has Zap and Fly fares (www.zapfly.ch) from Geneva or Zurich to cities like Amsterdam, Barcelona, Brussels, Nice and Rome with round-trip fares of $77 to $270. Fares are published on Wednesdays and are valid for 10 days with conditions including a Friday night stay.</p>
