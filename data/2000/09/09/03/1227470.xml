        <p>NEW YORKERS love to wear black for every occasion, but only until something darker comes along. New Yorkers do not socialize with their co-workers and have nothing but disdain for those who do. (If a New Yorker offers a colleague an extra Jets ticket, that colleague may not recognize the offer as a social invitation. He or she may take the ticket and sell it for a considerable profit.) And let it not be forgotten: New Yorkers are arrogant.

        <p>These are some of the colorful and fairly accurate characteristics of Manhattanites (and various of their outer-borough neighbors) that viewers will be reminded of on CBS's new series ''Welcome to New York.''

        <p>NEW YORKERS love to wear black for every occasion, but only until something darker comes along. New Yorkers do not socialize with their co-workers and have nothing but disdain for those who do. (If a New Yorker offers a colleague an extra Jets ticket, that colleague may not recognize the offer as a social invitation. He or she may take the ticket and sell it for a considerable profit.) And let it not be forgotten: New Yorkers are arrogant. As Marsha Bickner, a brittle television talk show producer played by Christine Baranski, says to a new employee from the Midwest: ''This is darling, Jim. You're trying to spar verbally with a New Yorker.''</p>
        <p>These are some of the colorful and fairly accurate characteristics of Manhattanites (and various of their outer-borough neighbors) that viewers will be reminded of on CBS's new series ''Welcome to New York.'' The show is notable for the return of Ms. Baranski to the prime-time schedule and for its origins at Worldwide Pants, David Letterman's production company. (The company's other new series, ''Ed,'' is about a big-city guy who moves back to his heartland hometown.)</p>
        <p>Advance word from television critics about the series, which has its premiere on Oct. 11, is positive. It has been given the closest thing CBS has, post-''Survivor,'' to a blockbuster time slot: Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m., right after the network's other great comic hope, ''The Bette Midler Show.'' More important, at least to viewers who prefer the sitcom likes of ''Frasier'' to, oh, ''The King of Queens,'' the show is rumored to have a certain amount of sophistication, humor that's more character-related than joke-driven (at a recent run-through of the second episode at the show's studio in Long Island City, Queens, the crew did a lot of laughing), and possibly even something relevant to say.</p>
        <p>''We can look at regional sensibilities, cultural sensibilities, generational sensibilities -- baby boomers and Generation Y,'' Ms. Baranski said. ''What is it about this culture we're living in now? You've got New Yorkers obsessing about their position in the office and their images.''</p>
        <p>''Jim kind of represents what America used to be,'' she added. ''They were friendly and open and celebrated birthdays'' at the office.</p>
        <p>Jim Gaffigan, her co-star, plays Jim, a television weather reporter in Indiana who moves east for a similar job at ''A.M. New York,'' a fictional morning show, and finds that he's considered odd because of some of his ideas -- like getting together after work with office mates or going to see ''Cats.'' (No, it is absolutely not David Letterman's life story, people connected with the show insist. Still, in person, Mr. Gaffigan, a stand-up comic who, like Mr. Letterman, really was a weatherman in his native Indiana, looks an awful lot like Dave's younger, slightly rounder brother.)</p>
        <p>''I wanted to play an outsider,'' said Mr. Gaffigan, who reported that, in an ethnocentric city, the closest thing he has to an ethnicity is Midwestern. ''But the irony of New York is that there really is no true insider.''</p>
        <p>''It's demystifying a lot of stereotypes,'' he said of the series. ''I've always resented, 'Will people in the middle of the country get it?' '' -- a concern expressed regularly by East and West Coast types about their movies, magazine articles and advertising campaigns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffigan has backstage support for his point of view. ''There used to be much larger regional differences in the country than there are now,'' said Barbara Wallace, an executive producer of the show. ''I think there's a sense about the middle of the country that they're simple. And good. Jim really likes when people expect him to be a rube and he's not.'' Apparently, this is true of both the actor and the character.</p>
        <p>Thomas Wolfe, Ms. Wallace's husband and co-executive producer, is equally appalled by the coasts' view. ''It's not 'Green Acres' or something, or 'The Beverly Hillbillies,' '' he said of the United States between Manhattan and Los Angeles. If everybody shops at the Gap, Mr. Wolfe suggested, how different can we be?</p>
        <p>Good point, but quintessential New Yorkness may rest on other qualifications. Like the little quirks of life here. The Wallace-Wolfes, for instance, recently moved to Manhattan after a decade or so in Southern California. (Before that, they were in Chicago. They both consider themselves Midwesterners, they say.) The apartment-hunting experience was memorable.</p>
        <p>''We know nothing about living here,'' he said. ''The nefarious things they tell you to do!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wallace chimed in, imitating a super with an under-the-table deal to offer, ''And you're gonna write the check to Ronald's Dry Cleaning.'' An episode on apartment hunting will soon be in the works, they said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Baranski, who agreed to do the series only if it was filmed in New York, could give them some hints. She grew up in Buffalo, moved to Manhattan when she was 18 to attend the Juilliard School and stayed (eventually going suburban, in Connecticut) to build an impressive stage career, including a couple of Tony Awards. And that was that, until ''Cybill'' came along.</p>
        <p>''I managed to avoid doing sitcoms until my early 40's,'' she said, looking chic in neutrals, pearls and three-inch heels -- her Marsha Bickner wardrobe -- during a break in rehearsals. Her character on ''Cybill,'' the wisecracking, martini-loving, vengefully divorced Maryann Thorpe, who loved to play pranks on her ex-husband, Dr. Dick, brought her a new kind of popularity and fame. ''Now,'' she said, ''I have no regrets.''</p>
        <p>Marsha Bickner is no Maryann Thorpe, but the two characters share the same commanding presence. Marsha, it seems, could take anybody in a duel of wits. One possible exception might be Darlene Conner, the more-apathetic-than-thou daughter once played by Sara Gilbert on ''Roseanne.'' And who should be playing Marsha's 20-something assistant, Amy, but Ms. Gilbert in all her deadpan glory?</p>
        <p>''She's really smart and really manipulative,'' Ms. Gilbert said happily of her character. ''She really knows how to play this corporate game. She lives to run the network.'' Which, Ms. Gilbert explained, is Amy's ultimate career goal. Until then it's her job to do Marsha's dirty work, like telling Kitty, the ''A.M. New York'' co-host, not to act so cute on camera.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gilbert, who was born in Santa Monica, Calif., and began acting when she was 6, doesn't know much firsthand about Middle America, but she does experience New York as foreign. ''I think it is a little slower there,'' she said of California. ''And it's less polite here. You need to be more efficient in New York, and that takes up the room that politeness occupies in Los Angeles.''</p>
        <p>THE ensemble cast also includes others who were working in California until recently. Rocky Carroll, formerly of ''Chicago Hope,'' plays Adrian Spencer, the talk show's egotistical host, and Anthony De Sando is Vince Verbena, Jim's assistant. Mr. Gaffigan, in the tradition of stand-up comics who get their own series, plays a character named Jim Gaffigan.</p>
        <p>Shades of ''Seinfeld.'' And if the two shows have anything in common, it could be the opportunities both offer Americans to love-hate a group of highly flawed New Yorkers. New York audiences may find the show equally appealing. It's not so much that we thrive on criticism. It's that any comment -- no matter how insulting -- that establishes our uniqueness just makes us feel special.</p>
        <p>TELEVISION/RADIO  Correction:  September 17, 2000, Sunday  An article in Arts &amp; Leisure on Sept. 3 about the new CBS series ''Welcome to New York'' referred incorrectly to the background of Jim Gaffigan, a star of the show. While he was born and reared in Indiana, he was not a weatherman there.</p>
