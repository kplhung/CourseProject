        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Ron Rosenbaum, in his essay ''The Play's the Thing, Again'' (Aug. 6), discusses the talk I delivered as a respondent to the Harold Bloom seminar at the April 2000 Shakespeare Association of America convention. I'd like to make a few clarifications:</p>
        <p>While I appreciate Rosenbaum's enthusiasm for my role in the Bloom seminar, my remarks were not, as he put it, ''a 'goodbye to all that' valedictory to theory'' but rather a suggestion that literary scholars start using theory in fresh, unpredictable and, most importantly, unorthodox new ways, and in language more comprehensible both within and beyond the academy.</p>
        <p>There was also a factual error in Rosenbaum's essay. I did not lead the 1999 seminar on ''Hamlet,'' ''Troilus and Cressida'' and ''Measure for Measure.'' I was a respondent to that seminar, which was organized and led by Thomas Cartelli, professor of English at Muhlenberg College.</p>
