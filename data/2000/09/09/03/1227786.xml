        <p>The Jets' regular season begins today against Green Bay at Lambeau Field, but the restiveness that accompanied an off-season of extraordinary tumult may linger for a while. An almost eerily quiet training camp -- a quiet assured in some part by the trade of receiver Keyshawn Johnson -- gives way to a season in which the Jets will be required to solve their mysteries as a team just as surely as they must solve opposing defenses.</p>
        <p>Is Vinny Testaverde healthy enough -- and young enough -- to return to something approaching his 1998 form? Will Mike Nolan's defense look much different from Bill Belichick's or, as several players have noted, is Nolan spending more time getting used to them than they are to him? Whither the passing game, now that Johnson, the big, have-no-fear receiver, is gone and the starting two receivers are about the height of the average accountant? What sort of imprint will Coach Al Groh try to put on the team before the inevitable looming shadow of Bill Parcells threatens to engulf him?</p>
        <p>Groh talked to some of his key veterans as early as spring minicamp to impress upon them the importance of a fast start this season. A quick look in the mirror may be in order as well.</p>
        <p>''I think we're trying to find our personality,'' center Kevin Mawae said. ''That may take half a season to find. For us, our goal is to find it really early.''</p>
        <p>The Jets are still trying to figure out Groh, the cerebral, serious, detail-oriented successor to the larger-than-life Parcells. Groh is less prone to bombast, but he also lacks Parcells' gift for delivering a well-timed zinger with a message attached. When asked how the adjustment was going, Mawae said: ''How do you adjust to a new car? It's the same thing. You break it in. You see what you like and what you don't like.''</p>
        <p>The Jets are hoping to accomplish a Wallenda-like balancing act: reinvent themselves under a new owner and new coaching staff with a revived quarterback and a new top receiver, while maintaining all the good things Parcells did to transform the Jets into Super Bowl contenders before Testaverde's devastating Achilles' injury last year.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of questions to be answered,'' Testaverde said. ''We've got a head coach who steps down and goes to the front office, another head coach goes to New England. We've got Al taking over, we lose the entire defensive staff except for Al, we lose our offensive coordinator and our tight ends coach. We lose Keyshawn. We have Jason Fabini coming back from knee surgery. We have me coming back from a major injury, one that people call career-threatening.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of uncertainty until we actually get into the season and prove that this is still a very good football team with some new faces both on the coaching staff and down in the locker room.''</p>
        <p>The Jets, while they look for answers, are fortunate to play in a division experiencing incredible flux. Of the five teams in the A.F.C. East, three -- the Jets, the Patriots and the Dolphins -- have new head coaches. Buffalo and Miami have quarterback controversies and the trade of Johnson was no more stunning to Jets fans than when Buffalo jettisoned three players who made them contenders for years. Only Indianapolis, with its trio of offensive stars, seems stable in its position at the top of the division, which it won last season with a 13-3 record.</p>
        <p>Few of those teams have as many issues unfolding simultaneously. Nolan has made only minor adjustments from the defense Belichick crafted, but the Jets hope their pass rush is bolstered by the rookies Shaun Ellis and John Abraham, who will not start today but are expected to play plenty. Testaverde, who is nearing 37, is healthy and, his teammates attest, back to preinjury form, perhaps even better for the one-year rest. But Testaverde played sparingly in the preseason, and even he admits that he does not know how he will react when he drops back in the pocket for the first time.</p>
        <p>More than that, one wonders what he will see when he looks downfield. The 5-foot-10-inch Wayne Chrebet possesses a marvelous ability to get free from defenses, but he will face increased attention in Johnson's absence. Dedric Ward is no taller than Chrebet. Vincent Brisby was signed recently to provide the big-body, over-the-middle capability that was lost when Johnson was sent packing.</p>
        <p>If the offense stalls, it will not take long for observers to wistfully recall Johnson's exploits. The Jets have not started the season at better than 1-2 since 1994, but Groh needs a fast start so that the Bill Buzz doesn't grow into a roar.</p>
        <p>Groh has, according to Testaverde, made subtle changes to practices and scheduling, but there has been no dramatic gesture to put his own stamp on the team. His relationship with Parcells is simple and fluid, Groh says: sometimes they talk a few times a day, sometimes not at all.</p>
        <p>''I said before I was the coach, it was never my intention to provide continuity,'' Groh said. ''It was a circumstance. I don't ever work with or around a football legend. He's a great resource to me. That he's a legend to somebody else, that's somebody else's perception.''</p>
        <p>But several players, most notably Testaverde and linebacker Bryan Cox, say that having Parcells in the building has smoothed the segue to the new season. When the season is over, it will inevitably be viewed through a prism colored by Parcells's personality and success, one that could easily distort the answers the Jets uncover this season.</p>
        <p>''This is still Bill's team,'' Cox said. ''Al is the coach. Al has all the decisions. But a lot of people here haven't changed. It's the same players and the same system Bill had. The bottom line is Bill is still the director of football operations. He lets Al do all the things he wants to do, but Al can lean on him for advice. Al's running everything and Bill is tucked away in case Al wants him.''</p>
