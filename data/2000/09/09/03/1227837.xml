        <p>In an attempt to seize the compound of the Aryan Nations, Morris S. Dees Jr. went to court in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Mr. Dees, founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, has won a series of civil right suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations in a campaign to drive them out of business. The Aryan Nations compound has been a base for white supremacists for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>His suit contends that compound guards, the Aryan Nations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his second in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable for an attack on a woman and her son, both white, by the guards in July 1998. Mr. Dees' goal is to win a large judgment that will force the group to surrender their compound in payment.</p>
