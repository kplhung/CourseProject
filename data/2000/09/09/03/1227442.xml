        <p>Summer in Napa and Sonoma Counties is all giant blue skies, lush green vine-covered hills -- and crowds. Lots of crowds.</p>
        <p>The most joyous time of the year in this celebrated wine region comes when the light softens and the throngs of tourists thin out a little. September is the height of the harvest season, when nearly 500 vineyards pick and squash the grapes that may turn out the next big wines.</p>
        <p>Each year, thousands of wine pilgrims make their way through the Napa Valley, just 30 miles long and 5 miles wide, and its more down-to-earth sister, Sonoma County, and discover that there is more to this beautiful stretch of Northern California than vineyards. There are villages filled with antiques stores, bike trails, spas, and festivals seemingly every weekend during the harvest.</p>
        <p>Driving on Route 29, the main, usually clogged artery through the Napa Valley, can test nerves like a dripping faucet; and although Route 12, the Sonoma Highway, can get crowded, Sonoma's vineyards are more spread out, relieving the jams.</p>
        <p>But there are other ways to see the sights. The relatively flat valleys mean easy bicycle riding, and towns like Petaluma, in Sonoma, and Yountville, in Napa, both stocked with antiques and specialty shops, are made for walking.</p>
        <p>Wineries</p>
        <p>There are more than 250 vineyards in the Napa Valley, and over 190 in Sonoma County. Many of them offer tours and free samples.</p>
        <p>The wine-aging caves at Beringer Vineyards, 2000 Main Street, St. Helena, (707) 963-4812, are just one of the reasons this winery, the oldest continuously operating one in Napa Valley, is a perennial on the must-see list. The 17-room Victorian Rhine House, on the National Register of Historic Places, wows the crowds with its stained glass and ornate wood panels. Open daily 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. through October then till 5 p.m. Tours cost $5.</p>
        <p>Kenwood Vineyards, 9592 Sonoma Highway, Kenwood, (707) 833-5891, with its old-world lodge and peaceful gardens, is best known for its exclusive rights to Jack London's vineyards and the wine it bottles each year in the writer's honor. Open daily 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>The Gloria Ferrer Champagne Caves, at 23555 Highway 121, Sonoma, (707) 996-7256, is the American counterpart to Barcelona's ancient Ferrer family enterprise -- makers of Freixenet sparkling wines. The champagne house is in a Mediterranean-style villa with a terrace. Open 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Dry Creek Vineyards, four miles north of Healdsburg at 3770 Lambert Bridge Road, (707) 433-1000, is famous for its cabernet sauvignon and sauvignon blanc. Open daily from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., with free tastings, but no tours.</p>
        <p>Winery lists are available from the Napa Valley Conference and Visitors Bureau, (707) 226-7459, or at www .napavalley.com. For those in Sonoma, contact the Sonoma County Tourism Program, (800) 576-6662, or see www.sonoma.com.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>Most wineries offer harvest celebrations, including the Harvest in the Vineyard at the St. Francis Winery in Kenwood this Saturday. The release of five reserve reds will be celebrated with food to match, including a buffet, and live music from noon to 4:30 p.m. Reservations required. Fee: $75; (707) 833-4666.</p>
        <p>The 103rd Valley of the Moon Vintage Festival, California's longest running harvest celebration, opens Sept. 22 with a patron's night; wine and food tasting costs $40 a person.  On Sept. 23 and 24, admission is free for a grape-stomping competition, a firefighter's water fight, a historic re-enactment of the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt, and other events, in or near Sonoma Plaza, the historic eight-acre Spanish-style square. Information: (707) 996-2109, or www .sonomavinfest.com.</p>
        <p>You can sample the goods from over 20 wineries and 20 restaurants at the Napa Valley Harvest Festival, Sept. 23 from 1 to 5 p.m. at the Charles Krug Winery in St. Helena. There will be music, a silent auction and something modestly referred to as the World Famous Kiwanis Beef Barbecue. Tickets: $45 or $50 at the door, if available; (800) 698-0997.</p>
        <p>The American Harvest Workshop Dinners at the Cakebread Cellars in Rutherford on Sept. 11 and 12 feature five-course dinners, prepared by six chefs from around the country, including Rocco DiSpirito from Union Pacific in New York, with dishes paired with five to seven Cakebread wines. The cost is $155 a person; (707) 963-5221.</p>
        <p>At the Sonoma County Harvest Fair, Oct. 6 to 8 at the county fairgrounds, 1350 Bennett Valley Road, Santa Rosa, there will be a grape stomp, wine tasting, food, arts, crafts, beer booths and children's exhibits. Admission is $5, $2 for ages 60 and up on Oct. 6, and $2 for children ages 7 to 12; (707) 545-4203.</p>
        <p>For a musical respite, try the Russian River Jazz Festival, this Saturday and Sunday at Johnson's Beach in Guerneville. Among those scheduled to perform are the Chick Corea Trio and Branford Marsalis. Tickets: $40 a day and $75 for both days in advance, $43 and $80 at the gate; (707) 869-3940.</p>
        <p>A different fruit of the vine is saluted at the Kendall-Jackson Heirloom Tomato Festival, Saturday 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Kendall-Jackson Wine Center in Fulton; (800) 544-4413, extension 770. The tomatoes come in every color and flavor, as do the wines available for tasting. Foods from Sonoma County and the San Francisco Bay area will also be served. Tickets, $30, include food sampling, wine tasting and a glass.</p>
        <p>And in a land of wine, beer is not forgotten. The Calistoga Beer, Sausage and Chile Festival, 1 to 5 p.m. Sept. 30 at the Napa County Fairgrounds in Calistoga, serves up microbrews, regional home brews, cider and sausages from the area. There will be live blues and Cajun music, too. Admission $25, $13 for a designated driver; (707) 942-6333.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>The pleasures of Yountville, a picture-postcard town in the heart of the Napa Valley, include Vintage 1870, 6526 Washington Street, a winery converted into a mall of boutiques, and, next door, the Depot Gallery, an artists' collective. Yountville City Park, at Washington and Lincoln Streets, is a favorite spot for people watching. The nearby cemetery, where town fathers are buried, is a fascinating look at the past.</p>
        <p>Petaluma, once described as the World's Egg Basket, still has chicken ranches, but it is becoming a destination for a downtown chock-full of antiques stores and boutiques. A good walking tour brochure is available at the Petaluma Chamber of Commerce, 799 Baywood Drive, Petaluma, Calif. 94952; (707) 762-2785.</p>
        <p>Bicycle riding is a popular way to tour the countryside, with traffic not so bad if you stay off the main roads. The Napa County Transportation Planning Association has a comprehensive valleywide bicycle map identifying major and minor routes, favorite rural roads and a list of rental companies, some of whom can provide picnic lunches. It's available at the Napa Valley Conference and Visitors Bureau Center, 1310 Napa Town Center, (707) 226-7459. The Sonoma Valley Visitors Bureau, (707) 996-1090, also offers a free listing of bicycling routes.</p>
        <p>Just as wines need careful handling, sometimes their purchasers do, too. A variety of spas can be found in and near Calistoga, the funky town built atop a boiling underground river.</p>
        <p>Nance's Hot Springs, 1614 Lincoln Avenue, (707) 942-6211, offers a hot spring mineral bath, steam bath, black volanic mud bath and blanket sweat. One of every treatment, including a massage, costs $80.</p>
        <p>Indian Springs Spa, 1712 Lincoln Avenue, (707) 942-4913, includes a geyser-heated mineral swimming pool, as well as mud and mineral baths and massages. Treatments cost $65 to $150.</p>
        <p>For those who prefer to watch geothermal activity from a distance, two miles north of Calistoga at 1299 Tubbs Lane is Old Faithful Geyser of California. The geyser roars to life with a 60-foot-high plume of 350-degree water and steam about every 20 minutes. Open daily. Admission: $6, $5 for ages 60 and up and $2 for ages 6 to 12; (707) 942-6463.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The Mount View Hotel, 1457 Lincoln Avenue, Calistoga, (707) 942-6877, fax (707) 942-6904, is a beautifully restored 1917 house decorated in country French style. Rates are $125 to $275, with a Continental breakfast served in the 29 rooms and 3 cottages.</p>
        <p>Tall Timbers Chalets, off Highway 29 at 1012 Darms Lane, south of Yountville, (707) 252-7810, fax (707) 252-1055, is a nice change from the  Victorian mansion bed-and-breakfasts that dot the valley. The eight country cottages, some with decks or porches, sleep four and cost $150.</p>
        <p>Budget: The Village Inn, 20822 River Boulevard, (707) 865-2304, fax (707) 865-2332, in Monte Rio, an old beach town on the Russian River with a big faded ''Vacation Wonderland'' sign over the highway, is where the winter classic ''Holiday Inn'' was filmed. It is also funky and comfortable, with 10 rooms, with bathrooms, costing $65 to $140.</p>
        <p>The Best Western Inn at the Vine, 100 Soscol Avenue, Napa, (707) 257-1930, fax (707) 255-0709, offers 68 rooms and loft suites with living rooms, a heated pool and whirlpool. Rates start at $110.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Madrona Manor, 1001 Westside Road, Healdsburg, (800) 258-4003, fax (707) 433-0703, is a Sonoma institution. The 1881 Victorian mansion and renovated outbuildings have 18 rooms and 4 suites, all decorated differently, some with antiques, most with fireplaces. Rates are $165 to $450, with breakfast.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>The French Laundry, 6640 Washington Street, Yountville, (707) 944-2380, is so exclusive it sometimes doesn't even answer its reservations line. In a century-old stone house (that was, indeed, a French steam laundry), the restaurant is strictly prix fixe -- $80 a person for a five-course vegetarian offering; $90 for a more robust meal (chicken and fish), $105 for the nine-course chef's tasting menu. Reservations are taken two months ahead of the dining date.</p>
        <p>Tra Vigne, 1050 Charter Oak Avenue, St. Helena, (707) 963-4444, is a cozy trattoria in a landmark stone building. Its menu, regional Italian, offers interesting small plates of pastas and pizzas to complement its meats and fish. Dinner for two, including wine, is about $80.</p>
        <p>The Restaurant at the Sonoma Mission Inn and Spa, 18140 Sonoma Highway, Boyes Hot Springs, (707) 938-9000, is noted for what is known as the ''wine country style'' menu -- clay-oven-roasted whole fish, for example, or wilted spinach and gingered red lentils. Dinner for two, with wine, about $90.</p>
        <p>Deuce, 691 Broadway, Sonoma, (707) 933-3823, is a clean, well-lighted place with both contemporary (grilled salmon with red bean chile, forbidden black rice and avocado salsa) and traditional (roasted pork loin) American food, featuring local produce and wines. Dinner for two, with wine, about $70.</p>
