        <p>FORMER adversaries in the so-called airport border wars between Westchester and Connecticut came together last week to fight a common enemy.</p>
        <p>County Executive Andrew J. Spano brought together government representatives from Westchester and neighboring Fairfield County to announce a strategy to prevent Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a Delta Airlines subsidiary, from beginning a 5:59 a.m. flight at Westchester County Airport, which was to start this month.</p>
        <p>Such a flight would occur 31 minutes before the voluntary curfew of midnight to 6:30 a.m. ends. The voluntary curfew has been recognized for 20 years.</p>
        <p>Although some other airlines already schedule departures between 6 and 6:30, Mr. Spano insisted that by stopping Atlantic Southeast Airlines he wanted to prevent ''a cascade of events where other airlines will do that as well.''</p>
        <p>He was joined at a news conference at the airport by Representatives Nita Lowey and Sue W. Kelly of Westchester and Christopher Shays of Fairfield County as well as the chairman of the county's Board of Legislators, George S. Latimer, and the first selectwoman of Greenwich, Lolly Prince.</p>
        <p>''This issue goes to the very quality of life, not only in Westchester but also in Connecticut,'' Mr. Spano said. ''This administration has a no-expansion policy at the airport. Even if we solve this problem, there may be another Delta coming down the road. What we're asking today is for our Congressional representatives to look at the legislation and give us a mandatory curfew.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano is seeking a federal law that would require airlines at the county airport to obey a mandatory curfew. Support for such legislation cut across party lines.</p>
        <p>''We are Republicans and Democrats here,'' Mr. Latimer said. ''We are from different states, but this is a common interest. It's the single most important battle we've had here. If major commercial airlines are flying in and out at will, we've lost the core protection for the airport and the watershed.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lowey added: ''If we can't have a voluntary curfew, we're going to work together as a delegation to get a mandatory curfew. This airport was never meant to be a major commercial aircraft center.''</p>
        <p>Besides airport neighbors who turned out, some bearing hand-lettered signs that read ''Don't Wake Us Up, Delta,'' ''Silence Is Golden'' and ''Atlantic Southeast: Let Us Sleep,'' and environmental activists,  many elected county officials were there.</p>
        <p>An official of Atlantic Southeast said the airline was open to a compromise.</p>
        <p>''The 5:59 a.m. departure is not ideal,'' said Sam Watts, the airline's vice president of marketing and corporate communications. ''We would prefer to depart a bit later but weren't able to obtain another time. We will continue to talk with the appropriate authorities to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. We would hope there would be an open dialogue.''</p>
        <p>But critics of the airline simply want it to abide by the curfew.</p>
        <p>''The voluntary curfew is a good compromise,'' said Ellen Kaidanow, chairwoman of the Harrison airport committee. ''For a flight of maybe 30 to 50 people, they'll wake up hundreds of thousands of people.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Prince, first selectwoman of Greenwich, added: ''Delta is breaking something that we think is sacred. Our goal is to get the teeth that will allow us to have a mandatory curfew. We wholeheartedly support this effort and want to be part of a solution.''</p>
        <p>To many long-term airport and environmental activists, such cooperation was a welcome step.</p>
        <p>Bruce Carlsten, a member of the Purchase Friends Meeting, whose meetinghouse borders the airport, said, ''I think it's very exciting to see a group with different minds on different issues with all their oars in the water pulling together.''</p>
