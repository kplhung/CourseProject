        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Sincere thanks to John Schulian for reminding me of my own membership in the Loyal Order of Ramsey [''One Album to His Name, but It's the Stuff of Legend,'' Aug. 27]. As a tortured romantic just discovering country and bluegrass back in the mid-70's, I found Willis Alan Ramsey's album to be a true, soulful expression of my own peculiar angst as well as the benchmark for all Texas singer-songwriters. Not only did I sing along with every song, I drove my roommates crazy with my own guitar-strummed rendition of ''Ballad of Spider John.''</p>

        <p>My copy of the album suffered a very Ramseyesque fate: I loaned it to a girlfriend who dropped me a week later without relinquishing it. But thanks to Mr. Schulian, I will have to end my self-imposed moratorium on buying CD's and pick up a new copy (wish it was still available on vinyl). I hope my wife will understand.</p>
