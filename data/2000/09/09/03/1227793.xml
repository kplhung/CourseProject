        <p>With green acres of cornstalks rolling as far as the eye can see, these few weeks just before the fall harvest are probably the loveliest time of the year here.</p>
        <p>But this season is also, perhaps, the most hazardous, thanks in large part to that very corn, which has grown to unusual heights this summer with the help of some well-timed spring rains.</p>
        <p>The problem is traffic accidents. This town, like hundreds in Iowa, is crisscrossed by dozens of gravel roads, and many of the intersections have no stop signs. The corn can obscure drivers' views of coming traffic, often leading to wrecks.</p>
        <p>''I've seen people come speeding through here at all hours of the night,'' said Jason Hemann, a farmer who lives near such an intersection, and who says more stop signs would help. ''I know which intersections to stop at, but a lot of people come through gawking and don't stop.''</p>
        <p>As long as there have been corn and cars, there have been problems in Iowa in August, said Tom Welch, of the Iowa Department of Transportation. But Mr. Welch, who estimates there are 60 to 70 corn-related accidents in Iowa each summer, says this year's giant corn crop is not the only cause.</p>
        <p>The problem in places like Grimes, which is in one of the fastest-growing counties in Iowa, is compounded by the migration of city people from nearby Des Moines.</p>
        <p>These days, half-million-dollar homes and new schools are springing up on former corn fields. Housing developments butt up against farms.</p>
        <p>''Farm people know to slow down,'' said Doug James, who farms with Mr. Hemann. ''The city folk from Des Moines drive out here and like to stop and look, 'Ooh, look at the corn, look at the farm.' ''</p>
        <p>Dawn Barkley joins most farmers in saying that more stop signs would solve the problem. In July, when Mrs. Barkley's 18-year-old son, Nick, was killed in an accident outside Sioux City, another place where urban sprawl has complicated matters, state police told her that corn might have been a factor. ''A stop sign costs $250,'' said Mrs. Barkley. ''But they won't put one up until someone dies.''</p>
        <p>The people in Grimes who are not farmers, most of them professionals who work in the city, acknowledge that they use the gravel roads to avoid the busy highways.</p>
        <p>''I've gone through here fast early in the morning or in the afternoon, when I'm going to pick up my daughter from day care,'' said Scott Kruse, who moved to Grimes about four years ago. ''A lot of people use these roads to avoid traffic. You can wait up to 15 minutes at the stop sign over there,'' Mr. Kruse said, pointing to the paved highway.</p>
        <p>But he said the corn, not just the drivers, was to blame for the accidents, and he said the crops should be cut back. A former farmer, he noted that the tops of the stalks could be removed without damaging the corn, but he said many farmers did not bother because they were busy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welch said a balance must be struck. Stop signs, he said, are not necessarily the answer in towns where unrestricted intersections have been around for dozens of years, and where unwritten rules dictate who is supposed to yield to whom on which road.</p>
        <p>''More stop signs just create a disrespect for those signs,'' Mr. Welch said. But he asked: ''How much do we accommodate the driver in these situations? They have a responsibility themselves.'' The best solution, he suggested, was cutting back corn where possible.</p>
        <p>The farmers resent that suggestion. Jay Farrow, a retired farmer, said farmers should be able to grow as much corn as possible.</p>
        <p>''A bushel of corn hardly buys you a bottle of pop anymore,'' he said.</p>
