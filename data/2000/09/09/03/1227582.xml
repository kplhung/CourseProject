        <p>Suzana Oei letter on Lili Hartman's August 20 letter in response to Peter Applebome column on disciplining unruly children (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In regards to Peter Applebome's column and the following mail, I was deeply sorry that Lili Hartman of Maplewood did not tell us what the black woman teacher/dean of students said to the unruly basketball players (Letters, Aug. 20). How that  would have helped us all in similar circumstances! As a lifetime confronter of misbehaving youngsters, I often ask them to be mindful of others' rights and feelings. Not only do I think that older people set the standards for acceptable adult behavior in growing children, but studies have proven it. According to the study I read on criminals, the sooner they were confronted and shown that such choices would be punished, the sooner they slowed or stopped such actions. And it is easily observed in herd animals. Rambuncious male colts are nipped, pushed aside and eventually forced from the sanctuary of the herd until they toe the desired and acceptable line.</p>
