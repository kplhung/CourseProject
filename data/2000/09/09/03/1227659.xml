        <p>Though commendable, your article on teen suicide (''Working to Stop Suicides of Teenagers,'' July 30) is remiss in failing to address the issue of homosexuality.</p>
        <p>Numerous studies (the 1989 Health and Human Services ''Report on the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide''; Gary Remafedi's 1991 book ''Death by Denial''; the 1997 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey) confirm that lesbian, gay and bisexual youths are disproportionately likely to commit suicide.</p>
        <p>We would never know this, however, to read the comments of Dr. David Shaffer of Columbia University, that boys' suicides ''nearly always happen shortly after they've gotten into trouble or argued with a girlfriend.''</p>
        <p>If sexual-minority youth remain invisible even to those who profess to help them, efforts to reduce teenage suicides in Connecticut are destined to fail.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there is much we can do. We can -- indeed, we must -- ensure that all young people have access to accurate, timely information about sexual orientation. We must make school environments free of the anti-gay harassment that has been tolerated for too long.</p>
        <p>We must write curriculums that are inclusive of sexual orientation (not only in health classes but also in history, psychology, biology and literature). We must encourage the creation of gay-straight alliances in middle and high schools.</p>
        <p>Finally, those of us who are gay must provide young people with a model of adulthood that is honest and fully integrated.</p>
        <p>These steps, while simple, may prove bold enough to counter years of stigma, disinformation and oppression. They may actually save lives.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL FIORELLO  Bridgeport</p>
        <p>The writer is a chairman of the Connecticut chapter of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network.</p>
