        <p>To the Editor: For 20 years Lindblad Expeditions has been guiding travelers on small ships in their exploration of the world, including Alaska.</p>
        <p>We strive to integrate ourselves into the communities we visit. Only when tour operators participate as stakeholders in their destinations can we enjoy the benefits of tourism while keeping to a minimum the degradation that can come with untethered industrial tourism.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the relationship between tourism and regulating bodies, conservation organizations and local communities is often adversarial or at best suspicious. We have seen the value of open dialogue and partnerships in places like Baja California and the Galapagos Islands. We have established the Galapagos Conservation Fund, through which government agencies, nonprofit organizations, local communities and tour operators work toward common goals. Perhaps the current issues in Alaska will initiate similar processes.</p>
