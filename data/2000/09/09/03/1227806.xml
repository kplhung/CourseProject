        <p>Hate Floats Won't Fly At Firefighters' Parade</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, the Broad Channel Volunteer Fire Department will sponsor its first Labor Day parade since 1998, when two city firefighters and a police officer were fired after appearing in blackface. This year, however, safeguards are in place to keep any offensive floats from proceeding down Cross Bay Boulevard in Broad Channel, a neighborhood between Howard Beach and the Rockaways in Queens.</p>
        <p>In previous years, residents put together floats with themes touching on minority groups; they contended that they were spoofing their neighborhood's lack of ethnic diversity. Two years ago, that tradition offended many people citywide, particularly when a firefighter decided to hang off the back of a truck, an allusion to the racially motivated dragging death of James Byrd Jr. in Texas earlier that year. A video of the float was broadcast on WCBS-TV the next day.</p>
        <p>This year, a committee that includes local officials will review all marchers an hour before the parade begins, said a firefighter who would not give his name.</p>
        <p>''Since that incident, I think everyone knows not to do anything to upset any ethnic groups,'' he said. Several calls to Timothy Keenan, chief of the volunteer department, were not returned.</p>
        <p>Using a similar committee last year, the parade proceeded without incident.</p>
        <p>The three men who were fired were employees of city departments. They were not affiliated with the volunteer fire department, which sponsors the parade every other year. In alternate years, the event is sponsored by the Broad Channel Athletic Club, the firefighter said.</p>
        <p>''The parade has nothing to do with us. All we do is sponsor it,'' he said. ''The spoofs have nothing to do with the firehouse. They're done by town members.''</p>
        <p>The parade starts at 1 p.m. at the southern end of Broad Channel.</p>
        <p>Legal Battles Not Over In Assisted-Suicide Case</p>
        <p>George Delury, the writer and editor who pleaded guilty to assisting in his wife's suicide in 1995, is now in the midst of a wrongful-death suit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Delury served four months of a six-month sentence for attempted manslaughter in 1996. The next year, his book, ''But What If She Wants to Die?'' revealed how he had placed a bag over her head after helping her drink a mixture of honey, water and an antidepressant, information he had withheld from the courts. Mr. Delury wrote that he wanted to make sure that his wife, Myrna Lebov, who was 52 and had multiple sclerosis, died before her health aide arrived at their Upper West Side home.</p>
        <p>Steven G. Mintz, the lawyer for Robert M. Sloane, Ms. Lebov's brother-in-law and the administrator of her estate, said he believed that a partial decision in the suit earlier this summer by Judge Sherry Klein Heitler of State Supreme Court in Manhattan marked the first time that a revised version of the so-called Son of Sam law would be used to direct profits from a crime to its victims. The estate had sued Mr. Delury for profits from his book, although those proceeds amounted to less than $5,000, according to the judge's decision. ''It's not a big financial victory, but it's a moral victory. It's a victory for the Son of Sam law, and shows it can work,'' Mr. Mintz said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mintz said he thought that Mr. Delury still lived in the New York City area. There were no local phone listings for him, and he could not be reached.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lebov's family was also awarded about $1,500 toward funeral expenses. Other issues still to be resolved in the case are being sent to mediation, Mr. Mintz said.</p>
