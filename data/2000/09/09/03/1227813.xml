        <p>Aboard a giant multihull like PlayStation, Steve Fossett's otherworldly 105-foot catamaran, the anemometer, or wind-speed indicator, not only imparts invaluable information, it also serves as a reasonable guide to the emotional well-being of the boat's 12-man crew.</p>
        <p>Anything under 10 knots of wind can signal an aura of deep frustration. Numbers in the range of 15 to 30 knots are generally accompanied by a sense of profound gratification. But once the gadget registers 60 knots or more, the overall mood can range from serious concern to abject terror.</p>
        <p>The sailors aboard PlayStation have experienced the full spectrum of wind speeds and sentiments since the boat began Atlantic Ocean sea trials last December.</p>
        <p>But last week, off the coast of England in the final miles of what had started as a brilliant attempt to break the record for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic under sail, it was light air, not big breeze, that instilled the collective case of onboard ennui.</p>
        <p>After setting out from New York on Aug. 23 and maintaining a pace that would have shattered the mark of 6 days 13 hours 3 minutes, the endeavor came undone four days later when Fossett and his mates sailed into a relatively windless hole.</p>
        <p>''It's disappointing,'' said Fossett on Thursday via satellite telephone shortly after sailing into the English Channel to complete his third Atlantic crossing of the year, this one in a highly respectable time of 7 days 9 hours 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Breaking this record was our primary objective for this year. But we have a great future to look forward to because the boat is very well sorted out now.''</p>
        <p>Sailing another big cat called Jet Services, the Frenchman Serge Madec posted the current multihull mark some 10 years ago. The separate record for monohull yachts of 8 days 23 hours 59 minutes, was set in 1998 by the American businessman Robert Miller's 145-foot Mari-Cha III. At least two maxi yachts, Gianni Agnelli's Stealth and Ludde Ingvall's Skandia, had planned assaults on Miller's mark this year but abandoned the notion because of unsatisfactory forecasts.</p>
        <p>And now, after Fossett's failed run, there are no record attempts scheduled in the immediate future. So it appears both records are safe for another year. As Fossett has learned, it takes not only a fast boat also but a rare convergence of ideal weather systems to have a genuine shot at a record.</p>
        <p>PlayStation's core crew spent weeks in Manhattan's Chelsea Hotel waiting for the perfect forecast. Finally, the meteorologist Bob Rice saw what he was looking for.</p>
        <p>A cold front, accompanied by strong southerly winds, was bearing down on New York and promised a quick getaway. Out in the Atlantic, the remains of Hurricane Alberto were conspiring with a strong mid-ocean high-pressure system to pump out more stiff southerlies in the 20- to 35-knot range.</p>
        <p>''We got on a very good weather pattern and started knocking out 500 days for the first three days,'' Fossett said. ''It started to look real promising and we thought we might arrive in five-and-a-half days.'' The sweet sailing didn't last.</p>
        <p>''About 900 miles out we realized it was all going to fall apart and it degenerated into a 350-mile day followed by a day that was only a little over 100 miles,'' Fossett said. ''The weather systems tend to pile up as you approach the continent and there's a much greater vulnerability to running out of wind.''</p>
        <p>In the final stages, in the midst of a lightning storm, navigator Stan Honey got a scare when he received an electrical jolt while disconnecting instruments at his station.</p>
        <p>''He realized we were at a risk to have all our electrical systems short out and he picked up a big static charge from the lightning,'' Fossett said. ''It gave him a pretty sore arm.''</p>
        <p>It wasn't the first frightening moment aboard PlayStation, which almost pitchpoled -- or tripped end over end -- while screaming ahead of a 63-knot blast of wind on its first, aborted transatlantic record attempt last December.</p>
        <p>But Fossett believes the thousands of miles the boat and crew have since weathered will put them in good stead for coming adventures.</p>
        <p>''It's an enormously powerful boat but we're getting used to it,'' Fossett said, ''and we're getting to like that power.''</p>
        <p>In the weeks ahead, PlayStation's hulls will be stretched by 20 feet apiece to bring the boat's overall length to 125 feet.</p>
        <p>''We have too much sail area and the boat will be better balanced then,'' said Fossett. Afterwards, Fossett has entered PlayStation in The Race, the round-the-world event scheduled to begin in Barcelona, Spain on Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>But Fossett said he would wait to see the final entry list before fully committing to the event; a separate attempt at the nonstop round-the-world record of 71 days is also a possibility.</p>
        <p>''We wouldn't want to go if there were only three boats starting, for instance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''On the other hand, if there are five properly prepared boats on the line it would be very exciting. So we're going to let the other people entered make that final decision for us.''</p>
