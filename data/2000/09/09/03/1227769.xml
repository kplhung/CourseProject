        <p>When a National Football League assistant suddenly becomes a head coach, two things usually happen: First, his blood pressure skyrockets. Second, he becomes more paranoid than Richard Nixon. We don't know about the blood pressure of Mike Martz, who this off-season replaced Dick Vermeil as head coach of the Super Bowl champion St. Louis Rams, but we do know that on the paranoid scale Martz is already scoring off the chart.</p>
        <p>It's football season when the leaves start changing color, players break out the cliches, and coaches start talking about strangers on a hill possibly spying on their practice.</p>
        <p>Last week, in the middle of a Rams practice, Martz saw two people on a hillside warehouse near the practice field. Martz sent the team's security director, Dan Linza, to chase them away. Then Martz ordered Linza to walk the length of the large warehouse -- twice -- to see if anyone else was watching.</p>
        <p>''I'm paranoid, like all coaches are paranoid,'' Martz said. ''You have people watching with a notepad, or a camera, somehow it makes you paranoid.''</p>
        <p>But the paranoia did not stop there. During that same practice, a newspaper photographer took several photos of safety Keith Lyle, something even the tense Vermeil allowed. This time, the team asked the photographer to stop. When the photographer later tried to make a call on his cell phone, a Rams official threatened to take away the phone. Maybe the official was worried that the photographer's calling plan was too expensive.</p>
        <p>Then, late in the week, the Rams moved their practices from the wide-open field at Rams Park to the more secure -- and enclosed -- Trans World Dome. The team said it was because of temperatures in the mid-90's, but since when do coaches fret over players getting hot? Maybe Martz thought the Denver Broncos, the team St. Louis plays on Monday night, were using spy satellites.</p>
        <p>If there is one troublesome sign for the Rams -- and there are not very many on a team that is stacked with talent -- it is Martz's paranoia and desire to have Bill Parcells-like control of the news media. Vermeil could be uptight, but he learned how to loosen up, and his players appreciated it. If Martz loses a few games, his paranoia may only increase, and players could start to lose confidence in coaches who worry more about who is behind that bush with a boom microphone than about things that matter like, oh, the game plan.</p>
        <p>The Case of the Two People on the Hill -- sounds like a Perry Mason episode -- exemplifies the extremes some normally sane people can reach in the pressure cooker that is professional football.</p>
        <p>One team spying on another has happened, but it is rare, mainly because the secrets that can be uncovered are not really secrets. Teams know each other too well.</p>
        <p>Still, the more paranoid coaches believe spying is rampant and will go to extremes to stop it, even though it is mostly in their heads.</p>
        <p>Actually, New York is purportedly one of the more legendary spying hot spots. Giants coaches from Parcells to Dan Reeves to Jim Fassel believed at various times that opponents stashed spies in rooms at a hotel near Route 3, across from one of the Giants' practice fields. With a good pair of high-powered binoculars, a spy, theoretically, could see everything.</p>
        <p>When the Giants built a practice bubble several years ago, Reeves moved the team inside so often because of his fear of being spied on, that one player used to jokingly call the facility ''Dan's bunker.''</p>
        <p>Some teams are now even spying on themselves. The Jets have installed video cameras throughout the facility, which, the team says, help protect players and others from theft. But players believe that video cameras in the locker and weight rooms are used solely to monitor their activities and show which players speak to the news media.</p>
        <p>The Washington Redskins this summer became the first team to charge fans a $10 admission fee to watch training camp practices, and the policy kicked in a never-before-used league rule that allows scouts, normally prevented from legally watching another team's practice, to set up camp. Dozens, notepads in hand, braved the humidity to watch Washington's players.</p>
        <p>This time the spying was legal. Still, interestingly, several scouts who attended the practices said they felt they were doing something wrong.</p>
        <p>So Martz joins a long list of James Bond, spy-catching wannabes. Only Martz is not trying to protect queen and country. He just wants to make sure a bunch of football secrets, or perceived secrets, stay that way.</p>
        <p>More Johnson Analysis</p>
        <p>Yet one more annoying Keyshawn Johnson item -- and we cannot promise this will be the last.</p>
        <p>A former salary-cap consultant for the New Orleans Saints, Terry O'Neil, who in three years helped the Saints' salary-cap room grow from $11,000 to $17 million, made two interesting claims recently regarding Johnson, the former Jets star, on his new football Web site, RealNFL.com.</p>
        <p>First, O'Neil reports -- and the Jets do not deny -- that General Manager Bill Parcells tried to trade Johnson as early as 1998, in order to recoup draft picks given to New England in the Curtis Martin trade. O'Neil bases this on conversations with team executives.</p>
        <p>Second, O'Neil said the Jets could have easily fit Johnson under the team's salary cap for a measly cap number of $38,500 a season for two years without destroying the team's financial future.</p>
        <p>How? His explanation is complicated, but basically it involved paying Johnson a signing bonus two years in advance of his contract's expiration date while simultaneously lowering his base salary for this year and next. One team's salary-cap guru said O'Neil's analysis was correct.</p>
        <p>If it is, then the statements by Parcells that Johnson had to be traded for salary cap reasons are untrue. O'Neil's statements seem to bolster Johnson's claims that the true reason Parcells traded him was because the organization feared Johnson and Coach Al Groh would not get along.</p>
        <p>The Jets are not commenting on O'Neil's number crunching or his statement that the team attempted to trade Johnson two seasons ago.</p>
        <p>Leaf Watchers</p>
        <p>When San Diego quarterback Ryan Leaf starts today against Oakland, the coaches and players, will be watching for two things. Leaf has never been able to handle adversity, so the team wants to see how Leaf reacts after an interception or a sack.</p>
        <p>The Chargers will also look to see how Leaf handles pain. In the past, he has been accused of being soft, and that is an area where he has lost a tremendous amount of respect among his teammates.</p>
        <p>If players are going to trust Leaf again, they must see him take a hit, then get right back up and go on to the next play, not take himself out of the game with what players might consider minor pain.</p>
