        <p>Gold medals are showered so profusely in numberless wine competitions that they equal in value the German marks trundled to banks in wheelbarrows during the Weimar Republic.</p>
        <p>Besides, who knows how qualified the judges were and what standards and practices governed the sifting?</p>
        <p>Yet, certain wines are obvious winners. Take the charming Baron Herzog '99 chenin blanc, made in California by the Royal Wine Corporation in Brooklyn. (Incidentally, it's kosher.)</p>
        <p>This starlet, from a Loire grape that bafflingly has fallen from favor in North America, and is priced to sell nationally at $6, defeated 732 whites to win the title of best white wine of the show at the Riverside International Wine Competition in California in May.</p>
        <p>Peter Stern, Royal's winemaker in California, has a sure hand with this grape: the '98 Baron Herzog chenin blanc was voted best white wine at the 1999 West Coast Wine Competition in California.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, the ubiquitous Herzog chenin costs $7 at the Park Avenue Liquor Shop, 292 Madison Avenue (41st Street); in Queens, $8 at Rame, 69-30 Main Street (Jewel Avenue), Flushing, and $7 at Mayfair, 188-03 Union Turnpike (188th Street), Fresh Meadows; in Brooklyn, $6 at Liquor World, 1709 Voorhies%% CQ %% Avenue, Sheepshead Bay; in the Bronx, $6 at Fieldston, 3704 Riverdale Avenue (236th Street).</p>
        <p>Light as chiffon, the chenin, fresh and quaffable, is as aromatic as a summer garden. It is round and dry enough to pour as an aperitif or to wash down fish, chicken and veal. When moderately chilled, at first sip it delivers a teasingly fruity opening punch line that, as it warms up, yields to a quieter, more serious flavor narrative, with a citric nip in the long finish.</p>
        <p>Talk about bargains!</p>
