        <p>The first seven months in power have been sobering for President Stipe Mesic.</p>
        <p>He has been determined to bring Croatia into the European Union, but the economy he inherited after the death of the former president, Franjo Tudjman, is in seriously bad shape.</p>
        <p>He was elected promising an end to the nepotism and corruption of the Tudjman government. But a court system used for years as a political tool has not been strong or independent enough to prosecute the law vigorously.</p>
        <p>Worst of all, the levels of corruption Mr. Mesic has uncovered from the old government have far outstripped even his worst imaginings, running into the billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Mesic said in a recent interview, the government is even investigating family members of the late president, still honored by Croatians as the man who founded their modern state with the breakup of  Yugoslavia in the 1990's, for abuse of their position.</p>
        <p>''It needs to be accepted as criminal activity and prosecuted as such,'' Mr. Mesic said. In particular, those who profited from the privatization of the state enterprises of the old socialist economy have to be brought to justice, he said. ''Those who took advantage should answer for that and return the money that has been stolen.''</p>
        <p>Implying he was not after revenge, Mr. Mesic, a longtime opponent of the former president, said he did not want to persecute the Tudjman family per se. But, he said, some family members -- namely Mr. Tudjman's younger son, Stjepan, his daughter Nevenka Kosutic, and even his wife, Ankica -- appeared to have profited from their position and owned trust funds and companies obtained under a privatization process that was never open to public tender. A couple of cases are under investigation concerning them, he said.</p>
        <p>On the whole, he said, Mr. Tudjman's plan to create a wealthy class of 200 rich families to lead Croatia was both catastrophic and criminal.</p>
        <p>''We are not going after any family,'' he said. ''For us, as in any country, it is the individual we look for. All I can say is that no one will get an amnesty if they have done wrong.''</p>
        <p>When he took office in February, Mr. Mesic found a room full of thousands of documents and audio tapes -- apparently conversations between Mr. Tudjman and his aides and ministers -- left behind in the presidential building. The new president has readily passed those tapes on to the press.</p>
        <p>They have provided this Balkan country of four and half million people with a steady diet of sensational revelations on how Mr. Tudjman and a small inner circle ran the country.</p>
        <p>The tapes have contained everything from how Mr. Tudjman apparently discussed setting up front companies to disguise purchase of the biggest daily newspaper, Vecernji List -- and so ensure its loyalty to the regime -- to how to help an indicted war criminal evade prosecution from the international tribunal at The Hague, to discussing Mr. Tudjman's obsession with annexing the town of Banja Luka in northern Bosnia, as late as last year.</p>
        <p>This kind of openness has brought a new mood to Croatians who have welcomed an era of change under Mr. Mesic.</p>
        <p>In Dubrovnik, the picturesque coastal city that was shelled badly during the Balkans war, Mr. Mesic was dining with the Croatian water polo team before they set off on tour and then to the Olympics.</p>
        <p>''I hope for a gold,'' the 65-year-old president said, ''not because they are Croatian but because they are the best.'' It was a pointed reminder of his move away from the nationalist politics embraced to such disastrous effect by his predecessor.</p>
        <p>But although the transcripts of the tapes have made for good reading, they may be insufficient as evidence, government officials acknowledge, and despite his avowed determination, Mr. Mesic may have difficulty prosecuting individuals.</p>
        <p>The new administration has made little headway so far in bringing people to court and is learning that to prosecute the corrupt or retrieve any of the money lost is going to be a long and complex task. Presidential aides also express frustration with the government of Prime Minister Ivica Racan for working too slowly.</p>
        <p>''We are talking about billions of dollars,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Slavko Linic, who is responsible for economics and heads a commission investigating corruption.</p>
        <p>Mr. Linic, the former opposition mayor of the port town, Rijeka, said he was appalled to find just how indebted the country really was, with hundreds of state companies bankrupt and unable to pay their thousands of employees. Economists estimate between two and six billion dollars have been stolen.</p>
        <p>Despite the economic trouble, Mr. Mesic, who was elected in a landslide victory, remains quite popular. But to maintain that support, even he feels the need to deliver on his election promises to end corruption.</p>
        <p>''Popular support would be stronger if they were seen to make people accountable,'' one European diplomat said. ''These people still have their big houses in the hills and drive around in Mercedes.''</p>
        <p>The government appears to be going after businessmen first. The most notorious, Miroslav Kutle, who benefited from his job in the privatization fund, came to own over 100 companies, which he promptly embezzled. While he is now in prison, two other prominent figures detained recently by fraud investigators, have been released, apparently for lack of evidence.</p>
        <p>The newspaper Nacional has suggested they intimidated judges or bribed their way out. Mr. Linic says the investigation is continuing.</p>
        <p>These men have robbed the state twice over, Mr. Linic said. Through the privatization process, he explained, they arranged to buy some of the country's most profitable companies, pledging to pay the government back, but never doing so.</p>
        <p>They quickly ran the companies into the ground, and as they lost money the businessmen then secured bank loans, which were also never repaid, and finally government funds to keep them afloat.</p>
        <p>The government has now inherited state companies that are more indebted than ever, along with millions of dollars in outstanding government loans that have to be written off.  ''That's why the portfolio of the state is in such a bad situation, it is without value,'' Mr. Linic said.</p>
        <p>For the government, the most potent problem is the tens of thousands of state workers the government cannot pay and who face unemployment, which has already reached 20 percent. The state employees whose jobs are now threatened in the bankrupt companies represent another quarter of the work force, Mr. Linic said.</p>
        <p>''The Croatian people are very angry and they expect to see people in jail,'' he said. ''Everyone knows that some person is responsible for the economy, and they ask that the government find that person and put him in jail. And that is very important for the government, but very hard.''</p>
        <p>Chasing the money, much of which went abroad, and pursuing fraud charges is complex, he continued. Legislation written in the Tudjman era is insufficient and full of loopholes, which have already been exploited by those seeking to commit fraud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Linic has suggested three lines of action. Besides his own commission, he has called for a parliamentary commission to investigate every past privatization deal and to audit state companies, as well as a special fraud squad of untouchables to examine government departments, ministries and law enforcement agencies for internal corruption.</p>
        <p>But the commitment to fighting fraud is tempered by realism over the critical state of the economy. The government has chosen not to pursue businessmen whose companies are running a profit, however they came to own them. ''They are concentrated on the economy, and want to be forward looking, they don't want to be fixated on revenge,'' one Western diplomat said.</p>
        <p>''The government has to do 100 things at once with little experience.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, the government is also being pushed by the West on issues like allowing the return of Serbs displaced in the Bosnia war and for greater cooperation with the government in Bosnia, as well as  with the war crimes tribunal at The Hague. Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Mesic has already entered into negotiations for eventual membership in the European Union and NATO, though both are still a long way off.</p>
        <p>''They are overwhelmed,'' the diplomat added.</p>
        <p>Others warn that the government needs to show results soon, as the economic pain is only just beginning. One day recently, outside the government building on the handsome St. Mark's Square, Matko Krizanac, a 55-year-old unemployed doctor, stood holding two crumpled banners protesting the loss of his savings.</p>
        <p>''The worst thing is the helplessness,'' he said. ''The government and the justice system do not function. The government says it's been robbed, but it is incapable of fighting crime,'' he nearly shouted. ''People are already saying this government is the same as the old government.''</p>
