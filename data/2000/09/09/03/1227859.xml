        <p>In last week's episode of ''Bull,'' the Wall Street-centered drama series that had its premiere on Aug. 15 on TNT, one of the show's principals, Hunter Lasky, a takeover artist played by Stanley Tucci, explains the facts of life to Carson Boyd, a junior associate played by Christopher Wiehl.</p>
        <p>In the midst of various fiscal and emotional plot machinations, Boyd expresses moral objections to a particularly noisome greenmail scheme (a huge stock purchase meant to scare a company into buying the stock back at a premium). The older man flicks them away like lint on his bespoke suit.</p>
        <p>''Look at us, boy,'' says Lasky. ''What do we do? We don't hammer nails into wood. We don't spout the law. We don't prescribe medicines for the sick.</p>
        <p>''What do we do? We make money. That's what we do. We fill our pockets by any means necessary. And if at the end of the day we have more money than when we woke up that morning, then we've done our job.''</p>
        <p>It's an arresting short monologue, all the more because it neatly encapsulates many of the arguments against putting a show like ''Bull,''</p>
        <p>TNT's first foray into the weekly series arena, on the air.</p>
        <p>''Bull'' is centered on a coterie of mostly young, mostly attractive financial wheeler-dealers. It has long been the accepted wisdom in Hollywood, however, that only young, attractive characters engaged in altruistic enterprises -- in short, saving lives, righting wrongs or upholding the law -- will win the long-term affection of the audience.</p>
        <p>That's why most aggressive businessmen on television and in the movies are portrayed as villains (''Wall Street''), objects of satire (''Barbarians at the Gate'') or -- remember ''Dynasty''? -- one of the essential ingredients of high camp.</p>
        <p>But Michael S. Chernuchin, ''Bull's'' writer-producer, who struggled for a decade to get his brainchild on the air, feels audiences are being sold short.</p>
        <p>''Aren't we all tired of doctor, lawyer and cop shows? I know I am,'' says the 42-year old Mr. Chernuchin (pronounced CHURN-a-chin) in his office at the Warner Brothers Studio in Burbank, Calif.</p>
        <p>He cites the popularity of the ''Sopranos''' lead character, Tony Soprano, as proof that viewers will embrace less than saintly protagonists.''The man is a gangster but he's also a nice guy. So he's killed a couple of people, so what?'' he said with a grin.</p>
        <p>Primarily, though, Mr. Chernuchin feels that ''Bull'' (and, presumably, ''The Street,'' a drama with a similar theme being offered by Fox this fall) taps into something more fundamental in the American character than the current interest in stocks, bonds and I.P.O.'s.</p>
        <p>''I think my characters are pretty close to the people watching them,'' says Mr. Chernuchin. ''These guys get up in the morning, put on their suits and go to work. That is basically what they do.''</p>
        <p>He adds: ''The business of America is business. Why shouldn't we dramatize that? Why hasn't it been done?</p>
        <p>''I mean, it has been done. Arthur Miller has been doing it for years.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Chernuchin doesn't claim Mr. Miller's mastery of career-driven angst and heartbreak, he is counting on the ''David and Goliath'' underpinnings of his series.</p>
        <p>''Our basic story is about entrepreneurs, and I think I would say that 90 percent of all Americans at one time or another wanted to say 'Take this job and ...' And that is what these people do. They are talking high numbers. They can make a lot of money. They can also lose a lot.''</p>
        <p>The lead characters of ''Bull'' are also rebels of a sort. In the first episode, most of them defect en masse from a powerful and shady old-line Wall Street firm. They are led by Robert Roberts III, nicknamed Ditto (played by George Newbern), grandson of the old firm's dictatorial leader Robert Roberts (Donald Moffat), a k a the Kaiser.</p>
        <p>Roberts is joined by his buddy Corey Granville (Malik Yoba), an African-American Harvard graduate who has hit the triple-glazed glass ceiling with a thud; Marty Decker (Ian Kahn), a mergers and acquisitions specialist whose zest for his work masks his gambling addiction; Marissa Rufo (Alicia Coppola), an up-by-the-bootstraps commodities broker with hidden ties to the old neighborhood; Elisabeth Rohm (Alison Jeffers), an investment banker with a different kind of secret life; and the aforementioned Lasky and his reluctant acolyte Boyd.</p>
        <p>Initial reviews of the series have ranged from somewhat negative to enthusiastically positive. It is Mr. Chernuchin's hope that viewers will brave the potentially confusing thicket of puts and calls, hedge funds and hostile takeovers and hang in to see all the nuances of his characters' personalities revealed while they fight the vengeful Kaiser's evil empire.</p>
        <p>As for TNT, known primarily for its sports, original movies, short mini-series and ''E.R.'' reruns, it hopes that the show's contrarian content will earn it more attention from the news media and cable subscribers alike.</p>
        <p>''Television viewers aren't accustomed to coming to TNT for original series,'' says Robert DeBitetto, the network's president for original programming. ''It's important that we offer something distinctive and unique in some way. Something that will perhaps distinguish ourselves from what's on the broadcast networks.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DeBitetto says that Mr. Chernuchin somehow avoided going into shock when TNT gave the go-ahead to his proposal for ''Bull.'' Though he certainly had reason to be surprised. Mr. Chernuchin, whose television credits include ''Brooklyn South,'' ''Michael Hayes'' and six years on the staff of the NBC hit ''Law and Order,'' had been peddling the concept of ''Bull'' unsuccessfully throughout most of his tenure in Hollywood. In fact, ''Bull'' predates his writing career entirely. In the 1980's Mr. Chernuchin, a Cornell Law School graduate, worked at a major New York law firm before breaking away with three colleagues to form his own boutique firm. During that time that he also hobnobbed with several high-flying young members of the investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert, now defunct.</p>
        <p>In 1990, acting on a longstanding dream of becoming a writer, moved to Hollywood and quickly found work. He soon discovered what most television executives thought of the masters of the Wall Street universe.</p>
        <p>''Everywhere I went they told me, 'Who cares about these people?' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, even with the Dow steadily above 10,000, not everyone came to terms with the show's premise. During early production of the series, said Mr. Chernuchin, he got a curious note from a nervous TNT executive. It read, ''Why don't the characters just give away a lot of their money to charity?'''</p>
        <p>This suggestion, says Mr. Chernuchin, was never implemented. ''My note back to him was: 'O.K., tell me how much you give to charity. And that's how much they will give.' ''</p>
