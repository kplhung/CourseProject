        <p>Patricia Hattie Keim, a daughter of Virginia and Richard Keim of New York, will be married today to Peter Ward Weingard, the son of Myra and Robert Weingard of Boynton Beach, Fla. Rabbi Charles D. Lippman is to officiate at the TriBeCa Rooftop in New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Keim, 32, will keep her name professionally. She is the associate director of marketing for Simon &amp; Schuster Audio, a division of the New York publishing house. She is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania. Her father is a founder and managing partner of the Kensington Management Group, an investment management company in New York. Her mother is the director of development for the YAI/National Institute for People With Disabilities, a network of social service agencies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weingard, 32, is the marketing director for Iron Street Labs, a New York company that provides venture capital to Internet companies. He graduated from Pace University and received a master's degree in marketing from New York University. His mother retired as a kindergarten teacher at the Reuben Gittelman Hebrew Day School in New City, N.Y. His father, also retired, taught students with learning disabilities at Ossining High School in Ossining, N.Y, and was an adjunct associate professor of communication at Pace University in Pleasantville, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The couple met in 1994 during their first week of graduate school at N.Y.U. (She later dropped out.) They had a class together and took the subway home together, since they both lived on the Upper East Side, and a casual friendship developed.</p>
        <p>There was a rupture in their relationship about a year later, which they both laugh about now. ''He had invited me to a party at his house, but I thought it was just another party,'' Ms. Keim said. ''I didn't attend, because I had tickets to the premiere of 'Pocahontas' in Central Park, which were very hard to get. I didn't know that he liked me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weingard took it as a rejection. ''She didn't bother showing up, so I thought she wasn't interested,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On a weekend afternoon a year later, while he was returning from work and she was eating a frozen yogurt, they bumped into each other at Lexington Avenue and 85th Street. They chatted for about an hour, and exchanged e-mail addresses and phone numbers. A week later, they got together for dinner.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Weingard suggested they have dinner at the Mesa Grill -- the chic, hot, expensive restaurant in Chelsea -- Ms. Keim no longer had doubts about his intentions.</p>
        <p>''When he invited me there, I knew it was a date,'' she said.</p>
