        <p>Impressionism in Hartford</p>
        <p>During the early 1870's six artists gathered in Argenteuil, a suburb of Paris known for its gypsum mines that produced plaster of Paris and for pleasure boating on the Seine. There they evolved the free-wheeling style of painting known as Impressionism.</p>
        <p>An exhibition of 50 paintings of Argenteuil and its environs by Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Edouard Manet, Alfred Sisley, Gustave Caillebotte and Eugene Boudin, on loan from private collectors and major museums around the world opens on Saturday at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, remaining through Dec. 3.</p>
        <p>Monet involuntarily set the stage for symbiosis by moving to Argenteuil in 1871, where he was visited frequently by the others.</p>
        <p>A 15-minute train ride from Paris gave them an opportunity to paint together en plein air, recording bridges and boulevards, sailboats and towpaths, gardens, factories and portraits of each other and of Monet's family.</p>
        <p>The group flourished, producing a body of work substantial enough to be mounted publicly in 1874 as the first Impressionist Show, not in Paris but in Argenteuil.</p>
        <p>Advance, timed tickets are required for admission on the hour and half-hour at $17 for adults, $15 for people 60 and older and students with identification, $13 for children 6 through 17 and free for children under 6. The Atheneum is located at 600 Main Street in downtown Hartford and exhibition hours are on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday from 10:30 to 5, Thursday from 10:30 to 9, Saturday from 10 to 9 and Sunday from 10 to 6. The toll-free ticket number is (877) 600-MAIN (6246), or visit www. museumtix.com. Do not call the museum.</p>
        <p>Early Model Automobiles</p>
        <p>Saturday marks the 49th Fall Meet of the Fairfield County Region of The Horseless Carriage Club of The American and Antique Automobile Club of America. What that mouthful means is that from 10 to 4, more than 100 automoblies and motorcycles made before 1942 will be on display with their owners attired in costumes appropriate to the period of the vehicle.</p>
        <p>An automotive flea market, a banjo band, children's activities and a food tent sponsored by The Brewhouse at New England Brewing Company in Norwalk will be available all day.</p>
        <p>It all takes place on the grounds of the Lockwood-Mathews Mansion Museum, 295 West Avenue, Norwalk. Admission is $8, students and older adults $5, under 12 free. Call (203) 838-9799 for more information.</p>
