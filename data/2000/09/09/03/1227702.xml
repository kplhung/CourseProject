        <p>BROKERS, according to a Wall Street truism, prosper when the market goes up and when it goes down. But this year, the market has gone nowhere -- no major average has moved much more than 4 percent from its Dec. 31 level -- and the brokers have done better than ever.</p>
        <p>Certainly the firms' stocks have -- many of the big ones are up 30 to 85 percent this year -- and they rose further last week after the Credit Suisse Group agreed to pay $90 a share for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which was changing hands less than a year ago for $36.50 a share.

        <p>BROKERS, according to a Wall Street truism, prosper when the market goes up and when it goes down. But this year, the market has gone nowhere -- no major average has moved much more than 4 percent from its Dec. 31 level -- and the brokers have done better than ever.</p>
        <p>Certainly the firms' stocks have -- many of the big ones are up 30 to 85 percent this year -- and they rose further last week after the Credit Suisse Group agreed to pay $90 a share for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which was changing hands less than a year ago for $36.50 a share. That followed a blockbuster deal, announced in mid-July, under which PaineWebber, the fourth-biggest American brokerage firm, will be acquired by the banking group UBS.</p>
        <p>Many people on Wall Street say brokerage-firm shares, despite rich prices and a history of sharp cyclical swings, have more room to fly. A big reason, analysts say, is that they are taking business from banks in a freer regulatory landscape for which the banks themselves lobbied vigorously for decades. ''What you're seeing is a paradigm shift from banks to brokers,'' said Meredith Whitney, senior financial services analyst at First Union Securities.</p>
        <p>Or, as Henry McVey of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter put it, the brokers are ''winning the land grab.''</p>
        <p>Not only are brokerage firms making more inroads into traditional banking territory than the banks are making into the securities business, but they are also seen by analysts as ''cleaner'' financial plays. There are no bad loans to write off, for example.</p>
        <p>Stocks of brokerage firms are also benefiting from favorable demographics. Only about half the baby-boom generation has reached the prime stock-owning years.</p>
        <p>Then there is greatly expanded opportunity in Europe, where a unified market and the euro are spurring mergers. According to Guy Moszkowski of Salomon Smith Barney, a looming crisis in European governmental pension systems means that employers are investing more in securities. Individual Europeans, moreover, are only now migrating in large numbers to equities from bonds and bank deposits.</p>
        <p>Another factor is the seasonal lift that brokerage firms' stocks often receive in anticipation of their strongest periods of the year, the fourth and first calendar quarters. The list of stock underwritings this fall, initial and secondary alike, is building rapidly, although seasonal and cyclical swings have become hard to disentangle, Mr. Moszkowski cautioned.</p>
        <p>But Steven Eisman, financial services analyst at CIBC World Markets, said the fundamentals ''are still really good; much better than for the banks.''</p>
        <p>''We're recommending them all,'' Mr. Eisman added, despite historically high price-to-earnings multiples that include at least some premium for the possibility that a suitor will make a buyout bid.</p>
        <p>Analysts express little concern that decimalization, trading in cents instead of fractions of a dollar, will do much damage to the firms. The gap between bid and asked prices will no doubt narrow, shrinking trading profits, but they say this will probably be offset by expanded volume. ''Over all, it's neutral to positive'' for the industry, said Lauren A. Smith, who analyzes brokerage firms for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods.</p>
        <p>Still, prices are steep. J. P. Morgan, which had a big run-up of 11.1 percent last week, Lehman Brothers and Chase Manhattan were reported to have expressed interest in Donaldson, Lufkin before it went to Credit Suisse for three times book value. Traditionally, Ms. Smith said, ''you buy brokers at book and sell them at two times book,'' a rule of thumb that may soon be forgotten, given where some industry kingpins are trading. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is at 6.9 times book value, and Charles Schwab at 13.7 times.</p>
        <p>With Donaldson, Lufkin spoken for, in effect swapping one European parent -- AXA -- for another, the spotlight has been aimed more intensely at Lehman Brothers, up 76 percent this year, and Bear Stearns, up 64 percent; both have relatively modest price-to-earnings ratios of about 12.</p>
        <p>Analysts say Lehman, which is now expected to earn $12 a share in 2000, compared with $7.70 when the year began, is enjoying strong business and is equipped to compete on its own with Goldman Sachs and the other giants if it chooses. Mr. Eisman rates it a ''strong buy,'' and Mr. Moszkowski said it could rise an additional 20 percent, along with Goldman and Merrill Lynch, over the next 6 to 12 months.</p>
        <p>Bear Stearns, very strong in securities processing and trading but weak in asset management and stock underwriting, has said it will consider selling at $120 a share, or four times book value, a rich price indeed. And some suggest that its fiercely competitive, independent culture would pose severe integration challenges for an acquirer.</p>
        <p>MR. MOSZKOWSKI considers the fast-growing Charles Schwab, trading at a lofty 57 times earnings, ''pretty fully valued,'' and Morgan Stanley, at 21 times earnings, ''fairly valued.'' As for leading regional firms, he said valuations for Legg Mason of Baltimore and A. G. Edwards of St. Louis ''are not particularly outrageous,'' despite sharp run-ups.</p>
        <p>''We're clearly dealing with outsize returns, but right now there's little to rock the boat,'' said Mr. McVey, noting that the Federal Reserve has now had two policy meetings without further raising interest rates. But he warned of a potential double jolt if the investment climate changed and if profits, which face tough-to-beat comparisons with the first half of 2000, came up short next year. ''There's always the risk'' with this group, he said, ''of earnings and multiple compression at the same time.''</p>
