        <p>For years, the woman heard the moaning of animals. Finally last month she could not stand it any more.</p>
        <p>She called a newspaper to report that a restaurant nearby was keeping three black bears in tiny cages, milking their gall bladders of bile to sell for its reputed medicinal value.</p>
        <p>After a sensational account in The Beijing Morning Post of Aug. 12, officers of the Beijing Forestry Bureau raided the restaurant, to the south of Beijing. They hauled the bears to the Beijing Wildlife Rescue Center and began a criminal investigation of the restaurant owners, who did not have a permit to keep bears in captivity.</p>
        <p>The bears are still recovering from their ordeal and may wind up in a special reserve or a zoo, in an episode that reflects changing attitudes about animal welfare among China's emerging middle class.</p>
        <p>Six months ago, the Beijing municipality (which includes large rural areas surrounding the dense city) did not have a wild animal rehabilitation center, a result of budget problems as well as a traditional lack of concern many Chinese have toward other species.</p>
        <p>The new center has been financed as a public service by a private handicrafts company, but operates under the authority of the Beijing Forestry Bureau. It takes in injured animals like hawks as well as valuable birds or reptiles seized from wildlife smugglers.</p>
        <p>The center, which has only been operating since May, has been almost overwhelmed by the demand for its services. ''Public awareness about wildlife protection is rising, and more people are reporting injured animals,'' said Chen Shu, the center's manager, ''but we never expected bears.''</p>
        <p>The travails of the three black bears also set off renewed debate about the practice of bear farming for bile, which Chinese authorities have promoted as the best way to combat poaching of wild bears to supply the market.</p>
        <p>One of the bears recovered was found to have a tube dangling from an open sore; its other end was inside the animal's gall bladder. After being taken to the Beijing Wildlife Rescue Center, a specially experienced foreign veterinarian was invited in to remove the tube.</p>
        <p>Traditional Asian medicine holds that bear bile can help treat a variety of maladies, from eye disease to hepatitis to cancer. Less formally, bile products are sold as general enhancers of health.</p>
        <p>In the past, large numbers of wild bears were killed for their gall bladders and other products. But in recent decades, as the government outlawed such killings, it encouraged bear farms as a substitute. In the 1980's, thousands of bears were captured and today 7,000 bears are kept on 247 licensed bear farms where they are bred and tapped for bile.</p>
        <p>Chinese officials defend bear-bile farming as the safest way to meet the demand. ''If one bear on a farm produces bile for 10 years, then the lives of 400 wild bears will be saved,'' said Fang Zhiyong, a senior wildlife official, in a recent newspaper interview.</p>
        <p>In the early 90's, the International Fund for Animal Welfare publicized the abysmal conditions on some farms, where bears with long festering sores were locked in tiny cages, and Chinese officials have acknowledged that some farms are substandard.</p>
        <p>This summer, China signed an agreement with the Animals Asia Foundation, a private group based in Hong Kong, under which many smaller and poorly run farms in southern China will be closed. In the next five years, 500 bears will be released to a natural reserve to be run by the foundation in Sichuan province.</p>
        <p>Officials pledged to reduce bear farming further over the next 15 years, with a long-term goal of ending the practice. But they pointedly said it would not be outlawed so long as there is market demand. They also insist that well-regulated, large farms can offer more humane living conditions and methods of bile extraction.</p>
        <p>Wildlife advocates take heart in signs of changing public attitudes about animal welfare, and evidence that fewer medical practitioners prescribe bile.</p>
        <p>''The demand for bile has dropped and the price is going down,'' said Grace Ge Gabriel, head of the Beijing office of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. The group is now working with traditional medical practitioners around Asia to promote herbal and synthetic alternatives to bile.</p>
