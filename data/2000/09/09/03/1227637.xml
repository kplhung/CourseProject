        <p>Re: ''The Brave, and Now the Few'' [Aug. 27]. Yes, it's imperative that we sustain membership in volunteer fire departments to ensure protection.</p>
        <p>To help readers understand why nearly 20,000 Long Islanders do proudly volunteer: it feels good. Volunteers agree that serving entails sacrifice of time, but serving also yields unexpected, heartwarming rewards. Like a toddler reciting perfectly what to do in case of fire and how to practice what to do at home.  Or accepting thanks while standing amid unscathed family heirlooms after the blaze in the adjoining garage was extinguished in minutes.</p>

        <p>To help readers understand why nearly 20,000 Long Islanders do proudly volunteer: it feels good. Volunteers agree that serving entails sacrifice of time, but serving also yields unexpected, heartwarming rewards. Like a toddler reciting perfectly what to do in case of fire and how to practice what to do at home.  Or accepting thanks while standing amid unscathed family heirlooms after the blaze in the adjoining garage was extinguished in minutes.</p>
        <p>Volunteering is a means to live by example. The inconvenience of dinners interrupted by alarms can also demonstrate community service values to kids. The intensity in kids' eyes as they ask what we did to help during an alarm underscores the merit of volunteering.</p>
        <p>Fulfillment vastly outweighs the training requirements, which over a year can average four to six hours a week. It feels good to know that volunteer community service is not an anachronism. Volunteerism continues today and can grow by valuing these rewards.</p>
