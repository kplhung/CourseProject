        <p>Tracie Martyn, a facialist whose mild, electric ''noninvasive face-lift'' technique is sought by Susan Sarandon, Donna Karan and many models, opened on lower Fifth Avenue almost a year ago. The spa's phone number is unlisted, and the only sign of its existence is a buzzer that reads ''T. Martyn.'' The rooms, designed to feel like a cozy apartment, are never frequented by more than two clients at a time. Tracie Martyn is one of a handful of secluded salons around town that are run more like exclusive supper clubs. They are known only to fashion insiders and celebrities who value attractions like no six-month waiting lists and plenty of privacy.</p>
        <p>Suite 303, at right, is a salon on the third floor of the Chelsea Hotel that caters mostly to the fashion and music industries. The salon, a former hotel suite, carries its own line of hair products, called Secret Professional, naturally. The actor Matthew Modine, who gets his hair cut at Suite 303 and is also a fan of Tracie Martyn, prefers these hidden locales. ''It's not like going to a salon,'' he said. ''It's like going over to someone's house and you just happen to get your hair cut while you're there.''</p>

        <p>Larry Costa, once an actor on ''Miami Vice,'' now owner of the Life Is Beautiful salon, tucked away on the fourth floor of 177 Prince Street in SoHo, would agree. Here, massages and facials are given on rose-covered treatment beds and the lounge is set up like a Southern grandmother's living room, complete with wine and meringue pastries. Glow Skin Spa, on the 12th floor of the Fuller Building, sandwiched between Prada and Coach on 57th Street, is the hush-hush  home of the facialist Jillian Ratensperger. Why keep such a low-profile? ''I never want to be an assembly line,'' she said.</p>
