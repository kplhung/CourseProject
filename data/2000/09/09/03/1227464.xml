        <p>A few years back, I was convicted of assault, a felony. I was in college and had been drinking. I've since moved on to the professional world and, to secure my last two corporate jobs, I had to lie on my application regarding my criminal history. I hate the daily anxiety of being discovered but believe I had no recourse. What should I do? -- Anonymous</p>
        <p>You should think about fessing up. Your crime is an old one and is unrelated to your current job, where you've had a chance to show your merit. Many people are forgiving of youthful wrongdoing, particularly if you appeal to them forthrightly. It is more honorable (and less uncomfortable) to volunteer your history than to wait fearfully for your boss to discover it. And by doing so, you can present your story in the most favorable light.</p>

        <p>A few years back, I was convicted of assault, a felony. I was in college and had been drinking.

        <p>You should think about fessing up. Your crime is an old one and is unrelated to your current job, where you've had a chance to show your merit. Many people are forgiving of youthful wrongdoing, particularly if you appeal to them forthrightly. It is more honorable (and less uncomfortable) to volunteer your history than to wait fearfully for your boss to discover it. And by doing so, you can present your story in the most favorable light.</p>
        <p>What you should not have done is lie on a job application. While an employer may not probe every aspect of your life -- your religious views, your sexual habits -- he or she may legitimately ask certain questions, and you must answer honestly. That there may be a price for your candor does not lessen this obligation.</p>
        <p>You may have more recourse than you realize. You can apply for a ''Relief from Civil Disabilities'' certificate, notes Deborah A. Scalise, an assistant attorney general in New York State who frequently lectures on legal ethics. ''While a felony conviction can never be expunged from the record,'' says Scalise,the certificate prevents an outright forfeiture of a position.'' Your boss would not be able simply to fire you upon learning about your conviction. Instead, you'd have the right to argue in a hearing that your youthful misdeed does not diminish your ability to do your job. Of course, the boss still gets the final word on your continued employment, but at least you get a measure of due process. To obtain the certificate, you have to persuade a judge that you have not been convicted of a felony more than once and that you have been rehabilitated.</p>
        <p>Such laws differ from state to state, so you should talk to a lawyer to see how you can come clean without putting yourself in more peril. While your situation is grave, it is not apt to be fatal: you are not Jean Valjean, and your boss is not Javert.</p>
        <p>I bought a $70 sweatshirt on sale for $30. It was very fashionable, and one of the most comfortable articles of clothing I wore. I lent it to a friend of mine, and the next day she claimed it disappeared. How much money should I ask her for, $30 or $70?</p>
        <p>-- M. Pavlovsky, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>I'm a replacement-cost kind of guy myself. But I add this qualification: if your friend wants to replace the actual sweatshirt, she's free to get one however inexpensively she can. If you intend to replace it, she should give you enough money to do so. But if you've had your fun with it and do not intend to replace it, then she should give you only the $30 you were out of pocket. Any of these approaches will restore you to your original preloss state. I can't help asking, though: $70?! For a sweatshirt?!</p>
        <p>I am a sales rep for a fine-wine distributor. One local wine shop requires his distributor reps to work in his store. Customers who ask for suggestions are usually helped by a rep who often recommends a wine he distributes. Isn't this a conflict of interest?</p>
        <p>-- Anonymous, Minneapolis</p>
        <p>I quite agree. If the customers assume they're receiving unbiased advice, they're being deceived. Perhaps that explains how, a few years ago, I ended up serving my guests poached salmon accompanied by a chilled glass of maple syrup. (But I really should have been put on my guard by the Log Cabin logo on the salesclerk's shirt.)</p>
