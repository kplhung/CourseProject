        <p>The End of the Past</p>
        <p>Ancient Rome and the Modern West.</p>
        <p>By Aldo Schiavone.</p>
        <p>Harvard University, $45.</p>
        <p>Modern history begins with the Renaissance, a period that thought of itself as bringing back to life the classical culture nearly extinguished during the Dark and Middle Ages. But why this near-death experience of a civilization that by the second century A.D. had established over a wide swath of Europe, Africa and Asia a hitherto unknown degree of political organization and economic integration? Why did the Roman Empire decline and fall instead of developing into some version of the world as we know it? This is the question Aldo Schiavone, a professor of Roman law at the University of Florence, asks, and answers, in this fascinating book. War, the founding virtue of the Roman Republic, became the engine of imperial wealth. While most people lived in rural poverty, military conquest supplied the urban elite with tribute, land and millions of slaves. Trade, a seemingly modern element, rested on slave labor, incompatible with a generalized market economy. The association of work with slavery transformed the aristocratic disdain for labor into an inability even to think about improving productivity. The system could therefore grow only until its expenses overwhelmed the flow of booty. The result, Schiavone argues in prose both readable and learned (smoothly translated from the Italian by Margery J. Schneider), was an institutional and intellectual gulf between the ancient and modern worlds so deep that it took a catastrophe -- the fall of Rome -- to pass from one to the other.</p>
