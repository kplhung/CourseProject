        <p>A fast-ferry company and a recreational fisherman's club are squaring off over who will use a $6 million city Parks Department pier.</p>
        <p>The pier, which is planned for recreational fishing, is scheduled to be built by 2002 near Midland Avenue and Father Capodanno Boulevard, on the eastern shore of Staten Island. But Arthur Imperatore Jr., president of New York Waterway, recently met with public officials to discuss redesigning part of the T-shaped pier for use as the terminus of a fast-ferry linking Manhattan to the middle of the borough. Mr. Imperatore's company runs 12 ferry lines in the harbor.</p>
        <p>He said that for a fare of $7 to $9, commuters could travel by fast ferry to lower Manhattan in 25 minutes, and to Midtown 10 minutes later. Currently, the commute by car or bus from the middle or southern end of the island entails crawling through traffic for one or two hours each way.</p>
        <p>''There is no reason that a fishing pier can't be made accessible to ferries at little or no disruption to recreational uses,'' Mr. Imperatore said.</p>
        <p>But Jack Latanzio, secretary and former president of the Staten Island Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs, said ferries and fishing do not mix. He added that the pier would sit in a part of Lower New York Bay with strong tidal flows and shifting sands.</p>
        <p>''A storm can cause a shift in a sandbar overnight,'' he said, which could grind a ferry to a halt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Imperatore said his company had not yet studied conditions at the site, but noted that the company's catamaran ferry could operate in only four feet of water.</p>
        <p>Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said that ''in principle'' he favored using part of the pier for ferries.</p>
        <p>''One would think that with a 750-foot pier, there would be someplace for a little old ferry boat to tie up without frightening the fish,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern added that the Staten Island borough president, Guy V. Molinari, who put up some of the money for the pier, should have a large say in deciding the issue. Mr. Molinari declined comment.</p>
