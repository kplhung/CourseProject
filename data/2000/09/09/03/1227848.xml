        <p>Donald Trump handed John McEnroe a letter on Friday that contained a proposal for McEnroe, the 41-year-old Hall of Fame player, to meet Venus or Serena Williams in a $1 million winner-take-all match at his Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>''I wrote a letter to my dear friend John, making him the offer,'' said Trump, who was perched in his luxury box at Arthur Ashe Stadium yesterday, taking in Anna Kournikova's match against Justine Henin at the United States Open. ''I have not heard back from him, but I think it would be a great event, great for the game and very exciting.''</p>

        <p>Donald Trump handed John McEnroe a letter on Friday that contained a proposal for McEnroe, the 41-year-old Hall of Fame player, to meet Venus or Serena Williams in a $1 million winner-take-all match at his Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>''I wrote a letter to my dear friend John, making him the offer,'' said Trump, who was perched in his luxury box at Arthur Ashe Stadium yesterday, taking in Anna Kournikova's match against Justine Henin at the United States Open. ''I have not heard back from him, but I think it would be a great event, great for the game and very exciting.''</p>
        <p>McEnroe, an analyst for CBS and the USA Network, was not available for comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Richard Williams, the father of Venus and Serena, said, ''We're not interested.''</p>
        <p>McEnroe's comments in The New Yorker created a stir last week.</p>
        <p>When the issue of the Williams sisters' dominance came up, McEnroe was quoted as saying that any male college player or senior tour member could beat Venus or Serena Williams.</p>
        <p>There seems little reason for the Williams sisters to participate in such an event. They are wealthy, and times have changed. When Billie Jean King defeated Bobby Riggs at the Houston Astrodome in 1973 -- the event drew a television audience of 90 million -- it was a statement for equality. Now, the women's tour is healthier than the men's.</p>
        <p>Throughout the week, Venus and Serena Williams handled the situation with good humor.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if I could fit him in my schedule right now,'' Venus Williams said when asked after one of her matches about a potential match with McEnroe. ''I don't think it's fair to put a 20-year-old against a 40-something person. So, I'll let that pass.''</p>
