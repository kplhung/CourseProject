        <p>Ed Ravin letter on August 13 article holds articulated buses do not work well on narrow Bronx streets (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Some 23rd Street Riders Giving Buses That Bend a Stiff Reception'' (Aug. 13), a Transit Authority spokesman claims that the 60-foot-long articulated buses are successful in the Bronx on wide boulevards like the Grand Concourse.</p>
        <p>I suspect that the Transit Authority's definition of ''success'' is the lowered expense of paying fewer drivers when they switch to the articulated buses and cut the number of buses on a route. But as far as the passengers in the Bronx are concerned, the long buses are providing bad service. The longer buses are more difficult to navigate through traffic-filled streets. Turns take longer, pulling into and out of bus stops takes longer, and the buses are more easily delayed by cars that block bus stops.</p>

        <p>The Grand Concourse is wide, but the two service roads that the buses use have only two travel lanes or less. And the Bx1 travels not only on the Concourse but also on the narrow, winding streets of Kingsbridge Heights, where one illegally parked car can prevent the long buses from making their turns.</p>
