        <p>Revelers at the West Indian American Carnival Parade tomorrow will accept, although grudgingly, a ban on alcohol at their festivities, organizers say.</p>
        <p>And the New York City Police Department, to enforce the restrictions, will increase its presence there.</p>
        <p>''We are not happy, but we are going along,'' said Carlos Lezama, president of the West Indian American Day Carnival Association, ''because we are Caribbeanites and Caribbeanites are law-abiding citizens.''</p>
        <p>The parade, along Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, is one of the most popular ethnic celebrations in New York City, drawing roughly 2 million people each Labor Day. But preparations have been peppered with unpleasantness in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Early last month, the city announced a ban on alcohol sales at all outdoor festivals, including parades, restrictions that have been in effect at the St. Patrick's Day Parade in Manhattan for years. This angered West Indian American Carnival Parade organizers, who said such a ban would cause many of their sponsors to drop out.</p>
        <p>Their anger increased when the city backed down somewhat on that ban, saying that the Feast of San Gennaro, an 11-day festival in Little Italy that starts later this month, would be allowed to sell alcohol, although with a reduced number of vendors. It is not yet clear how the city will handle restrictions on alcohol at subsequent festivals.</p>
        <p>Parade and community leaders contended that the inconsistency was unfair and strongly hinted that race played a role in the policy decision, a charge Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani firmly denied. The ban on alcohol was largely inspired by the disorder following the National Puerto Rican Day Parade in June, when more than 50 women were sexually attacked.</p>
        <p>''I think it is tunnel vision enforcement of what may be a good provision,'' said Representative Major J. Owens, a Brooklyn Democrat. ''The community thinks it is being unfairly treated, but everyone is ready to cooperate. What matters is that the festival be preserved.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the alcohol ban, myriad other safety-related changes that will probably be less visible to spectators were ordered by the city. Mayor Giuliani ordered some of the changes after two 11-year-olds and an 18-year-old man were killed at the parade last year. The children were hit by a supply van that lurched out of control and pinned them against a sound truck. The man was killed hours later, when he backed away from a snake held by a spectator and was crushed by a truck after a piece of his clothing got caught in one of its wheels.</p>
        <p>Parade organizers and city officials agreed to a number of provisions to improve safety. Floats are supposed to be modified to give drivers better visibility, and police officers will be assigned to cars and sound trucks to control spacing between the floats. Everything on wheels will require authorization.</p>
        <p>The list goes on: wheel covers are required for trucks and floats, animals like snakes that might frighten spectators will not be permitted, and the number of vendors will be restricted to curtail overcrowding. Spectators will be asked not to dance randomly in the streets or to board floats that are in motion.</p>
        <p>Chief of Department Joseph J. Esposito said the police detail would be ''adequately increased because there are more things to do now,'' but declined to give details.</p>
        <p>Community leaders said that while the ban on alcohol would not dampen the fun of the parade, which runs along Eastern Parkway from Utica Avenue to Grand Army Plaza, it did make the economics of the event trickier.</p>
        <p>''This carnival brings in resources to the city of New York,'' said Una Clarke, a city councilwoman from Brooklyn. ''So it needs more government support, which should subsidize part of the expense so band leaders and costume makers would be able to get the material they need and not spend September doing parties that include the sale of alcohol. And the fact is they have sponsors who also sell alcohol that want to know that there is a return on their investment in promoting it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Clarke stopped short of criticizing City Hall. ''I am an elected leader in the community and have to display accountability,'' she said. ''I don't have to hit the mayor over his head for everything that is done.''</p>
        <p>Another point of tension that did not directly involve the city emerged when members of three steel-drum bands planning to compete for prize money during events leading up to the parade were evicted from their practice site late last month.</p>
        <p>The landlord of the building housing a warehouse on Parkside Avenue in Brooklyn said the groups had not paid rent to store their equipment and practice there, and the bands have since taken to the streets, where they have also been sleeping,  to guard their instruments.</p>
