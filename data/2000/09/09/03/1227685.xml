        <p>From hairdressers to dog trainers, every profession has its fame specialists. Now, Richard Farnabe of Lotus, the meat-packing district's supper club-of-the-month, is emerging as a chef-to-the-stars -- and he has the writing on the wall to prove it. Since the club opened last June, the owners, David Rabin and Will Regan (of Rex club), along with Jeffrey Jah and Mark Baker (of Buddha Bar), have assiduously escorted various luminaries back to the kitchen, where Mr. Farnabe asks them to autograph a white tile wall with a permanent black Magic Marker. Mr. Farnabe got the idea when working at Daniel, where celebrity autographs are collected in a gold book. ''So, when we opened Lotus, I decided to invite celebrities to sign my wall,'' he said. ''I wanted to create a memory, for not just the crew and the restaurant staff, but for the kitchen itself.'' So far, the list includes Elle MacPherson, Mick Jagger, Serena Williams and Giorgio Armani. Mr. Farnabe says he can fit about a hundred more names on the wall, then he plans to preserve it with a large sheet of glass. Mr. Farnabe's own signature? A paupiette of John Dory fish with foie gras and chanterelles in a spicy sherry reduction.</p>
