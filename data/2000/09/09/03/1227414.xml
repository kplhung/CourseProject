        <p>Overreaching is an occupational hazard for science fiction writers, who regularly create -- and destroy -- societies, worlds, entire universes. BRAIN PLAGUE (Tor/Tom Doherty, $24.95), by Joan Slonczewski, is a case in point. The underlying premise, borrowed from Slonczewski's 1998 novel ''The Children Star,'' is immediately appealing: sentient one-celled creatures called micros can exist symbiotically within human skulls. Peering out through our eyes, communicating with us via flashes of light, colonies of micros can boost a person's brainpower or, by releasing addictive doses of neurotransmitter, seize control of their host.</p>
        <p>Working out the relationship between Chrysoberyl of Dolomoth, a young artist known to her friends as Chrys, and her headful of rambunctious symbionts should be challenge enough, especially considering the disparities in subjective time scales: an hour for the human host equals a year for the microscopic indwellers. Slonczewski, a biologist, neatly explains how creatures so small can achieve human-size intelligence: whereas our neuronal synapses comprise ''about a trillion logic gates,'' each micro boasts ''10 times that number of molecular gates.''</p>
        <p>But Slonczewski is less successful when she ventures beyond her expertise. Her depiction of the art world that Chrys inhabits, from bohemian friends and rivals to wealthy and powerful collectors, is pallid. Her heroine's melodramatic encounters with rogue micros and their burned-out hosts are unpersuasive. And her half-hearted attempts at drawing analogies between micro-host interactions and human power relationships yield little more than one-liners. While most micro colonies treat their hosts as gods to be served, a few rebels want to reverse the equation: ''All talk of gods,'' says one rabble-rouser, ''is the people's cocaine.'' A more traditional micro prophet offers her people ''Laws of Righteousness, for all to follow, numbering 613,'' a jokey reference to the 600-plus commandments that Orthodox Jews must follow. Trying to do too much, Slonczewski wastes a fine opportunity to explore, in a coherent manner, a premise that innovations in microcircuitry may soon remove from the realm of fiction: What if we could enhance our intelligence by surrendering some control over our own brains? How might this alter our concept of ''identity''? Given the complexities of neurochemistry and the structure of the nervous system, are we, even as constituted by nature, masters of our mental domain?</p>
        <p>THE COLLAPSIUM (Del Rey, $24.95), by Wil McCarthy, cheerfully embraces overreaching as its theme. Its hero, Bruno de Towaji, is smart and sexy -- a brooding supergenius who combines the most estimable qualities of Albert Einstein, Sherlock Holmes and Marlon Brando. Of course, he is a postmodern construct -- a conscious throwback to the scientist-heroes of early 20th-century science fiction, who defeated evil and won the girl with weapons they whipped up in the laboratory on a moment's notice.</p>
        <p>Set in a far-future society that has all but conquered death and distance, the story pits Bruno against a mysterious villain whose control of the forces of nature is almost equal to his own. McCarthy himself is a former rocket scientist who now devotes his energies to developing ''commercial robotics.'' He studs his narrative with far-out scientific concepts that he defends in a series of appendices with titles like ''Semisafe Black Holes'' and ''Defeating Inertia.'' He certainly has a sense of humor. Bruno's solar system is governed by a constitutional monarch named Tamra Lutui, who was given the job after humans, realizing that their brains are ''wired for monarchy,'' drafted the earth's last remaining royal, who just happened to be the Queen of Tonga.</p>
        <p>Readers who tire of this kind of whimsy can always contemplate the next in a series of wondrous scientific breakthroughs, all of which have unexpected consequences -- as when the technology of faxing people makes possible multiple murders of the same victim. Bruno, who solves these and other crimes and saves the sun from certain destruction, is surely speaking for his creator when he assures another character, ''Imagination really is the only limit.''</p>
        <p>In SISTER EMILY'S LIGHTSHIP: And Other Stories (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95), Jane Yolen recycles a grab bag of old myths, fairy tales and other stories of imagination, giving each a distinctive twist. Her sources range from the Greeks to the Brothers Grimm to O. Henry. She changes locales, invents new characters, modernizes diction. Sometimes the results are memorable, as in her rendition of the Rumpelstiltskin story as the tragic tale of an anti-Semitic pogrom in 19th-century Russia. Often she rings feminist changes, as in her retelling of ''Peter Pan'' from Wendy's point of view (actually, a whole pack of Wendys, who are determined not to take it anymore).</p>
        <p>To overcome the reader's resistance to such sleights of hand, she repeatedly resorts to direct address: ''If Granny Rumple's story sounds a bit like another you have heard, I am not surprised.'' ''Now I grant you that it is unnerving . . .'' ''Once upon a time -- I say that up front so you will know this is a fairy tale. . . .'' This can become wearing, like watching a magician who invites you once too often to see for yourself that there is nothing up her sleeves. Perhaps it is significant that the title story, the best in the book, is told by a quietly confident third-person narrator. Instead of reworking an old narrative, Yolen uses a classic science fiction theme to pinpoint the moment when a famous poet -- the Emily of the title -- accepts her difficult and lonely calling.</p>
        <p>THE PERSEIDS: And Other Stories (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95) is Robert Charles Wilson's first short-story collection. A master of the intelligent suspense novel (''The Divide,'' ''The Harvest,'' ''Mysterium''), Wilson leans to urban horror in the short form. His protagonists are all lovers of some kind. In pursuit of their obsessions, they fail to see the ground beneath them shifting, the trap closing, the last train to sanity pulling out. ''I was afraid to look through certain lenses for fear of what might be looking back,'' says the narrator of the title story, before giving in to the impulse. In Wilson's world, too much knowledge is the dangerous thing. For my taste, the most haunting story is ''The Observer,'' in which a young girl and the famous astronomer Edwin Hubble together confront mysteries of the universe invisible through even the largest telescope. ''My eyes are open,'' the girl says, ''and I am not afraid.''</p>
