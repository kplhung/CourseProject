        <p>ONE of the state's richest autumn traditions is watching a football game at the Yale Bowl. It's a tradition that has changed very little since 1914 when the Bowl opened to 71,000 fans eager to see the Yale-Harvard game.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, numerous reasons why crowds -- 52,484 at last year's Harvard game -- flock to New Haven when Yale plays a home game. It's easily accessible; the price is reasonable and there is a family atmosphere. The primary reason, however, is the Yale Bowl itself.</p>
        <p>''It's a beautiful facility,'' said Tom Beckett, Yale's director of athletics. ''There's not a bad seat in the house. When you walk through the portal at the end zone or the 20-yard line, it takes your breath away.''</p>
        <p>Carmen Cozza, who walked the sideline from 1965 to 1996 as Yale's head coach, said he was awestruck when he first entered the stadium.</p>
        <p>''It's still amazing to me how its design holds up,'' he said, adding: ''They knew what they were doing when they designed it. I've never saw standing water on that field.''</p>
        <p>When the Yale Bowl opened 86 autumns ago, it was considered an architectural wonder.</p>
        <p>It's older than the Rose Bowl and Yankee Stadium. With its initial capacity of 70,869 (64,269 since a recent renovation), it was the biggest sports venue in the country. Innovative for its time, half the structure and the playing field are below street level. There are no pillars or posts to obstruct the view.</p>
        <p>''The University of Michigan copied us,'' said Cozza, now a Yale football broadcaster on New Haven radio station WELI. ''The Rose Bowl too.''</p>
        <p>One thing that has kept crowds returning to the Bowl is Yale's winning football tradition. Historians say that American football was born at Yale. Walter Camp, one of Yale's first players and its first coach, is called the ''father of football.'' Since Yale played its first football game in 1872, the team has collected more victories -- 799 entering this season -- than any other college team. Players like Pudge Heffelfinger, Frank Hinkey, Clint Frank, Larry Kelley, Levi Jackson and Mike Pyle built a fabled history.</p>
        <p>The Bowl holds many vivid memories. Older fans still talk about how Albie Booth, the 5-foot-7-inch, 144-pound freshman, ran circles around the powerful Army team in 1929. Or how Brian Dowling and Calvin Hill led Yale to an undefeated season in 1967 with a last-minute victory over Harvard. There was also Dick Jauron's 87-yard run for the winning touchdown in the closing seconds of the 1972 Columbia game.</p>
        <p>Last year's team added yet another chapter when the quarterback Joe Walland rose from his hospital bed to beat a pesky flu and peskier Harvard team with a touchdown pass that barely met Eric Johnson's finger tips with 29 seconds to play. The victory gave Yale a share of the Ivy League crown, its first since 1989.</p>
        <p>Yale, as a member of the Ivy League, is one of the few National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I-AA teams that does not offer athletic scholarships. Unlike many larger college football programs, Yale's players almost all leave with a degree. ''Yale football is one of the great stories of college sports,'' said Beckett, who came to Yale in 1994.</p>
        <p>Yale's head coach, Jack Siedlecki, knew of Yale's football tradition long before taking the helm in 1996. ''My Dad was a football coach, so I had an idea,'' he said. ''Still, you never know until you're here.''</p>
        <p>Cozza, who has more victories than any other Yale coach with 179, said, ''you feel the tradition when you walk into the Bowl.''</p>
        <p>''For those of us who are or were a part of it,'' he said, ''it's an extremely special thing in your life.''</p>
        <p>The fans greatest contribution to that tradition is tailgating. Yalies have made a fine art of the pre-game nosh and toddy, loading up their cars with fine china, linen napkins and folding tables and chairs.</p>
        <p>Yale opens some of its surrounding athletic fields to make room for the tailgaters. By 10 a.m. the serious ones have already fired up their grills and poured their Bloody Marys, while the children toss the ball around or watch a neighboring soccer game. Most of them make it inside the Bowl for the game by halftime.</p>
        <p>''Tailgating was new to me when I came here from the Midwest,'' Cozza said. ''Some people come down here the night before to set up. And they really go all out. I've seen some bring candelabra.'' Attendance at Yale football games is on an upswing after a 10-year dry patch.</p>
        <p>Though the Bowl has held crowds of more than 70,000 on 20 occasions, the last was back in 1983, for the 100th anniversary of the Yale-Harvard game. The average attendance dropped from 41,281 in 1967 to 15,093 in 1997 (both years when the Harvard game was at home).</p>
        <p>''We used to be on television, which gave us credibility,'' Cozza said. ''And the cost of tuition almost priced us out of the middle-class students, so the Calvin Hills could no longer afford to come here. But Tom has really brought people back.''</p>
        <p>Under Beckett's marketing strategy, the average crowd was up to 27,518 last season, including 52,484 from the Harvard game.</p>
        <p>''We tried to reach out to get people's attention,'' Beckett said. ''We've started with the Yale students, the faculty and staff. With the help of the administration, we've made it an event.''</p>
        <p>Beckett has also made it a free event for members of the Yale community. Children 12 years and younger are also admitted free. General admission seats are usually $6, $12 for reserved (ticket prices are higher for the Princeton and Harvard games). The parking lots on Derby Avenue behind the Bowl that formerly charged $5 per car are now also free.</p>
        <p>''From there we've gone to youth organizations and local groups to try and sell them on the theme of family fun,'' Beckett said. ''We encourage people to go down onto the field after the game. They can say hello to the players and coaches, get autographs or just run around on the field.''</p>
        <p>After Cozza retired from coaching, Beckett asked him to lead a fund-raising effort for the Bowl's restoration.</p>
        <p>''Basically, a cosmetic face-lift,'' said Cozza, who has helped raise $2 million of the projected $3.5 budget. ''A recent study determined that structurally the Bowl is still very sound. It does need some fixing up of the concrete, and the benches can use some improvements.''</p>
        <p>Construction of the Bowl, designed by Charles A. Ferry, was started by the Sperry Engineering Company of New Haven in August 1913. By the time it was completed in November 1914, the cost was $750,000. The large scoreboard was added in 1958, while the press box was erected in 1986.</p>
        <p>''One of the best things about the Bowl is the promenade that has been restored,'' Beckett said. ''It's a half-mile around the top of the structure that anyone can walk on. I see strollers up there, couples walking.</p>
        <p>''Where else can you watch a football game on a beautiful fall day and get your exercise with such a beautiful view?''</p>
