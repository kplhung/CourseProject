        <p>We asked online readers of Samuel G. Freedman's article to discuss the issue of conflict within the Jewish community. Here are some responses from ,a New York Times online knowledge network.</p>
        <p>The reaction of Reform and, to some extent, Conservative Jews to Orthodox resurgence is natural: having bet on the possibility of remaining ethnically Jewish while dropping most religious trappings, these movements now see that they have lost the bet. Intermarriage and assimilation have passed 50 percent, and the number of children born to the Orthodox is far higher than for the non-Orthodox. The nomination of Joseph Lieberman will only reinforce self-assured-ness among the Orthodox and defeatism among the non-Orthodox.</p>

        <p>Instead of criticizing her neighbor for cutting his lawn on the Sabbath, the Orthodox Jewish woman should have invited him for Shabbos lunch.</p>

        <p>Part of the problem may be that many Reform Jews harbor guilt because they know that they are violating the Commandments. Such guilt often manifests as hostility.</p>
