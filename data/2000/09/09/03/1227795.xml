        <p>Vince Carter, showman, All-Star and now Olympian, has become basketball's biggest wishbone. The purists and the icons are tugging one leg, telling him he needs to be a more complete player. The National Basketball Association and its highlight-obsessed fans pull hard on the other, shouting: ''Dunk! dunk!''</p>
        <p>Those conflicting signals are enough to make a 23-year-old dizzy.</p>
        <p>This is the part of Vinsanity they don't show on Sportscenter.</p>
        <p>Vince Carter's mother, Michelle Carter-Robinson, arises at 4:30 a.m., here on Thursday morning. While her son sleeps, she conducts the daily business of selling ''Vince Carter,'' on the East Coast, where it is 10:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>''I just want him to concentrate on basketball,'' she said. ''The way things have been going lately, I could tell that wasn't happening.''</p>
        <p>There was a reported $30 million shoe deal with Nike, a contract that would pay off his legal debt for attempting to pull out of his contract with Puma and put Carter on new, stratospheric endorsement ground. Not true, Carter says, but he wishes it were.</p>
        <p>And there was the quick and painful end to last season, when Carter's Toronto Raptors were swept in the first round by the Knicks. His coach, Butch Carter, kept talking and talking and eventually was fired.  Tracy McGrady, his closest friend and teammate, left for Orlando to play with Grant Hill. McGrady took not-so-subtle shots at Carter after his departure.</p>
        <p>Worse, there were those comments from Michael Jordan earlier this summer, aimed at drawing a clear distinction between Carter and Kobe Bryant, the league's other most scintillating young player.</p>
        <p>Essentially, Jordan said that Kobe is more sound and a better all-around player than Vince.</p>
        <p>''It kind of makes you want to throw up your hands and say, 'Make up your mind,' '' Carter said. ''I do get mixed messages. I hear everything, but I just try to go about my life. If I sit here and worry about all that, man, I could go down the tubes in a hurry.''</p>
        <p>''The dunking is a part of the game. ,'' he added. ''Sometimes, I watch ESPN or read in the paper, 'Oh, Vince didn't get a dunk tonight.' So what? The dunk didn't make me famous. I earned the honor of being selected to the All-Star Game. I think that's major. The dunk is flash. That's what people want to see. But that didn't make me famous. I think I earned respect from players. 'Vince put up some numbers.' Of course, I won the hearts of a lot of young people because of the flash. But that flash is not going to be there my whole career. I can tell you that now.''</p>
        <p>''In some ways, I guess I asked for this. I love to put on a show. But I also know the league can't give me a championship. I have to go earn it.''</p>
        <p>Carter also understands that as long as his team loses in the playoffs and players like Bryant advance, detractors will wonder if he is more style than substance.</p>
        <p>''Kobe's a good player,'' Carter said. ''He has a ring. I don't. But the comparisons? That kind of stuff doesn't get me down or bother me. I'm still going to play. I'm still going to do what I have to do to win games.''</p>
        <p>Said Michelle Carter-Robinson:, ''Michael Jordan is entitled to his opinion just like I am entitled to mine. Now I have my opinion why Michael Jordan made so public his negative evaluation of Vince's game.</p>
        <p>''One day when I meet Michael face to face, believe me, I would like to discuss that with him. If you think Kobe Bryant is a better player, wonderful. There are others who think Vince Carter is a better player. And who is better doesn't really make any difference. Kobe is a fantastic player. Vince is a fantastic player.</p>
        <p>''Look, there have been a lot of 'nexts' out there. Stackhouse. Penny. Grant Hill. The list goes on and on. Possibly, Vince has threatened the idea of having a real 'next' more than anyone else. Possibly. I'll just leave it that.''</p>
        <p>Michael needs to keep Vince down, if for no other reason than his legacy may someday be challenged by another North Carolina skywalker who left school after his junior year.</p>
        <p>It's a bit of a maternal reach, but perhaps not that removed. Like Jordan, Carter-Robinson's son can't help but stand out.</p>
        <p>Carter grew his hair this summer. For the moment, gone is the pronounced dome that distinguished him almost as much as Mark Messier's forehead distinguished the hockey icon. A late selection to the Olympic team, Carter also has tried to quietly fit in with his teammates -- many of whom wondered if his stardom might obscure their own.</p>
        <p>For five days of training camp, he melted into the background while Kevin Garnett, Gary Payton and Tim Hardaway whooped, hollered and had a grand time scrimmaging. But the spotlight shone down Thursday night, in Team USA's first exhibition against Canada. The best aerial show in North America could no longer stay grounded.</p>
        <p>In a 99-70 victory at the University of Hawaii, Carter scored 29 points in 19 minutes. His signature field goal came with about 7 minutes left in the game. Jason Kidd flicked an alley-oop toward the right side of the rim as Carter rose and elevated behind the Canadian front line.</p>
        <p>He grabbed the ball at its apex with two hands and dunked along the baseline, bringing more than 7,000 people to their feet.</p>
        <p>Air Canada, at cruising altitude, en route to Sydney.</p>
        <p>On an Olympic team low on star power because of injuries and disinterest, he is again trying to keep his balance. Keeping NBC's Olympic basketball ratings afloat and also being a team player is a tough juggling act.</p>
        <p>''The thing I admire about Vince, he realizes that he needs to be a complete player,''  Carter-Robinson said. ''He also thinks that it's important that he entertain the crowd. When you buy a ticket to the game, it's no different than if you buy a ticket to the movies or Boyz 2 Men. This is entertainment. I don't care what else they call it.</p>
        <p>''And he feels like for your money, when he's on that court and he gets his opportunity, well, 'I have an obligation to you to entertain.''</p>
        <p>The mother, a middle school and high school teacher for 20 years before retiring in 1998, had a talk with her son before the Canada game. Beyond wearing the Mom hat, she also oversees his business interests and the work of his foundation. She knows when he is overwhelmed with life outside of basketball.</p>
        <p>''It was just a stay-focused, let-me-worry-about-the-business-end-of-it talk,'' she said. ''I probably sounded like a Baptist preacher when I told him 'With God on your side, what man should you fear?' But oh well. Mostly, I wanted to get across 'You play basketball.' And, of course, the most important thing that I told him was, 'Mommy loves you.'</p>
        <p>''Vince wants to please the N.B.A., but I think he wants to please his Mom just a little bit more,'' Carter-Robinson said. ''It's more important to me that I like my son after basketball is over.''</p>
