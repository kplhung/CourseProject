        <p>New York City health officials said yesterday that a 53-year-old Staten Island woman had become infected with the West Nile virus, the eighth victim in the city this year.</p>
        <p>Another confirmed case was reported in New Jersey on Friday, involving a 43-year-old Jersey City man. He is the first known victim of the virus in that state this year.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Brooklyn yesterday, Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the New York City health commissioner, said the Staten Island woman became ill on Aug. 23. She is recovering and is expected to be released from the hospital in a few days, he said.</p>
        <p>The woman is one of three city residents who remain hospitalized with a form of encephalitis caused by the virus. No deaths from West Nile have been reported this year. Another of the hospitalized victims, however, an 87-year-old Brooklyn woman, has been in critical condition for more than a week, health officials have said.</p>
        <p>''Since the past few weeks have been the peak time of the mosquito season, it is not surprising to learn of additional human cases,'' Dr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>He said laboratory tests by the City Health Department had identified 11 new cases of the West Nile virus in dead birds found across the city. Among them was a cockatiel -- the first domesticated bird known to have been infected inside a home. The bird died in an East Harlem apartment.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen said the discovery of the cockatiel underscored the need for people to guard against mosquitoes in their homes by keeping window screens tightly closed.</p>
        <p>''We continue to strongly urge New Yorkers, especially older adults, to take personal precautions against mosquitoes,'' he said.</p>
