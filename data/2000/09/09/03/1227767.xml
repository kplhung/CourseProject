        <p>By tradition an intense new phase of the presidential campaign starts this weekend. Since experience suggests that whoever is ahead in the polls after Labor Day usually wins the race in November, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are scrambling hard to gain traction on defining issues -- fiscal responsibility, health care and retirement security for Mr. Gore, and schools, tax cuts and defense for Mr. Bush. But a new measure of the Texas governor's troubles in the last two weeks came with his decision to launch a tough television ad with a personal attack on Mr. Gore's integrity. Suddenly a tone of alarm could be detected in a once-confident Republican campaign that had promised to remain positive.</p>
        <p>Sooner or later, Mr. Bush's campaign was bound to remind voters of what Mr. Gore himself has called an embarrassment, his visit to a Buddhist temple in California where campaign donors were in attendance. The vice president's implausible denials that he was aware that this was a fund-raising event are, of course, fair game as an issue. But Mr. Gore is right to remind Americans that he favors campaign finance reform and Mr. Bush does not. There may be no similarly awkward pictures of the governor meeting with donors, but Mr. Bush has been a prodigious fund-raiser from special interests this year and his Republican allies in Congress are the ones who blocked the soft-money ban that would do much to clean up the system.</p>

        <p>By tradition an intense new phase of the presidential campaign starts this weekend. Since experience suggests that whoever is ahead in the polls after Labor Day usually wins the race in November, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are scrambling hard to gain traction on defining issues -- fiscal responsibility, health care and retirement security for Mr. Gore, and schools, tax cuts and defense for Mr. Bush. But a new measure of the Texas governor's troubles in the last two weeks came with his decision to launch a tough television ad with a personal attack on Mr. Gore's integrity. Suddenly a tone of alarm could be detected in a once-confident Republican campaign that had promised to remain positive.</p>
        <p>Sooner or later, Mr. Bush's campaign was bound to remind voters of what Mr. Gore himself has called an embarrassment, his visit to a Buddhist temple in California where campaign donors were in attendance. The vice president's implausible denials that he was aware that this was a fund-raising event are, of course, fair game as an issue. But Mr. Gore is right to remind Americans that he favors campaign finance reform and Mr. Bush does not. There may be no similarly awkward pictures of the governor meeting with donors, but Mr. Bush has been a prodigious fund-raiser from special interests this year and his Republican allies in Congress are the ones who blocked the soft-money ban that would do much to clean up the system.</p>
        <p>The new ad reflects an underlying reality of the campaign: that on most issues of concern to voters, the polls show Mr. Gore at an advantage, whereas until the conventions most voters seemed to like Mr. Bush better as a leader. For months Mr. Gore found it hard to make headway in the polls, despite broad popular support for using the surplus to pay for school aid, limited tax cuts and a prescription drug program in Medicare. In the last two weeks Mr. Bush has not had much success in rallying support for his more sweeping tax cut. Despite his 100th appearance in a school in this campaign, he is not especially favored on education either.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's campaign may have felt it had little choice but to return to the two issues that have worked before -- defense, where Republicans hold a distinct advantage according to most polls, and the issue of trustworthiness as a leader. Indeed, tacticians in both camps have long assumed that Mr. Bush would have to link Mr. Gore to the ethical lapses of the Clinton administration at some point in the campaign.</p>
        <p>The problem is that the Republican ad depicting Mr. Gore as a politician who would say anything to win appeared only a day after Mr. Bush promised not to engage in personal attacks. It undercut the one advantage the governor has enjoyed thus far: voters' perception of him as a likable, confident and straight-talking leader. Since polls show that voters overwhelmingly hate so-called negative ads, it is now possible that voters will focus on the Bush tactic, and think less of him for it, than on the point the ad is making. A similar problem arose with Mr. Gore a couple of months ago when he started attacking Mr. Bush on issues and then had to defend himself against criticism that he was going negative.</p>
        <p>In political terms, it is hard to tell how voters will react to Mr. Bush's decision to have his running mate, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, attack Mr. Gore for alleged declines in military readiness. Though many voters trust Republicans on this issue, the polls also show that they do not seem to be terribly concerned about it this year. Their attention may also be called to the uncertain tone of the criticism. While Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney want greater readiness, they also say they want less involvement by American troops in peacekeeping in Europe and elsewhere. Such a position runs counter to Mr. Bush's pledge for the United States not to shrink from its global responsibilities. William Kristol, the acerbic editor of The Weekly Standard, last week called such talk from Republicans of reduced involvement more reminiscent of George McGovern than Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>A final note of defensiveness by the Bush campaign was sounded on the issue of debates. Mr. Bush says he wants to participate, but his negotiators are pressing for debates to be broadcast on one network only. That demand would not serve the public. With issues mattering more and more, the best way for them to be addressed would be in debates on prime time with all networks showing them. The Gore and Bush campaigns should get down to the business of agreeing on times and dates without delay.</p>
