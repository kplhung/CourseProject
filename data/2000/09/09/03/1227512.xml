        <p>I WATCHED as the door snapped shut behind my wife. She was gone, on her way to an extra-long shift at work, leaving me in charge of our 3-year-old daughter for the next 14 hours.

        <p>I WATCHED as the door snapped shut behind my wife. She was gone, on her way to an extra-long shift at work, leaving me in charge of our 3-year-old daughter for the next 14 hours. Not that I was sweating it. After all, when it comes to fatherhood, I am as modern as a nanny-cam. Just call me Mr. Dedication, Mr.-Put-in-the-Time, Mr. . . .</p>
        <p>''Daddy?'' My daughter was tugging on my shirt.</p>
        <p>''Yes, Sweet Pea?''</p>
        <p>''I want Mommy.''</p>
        <p>I distracted her masterfully with an offer to play with Big Baby, her beloved, bonneted doll. As long as Big Baby was around, we could do 14 hours with ease. The moment I picked up Big Baby, though, I saw something as unwelcome as a skunk at a garden party. Big Baby's once lifelike-looking left eye was twisted hopelessly up into her head.  Coming exactly 13 hours and 58 minutes before my wife was due back, this wasn't just problematic. It was a Grade A disaster.</p>
        <p>''Let's get pizza,'' I blurted out. My daughter considered me with instant suspicion and said, ''I want Big Baby.'' Forlorn, I handed the doll over.</p>
        <p>''Her eye is brok-ed!'' she shrieked and the countdown was on to total thermonuclear temper tantrum, but I bought a few seconds by promising to fix broken eye. First, I tried to rejigger it, but that turned it farther up into her head. So, with no time to lose and my adrenals racing, I hurriedly reached for the Westchester Yellow Pages.</p>
        <p>There was a listing for the New York Doll Hospital in Manhattan, but between tolls and parking, going into the city would cost lots and that's before paying for the uninsured Big Baby's procedure.</p>
        <p>There were seven other listings under dolls. What became clear, though, after a few phone calls was that these establishments didn't fix dolls. They sold them. Good baby doll health care seemed as hard to come by as the human kind.</p>
        <p>Finally, a woman at Russell's Doll House &amp; Miniature Bazaar told me that there was a place called the Doll Room that she'd sent people with broken dolls to ''and I assume they're good,'' she said, ''because none of them have come back.'' I didn't know whether that sounded promising or ominous, but I had few options, so I dialed.</p>
        <p>''Is it a vinyl head?'' asked Dee Domroe, co-owner of the Doll Room. It was, and that made Mrs. Domroe sigh. She specializes, she explained, in reviving antique dolls. The new ones, she said, with a sniff of displeasure, ''are made to play with and throw out.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Domroe instinctively knew where I stood. ''If your child has an emotional attachment to the doll, they are actually quite easy to fix. It'll only take a moment, and we won't even charge,'' she said, kindly.  The rub was that the procedure had its risks: ''We'll have to pop the head off.'' If ever a situation called for heroic measures, though, this was it, so lickety-split, we raced the 50 miles from lower Westchester to Bridgewater, Conn.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Domroe and her husband, Walter, welcomed us to their doll operating room, which was attached to their centuries-old farmhouse. Mr. Domroe put on a miner's cap and set to work looking at Big Baby, who looked truly vulnerable, stretched out beneath such a harsh light.</p>
        <p>On cue, Mrs. Domroe pointed us toward her enormous collection of 19th-  and early-20th-century dolls, including a Kaiser Baby (a once big-selling German doll named and modeled after Kaiser Wilhelm). Luckily, my daughter took a liking to the pocket-size Kaiser and was distracted because just a few feet away, Mr. Domroe was unceremoniously decapitating Big Baby.</p>
        <p>My mind raced. Would Big Baby be O.K. and, just as important, if she weren't, how could I survive the 11 hours and 37 minutes until my wife came home? Relief arrived shortly with a smiling Mr. Domroe.</p>
        <p>Big Baby's eye was completely cured. I peered closer -- she also didn't show a single ill effect from the decapitation. I didn't know who looked happier -- my daughter, or the Domroes when they saw how happy they had made my daughter.</p>
        <p>My daughter took Big Baby's little vinyl hand and waved bye-bye to the Domroes, and then we were in the car. I leaned back in my seat, relaxed. And I allowed myself a moment to revel in my status as Up-to-Date Dad.</p>
        <p>''Daddy?'' piped up a little voice in the back.</p>
        <p>''Yes, Sweet Pea?''</p>
        <p>''How many more minutes till Mommy comes home?''</p>
