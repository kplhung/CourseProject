        <p>AMONG Shakespeare's tragic heroes, Coriolanus stands apart. The others seduce us. This one -- Rome's greatest warrior turned Rome's fiercest scourge -- scorns even to try.

        <p>AMONG Shakespeare's tragic heroes, Coriolanus stands apart. The others seduce us. This one -- Rome's greatest warrior turned Rome's fiercest scourge -- scorns even to try. When his city casts him out, he joins forces with the enemy, sparing his compatriots not out of clemency but out of deference to his gorgon mother.</p>
        <p>The play to which he lends his name, though praised by a handful, is loved by few. Nor does his character find many defenders. Yet as a comrade in arms, the man shines like a beacon: to the courageous, a guardian angel; to the craven, a holy terror.</p>
        <p>Who forgives Coriolanus his righteousness, or his vicious temper? In the field, against the enemy Volscians, he takes no end of punishment, expecting no special credit (most certainly not panegyrics) for his matchless deeds, and that is a sort of hubris. But what does his tragic flaw amount to beside the self-lacerating intellect of Brutus, who slaughters his beloved Caesar? Beside the ambition of Macbeth, who dispatches a sainted monarch? Beside the jealousy of Othello, who murders a blameless wife? Hamlet's indecision, Mark Antony's self-indulgence and King Lear's vanity cause no end of calamity, to themselves and others. Still, we suspend judgment, captivated by their gift for metaphor or philosophical speculation. Coriolanus goes his way alone; his soul has little music, maybe none.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the Almeida Theater Company's production of ''Coriolanus,'' directed by Jonathan Kent, which begins performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Saturday, will challenge entrenched opinion. The title role is entrusted to Ralph Fiennes, the protagonist also of the Almeida's ''Richard II,'' which will alternate with ''Coriolanus.'' Not that Mr. Fiennes is an actor to trade on easy charm. Yet deep within his tense, careworn stage persona runs a streak of pathos that exercises a powerful seduction of its own. In London, at the point in Act V where Shakespeare's stage direction has Coriolanus holding his mother ''by the hand, silent,'' Mr. Fiennes grabbed her hand, kneeling and sobbing.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare's departures in ''Coriolanus'' from his standard practice are radical -- so much so that studies of the play tend reflexively to switch focus from figure to ground. The clashes between patrician and plebeian at the center of the tragedy are indeed in an epic class by themselves: an anatomy of the body politic at its most disordered, conducted with an icily impartial hand. At a historic production in Paris in the 1930's,  riots broke out between Fascists and Communists. Each side was convinced that Shakespeare was affirming the justice of their own party line and exposing the bad faith of their opponents. (Or was it the other way around?)</p>
        <p>Against the excitement of the crowd scenes and in the absence of poetically arresting language, what becomes of those specifically tragic stirrings of compassion for the hero, which Aristotle ascribed to pity and terror (and Shakespeare to woe and wonder)? The view of Frank Kermode in the Riverside Shakespeare epitomizes received wisdom: ''We never feel that the author allows the hero to come very close to him or to us, but in spite of his keeping Coriolanus at a critical arm's length, Shakespeare can rarely have more fully extended his powers than he does here.''</p>
        <p>At critical arm's length? Seen another way, not even in the scarcely endurable ordeals of the outcast Lear does Shakespeare probe a heart more feelingly. In fact, in certain respects, his achievement in ''Coriolanus'' is more extraordinary than in ''Lear.'' Lear's existential trajectory teaches him (and us) what it means to be a human being against the backdrop of indifferent, unfeeling Nature. It is a lesson the outcast sovereign learns at a few seconds to midnight, at a threshold of mortality (''fourscore and upward''), from which the playwright, the actor and presumably the vast majority of viewers feel safely detached. Any identification with him (if identification is quite the word) remains contemplative, theoretical.</p>
        <p>In Coriolanus, by contrast, we encounter a man of action in the prime of life, a condition that most of us (wishfully or accurately) equate with our own. Yet even at the pinnacle of autonomy, he hovers at the edge of the abyss: a man yet still a boy, a law unto himself yet, to his credit. of ''woman's tenderness'' in the face of the wife and son he has tried in vain to banish from his heart. Humbling, even humiliating knowledge, frightening to witness. Mr. Kermode calls Coriolanus a ''beast-god,'' meaning a monster. Our brother, rather. In the entire tragic canon, Shakespeare tells no sadder story, or one that cuts closer.</p>
        <p>For all the reviled hero's faults, much counts in his favor. Presumption and malicious detraction rile him, but he acknowledges good will, loses bets like a gentleman and praises his Volscian nemesis without reserve. He invades an enemy city single-handed, but leaves the room rather than hear his deeds praised. He knows no greed or envy. Only under extreme provocation does he speak up in his own defense. His affections run deep, as evidenced when he dries his wife's tears coming home from the wars. As for his refusal to coax or charm by diplomacy or fine language, this, too, redounds to his credit. Like Cordelia, Lear's true-hearted youngest daughter, rejected for plain speaking, he lacks ''That glib and oily art/ To speak and purpose not,'' and finds an eloquence in silence -- his most revealing moments are seldom his loudest. His rare sallies into metaphor -- in exile he gives his address as ''th' city of kites and crows'' -- are terse and often harrowingly to the point.</p>
        <p>The embodiment of the forces that destroy Coriolanus from within is Volumnia, his mother, unlike any other in Shakespeare. Romeo and Juliet have mothers, for all the good it does them. Richard III has one, for all the good it does her. Lady Macbeth seems to be one, though no offspring are in evidence, and of the specters that haunt her husband, childlessness torments him most. Of Shakespeare's handful of mothers with grown sons to manage (notably Gertrude, in ''Hamlet,'' and the Countess of Rossillion, in ''All's Well That Ends Well''), Volumnia alone shows the muscle for the job.</p>
        <p>To all Rome, her son is Coriolanus, a name fresh-earned in blood by the walls of the enemy town of Corioles. To Volumnia, who flutters out to meet him as the troops return, all the while thanking the gods for the wounds and scars he bears, he is ''my boy Martius.'' Tullus Aufidius, general of the Volscians, on whose mercy Coriolanus casts himself when the Roman rabble drives him out, calls him ''boy,'' too, with lethal consequences. ''When blows have made me stay, I fled from words,'' the hero confesses early on. And words, not swords, are the weapons that destroy him.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Volumnia, and in part for her son, her powers do not work at a distance. The first of their two pitched battles of will occurs in the wake of his reluctant campaign for the office of consul, a political honor incompatible with his temperament or his talents. Custom demands that a candidate stand forth publicly in a ''gown of humility,'' showing passers-by his war wounds and soliciting their votes, or ''voices.'' Coriolanus submits and wins election, but his half-heartedness and sarcasm as he goes through the distasteful motions give the Machiavellian tribunes of the people all the ammunition they need to nullify the vote. ''Have I had children's voices?'' the outraged consul-elect demands, characteristically counting on men to live up to their word. Before long, the mob is baying for his blood. The only hope for Coriolanus at this pass would be to make a calculated show of contrition, a self-inflicted disgrace he consents to only after Volumnia has played the most powerful card in her manipulative deck: the threat of walking out.</p>
        <p>FROM the strategic point of view, she has only been making sense. To her son, the appeal to expediency spells utter betrayal, a trampling of the very values by which she has taught him to live his life. He predicts that he will botch the charade (Shakespeare's allusions to actors are seldom complimentary), and, sure enough, he does. Once back in the public world of men, it takes the tribunes the single word of ''traitor'' to goad Coriolanus to frenzy, with his banishment the speedy result.</p>
        <p>When mother and son meet for the last time, he is leading the Volscian army against Rome. Does this make him a traitor? Readers have said so, but not the appalled patricians in the play, who see his revenge as deserved retribution. Neither do the spineless plebeians, who wring their ineffectual hands, or even the unprincipled tribunes, whose wan hope is that the dreadful news will prove false.</p>
        <p>Yet here Volumnia grasps the real monstrosity of his position. Once again, though in a nobler cause, she goes the distance. Once again, her boy capitulates at last, consenting to a peace that must cost him his life. The flexible Aufidius, in whose rotten code of honor Coriolanus has naively placed his faith, sells him out for personal gain. As a last indignity, the butchered warrior is subjected to his killer's cold epitaph:</p>
        <p>Though in this city he</p>
        <p>Hath widowed and unchilded many a one,</p>
        <p>Which to this hour bewail the injury,</p>
        <p>Yet he shall have a noble memory.</p>
        <p>What is it Mark Antony says over the corpse of Caesar? ''The evil that men do lives after them,/ The good is oft interred with their bones.'' So let it not be with Martius.</p>
