        <p>(Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>LEFT BACK: A Century of Failed School Reforms, by Diane Ravitch. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $30.) An education expert who has often run with conservatives argues that 20th-century ''progressive'' theorists watered down education for non-elites in the name of ''life adjustment'' and other slogans, depriving those very groups of the knowledge to help them rise.</p>
        <p>THE GENTLEMAN FROM NEW YORK. Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Biography, by Godfrey Hodgson. (Houghton Mifflin, $38.) A life of the right's favorite liberal, or the left's favorite neocon, always intelligent, usually correct and at peace with his impending retirement; by a British journalist and friend.</p>
        <p>KHOMEINI: Life of the Ayatollah, by Baqer Moin. (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $27.95.) An Iranian (and former Muslim seminarian) gives a deft account of the background and rise to power of the gifted, shrewd cleric and politician who destroyed Iran's monarchy and forever changed the course of its history.</p>
        <p>AN OBEDIENT FATHER, by Akhil Sharma. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) The main narrator in this novel by a New York investment banker is a low, corrupt functionary in the Delhi school system. It's easy to brand him despicable because he is, but his power to do ill is limited, his personality complex and his author compassionate.</p>
        <p>BLOOD OF THE LIBERALS, by George Packer. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $26.) Liberalism, under one or another definition, is the force that shaped and eventually failed the author's grandfather (a Congressman from Alabama), his father (a legal scholar and student of procedure) and himself (once a Peace Corps volunteer, now a writer, and though bloodied not yet totally bowed).</p>
        <p>A HOLE IN THE EARTH, by Robert Bausch. (Harcourt, $24.) Bausch's fourth novel concerns Henry Porter, 39, the sole flop in a family of successes, whose fixation in preternatural adolescence is mitigated by his own humiliations and the kindness of others.</p>
        <p>THE SECRET PARTS OF FORTUNE: Three Decades of Intense Investigations and Edgy Enthusiasms, by Ron Rosenbaum. (Random House, $29.95.) A generous collection of journalism by a writer who has exposed himself to many of the great obsessions of the 20th century without losing his curiosity, his skepticism or his willingness to listen.</p>
        <p>I LOVED YOU ALL, by Paula Sharp. (Hyperion, $23.95.) An old-fashioned storytelling novel about the escalating defiance of hard-line anti-abortionists in the 1970's; the leading character (on the side that is clearly not the author's) has the depth and energy to become indispensable to people whose lives or children are out of control.</p>
        <p>SISTER: The Life of the Legendary American Interior Decorator Mrs. Henry Parish II, by Apple Parish Bartlett and Susan Bartlett Crater. (St. Martin's, $35.) An oral history, compiled by the daughter and granddaughter of the formidably descended aristocrat who went into the decorating business in 1933 and lived a life characterized by robust frivolity and hard work.</p>
