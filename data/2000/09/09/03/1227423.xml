        <p>ALWAYS BEGINNING</p>
        <p>Essays on a Life in Poetry.</p>
        <p>By Maxine Kumin.</p>
        <p>Copper Canyon, paper, $17.</p>
        <p>In ''Motherhood and Poetics,'' an essay about her poetic awakening, Maxine Kumin invokes Rilke's advice to ''await the birth-hour of a new clarity.'' ''Always Beginning'' could function as her personal scrapbook, redolent of gestations both actual and literary. This prose collection traces parallel developments in Kumin's career. First, and most effective, are her memoirs of cultivating her New Hampshire farm, with diary entries devoted to vegetable beds and rearing foals. Alongside these versions of the pastoral, she charts her growth as a writer. When Kumin began publishing in the late 1950's, she writes, male editors viewed her as ''some rare species of flightless bird to be sighted on special occasions.'' She found friendship and solidarity with the poet Anne Sexton; they collaborated on four children's books and exchanged poems regularly by phone until Sexton committed suicide in 1974. ''I was hanging on to her, like the nuns who hung on to St. Theresa's boot tops to pull her back down when she levitated,'' Kumin writes. ''I was trying very hard to keep her feet on the ground.'' Decidedly less satisfying are Kumin's appreciations of other poets and analyses of her own work. Here her commentary is bland and obvious, except when she links poems to personal experience (as when she describes how Housman's ''Shropshire Lad'' soothed her during an M.R.I. session). A haphazard quality pervades many of the pieces, which, taken together, lack a unifying theme. Nevertheless, ''Always Beginning'' is a handy companion to Kumin's poetry.</p>
