        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband sat atop a counter at Gianelli's Sausage stand at the New York State Fair here today and, with dozens of cameras clicking and whirling, consumed two huge, gloppy sausage sandwiches, loaded with onions, peppers and barbecue sauce.</p>
        <p>''It's great,'' Mrs. Clinton pronounced, her voice muffled by the sandwich she was eating, as she swayed to country music blaring over tinny loudspeakers. President Clinton took a moment from his very obvious enjoyment of his sandwich to wipe his wife's mouth with a napkin.</p>
        <p>This, though, was more than just another photo opportunity being staged by a twice-elected president and a first-time Senate candidate who have come to appreciate the photographic advantages offered by a state fair.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's meal today came a week after her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, demurred at the same state fair when a reporter from a Syracuse newspaper asked whether he enjoyed sausage sandwiches, one of the favorite foodstuffs at the annual fair. Mr. Lazio, acknowledging that the sandwiches were not among his favorites, did not eat one.</p>
        <p>At a fund-raiser this afternoon, Mr. Clinton made an explicit, if slightly exaggerated, reference to Mr. Lazio's sausage encounter. ''After the other candidate for Senate refused to eat a sausage sandwich there, this one did not,'' Mr. Clinton said to roars of laughter from a partisan crowd.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Lazio, Brian Flood, responded this evening, ''Growing up in New York, with a name like Lazio, I'm sure our candidate is a bit more acquainted with sausages, not to mention peppers and onions, than Mrs. Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Today's visit was the Clintons' second to the state fair, and, as they did last summer, they found huge and enthusiastic crowds. Visitors stood six-deep on a humid, overcast afternoon, waiting for hours, presumably to see a president, since Mrs. Clinton (and, for that matter, Mr. Lazio) never draws crowds anywhere near this large. Both the president and Mrs. Clinton enjoyed the friendly reception, going to opposite sides of the road and shaking every hand in sight.</p>
        <p>''You look great in peach!'' one woman cried, remarking on the color of Mrs. Clinton's pantsuit.</p>
        <p>''Thanks,'' she responded.</p>
        <p>Patrick Hogan, a burly security guard in front of the sausage stand, sidled up to the Clintons for a picture, and then whispered to Mrs. Clinton, ''You've got my vote.''</p>
        <p>The visit to the state fair consumed most of what was supposed to be a day of relaxation. From here, Mrs. Clinton was heading for a second fund-raiser. When a reporter asked her if this was a ''real vacation,'' she paused for a long moment, widened her eyes and said, ''Sort of.''</p>
        <p>The Clintons spent the night in Skaneateles, where homeowners  along the Clinton motorcade route scattered their front lawns with signs bearing the names of both Senate candidates. An unscientific survey suggested an edge for Mr. Lazio; this is a Republican part of the state.</p>
        <p>At the sausage stand, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton clowned around a bit. The president tied a bandanna around his own neck and then proceeded to tie one around his wife's as well. ''Don't pull it too tight,'' she instructed her husband.</p>
