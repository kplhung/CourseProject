        <p>DONNA WILLIAMS and Michael Lynch love their new house, the first they've ever owned. But if not for an  elevator accident, and a real estate broker willing to sacrifice part of his commission to make a sale, the house might never have been theirs.</p>
        <p>Until recently, Ms. Williams and Mr. Lynch were living in a tiny ground-floor apartment in Long Island City, where they couldn't even open the windows. ''Every window faced a garbage can,'' Ms. Williams said, and the garbage always smelled. And at $720 a month, the apartment wasn't even all that cheap.</p>
        <p>Finally, some extra money -- very hard-earned -- came their way. Seven years ago, when Ms. Williams was working as an executive secretary for a Midtown company, she was taking an elevator so she could go outside for a cigarette. The elevator malfunctioned. ''I got caught in the doors and they crushed me,'' she said. ''It broke the bones in my hand and my shoulder.''</p>
        <p>The accident left her with very little strength in her left arm; she can't lift more  than four pounds, she said, less than the weight of many purses. She was out of work for nine months getting therapy, and lost her job. For several years, she said, she couldn't work at all.</p>
        <p>For the last three years, she has been a customer-service representative for an offset printing company in Manhattan. And last October, the lawsuit she had filed was finally settled, and she was awarded enough money to allow her to pay off bills and set aside some cash for a down payment.</p>
        <p>The trouble was, when she called brokers, they all said that she and Mr. Lynch, a plumber, didn't have enough money to buy a two-family house in Queens, where the brokers said the prices ranged from $375,000 to $400,000. But they didn't give up. At an open house in Jackson Heights, they met a broker, Charles Sciberras of ReMax Today on Steinway Street in Astoria. ''He says, 'I  really like you, and I'm going to get you a house.' '' Ms. Williams recalled.</p>
        <p>Not long after, he took them to a two-family brick house on 47th Street near 30th Avenue in Astoria. ''You couldn't see the windows for the weeds and car parts,'' Ms. Williams said. Inside it was worse. The second floor had been nearly destroyed by a tenant who then sublet the space to 15 people. The basement was filled with junk. And the asking price of $360,000 meant they couldn't quite qualify for the mortgage they would need.</p>
        <p>BUT despite the problems, Ms. Williams and Mr. Lynch were interested. And Mr. Sciberras made the sale possible by reducing the amount of his standard commission -- 6 percent of the $360,000, or $21,600, paid by the seller -- by $5,000. In this way, the seller could receive the money she wanted, and Ms. Williams and Mr. Lynch could qualify for the mortgage.</p>
        <p>''I never let a brokerage fee get in the way of a sale,'' Mr. Sciberras said. ''I like to make a good living, but I'm in this for the long run. When they go to sell it, who are they going to think of? Me.''</p>
        <p>After closing in July, Ms. Williams and Mr. Lynch began spending their nights and weekends working on the upstairs apartment, which they plan to rent out. They scrubbed mildew that was left from a leak, replaced wallboard where they needed to, fixed the plumbing, sanded the floors and painted the apartment, which is now a pleasing, light-filled space.</p>
        <p>The only problem has been the tree in their front yard, which Ms. Williams disliked on aesthetic grounds even before it crashed into her front window during a storm, damaging her computer.</p>
        <p>If she had the money, she said, she would have it ripped out, and she would replace it with some concrete statues and pots with plants in them.</p>
        <p>''I don't want a tree,'' she said. ''It belongs in Central Park.''</p>
        <p>Soon, they will start working on the downstairs apartment, which has a small den, a bedroom and a living room with nice wood floors, and a kitchen with room for a small table.</p>
        <p>Once they rent out the upstairs, their monthly costs will be about what they paid for their old place. But here, Ms. Williams said, the garbage cans will be in the basement, and the front window of the small den, her favorite room, will be wide open.</p>
