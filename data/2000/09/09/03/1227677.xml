        <p>In the time it takes to introduce yourself to a potential employer and say, ''I'm a good candidate for the position,'' you may be taking yourself out of the running.</p>
        <p>Why? Not because of your appearance or qualifications, but because of the way you talk. Two researchers at the University of North Texas in Denton concluded in a study that employers based hiring decisions on their judgments of regional accents.</p>
        <p>''People are usually judged for their intelligence and other qualities based on how they sound,'' said Dianne Markley, co-author of the study and the university's director of cooperative education.</p>
        <p>Ms. Markley and the other co-author, Patricia Cukor-Avila, assistant professor of English, created a CD-ROM on which 10 white men read the same bland 45-second passage. Each speaker came from a different region of the country, had an accent common to his region and had a bachelor's degree or above.</p>
        <p>Then the researchers took the CD-ROM to 56 employers across the country. After listening to each voice, the employers  were asked to judge the speaker on 14 criteria, from education to personality type, and to identify where the speaker was from.</p>
        <p>Next, the employers were asked to rate the speakers on four categories of jobs for which they might qualify: jobs with much outside contact, those requiring high-technology skills, those requiring in-house communication and those needing little technical skill and low outside or in-house contact.</p>
        <p>Ms. Markley said the study found that employers who judged speakers positively, as ''intelligent'' and ''charming,'' for example, would be more likely to choose them for jobs that required public contact and technical skills. If employers judged a speaker negatively, she added, the speaker would more likely be placed in jobs with no public contact and no technical-skill requirements.</p>
        <p>The judgments correlated with how identifiable the regional accents were, Ms. Markley said. When a speaker was consistently rated low, for example, there was a strong likelihood that the employers had identified his region correctly.</p>
        <p>''This would lead you to conclude,'' Dr. Cukor-Avila said, that ''the more regional-sounding a person is, the less likely he is to be picked for high-profile jobs.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Jacobi, a speech coach in Manhattan and author of ''How to Say It With Your Voice'' (Prentice Hall), says accent bias is a common complaint of his clients.</p>
        <p>''There's still quite strong regional bias in this country,'' he said, despite efforts to promote diversity.</p>
