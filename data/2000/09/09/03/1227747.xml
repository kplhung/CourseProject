        <p>On Aug. 20, 1986, an Oklahoma postal worker shot and killed 14 co-workers, then himself. In the years since, there have been other incidents of violence and murder, sometimes multiple murder, by current or former postal workers.</p>
        <p>On Apr. 17, 1994, in his ''On Language'' column in The New York Times Magazine, William Safire discussed whether ''going postal'' meant ''losing it'' or ''not being online.'' It was the first time ''going postal'' appeared in The Times.</p>
        <p>The rest is linguistic history. Three-year-olds know what going postal means.</p>
        <p>Is the Postal Service happy about this? Not at all. So, calmly, it commissioned a lengthy study on workplace safety, a study that -- with charts and myriad statistics -- strikes out at the notion that your friendly letter carrier is likely, at any moment, to whip an Uzi out of his mail pouch.</p>
        <p>'' 'Going postal' is a myth, a bad rap,'' the report says. ''Postal workers are no more likely to physically assault, sexually harass, or verbally abuse their coworkers than employees in the national workforce.'' Retail workers, it says, are eight times as likely as postal workers to be victims of homicide at work.</p>
        <p>The study is a serious one. ''The level of violence throughout the American workplace is unacceptably high,'' it says, and offers a variety of remedies. But it also seems intent on clearing the Postal Service's tainted name, noting that part of the problem is that it has so many workers -- as a civilian employer, it's second only to Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>But it will be rough. A new expression, once it has burst from the starting gate, is awfully hard to call back. And ''going Wal-Mart'' just doesn't work.</p>
