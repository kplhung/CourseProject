        <p>Bronx River Sentry</p>
        <p>Q.: When I lived in the Bronx in the 1950's, a mysterious, unmarked statue of a Civil War soldier stood on a pedestal in the middle of the Bronx River, just south of Gun Hill Road. How did it come to be there, and for that matter, where is it now?</p>
        <p>A.: The statue was commissioned by a Morrisania veterans' group in the 1890's, to serve as a memorial marker in Woodlawn Cemetery, according to Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian.

        <p>Bronx River Sentry</p>
        <p>Q.: When I lived in the Bronx in the 1950's, a mysterious, unmarked statue of a Civil War soldier stood on a pedestal in the middle of the Bronx River, just south of Gun Hill Road. How did it come to be there, and for that matter, where is it now?</p>
        <p>A.: The statue was commissioned by a Morrisania veterans' group in the 1890's, to serve as a memorial marker in Woodlawn Cemetery, according to Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx borough historian. The pensive, gray-granite figure, attributed to a local sculptor named John Grignola, was chipped before it could be delivered, however, and the work was rejected.</p>
        <p>The statue was later bought by John B. Lazzari, operator of a nearby tombstone quarry and stonecutter's yard, who displayed it on his lawn. Mr. Lazzari's property, on the west bank of the river, included a wooden footbridge held in place by a granite pier. A tapestry factory was later established on the east bank, and in the late 1890's, when tardy workers began using his footbridge as a shortcut to the factory, Mr. Lazzari had the bridge destroyed. The Civil War soldier was placed atop the granite pier, which still stood on a tiny island in the middle of the river.</p>
        <p>Over the succeeding seven decades, the origins of the unmarked statue became the subject of much local speculation, and it remained unidentified or unmentioned in city guidebooks. The soldier began to lean forward as the L-shaped bolts holding it in place gave way, and it finally toppled into the river in 1964. It was rescued by the Parks Department and stored in a warehouse on Amsterdam Avenue until 1970, when the Bronx County Historical Society had it placed outside its office in the Valentine-Varian House, on Bainbridge Avenue and East 208th Street. It is there today.</p>
        <p>Stop That Ferry</p>
        <p>Q.: For years I have watched the unvarying routine of the Staten Island Ferry from the Brooklyn Heights promenade. On Aug. 4 at 8:30 p.m., the ferry had just pulled out when it suddenly cut its engines and returned to the slip. Only after a small, tug-shaped boat had sailed straight across the ferry's route did it set off again for Staten Island. Who can stop the ferry dead in its tracks?</p>
        <p>A.: The Staten Island Ferry enjoys no special harbor privileges and routinely yields the right of way to other vessels, according to Pamela Cess, the ferry's director of operations.</p>
        <p>In this case, however, a minor incident occurred as the ferry Andrew J. Barberi was leaving the terminal on the evening of Aug. 4. ''Police from the 120th Precinct in St. George ride the ferries back and forth,'' Ms. Cess said. ''When they get to Whitehall they normally get off the boat, wait in the terminal, and take the next one back. In this case, just as the boat was leaving, someone notified the captain that there was an emotionally disturbed passenger on board, so he pulled the boat back in, called down and got the police to come back on board.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cess said that the perspective on the terminal from Brooklyn Heights can be deceptive, and the ferry had not really even left the slip when it was pulled back. ''The boat,'' she said, ''wasn't even late when it arrived back at St. George.''</p>
        <p>Wrong War for Store</p>
        <p>Q.: Did the name of the old E. J. Korvette department stores actually stand for ''eight Jewish Korean War Veterans''?</p>
        <p>A.: Please. The name was derived from the first initials of Eugene Ferkauf, who founded the stores in 1948, his partner, Joseph Zwillenberg, and a Canadian submarine chaser called the Corvette, which was used in  World War II. The business, which began as a luggage shop on East 46th Street, eventually grew to 55 stores; the last one closed in 1981.</p>
