        <p>THERE are two bloodlines in modern puppetry: the ''low'' subversive tradition of Punch and Judy, which is sometimes called ''marketplace puppetry''; and the ''high'' tradition of Asian religious ritual and court ceremony, including Indonesian shadow puppets and Japanese Bunraku. Punch and Judy tend to bang into each other; the movement is bawdy and slapstick, and the action and speech are often explicit and violent in a way that would not be tolerable or feasible in human theater. High puppetry (which is not necessarily better than low puppetry) is gestural and exploits the same kind of control that is meaningful in ballet: it is a language for the superhuman, for gods and heroes, for stories told time out of mind to audiences that frequently know the narrative by heart.</p>

        <p>THERE are two bloodlines in modern puppetry: the ''low'' subversive tradition of Punch and Judy, which is sometimes called ''marketplace puppetry''; and the ''high'' tradition of Asian religious ritual and court ceremony, including Indonesian shadow puppets and Japanese Bunraku. Punch and Judy tend to bang into each other; the movement is bawdy and slapstick, and the action and speech are often explicit and violent in a way that would not be tolerable or feasible in human theater. High puppetry (which is not necessarily better than low puppetry) is gestural and exploits the same kind of control that is meaningful in ballet: it is a language for the superhuman, for gods and heroes, for stories told time out of mind to audiences that frequently know the narrative by heart.</p>
        <p>The task facing organizers of the first International Festival of Puppet Theater, in 1992, was to win adult audiences to the art form. That was accomplished to some extent by presenting the political and marketplace puppetry that used to dominate the American scene. (Examples range from the Bread and Puppet Theater of Vermont to the Halloween parade in Greenwich Village.) The work proved its seriousness with its urgent themes.</p>
        <p>But now that the festival has become an established part of the New York theater world, its organizers are less constrained; they have the leeway to examine other boundaries of puppetry. And that is what they are doing in this year's festival, which starts on Wednesday and runs though Sept. 24. Many performances (among more than 200 by 26 companies on 14 stages) are clearly indebted to the high tradition, and many of them could be featured in an International Festival of Dance.</p>
        <p>One day recently, Cheryl Henson, the festival's executive producer, spoke about the evolution of puppetry over the last few years and of the illusion that lies at the heart of the art. As she described the performances, her long and beautiful fingers became a pair of amazing legs; then an indrawn hand became a face; then her palms spread wide to comment on the movement of a bird. The motions were dancerly. When this was pointed out to her, she replied that she was unaware of it but said: ''You see, we have both the object as body and the body as object. The popular image of the puppeteer is that he manipulates his characters, as though they existed in time and were being pushed into his purposes. But that's a literary construct. You are bringing the object to life and it becomes a puppet when it is animated. The magic of transcendence is in the details.''</p>
        <p>The French Compagnie Philippe Genty, which played to standing-room audiences in 1992, is returning with a piece, ''Stowaways,'' in which people, puppets and complex poetic props and sets are all conflated in a confabulation of gesture: you forget, watching this material, that humans and objects are different from each other.</p>
        <p>In ''Salome,'' the New York performance artist Hanne Tierny uses disembodied pieces of fabric, metal and live improvised music to mesmeric effect in her presentation of Oscar Wilde's play.</p>
        <p>In ''Echo Trace,'' Heather Henson, Cheryl's younger sister who works out of Orlando, Fla., uses light and motion to create a whirling reality as fluid as the refracted planes seen through a kaleidoscope. She reduces human and nonhuman forms to pattern. The festival also includes variants on more traditional high puppet work, including an all-female Bunraku troupe from Japan. (A complete schedule can be found at www.hensonfestival.org.)</p>
        <p>Dance is an art of controlled movement, and so is puppetry. The two fields have become increasingly intimate. Yet, while dance pushes the body to its limits, puppetry can explore what lies beyond those limits. ''Both dance and puppetry use movement as a means of communication,'' says the performance artist Dan Hurlin, who teaches dance and puppetry at Sarah Lawrence College and who will be presenting two new works in this year's festival. ''I always tell my students not to use the puppet like a microphone. Is it really necessary that your puppets talk? Any given puppet can do only a limited number of things, and if you don't have to waste precision on the jaw, you can do far more with the figure.''</p>
        <p>Like many others who are performing this year, Mr. Hurlin visibly shares the stage with his puppets. The miracle here is that you so believe in the life of the inanimate object that you keep your eye fixed there rather than on the puppeteer.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, the performer uses his own body and the body of the puppet, giving an object motions he cannot make himself in what Cheryl Henson calls a ''gestural ventriloquy.''</p>
        <p>''You have a kind of freedom, practical and aesthetic, that has parallels in film but none in live performance,'' she explains.</p>
        <p>David R. White, who has presented puppetry at Dance Theater Workshop, where he is the director, has also worked closely with festival organizers. ''There's always a kind of uncertainty in dance about who's in charge,'' he says. ''Dancers talk about what they contributed and whether they get credit. Puppets don't talk about that. They reveal a kind of God-in-the-machine aspect of the social contract.''</p>
        <p>Choreographers have given human beings a grace that lifts them above the human, and puppeteers give human grace to inanimate objects. ''At a great dance performance,'' Ms. Henson says, ''you are often distracted from a dancer's humanity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. White says: ''You are already suspending disbelief when you accept a toe shoe as a foot, when you allow for the proscenium. Puppetry goes the rest of the way. It allows you to examine what life can exist when the humanity is eliminated. In this time of rapidly developing technologies, puppets are engineering with a human face. Puppetry is a mechanics of being.'' And Mr. Hurlin adds, ''Puppetry is a three-way mirror of design, engineering and dramaturgy.''</p>
        <p>IN his ''Aesthetics,'' Friedrich Schiller speaks of how the ''shapeless gesture'' and ''the confused noises of perception'' begin to ''obey a rhythm and weld themselves into a song.''  ''Gesture'' is the most popular word among practitioners of high puppet arts, and it is the honing of gesture into a series of astonishing rhythms that makes for the success of this work.</p>
        <p>Though they can appear compellingly fragile, figurative puppetry and nonfigurative-object theater are robust media for formal abstraction. This year's festival is full of meanings and stories, but it is also a cavalcade of beautiful movement for much of which language is only a backdrop. It is a great leap outward, startlingly different from and enchantingly similar to the conventions of modern dance -- as radical and fresh as the first inventions of Martha Graham or Isadora Duncan.</p>
