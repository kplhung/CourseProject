      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial Observer by Verlyn Klinkenborg laments unproved faith in Iowa, his home state, that only way for agriculture to prosper is for farms to become bigger and bigger; says there are now 96,000 farms, in state that once had 215,000 farms; says indisputable result of large-scale corporate farming in Iowa has been depopulation of countryside; says state is now considering plan to encourage immigration to stop the steady dwindling of its labor force</p>

        <p>Iowa isn't a crowded place. It wasn't crowded when I was growing up there in the 1950's and early 60's, and it isn't crowded now. In 1960, when I was in third grade, the state population was 2,757,537 and still slowly climbing, as it had been all century, until it reached a peak of just less than three million people in 1980.</p>
        <p>Yet things haven't been as static in Iowa as these figures suggest. The way that Iowa isn't crowded has changed. The number of third graders has plummeted, and the population as a whole has gotten older. The percentage of the population over 80 is larger in Iowa than in any other state. Iowa is the only state besides Florida with more people over 75 than under 5.</p>

        <p>Iowa isn't a crowded place. It wasn't crowded when I was growing up there in the 1950's and early 60's, and it isn't crowded now. In 1960, when I was in third grade, the state population was 2,757,537 and still slowly climbing, as it had been all century, until it reached a peak of just less than three million people in 1980.</p>
        <p>Yet things haven't been as static in Iowa as these figures suggest. The way that Iowa isn't crowded has changed. The number of third graders has plummeted, and the population as a whole has gotten older. The percentage of the population over 80 is larger in Iowa than in any other state. Iowa is the only state besides Florida with more people over 75 than under 5.</p>
        <p>That is one of the reasons the state -- which has nearly always experienced annual net migration losses -- wants to encourage immigration. A plan to do just that, produced by a bipartisan governor's commission called the 2010 Committee, has caused an uproar in a state that is overwhelmingly white. In fact, the commission's report merely recognizes a demographic reality. Without immigration, the state's labor force will steadily dwindle. The only reason Iowa's population has not fallen further is because of immigrants who have come from Mexico, Vietnam, Bosnia and elsewhere. The greatest demand for labor comes from industries like meat packing.</p>
        <p>The population problem in Iowa isn't merely that its residents are getting old and its young people are leaving. The problem is tied directly to the character of agriculture in the state. In 1960 there were 174,707 farms in Iowa, down from a peak of around 215,000 in 1930. Last year there were about 96,000 farms, though the amount of farmland in cultivation had barely changed. There are 15 million hogs in Iowa, but they are raised on fewer than half as many farms as just a decade ago.</p>
        <p>It can be hard to grasp the implications of a shift that large. Think of a farm, for a moment, not as a tract of land or so many acres of corn and soybeans. Think of a farm instead as a constellation of people, each of whom has ties to a local community -- to churches and schools, to banks and farm-implement dealers, to co-ops and Lions Clubs. In 1960, small towns were thriving not on the prosperity of town residents alone but on the prosperity -- and the population -- of farms in the adjoining countryside.</p>
        <p>Now half of those farms are gone, their groves cut down, their houses bulldozed, their constellations of people dispersed. Year by year, the size of farms increases and their work force diminishes. The towns are very quiet, except the ones lucky enough to hear the roar of enormous grain driers at the elevator out by the railroad tracks. School districts have consolidated, and small-town business is just a ghost of itself. It is not uncommon to come across a sense of disinheritance among Iowans, especially those living in small towns. The bond that tied them to the farmland around them -- a bond that was social as well as economic -- has to a striking degree been severed. There is no one on the farms, and the towns have no one to serve except their aging residents.</p>
        <p>All of this has come about because of a faith -- an unproved faith -- that the only way for agriculture to prosper is for farms to become bigger and bigger. There is no question that Iowa raises vastly more corn and soybeans than it did in 1960. But at what cost? Farm prices are as low as they have ever been, and farmers now pray for emergency funding from Congress the way they pray for rain. One of the indisputable results of large-scale corporate farming in Iowa has been the depopulation of the countryside. An agricultural job in Iowa is now a meat-packing job, highly dangerous, badly paid and emblematic of an approach to farming that will serve Iowa's new immigrants as badly as it has served its longtime residents.</p>
