        <p>FOURTEEN years ago, when Tony Meloni was setting up his immigration advocacy office on Steinway Street, he thought he would introduce himself to his neighbors at Alex's Deli.

        <p>FOURTEEN years ago, when Tony Meloni was setting up his immigration advocacy office on Steinway Street, he thought he would introduce himself to his neighbors at Alex's Deli. Naturally, he asked for Alex. But Alex was, in fact, Alexandria, Egypt, the native city of the owners, Mohammed, Maunir and Eddie.</p>
        <p>At the time, this stretch of Steinway Street between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard, was a sleepy, even depressed group of blocks adjoining a retail district just to the south. But gradually a community of Egyptian and other North African immigrants, attracted by the area's low rents, began to invest in the neighborhood quietly, opening spice shops, Islamic gift stores, specialty cafes and a mosque.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meloni said the first Egyptians arrived in Astoria roughly 20 years ago, though immigration really began to soar in the mid-90's shortly after Congress passed legislation that benefited countries like those in North Africa.</p>
        <p>The most visible sign of Astoria's Egyptian and North African community is the proliferation of sheesha cafes, named for the mix of flavored tobacco and molasses smoked in hookahs. The ritual makes the cafes an anomaly even in multiethnic Astoria.  Egyptian and Tunisian immigrants, for whom sheesha is a recreation, are joined by people from Morocco and Algeria at cafes' sidewalk tables where they play backgammon, drink Turkish coffee and smoke.</p>
        <p>With the opening of El Sawkariah, his six-month-old sheesha cafe on Steinway Street, Said Ahmed sought to bring a piece of his native Cairo to Astoria, where he lives.</p>
        <p>''Mostly the Egyptian cafes here are like those in Egypt,'' Mr. Ahmed said. ''The stores are very tiny, and outside they have like 15 chairs, with people sitting outside in the fresh air.''</p>
        <p>Ali El Sayed is the chef and owner of the Kabab Cafe, one of the first Egyptian businesses to open in the area, and one that does not offer sheesha. After running a restaurant in Manhattan for five years, he sought an affordable place where he could replicate the familial warmth of his native Alexandria and experiment with his first love, Egyptian cuisine.</p>
        <p>Today the Kabab Cafe sits side by side with a handful of Egyptian and other North African restaurants, including ones owned by Moroccan and Tunisian immigrants.</p>
        <p>There are several halal meat stores owned mostly by Egyptian immigrants. Yemeni-Americans run a small gift shop, and one of the block's largest businesses is the Lebanese El Mannara, which specializes in imported Middle Eastern foods.</p>
        <p>The boldest addition to the neighborhood is the two-month-old Mombar, with artwork by Moustaffa El Sayed, Ali's brother, who is also the chef. Moustaffa El Sayed recalled a recent evening at Mombar.</p>
        <p>''Last week we had four girls, three of them were Egyptian -- two from Long Island, one from Westchester and one from Connecticut,'' he said. ''Where they live, they may be the only Egyptians within two miles. They want to come and see a place like Egypt, like Alexandria.''</p>
