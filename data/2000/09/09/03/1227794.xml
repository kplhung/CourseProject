        <p>This was a day of high legal drama, as a last-minute government maneuver thwarted defense efforts to free the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee on bail and left the federal district judge hearing the case, James A.

        <p>But if there was a lesson about Judge Parker in the episode, it was conveyed in his unemotional willingness to simply follow the letter of the law, even as the defense lawyers accused the prosecutor of effectively turning a hearing here into a diversion while he surreptitiously filed the appeal.

        <p>This was a day of high legal drama, as a last-minute government maneuver thwarted defense efforts to free the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee on bail and left the federal district judge hearing the case, James A. Parker, suddenly on the sidelines as the action leapt to an appeals court in Denver.</p>
        <p>But if there was a lesson about Judge Parker in the episode, it was conveyed in his unemotional willingness to simply follow the letter of the law, even as the defense lawyers accused the prosecutor of effectively turning a hearing here into a diversion while he surreptitiously filed the appeal. Judge Parker simply noted that the appeals court's one-sentence order had taken the issue out of his hands, and left it at that.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker, 63, a lanky, understated, Jimmy Stewart-like figure, is no judicial activist. In a lengthy interview this morning in his chambers, an ''I Love Fishing'' sign and framed family pictures on the shelf behind him, he described himself as a conservative Republican; indeed, he was appointed to the bench in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan. He made it clear that he was quite comfortable making even unpopular decisions if he felt they were supported by a strict reading of the law.</p>
        <p>And that is why, he added, he has not hesitated in issuing a string of bold decisions in Dr. Lee's national security case. Among them were the  decisions granting bail to the scientist and ordering the government to hand over thousands of pages of classified documents to see if they supported the defense's assertions that Dr. Lee was unfairly singled out for prosecution for mishandling nuclear weapons secrets because of his Chinese ancestry. Both struck harsh blows to the government.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they were difficult decisions because they were perceived to be against the interests of the government,'' said Judge Parker, in a rich, throaty baritone that carries a twangy residue of his upbringing in Texas. ''They were difficult because they were close, but the law seemed clear.''</p>
        <p>Expanding only slightly on his philosophy, he said later in the conversation, ''My role is to follow the rules as established by the higher level courts.''</p>
        <p>Today was actually Judge Parker's first day as chief judge of the federal district of New Mexico. But if the courtroom blasts seemed to mark an inauspicious start, Judge Parker showed none of it. The two sides had had their day in court, and that seemed to satisfy the judge.</p>
        <p>Laura Cordero, an assistant United States attorney in Washington and one of his first law clerks here, said that two of his more remarkable qualities were his insights into human behavior and his prairie-lawyer spirit in believing wholeheartedly in the importance of giving people their day in court, even if that means allowing lawyers to go on and on, as he has frequently in Dr. Lee's case.</p>
        <p>''He's an unusually fair man,'' Ms. Cordero said. ''He truly believes in giving everyone their day in court and letting them have their say. I know there were lots of times I would have cut off people long before he did.''</p>
        <p>Judge Parker gave a lengthy interview to a reporter here this morning, and then continued the conversation about topics like fly fishing -- particularly the relative merits of the five different kinds of trout to be found in a wild stretch of the Pine River -- and his belief in the need for more mediation in criminal trials as he offered a tour of the palatial, sun-drenched offices that he will soon be occupying.</p>
        <p>Although it was a series of random accidents that landed the case of Dr. Lee in his court, Judge Parker expressed fascination with the issues involved, particularly the way scientists operate. He even paused for a moment to reflect on what he perceived to be the core values of the scientific mind.</p>
        <p>''The pursuit of knowledge is paramount,'' he said. ''Their lives are not like yours or mine. They're seeking pure scientific knowledge. I recognize that they need free expression with scientists anywhere in the world to do that.''</p>
        <p>Judge Parker grew up in Houston and received his undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from Rice University, then went to the University of Texas law school. Although he does not seem to be a man given to spontaneous decisions, that was essentially what brought him to New Mexico.</p>
        <p>He said that after law school he was interested in moving to Phoenix and had arranged some job interviews there. The airline had no direct flights, so he had to stop in Albuquerque. At the urging of a law professor, he used the time to literally walk in cold at some law firms. Things worked out.</p>
        <p>He eventually spent several decades working for the largest law firm in New Mexico, Modrall, Sperling, Roehl, Harris &amp; Sisk, and specialized in civil litigation, particularly medical and legal malpractice cases.</p>
        <p>Since becoming a judge, he has handled a number of complex cases, but none in the area of national security or nuclear secrets. Among the more high-profile cases he has handled was one in which he effectively ordered the state to improve or shut down its systems for caring for the mentally disabled. Following his ruling, the state shut them and created community care centers instead.  Other cases have involved the immensely complex laws surrounding the usage of water from the state's rivers.</p>
        <p>The personal stamp he has brought to Dr. Lee's case has been his willingness to give all sides a chance to have their say. Twice he allowed what had been expected to be brief bail hearings to drag on for three days.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the information being brought out in open court is for the use of the press rather than my use, but I recognize the national interest,'' he said.</p>
