        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In John B. Judis's thoughtful review (July 9) of my father's book, ''C. Wright Mills: Letters and Autobiographical Writings,'' which I edited with my sister, Pamela, he points out that letters that would have invaded the privacy of living people were not published, a decision he finds ''understandable'' though regrettable. The individuals involved are not public figures and their privacy rights are protected by law.</p>
        <p>The letters that we did publish generally fall into two categories: first, they contain facts that help make the collection serve as an informal autobiography; and second, they show Mills's thoughts and feelings in a powerful and evocative way. The second category involves letters that show Mills's humor, lyrical expression and zest for life as well as his capacity for sustained moral outrage, incisive political analysis and what Mr. Judis calls his ''legendary combativeness,'' a trait we believe we have amply documented.</p>
        <p>Mr. Judis expresses disappointment that the book did not include letters about Edward Shils's review of ''The Sociological Imagination.'' However, we did publish letters regarding an earlier conflict between Shils, his former associate Hans Gerth, and Mills. Readers who wonder about the personal tone of Shils's animosity against Mills should find a clue in the letters we published. As for Mills's notes to Lionel Trilling, the story of their brief correspondence is told in Dan Wakefield's introduction.</p>
        <p>Other battles illustrated in this volume include Mills's conflict with his former thesis adviser, Howard P. Becker; his opposition to American policies toward Cuba; and his ''sociological brawl'' with what he called ''Abstracted Empiricism'' on the one hand and ''Grand Theory'' on the other. I suggest that anyone interested in reading more on Mills's arguments with certain approaches to social studies read the reissued edition of ''The Sociological Imagination.''</p>
