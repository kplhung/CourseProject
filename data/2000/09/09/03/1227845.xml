        <p>More than 20 vehicles, including dump truck, fire engine, police cruiser, ambulance and mail truck, will be put on display at second annual Wheels Go 'Round fund raiser for Rye Free Reading Room in Rye, NY; drawings (By the Way column) (S)</p>

        <p>If you have a toddler who adores trucks, you're going to love the ''Wheels Go 'Round'' fund-raiser for the Rye Free Reading Room on Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>Children will be able to explore more than 20 vehicles, including a dump truck, fire engine, police cruiser, ambulance and mail truck.</p>
        <p>''Last year we had a Hummer limousine that was very popular,'' said Meg Stackpole, assistant children's librarian.</p>
        <p>The event came about last year, she said, when the newly formed library auxiliary committee was looking for a way to raise money. ''One member had attended a vehicle fair in Massachusetts,'' she said, ''and it seemed like a natural.''</p>
        <p>Each vehicle is provided at no charge and is accompanied by someone who can explain its use. For most vehicles, children can climb aboard and pretend to drive.</p>
        <p>Admission is $20 per family, and the event runs from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Rye High School Parking lot on Parsons Street.</p>
        <p>Last year, Ms. Stackpole said, the event drew 1,000 families and raised $21,000.</p>
