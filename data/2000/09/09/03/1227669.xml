        <p>IN conversations with experts about mobility problems, especially among the elderly, two themes almost always crop up. One is that the choices are scant when it comes to devices that help you get around: you can clomp along with a cane or a walker, or take to a wheelchair, which limits exercise. Second, many people who have trouble walking say they are most comfortable pushing a grocery cart, because it lets them move along with balance and stability.</p>
        <p>And, of course, there is the social unease that many elderly people experience when they use assisted-walking devices, especially ones that make the user feel or look awkward and clumsy. America, at least the one presented by a youth-obsessed Madison Avenue, is the land of joggers and rock climbers with little time or patience for anyone who is older and slower. That is in sharp contrast to other parts of the world, including Europe, where aging and its problems are not viewed as something to be hidden or ashamed of.</p>

        <p>IN conversations with experts about mobility problems, especially among the elderly, two themes almost always crop up. One is that the choices are scant when it comes to devices that help you get around: you can clomp along with a cane or a walker, or take to a wheelchair, which limits exercise. Second, many people who have trouble walking say they are most comfortable pushing a grocery cart, because it lets them move along with balance and stability.</p>
        <p>And, of course, there is the social unease that many elderly people experience when they use assisted-walking devices, especially ones that make the user feel or look awkward and clumsy. America, at least the one presented by a youth-obsessed Madison Avenue, is the land of joggers and rock climbers with little time or patience for anyone who is older and slower. That is in sharp contrast to other parts of the world, including Europe, where aging and its problems are not viewed as something to be hidden or ashamed of.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert L. Kahn, a co-author of ''Successful Aging'' (Delacorte Press) and professor emeritus of public health and psychology at the University of Michigan, says this nation's approach to mobility problems is characteristically American.</p>
        <p>''We go from walking to motorized devices like electric wheelchairs and carts, skipping intervening possibilities,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Enter the little-known rollator -- developed in Europe -- and its proponents, like Nick Thompson.</p>
        <p>A rollator looks like a sawed-off grocery cart with fat rubber wheels, bicycle handle bars and hand brakes. It helps people walk easily under their own power, over floors, sidewalks and grass. It even has a seat, in case the user needs to take a rest, and it folds up for storage in a car or on a plane. Though rarely seen in the United States, rollators are common in Canada and Scandinavia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, 39, a former lawyer, saw a picture of a rollator in 1989 and decided to start importing a line of models made by a Swedish manufacturer, Ahlberg A.B. His Pittsburgh company, NobleMotion, is the exclusive importer of the Ahlberg rollators, which sell for $364 to $450; an extra $35 buys an odometer to keep track of the miles walked. Medicare, he said, usually pays about $100 toward the cost of a rollator for those who are eligible.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hilary Siebens, associate director of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, saw one of Mr. Thompson's rollators seven years ago at a conference on strokes and ordered one on the spot for her patients.</p>
        <p>''It really allows for functional walking,'' Dr. Siebens said. ''Walkers are stop-and-start. With a rollator, patients can get an immediate sense of freedom.'' Some people can use rollators to get themselves moving again, and avoid spending up to $20,000 for two to three weeks of rehabilitative therapy, she said. ''Also, people are less resistant to a rollator,'' she said, ''because it is easier to use than a cane or a walker.''</p>
        <p>Despite virtually universal positive comments about the rollator, the last decade has been slow going for Mr. Thompson, who only last year increased his salary to $26,500 from $24,000. An investor backed out, and Mr. Thompson has had trouble spreading the word about his product, which is among several rollators being sold in what has been a very small market. But he has aggressively pressed on, handing out leaflets and giving demonstrations at grocery stores, malls and conferences. He has reached a point, he said, where his business is secure, if not booming; he hopes to pay himself $30,000 this year.</p>
        <p>Although he wants to make money, Mr. Thompson also views his efforts as a ''battle against sedentary habits.'' His company has a Web site and a toll-free telephone number (www.wheels4walking.com, 800 234-9255).</p>
        <p>''My customers are looking for products to help them,'' he said. ''If you enjoy walking with a grocery cart, here's a grocery cart that goes on the sidewalk, with hand brakes and a seat.''</p>
        <p>Among those who say they have been helped is Maxine Marx, 82, a self-described ''adorable old lady'' and retired casting director who is Chico Marx's daughter. She ordered one of Mr. Thompson's rollators several years ago and now uses it to get around her Manhattan apartment and to take occasional walks in Central Park.</p>
        <p>''It's a godsend,'' she said. ''It saved my life. Otherwise I would have to use one of those awful walkers. Whenever I see someone hobbling in the park, I always show them my rollator.''</p>
        <p>Not all the users are elderly.</p>
        <p>Tom Welch, 55, is a project manager for a dot-com start-up in Houston. Three years ago, he developed severe arthritis and was unable to work. A year and a half later, he discovered the rollator.</p>
        <p>''My goal when I was disabled for 18 months was to get vertical and get engaged in work again,'' he said. ''The rollator has helped me do this.</p>
        <p>''In this country, people have a cultural hang-up about using assisted-walking devices. So many just sit, or walk very, very poorly. They would be in much better shape with a rollator.''</p>
        <p>DR. KAHN says many studies have shown that that walking and exercise are crucial to the health and longevity of older people.</p>
        <p>The rollator, he said, ''keeps people on the move.''</p>
        <p>''It's good for those with strokes or Parkinson's disease, because it helps with balance,'' he added. ''A motorized wheelchair or cart can be a blessing if you have no other choice. But it's too bad if you go to motorized transportation when you still have the capacity to walk.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kahn, who is 82, doesn't need any assistance for his daily walks to and from his office or for his trips to a gym three times a week.</p>
        <p>''Regular exercise is like religion,'' he said. '''You need it every day.''</p>
