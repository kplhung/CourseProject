        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I feel especially well placed, as a close friend and colleague of Riccardo Muti's, to counter some of Bernard Holland's assertions in his article ''Muti Was the Wrong Man for the Philharmonic'' [Aug. 20]. Have people forgotten so quickly that during his tenure with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Mr. Muti gave the premieres of works by Shapey, Stucky, Rouse and Berio, as well as several works of mine, and presented works of Ligeti and Penderecki, among others? I don't think any of us would be put in the category of ''safely established 20th-century classics.'' Not yet, anyway.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muti premiered a piece of mine with the La Scala Philharmonic, and I attended the rehearsals in Milan. I have also attended more than a half-dozen performances at Il Teatro della Scala and can attest that the orchestra is as flexible and as malleable as any I know. So much for the double canard that orchestras in Italy range ''from mediocre to bad'' and that Mr. Muti has shown no interest in new music. In addition, Mr. Muti's repertory is not nearly as small as Mr. Holland characterizes it. Who else in recent years has championed the music of Scriabin so well, and not only performed it repeatedly but recorded it?</p>

        <p>Mr. Muti premiered a piece of mine with the La Scala Philharmonic, and I attended the rehearsals in Milan. I have also attended more than a half-dozen performances at Il Teatro della Scala and can attest that the orchestra is as flexible and as malleable as any I know.

In addition, Mr. Muti's repertory is not nearly as small as Mr. Holland characterizes it. Who else in recent years has championed the music of Scriabin so well, and not only performed it repeatedly but recorded it?</p>
        <p>If Mr. Holland believes he can tell what's in Mr. Muti's head by watching his body language, he is deluding himself. Mr. Muti gives little away in terms of his emotions and is rather reserved with people he does not know. It is unfair for Mr. Holland to assert his belief that Mr. Muti does not have ''a mystical bone in his body.''</p>
        <p>There are aspects of Mr. Holland's article that I do agree with totally; those are the observations about short-term music directors. The deleterious effect of largely absentee directors is a worldwide phenomenon, and I hope the pendulum will begin to swing back. The administrations in New York, Boston and Philadelphia have a golden opportunity to deal with this issue.</p>
