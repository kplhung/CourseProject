        <p>WHEN he went out for the Roosevelt High football team in Yonkers as a 10th grader, Saif Sabur stood 5 foot 6 and weighed 109 pounds. By his senior year, the figures were 5 foot 9 and 132 pounds -- and still his coach was afraid to put him in a game.</p>
        <p>''I definitely knew I was good, but too small,'' Sabur said. ''I dreamed of pro football, but I said, 'Well, I guess I'm too little.' ''</p>
        <p>But a funny thing happened to rekindle a dream. Sabur is now 6 foot 3 1/2 and 245 pounds and has been one of the stars of the semipro United Football League with the Mount Vernon Steelers. A late growth spurt, construction work and a dedicated weightlifting regimen have wrought a football metamorphosis.</p>
        <p>''It's taken a lot of years of building,'' Sabur, 27, a White Plains resident, said. ''I started lifting in 1988.''</p>
        <p>This was to be the season he put it all together, wrote a highlight film the pros could not ignore. But a sprained knee in the preseason turned out to be a small tear and last week he had knee surgery. He was home two days later.</p>
        <p>''I'll be on crutches three to four weeks,'' he said last weekend, ''and I've decided to take the season off and make sure I'm perfectly healthy. It's a setback, but by next year I'll have put on 20 more pounds of muscle, easy, and I'll be ready for a pro camp. It has to be next year; I'm not getting younger.''</p>
        <p>But he had been getting better.</p>
        <p>''Three pro teams have already shown some interest in him,'' said Ken Esehak, the coach, general manager and guiding force behind the Steelers, who opened their regular season two weeks ago. ''And one Arena League football team asked him to go to its camp, but he declined. He started with us at 215 pounds, and every year he's added muscle. He's been an all-star all four years he's played in this league.''</p>
        <p>But not in high school. Tony DeMatteo, Roosevelt's former coach, recalls Sabur as ''a terrific kid but frail.''</p>
        <p>''He didn't play a whole lot,'' DeMatteo said. ''I was afraid he would get seriously hurt.''</p>
        <p>A wide receiver in high school, Sabur has played tight end, defensive end and outside linebacker as a semipro, excelling at all three spots because of his strength, good hands and 4.5-second running speed for 40 yards. But it is as an outside rushing linebacker that he could have a pro future.</p>
        <p>''We have game films of him running down backs from across the field,'' said Esehak.</p>
        <p>''He plays the same way Lawrence Taylor did,'' he added, referring to the former great Giants linebacker. ''He runs down backs, he's extremely physical, extremely strong and extremely intense.''</p>
        <p>And, out of uniform, extremely different.</p>
        <p>''Off the field he's very quiet, extremely polite,'' Esehak said.</p>
        <p>Tim Lyons, a Steelers defensive tackle from Irvington who had played with Sabur for two seasons, noticed the same dichotomy.</p>
        <p>''He's phenomenal and ferocious on the field,'' Lyons said of Sabur, ''but he never fouls. And off the field, he's a perfect gentleman. He's just the nicest guy.''</p>
        <p>Opposing quarterbacks and ball carriers might not think so.</p>
        <p>Saif, in Arabic, means sword. ''I have a lot of rage inside,'' Sabur said, ''though I am a very humble man.''</p>
        <p>Rage?</p>
        <p>''Playing on defense you have to attack the man with the ball,'' Sabur explained. ''I want to make every play if I can -- that sort of rage: to attack the ball.</p>
        <p>''This is a contact sport. I don't believe in giving everyone a little hit -- 'Oh, you O.K.?' I always play hard, I am not afraid of anyone. And I will win.''</p>
        <p>Playing on the road fits Sabur's outlook. ''I love to play and win on the other team's field: conquer and leave.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Sabur said, his Steelers teammates have nicknamed him David Banner, which is the name of the alter ego of the raging comic book character the Incredible Hulk. ''I'm kind of like the Incredible Hulk'' he said. ''He gets angry, does his thing, then turns calm again.''</p>
        <p>While recuperating, Sabur has not ruled out another field in which he has worked: acting. A few years ago, he was one of the ''Fashion Police'' in a clothing store commercial.</p>
        <p>''I haven't done a whole lot, but I'm looking to jump back into the field,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Instead, next season he could jump into the pros, Esehak said. ''When we got him, he was still raw in terms of the pros,'' he said. ''When he's 100 percent again, he'll be ready.''</p>
        <p>FOR THE RECORD</p>
