        <p>The drinks are so strong at Glacken's Bar and Grill, they've bolted the foot rail to the top of the bar because it was doing no good on the floor.</p>
        <p>After two, the more fragile customers will return slowly to the bar with one eye closed aiming their empty cups at the wood, their free hands clutching for the brass.</p>
        <p>''You're here for one reason,'' explains Martin Glacken, the second-generation owner of the place and its morning bartender. ''You're here to drink. There's nothing else you can do.''</p>
        <p>His pouring method was developed 60 years ago by his late father, Mike. It is outrageous and is known from police headquarters to Rikers Island.</p>
        <p>A 12-ounce cup is filled with ice and set on the bar. Mr. Glacken then fills a three-ounce shot glass with the liquor of your choice. He dumps it into the cup of ice and with bottle still in hand, he continues the pour, raising the bottle to his ear and pausing for a moment before bringing it down for the top-off.</p>
        <p>A typical liter of liquor will produce 30 to 33 drinks in most bars. At Glacken's Bar and Grill they squeeze 10 drinks from a bottle.</p>
        <p>''We make it on volume,'' says Mr. Glacken, who bears a striking resemblance to his father in a painting that hangs above the bar among the bric-a-brac: the square jaw, Irish jowls, silver hair. His father wore a carnation for the sitting. Mr. Glacken wears an eyeglass case in his pocket.</p>
        <p>''We want to give a guy a fair drink,'' Glacken the Younger says. ''That's family tradition.''</p>
        <p>Most drinks cost $4. All prices include sales tax.</p>
        <p>Glacken's, at 149th Street and Walton Avenue in the South Bronx, is a no-frills sort of place, on a hill and half under ground. It has a cracked and sloping floor and the bar is topped with plywood. There are no latches on the bathroom door so people cannot stay a long time in there and do bad things.</p>
        <p>There is no trouble at Glacken's. The glasses are mostly plastic, there are no bar stools and beer is served in cans, because when the drinks are this strong the joint needs to be childproof. You must be 25 years of age to drink here.</p>
        <p>The customers come from the nearby sanitation garage, the post office, the community college, the Bronx Terminal Market and the neighborhood. They come for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
        <p>It is early in the morning and the patrons' faces show nothing. There is almost no sound except for Bob Barker on the TV and the noise that rolls in from the street when the door swings open. They stand next to the bar with their elbows on the folded newspapers. They stare at the bottles behind the bar.</p>
        <p>''This place is a landmark for a certain kind of New Yorker,'' says James Dallas, 74, who has been going to Glacken's for 35 years. ''One thing that's changed is that the drinks used to be 75 cents. One thing hasn't changed. You have two drinks, you're gonna walk outta here thinking this floor was straight.''</p>
