        <p>ISLAM</p>
        <p>A Short History.</p>

        <p>THE RENAISSANCE</p>
        <p>A Short History.</p>
        <p>By Paul Johnson.</p>
        <p>196 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Modern Library. $19.95.</p>
        <p>The pair of books under review introduces the Modern Library Chronicles, a new series of short histories intended for the ''general, nonspecialist reader.'' The publisher lists 19 forthcoming titles dealing with various historical topics, all the way from ''prehistory'' to ''freedom.'' Is this a promising way to attract new readers to history? Or mere pandering to the shortened attention span of television addicts? Time will tell, but the first two volumes are readable, opinionated essays, written from sharply contrasting points of view.</p>
        <p>Karen Armstrong approaches the history of Islam in a piously ecumenical spirit, declaring in her preface that human beings are ''religious creatures because they are imaginative'' and are therefore ''compelled to search for hidden meaning and to achieve an ecstasy that makes them feel fully alive.'' Muslims, she tells us, ''have looked for God in history''; their ''chief duty was to create a just community.'' For the adherents of Islam, politics ''was, therefore, what Christians would call a sacrament: it was the arena in which Muslims experienced God.'' After summarizing the ups and downs of Islamic politics and religion, she concludes: ''Islam kept the notions of social justice, equality, tolerance and practical compassion at the forefront of the Muslim conscience for centuries. . . . Western people must become aware that it is in their interests too that Islam remains healthy and strong. The West has not been wholly responsible for the extreme forms of Islam, which have cultivated a violence that violates the most sacred canons of religion. But the West has certainly contributed to this development and, to assuage the fear and despair that lies at the root of all fundamentalist vision, should cultivate a more accurate appreciation of Islam in the third Christian millennium.''</p>
        <p>That, needless to say, is what her book sets out to accomplish, and its readers will indeed be introduced to the persistent Muslim effort to make their society both just and holy. Other aspects of Muslim history -- economic, military, scientific, artistic and the like -- are almost entirely excluded. Religion, especially the aspects of religion of which Armstrong approves, occupies center stage; and when violent sects, like the medieval assassins, do figure in her account she is at pains to emphasize their marginality. Similarly, she skips over the mass slaughter of dissident Muslims perpetrated by the Ottoman sultan Selim I in preparation for his war against the Safavids in 1514, and rests content with the anodyne half-truth that the Ottoman ''government merely provided a framework which enabled different groups . . . to live together peacefully, each . . . following its own beliefs and customs.''</p>
        <p>A tract for the times, then? Indeed. Sound history? That rests in the eye of the beholder. What she says is almost always accurate if incomplete, and I found her account of the dedicated following that formed around the prophet Muhammad particularly fresh and powerfully persuasive. The later chapters are more cluttered and hurried, but her chapter ''The Arrival of the West, 1750-2000'' succeeds in making the problems of contemporary Islam acutely apparent.</p>
        <p>The central question in appraising her book is to ask, Was religion all that mattered to Islam's followers? Surely not. Muhammad's revelations from God were not all-encompassing, even in his own time, and most Muslims have had many other things to worry about and strive after. Nonetheless, Islam was and remains a powerful factor in the consciousness of believers, and Armstrong's account of what that faith required and how its adherents tried to adjust its precepts to ever-changing circumstances is a valuable corrective to the hostile caricatures of Islam that circulate in the English-speaking world. By devoting her chronicle to correcting such errors, Armstrong has produced a work of history that while somewhat lacking in balance is engaging, provocative and often persuasive.</p>
        <p>The same may be said of Paul Johnson's unabashedly old-fashioned account of the Renaissance. Adhering to the venerable model established by Giorgio Vasari in his 1550 study, ''The Lives of the Artists,'' Johnson divides his book into successive chapters on the achievements of writers, sculptors, architects and painters. These chapters abound in interesting details and idiosyncratic judgments. They also offer a few convincing insights.</p>
        <p>In his introductory chapter, Johnson lists and dismisses earlier renaissances and then explains how the Renaissance got started in Italy. Thanks to new technologies, he writes, ''In the later Middle Ages, wealth was being produced in greater quantities than ever before in history. . . . As wealth accumulated, those who possessed it gratified their senses by patronizing literature and the arts.'' On top of that, ''thousands of workshops . . . producing a growing variety of luxury goods and machinery'' trained skilled artists, thus provoking ''the huge expansion of culture that marked the beginnings of the early modern age.'' Wealth, patronage and workshops combined to permit individual genius to flower and set the Renaissance on its meteoric path.</p>
        <p>Johnson is keenly aware of technology's influence on artistic expression. His remarks about the importance of goldsmiths' skills for both sculpture and painting struck me as novel and convincing, and his more extended discussion of the stylistic implications of fresco as against oil painting is even better. Here is Johnson on the use of the canvas: ''Once an artist could make a living from painting smallish canvases or panels on his easel, he could go in for portraits, then as now one of the most remunerative forms of art. He could either carry his easel about with him or work from his studio -- where he could more readily get models, including nude ones, male and female, to sit for him -- and above all he could escape from the time-consuming tyranny of wall painting. That involved much less church work. . . . A further result, since the artists escaped from the tyranny of palace walls too, was to break the aristocratic and princely stranglehold on art patronage and allow the rising bourgeoisie a look-in.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, some of Johnson's judgments are merely eccentric. ''Gothic'' he opines, ''was a habit, an impulse, not a system. It had no theory and no literature. It was a sophisticated evolution from a primitive instinct.'' Byzantine art fares no better: ''a static, moribund tradition, from which Italian artists in the Middle Ages had to struggle to free themselves.'' And Johnson's discussion of the invention of perspective navely assumes that ''the artist is striving to create illusion,'' so that Giotto's best work marks ''the emergence of genuine pictures as we understand them today.'' Oddly, he writes as though 20th-century artists had yet to rebel against the illusionistic norms of the Renaissance.</p>
        <p>The art and literature of Italy between 1300 and 1600 may indeed be the principal heritage from that time and place that concerns us today. But just as religious striving for holiness does not constitute the whole of Muslim history, the accomplishments of individual writers and artists do not constitute the whole history of the Italian Renaissance. Johnson skips the political and military staples of traditional history entirely, and dismisses religion as resolutely as Armstrong emphasizes it.</p>
        <p>Yet both authors write with flair and intelligence. And what they leave out allows them to achieve the brevity their editors imposed upon them. Does it follow that brevity and well-balanced history are mutually contradictory? Do short histories require writers to concentrate on one or another aspect of the past and exclude everything else?</p>
        <p>I do not accept that conclusion, having recently tried to distill the history of the whole wide world into a very brief compass. Every work of history -- even the most prolix and extended -- omits far more than it includes. Historians always have to decide what was important and choose their words accordingly. A really incisive idea about what mattered most -- a theory of historical change, in short -- may allow a historian to write briefly and still achieve a better balanced portrait of the past than either of these books offers. But since neither Armstrong nor Johnson sets out to explain everything in the light of a theory of historical change, it's unfair to reproach them for failing to do so. Whether brevity requires such radical lopsidedness remains an open question.</p>
