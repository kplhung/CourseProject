        <p>If you like the sound of Papa Roach's single ''Last Resort,'' you'll probably enjoy the band's debut album, ''Infest,'' and their live performance, which maintains the same sledgehammer energy.</p>
        <p>Whether they are singing about suicide (''Last Resort'') or Attention Deficit Disorder (''Thrown Away,'' which actually turns into a pretty quasi-reggae track), the high-testosterone band's pummeling, often explicit, songs contain different themes, but the same sonic buzz-saw approach. Even the sometimes introspective lyrics move at breakneck speed.</p>

        <p>If you like the sound of Papa Roach's single ''Last Resort,'' you'll probably enjoy the band's debut album, ''Infest,'' and their live performance, which maintains the same sledgehammer energy.</p>
        <p>Whether they are singing about suicide (''Last Resort'') or Attention Deficit Disorder (''Thrown Away,'' which actually turns into a pretty quasi-reggae track), the high-testosterone band's pummeling, often explicit, songs contain different themes, but the same sonic buzz-saw approach. Even the sometimes introspective lyrics move at breakneck speed.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Coby Dick, the band's frontman, Papa Roach has developed a following with a sound incorporating the elements of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, Korn and Alice in Chains, blending it into a mostly persuasive whole that might not always be as good as those parts. Papa Roach will be performing at the Stone Pony, in Asbury Park, at 7 p.m. Monday.</p>
