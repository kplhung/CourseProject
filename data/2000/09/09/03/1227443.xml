        <p>CRUISE ships were involved in 87 confirmed cases of illegal discharges of oil, chemicals, garbage or plastic in United States waters from 1993 through 1988,  the General Accounting Office said in a report to Congress in February. What's more, some cases involved illegal discharges numbering in the hundreds.</p>
        <p>That report, together with several high-profile cases in which cruise lines were fined for polluting waters in Alaska, the Caribbean and elsewhere, did little to inspire public confidence in industry statements that cruise lines were doing their best to protect the environment.</p>
        <p>Yet federal and state officials say that many ships have improved waste management and other environmental procedures. The G.A.O. report concluded that 72 percent of those illegal cruise-ship discharge cases in United States waters were accidental, and noted that their number declined from 24 in 1994 to 9 in 1998.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is persuaded by the G.A.O. figures or by the cruise industry's vows that it is committed to protecting the environment. Many environmentalists say that the reason there appear to be so few violations is that there is little enforcement and even less monitoring.</p>
        <p>''The cruise ship industry has to bring down violations to zero before anybody should give them credit,'' said Dr. Russell Long, executive director of the Bluewater Network, a San Francisco organization concerned with protecting waters and ecosystems. ''Otherwise it's like a lawbreaker telling a judge that even though he's committed a lot of serious crimes, he deserves praise because he's working to do better.''</p>
        <p>But other environmentalists hail the recent turnabout by the cruise industry. ''A lot has changed in the culture of cruise lines,'' said Michael A. Conway, who coordinates cruise-ship compliance for the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. ''They're working hard to comply and they've been very responsive.''</p>
        <p>One area that almost everybody agrees needs improvement was at least partly addressed in July when the Senate passed a bill containing an amendment pushed by Senator Frank Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, banning the release of untreated black water (sewage) or hazardous chemicals anywhere in Alaska's Inside Passage and tightening rules for the release of treated black water and gray water (water from sinks, showers and basins). The bill must still be approved by the House.</p>
        <p>Even without the amendment, cruise lines operating in Alaska agreed last winter not to discharge garbage, refuse and untreated sewage in the Inside Passage, and not to discharge waste into ''doughnut holes,'' areas beyond the three-mile limit but within the inside waters of Southeast Alaska. (The Murkowski amendment, too, would prohibit ships from dumping waste water into doughnut holes.) They have also agreed to have the Coast Guard monitor their overboard discharges and send samples to an independent laboratory to be tested.</p>
        <p>In March the 15 members of the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association, which includes the leading ship lines, signed a memorandum of understanding with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection promising, among other things, to embrace new technology in managing waste and designing environmentally friendly ships.</p>
        <p>While some critics view voluntary compliance as a stratagem for fending off stricter regulation, Mr. Conway of the Alaskan environmental office said that such agreements can avoid political wrangling that might otherwise mean taking several years to get rules enacted.</p>
        <p>For whatever reasons, cruise lines do seem to be embracing environmental protections that go beyond the merely cosmetic, ranging from having environmentalists aboard to ''zero discharge'' policies even where certain discharges are allowed. Some ships have installed computerized systems and recorders to track hazardous and chemical wastes and monitor smoke and water emissions. Most have eliminated or cut down on plastic cups, straws, even individually packed condiments. Crystal Cruises, which has extensive policies for safeguarding the environment, uses recycled paper for printed items and is experimenting with soy-based inks. Princess Cruises said its policy to reduce the use of plastic has resulted in a reduction of seven million pieces of plastic waste a year.</p>
        <p>Carnival, the world's biggest cruise line, has agreed to install a monitoring device in its Carnival Triumph this month to collect ocean data in the Caribbean and transmit them to the University of Miami, whose scientists developed the device. Carnival is also working with a Finnish company to develop a low-pollution diesel engine.</p>
        <p>Royal Caribbean's Radiance of the Seas, scheduled to sail in Alaska, the Caribbean and Hawaii beginning next spring, will be powered by gas and steam turbines that the line says will reduce exhaust emissions by 80 to 90 percent. Holland America said that all five ships on order for delivery through 2005 will be outfitted with cleaner-burning propulsion technology estimated to reduce fuel consumption, and thereby emissions, by as much as 40 tons a week.</p>
        <p>Yet whatever the cruise industry's progress in safeguarding the environment, Mr. Conway said it is necessary to keep up the scrutiny to prevent backsliding and to be sure that laws adequately protect the environment and human health.</p>
