        <p>BEFORE the nuclear-powered attack submarine U.S.S. Memphis embarked on a recent spy mission -- in which, Navy officials have said, it captured the sounds of the explosions that helped sink Russia's Kursk submarine last month -- one unsettling precaution was taken. A bright orange rescue buoy, designed to shoot to the surface and summon help if the Memphis got in trouble, was welded down and rendered unusable.</p>
        <p>This was standard practice during the cold war, when the Navy feared that the inadvertent release of a buoy could tip off the Russians to the presence of an American spy sub and set off an underwater chase. It also reflected the grim acceptance among submariners that if a serious accident occurred in hostile waters, they probably were not coming back. But now that the two nations are friendlier, times have changed. Or have they?</p>
        <p>The Kursk disaster, with the loss of all 118 men on board, has cast a harsher light on the secrecy that has continued to define submarine operations on both sides. It has also raised the question of whether a little less cloak and dagger -- and more cooperation among seafaring nations -- could go a long way toward improving the safety of those on board the vessels.</p>
        <p>Old habits die hard. News reports in Russia last week suggested that the Kursk might have been secretly testing a powerful new torpedo when it sank in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12. That might help explain why Russian leaders delayed seeking rescue assistance from the West, even though a few crew members might have remained alive for two or three days inside the wrecked hull.</p>
        <p>American authorities believe a torpedo accident caused two explosions aboard the Kursk, with a huge blast from the torpedo's warhead ripping a hole in the submarine. Pentagon officials said last week that the Memphis and another American submarine recorded the explosions while secretly monitoring a Russian naval exercise.</p>
        <p>It is natural that the United States Navy wants to keep an eye on the Russian navy. But the United States has sharply cut back the frequency of surveillance missions since the end of the cold war, and the Russians rarely go to sea anymore. So, some critics ask, why should American submariners still be restricted in their ability to seek help if a fire or flooding were to cripple their vessel?</p>
        <p>Submarine officers have said that if an accident occurred, they would be much more willing to surface in international waters near Russia than they used to be. American subs also carry a tiny communications buoy that can be ejected to transmit an S O S signal for up to 18 hours. But even if they called for help, who would be there to rescue them?</p>
        <p>American officials have said it would have taken two or three days for them to rush divers and rescue craft to the scene, or about the same amount of time that it took the British and Norwegians to get there.</p>
        <p>One solution would be for the world's leading submarine navies to work together to build a new generation of rescue vessels and position them around the globe. Some Western navies have already modified their old rescue equipment to work with the American gear. Experts say Russia will need to cooperate more if such a rescue network is going to work.</p>
