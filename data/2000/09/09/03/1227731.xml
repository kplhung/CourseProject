        <p>This country needs more public education and debate about religion -- its relation to values, not all of which are automatically good, to a world view and institutions.</p>
        <p>There are more ways to lead a spiritual and ethical life than allegiance to one or another of the traditional organized religions. People need the freedom to criticize those aspects of the organized religions that discriminate and oppress.</p>

        <p>Proclamations of faith hinder that process, and instead encourage an either/or mentality (either you are one of us or you are not) rather than creating a context for a fuller, more open discussion of the variety and range of spiritual possibilities.</p>
