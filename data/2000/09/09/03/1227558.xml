        <p>FIFTY years ago tomorrow, a college kid named Beetle Bailey was introduced to comic strip readers in a dozen newspapers. He was first seen that day heading for Rockview University with his buddy, Freshman.  As they reach the campus, Freshman asks Beetle about his luggage and Beetle holds up a toothbrush. Freshman then asks what Beetle proposes to do about clothes. ''Haven't you ever heard of roommates,'' Beetle said, thereby setting the tone for the ensuing decades.</p>
        <p>The strip was the creation of the 27-year-old World War II veteran Mort Walker, a transplanted Kansan who has been drawing Beetle Bailey in first Greenwich and later Stamford for 48 years. The strip is in about 1,800 newspapers, which, Mr. Walker said, makes Beetle Bailey the fourth most widely distributed comic strip of all time, after Blondie, Peanuts and Garfield.</p>

        <p>FIFTY years ago tomorrow, a college kid named Beetle Bailey was introduced to comic strip readers in a dozen newspapers. He was first seen that day heading for Rockview University with his buddy, Freshman.  As they reach the campus, Freshman asks Beetle about his luggage and Beetle holds up a toothbrush. Freshman then asks what Beetle proposes to do about clothes. ''Haven't you ever heard of roommates,'' Beetle said, thereby setting the tone for the ensuing decades.</p>
        <p>The strip was the creation of the 27-year-old World War II veteran Mort Walker, a transplanted Kansan who has been drawing Beetle Bailey in first Greenwich and later Stamford for 48 years. The strip is in about 1,800 newspapers, which, Mr. Walker said, makes Beetle Bailey the fourth most widely distributed comic strip of all time, after Blondie, Peanuts and Garfield.</p>
        <p>''Walker was significant because he introduced a simpler style of drawing than we'd had up until then,'' said Robert Harvey of Champaign, Ill., the author of ''The Art of the Funnies'' and ''The Children of the Yellow Kid.''</p>
        <p>''Before 1950, the gag strips like Blondie had some detail while the adventure strips, with continuing stories like Terry and Steve Canyon and Dick Tracy had a more complex drawing style,'' Mr. Harvey continued. ''But Beetle, who came along in September 1950 and Peanuts, a month later, changed the way comics looked and that was important because newspapers wanted comics that were small but easy to read.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker began his career as a cartoonist selling single-panel cartoons to magazines like the Saturday Evening Post. John Bailey, his editor at the Post, noted that the young man was doing cartoons about things he knew little about and suggested he do a strip about college. He did and named Beetle after his editor.</p>
        <p>But Beetle wasn't in college very long. Nine months after that first strip, he joined the Army and was sent to Camp Swampy, commanded by Amos Halftrack, the general who has spent the decades fretting because the Pentagon doesn't keep in touch. Beetle's enlistment was an act of desperation as the strip had only 25 clients and was in danger of being dropped by its syndicator, King Features. The Korean War was then in its second year and college students like Beetle had to pass a deferment test to avoid the draft until graduation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker, 77, said he remembers the editor of The Philadelphia Bulletin telling him ''they're drafting college goof-ups like Beetle. Why don't you put him in the Army?'' He did, and circulation soared.</p>
        <p>''Humor strips dominated what were called the funny papers early in the century, but by the 1920's and 30's, adventure strips had taken over,'' Mr. Walker said. ''With Beetle Bailey, I revived the funny part of the funny papers, and I'd be proud to be remembered for that.''</p>
        <p>Jerry Dumas of Greenwich, who has worked with Mr. Walker for 45 years while doing a comic strip, children's books and novels on his own, said Beetle Bailey has succeeded for so long because ''it deals primarily with working, playing, eating and sleeping. That means it can be understood and related to by people all over the world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker attributes the strip's success, at least in part, to the humorlessness of the old United States Army, the Army he knew from his World War II service in Italy that hadn't changed much in the immediate postwar era. In the early 1950's, Stars &amp; Stripes, the Army newspaper, gave Beetle Bailey a circulation boost when it dropped the strip because of its alleged lack of respect for officers. The press, then staffed by lots of World War II veterans with long memories, had a wonderful time attacking military censorship. Mr. Walker said about 100 new newspapers subscribed to the strip shortly after the controversy.</p>
        <p>The next pop in circulation came in 1970 when Mr. Walker integrated Camp Swampy by introducing an African-American officer, Lt. Jack Flap. Mr. Walker said that Stars &amp; Stripes, which had resubscribed, dropped the strip again for a time, telling him it feared an increase in racial tensions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker is especially proud of how he has diversified his formerly all white Army over the years. In addition to Lt. Flap, there are the Asian Corporal Yo, the Italian Private Rocky, the Frenchman Killer, as in lady killer, and the brainy Greek private, Plato. Then there are the women he has added to what was once this man's Army, most notably the sexy Miss Buxley, the object of General Halftrack's dreams, and Miss Blipps, the secretary who does most of the work. When women's groups criticized the general's attitude toward Miss Buxley, the cartoonist provided the general with some sensitivity training. Even the old Army stereotypical noncommissioned officer and Beetle foil, Sgt. Orville P. Snorkel, now has a mild love interest in Sgt. Louise Lugg.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the Army has come to understand and appreciate Beetle Bailey and Mort Walker. He said it is because the Army has matured even though Beetle hasn't.</p>
        <p>In May, Mr. Walker was invited to the Pentagon to receive the Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service, the highest award the Secretary of the Army can give to a civilian. He has also been honored by the Association of the United States Army and the Noncommissioned Officers Association for helping to raise funds for the planned World War II Memorial on the Mall in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker initially decided to live and work in Fairfield County ''because so many cartoonists lived here and still do.''</p>
        <p>His Stamford home and studio, with its 30-foot ceiling and 15 skylights, was once the home of Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of Mount Rushmore. Mr. Walker also spends part of the year in his home and studio in Boca Raton, Fla.</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Walker works on Beetle with two of his sons, Brian of Wilton, Greg of Cos Cob and Mr. Dumas, who contribute the plot lines or, as Mr. Walker calls them, ''the gags.'' The four get together once a month to review the gags, vote on which to use and tweak them before those selected are made into finished strips. Mr. Walker's other comic strip, Hi and Lois, is written by his sons and illustrated by Chance Browne of Wilton, who also draws Hagar the Horrible. Mr. Walker and his wife, Catherine, have 10 children between them from previous marriages and six of the children are involved in the daily production of Beetle and Hi and Lois.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harvey calls Mr. Walker ''the great collaborationist.''</p>
        <p>''He has operated a cartoon assembly line with a stable of artists and writers working on Beetle, Hi and Lois and other cartoons over the years while Schulz did all the Peanuts gags and drawings himself,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This month, the University of Missouri, Walker's alma mater, is mounting an exhibition of original daily and Sunday strips in the grand concourse of its Elmer Ellis Libray. On Nov. 11, Veterans Day, a retrospective exhibit commemorating the 50 years will open in the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Boca Raton. Mr. Walker was one of the founders of the museum, which opened in Greenwich in 1974. Mr. Walker's autobiography, ''Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook: Celebrating a Life of Love and Laughter,'' will be published in October and a Beetle Bailey musical is in development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker said he does not intend to retire because, as he explained it, ''old cartoonists never retire, they just erase away.''</p>
        <p>This means Beetle, at 68 or thereabouts, is likely to continue his military career, which isn't so farfetched. He still has a way to go to approach the record of General Winfield Scott, who joined the Army in 1808, in plenty of time to fight in the War of 1812, and didn't retire until the start of the Civil War, 53 years later.</p>
