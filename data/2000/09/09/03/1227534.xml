        <p>AFTER working all day at the Book Mark Cafe in Oyster Bay, Liz Roosevelt, 69, a retired history teacher from Cove Neck, stopped by the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club in Centre Island to pump water out of her 28-foot ketch, Glory. Nearby, 10 fellow club members played croquet on the artificial grass tennis courts. Diane McGaw, a 40-ish temporary employment agency owner with homes in Oyster Bay Cove and Manhattan, nursed a drink on the clubhouse's broad veranda. By the dock, Gary Van Dis, 47, of Brooklyn, the corporate creative director for Conde Nast, and Mark DeNigris, 47, a dentist from Lloyd Neck who came to the club by boat, puffed on cigars.</p>
        <p>''It's a lot of fun to be here,'' said Ms. Roosevelt, a distant cousin of Theodore Roosevelt. The president was also a member of Seawanhaka, that oh-so-swanky Gold Coast club just across the water from his summer White House, Sagamore Hill. ''We're a sailing club. I like the feeling of being out on the water and being able to get around on it. I like the challenge of figuring out how to beat somebody else when I'm sailing.''</p>
        <p>So, it seems, does everyone at  Seawanhaka.</p>
        <p>The exclusive image of the grande dame of yacht clubs, its members say, is not based on social register status or the cedar-shingled mansion that serves as its clubhouse on 12 acres, but on their sailing prowess.</p>
        <p>The aura, Ms. Roosevelt said, is ''because of the amount of sailing and the events that we do, not the names that belonged.''</p>
        <p>Yes, the king of Norway is a member. Roosevelt entertained dignitaries in Seawanhaka's salons, where members relax amid the sea air, the scent of old money and scotch straight up in the wood-paneled bar, which did not admit women until 1987. Another Roosevelt descendant, Stephen Jeffries, 39, of Boston, visits once a year to help with the regatta. The club's collection of half-hull yacht models trails only the New York Yacht Club's in size, covering the walls of the Model Room. The collection of sterling silver cups, trophies its yachtsmen have won in racing competitions, include two Olympic gold medals.</p>
        <p>Until the wind died that afternoon, crews were jibing and tacking in 23-foot sloops called Sonars across Long Island Sound, just north of Oyster Bay Harbor. They were competing in the Rolex Thompson Cup, an international women's match racing regatta hosted by the yacht club. Among the 12 four-woman teams were Seawanhaka members Dru Slattery, 41, of Marblehead, Mass., ranked ninth among female skippers in match racing worldwide, and one of her crew, Heidi Benjamin, 38, of Norwalk, Conn.</p>
        <p>Other teams came from Bermuda, Britain, Italy, Germany, New Zealand, Denmark and France. All the skippers are ranked in the top 30 worldwide. The competitors race in identical boats; the matches are a test of sailing skills, not vessel design.</p>
        <p>''I love sailing and Seawanhaka's a great club,'' Ms. McGaw said.''You want to belong to a club that offers you, in terms of sailing, activities and facilities, from the dining room to the hoist. You go out, do what you love -- race -- and come back and sit on the porch with your friends. It's a club that has a wonderful history. To be part of it is an honor.''</p>
        <p>To join, prospects must be nominated by two other members to the club's board of trustees. After reviewing letters of recommendation, the club may invite them to join.</p>
        <p>Many of Seawanhaka's 480 members have raced in the America's Cup and done the Bermuda races and trans-Atlantic courses. Competitions are regularly held with clubs from Scotland and England. The Seawanhaka International Challenge Cup, established in 1895 for small yachts, is run every two years and is one of the oldest international sailing competitions to originate in North America. Similar to the America's Cup, it is open to amateurs only.</p>
        <p>Seawanhaka was founded in 1871 aboard a 41-foot sloop owned by William L. Swan that was anchored off Centre Island. Mr. Swan enjoyed sailing his own craft in an era when gentlemen hired professional skippers and crews and watched the races as sport. The club's 12 founders, all amateurs, would skipper, crew, rig and maintain their own vessels, said Ian McCurdy, 51, of Oyster Bay, the club's vice commodore and a second-generation yacht designer. His father was also a commodore at the club. Seawanhaka is believed to be the first entirely Corinthian, or amateur, yacht club in the world.</p>
        <p>There are about 75 yacht clubs along both sides of the Sound from Port Jefferson and Groton to Manhattan, Mr. McCurdy said, each with its own emphasis and style. Seawanhaka has 150 moorings; nearly all the vessels are powered by wind. Here, motorboats are tres declasse.</p>
        <p>''Seawanhaka has always been a club for people who like to sail their own boats and work on their own boats,'' said Mr. McCurdy, pointing out his black-hulled sloop, Selkie. ''The question that is asked is what are your sailing credentials? If a candidate's not a sailor and really wants to come for dinner, we don't want them. Everyone is a sailor in this club and the talk is about sailing.</p>
        <p>''''At Seawanhaka, there are people who have sailboats that are expensive,'' he said, ''but that alone won't make the club work. We try to be open. Everyone thinks it's the bloodline. I must admit it helps you. The old-boy network does work. But it's sailing. ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Roosevelt learned to sail as soon as she could swim and joined the club's junior program as a child. She usually crews for others when she has time off from the bookstore, and she relishes night races to Stratford Shoal, a lighthouse in the middle of the Sound. But even she remained an associate member from 1962 until women were admitted in 1983.</p>
        <p>Priscilla Constants' life has always revolved around boats, cruising and racing. Ms. Constants, 38, of Lattingtown, is the first female club secretary and a member of its race committee. Her father joined Seawanhaka before she was born and she spent her first 19 summers on a 42-foot sailboat, navigating and setting a course long before her first kiss. She started racing at age 20 and met her husband, Alfred, at a regatta in Newport. They were both sailing J-24's, 24-foot sloops with keels.</p>
        <p>''The club is constantly changing and evolving,'' Ms. Constants said,  referring to design developments and the shift from J-24's to Sonars, not the makeup of its membership. ''I think people always assume, 'Oh, a yacht club,' and think it's hoity-toity. At a yacht club you don't get people coming out in white slacks. You go to a country club out here and you have to have the whole attire.</p>
        <p>''This is a community. When you race together, it is very intimate. It's not like a tennis foursome or a golf foursome. It's not snotty. There is a prerequisite. You have to like boats, whether it's racing them or sailing them.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Constants noted that membership fees, at $3,000 a season, are a fraction of those at many country clubs. Of course, that doesn't include the boat, though the Sonar class is relatively inexpensive. Sonars cost $22,000, fully fitted.</p>
        <p>Only a quarter of the membership is second or third generation. N. J. Burkett, 38, a WABC-TV reporter with a passion for sailing, joined six years ago.</p>
        <p>''It's a special place,'' Mr. Burkett said, proud of the formal parties held more than half a dozen times a year, complete with orchestras playing in the clubhouse and members dressed in formalwear. ''It's a lyric in a Cole Porter song or a page out of Fitzgerald. It's a timeless place.</p>
        <p>''This place defies the stereotypes in many ways. People have all kinds of hobbies and things in their lives. What people have in common is the love of the water and the love of sailing. There are motorcycle clubs and golf clubs and yacht clubs. This is what we do.''</p>
