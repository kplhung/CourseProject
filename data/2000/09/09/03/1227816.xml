        <p>The coach wondered how his quarterback would react if he got off tentatively in his first start for Notre Dame. ''What happens when something goes wrong?'' Bob Davie said the other day. ''Just how resilient is he going to be?''</p>
        <p>Late in the third quarter of today's 24-10 victory over No. 25 Texas A&amp;M, Arnaz Battle answered Davie in front of 80,232 people at Notre Dame Stadium, who could tolerate the smothering heat far better than another humiliating 5-7 season. Behind by 3 points to in the teams' season opener, plenty was going wrong for the Fighting Irish.</p>
        <p>For much of the game, Battle looked like a quarterback who threw only 35 passes in two seasons as a backup -- he hit receivers on their rumps with ill-timed tosses, scampered into sacks and looked as if he were wilting in the 108-degree temperature on the field.</p>
        <p>There was a nifty 70-yard drive at the end of the first half that hinted at Battle's gift for running the option: he ran for 17 yards and found Joey Getherall in the corner of the end zone for a 9-yard score. But too often the Irish offense was stalling. Now, with Notre Dame behind, 10-7, in the third quarter, the offense was stalling again, this time on the Aggies' 46-yard line, and Battle was admittedly frustrated.</p>
        <p>He glided right as if to run, stopped and heaved a pass. Streaking down the right sideline was Javin Hunter, the junior split end. Hunter leaped across the goal line to snag his first touchdown at Notre Dame, a 46-yarder. Battle was halfway there to meet him to celebrate his first touchdown pass at the school and the game's pivotal play.</p>
        <p>''I came out a little shaky,'' Battle said after completing 10 of 16 passes for 133 yards and 2 touchdowns to go with 50 yards rushing. ''I wanted to make something happen. I was thinking about running, then I saw Javin was one on one with the corner. I was able to lay it out there for him.''</p>
        <p>In that one play, Notre Dame found a quarterback and a way to get past the Aggies. It also relieved the pressure on Davie for at least a week, until top-ranked Nebraska comes here.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination,'' said Davie, the Aggies' former defensive coordinator, who beat his friend and mentor, A&amp;M Coach R. C. Slocum. ''They helped us out by dropping some passes, and I understand we have huge question marks, especially about our secondary. But it was a gut check and we came out of it.''</p>
        <p>Battle might have never gotten his chance if the Aggies had not squandered a 75-yard drive that took up half of the third quarter. They had the ball on the Irish's 2-yard line and four plays to get a touchdown.</p>
        <p>But the Notre Dame defense stiffened. Twice, it corralled Joe Weber behind the line of scrimmage for 2-yard losses, and then stopped Ja'Mar Toombs six inches short of the goal line. On fourth down, the Aggies committed an illegal procedure penalty and settled for Terence Kitchens's 23-yard field goal to make it 10-7.</p>
        <p>''We let the opportunity slip away,'' Slocum said. ''We didn't get the ball in the end zone, and the next thing you know they get that big pass.'' Battle followed his quick-strike touchdown with a more measured 12-play, 69-yard touchdown drive. Julius Jones finished it off with a 17-yard burst up the middle for a 21-10 lead. But what made Jones's run possible was Battle's magic on third-and-19 on the Irish's 46. Once more his swift feet bought time for him to throw a bullet deep to David Givens.</p>
        <p>''I hadn't been making those plays in fall practice,'' Battle said. ''But I think what I do best is get out of the pocket and see what's downfield.'' By the time Battle moved the Irish 49 yards to set up a 32-yard field goal by Nick Setta, Davie had moved on to another question. This time it was directed more at his coaching staff than at his quarterback. ''He's explosive,'' Davie said. ''Now we need to find the best way to use him.''</p>
