        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Sidewalk Toilets Get City Money. That's the Easy Part'' (Aug. 6): Instead of having smelly, garish advertising kiosks taking up valuable city street space, why not have accessible public toilets in every police station?</p>
        <p>The illegal use issues (like drug-taking or sex) would be circumvented. A number of other issues could be addressed if not resolved, like the schism between the police and the community. I don't know how far $100,000 would go in renovating the lobby of a station house while making a public handicapped-accessible toilet. But many of the precinct houses could use some lobby renovation. Shouldn't these public servants have a beautiful home base?</p>

        <p>Perhaps these renovations could be effected through design submission awards and an ''adopt a precinct'' program as we have with highways.</p>
