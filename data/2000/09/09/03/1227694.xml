        <p>TOYOTA is a very successful automaker, of course, and it got that way by making its brand synonymous with dependability.</p>
        <p>Think of the Corolla, built in a joint-venture factory with General Motors in California; the car's Toyota nameplate has made it a far better seller than the virtually identical Chevrolet Prizm built on the same production lines by the same workers.</p>
        <p>Unlike many foreign automakers, Toyota recognized that many Americans really like the kinds of cars that Detroit offers. It set out to make them, and to make them better.</p>
        <p>Want a comfortable family sedan? Try the Camry, a quieter and far more reliable version of Mom's old Fairlane. You want to recapture the sense of arrival that Dad had when he got the big raise and moved up from an Impala to a LeSabre? Try the Avalon, with its cloudlike ride and optional bench seats. Want a hushed, soothing luxury car without the firm suspension and serious road feel of the Mercedes E-Class? The Lexus LS is waiting quietly for you.</p>
        <p>This year, Toyota is back with another marketing marvel: a midsize convertible at a reasonable price. It won't knock the socks off serious drivers. Indeed, it won't knock off anybody's socks, but that's just the point. The Toyota Camry Solara convertible captures the sense of effortless, tamely glamorous fun in the sun that so many middle-aged, middle-class adults yearn for.</p>
        <p>The Solara convertible is, literally, a variation of the Solara coupe. Each convertible begins as a semifinished coupe plucked from the production line at Toyota's factory in Cambridge, Ontario. Then it is shipped to a nearby plant of the American Sunroof Company, a parts supplier that makes more than a million convertible tops annually.</p>
        <p>The well-designed power top is installed, complete with glass rear window, and some metal is added to stiffen the frame. Then the car goes back to Cambridge for painting.</p>
        <p>Since any freshly minted Solara is, in effect, available for factory conversion, ever-eager-to-please Toyota offers the convertible in all three Solara flavors. The base SE model ($25,550 for 2001, including delivery charge) comes with a 2.2-liter 4-cylinder engine borrowed from the Camry, with 16 valves and a horsepower rating of 135. Standard are a four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission, air-conditioning, halogen headlights, a stereo system with cassette and CD players, power windows, power locks and what Toyota calls ''woodgrain-style accents.''</p>
        <p>The SE V6 ($28,490) gets you, no surprise, the 3-liter V-6 from the Camry, with 24 valves and 200 horsepower, plus antilock brakes. The top-line SLE V6 ($30,970) adds leather, a power driver's seat, 16-inch aluminum wheels (instead of 15-inchers), a JBL sound system, remote locking and, alas, a stubby spoiler on the rear deck.</p>
        <p>Side air bags are a $250 option. A traction control is a $300 option, but only on the SLE.</p>
        <p>The black-leather interior of the SLE V6 test car was handsome and functional, if a little fussy and old-fashioned-looking compared with the latest designs of several European manufacturers. The front seats are nothing special, but the rear seating is a marvel of ergonomic design. Access is easy and egress even easier, thanks to a foot pedal that one can use to slide a front seat forward. Two adults can sit in the back in relative comfort, in spite of the space commandeered for the power-roof machinery. Still, the trunk is adequate for a couple of suitcases and a set of Callaway clubs.</p>
        <p>About that convertible top: The American Sunroof Company did its job very well. Flip two levers, press a button and there is the sky. Getting the top back up and locked in place is just as carefree. With the roof up, visibility is, by the standards of convertibles, excellent. And, again measured in relative terms, the wind noise with the top closed is subdued.</p>
        <p>But this is a car, not a cabana, and the driving experience counts, too. The V-6 has enough power, but is nothing to brag about. I wouldn't have high hopes for the 4-cylinder version. Toyota doesn't publish acceleration times, but Car and Driver magazine recorded an 8.2-second figure for a 0-to-60 sprint in the Solara V-6 coupe. That seems about right for the SLE convertible, too.</p>
        <p>The handling, too, was adequate but not overwhelming. The Solara is no embarrassment at the speed limit on a curvy road, but front-wheel drive, all-weather tires and a relatively soft suspension make it quick to protest attempts at hard cornering.</p>
        <p>My guess, though, is that these shortcomings will matter little to potential buyers. The real competition to the SLE V6 is not the lithe (and roughly $6,000 more expensive) BMW 323Ci convertible, but the very American (and roughly $3,000 less expensive) Chrysler Sebring JXi. And nobody buys a Sebring for the way it handles.</p>
        <p>Toyota certainly knows how to build serious cars for serious drivers -- think of the Lexus GS 400. The Solara convertible shows that the company also knows how to make a car for middle-aged Americans who want to add some sunshine to their long commutes and their weekends in the country.</p>
