        <p>THE BLIND ASSASSIN</p>
        <p>By Margaret Atwood.</p>
        <p>521 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $26.</p>
        <p>Nearly 20 years ago, in speaking of her craft, the novelist Margaret Atwood observed that ''a character in a book who is consistently well behaved probably spells disaster for the book.'' She might have asserted the more general principle that consistent anything in a character can prove tedious. If we apply the old Forsterian standard that round characters are ones ''capable of surprising in a convincing way,'' Atwood's new novel, for all its multilayered story-within-a-story-within-a-story construction, must be judged flat as a pancake. In ''The Blind Assassin,'' overlong and badly written, our first impressions of the dramatis personae prove not so much lasting as total.</p>
        <p>The setup and setting are promising enough. This is chiefly the story of the Chase sisters, Iris and Laura, granddaughters of the benevolent founder of a button factory in the Canadian town of Port Ticonderoga. The girls grow up in the 1920's in a large 19th-century house named Avilion after the ''island-valley'' in ''Idylls of the King.'' After their war-wounded father exchanges his religious faith for disreputable rambles in Toronto and their mother dies of a miscarriage, the girls are more or less raised by Iris's old nursemaid, Reenie, a starchy font of home truths and old saws.</p>
        <p>Iris is the older and more sensible of the two sisters; Laura the more alluring and ungraspable. ''Laura touches people,'' Iris explains. ''I do not.'' With her capacity for sudden, passionate attachments to people and beliefs, the younger sister is a bafflingly nervy girl who gets away with things: ''Laura had such a direct gaze, such blankly open eyes, such a pure, rounded forehead, that few ever suspected her of duplicity.'' Iris is obliged to watch out for her, and on one occasion even stops Laura from drowning herself. This stagy moment, as Iris recalls it, allows for the stark juxtaposition of one girl's self-destructiveness with the other's suppressed resentment:</p>
        <p>''I couldn't get out of my mind the image of Laura, in the icy black water of the Louveteau -- how her hair had spread out like smoke in a swirling wind, how her wet face had gleamed silvery, how she had glared at me when I'd grabbed her by the coat. How hard it had been to hold on to her. How close I had come to letting go.''</p>
        <p>The Chase girls' childhood -- tutors, kitchen conversation, factory picnics -- is played out at great length, and while social information should be more highly prized than it is in the modern literary novel, Atwood sometimes operates with the indiscriminate retrieval of an Internet search engine set to ''display all.'' In the last decade, she has been able to keep things moving in her short fiction (some of the stories in ''Wilderness Tips'' are terrifically economical), but her novels have bogged down in repetition and clutter. The previous one, ''Alias Grace,'' reads like a tale told twice within itself.</p>
        <p>When the Depression lays siege to the economy, even Mr. Chase's paternalistic ways can't save the button factory from labor unrest. The building is damaged by a fire apparently set by Alex Thomas, an orphan and ex-divinity student of shadowy origins, a prematurely hard-bitten figure whom the teenage Chase girls proceed to hide in the cellar and the attic. Here the novel most strongly exhibits its peculiar blend of the low and high, like a Nancy Drew story written by one of the Bronts. ''I didn't see him at first; he was behind the apple barrel. Then I could make him out. A knee, a foot. 'It's all right,' I whispered. 'It's only me.' ''</p>
        <p>Economic rescue is extended to the Chases by the heavy hand of Richard Griffen, a competing industrialist and rising right-wing politician who scorns the mollycoddling employment practices of the girls' father. Eighteen-year-old Iris is presented to this cardboard villain like a fee and readied for the wedding by Richard's brittle, ambitious sister, Winifred, the novel's most appealingly awful creation, a sort of Miss Murdstone with plucked eyebrows. In the event, the groom seems more interested in the willful 15-year-old Laura, who goes to live with the Griffens after her father's death but is soon running away or getting into trouble at school or being dispatched to an asylum.</p>
        <p>Laura dies -- we learn this on page 1 -- in 1945, at the age of 25, when her car plunges off a Toronto bridge. She leaves behind a science-fiction novel, ''The Blind Assassin,'' which becomes a great posthumous success. Atwood's enveloping novel of the same name alternates between the aged Iris's narration of all the aforementioned events and extracts from this book, whose interplanetary matter is presented as a story being told by a hard-bitten fellow on the run to a young woman who steals hours with him in his various hideouts: Alex Thomas and Laura Chase, we presume.</p>
        <p>The less said about Planet Zycron the better; Atwood, alas, says plenty. She lengthily taxonomizes the city of Sakiel-Norn and its class-stratified inhabitants. (''The Snilfards dressed luxuriously and were connoisseurs of music. . . . The smallholders, serfs and slaves were called the Ygnirods.'') But she proves unable to relieve the reader's tedium with the place's kinkier features, like children who weave carpets until they are blind and then go on to become throat-cutting hired killers. (''Their sense of hearing was acute.'')</p>
        <p>Despite her assertion in a recent interview that this new book's fantasy material has its roots in popular prewar genre magazines, Atwood seems to be sleepwalking through a Doris Lessing phase, or exercising once again her own allegorical bent, most famously displayed in ''The Handmaid's Tale.'' Still, even though we're told that ''Earth was colonized by the Zycronites,'' and even though Iris's situation bears an indisputable resemblance to that of Zycron's sacrificial maidens, the two parts of Atwood's big new book feel like separate projects that have been soldered together rather than thematically connected. Worse still, nothing in either part gives a reader much desire to forge connections through inference.</p>
        <p>We are assured by the aging Iris that Laura's ''Blind Assassin'' has given her sister's memory a certain cult status: fans leave offerings at Laura's grave and make graffiti from her novel's sayings; academics take a serious interest in the text. Iris tends her sister's flame with traces of the ambivalence she once showed in rescuing Laura from the Louveteau River and comments on the difficulties of her own aging with an endless, rote sourness that seems more adolescent than geriatric. This is a novel in which spring arrives when ''dog doings unfreeze, then wane,'' and a newborn has ''that squashed face, as if she'd hit a wall at high speed.'' Things tend to let Iris down twice, and the reader is spared neither disappointment. When in Rome, she finds the Colosseum ''looking like a mouse-eaten cheese'' and the Tiber ''yellow as jaundice.'' She recalls how a long-ago lettuce ''tasted like pale green water. . . . tasted like frost.'' One starts to dread the approach of each common noun. Just as everything in the novel is relentlessly overproved, so is Iris endlessly characterized by these baleful observations.</p>
        <p>Adding to an extraordinary stock of rhetorical irritants is Iris's tic of etymologizing or parsing the obvious: ''That's my trousseau, I thought. . . . It sounded like trussed''; ''I considered the word warn''; ''Laura had finally snapped. Snapped, she said, as if Laura was a bean.'' One also comes up against Atwood's peculiar tendency to mint similes whose vehicles are more obscure than what they're describing: ''yeast fermenting, going straight to her head like warm helium.'' Some bread is said to be ''white and soft and flavorless as an angel's buttock.'' Unless, I suppose, you've also had a wing.</p>
        <p>Toward the end, when Iris isn't being reflexively querulous or coarse, the narration settles for phoning things in. ''I couldn't make sense of this. I was feeling quite dizzy'' is the sort of sloppy wrap-it-up writing one doesn't expect from someone of Atwood's stature. The answer to the book's chief matter of suspense -- the source of the Zycron stories -- answers itself so obviously and early that Iris, while disclosing the truth in the book's last pages, feels obliged to concede to the reader, ''You must have known that for some time.''</p>
        <p>Atwood has said that ''Writing is like life in that you don't know where you are until you look back.'' Unlike life, however, writing provides the opportunity to revise or abandon a journey even after it's been taken. Which might have been the best course here.</p>
        <p>Thomas Mallon's novels include ''Henry and Clara,'' ''Dewey Defeats Truman'' and, most recently, ''Two Moons.''</p>
