        <p>After two months of sporadic eruptions and frequent, earth-shaking tremors in an island chain south of Tokyo, officials today ordered the complete evacuation of Miyake Island, which has been at the center of the seismic activity.</p>
        <p>The evacuation, ordered almost simultaneously by the mayor of Miyake, and by the governor of Tokyo prefecture, comes after almost half of the island's 3,850 inhabitants had quietly left the island to escape what has become near-constant volcanic activity.</p>

        <p>After two months of sporadic eruptions and frequent, earth-shaking tremors in an island chain south of Tokyo, officials today ordered the complete evacuation of Miyake Island, which has been at the center of the seismic activity.</p>
        <p>The evacuation, ordered almost simultaneously by the mayor of Miyake, and by the governor of Tokyo prefecture, comes after almost half of the island's 3,850 inhabitants had quietly left the island to escape what has become near-constant volcanic activity.</p>
        <p>''This decision was made because the earthquakes and eruptions have become so frequent that they represent a risk to human lives,'' said Keita Takashima, a spokesman for the Tokyo government.</p>
        <p>The evacuation marks the second time in recent months that volcanic activity has forced large-scale relocations in Japan. Earlier this year, 13,000 people were evacuated from villages in northern Japan near Mount Usu, after a major eruption of a volcano that had been dormant there for 22 years.</p>
        <p>Since it lies only 120 miles south of the capital, Tokyo, the eruptions of Mount Oyama on Miyake have revived fears here of a huge disaster in the case of a major earthquake. Several powerful tremors have been felt in the capital itself, with one of them reportedly caused by movements in the earth's crust deep below the city.</p>
        <p>Experts say that the frequent tremors and eruptions on Miyake, and throughout the surrounding Ise island chain, have made this summer one of the most seismically active seasons on record.</p>
        <p>Scientists say that the seismic activity in the Ise chain is caused by shifts in huge underground pools of magma, but there is disagreement among them over its relevance to Tokyo's tectonic stability.</p>
        <p>These fears are reinforced by the still vivid memories of the devastation of Kobe, a major port city southwest of Tokyo that was struck by a violent earthquake in 1995.</p>
        <p>Friday was also the anniversary of the great Tokyo earthquake of 1923, which killed an estimated 150,000 people and left most of the city burned to the ground.</p>
        <p>Partly as a result of the Kobe quake, the Tokyo government has organized its largest annual emergency preparations drill on Sunday, which is traditionally held at the beginning of September, to commemorate the huge quake that destroyed this city.</p>
        <p>For the first time, the prefectural government has called out more than 7,000 members of the Self-Defense Forces, including members of its air, sea and maritime branches, for highly visible drills that include military-style rescue maneuvers involving helicopters, light tanks, troop transport vehicles and landing craft.</p>
        <p>The drills have fueled a major polemic here in a Japan, which remains officially pacifist and without an army, about the role of the Self-Defense Forces. Antimilitarists here say they suspect that an unstated goal of the high-profile exercise is to  raise the profile of the armed forces gradually, improving the prospects for conservative proposals to revise the Constitution to allow Japan to form an army for the first time since World War II.</p>
        <p>The debate over the exercises has also involved complaints that it is aimed at intimidating foreign Asians who reside in Japan after menacing comments five months ago by Tokyo's governor, Shintaro Ishihara.</p>
        <p>''Many third-country nationals and foreigners who have entered Japan illegally have perpetrated heinous crimes,'' Mr. Ishihara said in April. ''In the event of a major earthquake, riots may break out, and there is a limit to the police's ability to cope with such a situation alone. I want you, the Self-Defense Forces, to carry out your mission, not only to deal with natural disasters, but also to maintain law and order.''</p>
        <p>In fact, historians were quick to reply, thousands of Koreans were lynched and their property stolen or destroyed by rioting Japanese who had been whipped up by xenophobic local leaders during in the Great Tokyo Earthquake.</p>
        <p>Since those remarks, Mr. Ishihara has been forced to apologize to Japan's foreign Asians, and ever since, has played down the law and order element to the earthquake drill.</p>
        <p>''There were over 6,000 people killed by the Kobe earthquake, and we were all ashamed by the poor response to the emergency,'' said Atsuyuki Sassa, a security expert who has advised Mr. Ishihara. ''The Self-Defense Force is a national asset, and we must use it in emergency situations.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 5, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Sunday about the evacuation of the Japanese island of Miyake during volcanic eruptions referred incorrectly in some copies to the year a big earthquake struck Kobe, Japan. It was 1995, not 1985.</p>
