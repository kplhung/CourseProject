        <p>To emphasize that point, Mr. Middelhoff did not hire the Rockettes, but he did rent Radio City Music Hall.

        <p>''The employees are getting: 'What is the personality of our C.E.O.? For what is he staying and fighting? What to him is important?' '' Mr. Middelhoff said. The event will last two hours, including a video of interviews with Bertelsmann employees, a speech by Mr. Middelhoff and a question-and-answer session. No Rockettes, but there will be representatives of the company's German workers council.</p>
