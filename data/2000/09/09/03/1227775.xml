        <p>If you want to take first prizes, remember that quantity counts more than quality. It is the highest score that wins tournamaments, not who played the cleverest or most original game.</p>
        <p>In the Chesswise International Tournament at the Stratton Mountain Inn in Vermont, July 10 to July 16, the grandmaster Alexei Yermolinsky of El Cerrito, Calif., won an ingeniously played game against the Estonian grandmaster Jaan Ehlvest. And yet, Ehlvest outscored him to tie for first and second places with the grandmaster Pavel Blatny of the Czech Republic.</p>
        <p>Ehlvest and Blatny each tallied 6 1/2-2 1/2 and took home $5,500. Yermolinsky, with 6-3, tied for third to seventh places in the 25-player Swiss-system competition sponsored by Bill Goichberg's Continental Chess Association, the leading subsidizer of open tournaments on this continent.</p>
        <p>After 1 Nf3 Nf6, when Yermolinsky steered the game into an English Opening with 2 c4, Ehlvest chose the defense that is the rage right now: 2 . . . b6 3 g3 (White can head toward a Queen's Indian Defense with 3 d4, but apparently no one cares) c5 4 Bg2 Bb7 5 O-O g6 6 d4 cd 7 Qd4.</p>
        <p>After 9 Rd1, Yermolinsky had the ghost of a Maroczy bind. Any time he wished, he could materialize it with e4.</p>
        <p>After 16 Qd4, it is not obvious why Ehlvest did not counter with 16 . . .  b5! A Topalov-Kramnik blitz game in Wijk-aan-Zee last year proceeded 17 cb ab 18 Nb5 Rc1 19 Rc1 Qa2, with an equal position.</p>
        <p>After 19 Nd4, Ehlvest exposed no points on which Yermolinsky could profitably invade, but he was not satisfied to remain in his solid though passive position.</p>
        <p>Thus, his 19 . . . Rh5 was an attempt to get a little action going.</p>
        <p>After 20 g4!?, however, his rook could not get back to the exit with 20 . . . Rc5? because 21 g5 would win one knight or the other.</p>
        <p>After 21 Qd2, Ehlvest might have tried 21 . . . Ne4, but after 22 Ne4 Re4 23 f3 Re5 24 g5 Rd8 25 b4 a5 26 f4 Re4, it is not clear whether he will be able to extricate his rook; although the immediate 27 Bg2? fails against 27 . . . Rd4!</p>
        <p>Yermolinsky refused to win a pawn with 24 Qd6, presumably because 24 . . . Bf3!? 25 ef Qf3 26 Qb6 Qh3 27 Qc5 Ng4 creates fine attacking chances for Ehlvest.</p>
        <p>His 26 . . . h6? was intended to lift Yermolinsky's pressure. Still, after 27 hg, White had a pawn controlling important squares in the neighborhood of the black king.</p>
        <p>After 33 Bg4, threatening 34 h4 and 35 h5, Ehlvest had to try for counterattack with 33 . . . b5. However, this uprising was quelled by Yermolinsky's 34 ab ab 35 c5!</p>
        <p>After 38 Nd3, Ehlvest could not exchange queens with 38 . . . Qe5 because 39 Ne5 Bd7 40 c6 Bc8 41 Nb5 Rb8? 42 c7 wins outright.</p>
        <p>After 40 . . . Kh7, Yermolinsky struck with 41 Be6! Ne6 42 Ne6 fe 43 Qe7 Kh6 44 Rd4.</p>
        <p>If 44 . . . g5, then 45 Qe6 Kg7 46 Qc6 is annihilating. Ehlvest gave up.</p>
