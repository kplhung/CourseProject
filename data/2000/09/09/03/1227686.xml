        <p>IN a few months, John F. Welch will step down as chief executive of the General Electric Company, leaving behind a remarkable 20-year run of earnings growth and near cultlike devotion. And the three front-runners to succeed this 20th-century business icon fit a pattern. All are gung-ho results-getters for the company -- and all are white men.</p>
        <p>In June, G.E. promoted three more executives who stand ready to replace any front-runner who bails out if he is not anointed as Mr. Welch's successor. These three, too, fit the mold: stellar growth-and-earnings producers, and all white men.</p>
        <p>Where are the women? The blacks? The Latinos? The Asians?</p>
        <p>Together, these groups make up about 40  percent of G.E.'s domestic work force, but they are not easy to find in the top executive corps of G.E., which is regarded in many management circles as America's most admired corporation. Just 6.4 percent of its  corporate officers are women, compared with an average of 11.9 percent for all the Fortune 500 companies, according to a 1999 survey by Catalyst, a nonprofit research and advisory group that studies women in business.</p>
        <p>Of the 20 businesses that provided 90 percent of G.E.'s earnings in 1999, only one is headed by someone who is not white: GE Industrial Systems has an African-American president and chief executive, Lloyd G. Trotter, who is also a senior vice president of the parent corporation.</p>
        <p>And the first woman to become chief executive of a G.E. business -- Sandra L. Derickson, at GE Capital Auto Financial Services -- left unceremoniously in 1999 after the fast-growing auto-leasing unit posted a sharp earnings decline and had to be restructured. A man replaced her.</p>
        <p>G.E. has had diversity on its agenda for at least three decades, and its efforts to retain women and minorities have intensified in recent years.</p>
        <p>''We have put a lot of programs in place to make sure that G.E.'s global diversity is real and lasting, and we measure our progress,'' Mr. Welch said. Responding to questions by e-mail, he conceded that G.E. isn't ''where we want to be yet,'' but pointed to current efforts to move more diverse talent through G.E.'s managerial ''pipeline.''</p>
        <p>Lest anyone think that Mr. Welch has gone touchy-feely in his final months at the helm, he stressed that diversity was a bottom-line necessity today.</p>
        <p>''Diversity isn't just a nice corporate program,'' he said. ''It's a business and a global reality. The 90's have been largely about global growth and going after the brightest minds, wherever they may be in the world.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I believe the future has never been better for a truly diverse G.E.''</p>
        <p>In the here and now, however, G.E.'s all-male and nearly all-white leadership slate raises intriguing issues. After all, it is no longer unheard-of for large American companies to be led by women or minorities -- American Express, Maytag and Hewlett-Packard are high-profile examples. Catalyst has measured steady annual increases in women corporate officers since it started counting in 1995, and Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm, reports a small but growing minority presence in American boardrooms.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Welch, G.E. has become a gold standard for management practices. Detractors may criticize its mass layoffs and chemical spills, but its managerial training and promotion practices inspire widespread praise and imitation. To many in corporate America, G.E. is a meritocracy par excellence -- a place where managers are judged on their ability to meet tough financial goals, not on whether they speak with the right accent, attended the right schools or had the right father.</p>
        <p>Why, then, the white, male leadership slate? Is there something about this acclaimed corporate culture that is inhospitable to women and minorities?</p>
        <p>Dozens of interviews with current and former G.E. managers turned up much agreement that G.E.'s efforts at promoting diversity had fallen short, at least until recently. But there was no unanimity about why. ''It really is a paradox,'' said Karen Nelson, a former GE Medical Systems marketing manager who served as the diversity director of that business from 1991 to 1994.</p>
        <p>SOME pointed to the company's practice of grooming talent through frequent relocations, saying that it was tougher on women, and unappealing to minority managers, who would have to drag spouses and children to parochial towns. Others said G.E.'s engineering history was the reason, arguing that today's statistics reflect the difficulties that all engineering businesses had in attracting women and minorities as trainees years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trotter, G.E.'s most senior black executive, thinks those theories let management, including himself, off too easily. ''If I had managed my business the way I had managed diversity, I think I'd have gotten fired,'' he said, noting that G.E. requires every business unit to be first or second in its market, or risk sale or closure. There is no such requirement for diversity.</p>
        <p>The priorities have now changed, Mr. Trotter said, adding that new measures to recruit and retain more African-Americans, designed by G.E.'s black managers themselves, were more likely to work. These initiatives, which have more recently been adapted by G.E.'s women, Latinos and Asian-Americans, pose no challenge to G.E.'s culture of meritocracy, but try to bolster participants' confidence, groom them for promotion and give them a better idea of how they fit into the corporate structure.</p>
        <p>Still, others who are knowledgeable about G.E.'s workings wonder whether diversity can be achieved within a system that prizes growth and earnings above all else.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nelson, for one, said that she savored the adrenaline highs of working in G.E.'s tough culture, but that she began to believe that this same culture was burning out the very women and minorities she was working so hard to recruit, to say nothing of herself.</p>
        <p>''I would get four hours of sleep a night,'' recalled Ms. Nelson, who gave birth to her second child while serving as diversity officer for the United States, Canada and Latin America. ''I was traveling so much I knew all the porters in the airport by their first names. I would stagger home at midnight and get back up at 4 a.m. We had staff meetings at 7:30 in the morning, and you had to be there.''</p>
        <p>G.E. tried to accommodate Ms. Nelson, granting a postpartum ''family leave,'' and letting a nanny bring the baby to the office for midday feedings. But Ms. Nelson knew that accommodations could hurt as well as help, suggesting special treatment in a system that values a lean and mean image.</p>
        <p>Increasingly troubled by work-family conflicts, and uncertain that diversity could ever take root in such arid soil, Ms. Nelson resigned in 1994 and is now president of the Leaders Forum, a nonprofit group in Milwaukee that promotes African-American business interests.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, I don't know how to begin to change the G.E. culture,'' she said. ''All we were saying was, 'Let's level the playing field.' Now, do we really want to say, 'We have to change the game altogether?' ''</p>
        <p>THE company's efforts to promote women and minorities began in the early 1970's, when civil-rights victories were bearing fruit in many American workplaces. A women's advisory panel was convened at the company, affirmative-action guidelines were issued, and Mr. Welch's predecessor, Reginald H. Jones, traveled to Washington to become chairman of the National Advisory Council on Minorities in Engineering.</p>
        <p>In the early 1970's, the General Electric Foundation went so far as to commission a one-act play to raise management consciousness. In the play, a male executive refuses to promote a secretary, then has a nightmare in which he is endlessly patronized by women. He wakes up screaming, ''I'm not a statistic!'' and, as the curtain falls, promises to stop blocking women's careers.</p>
        <p>The early initiatives put more women into jobs as welders and foremen, and even attracted some minority managers, like Mr. Trotter, who joined in 1970. But they did little to change demographics at the top.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Welch became chief executive in 1981, some people saw reason for optimism. True, Mr. Welch had come out of G.E.'s plastics business, a division known for its free-wheeling frat-house culture, and he began selling G.E. businesses, laying off tens of thousands of workers and instilling a harsh, Darwinian ethos through the company. But by eliminating whole layers of middle management that had been predominantly white and male, Mr. Welch raised hope in some circles that he was clearing the way for diverse up-and-comers.</p>
        <p>In 1992, an article in Working Woman magazine contended that the ''Welch management revolution'' bore a striking resemblance to then-current feminist management theories: Mr. Welch was trying to flatten hierarchies, encourage teamwork and have managers pool information across rigid turf lines, the article said, just as feminist scholars were declaring women to be quicker to share information, cooperate and encourage teamwork on the job.</p>
        <p>IT was that atmosphere that convinced Anne Poirson, a computer scientist, to go to work for G.E. as a systems designer in the early Welch years.</p>
        <p>''I researched different corporations around the country, and found out that G.E. was supposed to be one of the best for women,'' she recalled. ''There was equal pay, promotional opportunities.'' And Ms. Poirson also approved, in theory, of Mr. Welch's campaign to reshape and ''de-layer'' G.E.</p>
        <p>But in practice, Ms. Poirson found herself thrown in with a lot of frightened, white, male middle managers who believed that they were fighting for their survival -- and that she was the enemy.</p>
        <p>''A lot of managers told me they were intimidated by me,'' she said. ''I was a young woman in charge of some big projects, and I had a lot of clout. I was bringing in computer systems that were upsetting the power structure of the whole company. At one point, my productivity was rated on how many jobs I eliminated.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Poirson said she soon found herself excluded from key meetings and denied the secretarial help that she wanted. One day, she said, her boss told her point-blank, ''I'm making twice as much as you are, and someone is going to figure out that there should be two of you, and then they won't need me any more.''</p>
        <p>The entrenched layers of middle managers were being thinned, all right, but Ms. Poirson stopped hoping that women would rise in that environment. The whole point of restructuring was to strip away bureaucracy and improve earnings, she said, but because there were fewer management positions to go around, those who survived faced multiple workloads.</p>
        <p>Ms. Poirson resigned in 1986, after five years with the company, to go into business for herself. Today, at 52, she has her own software consulting firm and says she has more control over her career.</p>
        <p>''Someone in my position is not going to stick around at G.E. and wait for equality to simmer through the corporation,'' she said. ''Yes, it's a very good company, but in my particular case, I didn't think it was going to pay off for me.''</p>
        <p>Cheryl Watkins Snead, an engineer, told a similar story. One of the first black women to receive an engineering degree from the University of Massachusetts -- Mr. Welch's alma mater -- she said G.E. appeared eager to recruit female engineers. She joined the company in 1981 and moved quickly though a series of assignments in the United States, the Caribbean and Asia.</p>
        <p>But eventually, Ms. Snead said, she found herself wondering: Did all the transfers really mean that she was moving up?</p>
        <p>''Not just at G.E., but in corporate America, there are only so many management slots,'' she said. ''It gets to the point where your moves are lateral, not vertical.''</p>
        <p>Had more women been near the top of the corporate flow chart, Ms. Snead said, she might have felt more confident that her labors would pay off one day. But the two minority women on G.E.'s board today -- Andrea Jung, an Asian-American who is president and chief executive of Avon Products, and Ann M. Fudge, the African-American who is executive vice president of Kraft Foods -- arrived in 1998 and 1999, after Ms. Snead had resigned and founded Banneker Industries, an outsourcing firm.</p>
        <p>TO be sure, no one at G.E. ever contended that a main goal of restructuring was to advance women and minorities.</p>
        <p>''For us, the 80's were about getting our business model right, 'de-layering' and creating a 'boundaryless culture,' '' said Mr. Welch, using G.E. language for lopping off tiers of the corporate organization chart and encouraging employees to go directly to senior managers for information rather than inching up the chain of command.</p>
        <p>But years later, it was clear that the focus on earnings and market share had left diversity an orphan. G.E.'s leaders realized that they would have to address what they called the company's ''social architecture'' if they wanted to stop losing people like Ms. Poirson and Ms. Snead. They decided to apply ''work out'' -- a group-analysis process used to solve business problems in the 1980's -- to diversity. About 60 well-placed executives were called to the corporate headquarters in Fairfield, Conn. in early 1991.</p>
        <p>Among them were 15 African-Americans, who decided to sit down privately beforehand to sharpen their presentations. Mr. Trotter said he had a revelation as he walked in.</p>
        <p>''I had been around the company for 18 years, and I only knew 3 of the 15 people in the room,'' he said. One of diversity's most powerful advocates at G.E., he suddenly realized he could not possibly promote talented blacks if he did not know who they were. ''It was a mirror test,'' he said. ''I looked at myself and said, 'Am I using all of the necessary energy and the skill moving people up the ladder?' And the answer was, 'No.' ''</p>
        <p>Steven D. Thorne, then a G.E. human resources manager, said it was not just that G.E.'s black executives were too busy working to seek out one another. In general, African-Americans at G.E. were reluctant to call attention to themselves, he said, because the company's culture promoted colorblindness. If you were supposed to rise or fall on the basis of performance, what good would it do to bring up race?</p>
        <p>''It was a way of avoiding making waves,'' said Mr. Thorne, who became the corporation's top diversity officer last year. ''You put yourself at risk if you set yourself out.''</p>
        <p>At that first meeting, however, those 15 black managers began to think that if minority recruits at G.E. kept playing the corporate game by the colorblind rules, they would never even know who their teammates were, much less score. Certainly, they began to think, there was some way of bringing African-Americans together and promoting their interests without challenging the meritocracy itself and creating a backlash.</p>
        <p>When they raised the idea with Mr. Welch, he asked them what they had in mind. They had no answer.</p>
        <p>''We went back and said to each other, 'If he ever asks us that again, we don't want to be in that position,' '' Mr. Thorne said.</p>
        <p>For the next year, on their own time, black managers studied glass-ceiling issues and minority retention at other corporations, trying to learn what practices brought lasting gains, and which of those might work in G.E.'s culture. They also polled other black managers at the company., asking what they thought might be useful. They moved cautiously, Mr. Thorne said, fearing that if they threw together an ill-conceived program that failed, they would not receive a second chance.</p>
        <p>In the end, they settled on an in-house self-help network, called the African-American Forum. Started in 1992, its mandate is narrow: to demystify G.E.'s personnel policies, to provide a setting where G.E. blacks can meet one another and to develop a formal mentor program, in which G.E.'s senior executives are required to participate. G.E. says it is keeping track of which mentors' trainees receive promotions and is rating the mentors accordingly.</p>
        <p>OUTSIDE critics may find this disappointingly tame, but the G.E. planners chose to avoid any hint of advocacy, special status or quotas. They figured that a narrow focus on self-improvement, well within the confines of G.E.'s existing culture, would draw more members -- and that a large group with limited goals would accomplish more over time than a small group that tried too much.</p>
        <p>David A. Thomas, a Harvard Business School professor of organizational behavior who has studied diversity initiatives in large companies, agreed with that thinking. Corporate minority networks that succeed, he said, tend to have goals that jibe with the company's philosophy and can point to the participation of  top executives.</p>
        <p>The most recent gathering of the African-American Forum, in July, attracted 1,800 participants, including Mr. Welch and most of G.E.'s other senior executives based in the United States. Participants say the meetings provide something simple but important: a place where they can meet top executives without the usual pressure of being outnumbered by whites.</p>
        <p>''In my first year and a half, I knew every corporate officer,'' said A. Louis Parker, president of direct products for GE Financial Assurance, who came to G.E. in 1996 after stints at I.B.M., Automatic Data Processing and Morgan Stanley. ''It was very different from where I had been before. I've heard about diversity at other places, but G.E. is the first place I've felt it.''</p>
        <p>As the African American Forum began receiving plaudits like that, other groups at G.E. took note. Managerial women started planning their own self-help network in 1997, researching possible structures for a year and deciding that they, too, would restrict their mandate to narrow, nonconfrontational goals.</p>
        <p>There were no calls to celebrate women's ''web thinking'' or other supposed feminine advantages now being promoted in some theorist circles. In interviews, many G.E. women said they enjoyed the intense, no-holds-barred environment at G.E. and wanted their group, called the Women's Network, to help them better compete on those terms.</p>
        <p>Nor did the network's founders put work-family issues on their agenda. Though much research shows that these issues affect corporate women more than men, the G.E. women said they believed that the problems required individual solutions and that they did not want to lobby for one-size-fits-all remedies.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Women's Network has focused since 1998 on coaching women in public speaking, in making effective presentations and in exuding leadership qualities. It also links participants with senior-executive mentors. G.E., meanwhile, has asked Catalyst to conduct follow-up interviews with high-level women who leave the company, to make sure that there were no hidden gender issues driving them away.</p>
        <p>NONE of this will catapult any women or blacks -- or the Asians and Latinos now organizing their own groups -- past those white men at the front of the pack in time to claim Mr. Welch's job. But the many consultants who study G.E. and try to graft its practices onto other corporations are watching the latest efforts to see what they accomplish.</p>
        <p>''I think that by some of the programs that Jack Welch is pushing, he's kind of admitting that we have to do some special things'' to accelerate diversity, said Noel M. Tichy, a  professor of organizational behavior at the University of Michigan who ran G.E.'s management training center from 1985 to 1987 and now  writes and consults extensively on its management practices. ''That doesn't mean you don't have standards, and you're not going to be a meritocracy. I would put them as one of the companies that's pretty seriously driving this agenda. I don't know why it took them so long.''</p>
