        <p>NOTHING quite grabs your attention like a giraffe poking his head in your car window and uncoiling his 17-inch-long black tongue in search of tasty tree bark. Or an eight-foot-tall, 300-pound ostrich pecking at that same window (now rolled up).</p>
        <p>The animals at the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, a game park and conservation preserve 70 miles southwest of Dallas, definitely are not shy. And that's why my two daughters, ages 3 and 4, were shrieking with delight from the comfort of our rental car for more than two hours on a trip this spring to central Texas. Most of the 1,100 creatures at Fossil Rim roam free on 1,500 acres of central Texas hill country savanna and juniper-oak woodlands. Visitors stay in their cars for this safari, meandering along a winding 9.5-mile paved road through pastures, low trees and scrub, gazing at herds of wildebeest and gazelle.</p>

        <p>The animals at the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center, a game park and conservation preserve 70 miles southwest of Dallas, definitely are not shy. And that's why my two daughters, ages 3 and 4, were shrieking with delight from the comfort of our rental car for more than two hours on a trip this spring to central Texas. Most of the 1,100 creatures at Fossil Rim roam free on 1,500 acres of central Texas hill country savanna and juniper-oak woodlands. Visitors stay in their cars for this safari, meandering along a winding 9.5-mile paved road through pastures, low trees and scrub, gazing at herds of wildebeest and gazelle.</p>
        <p>The few carnivores at Fossil Rim, such as the cheetahs, are kept in enclosed areas, as are the rhinoceroses, for their own safety and ours. Otherwise, the preserve is heavy on hooved and horned beasts. Many of the animals seem tame, but the center's rules require visitors to remain in their vehicles. (''Drive yourself wild; however, please do it safely!'' our car pass admonished.)</p>
        <p>At the visitor center, the sales clerk recommended the guided tour on audiocassette. The fact-filled cassette is well worth the small, refundable deposit. My wife, Felice, and I took our girls on a weekday in late April, and the park was not overly crowded. There was plenty of room to pull off to the side of the road and watch the animals, and we went at our own pace. (The posted speed limit of 16 miles an hour was set in hopes it was odd enough to catch drivers' attention.)</p>
        <p>The visitors center sells cups of food pellets for $2.50 (limit one cup per car) that you can drop out your window as you drive along.</p>
        <p>Twenty-five years ago, Fossil Rim was a wild game ranch run by a Fort Worth oilman. The ranch was sold in 1987 to two entrepreneurs, Christine Jurzykowski and Jim Jackson. The park's name comes from the large number of fossil beds in the surrounding area, which was a seacoast 100 million years ago.</p>
        <p>The new owners set out to create a safe haven for some of the world's most threatened species, and established an animal conservation and education center for visitors. Earth Promise, a small foundation, began leasing the center last May. The center's directors include John Lukas, president of the International Rhino Foundation, and Jane Packard, a wildlife expert at Texas A &amp; M University.</p>
        <p>In addition to dealing with the public and conducting tours (besides the audiocassette tour, there's a behind-the-scenes one with a staff naturalist for $24), the center conducts research on the reproductive biology of black and white rhinos, and the behavior of ocelots, large endangered spotted cats. Last year, about 120,000 people visited the park.</p>
        <p>I have never been on an African safari, but Fossil Rim seemed a fine substitute for a car-bound family on a budget. From the moment we drove through the front gate, exotic critters abounded. Small herds of addaxes, heavily built white antelopes with twisting horns, and greater kudus, larger, majestic antelopes marked by vertical white stripes and long spiraling horns, grazed just a few feet from the road.</p>
        <p>At one point, some of the addaxes trotted over to us, no doubt looking for their customary handout. ''Don't run over him!'' cried 3-year-old Alexa when one of the antelopes sidled in front of our car.</p>
        <p>''Daddy, look, a little one!'' said Talia, 4, pointing excitedly to a baby addax with its mother.</p>
        <p>Halfway through the park, after passing assorted European red deer, Barbary sheep and a few Texas locals such as wild turkeys that mingle with the exotica, we stopped for lunch at the center's picnic area overlooking rolling hills and valleys.</p>
        <p>We had packed a lunch, but there was a nice cafe and nature store for snacks. After our sandwiches, we wandered over to the center's petting pasture, where the kids could cuddle with more familiar fauna, like goats and sheep.</p>
        <p>Back in the car, we stopped to watch zebras who seemed more intent on nibbling at the black rubber stripping around our windows than any morsels we had to offer. Just then, as I was peering out, the giraffes shuffled up, and one stuck his head in our window -- definitely too close for comfort.</p>
        <p>Where the antelope play</p>
        <p>The Fossil Rim Wildlife Center is 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth on Route 67, three miles west of Glen Rose; (254) 897-2960, or on the Web at www.fossilrim.org. The center is open daily except Thanksgiving and Christmas from 9 a.m. to two hours before sunset.</p>
        <p>Admission for the wildlife drive is $14.95, $11.95 ages 62 and older, and $9.95 ages 4 to 11; free for children under 4. A two-hour tour of the game preserve with a staff naturalist, which takes guests into areas off-limits to other visitors, costs $27, $20 for ages 4 to 11. Mountain bike tours of the park are available, by reservation only, for $30 a person.</p>
        <p>Overnight accommodations are available at a five-room lodge ($125 to $225 double occupancy per room, breakfast included) or in safari-style luxury tents. Each tent has two twin beds, private bathroom and heat and air-conditioning. The rate is $150 a tent, breakfast included.</p>
