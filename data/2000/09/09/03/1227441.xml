        <p>THE brass-bound Louis Vuitton steamer trunk appeared to have the same dimensions as the ice cream freezer at my local Korean grocery -- and no well-outfitted turn-of-the-century traveler would have stepped on board ship without one of these behemoths.

        <p>At an exhibition of antique travel accessories at the RISD Museum at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, I realized that I would never have cut much of a swath as a 19th-century traveler.

For a three-day trip to Rhode Island in August, I had only a change of clothes, an extra pair of shoes and a map, all shoved into an old grease-stained blue daypack.

        <p>THE brass-bound Louis Vuitton steamer trunk appeared to have the same dimensions as the ice cream freezer at my local Korean grocery -- and no well-outfitted turn-of-the-century traveler would have stepped on board ship without one of these behemoths. Or set foot out the door without her personal whiskey shot glass, cushioned from the bumps of the road by a fitted red leather case.</p>
        <p>At an exhibition of antique travel accessories at the RISD Museum at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, I realized that I would never have cut much of a swath as a 19th-century traveler. Compared with the classy outfittings on display, my baggage was like the branch and knotted kerchief of the runaway child. For a three-day trip to Rhode Island in August, I had only a change of clothes, an extra pair of shoes and a map, all shoved into an old grease-stained blue daypack. My most impressive piece of gear -- when I strap it on I feel like Robert Capa heading out into the battlefield -- was a padded waist pack that held my camera and lenses.</p>
        <p>Normally my luggage isn't so spartan. But on this little adventure I wanted  maximum freedom and maximum mobility. I was planning to go by bicycle along the East Bay Bicycle Path from Providence to Bristol, R.I. The trip isn't long, only  about 14 1/2 miles in each direction, most of them along the Narragansett Bay. Still, I had to edit down my belongings to the essentials -- everything had to fit onto my body, and leave me balanced enough to enjoy the ride.</p>
        <p>The East Bay Bike Path is one of about a thousand such bike paths across the country that have been converted from old railway beds as part of the ''rails to trails'' program. Flat, paved and restricted to bikers, Roller bladers and pedestrians, the East Bay suited all my requirements for bike nirvana -- no cars, great scenery and no hills. I liked the idea of a car-free summer escape. Cutting the car rental expense out of any vacation can save up to a third of the cost. Since ''budget'' accommodation in New England in summer peak season means rates in the high double digits, the money saved on a car rental can help offset the higher lodging prices.</p>
        <p>In New York City, the car-free life is no problem -- I, for instance, have never owned one. But outside the city, arranging a car-free trip can be challenging. Getting from New York to Providence is easy -- Amtrak has regular daily service between the two cities. I booked an off-peak round trip for $87 -- receiving the 10 percent discount available to all AAA members.</p>
        <p>With the train journey organized, I investigated bike rentals, and found East Providence Cycle, a company that rents mountain bikes for $25 a day, including lock and helmet. The man at the shop told me it had a branch right on the East Bay Bike Path, and I arranged to pick up a bike there the day after I arrived.</p>
        <p>Providence, once a fading New England industrial city, has recently, and rather famously, redeveloped its center city into a tourist attraction. Engineers redirected the flow of the Woonasquatucket River, adding plazas, walkways and bridges. The Amtrak station is a short walk from the new Waterside Plaza. But I was arriving in midafternoon  and didn't want to miss visiting the RISD (pronounced RIZ-dee) Museum, which closes at 5. So I didn't linger -- I grabbed a taxi ($5) to the Annie Brownell House, the bed-and-breakfast where I'd reserved a room for $85.</p>
        <p>A big old restored Colonial Revival  house in a neighborhood of similarly grand houses, the Annie Brownell is about three long blocks east of Brown University. Ten minutes of pleasant walking under leafy maples took me to Thayer Street, the  main student drag of coffee shops, cheap Mexican restaurants and bookstores, and another 15 minutes to the RISD Museum. The exhibition of travel paraphernalia  wasn't the only happy surprise. As I entered, the clerk at the ticket desk offered  to return my $5 admission fee if I filled  out a little one-page survey, making my museum visit free.</p>
        <p>The museum has a strong collection of Asian artifacts, from a beautiful exhibition of Southeast Asian textiles to a 10-foot wooden Buddha from the Koya-san monastery in Japan. The items, most donated by rich globe-trotting Providence patrons, serve as a reminder that this area of Rhode Island made much of its early wealth from the shipping trade with the Far East.</p>
        <p>Brown University graduates -- at least the ones I know -- are passionate about the charms of their old college town. Since I knew I had only one night in Providence for dinner, I asked an alumna friend what was the most special place to eat in town. Without hesitation, she said, ''Al Forno.''</p>
        <p>And indeed, Al Forno (about a 10-minute walk from the museum) was superb, from the first little appetizer of handmade, baked fish cakes, to the delicious main course of spaghetti in an unusual sauce of zucchini and parmesan shavings. I took a chance on a glass of white wine from a Rhode Island vineyard (Sakonnet), and was delighted by the fresh taste, neither too sweet nor too dry. Al Forno wasn't cheap (the three courses cost about $50), but this would be my only fancy dinner of the vacation, so I was happy to have it perfect, at (almost) any price.</p>
        <p>The next morning, after a quick breakfast (included in the B &amp; B rate), I slung on my gear and set out to find the beginning of the East Bay Bike Path. Getting from my lodgings to the bike rental place was the only part of my trip that I hadn't worked out in advance. The fellow at East Providence Bike Rental had told me over the phone that it was a few miles south of the beginning of the bike path. I figured I'd walk. But when I got to India Point Park in Providence, I couldn't find the bike path at all.</p>
        <p>Confused, I asked directions of an elderly man walking a fluffy white dog, and he informed me that the rental place was quite a distance away, in the Providence suburb of Riverside. He offered to drive me there, and I said yes.</p>
        <p>Thanks to his kindness, I was spared a walk of over five miles -- the place was about a third of the way down the path. Irritated that I wouldn't be able to ride the entire length of the path, I mentioned it to the clerk as he was adjusting my mountain bike. He said that if I called on the way back, I could drop the bike off at the company's shop in town (inexplicably, they will accept returns in Providence, but will rent only from the shop on the trail.)</p>
        <p>The annoyance of getting the bike evaporated once I sped out onto the trail, a cool breeze in my face. Because it was a weekday, and threatening rain, I had the path almost to myself. I wound through woods, under canopies of maple trees, alongside large, quiet ponds thick with pelicans and gulls. The air smelled powerfully of brine. The Rhode Island coast, where forested salt ponds meet the cool blue bay, is bracing and exhilarating in summer, and even more so from the seat of a fast-moving bicycle. The ride, even with the gear on my back, proved easy -- in about 45 minutes I passed through the town of Warren, and about a mile later the path came out to a crossroads. I could continue straight to Bristol or take a detour to the right, to the Colt State Park and the Bristol Town Beach.</p>
        <p>I detoured. The beach scene was straight out of Norman Rockwell: a small strip of sand, two weather-beaten wooden lifeguard stations, and teenaged girls in bikinis preening for teenaged boys. I rode on through the park for a few miles more, following a road that led alongside the sea and around a horseshoe bay, eventually hooking up again with the bike path. Another 10 minutes put me at the door of the Parker Borden House bed-and-breakfast in Bristol where I'd booked a room for $90 a night.</p>
        <p>''You made it,'' Jean Tischer, who owns the place with her husband, Bob, said with a smile. ''I've made a space in the garage where you can put your bike.''</p>
        <p>I'D visited Bristol 25 years earlier, and remembered it as a quaint, sea-swept New England town with rough edges -- sailors, factories, working class immigrants. Now it's begun to catch the tourism overflow from Newport, 20 miles to the south -- the old brick factories are being converted into condos, and there's a handful of bed-and-breakfasts like the Parker Borden -- but I felt as if I'd landed in a real place, not a cute shopping mall.</p>
        <p>I was the only guest in the cheery red Federal house that dated from 1798. After showering and changing in my room -- it was a large corner room with a queen bed and four windows -- I hopped back on my bike to explore the town.</p>
        <p>American flags and red-white-and-blue banners hung from every other pastel Federal and Victorian house on Hope Street, the main drag in Bristol. Its Fourth of July celebration is the oldest and most famous in Rhode Island, and the decorations aren't taken down till summer's end (and the highway stripe remains tricolor year round). I liked that, and I also liked the fact that riding up several blocks from Hope, the picture-perfect houses turned clapboard and working-class, with Portuguese and Italian pizza parlors appearing on the corners.</p>
        <p>Dinner that night wasn't hard to figure out -- a pie with everything from Sam's Restaurant and Pizzeria was about $10.</p>
        <p>I had ambitious plans for the next day that involved taking the bike 18 miles south to Sakonnet Vineyards, the source of the surprisingly good wine at Al Forno. But life on the bike path had spoiled me for riding in the fast lane, with cars. Crossing the Mount Hope Bridge, I had to drink in the beautiful vistas of the Narragansett with an exhaust fume chaser. At the Sakonnet bridge, a sign said ''Closed to Pedestrians and Bicycles.'' I bailed out and returned to Bristol, consoling myself with lunch on the outdoor porch at the Lobster Pot, where a swordfish sandwich, a beer and a view of the bay cost $11.</p>
        <p>Over breakfast that morning -- Mrs. Tischer made delicious corn pancakes -- Bob Tischer had wondered why I wanted to ride away from Bristol, since there were so many things to see in town. Several of its grand mansions had been turned into museums, including Blithewold, an immense English-style estate, where I spent an hour or so roaming through lovely gardens straight out of Jane Austen.</p>
        <p>From Blithewold I moved on to Linden Place, an imposing mansion on Hope Street built in 1810 by Gen. George DeWolf, a Bristol entrepreneur who, like many other rich sea captains in town, was making a fortune from plantations, the slave trade and West Indian piracy. As the well-informed tour guide told captivating tales of the DeWolf family saga, I was struck, as I had been in the museum, by the intricate connections between this small corner of Rhode Island and distant places across the sea.</p>
        <p>Images of sailors and ships and far-off lands remained on my mind as I rode back to Providence the next morning, stopping to admire the view of the city from the bike path before turning off and climbing a hill into East Providence, toward the bike shop's main branch.</p>
        <p>Another far-off land came to mind as, bikeless, I headed back to the Amtrak station in a taxi. ''My cousin's pizza place in Federal Hill is pretty good,'' said the Italian driver. I looked at my watch -- there was just enough time. I told the driver to forget the train station and drop me off at Caserta's Pizzeria.</p>
        <p>Twenty minutes later I hopped onto a city bus carrying a daypack on my back, a camera on my belt, and a medium pizza with the works in a flat white box.</p>
        <p>With minutes to spare, I boarded my train for home, equipped with the essentials.</p>
        <p>Easy riding along Narragansett Bay</p>
        <p>I spent $136.92 on lodging, food, local transport and activities over three days and nights in Rhode Island.</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>I bought a round-trip coach ticket on Amtrak from Penn Station in New York to Providence, R.I., for $87, a price that reflects a 10 percent AAA discount.</p>
        <p>I rented a mountain bike, helmet and lock for $25 a day from East Providence Cycle, with branches at 111 Crescent View Avenue, Riverside, R.I., (401) 437-2453, and 414 Warren Avenue, East Providence, (800) 235-2453. And although I kept the bike for two and a half days, my total charge came to $53.50 with tax. East Providence Cycle will let you drop off a bike in East Providence (a $6 taxi ride from downtown), but will rent only from the Riverside shop, which is 5.5 miles south of the beginning of the 14.5-mile East Bay Bicycle Path. I lucked into a ride there, but there are also buses from Providence to Riverside: (401) 781-9400 for information.</p>
        <p>The East Bay Bike Path is a beautiful car-free path open to bicyclists, pedestrians, Rollerbladers and skateboarders. Since it was converted from an old railroad bed, it is straight and fairly flat, making for easy riding. Use of the bike path is free, as is a map of the East Bay and several other Rhode Island bike paths available from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. It can be ordered through the Web at www.rhodeisland.com.</p>
        <p>Lodging</p>
        <p>Plan well in advance for summer New England trips. Even though I was booking three weeks ahead for midweek stays, I still had difficulty finding rooms in Providence and Bristol. I found my bed-and-breakfasts from the Web site maintained by the Rhode Island Visitor's Bureau (www.visitrhodeisland.com). A 7 percent tax is added to all hotel bills in Rhode Island.</p>
        <p>The Annie Brownell House Bed and Breakfast, 400 Angel Street, (401) 454-2934, is a big, bright Colonial Revival house dating from 1899, not far from Brown University. It was a good value at $85 a night, and was refreshingly free of the froufrou usually found in ''Victorian'' B &amp; B's. My spacious room on the second floor was pleasantly decorated with antiques, had twin mahogony beds covered simply in white chenille, a private bath with shower stall but no tub, and windows overlooking a quiet yard. Breakfast was included in the rate.</p>
        <p>The best thing about the Parker Borden House, 736 Hope Street, (401) 253-2084, the 1798 Federal house where I stayed, is the warm welcome of Jean and Bob Tischer. The bad news is that the Tischers are selling the place soon, and will not take reservations for rooms past September. My room was a bit noisy because it faced busy Hope Street, a problem I corrected by running the air-conditioner at night. The rate was $90.</p>
        <p>Food</p>
        <p>On the Brown University graduates' grapevine, Al Forno, 570 South Main Street, (401) 273-9767, is more than an Italian restaurant in Providence -- it is a legend. The food lived up to the hype; there was not a misstep in my three-course meal of homemade baked fish cakes, pasta with zucchini sauce, and sheep's-milk cheese smothered in blackberry sauce with fresh figs. With a glass of Sakonnet Vineyard's Rhode Island fume blanc, my bill came to a pricey, but worth it, $56.45 including tip. No smoking; closed Sunday and Monday.</p>
        <p>Also a fixture of Providence's Italian cuisine is Caserta's Pizzeria, (401) 621-3618, 121 Spruce Street in Federal Hill, Providence's Little Italy. A small pie with four toppings and a beer cost $9. It's takeout, but it has Formica tables for eating in, too.</p>
        <p>The Lobster Pot, 119-121 Hope Street, (401) 253-9100, has been in Bristol since 1929. I had a swordfish sandwich platter and a beer on the back deck overlooking the bay, all for $11.</p>
        <p>If pressed, I would say that the pizza at Sam's Restaurant and Pizzeria in Bristol, 149 Bradford Street, (401) 253-7949, was slightly better than at Caserta. Again, the ambience is basic and informal -- Formica tables, paper place mats. My pie with chorizo and anchovy topping, and a beer, cost $10. (Sam's has been closed for renovation, and reopens Wednesday.)</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>The usual entry fee at the RISD Museum at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, 224 Benefit Street, (401) 454-6500, is $5; however I was given a free entry when I agreed to fill out a questionnaire.</p>
        <p>Bristol now has nine museums, and they have banded together to offer a deal -- when you pay full admission to one (usually $5), you receive a discount of $1 on admission to each of the others.</p>
        <p>I visited two: Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum, Ferry Road, (401) 253-2707, and Linden Place, 500 Hope Street, (401) 253-0390. Call ahead for opening times and hours.</p>
