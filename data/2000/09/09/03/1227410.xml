        <p>The Prince</p>
        <p>Of Tennessee</p>
        <p>The Rise of Al Gore.</p>
        <p>By David Maraniss</p>
        <p>and Ellen Nakashima.</p>
        <p>323 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster. $23.</p>
        <p>Al Gore can balance quite large objects -- tennis rackets, umbrellas, coat hangers, that sort of thing -- on the end of his nose. This unlikely acrobatic skill, perfected when he was a St. Albans schoolboy, tends to find expression when the vice president is bored or keen to defuse a situation, but it is also an apt motif for a life spent juggling rival forces, internal, familial and political. In this fine, deep-mine biography, David Maraniss, an associate editor at The Washington Post, and Ellen Nakashima, a staff reporter there, depict Gore's personality as a remarkable balancing act: parental pressure pulling against personal inclination, the rural son of Tennessee at odds with the cosmopolitan princeling of the Fairfax Hotel, the dreamy idealist and the hard-punching political pro, self-doubt struggling with self-righteousness, ''competing characteristics of farsightedness and caution, selflessness and self-aggrandizement, that have defined him, for better and worse, during his political career.''</p>
        <p>Gore called his 1992 manifesto on environmentalism ''Earth in the Balance''; an alternative title for ''The Prince of Tennessee'' might be ''A Life in the Balance.'' The balance is not always comfortable, and the authors depict a character far more complex and conflicted than the man he would succeed in the White House. Where Maraniss's essential biography of Bill Clinton, ''First in His Class,'' was painted in great swaths of color, this is more a work of pointillism, myriad small dots of reportage brought together to form a vivid portrait.</p>
        <p>The shaping of the Gore biography started before his birth. ''If I have a baby boy, I don't want the news buried on an inside page,'' Albert Gore, the father-senator, told the Washington bureau of The Tennessean. ''I want it on Page 1, where it belongs.''</p>
        <p>Gore has spent his entire life on Page 1; he was raised to belong there. When he was 6 his parents were already planting media stories of his precocity, showcasing ''another Gore on the way toward the political pinnacle.'' Perhaps unsurprisingly, given these circumstances, at every critical stage in his life Gore seems to have been aware of an unseen but omnipresent biographer, hovering behind his shoulder, taking notes. ''I was a real little politician,'' he once said, somewhat sadly, of his own childhood. From the earliest years almost every strategic decision, in the authors' phrase, appears to have been underpinned by ''thinking politically on a longer arc.''</p>
        <p>So Gore went to Vietnam, to take part in a war of which he passionately disapproved, because it would make a bad impression and damage his father's already struggling senatorial campaign if he did not. He kept his distance from the tumult of antiwar protest at Harvard, ''taking into account not just his feelings at the moment, but also how his actions might affect the political futures of himself or his father.'' When his father made him work in the Tennessee tobacco fields, was that good farming or just good politics?</p>
        <p>There are other, less familiar but equally telling examples of Gore's compulsive self-scrutiny. In 1971, Gore was not attacked by a bear during a camping trip in Yosemite. The Gores had failed to heed warnings and left a half-eaten candy bar in their tent when they fell asleep. Sure enough, a brown bear came into the campsite, clawed the Gore tent and then wandered off again, having signally failed to change the course of history. To anyone else, this might be an opportunity for self-deprecating reminiscence, but not to Gore, who declined to tell the story when urged to, according to a friend, because ''he couldn't stand to look bad in front of a group of people.'' The environmentalist could not be seen to be ignorant on the subject of ursine eating habits.</p>
        <p>Someone who senses possible political danger in a half-eaten Snickers dating back three decades is not an easy character to pin down. It is perhaps this restraint, rather than his well-publicized self-inflations and midcampaign image adjustments, that explains why voters still feel they do not know Gore. How well can you know someone so adept at self-projection and protection, whose guard never seems to come down?</p>
        <p>Maraniss and Nakashima have come closer to the core Gore than any other biographers to date. They reveal a man of intensely competitive urges, impelled by a Calvinist fear of chaos, plagued by doubts, exceptionally competent and confident but uneasy in his own skin, indefatigable, loyal and loyalty-inspiring yet also somewhat lonely.</p>
        <p>There is a scientific literalness in the Gore mentality as described here, an absolute faith in the power of pure information that comes close to obsession. He may not have invented the Internet, but at times Gore speaks and behaves as if the Internet had invented him. ''Everything came down to facts -- more than parliamentary skill or emotion or personality or intuition or chemistry or poetry or even wealth, pre-eminent was the raw data that comprised information.'' There is little of that quality Keats admired, ''when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact.'' A highly trained political animal with an expansive mind and an instinct for the jugular, he yet appears quirkless in his adult life, lacking the edges that give form to character. Although people who know him well consistently vouch for Gore's black and understated sense of humor, there are no memorable examples in this book.</p>
        <p>Underneath this often unflattering picture, the authors have identified the contours of an earlier, more attractive portrait, now obscured by successive layers of political veneer: a romantic soul who likes to sing loudly and drive wildly, who profoundly believes there is a right way and wants to find it, a personality so charged and pent up that when he tells his uncertain wife, for the first time, that he is running for political office, he immediately hits the floor and begins doing push-ups. The very rawness of this internal drive inspires admiration, if not necessarily affection.</p>
        <p>''Always do right,'' Gore's father reportedly told his only son as he lay dying. If true, these are strange last words; not a release or a farewell, nor yet an expression of love, but a quotable injunction, another order. You can almost hear the invisible biographer scribbling away. Albert Gore Sr. looms over every page of ''The Prince of Tennessee,'' a white-haired Shakespearean patriarch demanding obedience and dedication, even in death; more insistently in death. The old man's astonishment and anger when his son's first presidential campaign was rocked by the issue of pot smoking is one of the most telling episodes in a deeply formal relationship, fraught with unspoken tension. Plainly it had never occurred to the father that his son could do something that might jeopardize the presidential plan.</p>
        <p>For sure, there was little enough devilry in the young scion. Indeed, so heavy is the weight of paternal expectation, of destiny foretold, that at times he almost seems to lack a will of his own, his own instincts obscured by the overriding commandment to ''do right.'' Thus we find his wife, Tipper, as Gore is debating whether to go to Vietnam, pleading with him: ''What do you really think and how are you going to feel if you do this?''</p>
        <p>''The Prince of Tennessee'' achieves what Gore himself has found so difficult on the stump, by rounding him out into a full character, neither the wooden bore depicted by his enemies nor the perfect prince that his father forged and he has always tried to be. Gore's sense of balance has made him a formidable politician: stable, agile, unflappable, a master of policy and a superb debater. But it may also have suppressed some of the humanity within. The prince born to be president was so busy looking ahead to the prize -- amassing all the facts, doing right, projecting the correct image, blending belief and calculation, trimming the message to the audience and circumstance -- that his sense of self somehow got buried. The famously stiff and distant campaigner is also the one who asks insistently: ''How'd I do? How'd I do?''</p>
        <p>The impression given here is of a man who knows almost everything about almost everything except his own personality. If Al Gore wants to get to know himself better, he would be well advised to read this book.</p>
