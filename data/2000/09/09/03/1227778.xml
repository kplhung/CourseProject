        <p>Unable to decide whether this year's or last year's General Assembly president should be in the chair for a summit meeting of member nations this week, United Nations members took the diplomatic way out. Both will preside.</p>
        <p>Namibia held the presidency of the 54th General Assembly, which ends with the special summit meeting session. Finland will be president of the 55th General Assembly. For the past year, Namibia has been represented in the Assembly president's chair by Theo-Ben Gurirab, the country's foreign minister. But for the special summit meeting, President Sam Nujoma will be here.</p>
        <p>He will share duties with President Tarja Halonen of Finland. Ms. Halonen, who was elected president of Finland in February, is a trade union lawyer and has been a member of Parliament since 1979. From 1995 until this year, she served as Finland's foreign minister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nujoma, the founder of the South West Africa People's Organization, led his country to independence from South Africa with the help of the United Nations in 1989, and became Namibia's first president in 1990.</p>
