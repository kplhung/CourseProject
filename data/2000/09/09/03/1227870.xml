        <p>Latest Gallup Poll shows Vice Pre Al Gore and Gov George W Bush virtually tied, 46 percent for Bush and 45 percent for Gore; shows that voters think that Gore is smarter and better looking, but say Bush is better speaker and has better sense of humor (S)/</p>

        <p>The latest presidential preference poll by Gallup, like most recent preference polls, has George W. Bush and Al Gore virtually tied, 46 percent for Mr. Bush and 45 percent for Mr. Gore. But this time Gallup had some other questions, too, and here's what voters really think:</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is smarter and better looking but Mr. Bush is a better speaker and has a better sense of humor.</p>
        <p>Although most men and women agreed that Mr. Gore was smarter, when it came to who was the better speaker, most men said Mr. Bush but women were closely divided between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore. Women also were closely divided over who had the better sense of humor, while most men stuck with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Roughly two of every three women said Mr. Gore was the most handsome. And men generally agreed, though two of every five insisted they had no opinion.</p>
        <p>Who would be the better dinner partner? Most men chose Mr. Bush while most women favored Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>What's it all mean, if anything?</p>
        <p>Frank Newport, Gallup's executive editor, noted that Mr. Gore has been working hard to change his wardrobe and his speaking style, while Mr. Bush has been forced to contend with the smartness issue. ''Voters certainly take into account these ephemeral, nonissue related measures,'' Mr. Newport said.</p>
        <p>The poll, covering 1,019 adults, was taken last weekend and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
