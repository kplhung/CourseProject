        <p>As I rode east on Sunrise Highway, today, I saw the band of chicory near the shoulder of the road, and it reminded me that John Updike had written that Foxy's eyes were as blue as chicory. I was soon looking at the other flowers. The yellow goldenrod was coming into full bloom. The thoroughwort was white in contrast. The grasses were reddish brown, and a reminder that there was a rush to flower, to set seed, and to complete the cycle that perpetuates life. I  found a charming and insignificant orchid among the showier, larger inflorescences. It was a late-summer bloomer, Spiranthes or ladies'-tresses. What a delight!</p>

        <p>As I retraced my route west later in the day, all the flowers were gone. Nothing remained but the short, mowed vegetation. Presumably in a nod to the legacy of Robert Moses who sought tidy lawns bordering winding parkways, the sharp mower blades had reduced what had been a wild, untamed flower garden into an uninteresting lawn.</p>
