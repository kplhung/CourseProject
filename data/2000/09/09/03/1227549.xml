        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Ellen Willis's article ''Steal This Myth: Why We Still Try to Re-Create the Rush of the 60's'' [Aug. 20] reminded me of what I consider the movie that really got closest to the heart of the 60's, Alain Tanner's ''Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000.'' I remembered being profoundly moved by that story of a group of young people who had fought at the barricades in 1968, longed so passionately for a radical change in society's structure, and found themselves in 1975 disillusioned and frustrated at feeling that it was all in vain.</p>

        <p>Ellen Willis's article ''Steal This Myth: Why We Still Try to Re-Create the Rush of the 60's'' [Aug. 20] reminded me of what I consider the movie that really got closest to the heart of the 60's, Alain Tanner's ''Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000.'' I remembered being profoundly moved by that story of a group of young people who had fought at the barricades in 1968, longed so passionately for a radical change in society's structure, and found themselves in 1975 disillusioned and frustrated at feeling that it was all in vain.</p>
        <p>I was inspired by Ms. Willis's article to rent the video this week, and again I felt totally emotionally involved in the longings of those eight people for, as Ms. Willis says, ''a wholly different way of being.'' Their fervent hopes were for a better world for the baby, to be named Jonah, who was to be born that year to one of the couples. If Alain Tanner were to bring back that group of idealists now, they would be flabbergasted at the materialism and the complete lack of any hope of change, and Jonah would probably be a millionaire at 25 at his second Internet start-up.</p>
