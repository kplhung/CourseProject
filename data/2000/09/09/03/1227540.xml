        <p>Turning 90 and Still Singing</p>
        <p>Kitty Carlisle Hart turns 90 today, and she will spend at least part of her birthday singing. ''I practice every day of my life,'' the actress and singer said in a recent interview. ''I'm frightfully lucky.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hart, who served as chairwoman of the New York State Council on the Arts from 1976 to 1996, discovered her musical calling as a girl in boarding school.

        <p>Turning 90 and Still Singing</p>
        <p>Kitty Carlisle Hart turns 90 today, and she will spend at least part of her birthday singing. ''I practice every day of my life,'' the actress and singer said in a recent interview. ''I'm frightfully lucky.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hart, who served as chairwoman of the New York State Council on the Arts from 1976 to 1996, discovered her musical calling as a girl in boarding school. She was rehearsing for a school production when ''all of a sudden I felt in my element,'' she said. ''This was what I was going to do. I never wavered.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hart sang at the Metropolitan Opera and played the ingenue in the Marx Brothers' classic ''A Night at the Opera.'' She also made films with Bing Crosby and was a regular on the television game shows ''To Tell the Truth'' and ''I've Got a Secret.''</p>
        <p>When she and her mother lost their money in the stock market crash of 1929, her mother took a practical approach. Mrs. Hart recalled: ''She said, 'You're not the prettiest girl in the world, you're not the best singer and you're not the best actress.  But we'll put them all together and find the husband we're looking for on the stage.' ''</p>
        <p>Years later, Mrs. Hart liked to say, ''I went into the theater to find a rich husband, and I did.''</p>
        <p>The rich husband, of course, was Moss Hart, the Pulitzer-Prize winning playwright and director, perhaps best known for his collaboration with the composer Richard Rodgers.</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Hart connected -- nine years after she had unsuccessfully auditioned for him -- at a dinner party given by the playwright Lillian Hellman. ''I said to him, 'Tell me about your trip to the South Pole,' '' Mrs. Hart said. ''He always loved my directness.''</p>
        <p>The couple married in 1946 and had two children, Cathy, who is a doctor, and Christopher, a producer and director. Mr. Hart died in 1961.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hart's future plans include an appearance in a revival of ''To Tell the Truth'' and a starring role in several birthday parties to be given in her honor. One will take place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, another will be private and a third will be held at the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase on Sept. 16. Roy R. Neuberger, the museum's founder, will serve as an honorary chairman of the event, which will benefit the AT&amp;T Westchester Arts Network.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hart sang a public ''Happy Birthday'' to Mr. Neuberger when he turned 95 two years ago, and the two are said to have a close relationship.</p>
        <p>All Mrs. Hart would say, however, was, ''He's a friend of mine.''</p>
        <p>A Waterfront Idea for Yonkers</p>
        <p>Welcome to the Yonkers Biodome, a temperature-controlled environment with trees, animals, waterfalls and a built-in carousel.  You haven't seen it?</p>
        <p>That's because right now the biodome exists only on the drawing board of the recent Youth Summit, which met at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers. Teenage docents from 10 museums in Massachusetts, Connecticut and upstate New York joined with junior docents at the museum to brainstorm about issues in their communities. The event was sponsored by the museum's junior docents.</p>
        <p>As a warm-up, the 45 participants tackled Yonkers: how should the city use two parcels of land near the waterfront -- specifically, the parking lot and the fishing area near the Metro-North train station?</p>
        <p>Their suggestions, which had the ear of Yonkers' architects and city planners, combined whimsy with foresight: a building called the River Front, complete with recreation center, a waterfront restaurant and an arcade; a multiplex-sports center, where theatergoers can also play mini-golf; a farmers' market built along a promenade, flanked by two-bedroom apartments with a view of the Palisades; and open space to be used for concerts, picnics and ''just to play  ball.''</p>
        <p>During their four-day conference, the youngsters also got job-interview tips from Youth Theater Interactions of Yonkers, saw a planetarium show and took a Hudson River boat ride. Before returning home to become problem-solvers on their own turf, they also toured their host museum and visited the Whitney Museum of American Art in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Purchase Stresses Liberal Arts</p>
        <p>Purchase College is forging a new direction. Long viewed as the premiere performing arts campus of the State University system, the school is now emphasizing its liberal arts and science programs.</p>
        <p>''The conservatories are limited because of their structure -- they recruit only a small number of high-caliber students,''  said Geraldine Sanderson, director of public affairs, referring to the dance, music, film and theater conservatories. ''The growth  will be in liberal arts and science.''</p>
        <p>Of the 1,123 new students, 65 percent are enrolled in liberal arts and science, compared with 58 percent last year, while 35 percent are enrolled in the visual and performing arts, compared with 42 percent last year.</p>
        <p>Another trend is to recruit commuters, Ms. Sanderson said. Until a new dormitory is completed next year, there is little room on campus.</p>

        <p>Correction:  September 10, 2000, Sunday  A brief report in the Footlights column last Sunday about Kitty Carlisle Hart referred incorrectly to the collaborators of her husband, the playwright Moss Hart. They were George S. Kaufman and Irving Berlin. (The Hart who worked with the composer Richard Rodgers was Lorenz.)</p>
