        <p>What weighs 1.4 tons, lives in Yorktown Heights and is as popular as Larry King and Carmen Electra? Hint: It defeated Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997.</p>
        <p>Deep Blue, the chess-playing computer created by I.B.M., has worked its way onto the celebrity radar screen, according to a study by Marketing Evaluations/ TvQ, a Long Island company that measures celebrity appeal. It showed that 50 percent of 1,200 adults polled across the country recognized Deep Blue.</p>
        <p>The company formulates Q scores to measure celebrity. Deep Blue got a 9 rating, the same as Carmen Electra. Larry King's is 7 and Donald Trump is 11. Mickey Mouse is a 44.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. officials say that Deep Blue has received more than 5,000 mentions in the print media over the last three years. It is currently retired from chess, and now doing analyses in retail, Internet and stock prices.</p>
