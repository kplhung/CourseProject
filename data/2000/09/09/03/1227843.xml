        <p>I keep hearing how movie theaters are sprucing up their menus to try to satisfy pickier palates, but how come I never wander into those places? I'm usually packing a horse-like hunger when I go to the movies, foolishly postponing dinner for a dose of unreality. More often than not, the concessions counter is packed with the same provender I've ogled since I wore Buster Browns. Only these days the teenagers behind the counter offer not to butter my popcorn, but to douse it with ''butter-flavored'' goo. No thanks. Salvation, at least in Tenafly, lies in a closet-sized shop next door to Clearview Cinemas. At Cactus Sushi and Fresh Juice, the interior is spotless, spare, inviting. My first time here, I ordered an eight-piece sushi box with a California and Tekka maki roll ($8.50), and braced myself. How good can fast-food sushi be? At Cactus, it's delicious. The food is fresh, the chef engaging, the wait, well, typical. Everything is made to order, as it should be, and you should build time into your foray if you plan to eat first (bistro tables await you on the sidewalk) and catch a movie. There are sushi rolls, veggie rolls, and dozen or so specialty rolls. Cactus also sells about 20 fresh-squeezed juices, fruit shakes and smoothies. At Cactus, you eat abundantly and well without feeling fleeced. And there's not an drop of faux butter in sight.</p>
