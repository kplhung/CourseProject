        <p>AS the soldiers raped and beat her in front of her two children, a Bosnian refugee recalled, they taunted her, saying there was nowhere she could turn for help.</p>
        <p>They were wrong.</p>
        <p>Last month, a jury in a Manhattan federal court awarded the woman and a group of other refugees from the Balkans war $745 million in their case against the former leader of Serbian forces in Bosnia, Radovan Karadzic, charging him with masterminding a campaign of genocide, rape and torture in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>That is just one of a series of recent cases in which American courts have agreed to hear civil cases involving human rights violations outside American territory.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Center for Constitutional Rights -- a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that successfully argued the first such case more than 20 years ago -- served papers on Li Peng, the former Chinese premier, who was staying at the Waldorf Towers in Manhattan. Jennifer M. Green, a lawyer with the center who is arguing the case, said a group of Chinese students has filed suit in federal court in Manhattan against Mr. Li over the Chinese government's actions during the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.</p>
        <p>''I think the U.S. courts' acceptance of human rights standards are important steps forward in an international system in which human rights violators can be held accountable,'' Ms. Green said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return calls requesting comment last week.</p>
        <p>In 1978, the Center for Constitutional Rights sued a government official in Paraguay on behalf of a family who claimed their son had been tortured there. The case, Filartiga v. Pena, was a landmark attempt to use American courts to judge a dispute that, on its face, had nothing to do with the United States or its citizens. To make the argument, Peter Weiss, the center's vice president, turned to a 1787 law called the Alien Tort Claims Act, which allowed foreigners to use American courts to sue for violations of international law.</p>
        <p>Congress passed the law after an attack on a French diplomat in Philadelphia, said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a professor of international law at Harvard who collaborated on a recent article about the law for the journal Foreign Affairs.</p>
        <p>''It was what was called a badge of honor,'' Ms. Slaughter said. ''We wanted to proclaim we were a member of the family of nations.''</p>
        <p>At that time, international law consisted of conventions between sovereign states, and covered issues like piracy and diplomatic immunity.</p>
        <p>Bert Neuborne, a New York University law professor, views the Nuremberg Tribunals that followed World War II as a turning  point for international law, because the Nuremburg judges found that even though the Nazis had acted within their own legal framework, they were not immune from prosecution under a more general law.</p>
        <p>''International law involves individuals and not just governments,'' Mr. Neuborne said. ''Human rights norms trump the rights of dictators.''</p>
        <p>That attitude underlies some international criminal cases, like Spain's pursuit of the former Argentine strongman Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and the indictments issued by the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague.</p>
        <p>And since the Filartiga case ended in 1980 -- with a judgment of more than $10 million for the plaintiffs -- there has been a steady increase in the number of civil cases brought in American courts by foreign plaintiffs against foreign defendants, Ms. Slaughter said.</p>
        <p>Application of the Alien Tort Claims Act, and a handful of similar laws, has extended beyond individual human cases to broader areas of misconduct, she said, citing as examples claims against corporations for environmental damage and for actions during the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>Like the Filartiga case and the Karadzic verdict, many such cases bring huge monetary awards, but few plaintiffs ever collect.</p>
        <p>''Most people engaged in this type of litigation would say the power is the power of publicity and the very important symbolic impact of allowing the victims to tell their story,'' Ms. Slaughter said. ''If they do recover that would be great but that is not the point of the litigation.''</p>
        <p>One of the few cases likely to result in money changing hands was filed against Ferdinand Marcos, the former leader of the Philippines. Robert Swift, who represented 9,539 people who sued Mr. Marcos before his death in 1989, won a $2 billion judgment in federal court in Hawaii in 1995. The plaintiffs settled with Mr. Marcos's estate and with the Philippines' government for $161 million, Mr. Swift said. But he said the payment has been blocked by a judge in the Philippines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Swift said that while he recognized the political importance of such civil cases, that was not his main motivation. ''My involvement in this whole line of cases is to try to get compensation for the victims,'' he said. ''I have never been satisfied with a simple declaration that the abuse occurred.''</p>
        <p>By far the largest settlements have involved the cases brought in American courts by Holocaust survivors against banks and corporations they accused of profiting from the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>Although concerns have been raised that the success of the Holocaust suits could lead to other -- less legitimate -- lawsuits, representatives of the plaintiffs say it is an important step in the recognition that certain  rights do not stop at national borders.</p>
