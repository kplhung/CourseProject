        <p>No self-respecting candidate for public office -- be it president, congressman or county commissioner -- gets on the stump these days without having something to say about education. Sometimes it seems as if everyone's running for school board.</p>
        <p>Some call for higher standards for teachers or their charges. Others think vouchers are the answer, so parents can choose public or private schools. Some politicians cheer for charter schools. Others promise billions for classroom construction or universal prekindergarten. No doubt about it: public education is having its moment in the political sun.</p>
        <p>But the people who actually work in the schools or send their children there are less than impressed. Interviews with teachers, school officials and parents in the New York metropolitan region found a good deal of cynicism that regards all the talk as just talk, a popular way to get votes.</p>
        <p>There is worry that fundamental factors of a quality education, like parental involvement, are being overlooked in favor of fads, and that few candidates take the time to understand the problems that lead to a poor education. No deep foreboding was detected; some ideas sound good, people said. But neither was there much wild enthusiasm. How often, many people wondered, do politicians actually come through?</p>
        <p>''You have to have something to talk about,'' said April Jones-White, the president of the Hempstead Board of Education on Long Island. ''They've got to find a new arena, and education has not been the arena'' until now, she added.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Jones-White's tone was agitated. Even with all the talk, she has not heard much about several topics she cares about passionately, including parental involvement and cultivating relationships between schools and local businesses. ''The dropout rate is alarming, and children are having children,'' she said. ''I am looking for more creative programming, and I don't see it.''</p>
        <p>Slightly more optimistic but also more wary is Robert Burns, principal of Public School 86 in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. He said he wanted to believe that some good would come from the various education proposals offered by George W. Bush and Al Gore, but expressed concern about just what that might be. He has no taste for vouchers that allow school choice, as Mr. Bush advocates, and is equally wary of shuttering failing schools, as Mr. Gore has proposed. But, he contended, a way to improve schools can be found.</p>
        <p>''Inevitably, something good will come of it,'' Mr. Burns said of the attention to education, ''even though they never approach it in a totally logical sense.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns presides over a school in which three-quarters of the 570 students are black or Hispanic and nearly everyone is poor enough to qualify for free lunch. Yet he has been praised by city officials and independent groups because his students have performed better than those from similar socioeconomic backgrounds at other schools. As the principal, he faces real obstacles to good education -- the necessity of hiring uncertified teachers, the sometimes troubled home lives of his pupils and the state and city pressure to keep test scores up, up, up. But he also believes in pushing his students and teachers to overcome their obstacles.</p>
        <p>The current debate over education, Mr. Burns said, lacks the complexity to examine educational problems in depth.</p>
        <p>''A plumber who comes to your house is not going to concentrate on the whole house,'' he said. ''He is going to use certain tools to fix certain pipes. That's what we need. Certain things work for certain situations.''</p>
        <p>Ronald O. Ross, the superintendent of the Mount Vernon school district, among the poorest in the state, has worked as a teacher and administrator for more than 30 years. He has heard a lot of talk, he said, and it never seems to be quite on the mark.</p>
        <p>''I can walk into the Wal-Mart or Home Depot, and the clerk at the cash register will have no compunction about telling me how I should run the Mount Vernon school system,'' Mr. Ross said. ''Everybody's an expert.''</p>
        <p>The overriding problem, as he sees it, is a dearth of independent research on what actually works. The slightest whiff of apparent success -- a limited study asserting that test scores went up for some students who received vouchers to attend private schools, say -- yields a headlong, and possibly misplaced, rush of support, he said.</p>
        <p>''Vouchers and charter schools will never save public education, and everybody knows that,'' said Mr. Ross, who contends that early promising results have more to do with the fact that children whose parents went to the trouble of choosing a school are likely to care a great deal about education. And that advantage is hard to replicate. ''If you want me to educate everybody, give me the resources to do it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Curtis McCall Jr., a father of four from the Parkchester section of the Bronx, hears a lot of ambitious proposals, but is still not sure what they would do to solve overcrowding in his children's schools or attract more competent administrators. Vouchers? That might work if everybody got them, Mr. McCall said. Charter schools? If everybody could go. Too often, though, the big ideas, and even some of the simpler ones, never get off the ground.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes they start talking about building a school and then it just falls through,'' Mr. McCall said. ''They say teachers are not experienced, and then they keep hiring inexperienced teachers. Everybody says something about what they're going to do, and then it's like they forget about it. They forget about the low-income people.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps people expect too much. Candidates on the stump, even those who are running for school board, cannot possibly deliver on everything. Education is infinitely complex; what works in one school or a classroom may not work in the next.  Then there is the multilayer system of school financing, with money flowing from local, state and federal governments.</p>
        <p>Washington, for instance, contributes just 7 cents of every dollar spent on education in the country, although large urban districts get a bit more. For example, 10 percent of the $10 billion that New York City spends on education each year comes from the federal government. And almost all of that money comes with strings attached, to pay for programs for poor children and the disabled.</p>
        <p>Whatever the source of the money, how it is spent can be greatly influenced by a president or a senator or a mayor through ''the bully pulpit and the tone'' they set, said Augusta Kappner, the president of the Bank Street College of Education in Manhattan and a former assistant secretary of education in the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>''All administrations and all parties have to learn that there is no one-size-fits-all answer,'' Dr. Kappner said. ''There is so much community diversity.''</p>
        <p>Diane Ravitch, a New York University education historian and an assistant secretary of education in the Bush administration, said she was not surprised that so many candidates have jumped on the education bandwagon.</p>
        <p>''Polls show, for the American public education is a big concern,'' Dr. Ravitch said. ''I think that reflects not that education is in trouble but that people are fairly happy.''</p>
        <p>But as she listens to the debates between various candidates, particularly Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush, she wonders if people will come to expect too much from the winners. ''There is a certain unreality to this because what Washington does best is send money back,'' Dr. Ravitch said. ''They don't have the capacity to run programs. The responsibility and accountability is still going to be at the local level.''</p>
        <p>Even so, people like the president of the New York State School Boards Association, Edward McCormick, say they sense an opportunity to capitalize on all the political discussion.</p>
        <p>''We have to take an active role in shaping the agenda in terms of how it is actually deployed,'' said Mr. McCormick, a member of the Arlington school board in Dutchess County, who subscribes to a panning-for-gold theory: the best solutions will be left after voters sift through all discussion and debate.</p>
        <p>''It seems like both parties are trying to outdo each other,'' Mr. McCormick said. ''I think that's wonderful. Let the battle begin. What should happen out of all that, unless this is the greatest con game of the past two centuries, is some meaningful, productive changes for children.''</p>
