        <p>OLSON-Carl E. Thelen Reid &amp; Priest LLP, mourns the loss of a friend and colleague. Carl joined the former Reid &amp; Priest during WWII and then served in the US Army. Upon his return, he rejoined Reid &amp; Priest and was elected partner. Carl was highly regarded by his peers for his excellent lawyering and drafting skills. He was a leading figure in the firm's Latin America practice, especially in dealing with electric facilities in Latin America. Carl was a person of great integrity and personable character. We extend our most sincere sympathy to his wife Ila Olson and family members.</p>
