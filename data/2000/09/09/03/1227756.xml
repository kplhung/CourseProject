        <p>To get any more involved in the battles at Bayreuth, the German theater that Wagner built for his operas only, Alberto W. Vilar would have to grab a sword, jump on stage and give young Siegfried a hand. Wielding a checkbook instead, Mr. Vilar, who runs the Amerindo mutual fund firm, has come to the aid of Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's 80-year-old grandson and long the director of the Wagner Festival. Mr. Wagner would like to install his second wife, Gudrun, as director and retain a major role. But his niece, Nike Wagner, has recruited her own powerful allies to oust him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vilar, already one of the Metropolitan Opera's largest donors (it's not called the Vilar Grand Tier for nothing), has also become Bayreuth's largest private supporter, agreeing to sponsor a new production of ''Tannhauser'' in 2002. He said that under Mr. Wagner, the house gets 500,000 orders for 50,000 seats. ''And to turn around and say you need new blood, he's tired and old, that's wrong,'' Mr. Vilar said last week. ''All this criticism, and you have one of jewels of the business.''</p>

        <p>Mr. Vilar, calling the family feud in part ''a journalistic opera,'' notes that wealthy donors, especially Americans, have come under attack for becoming involved at all in such European institutions.</p>
