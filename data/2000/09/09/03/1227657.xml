        <p>With the opening of its regional headquarters in White Plains, Entergy Nuclear Northeast, a subsidiary of the New Orleans-based Entergy Corporation, will generate millions of dollars in taxes and local spending, County Executive Andrew J. Spano said. The company, which in March bought the Indian Point 3 nuclear reactor in Buchanan and the James A. FitzPatrick nuclear plant in Oswego, will move into three floors of the AT&amp;T. building on Hamilton Avenue, said Carl W. Crawford, a company spokesman. The move will establish 50 new jobs. He said the company has a two-year lease and is committed to staying in New York State for at least seven years.</p>
