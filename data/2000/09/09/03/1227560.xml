        <p>JOSH FINK always wanted to be a doctor. As a child he was weaned on TV shows like ''Medical Center'' and ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'' He was a biology major in college and went to medical school soon afterward. By the time he was 33, he was board certified as both an internist and a pulmonologist.</p>
        <p>When Dr. Fink hung out his shingle as a sole practitioner in Mount Kisco in 1994, his future as a doctor seemed promising. But two years ago, at 37, Dr. Fink went into a sort of semi-retirement as a doctor.</p>
        <p>It was managed care that soured him on the profession he had always revered, he said. ''I loved being a doctor,'' he said. ''But then I met this evil Oxford empire and things started crumbling.''</p>
        <p>When Dr. Fink told his colleagues about his career plans, he was primed for a certain amount of flak.</p>
        <p>''People looked down on me,'' he recalled. ''They made a lot of obnoxious comments.''</p>
        <p>Such as?</p>
        <p>''Does it make your parents proud that they worked so hard to put you through medical school and you opened a gym instead?''</p>
        <p>That's right -- a gym. But not your run-of-the-mill health club. Dr. Fink's gym in Chappaqua, Prescriptions for Fitness, is the only medically supervised one-on-one personal training center in the county.</p>
        <p>''Most people are lucky if they see a doctor for 10 minutes at an office visit,'' Dr. Fink said. He added that, as a trainer, ''I work with my clients for an hour two to three times a week.''</p>
        <p>Despite the name, Dr. Fink doesn't prescribe medications for his clients but sees them in his new profession as a certified personal fitness instructor. Together with his partner, Scott Reilly, also a personal trainer, and 10 other trainers with backgrounds in massage therapy, bodybuilding and yoga, Dr. Fink serves more than 250 clients a week.</p>
        <p>Some of those clients, like Dr. Barry Baer, an anesthesiologist at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, used to be Dr. Fink's colleagues. ''Josh and I have worked hand-in-hand together on surgeries,'' Dr. Baer said. ''He's a very competent doctor.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Baer admitted to feeling both surprise and disappointment when he found out about Dr. Fink's career change. ''Josh is a very bright, intelligent guy,'' he said. ''He's also one of those people who is unstoppable once he puts his mind to something.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago Dr. Baer sought out Dr. Fink at his fitness center while recovering from a pulmonary embolism. That visit resulted in Dr. Baer's making a regular commitment to working out at Prescriptions for Fitness. Having a doctor at the helm didn't hurt. ''It gave me a lot of confidence,'' Dr. Baer said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fink still maintains a small medical practice in Mount Kisco, seeing on average 50 patients monthly. Although he and his partner drew no salary from the fitness club for the first six months, he said his present income is about the same as when he was in full-time medical practice.</p>
        <p>''I went to medical school to help heal, not to become a boutique physician,'' he said. ''Instead I found myself spending time on the telephone begging insurance companies to cover CAT scans for my patients.'' As his overhead went up, Dr. Fink found his income drop. ''I just got tired of fighting Oxford to get the money I was fairly owed.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Fink no longer accepts insurance co-payments from his patients. ''But what that also means,'' he said, ''is I can spend an hour with a patient now instead of being forced to see 30 patients a day.''</p>
        <p>He has also managed to parlay his medical training to develop partnerships that other health clubs can only dream of. Prescriptions for Fitness is an affiliate of New York Bone and Joint, the orthopedic institute of Beth Israel Medical Center. The affiliation means that Prescriptions for Fitness is teaching its trainers, in cooperation with the doctors at the institute, how to help clients exercise safely. Dr. Fink is also negotiating with both Beth Israel and Northern Westchester hospitals to open off-site hospital-affiliated personal training centers.</p>
        <p>''We've become a liaison between the medical community and the fitness community,'' Dr. Fink said.</p>
        <p>Beyond the founder's background, what seems to draw clients to is the gym's personal and intimate atmosphere.</p>
        <p>At first glance, it appears much like any other health club, with the usual cardiovascular and strength-and-conditioning equipment, free weights, spinning bicycles and treadmills. No more than six people are scheduled to work out at any one time. Trainers come in early or stay late to accommodate a busy commuter's schedule. The staff attends weekly meetings with Dr. Fink and Mr. Reilly, going over each client's progress and goals.</p>
        <p>There is no membership fee; training sessions run $55 to $75 an hour.</p>
        <p>''They work you to your potential,'' said Tara Rutman of Chappaqua, who works out at Prescriptions for Fitness twice a week. ''They are also incredibly friendly and really care about each individual.''</p>
        <p>''I have the best of both worlds,'' said Dr. Fink, as he left for a meeting with an obstetrician who plans to develop pre-  and post-natal exercise classes at the gym. ''I love what I do for a living.''</p>
