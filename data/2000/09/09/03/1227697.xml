        <p>Photos of children from around the world, posing with their most prized possessions</p>

        <p>POSSESSION is a strange thing. It begins in childhood. If you ask children anywhere, from Turkey to Thailand, from Siberia to Ivory Coast, they can immediately identify the object they cherish most.</p>
        <p>Photographers commissioned by The New York Times asked children to pose with their most prized possessions. If these pictures say anything at all, it is that most children prefer at least two points of contact with their beloved object -- that is, two hands, or a hand and a face. The children do not just point. They encircle their objects. They hold their dolls, their soccer balls and their animals -- stuffed or live -- close to their bodies.</p>

        <p>POSSESSION is a strange thing. It begins in childhood. If you ask children anywhere, from Turkey to Thailand, from Siberia to Ivory Coast, they can immediately identify the object they cherish most.</p>
        <p>Photographers commissioned by The New York Times asked children to pose with their most prized possessions. If these pictures say anything at all, it is that most children prefer at least two points of contact with their beloved object -- that is, two hands, or a hand and a face. The children do not just point. They encircle their objects. They hold their dolls, their soccer balls and their animals -- stuffed or live -- close to their bodies.</p>
        <p>You have to look twice to see that Elif, an 8-year-old in Agni, Turkey, and Julie, a 9-year-old in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, are not holding real babies.</p>
        <p>And heaven help anyone who tries to pry the soccer ball from the mittened hands of Gennady, in Novokuznetsk, Siberia, or the stuffed horse from the arms of Ally, an 8-year old in upstate New York.</p>
        <p>The only child here who holds his possession at all lightly is Kouichirou, a 11-year-old Japanese boy, who plays with his Yugiou Duel Monster cards every day for two hours.</p>
        <p>Naturally, the wealthier have the fanciest toys.</p>
        <p>Christopher, a 12-year-old in suburban Maryland, got a new red kayak. Varadis, a 9-year-old in Bangkok, has three dogs, all of whom he considers his favorite. But he was only able  to hold one, named Santa Monica, for the  photographer.</p>
        <p>Even those who have next to nothing, though, manage to locate and claim something in the world that they love best.</p>
        <p>Two 10-year-old boys in Istanbul, Emre and Yunus, found their favorite possession abandoned in their neighborhood -- a rusted car that they pretend to race.</p>
        <p>Masupa, 12, who lives in a Bangkok slum, lost her doll when her family's house burned down. Now her favorite thing is her piggy bank.</p>
