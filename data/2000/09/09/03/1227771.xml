        <p>When Isaac Bruce caught the game-winning 73-yard touchdown pass in Super Bowl XXXIV, he could have kept running and zipped right into the 2000 National Football League season. Because Bruce and his St. Louis Rams, along with teams like the Minnesota Vikings, the Indianapolis Colts and the Washington Redskins, are swaying offenses back to the vertical passing game.</p>
        <p>The hunger for big plays this season -- runs of 20 yards or more and passes of 40 yards or more -- will be insatiable. The intent to snatch them will be incessant. Teams will yearn for big plays to erupt in the running game. They will insist on their surfacing in the passing game.</p>
        <p>In the last Super Bowl, the Rams' offense flew and the Tennessee Titans' offense crept. The Rams gained a 16-0 lead before the Titans caught them, in part with two seven-minute touchdown drives. Then one play from Kurt Warner to Bruce, one 73-yard strike, and St. Louis led. And it won, 23-16, when Tennessee again could not produce enough big plays, driving instead the length of the field only to fall a yard short as time expired.</p>
        <p>That, as well as the champion Rams' penchant all season for the vertical game, the big pass play over the top, the deep strike, left an impression that colors N.F.L. 2000.</p>
        <p>''There is a trend there and you see it the more you watch tape getting ready for the season,'' said Ted Cottrell, defensive coordinator for the Buffalo Bills. ''It's upfield more with receivers. They are getting deeper and deeper in their cuts.''</p>
        <p>And drastically changing momentum with big plays. ''You can play great defense and give up three big plays and that's 21 points,'' said Gary Crowton, offensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears. ''Defenses get more comfortable the longer drives go on. Offenses are responding to that by taking more deep shots.''</p>
        <p>Bill Belichick, the New England Patriots' head coach, said that the desire for big plays ''has always been there, this year, last year and 10 years before that.''</p>
        <p>''They're going to go for it,'' he said. ''The question is when and how? You have to play a complementing game. You've got offense, defense and special teams, and rarely is a team so dominant in one area that it makes up for the others. There are very few '85 Bears, for example, that can win solely with defense.''</p>
        <p>Yet, Belichick added: ''Definitely, the big play is a killer because that's the quickest way to score, one shot. I know how explosive teams like St. Louis and Minnesota are and it's hard to play football at that pace. We have a lot of explosive players in our division, receivers like Eric Moulds in Buffalo and Marvin Harrison in Indianapolis, who can turn a game in a second. That's what keeps us up at night. In the end, only two stats matter -- points scored and points given up. And teams not giving up points don't give up big plays.''</p>
        <p>Playoff teams and Super Bowl champions, however, make them.</p>
        <p>The Rams last season were the only team to reach double digits in 40-yard-plus passing touchdowns, producing 11. They also led the league in 40-yard-plus passing completions with 17.</p>
        <p>Check out the teams that topped the league in average net yards per pass play. The Rams led with a 7.73-yard average. Six of the top 10 teams earned a playoff berth. None of the 10 suffered a losing record. Conversely, none of the top 10 defenses at limiting net average yards per pass play suffered a losing record and six of them made the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The West Coast offense -- short, crisp, timing patterns, hitch tosses to receivers and flares to backs in the flat -- has been the league's favored attack in recent years. It was an answer to all-out blitzes that helped negate the vertical game, which usually requires maximum pass protection, a deeper quarterback drop and the quarterback holding the ball longer. Defenses have responded by moving closer to the line of scrimmage, taking away the underneath passes, placing linebackers and safeties on the flanks to negate the flares. Defenses have crept closer and closer.</p>
        <p>Offenses want them to back off.</p>
        <p>''Defenses are really challenging you and it's getting congested,'' said Kevin Gilbride, offensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers. ''They are taking away more and more of the short game. Now, you can still run whatever you want as your base offense, but you've got to go vertical more frequently now to free your offense. It's the game.''</p>
        <p>Just Pass, Baby</p>
        <p>This is amusing to Al Davis, the Oakland Raiders' owner.</p>
        <p>Davis, 71, has been a coach, a commissioner and an owner in pro football. Before Bill Walsh perfected the West Coast offense, Don Coryell perfected timing passing. Before Coryell was Sid Gillman's zany blend of short and deep passing.</p>
        <p>For 35 years, however, Davis has been connected to the vertical game.</p>
        <p>''We like to think we started it -- the deep strike,'' Davis said. ''Ours was done with power running and the combination would put fear and pressure on the opponent. It was not about location, scheme and personnel. You were not going to stop us from going deep. You had to prove it on the field. We had games going in, one in '68 against the Jets and Weeb Ewbank, where he said, above all else, they were going to stop us from going deep. But it was what we wanted to do and what we did do. They knew where we were. We knew where they were. They didn't stop us.</p>
        <p>''In order for the vertical game to work, you have to have one focal point for the defense to consider, a receiver with tremendous speed. You'd like to be at least above 50 percent. You'd like to avoid interceptions and have a good yards-per-catch average. But what I cared about most were touchdowns.''</p>
        <p>Though the Raiders in recent seasons have concentrated less on the vertical game, it will always be a part of their offense, Davis said.</p>
        <p>''The deep ball is back, no question,'' he said. ''And one of the reasons why is you have a new group of quarterbacks whose game is more suited to throw the football upfield. You know, Tennessee last year used power running, took shots once in a while, had a quarterback who ran the ball well and used clock management. The vertical game? They were not willing to do it. But I think Steve McNair can do it. Most of the young quarterbacks in here now can do it. And he can probably do it the best of the young ones.</p>
        <p>''You will not have a vertical game unless that coach wants to do it and is willing to do it. Bill Parcells had that great defense with the Giants and ran the ball and won a couple of Super Bowls that way. But when he came back to coaching, even he had to get out of that rut. Nowadays, you have to score.''</p>
        <p>Davis said the leading coaches in today's vertical game include Dennis Green of Minnesota, Brian Billick of Baltimore, Dan Reeves of Atlanta and Mike Martz of St. Louis.</p>
        <p>''I used to kid Mike Holmgren and Ron Wolf in Green Bay about their 15-yard wall,'' Davis said. ''I would tell them to throw the ball past that imaginary wall they've set up. And then when they won a Super Bowl, what got them started was a deep strike to Antonio Freeman. Wolf later told me he was thinking of me when that play happened. The first time I met Mike Martz was after the last Super Bowl and I told him what he was doing was great. Keep breaking down that wall.''</p>
        <p>Some of the best vertical game combinations Davis has seen are the Jets' Joe Namath to Don Maynard, the Chiefs' Len Dawson to Otis Taylor, the Rams' Norm Van Brocklin to Tom Fears, the Cowboys' Don Meredith to Bob Hayes, and the Steelers' Terry Bradshaw to Lynn Swann and John Stallworth.</p>
        <p>''This league has always been more interested in explosion on offense,'' Davis said. ''Every rule change I can remember is predicated first on safety and then to increase the offense. The vertical game is back now and elements of it will always be here. Defenses must know that whether on first, second or third down you have to play the deep ball or you are going to get beat. A true vertical game will not let location, design or scheme dictate you. You take the deep strike. A lot of it boils down to the guy calling the play. He has to have the will to do it.''</p>
        <p>Rams Revel in Big Plays</p>
        <p>The Rams certainly exude that type of moxie. ''We are what we are -- a team that will not hold back whether we are on your 4-yard line or on our own,'' Martz said. ''We made a commitment to that last season and you will see it again this season.''</p>
        <p>The Rams toss a variety of big-play schemes at opponents.</p>
        <p>''This offense was put together with the idea of throwing so many weapons at a defense and stretching defenses from sidelines to end zones that they become too thin,'' said Kurt Warner, the Rams' quarterback and the most valuable player of the Super Bowl. ''When you put pressure on cornerbacks and safeties to defend the deep ball, and you keep putting that pressure on them, you're working on their minds. The big play is the one thing they fear and want to defend most. When you get it, you break down the defense in a way that not only shows up on the scoreboard but also in their psyche.''</p>
        <p>The Bills' Cottrell said that of recent Super Bowl champions, the Rams receivers and passing game ranked among the best.</p>
        <p>''The Rams, my goodness, those guys on the outside really fly up the field,'' Cottrell said. ''And they have a back in Marshall Faulk that keeps you honest in defending the running game, which is something an offense needs for the big play. That helps make it click for them.''</p>
        <p>Mike Shanahan, the Broncos' coach, has studied the Rams closely. Denver plays at St. Louis tomorrow night in the teams' season opener.</p>
        <p>''They have Torry Holt, Isaac Bruce and Az-Zahir Hakim, three receivers who can go deep or catch a 5-yard hitch pass and turn it into a long route,'' Shanahan said. ''Not every team has that kind of explosiveness and tries to get the big play from the quick dump, the catch and run. You need that home-run player, the skill of a Holt or a Bruce, and that's what people are looking for. It's about playing aggressive and taking chances.''</p>
        <p>He added, however: ''It's about balance, though. Because if all you do is throw the ball downfield, you won't be coaching in the N.F.L. very long. You'll be fired.''</p>
        <p>That is what makes the vertical game risky, Walsh, the former San Francisco 49ers coach and current team vice president, said.</p>
        <p>''This could be interesting to watch for the year -- can you drop back and throw the ball deep downfield and waste a down if you don't get it?'' Walsh said. ''I'm for it. Our deep game was Jerry Rice and John Taylor catching the short ball and running with it. If you don't have receivers like that, you've got to find another way to go deep and put pressure on the defense. But is your offense capable of making a first down when you don't complete the deep, vertical pass? That's the question.''</p>
        <p>Colts Go Out, Then Up</p>
        <p>Peyton Manning, the Colts' quarterback, said the vertical game required especially effective pass protection. He said one of the best ways the Colts set up their vertical game was by running the big pass play off patterns already run in a game; for example, a 10-yard out pass will be run three times and on the fourth time becomes an up route. The Colts love to run off-tackle repeatedly and then play-fake and throw deep. They were second last season to the Rams in average net yards per pass play.</p>
        <p>''You have to be persistent in creating big plays,'' Manning said. ''If you seek them, though, they come. For a quarterback, especially early in the game, the big play is a great momentum lifter and it gets the entire team going.''</p>
        <p>Robert Porcher, a dominating defensive end for Detroit, said the Lions' defense talked about preventing big plays in training camp and each week during the season.</p>
        <p>''It can put you in a hole that you somehow never get out of,'' Porcher said of an offense's big plays. ''Guys like myself make a living by trying to get to that quarterback and keep them from happening. Our division is where the vertical game lives. Randy Moss in Minnesota starts it, and other receivers like Marcus Robinson in Chicago, Antonio Freeman in Green Bay and now Keyshawn Johnson in Tampa Bay will keep it going. We've got Herman Moore and Germane Crowell and Johnnie Morton and they create chaos and big plays. This entire league has a lot of gunslinging quarterbacks who can throw it downfield and receivers who can go catch it.''</p>
        <p>For defenses this season, combating the vertical game is all about pressuring the quarterback, safeties who can cover vast areas and sure tackling in the open field.</p>
        <p>For offenses, it is all about will, intent and shoving defenses back with more vertical passing.</p>
        <p>It's the game.</p>
