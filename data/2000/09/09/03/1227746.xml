        <p>THE bond market this year has outperformed the stock market for the first time in a decade, and Dr. Edward Yardeni, chief global economist and investment strategist at Deutsche Bank Securities, forecasts that aging baby boomers will help keep the bond rally going.</p>
        <p>''I predict that the 10-year government bond yield might fall to 5 percent by the end of next year,'' he said, from its current 5.68 percent, ''and to 4.5 percent by the middle of the decade.'' As the bond's yield falls, of course, its price rises, giving investors a higher total return.</p>
        <p>In making a case for bonds amid strong economic growth, Dr. Yardeni points to a statistical measure, called the ''age wave,'' that he developed many years ago.</p>
        <p>Although some other prognosticators are skeptical of the measure's predictive value, Dr. Yardeni's arguments are food for thought. The age wave tracks the percentage of the labor force that is 16 to 34 years old; as baby boomers have aged, the age wave has fallen.</p>
        <p>The path of that wave has been roughly parallel to that of inflation and the 10-year government bond yield. All three hit a trough in the early 1960's, crested during the first half of the 1980's and have generally been falling since.</p>
        <p>''Looking back now,'' Dr. Yardeni said, ''it turns out that this wave has been remarkably well correlated with the wave of both inflation and the bond yield,'' a trend that he has forecast will last until 2010, when significant numbers of baby boomers are retired.</p>
        <p>Dr. Yardeni, who began to write about the impact of demographics on markets in the late 1980's, contends that there are sound reasons for the correlation. As the baby boomers have aged, he argues, productivity has improved, because older workers have more experience than younger ones and are more committed to their jobs. ''Faster productivity growth,'' he said, ''would be an important source of disinflationary pressure, pushing bond yields lower.''</p>
        <p>He also said that older baby boomers tended to favor tax cuts and less government spending. As the government buys back debt securities and issues fewer Treasuries, there has been increased investor demand for those securities.</p>
        <p>The age wave, meanwhile, has continued to fall. Having peaked at 51 percent during January 1981, the percentage of the work force that is 16 to 34 is now down to 38 percent. The five-year moving average of the inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, is down to 2.4 percent, just above where it should be, based on the age wave. And the five-year moving average of the 10-year Treasury note, at 5.71 percent, is about two percentage points above where the age wave suggests it could be. One economist who considers a yield drop of that size highly unlikely is Brian L. Beaulieu, director of the Institute for Trend Research in Contoocook, N.H., although he is still bullish on bonds, at least for the near term. ''I think Dr. Yardeni has some valid points,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But when it comes to using the age wave to predict bond yields, he added: ''I think his assumptions do not bear up under close scrutiny. The past is not necessarily prologue -- other factors will affect the market. For instance, almost no one is looking at Japan, a huge wild card. Its economy could slip back into a severe recession.''</p>
        <p>Looking at bonds, for the near term to 12 months, Mr. Beaulieu favors government issues over corporates. ''I'm confident about U.S. government bond yields,'' he said, ''but I'm not confident about corporate rates, because there is still a fair amount of inflationary pressure within the economy.</p>
        <p>''In the intermediate term, going out to 2003, both sides of the bond markets will prosper,'' he said, ''while in the post-2003 period I think all the potential is on the downside for bonds. There is a significant inflationary cycle headed toward us and that is going to be sending bond prices tumbling.''</p>
        <p>Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Fleming Asset Management, had a different response to the issue of the age wave and bond yields. ''Putting aside the powers of various theories, I have only two thoughts concerning what lies beyond 2010,'' he said. ''One, I hope to still be alive, and two, I hope the planet is still in one piece.''</p>
