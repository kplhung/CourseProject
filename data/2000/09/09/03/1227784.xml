        <p>As the academic year begins for the nation's 53 million students, a growing number of schools are rudderless, struggling to replace a graying corps of principals at a time when the pressure to raise test scores and other new demands have made an already difficult job an increasingly thankless one.</p>
        <p>In Vermont, one of every five principals has retired or resigned in the last few months alone, some of them replaced temporarily by other principals who had retired several years earlier.</p>
        <p>In Washington State, nearly 300 principals, or 15 percent of the total, left their jobs at the end of the last school year, with some of them moving to the private sector and others taking their pensions to Idaho, Oregon, Nevada and California, where desperate districts are offering signing bonuses and other perks, according to Washington school officials.</p>
        <p>In Kentucky and Texas, where the pace at which principals are fleeing is as accelerated as it is in Vermont, job openings in some districts that drew more than a dozen applicants as recently as five years ago are now attracting as few as three, according to principals' associations there.</p>
        <p>And in New York City, which has been unwilling to compete with suburbs that pay principals as much as $20,000 more a year, 163 schools will open this week with a temporary administrator welcoming students back from summer vacation. The vacancies, when combined with the 200 schools that opened with interim principals last September, mean that more than one in four principals' posts turned over in New York in less than two years.</p>
        <p>Those who have departed in recent months, in New York and elsewhere, often cite the mounting stress of a job that once mostly involved establishing an orderly and nurturing environment for learning, and displaying a firm disciplinary hand. But during the movement to improve schools that has swept through classrooms over the last decade, the principal has become as visibly accountable as a football coach, and must suffer the wrath of parents and state monitors if a school has a losing season, as measured by falling test scores and unmet statewide standards. In some instances principals are being fired with no clear successor waiting in the wings.</p>
        <p>Once given wide latitude, the principal has seen his autonomy hemmed in: the movement has spawned thousands of school governing councils, in which parents, teachers and community members weigh in on every matter before the principal -- from teacher hiring to lunchroom menus -- with the principal left to forge consensus. Meanwhile, newly savvy parents have seized on obscure passages in special-education law to wring additional services for their children, leaving principals buried in thick binders of federal and state statutes like beleaguered young lawyers.</p>
        <p>''You want them to have a legal background and a business sense, to know children and child development and adult development, plus statistics, accounting and certainly technology,'' said Robbe Brook, the superintendent of the Washington Central Supervisory Union in central Vermont, who had to fill vacancies at three of her five elementary schools this summer, two of them with temporary hires.</p>
        <p>And then there is safety. Highly publicized shootings like those at Columbine High School in Colorado last year have forced some principals to affect the hawklike vigilance of Secret Service agents, panning the cafeteria for the early warning signals of an attack.</p>
        <p>Around the time of the Columbine massacre, John Willard, the principal of Colchester High School in northern Vermont, fielded five bomb threats in five weeks -- each necessitating that he spend the night with the police, combing hallways in search of suspicious packages. After 12 years in the principal's office, Mr. Willard, 52, resigned last year to return to his math classroom, accepting a $14,000 pay cut -- to $53,000 from $67,000 -- even though he had two children in college.</p>
        <p>''You start adding things up and saying, 'Jeez, this isn't fun anymore,' '' Mr. Willard said.</p>
        <p>Never mind that such jobs are usually among the highest-paying in public education. Neal Powell, the superintendent of schools in the small Snohomish district, 30 miles north of Seattle, lost three of his nine elementary school principals this summer. In replacing them, he tapped a shallow pool almost entirely filled with untested rookies. The starting salary he was offering was a respectable $72,768, much more than the $50,000 that is often the standard for principals in rural districts.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the young stars, people we identify in the teaching ranks, increasingly they turn to us and say, 'We see what our principal does, we don't want to do it,' '' Mr. Powell said.</p>
        <p>The vacancies are only expected to grow.</p>
        <p>Most of the nation's 120,000 public school principals began working in education in the 1970's -- the median age is about 50, according to national surveys -- and many will be eligible to retire within five years. And teachers are retiring, too, at a time when districts need more of them to reduce class sizes; the nation is expected to hire two million new teachers in the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>To fill the chair in the principal's office, schools are often making one-year appointments, twisting the arms of veteran teachers or turning to not-so-recent retirees. But those patched-together arrangements can be disruptive, with teachers unsure of what precisely they should be teaching and the principal striving to make an impact as an acknowledged lame duck. All this in an environment where progress in reading and math is often tied to consistency.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, at 63, James King retired as the principal of a middle school in central Vermont to become a sports announcer, a dream he had harbored since the Korean War. But soon after his debut on a local radio station, Mr. King was lured out of the booth and flooded with offers to serve as a temporary principal at schools around this state.</p>
        <p>This week, just days before the doors opened at the 150-desk elementary school in Calais, a small town east of Montpelier, Mr. King set aside his dreams of radio stardom yet again to slide behind another principal's desk. He has committed to serve through June. It is his third interim principalship in three years, and his learning curve remains steep.</p>
        <p>He could not, for example, figure out how to turn on the laptop computer on his desk to compose a welcome message to his staff. And as the children's arrival loomed, he was still working on pronouncing his teachers' names correctly, when he was not reading ''Windows 98 for Dummies.''</p>
        <p>''My heart rate is tremendous,'' he told his staff, disarming any concerns about his age, and his health, in their first meeting. ''My sugar is low.''</p>
        <p>Mr. King, who was a principal for more than two decades in Vermont and New York, will need all the stamina he can muster in replacing his predecessor, who resigned in June, after four years, to work on a literacy project at the University of Vermont. Just after Mr. King was hired in mid-August, he had to join the search for a new teacher for a combined third- and fourth-grade class, a search he has since completed.</p>
        <p>Though his little red schoolhouse looks bucolic, with cows from a nearby farm wandering into recess, Mr. King must scale a mountain of new requirements from the state. A flow chart directs him to write new policies on promoting students, develop uniform curriculums throughout the building and devise an ''action plan'' for meeting the state's academic goals.</p>
        <p>As a reminder of what awaits his school if he fails, a front-page article in The Burlington Free Press on his first day listed 39 schools that were reprimanded by the state for ''substandard performance'' last year. That Calais Elementary was not among them gave Mr. King and his staff little comfort.</p>
        <p>In taking his temporary job, which pays an annual salary of $55,000, Mr. King had to suspend his Vermont pension for a year, so as not to be seen as double-dipping. But in an attempt to coax other retirees back to the main office, Kentucky and Maryland recently passed laws that permit retirees to take a principal's job and still draw their pensions.</p>
        <p>Those states, and others, are also working to make the principal's job more attractive to young recruits, often through paid internships that show them the job up close. More than a dozen educational foundations and nonprofit organizations are engaged in similar work, and last year Eli Broad, chairman of the Los Angeles-based financial services company Sun America, said he was setting aside $100 million for urban school systems, to help train principals and superintendents.</p>
        <p>A Boston-based organization called New Leaders for New Schools was recently formed solely to recruit, train and place principals in charter and other small public schools. And another new group, the School Leadership Project, financed by a grant from the Wallace-Reader's Digest Funds and based in Boston and Providence, R.I., has begun a ''residency program'' for aspiring principals based on a medical school model. Each candidate -- 10 are in a pilot program this year -- will be released from the classroom and assigned to a veteran principal for 18 months, taking on various projects.</p>
        <p>Larry Myatt, the principal of Fenway High School in Boston, said the program would help prospective principals make an informed decision on whether they could handle the new rigors of the principal's job -- a sense they might not get in a traditional, after-school master's degree program.</p>
        <p>''If you're a cobbler, you train in a shoe shop,'' said Mr. Myatt, who is a regional coordinator for the School Leadership Project. ''The idea of continuing to train principals for the crucible of leadership in night school is an idea that is now being reconsidered across the country.''</p>
