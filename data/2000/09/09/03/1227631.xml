        <p>Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. of Red Bank, the largest home builder in New Jersey, and a developer based in Landover, Md., announced last week that they planned to merge.</p>
        <p>While both companies used the term merger, Hovnanian, which has replaced many a farm with row upon row of townhouses, condominiums and single-family homes will essentially acquire the Maryland-based company, Washington Homes.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the deal, Hovnanian said it would buy out Washington's stockholders with cash or the equivalent in Hovnanian stock, worth a total of $77.4 million. Hovnanian said the merger with Washington, which builds similar projects, would put the company's total assets at about $1 billion, and extend its business further throughout the South, southern California, the Midwest and the New York Metropolitan-Washington, D.C., corridor.</p>
        <p>Hovnanian would assume debt of about $60 million, The Star-Ledger quoted Gaeton DeCesaris Jr., chairman, president and chief executive of Washington, as saying.</p>
        <p>Low share prices among some builders has led some to consider merger partners.</p>
