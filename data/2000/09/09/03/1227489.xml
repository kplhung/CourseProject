        <p>To the Editor: The article ''Sometimes, Smaller Is Better'' (Aug. 20) seemed to overlook the advantages of being on a large cruise ship. We have just returned from Alaska, where we spent a week on land and a week cruising the Inside Passage.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the weather was terrible; it rained every day. We were able to get close to the Mendenhall Glacier looming nearby, but could make it out only vaguely. Because we were on a large ship, we had a choice of many indoor activities to keep us busy and we enjoyed the company of other passengers while the rain accompanied us all the way to Vancouver.</p>
