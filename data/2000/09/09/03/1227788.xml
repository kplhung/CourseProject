        <p>Astronomers tell us that the light from dead stars reaches us long after those bodies are useless and cold, a metaphor we do not want to deal with this coming autumn in New York when Patrick Ewing and Mark Messier may once again be the suns around which their teammates and fans orbit. It could be time to call Madison Square the Gray Garden.</p>
        <p>As disturbing as such thoughts may be, they come at an opportune time, just as I declare my Olympic moratorium. This is when I actively suspend all my baser judgments. I disregard suspiciously muscled bodies and conveniently hypocritical arrangements. I try to look at the Games through Bud Greenspan's rosy lenses. I offer the Barons -- de Coubertin, Avery Brundage, Juan Antonio Samaranch, Dick Ebersol -- safe passage through the waste detectors of my mind. Just sit back and enjoy the show, I say, and remember that the Olympics, like ''Survivors'' and ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' is just a TV show.</p>
        <p>Which takes us back to the Patrick mess and standing pat with Mess. It's life imitating bad art. It is the Garden's version of ''Space Cowboys,'' a missable movie in which old guys who had been a finger roll away from getting into space 30 years ago get a second chance because the bureaucrats have something to hide. Of course we'll root for the codgers because the alternative is ''The Replacements,'' a must-miss movie (call it ''The Scab News Bears''). Haven't we had enough of somewhat appealing pick-ups not quite doing it for us?</p>
        <p>The Patrick and Mess sagas are as different as their sports and their personalities, but the common thread brings us, alas, back to the Olympics. While these two foreign-born guest workers have always given us their best in the arena, decisions about their job security have always been coldly pragmatic ones. Fair enough, especially since most recent Garden decisions have also been popular ones -- getting Gretzky, bringing in Latrell Sprewell, continuing the attempt to dump Ewing and buying back Messier.</p>
        <p>(Fans, for all their psychological dysfunction, do keep an eye on the bottom line. In an amusing America Online feature last week, the $275,000 home that a $30,000 worker might yearn for would comparatively cost a $12 million star -- say, Peyton Manning or David Cone -- only $687.50.)</p>
        <p>In the same vein, the Olympics have been making coldly pragmatic decisions that have been popular -- feminizing the Games beyond de Coubertin's most pre-Freudian fears, de-amateurizing the Games beyond Brundage's worst nightmares. The recent decision to test for EPO can lead one to believe that either the pharma-jocks have adequate masking agents or have gone beyond blood into the lymph system; there would be no testing unless Olympic officials were sure that no box office star would be busted.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, another old guy, Samaranch, seems to be in P.R. rehab. Last century's buzz around his Nobel Peace Prize bid has yet to resurface, but there is a softer tone to his profiles and writers tend to faintly apologize when they bring up his Franco/Fascist past. Why that should have anything to do with the expedient way Olympic decisions are made beats me.</p>
        <p>I was an unabashed Olympic fan until I actually got to one, in 1968, in Mexico City. A few days before the opening ceremony, a native showed me the plaza where student demonstrators had been machine-gunned. That story, like their blood and the hovels along the road from the airport, was scrubbed off the scoreboard for years.</p>
        <p>Those Games are best remembered for the mildest militant gesture of the era, the victory-stand black power salutes of Tommie Smith and John Carlos, and the hysterical official reaction. That's too bad because it obscures the incredible progress begun in those Games; the drugs got more effective, the television contracts grew richer, the athletic Cold War intensified and the shoe money showed up. Meanwhile, poor Tommie and John were scrubbed for years. One of their teammates, Tom Waddell, founded the Gay Olympics; before he died, he would lose his house during the Olympics' successful suit against his use of their Congress-given name. The Gay Games live on.</p>
        <p>While thelipsite@aol.com will be open for dialogue and diatribe, this space will be vacant for several weeks while I watch the Open (I would pay to see John McEnroe play either Williams sister), the Olympics, the pennant race and the football seasons.</p>
        <p>I'll especially be watching Tennessee; the administration and its media lackeys are concerned that Professor Linda Bensel-Meyers's whistle-blowing will cool the Vols' football fever. Faculty groups seem to be backing away from supporting her, even though her charges, which need to be thoroughly investigated by an objective group (i.e., not the National Collegiate Athletic Association), highlight academic complicity in college sports corruption. On the other hand, maybe we should just kick back and be happy that college football is just another coldly pragmatic TV show, like the Olympics.</p>
