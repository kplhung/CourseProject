        <p>WHEN students in Bethpage log onto the World Wide Web, they can e-mail questions to featured experts and celebrities, then get the answers posted on their computer screens. Last year, students corresponded with the actor Christopher Reeve, the film director Spike Lee, the television personality Katie Couric and James Watson, president of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.</p>
        <p>''Imagine being able to ask questions of a Nobel Prize winner about DNA and genetics, and having him answer them,'' said Terrence Clark, director of social studies and computers for the Bethpage school district. ''That's a resource we would never be able to provide on our own.''</p>
        <p>In Southampton, students can log onto their school's home page to find a calendar of events, as well as detailed information on clubs and after-school activities. When they are absent from school, they can also find some of their homework assignments online.</p>
        <p>For students in Jericho, virtual tours are now part of many lesson plans. When they study a unit on the presidents, students access the Internet and take a virtual tour of the White House, visiting each room as if they were inside. When they study the world's tropical regions, they travel via the Internet down the Amazon.</p>
        <p>''A decade ago, schools were just beginning to put computers in the classrooms, and nobody was hooked up to the Internet because it was too costly,'' said Lesley Kalish, a computer teacher in the Jericho school district. ''Today, everyone is wired, from kindergarten through high school, and the integration of text and technology is the direction of education for the future.''</p>
        <p>As more schools are gaining high-speed Internet access, teachers are integrating the Internet into their classrooms and learning how to use the new technology to help their students succeed.</p>
        <p>On the Island, Cablevision has launched an education initiative called Power to Learn. Since the program's inception last year, Cablevision has provided more than 350 public and private schools and 50 libraries on Long Island with high-speed, broadband Internet connections, at no charge.</p>
        <p>Based on the company's projections, by the end of this year more than 200,000 of the 500,000 students on the Island will have access to the Internet through Power to Learn.</p>
        <p>''Even little tiny schools with tiny budgets can get on line in a way we never thought we'd be able to,'' said Caryn Meirs, technology coordinator at Westbury Friends, where the number of classroom computers went from 5 to 30.</p>
        <p>More than just connections, the Cablevision program provides content: online resources available through their Web site, www.powertolearn.com.</p>
        <p>''Through Ask the Expert, students are given an opportunity to ask questions of leaders in business, science, entertainment and sports,'' said Lee Whitmore, Cablevision's vice president for education. ''There is a Teacher Lounge that fosters an exchange of information among educators, a Student Locker that lists a directory of Web resources including homework help, and a Parent Corner that facilitates online dialogue between parents and provides a directory of online resources on parenting topics.''</p>
        <p>For students, E-learning is also a way to share information with a greater audience, said Corinne Carriero, director of instructional computing for the Half Hollow Hills school district.</p>
        <p>''We take the students on field trips with digital cameras so they can document the theme and what they're doing,'' she said. ''When they come back, they can make electronic reports and put them on the Internet. For example, a high school physics class did experiments while on rides at Adventureland. They then put the report up on the Web site and added links to other sites, literally creating new knowledge for the whole world.''</p>
        <p>Many students are already comfortable in front of the computer. It's the teachers and parents who are intimidated.</p>
        <p>''Kids take to the Internet like ducks to water,'' Ms. Carriero said. ''They use it for entertainment and education. They download songs, find concert dates and search for information for research projects. But many teachers and parents are still afraid of the Internet and have had a hard time accepting that not everything has to be on paper.''</p>
        <p>In many districts, money has been allocated in school budgets for staff workshops to train teachers on integrating the Internet into their classroom instruction. This year, Cablevision will provide Internet training for more than 1,000 teachers on Long Island.</p>
        <p>At Westbury Friends, Ms. Meirs offers a Saturday morning workshop to help teachers become more comfortable with the Internet and to teach them effective ways to use computers in their classrooms.</p>
        <p>Of greater concern is that the increasing use of technology may reduce socialization among students and interaction between students and teachers, and between children and their parents.</p>
        <p>''I worry that the growing use of computers and time spent online can lead to isolation for our children,'' said Karen Walczuk, a Syosset mother of three. ''Just as I would never allow my children to have TV's in their bedrooms because it reduced socialization in our family, I'm afraid that to some extent, computers may have the same effect.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Whitmore dismissed these concerns. ''I don't see that as a problem,'' he said. ''In the course of a lesson, kids may work independently at their computer terminals, but then the teacher brings them back in. It's project-based learning that begins with 'let's talk about a topic,' then 'let's go find more information' and finally, 'let's come back together and discuss it.'</p>
        <p>''Clearly the future of education is the integration of technology and instruction,'' he said. ''The opportunities for this are endless.''</p>
        <p>In preparation for the second school year for Power to Learn, Cablevision recently assembled a focus group at Briarcliffe College in Bethpage, including about 40 teachers, administrators, parents and students from a variety of Long Island school districts.</p>
        <p>''We want to find out from you what works and what doesn't,'' Mr. Whitmore told the participants. ''We want to learn how we can make your lives easier by helping you find information at your fingertips.''</p>
        <p>In separate rooms, parents, teachers and students, each led by a facilitator, discussed their priorities.</p>
        <p>''My 10-year old daughter is more comfortable with the Internet and with sending e-mail than I am,'' said Laura Smalley, president of the PTSA Council of the Plainedge school district. ''The kids are using this technology so much that I'm anxious to learn what is the best way to use it as an educational tool.''</p>
        <p>A discussion group for students between 10 and 14 years old was led by Kristen Alexander, a developmental psychologist.</p>
        <p>''Have you ever used the Internet with your parents?'' she asked the group. Most shook their heads, except for one boy who remembered, ''Once I did when my dad was trying to get Yankee tickets.''</p>
        <p>The majority of the students agreed that they used e-mail and instant messaging most frequently, that they liked to play computer games, that at school they used the Internet primarily for research assignments, and that they didn't log on to their school's Web site very often, if at all. Most said that they are more computer savvy than their parents and sometimes have to show their parents how to do a search on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''How would you like to use the Internet more in school?'' Dr. Alexander asked.</p>
        <p>Tops on their list were homework help, posting grades, and easy access to announcements.</p>
        <p>Cablevision's agenda for the new school year includes several pilot projects based on distance learning, Dr. Whitmore said. Cablevision has been working with Long Island University and several districts in the Hamptons to link classrooms in different districts for common courses with interactive capability.</p>
        <p>''Through the use of mobile cameras and wireless microphones, students in all of the classrooms will be able to ask questions of teachers in a virtual classroom in real time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Work is also underway to provide access for students who are homebound to be able to interact with their teachers and fellow students in the classroom, Dr. Whitmore said.</p>
        <p>Online instruction allows Jonathan Brett, a 16-year-old from West Hempstead who suffers from a rare sleeping disorder known as Kleine-Levin Syndrome, to take courses in Advanced Placement American history and English. Jonathan, whose ailment prevents him from attending school regularly, received permission from the Sewanhaka school district to take the two courses online.</p>
        <p>''We've tried home tutoring,'' said his mother, Joy, ''but the quality of instruction was not always the best, and because of Jonathan's condition he experiences long periods of unconsciousness, sometimes for two to three weeks at a time, so he was not always available for his tutors. With online classes, Jonathan will be able to log on at any time of day or night.''</p>
        <p>The courses, given by Apex Learning, an online service that specializes in advanced placement instruction, will include online textbooks, lessons, class discussions and chat rooms among students from throughout the country.</p>
        <p>''I'm glad I have this opportunity to try something new that may be beneficial,'' Jonathan said, ''but I'm apprehensive that the material won't correlate with what is taught in school. All I can do us wait and hope for the best.''</p>
        <p>The district has agreed to finance the two courses, at a cost of $395 each, which Ms. Brett said is far less than the cost of the tutors who were assigned for two hours per course every week at a cost of $50 an hour.</p>
        <p>Online courses are also reaching college campuses on the Island. At SUNY-Stony Brook, the number of E-courses is growing steadily, said Rob Kelly, associate chairman of the computer science department.</p>
        <p>''The whole area is still in the experimental stage,'' he said, ''and no one at any university is sure yet how to teach courses online and what works best.''</p>
        <p>Different models for online courses have been developed, Mr. Kelly said. Some instructors have videotaped their classes, while other courses include chat sessions in which students ask questions online and faculty members respond. There are also online readings and quizzes.</p>
        <p>''One of the major advantages of online courses is convenience,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''particularly for students who are not always physically present on campus. We're trying to determine what student population this type of learning most appeals to.''</p>
        <p>An experimental 30-credit masters program at SUNY Stony Brook in systems management now offers a combination of on-site courses and distance learning.</p>
        <p>Joanne English Daly, an educational computing professor at the university, said that for this population of students, most of whom are full-time teachers, the program alleviates scheduling problems. Last spring the university also introduced several undergraduate courses that combine on-site classes with online discussions and tutorials.</p>
        <p>''Recent feedback from students has told us that they love it,'' Ms. Daly said. ''It offers them flexibility in scheduling and they don't have to worry about the parking problem on campus. Many of the students began their online courses with limited Internet experience, but we helped them get over their anxiety, and by the end of the semester they were technologically savvy. They also developed a sense of community with one another, and some who met online discovered that they live near each other and ended up getting together socially.''</p>
        <p>At Suffolk Community College, online courses became part of the curriculum last spring. Online enrollment for this semester is about 100, and is expected to jump to 350 by the spring, said Eric Ricioppo, a college spokesman.</p>
        <p>A proposed joint online undergraduate degree program between Suffolk Community College and SUNY-Stony Brook is now waiting for approval. If granted, the program will offer students the ability to complete two years of course work at Suffolk, then to finish a bachelors' degree at Stony Brook, with almost all courses offered online.</p>
        <p>Along with the enthusiasm for E-learning comes skepticism from some educators. Distance learning presents many serious questions and concerns, said Herman Berliner, the Hofstra University provost.</p>
        <p>''The real issue is how do we maintain highly personalized education, with continuous student-faculty interaction, in a distance learning framework?'' he said. ''We will not offer courses online just for the sake of offering them; that will be no more than fancy correspondence courses.</p>
        <p>''Technology is used in almost every course at the university,'' Dr. Berliner said. ''But it's never a substitute for excellence in teaching. It's not just the dazzle of technology but the use of faculty in addition to the technology that maximizes the student experience. To achieve that balance is a tougher challenge.''</p>
