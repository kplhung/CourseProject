        <p>TRAVEL posters depicting sun-baked stone castles and obelisks of the ancient holy city of Axum decorate the walls. Nearby are shelves of books that include histories of Ethiopia and the United States, symbolizing the former and new lives of a growing immigrant group in the city.</p>
        <p>The posters and books can be seen in the Tigrai Self-Help Ethiopian Center an organization run by Ethiopian immigrants out of a storefront on LaSalle Street to help one another with life in their new country. The name Tigrai refers to the northernmost province of Ethiopia, which borders Eritrea.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of Ethiopians here, and it's very difficult in the city if you don't have a support center,'' said Mekonnan Abraha, an elegant man with a gentle, lilting voice who helped found and helps run the center.</p>
        <p>The number of Ethiopian immigrants in the city doubled from 1990 to 1998 to about 2,200, according to the City Planning Office. Mr. Abraha said many of them dropped by the center after work or after services at nearby Riverside Church to grab a cup of coffee or to catch up.</p>
        <p>''We've been here for some time, but there are people who have not reached their potential because of lack of information,'' Mr. Abraha said of Ethiopian immigrants in New York, who often work as taxi drivers when they first arrive.</p>
        <p>To help remedy that lack, volunteers at the center dispense advice about jobs and education. The center also sponsors seminars on subjects ranging from the history of Ethiopia's ancient Axumite civilization to finding housing in New York.</p>
        <p>On a recent Sunday afternoon, about 20 people gathered at the center for a seminar on health. The men clasped one another's hands and pressed their cheeks against those of the women. The group settled into a circle on folding chairs and couches.</p>
        <p>Kidane Assefa, a resident at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center, spoke to the group in a mix of English and Tigrinya about the health dangers Ethiopian immigrants faced in their new country. Diabetes, high-blood pressure and glaucoma are common ailments that befall immigrants unused to a high-fat, high-sugar American diet and more sedentary way of life.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to give up your identity,'' Dr. Assefa said. ''But there are certain things you can improve.'' He pointed out a man in the audience with a large Afro and told the others that each time he saw this man, he told him, ''Kidane, have a haircut.''</p>
