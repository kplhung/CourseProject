        <p>The silver foil covering the cork on Kip Bedell's 1996 chardonnay suggests its quicksilver use at the table.</p>
        <p>Simple in character, and in price ($10), this chardonnay is made to order for simple fish and chicken dishes, for pork and for veal.</p>
        <p>But not for an aperitif. The 1996 growing season was cool and damp, ripening was difficult, and acids were high. Even though Mr. Bedell put this white through a secondary fermentation to reduce the acidity, it is so brisk it needs food as a complement.</p>
        <p>Likewise, another, younger North Fork chardonnay, the Schneider Vineyards '98, is also a useful dinner companion.</p>
        <p>Both wines are light-bodied, lean and refreshing, with not a smidgen of California plumpness; both pique the appetite in a tart Granny Smith way.</p>
        <p>Unless I misperceive their structures, both are a year away from their fullest development, although the Bedell, particularly in its brushed-gold color, has begun to display the patina of age.</p>
        <p>If you serve the wines cold, they may come across as harsh and near-tasteless, but if they are mildly cool, even verging on tepid, the flavors come alive.</p>
        <p>As the delicately oaky Bedell chardonnay warms up, tones of honey become honey-butterscotch and carry over into a longish finish.</p>
        <p>The pale-colored Schneider chardonnay ($19), also with honey in its aroma (and apple blossoms, too), offers a spiciness and smokiness as it warms up. Right now, the extended finish is tasty. But overall, the wine is so closed or inward -- tight, in wine jargon -- that it counsels consumer patience.</p>
        <p>Schneider, currently developing an estate in Riverhead, contracted with Palmer, in Aquebogue, to make this chardonnay from purchased grapes.</p>
