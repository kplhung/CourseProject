        <p>Re ''Political Tongue Twisters,'' by Bob Herbert (column, Aug. 28):</p>
        <p>If elected as president, and dealing with foreign heads of state and officials, George W. Bush would have to make himself perfectly clear. Foreigners expect an educated person speaking in his native language to know the meaning of the words he uses and would translate his words literally. While Americans understand the gaffe of saying ''hold this nation hostile'' for ''hold this nation hostage'' and shrug it off, foreign leaders might be confused.</p>

        <p>With a record of such substitutions as ''preserve'' for ''persevere'' (as in ''I appreciate preservation. This is what you do when you run for president. You've got to preserve''), can George W. Bush be trusted to speak for America clearly and effectively?</p>
