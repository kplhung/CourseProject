        <p>THE trains might not always run on time, but Art/Place Gallery, in the Southport train station on the New York-bound side, is to all appearances a smooth running operation. It is a co-op that periodically elects new members. This year, eight artists joined the fold; it was a hefty increase bringing the membership to a still-manageable 30. Members have a one-person show once every three years. Some of the most interesting offerings of the gallery, however, are the kind of show that's up now, a sampling titled simply, ''Eight New Members.''</p>
        <p>It happens that all the new members are women, and although a viewer might want to attempt to discover distinctly female themes and techniques, this show is a reminder that art does not innately have gender.</p>

        <p>THE trains might not always run on time, but Art/Place Gallery, in the Southport train station on the New York-bound side, is to all appearances a smooth running operation. It is a co-op that periodically elects new members. This year, eight artists joined the fold; it was a hefty increase bringing the membership to a still-manageable 30. Members have a one-person show once every three years. Some of the most interesting offerings of the gallery, however, are the kind of show that's up now, a sampling titled simply, ''Eight New Members.''</p>
        <p>It happens that all the new members are women, and although a viewer might want to attempt to discover distinctly female themes and techniques, this show is a reminder that art does not innately have gender.</p>
        <p>Three deft watercolors by Kimberly Meuse, of Stratford, delineate the good life. The artist likes to set up complex arrangements of domestic objects, albeit classy ones: silver teapots, delftware with its stunning blue, and often flowers as a natural counterpart of the manufactured items. Ms. Meuse doesn't like to leave empty spaces; her paintings are dense patterns but she especially likes to paint reflections such as hydrangea mirrored in a teapot. A love of reflection aligns the artist in a way with ''Photo Realism'' in which reflection is often a tour de force.  Though they are crowded, Ms. Meuse's compositions breathe.</p>
        <p>Margot Bittenbender is also drawn to nature, but her rather stark black and white intaglio prints, though they ostensibly present nature rather calmly, emphasize natural energy and tireless primal forces. ''Tulips'' is especially illustrative of this. Tulips as much as any flower symbolize a kind of hedonism, but Ms. Bittenbender with her love of chiaroscuro effects and rampant line, makes a trio of tulips, mysterious as if they had been drawn by Edward Gorey. Because the linear feistiness of her ''Roots'' is set below ground, this print is more purely elemental.</p>
        <p>It was a smart decision to hang the large charcoal drawings by Tina Blackburn, of Weston, near Ms. Bittenbender's prints because they extend the forceful mixture of plain black and white. But Ms. Blackburn's medium is charcoal on large sheets of paper; the actual drawing only covers a discrete part of each sheet. Her lines are short and whiplash-like and coalesce to form strong shapes. A drawing featuring a black shape on white paper is called ''Fissure'' and the long form looks something like a scar with stitches. Its opposite is ''Emergent''; for this, Ms. Blackburn has blackened the paper with charcoal and eked out a shape by using an eraser.</p>
        <p>There is one sculptor among the initiates, Susanne Andover Keany, of Weston. She might be a moonlighting as a sculptor because her short biographical statement in the press release says that she is a painter of seashells. Her sculptures are rather like paintings on sticks: she has bound together natural elements such as wood, grass, bark and shells to form small nodules on top of iron rods. An exception is the ambitious ''From the Forest,'' in which a segment of paper-thin bark seems to be unrolling like a scroll.</p>
        <p>Nature is a thread running through most of the works, and this should hardly be news. But Marilee O'Gorman Reilly, of Norwalk, perhaps ventures farthest into the world of nature in handsome encaustic paintings with the moon as subject. Encaustic means wax and one wonders if the artist is thinking of the waxing of the moon. As it is, Ms. Reilly's moons are quick circles in thick paint, often made in the same color as the background, so they are barely perceptible. This is proper for the mysterious satellite. One painting is a diptych, another has three panels. And on each panel, under the lunar image, is an abstract grid of dots: it has the look of a language and is a reminder of humankind's age-old pursuit of interpreting the moon.</p>
        <p>Tina Rohrer, of Pound Ridge, N.Y., is represented by only one work but it is large scale and tackles one of nature's larger manifestations, the ocean. Ms. Rohrer embraces geometry and deliberately denies the fluid qualities of the deep in a work entitled ''An Area of the Atlantic.'' It is composed of 13 squares, each featuring a smaller square of blue of graduated tones. A kind of precision is operating, as if the artist were doing some sort of mapping. But the uneven number of squares allows her to place them somewhat jauntily, which adds genuine life to an essentially cerebral work.</p>
        <p>The paintings by Cate M. Leach, of Darien, are related to Ms. Rohrer's opus in that they are primarily a watery blue structured by geometry. But Ms. Leach's work depends on subtlety; in one of them a landscape appears -- or does it? Ultimately the viewer accepts that they are akin to Surrealism.</p>
        <p>Barbara Harder, of New Haven, makes giant monoprints on what is described as a giant press. The elements, which might be manageable collage forms in smaller works, look like obdurate slabs here. Each print is a wealth of overlapping shapes with stone-like textures densely filling the paper. These prints are not just made, they're built and their ambition might be an auspicious symbol for the whole gallery.</p>
        <p>The exhibition ''Eight New Members'' is at Art/Place in the Southport train station through Sept. 10.</p>
