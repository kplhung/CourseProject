        <p>IF the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich had ended on its 10th day, it would have been remembered for Olga Korbut's pixieish dance along the balance beam or Mark Spitz's record run of seven gold medals in swimming. These were to be the Games of peace and camaraderie -- a democratic West Germany's rebuke to Nazism and to Adolf Hitler's fraudulent quest to use the 1936 Berlin Summer Games as a showcase for Aryan physical superiority.</p>
        <p>But before dawn on the 11th day, Sept. 5, eight Palestinian guerrillas scaled an unguarded fence in the Olympic village and invaded the apartment building housing the Israeli team. They took 11 athletes and officials hostage and, over the course of a slow-motion 20-hour siege that riveted the world, killed them all.</p>
        <p>If any innocence remained at the Olympics, it ended that day, with the fedayeen, whose hooded faces came to symbolize terrorism, and the preternaturally calm leader, Issa, with his blue suit and white hat, his face blackened by shoe polish, negotiating with a grenade in his hand while untold millions watched on television.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the Germans had chosen pacifism over security, policing the Olympic village with 2,000 unarmed guards. ''Their whole mind-set was on being non-militaristic,'' said Jim McKay, who anchored the ABC Sports coverage, which earned him a news Emmy Award. ''They were supposed to be the serene Olympics.''</p>
        <p>Of the eight Black September terrorists, only one, Jamal al-Gashey, a teenager at the time, survives. Five were killed during the bungled firefight with untrained German snipers at a military airport that ended the siege. Three others, including Mr. al-Gashey, were jailed, but they were released in late October 1972 in exchange for the freedom of a Lufthansa jet that had been hijacked by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, another guerrilla group. The Mossad, Israel's secret service, eventually killed two of the three.</p>
        <p>Now, as the Summer Games from Sydney approach, we see Mr. al-Gashey, who has eluded his Israeli hunters, in middle age, his face obscured in shadows and distorted by grainy video, wearing a ball cap, denim shirt, eyeglasses and a mustache and smoking a cigarette.</p>
        <p>Twenty-eight years older, he is onscreen in ''One Day in September,'' a documentary in which he describes his life as a Palestinian refugee and his pride in what the Black September terrorists did to the Israelis inside the Olympic village at 31 Connolly strasse.</p>
        <p>The first image of this long-wanted man is of his clasped hands. Then comes his voice, calm and measured, which offers no regrets.</p>
        <p>''I am a member of a Palestinian family which fled our village in Galilee from Zionist gangs in 1948,'' he says through a translator. In the liberation movement he was given a gun, he says, and ''for the first time in my life, I felt inspired, I felt truly Palestinian, that I wasn't a wretched refugee.'' Later in the film he adds: ''Before Munich, the world had no idea about our struggle, but on that day, the name of 'Palestine' was repeated all over the world.''</p>
        <p>For the makers of ''One Day in September,'' which won the Academy Award for best documentary last March and will be seen on Sept. 11 at 8 p.m. on HBO, finding Mr. al-Gashey was crucial: the film would have been made without him, but no one else could describe the terrorists' training in Libya, their arriving in Munich with no idea of the plan, their watching volleyball at the Olympic Park on the day before they broke into the Israelis' dormitory. ''I felt very proud,'' Mr. al-Gashey says, ''that for the first time I was finally able to confront the Israelis.''</p>
        <p>ARTHUR COHN, the co-producer of the $2.5 million film and a winner of five previous Oscars, said: ''He was our guarantor of even-handedness in the film. I don't think I would have made the film with as big a budget if I didn't have Jamal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohn and the director, Kevin Macdonald, would not disclose where Mr. al-Gashey lives other than to say that he was interviewed in Africa and moves frequently to protect himself, his wife and two children.</p>
        <p>''It was a series of coincidences and fortuitous circumstances that led us to find someone who knew him and would act as a go-between,'' Mr. Macdonald said. ''It was a kind of six degrees of separation situation, where somebody knew somebody who knew somebody. I had heard that one of the Palestinians was still alive and that a Palestinian reporter had tried to interview him a couple of years before, but it didn't work out. That started me to thinking. So after eight months, we got him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. al-Gashey hovers over the documentary, a haunting yet oddly congenial presence. The film is structured like a suspense story: jump-cut editing gives the illusion of accelerated action, and recreations show how the terrorists entered the Israeli residence and how one Israeli, Gad Zabari, escaped. The background music is by Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Philip Glass -- not the classical selections that might be expected for such a dour story.</p>
        <p>The film was completed last October, in time to meet the deadline to be seen by the documentary panel of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but before Mr. Cohn had made a distribution deal. Once it became a finalist, the documentary was screened by the academy, the American Film Institute and the Simon Wiesenthal Center. The four other finalists, including ''The Buena Vista Social Club,'' had all been released theatrically.</p>
        <p>''I must have had 100 conversations with Arthur,'' said Sheila Nevins, the executive vice president of original programming for HBO, who acquired the documentary for $1 million before it won the Academy Award.</p>
        <p>''He kept asking, 'What about 'Buena Vista,' what do you hear?' I'd say, 'Nothing.' I think Arthur was a little insecure until after he won. I saw him at intermission of the Oscars, racing around thrilled. He pushed hard to win, he politicked, he screamed.''</p>
        <p>Regarding the events in Munich, Ms. Nevins added: ''I was awake and alive at the time, but I didn't really recognize the magnitude of the event. Somehow I glossed over it as a precursor to what terrorism would become. I was so astounded by my ignorance.''</p>
        <p>The film does not detail a half-century of Palestinian-Israeli conflicts, as the Palestinian-born writer Edward W. Said insisted it should have in The Guardian of London; it focuses its narrative on a day when the West Germans, confounding anyone who expected efficiency and military precision from them, proved  incompetent in their negotiations with the terrorists and their attempts to rescue the Israelis.</p>
        <p>''We were, I think, a little bit naive, you know,'' Brigadier Gen. Ulrich Wegener, then an aide to Hans-Dietrich Genscher, West Germany's interior minister, says in the film. Mr. Genscher offered himself in exchange for the Israelis. Manfred Schreiber, Munich's police chief, offered money.</p>
        <p>Mr. al-Gashey is the only Palestinian voice, albeit a powerful one, in the film. Mr. Macdonald uses him as counterpoint to the Israeli side, especially to the love story of Andre Spitzer, the affable Israeli fencing coach who was killed by the terrorists, and his Dutch wife, Ankie. Their brief life together is the film's emotional anchor. There is 8-millimeter footage of their modest wedding; there are moments in which Ankie expresses fear for Andre's safety and frustration with conflicting news reports about his fate, and there is a visit by their grown daughter, Anouk, to her father's grave in Israel, which ends the film.</p>
        <p>''It was only a year and three months that I was married to Andre Spitzer,'' says Ankie Spitzer. ''But I remember that year as the most beautiful and wonderful year of my life.''</p>
        <p>After the film's theatrical release in Israel, several of the slain Israelis' families objected publicly to the use of the most graphic police photographs of the bloodied and tortured bodies of Joseph Romano, a weight lifter, and Moshe Weinberg, a wrestling coach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohn and Mr. Macdonald blurred the images. ''But I did it reluctantly,'' Mr. Cohn said. ''You can't do a film about terrorism without showing terror.''</p>
        <p>As cooperative as Mr. al-Gashey and some of the Israelis were, Mr. Cohn encoutered considerable resistance from German officials.</p>
        <p>''I had so much trouble getting Genscher and Schreiber to talk,'' Mr. Cohn said. ''I went to Genscher, who is very decent, noble and intelligent, and said, 'Dr. Genscher, you must appear, so it doesn't look like you're hiding.' '' Eventually, Mr. Genscher, Mr. Schreiber and the remaining Germans consented, but their memories serve only to underscore their failures, from not having a trained anti-terrorist squad to not equipping the untrained group of five police snipers at the airport with walkie-talkies. Had the snipers been carrying them, they would have learned that they would be facing eight terrorists, not five, as the German authorities initially believed.</p>
        <p>With unconcealed contempt, Zvi Zamir, who then headed the Mossad, disdains the Germans' handling of the crisis and their not letting him bring a trained rescue team from Israel.</p>
        <p>''They weren't capable,'' he says. At least one of the airport snipers was too far away to spot the terrorists in his gun sight. ''Unbelievable,'' Mr. Zamir says with simmering anger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Macdonald said that one reason to make the film was to create a ''public outcry'' that would force German and Bavarian state authorities to release all the files about the handling of the massacre, a goal that has eluded the Israeli families in years of court challenges.</p>
        <p>''They've shoved rotten fish under the carpet for 28 years, and as the years go by, it stinks even more,'' he said. ''They've exacerbated it so it looks like some kind of conspiracy.''</p>
        <p>One conspiracy theory the film advances, but fails to prove, is that German officials helped plan the Lufthansa hijacking to rid themselves of the three Olympic terrorists and keep further attacks off German turf. ''The entire affair,'' the narrator Michael Douglas says, without offering any evidence, ''was a set-up, organized by the German government in collusion with the terrorists.''</p>
        <p>Why else, the film suggests, did the plane have only 12 passengers, and no women and children? Why else, it asks, would the Germans make the deal with such ''indecent haste'' and without consultation with Israel? That the government of Chancellor Willy Brandt capitulated to the hijackers' demands is undeniable. General Wegener says as much in the film, as does the former mayor of Munich. But no one offers proof that Brandt's government helped plan the hijacking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Macdonald said that in an off-camera interview, Abu Daoud, the longtime Palestinian leader who admits in his memoir to helping plan the Olympic massacre, described a German-Palestinian conspiracy. So did another Palestinian source.</p>
        <p>''But Daoud is not altogether reliable,'' said Mr. Macdonald, who added that he nonetheless felt bound to suggest that something wrong had occurred.</p>
        <p>''All I'm saying is, this is as much as I know,' he said. ''I think there's a fair likelihood that it happened.''</p>
