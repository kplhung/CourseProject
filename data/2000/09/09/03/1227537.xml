        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Although it's been reduced to just one day this year, Friends of the Arts' Beethoven Festival 2000 still carries a lot of musical punch.

        <p>Behind the Scenes</p>
        <p>Before the National Park Service began managing the William Floyd Estate in 1975, eight generations of Floyds lived on the property in Mastic. And from the 1720's to the 1970's, the family amassed a lot of stuff that is now parceled out into distinct collections: 25,000 paintings, artifacts and pieces of clothing in the Historic Collection; more than 130,000 documents, including bills, letters and school notebooks, in the Archival Collection, and 25,000 objects recovered in six different projects in the Archeological Collection. While 5,000 of these items can be seen in the 25 furnished rooms in the mansion, the others -- 97 percent of the collection -- are packed away at the Curatorial Storage Facility, which the park service is opening to the public on Friday and again on Sept. 15 and Oct. 14. The free 90-minute tours start at 10 a.m. Reservations: (631) 399-2030.</p>
        <p>Heading Southward</p>
        <p>With birds beginning to leave cold climates for warmer winter homes,  walks for beginners and experienced birders alike will be held on Saturday. The first walk, from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. in East Norwich at the Muttontown Preserve off Route 25A,  will take participants through fields and woodlands to observe the migrants as they fly by and to watch a bird bander at work (516) 571-8500. For the second walk, members of the Huntington Audubon Society will lead a trip to the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge. Participants should gather at 8 a.m. at the Gerard Street parking lot (516) 433-5590. For the third walk, guides from the North Shore Audubon Society will take beginners on a two-and-a-half-hour field trip through Coffin Woods on Oyster Bay Road in Locust Valley. Participants should meet at 9:30 a.m. in the parking lot (516) 676-2136.</p>
        <p>But Does He Sing?</p>
        <p>The artist Larry Rivers has been known to play the saxophone from time to time. He and his jazz band will appear with his jazz band at 8 p.m. Saturday at a cabaret night at the Heckscher Museum of Art on Prime Avenue in Huntington. David Lehman will read from -- and, of course, sign -- his new book of poems, ''The Daily Mirror,'' which has a cover designed by Mr. Rivers.  Wine and cheese will be served in the  galleries that currently house two shows, ''Hans Namuth: Portraits'' and ''Pollock to Wyeth: American Masters.'' Both feature pictures of or by Mr. Rivers. (631) 351-3250.</p>
        <p>Not That 'Phantom' . . .</p>
        <p>For its first production of the new season, the Gray Wig, Hofstra University's Alumni Repertory Theater, will present ''Phantom,'' a retelling of tale of the phantom of the opera with music and lyrics by Maury Yeston and book by Arthur Kopit. It opens Friday at the John Adams Playhouse on the Hofstra campus in Hempstead and runs through Sept. 24. (516) 463-6644.</p>
        <p>. . . But That Lillian Russell</p>
        <p>For its final production in the ''2000 Biographies on Stage'' series, Deepwells Farm in St. James will stage an imaginary meeting of Lillian Russell, the legendary turn-of-the-century musical-comedy star, with Augusta Gaynor and her maid. Mrs. Gaynor was the wife of the William J. Gaynor, the mayor of New York from 1910 to 1913, and the  Gaynors lived at Deepwells while he was mayor. The audience will get a traditional tea -- yes, finger sandwiches and pastries, too -- along with all the gossip of the day. The production will be presented at 1:30 p.m. Thursday through Saturday and at 4 p.m. Sunday through Oct. 15 at the Deepwells Farm County Park on Route 25A. (516) 862-6080.</p>
        <p>Historic Regatta</p>
        <p>In an age of specialization, it's probably no surprise that there are sailors who only like to sail boats of a certain age. Twenty of these skippers will take to the waters between Sag Harbor and Greenport on Saturday in a Historic Seaport Regatta sponsored by the East End Seaport Museum and Marine Foundation and the Eastern Long Island Sailing Association. The boats, including a 1927 Spindrift, will leave Sag Harbor at 11 a.m. and depending upon the wind, should start approaching Claudio's Dock in Greenport around 3 p.m. (631) 477-0004.</p>
        <p>Super Sports</p>
        <p>Done any swimming, biking or running lately? All in a single day, racing the clock and other competitors? If the answer is yes, then you have a choice of two triathlons on Saturday on both ends of Long Island. In Point Lookout, the 17th annual triathlon will start at 7:30 a.m. at  Hempstead Town Park (516) 292-9000, ext. 219. In Sag Harbor, at Long Beach, the Mighty Hamptons Triathlon, benefiting Southampton Hospital, will also start at 7:30 a.m. (631) 283-7400.</p>
        <p>Free Choices</p>
        <p>TODAY -- The Back to School Festival, with family activities like face-painting, games and environmental programs, continues today from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Nissequogue River State Park in Kings Park. While the festival is free, it costs $5 a car to enter the park (631) 269-4927.</p>
        <p>SATURDAY -- Jerry Stiller, the actor and comedian, has written a book, ''Married to Laughter: A Love Story Featuring Anne Meara.'' He will sign copies at 8 p.m. at the Book Revue on New York Avenue in Huntington. (631) 271-1442.</p>
