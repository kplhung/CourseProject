        <p>A taste among Civil War re-enactors for total authenticity, combined with the power of the Internet, has given James F. Pierotti, owner of a baking company in Milton, Mass., a new market. Founded in 1801, his G. H. Bent Company supplied Union soldiers with hardtack crackers.  Thick squares made from flour and water, the crackers are tasteless and hard as rocks, acknowledged Mr. Pierotti, whose family assumed ownership in 1944. ''There wasn't much demand for hardtack after the turn of the century,'' he said, so the company quit making it.</p>
        <p>But 20 years ago, a historian at Old Sturbridge Village, a recreated 19th-century town in central Massachusetts, told him of Bent's historical role. Mr. Pierotti resumed hardtack production, ''as sort of a novelty thing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1999, Bent sold just 120 boxes, which cost $8 each. That was before Bent started its www.hardtackcracker.com Web site last December. The re-enactors, 50,000 and rapidly growing, soon posted links to it on their Internet bulletin boards; the Bent site has received 175,000 hits so far this year. ''Civil War re-enactors are really Internet-savvy,'' Mr. Pierotti said. ''It's how they tell each other about upcoming events and where to get gear.''</p>
        <p>The bottom line? He has sold 4,000 boxes of hardtack, $8 each, this year. And what is the historically correct way to consume it? ''Fried in pork fat and dipped in coffee,'' Mr. Pierotti said.</p>
