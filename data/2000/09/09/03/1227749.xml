      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Susan Mayer and Christopher Jencks, educators, says recent stabs at school accountability rely entirely on standardized tests, but test scores should not be only measure of success; says economists have shown that test scores account for no more than $1,500 of the $5,000 difference in wages between high school graduates and dropouts; says simply staying in school, regardless of test scores, changes people in ways that employers value; says denying diplomas to high school students who fail standardized test may backfire, increasing odds that students with very low scores will drop out</p>

        <p>''Accountability'' has become the favored solution to the nation's educational problems. For schools, accountability usually means that standardized tests identify failing schools, which then become candidates for administrative shakeups, closure or voucher programs.</p>
        <p>For students, accountability typically means requiring anyone with low test scores to attend summer school. Students whose scores do not improve may have to repeat a grade. Some states plan to withhold high school diplomas from low scorers, although that threat may be politically difficult to carry out.</p>

        <p>''Accountability'' has become the favored solution to the nation's educational problems. For schools, accountability usually means that standardized tests identify failing schools, which then become candidates for administrative shakeups, closure or voucher programs.</p>
        <p>For students, accountability typically means requiring anyone with low test scores to attend summer school. Students whose scores do not improve may have to repeat a grade. Some states plan to withhold high school diplomas from low scorers, although that threat may be politically difficult to carry out.</p>
        <p>These stabs at accountability rely entirely on standardized tests, which seem like a reasonable measure. After all, if students aren't learning, something is wrong. But test scores should not be the only measure of success.</p>
        <p>Contrary to what many assume, students can benefit from attending school even when their test scores do not improve. Among men and women in their late 20's who worked full time throughout 1998, those with high school diplomas but no post-secondary education typically earned $5,000 more than high school dropouts.</p>
        <p>Sounds good. But test scores have little to do with this difference in wages. Numerous economists have shown that test scores, on average, account for no more than $1,500 of the $5,000 difference between high school graduates and dropouts.</p>
        <p>Of course, book learning is not useless. Students who do well on tests tend to make more money than those who don't. But test scores are only one factor among many that affect wages, and simply staying in school, regardless of test scores, changes people in ways that employers value.</p>
        <p>We social scientists do not know what specifically accounts for the wage gap between high school graduates and dropouts. But if employers are asked why graduates make better workers than dropouts, they give a multitude of answers: Graduates have a better attitude; they are more responsible; they have better people skills.</p>
        <p>There is also evidence that when schools change these character traits, the result is long-lasting.</p>
        <p>Model preschool programs almost always raise children's test scores, but after a few years the advantage fades. Yet in the long run, students who attend good preschools have fewer behavioral problems and are less likely to be placed in special education classes, less likely to drop out of high school and less likely to become teenage mothers.</p>
        <p>Because schooling helps students in many ways, measuring performance solely through test scores can do harm as well as good. If teachers know that their school may be closed unless scores rise, they may not spend much time trying to make students more considerate, trustworthy or respectful.</p>
        <p>Likewise, denying diplomas to high school students who fail a standardized test may backfire. A recent national study by Brian Jacob, a doctoral student at the University of Chicago, shows that high-stakes testing increases the odds that students with very low scores will drop out.</p>
        <p>So how should we measure school performance? While some schools create a climate in which students learn to show up, hand in their homework and meet their other obligations, others do not.</p>
        <p>We need to take such differences into account. We should ask not just whether a school imparts knowledge, but also how many students stick around until graduation and how many complete college applications. We should assess how students behave by asking how many students come to school with guns and how many have babies before graduating.</p>
        <p>Woody Allen famously quipped that 90 percent of life is showing up. Students who finish high school do better than dropouts partly because they have learned this lesson.</p>
