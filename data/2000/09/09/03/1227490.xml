        <p>To the Editor: With more than 570,300 square miles of land mass, Alaska is about one-fifth the size of the continental United States. These facts add perspective to Timothy Egan's story, ''A Land So Wild, It's Getting Crowded'' (Aug. 20).</p>
        <p>While there are powerful outside interests that would like to see our state turned into a national park, Alaska is far from becoming ''Disneyfied.'' These organized groups fail to recognize the economic needs of the state's 615,000 residents, many of whom are dependent on tourism to sustain their families.</p>

        <p>Accessible only by air and sea, Juneau, Alaska's capital city, is proud of its long-standing tradition of welcoming visitors. Historic downtown Juneau is a port -- not a park -- that has served as the heart of commerce for more than a century. America's last frontier has something for everyone and ample room to grow.</p>
