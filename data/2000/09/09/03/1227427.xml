        <p>The images are almost unbearably repulsive -- charred human remains lying in coals, naked corpses dangling from the end of ropes slung over trees, bare-footed men hanging in groups, grotesquely mutilated bodies tied to poles. But what is most shocking is the crowds of perpetrators and witnesses -- many of them children -- posing casually without masks or shame, even smiling, next to the victims. ''Between 1882 and 1968, an estimated 4,742 blacks met their deaths at the hands of lynch mobs,'' the historian Leon F. Litwack writes in WITHOUT SANCTUARY: Lynching Photography in America (Twin Palms, $60), a harrowing record of racism and savagery drawn from the Allen-Littlefield Collection at the Robert W. Woodruff Library at Emory University. The photographs were taken between 1883 and 1960, and nearly all originally appeared on postcards, some with handwritten messages like, ''This is the barbecue we had last night,'' which was scrawled on the back of a card showing a burned torso dangling from a pole. Not blacks alone were killed: one postcard showing two Italian immigrants hanged in 1910 carries the inscription, ''Labor agitators lynched during the cigar makers' strike, Tampa Fla.'' Mob justice was carried out against men, women and entire families, in a kind of participatory public theater that featured picnicking, trophy collecting and ''excursion'' trains that brought in spectators. Litwack makes the troubling suggestion that the culprits and observers were not monstrous aberrations but more or less common people united in their fear and hatred of blacks and determined to protect their way of life against an outside threat. ''The photographs stretch our credulity, even numb our minds and senses to the full extent of the horror,'' Litwack writes, ''but they must be examined if we are to understand how normal men and women could live with, participate in and defend such atrocities, even reinterpret them so they would not see themselves or be perceived as less than civilized.''</p>
