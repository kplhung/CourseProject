        <p>Fences and Neighbors</p>
        <p>Q: What is the history of the property at 5 East 95th Street? What is the vintage ironwork on the top of the white brick building there, and why does the adjacent building at 7 East 95th have a garden fence along the side? . . . Samuel G. White, Buttrick White &amp; Burtis Architects, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A: The lots at 3, 5 and 7 East 95th Street are remnants of a partly successful plan in the 1910's to create a new Social Register enclave of town houses. The first to build was Marion B. Carhart, the widow of Amory S. Carhart, a banking and railroad entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carhart hired the architect Horace Trumbauer in 1913 to put up a grand limestone house at 3 East 95th Street; the next year Edith and Ernesto Fabbri started the majestic Tuscan-style house at 7 East 95th Street, designed by Grosvenor Atterbury.</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Fabbri -- the granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt -- bought her plot at 7 East 95th in 1912, it also included the land at 5 East 95th Street. She sold the site of 5 East 95th in 1914 to the architect Goodhue Livingston, a partner in Trowbridge &amp; Livingston, which designed the St. Regis Hotel. An article in The New York Sun in March 1914 said that he would finish a house on the site within the year, and that the Fabbris' front yard would ''probably be planted with flowers.''</p>
        <p>The New York Mail also remarked on this ''newly formed private house colony,'' and the Real Estate Record and Guide noted that Mrs. Carhart and her neighbors bought up empty land on the south side of 95th Street -- apparently the site of the present 4 East 95th Street -- to try to prevent construction of an apartment house. (The apartment house now at 4 East 95th was built in the 1920's.)</p>
        <p>In 1914 the Fabbris made an agreement with Livingston to leave part of their front yard -- according to a deed restriction -- ''unbuilt upon to furnish light and air and prospect'' to the buildings.</p>
        <p>To enclose the open space, the Fabbris ran the present limestone and iron fence down their side of the property line; original drawings for the house show a driveway area with an automobile turntable -- a revolving turntable to switch the car's direction -- surrounded by plantings.</p>
        <p>It is one thing to build a house, another to build a neighborhood; just at this time, Ogden Codman, a decorator and architect, was trying to launch a similar colony around his own 1913 town house at 7 East 96th Street, but his effort faltered. For whatever reason, Livingston remained in his own house at 38 East 65th Street and never built on his 95th Street land. A photograph of the Fabbri house in 1917 shows Livingston's land improved only with a plain picket fence.</p>
        <p>Goodhue held the vacant land at 5 East 95th Street until 1928, when he sold it to Mabel Drury, a granddaughter of Elbridge Gerry, the philanthropist who founded the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Drury had bought the old Carhart house at 3 East 95th Street for her own occupancy, and in 1929 her architects, John B. Snook &amp; Sons, filed plans for a ''garden plot'' at 5 East 95th Street.</p>
        <p>To judge from old photographs, this included an elegant but wildly menacing spiked iron fence along the street wall, up to the Fabbris' fence.</p>
        <p>In 1937 the Drury family sold both the Carhart house and its garden plot to the Lycee Francais, a private school; in 1949 Edith Fabbri created an Episcopal retreat, the House of the Redeemer, to which she donated her house.</p>
        <p>In 1957 the Lycee's architect, Henri Durieux, designed the present simple modern building at 5 East 95th Street, on the site of the garden; Durieux's original drawings for the building call for a ''woven wire fence'' at the parapet of the new building. But at some point in construction the decision was made to salvage Mrs. Drury's fence and reuse it on the new building, where it forms a piquant and curious contrast to the plain white brick below.</p>
        <p>The Lycee Francais is selling the buildings at 3 and 5 East 95th, as well as its four other Upper East Side buildings, and plans to put up a new building at an as-yet-undetermined site.</p>
        <p>A Spiral Staircase</p>
        <p>Q: On the building at 62 East Fourth Street, there is a curious spiral staircase encased in metal gridwork. Is this original? Is it an early fire escape? What is the history of this structure? . . . Richard McGeehan, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A: This unusual structure was built by Victor Eckstein, who ran a restaurant at 64 East Fourth Street and lived in an old house at 62 East Fourth. In 1889, to replace his house, Eckstein had the architect Max Schroff design a combination structure with a restaurant on the basement and first floors, meeting rooms on the second and third floors, and living quarters for Eckstein on the fourth and fifth floors.</p>
        <p>The facade has large French windows on the second and third floors, strangely handled Classical detailing, and the legend ''Built 1889'' in the galvanized iron cornice above the third floor.</p>
        <p>The 1890 census shows Eckstein, his wife, Josephine, and their six children in occupancy. Later census information indicates that Eckstein was born in Germany in 1843 and came to the United States in 1868.</p>
        <p>Because of requirements at the Department of Buildings, Schroff had to provide a fire escape for the Ecksteins, so he designed a circular iron stairway leading down from a loggia on the fourth floor, screened from the outside by perforated iron mesh.</p>
        <p>In 1903 Eckstein sold the building, and by the 1910's it was described in building applications as a dance hall known as Astoria Hall. The front fire escape was later succeeded by a larger fire escape on the rear, more conventional in form.</p>
        <p>The building is now owned by the city. The Rod Rodgers Dance Company Studios leases the basement and first floor for rehearsal spaces, and performs elsewhere.  The Duo Theater, a Latino group specializing in musicals, has the second and third floors.</p>
        <p>The top two floors are empty and decrepit -- one can see daylight through the roof and walls on the top floor -- although there is still a wooden bannister and trim from the Eckstein apartment.</p>
        <p>The fourth-floor loggia leads to the circular iron staircase encased in the handsome basketweave ironwork, all of which looks to be original to the building, although altered. Circular fire stairs have long been illegal, but they now serve another purpose -- Mr. Rodgers says he can gauge his dancers' talents by how well they can descend those stairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodgers and his architects, Byrns Kendall &amp; Schieferdecker, have been working on the building for years, and recently Mr. Rodgers completed a $495,000 project rebuilding his two floors as dance rehearsal space.</p>
        <p>They look spiffy, but the exterior is a wreck, with peeling paint, rotting windows and a missing cornice.</p>
        <p>Harry Kendall, the architect in charge of the interior work for Mr. Rodgers, said that he had been asked to plan a facade overhaul that would include the unusual fire stairs,  but that financing was ''very uncertain.''</p>
