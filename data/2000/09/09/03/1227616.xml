        <p>THIS year's New Jersey Fine Arts Annual, at the Newark Museum, acknowledges the momentous time period we're in. It's called ''Into the Millennium.'' But there's little that's flashy or futuristic in it. The curators made sure that the art vehicle taking us forward is something like Noah's Ark. The sexes are both well represented, but the 14 artists also represent various ages and modes of art making.</p>
        <p>The rules for inclusion are liberal. An artist must be associated with New Jersey. This means someone who lives elsewhere but is employed in the state is eligible, as is an artist whose studio is here. Most of the artists applied to be included, but the curators, Joseph Jacobs and Fred Wilson, also handpicked several.</p>

        <p>THIS year's New Jersey Fine Arts Annual, at the Newark Museum, acknowledges the momentous time period we're in. It's called ''Into the Millennium.'' But there's little that's flashy or futuristic in it. The curators made sure that the art vehicle taking us forward is something like Noah's Ark. The sexes are both well represented, but the 14 artists also represent various ages and modes of art making.</p>
        <p>The rules for inclusion are liberal. An artist must be associated with New Jersey. This means someone who lives elsewhere but is employed in the state is eligible, as is an artist whose studio is here. Most of the artists applied to be included, but the curators, Joseph Jacobs and Fred Wilson, also handpicked several.</p>
        <p>Chief among the invited artists is Geoffrey Hendricks, who has taught at Rutgers-New Brunswick since 1956. His inclusion is like a lifetime achievement award. He made his reputation as a conceptual artist, and there is some old-fashioned Dada and Surrealism among his objects here. They're often beautiful in a classic way, as in ''Sky and Roof Slates,'' a work in which watercolors of cloud-filled blue skies alternate with obdurate slate. The work is a prime example of elevated ordinariness.</p>
        <p>Mac Adams is a photographer whose work has some of the same ethereal qualities as Mr. Hendricks's. He juxtaposes objects implausibly, and shadows have equal weight with the tangible elements. All of his works here but one are part of a series titled ''Empty Spaces,'' and within those spaces Mr. Adams indulges in a lot of fool-the-eye. In ''Empty Spaces (Rat)'' the shadow cast by a banana tied to a stone with much twine left dangling looks like a rodent.</p>
        <p>Frank Bosco achieves a different kind of eeriness by photocopying the ends of rolls of paper, some tightly wound, others looser. In the copies, the ends of the rolls look like eyes. Because Mr. Bosco meticulously strings several photocopies together, the effect is multiplied. Also related to Surrealism is the ''Sky Series'' of Claire Jervert, who enlarges images of the sky obtained from videotaping television programs. Her aim is to edify banality. The resultant paintings are beautiful.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs said that when he and Mr. Wilson first saw the slides submitted by Julius Kramer they speculated -- correctly, it turns out -- that he must be about 80, because his Abstract Expressionist paintings have the authority of someone who was present at the source. Paul Weingarten paints like a Jersey Van Gogh, enamored of smokestacks instead of cypress trees. An opposite texture is achieved by Peter Cross who makes pale graphite drawings of streamlined locomotives and elements of the landscape. Jennifer Krause's subject matter is particularly American, too. She focuses her wide paintings on the centerline of highways, making that white line hypnotic.</p>
        <p>Still out in nature, Robert Lobe puts sheets of aluminum over tree trunks and large rocks, and hammers out their surface textures and patterns. He has been doing this since the 1970's, but the work here is an advance because Mr. Lobe now arranges sections of imprinted metal to make fanciful sculpture. The other sculptor here who makes discrete pieces is Tyrone Mitchell who expertly combines diverse materials, like wood, bronze and ceramic.</p>
        <p>Some of his sculptures would feel at home in Cheryl P. Riley's installation, ''Self-Portrait: Modus Operandi for Imagination and Invention.'' Ms. Riley is predominately a furniture designer and the centerpiece of her room is a ''Dogon Chair'' that has an exaggeratedly tall back. It looks African, Chinese and European. The rest of the installation is a reverential museum-like display of smaller items, some found, some conceived as art objects, that have influenced the artist.</p>
