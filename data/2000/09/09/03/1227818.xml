        <p>The third so-called Million Youth March, a Harlem rally that two years ago exploded in violence and was the subject of a fierce legal battle in 1998 and 1999, drew only a few hundred people yesterday.</p>
        <p>The rally, organized all three years by Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the former Nation of Islam spokesman, started two hours late, at 2 p.m., and was marred by rain and  troubles with the sound system.</p>
        <p>The crowd gathered on Malcolm X Boulevard near 122nd Street, barely filling half a block. There were at least 200 people this year. Attendance was estimated at several thousand last year and 6,000 in 1998.</p>
        <p>The police would not say how many officers were at the rally, but they outnumbered participants by at least 2 to 1.</p>
        <p>The city tried to block Mr. Muhammad from holding the rally in 1998 and 1999, with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani citing Mr. Muhammad's racially charged antiwhite views.</p>
        <p>Both years the city was overruled in court, and the rally was allowed to go forward. This year the city granted the permit.</p>
        <p>In 1998, dozens of people were hurt in a melee as the police enforced the 4 p.m. deadline for the rally's end.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad blamed the low turnout yesterday on lack of media coverage, telling reporters before the event, ''I think that it is all fair in war, that the numbers be low because you know that you have not covered the march this year and you know that it was deliberate, that the white media did not touch us.'' In his remarks, Mr. Muhammad spoke of the importance of black unity and independence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Muhammad ended the rally minutes before the 4 p.m. deadline. There were no injuries or arrests, the police said.</p>
        <p>Tension rose, however, as Mr. Muhammad and some of his aides angrily confronted police officers in the street after the rally as they headed toward West 125th Street under heavy police escort. They said they wanted to march without the police.</p>
        <p>At 4:30 p.m., several hundred police officers were still standing along West 125th Street, but much of the crowd had dispersed, and Mr. Muhammad and his aides left.</p>
