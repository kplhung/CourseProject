        <p>The relationship between the Museum of Modern Art and the residents who live near its towering, grand white complex has for the last decade been one of cordial appreciation.</p>
        <p>When residents had a complaint, both sides say, the museum did its best to take their concerns into consideration. When the museum needed government approval for a zoning variance or other accommodation, its next-door neighbors often spoke up on its behalf.</p>
        <p>But the civil tone has ceased. On Wednesday, the two sides plan to go before the City Planning Commission with a dispute over the museum's plans for its largest expansion since 1984, when it undertook an $85 million project that included the construction of a condominium tower and reduced the size of a garden.</p>
        <p>Museum officials have requested changes to a portion of the Midtown zoning map that would allow them to build a movie theater, an educational wing and several new galleries. Plans also call for creating a new restaurant, adding loading docks on West 54th Street and putting another major entrance on West 53rd Street.</p>
        <p>Neighbors say the plans are not well thought out, would bring an unbearable amount of traffic to the area and would block spectacular views of the stained-glass windows of St. Thomas Church, a New York City landmark.</p>
        <p>In a matter of a few months, what had been a comfortable coexistence has become a Manhattan-style development battle, pitting the politically powerful museum in one corner and its well-to-do neighbors in another.</p>
        <p>''Of course there are prices of living in a nice part of Manhattan,'' said Michael S. Gruen, a Fifth Avenue lawyer hired by a group of residents of West 54th Street. ''But changed zoning is not necessarily one of them, especially when the requests for zoning changes come every 20 years.''</p>
        <p>For its part, the museum has not commented on the opposition publicly since it lost the latest round of the battle two weeks ago: the Manhattan Borough Board, which is made up of elected officials, refused to endorse the zoning changes. Mary Lou Strahlendorff, a spokeswoman for the museum, said a recently released environmental impact study addressed most of the residents' concerns.</p>
        <p>The study proposes an array of solutions to help speed up traffic around the museum, expand the garden on its grounds and allow light into the church, while still blocking an exterior view of the stained-glass windows. All the changes would occur on the block the museum now occupies, bounded by Fifth Avenue, the Avenue of the Americas, West 53rd Street and West 54th Street.</p>
        <p>If allowed to go forward with the expansion, the museum says, it will be able to double the number of schoolchildren it serves, bring more jobs to the community and increase the number of annual visitors to 2.5 million from 1.8 million. The museum hopes to complete the expansion, which would add 410,000 to 633,050 square feet of space, by 2004.</p>
        <p>But because of neighbors' opposition, museum officials have not been able to get the support of the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, or Councilwoman Christine Quinn, who represents the area. Ms. Quinn voted against a resolution to support the zoning changes at the board meeting; Ms. Fields abstained.</p>
        <p>Without the Planning Commission's approval, museum officials will have to go back to the drawing board. If the commission does approve the plan, it will go before the City Council for a vote. The commission is expected to act by Oct. 6, city officials said.</p>
        <p>Last week, museum officials met privately with a group of residents opposed to the plan but were unable to win them over, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gruen, the residents' lawyer, said the resilience of the opposition was easily explained: ''The museum got a sweet deal in 1984. It got an enormous condominium tower, and that's why it is flush with cash now. I am not sure it is entitled to this at the expense of its neighbors.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 6, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Sunday about plans by the Museum of Modern Art for a large expansion misstated the position of the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, toward zoning changes that would allow it. Ms. Fields supports the changes; she does not oppose them.</p>
        <p>In discussing public opposition to the project, the article also omitted the position of Community Board 5. On July 13 the board voted 27 to 3 in support, with one abstention.</p>
