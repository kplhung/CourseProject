      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Federated Conservationists of Westchester County, an environmental group based in White Plains, has sued the city of Yonkers, the county and the state in connection with a plan to build 17 units of low-income housing in Rory O'Moore Park. The housing is to be built as part of the longstanding federal desegregation order. Gudrun Lelash, the group's executive director, said Yonkers had violated the agreement it reached on May 25 with the county, which owns the park. Under the agreement, the city could use 4.25 acres of the 38-acre park for housing on the condition that the city dedicate another 25 acres to its park system within 60 days. But William M. Mooney, Yonkers corporation counsel, said the city had already dedicated 26 acres of parkland in 1998 that satisfy the terms of the agreement. ''The claims by F.C.W.C. are false. We feel this lawsuit has no merit,'' he said.</p>
