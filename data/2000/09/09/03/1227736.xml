        <p>Re ''Military Misrule in Pakistan'' (editorial, Aug. 28): Gen. Pervez Musharraf's plan for restructuring the Pakistani government seeks to create local, self-administered municipalities, shifting away from the failed structure of a large, centralized bureaucracy to put power into the hands of the people. It reserves a minimum of a third of the seats in councils at all levels for women.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Military Misrule in Pakistan'' (editorial, Aug. 28): Gen. Pervez Musharraf's plan for restructuring the Pakistani government seeks to create local, self-administered municipalities, shifting away from the failed structure of a large, centralized bureaucracy to put power into the hands of the people. It reserves a minimum of a third of the seats in councils at all levels for women.</p>
        <p>Your editorial defends ''the country's top politicians'' by claiming that General Musharraf has excluded them from the formation of the program, but that ignores the fact that these politicians are the root of Pakistan's problems. General Musharraf's attempt to collect billions of rupees in unpaid taxes has been stalled by these government officials. Their concerns do not include providing education, health care and proper sanitation. Rather, they are intent on personal aggrandizement.  ARIF RAFIQ  Greenvale, N.Y., Aug. 28, 2000</p>
