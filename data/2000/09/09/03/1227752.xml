        <p>The place to be for two days this summer was Hawaii, not because of the sandy beaches and the sunsets, but because some of the best young quarterbacks in the National Football League were competing in the Quarterback Challenge, a sort of ''Survivor'' for passers. The sexiest event, by far, was the long-distance throw.</p>
        <p>One by one, the throwers lined up like gunslingers readying for a shootout. Peyton Manning of Indianapolis and Jake Plummer, the scrambler from Arizona, each threw his pass 69 yards. Cade McNown, the Chicago Bears' quarterback, and Donovan McNabb of Philadelphia did even better, each tossing for 72 yards. Eventually, McNown and McNabb faced off in the finals. That's when the Eagles quarterback with the big arm blew away his competition.</p>
        <p>McNown's throw went a healthy 69 yards. Then came McNabb's pass, and it sailed, and sailed and sailed, landing 76 yards downfield. The other quarterbacks, who are accustomed to making fans gawk at their plays, were themselves taken aback at McNabb's raw power.</p>
        <p>For the second straight year, Plummer won the overall challenge, beating out older veterans like Atlanta's Chris Chandler, Washington's Brad Johnson and San Diego's Jim Harbaugh. But it was McNabb who caught everyone's attention with his moon shot.</p>
        <p>After the event, McNabb looked at the other young quarterbacks and felt a twinge of satisfaction at being part of what can only be called a quarterback renaissance.</p>
        <p>''Cade and I were having fun, cracking jokes on one another,'' McNabb remembered, standing recently at his locker in Veterans Stadium. ''Then we said to each other: 'Here are two young guys, with all these other young quarterbacks. We should take a picture. It might be worth something one day.' ''</p>
        <p>When the N.F.L. lost John Elway, Dan Marino and Steve Young to retirement, all in the past two years, there was concern about who would fill their shoulder pads. But, surprisingly, there is a healthy surplus of candidates, which is good news for a league that continues to expand.</p>
        <p>The number of solid young passers, more than a dozen, is at its highest level since 1983, when Elway, Marino, Ken O'Brien, Jim Kelly, Tony Eason and Todd Blackledge were selected in the first round of the draft. It is impossible to tell how many from this recent group, most drafted over the past two seasons, are Pro Bowlers or Pro Busts, but early indications are that a good number of them may be on their way to having productive careers.</p>
        <p>But there is something else happening at the position besides an increase in young arms. Many of them, like Manning and McNabb, were drafted not only for their abilities, but also for their capacity to handle the myriad off-the-field distractions and requests for their time from increasingly hungry, hostile and intrusive news media and fans.</p>
        <p>''The numbers of good quarterbacks is extremely high,'' said Ernie Accorsi, general manager of the Giants. ''Teams want talent at that position and that has always been the case and always will be. But there is some truth to the fact that teams are now looking for quarterbacks who can also handle what is a more complex game and a more complex society than it was 30 or 20 or even 10 years ago.''</p>
        <p>A Matter of Maturity</p>
        <p>Personnel directors point to Ryan Leaf as a prime example of what can happen when talent is the sole focus. Coming out of Washington State in 1998, Leaf was considered the player with the best physical skills, but the Chargers ignored signs of his immaturity. Leaf is trying to turn his career around and will start this season for the Chargers, but has proved incapable of consistently handling the pressure of being in the spotlight. He owns a career quarterback rating of 39, has been fined by the team for insubordination and has alienated his teammates.</p>
        <p>Indianapolis wanted Manning over Leaf, in part because the Colts believed Manning's maturity -- which Bill Polian, the general manager, called ''almost unparalleled for someone his age'' -- was as great an asset as his precision throws.</p>
        <p>For a quarterback in Philadelphia, maturity and thick skin are needed as much as a helmet. McNabb is trying to win over what is generally considered the nastiest group of fans in sports. Few local sports heroes, including Randall Cunningham, Mike Schmidt, Eric Lindros and Allen Iverson, have been able to quell the often-overwhelming, sometimes vicious negativity of Philadelphia fans consistently.</p>
        <p>When McNabb was drafted in April 1999, Eagles fans at Madison Square Garden lustily booed the pick.</p>
        <p>''It definitely is,'' McNabb said when asked if Philadelphia was the toughest city to play in. ''I look at it as you just focus on your job and try to be as productive as possible.</p>
        <p>''They've booed Santa Claus. They've booed Mike Schmidt. They've booed Curt Schilling. I know the whole deal. They booed Randall Cunningham. I just have to play my game, and if they boo, just deal with it.''</p>
        <p>So McNabb is one of football's young guns, but he is also part of a greater experiment, with  Philadelphia serving as the petri dish. Can a player who was drafted as much for his calm temperament as his talent survive in a city that is already trying to drain him of those positive attributes? Will Philadelphia give McNabb a chance to grow or run him out of town?</p>
        <p>Handling Pressure</p>
        <p>The other young quarterbacks, as promising as McNabb, are being allowed to develop in relatively benign circumstances. After only two seasons, scouts are calling Manning one of the best talents ever. Tampa Bay's Shaun King led the Buccaneers to the N.F.C. championship game last season. Steve McNair took Tennessee to the Super Bowl, where Kurt Warner was named the game's most valuable player.</p>
        <p>Akili Smith in Cincinnati, Charlie Batch in Detroit, Tim Couch in Cleveland, Daunte Culpepper in Minnesota, Matt Hasselbeck in Green Bay, Brian Griese in Denver, Jonathan Quinn in Jacksonville, Chris Redman in Baltimore, Chad Pennington with the Jets, Tee Martin in Pittsburgh and New England's Michael Bishop, who might run the option in goal-line situations this year, round out a solid group of prospects. The average age of these players: 24 years old.</p>
        <p>In 1999, five quarterbacks were drafted in the first round and one in the second. A year before that, seven quarterbacks total were picked.</p>
        <p>When asked if all of the young players have what it takes to make it in the N.F.L., Manning said, ''I think a lot of young players are being thrown right into the fire and I believe they can handle it.''</p>
        <p>''They can handle the pressure,'' said Vikings Coach Dennis Green, who drafted Culpepper in 1999 and named him the starter this season, ''but they have it tougher than most quarterbacks in the past because so much is expected of them so soon.''</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. quarterback, circa 2000, is asked to be superhuman. He is asked to win not in five years or three, but fewer. He is asked to digest offenses and defenses that are more complicated than ever. He is expected to throw the ball farther, harder and more accurately than quarterbacks past.</p>
        <p>After the practices and games, he must handle the live hook-up with CNN, Fox and ESPN, not to mention a radio spot or two with a 24-hour sports station. Was Joe Montana ever asked to do an Internet chat early in his career?</p>
        <p>This is not to say that an N.F.L. quarterback in decades past had it easy. Now, improved medical technology helps players recover from injuries faster, rules protect quarterbacks from vicious hits, and salaries are in the stratosphere.</p>
        <p>Still, Elway said recently that he had sympathy for today's young quarterbacks because ''there are many more pressures on them now than when I first got into the league.''</p>
        <p>Coolness and Maturity</p>
        <p>The league's largest sympathy vote must go to McNabb, who has not only carried himself with poise as the Eagles' future franchise player at quarterback, but has also handled the huge amount of off-field responsibilities and kept his head amid the league's most abusive fans.</p>
        <p>McNabb seems the perfect fit. At Syracuse he evolved into one of the best athletes in college football. But along with physical prowess, the 6-foot-2-inch, 226-pound McNabb was known as one of the most well-rounded players to attend the university.</p>
        <p>''Everyone knows about his arm, and the way he can run with the ball,'' said Eagles wide receiver Charles Johnson, who has become close friends with McNabb, ''but what few people know is how high his maturity level is.''</p>
        <p>When asked if he thought it was tough to be a young quarterback today McNabb, who is black, responded bluntly, ''Being a young black quarterback is a lot more pressure than just being a young quarterback.'' He declined to elaborate.</p>
        <p>''I'm in a tough situation because in football the past few years we haven't won very many games,'' McNabb said of the Eagles. ''I just want to win. I'm going to keep the outside away from the locker room.''</p>
        <p>Last season, McNabb experienced the growing pains of a rookie, throwing eight touchdown passes to seven interceptions, but he still beat the division champion, Washington, and the Super Bowl winner, St. Louis, for two of the Eagles' five victories.</p>
        <p>This year, McNabb has taken steps, on and off the field, to improve. In the locker room he has established himself as the clear leader, socializing with players at every position, a feat few Eagles starting quarterbacks in the past accomplished. McNabb is host of his own television and radio shows, something many high-profile quarterbacks in big markets do. It will make his life more hectic, but it is a good way to state his case directly to hardened Eagles fans without a media filter.</p>
        <p>On the field, he has improved his accuracy, to the point that he has leapfrogged fellow young throwers like Couch and McNown. During the Eagles' preseason game against Tennessee, McNabb completed 15 of 23 passes for 163 yards, 3 touchdowns and no interceptions -- in the first half. He also ran for 43 yards.</p>
        <p>''He's got a bright future ahead of him,'' Titans Coach Jeff Fisher said. ''He's got a strong arm, he's got nice touch and he showed he's got some scrambling ability.''</p>
        <p>If McNabb can continue his growth as a player, and pair those skills with his pleasant personality, he could become one of the league's biggest stars, in one of the N.F.L.'s harshest towns. ''But I have to keep growing,'' McNabb said, ''and keep proving I can excel at this game.''</p>
