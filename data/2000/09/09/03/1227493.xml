        <p>To the Editor: Marialisa Calta's  essay on the vacation preferences  of someone living in a vacation spot (''Taking a Break From Scenic Vermont,'' July 30) brought to mind a trip to Hawaii a few years ago.</p>
        <p>Before my wife and I left Colorado for Maui, people said to us: ''Oh, you're going to Maui? That's paradise.'' While we were on the western side of Maui planning a visit to the island's remote town of Hana, someone told us: ''Oh, you're going to Hana? It's paradise.''</p>

        <p>Before my wife and I left Colorado for Maui, people said to us: ''Oh, you're going to Maui? That's paradise.'' While we were on the western side of Maui planning a visit to the island's remote town of Hana, someone told us: ''Oh, you're going to Hana? It's paradise.''</p>
        <p>When we got to Hana, we told a woman: ''People on the mainland think Maui is paradise, and people on the other side of the island think Hana is paradise. Where do folks here go for vacation?'' She replied, ''Well, every year a bunch of us go to Las Vegas.''</p>
