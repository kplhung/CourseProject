        <p>MANOLO BLAHNIK says that the secret to toe cleavage, which he describes as a ''very important part of the sexuality of the shoe'' in ''Manolo Blahnik''  (Harper Collins, this month) by Colin McDowell, is in showing only ''the first two cracks.'' While I don't own a pair of Mr. Blahnik's famous pointy shoes, I know exactly what he means. There's something a little vulgar, a little splayed-looking, about a shod foot with more than three toes exposed.</p>
        <p>The sex-toe connection and other revelations (like Mr. Blahnik's predilection for jam and sugar scarfing, or the character sketches he concocts for each shoe he makes: ''She's from Jaipur, where she has a marvelous house, all cool colonnades and superbly polished tiles'') make this coffee-table biography both delicious and instructive. Mr. Blahnik, who has been making exciting shoes for more than two decades, is emerging as a kind of polymorphic celebrity: a bon vivant/shoemaker, whose unabashed eccentricities fascinate.</p>
        <p>You can learn a lot from books like Mr. McDowell's. Indeed, for the style-minded reader, fall books have never felt so prescriptive, so inspirational and so useful. Now I know the new rules of glamour, the importance of a red bedroom, and what to do with a princess skirt.</p>
        <p>To sort through it all, it's important, stylish reader, to know who or what you aspire to. ''Bright Young Things'' by Brooke de Ocampo, a contributing editor at Vogue and ''card-carrying B.Y.T. herself,'' according to the book's introduction, displays a huge menu of possibilities, and possible settings. This is a book of terrific apartments in Manhattan, where Ms. de Ocampo's B.Y.T.'s tend to live --  a portfolio of photographs and the decorating narratives of Hearsts and Rockefellers, von Stauffenbergs and Von Furstenbergs, Laurens and Lauders and Guerrand-Hermeses, with a couple of wild cards thrown in, like the painter Damian Loeb and Moby, the musician.</p>
        <p>Every B.Y.T. included herein has a fabulous job, a witty apartment, a great piece of art. If I were an editor at House &amp; Garden, I'd be tearing my hair out. There are 27 apartments in here, more than two years' worth of magazine features on leopard-print club chairs (Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer); plum-colored walls (Plum Sykes) and Warhol-designed wallpaper (in a panel made by the artist for the 21st birthday of Peter Bacanovic, the lucky banker who lives in the brownstone apartment where ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' was filmed).</p>
        <p>For a richer experience, cross-reference ''B.Y.T.'' with ''R.S.V.P.:  Menus for Entertaining From People Who Really Know How'' (Clarkson Potter, November) by Nan Kempner. You'll find offspring in the former, like Eliza Reed Bolen and Lulu de Kwiatkowski, and their parents in the latter, including Annette and Oscar de la Renta (mom and step-father to Eliza), who serve a mean lobster salad, and the de Kwiatkowskis, of Calumet Farm (mom and dad to Lulu). In distinct contrast to ''B.Y.T.,'' whose ''author,'' Brooke de Ocampo, hasn't written its narratives, there's a fuzzy, friendly feel to ''R.S.V.P.,'' if only because it's offered in Ms. Kempner's distinctive voice, well seasoned with personal pronouns and memories. You will also find the best recipe for roast chicken in its pages, from Robin Hambro's Italian cook, Luciana Guarduci.</p>
        <p>See if you can guess the identities of the models pictured in ''Vintage Style: Buying and Wearing Classic Vintage Clothes'' (Harper Collins, October) by Tiffany Dubin and Ann E. Berman without looking in ''B.Y.T.'' Ms. Dubin, who is the marketing director for the Auction Channel and who created the fashion department at Sotheby's, and her collaborator, Ann E. Berman, a writer for Town &amp; Country, make the rather trenchant point that since so-called high fashion right now is directly ''inspired'' by fashion's past, it would behoove you, stylish reader, to shop from the same vintage sources as the designers. In other words, why buy Gucci or Prada for thousands of dollars when you can buy original Giorgio di Sant'Angelo or Ossie Clark, in pristine condition, for mere hundreds, or much less?</p>
        <p>Like Ms. de Ocampo and Ms. Kempner, Ms. Dubin has collected her pals in her pages, but she skips the details, so each model seems as ''generic'' as the item she wears. For instance, a porcelain-skinned brunette in a princess skirt is identified only as ''Marina, writer'' (though you know from ''B.Y.T.'' that she's Marina Rust, a great-great-granddaughter of Marshall Field 3d, a contributing editor at Vogue and the owner of a Sargent sketch). On closer reading, you learn that the skirt was made by Carolyne Roehm, in the late 1980's -- it's something of a shock to think of this period as ''vintage.'' You learn by Ms. Rust's example that it's O.K. to wear a princess skirt with a white T-shirt and a knotted denim shirt ''for a morning's shopping in a resort town,'' but that ''on assignment'' you might consider a tiny tank top topped with a gold bolero jacket trimmed with fringe and crystals.</p>
        <p>''Sloan, talk show host'' models a waist-length, pink plastic bomber jacket, by Courreges. (A quick glance back at ''B.Y.T.'' reveals that it is Sloan Lindemann Barnett, a former assistant district attorney and a co-host of ''SheCommerce,'' a cable show produced by Oxygen Media, and that she has a husband named Roger Barnett, a Chagall and a predilection for pink decorating flourishes like mauve walls and fuchsia ostrich feathers.) Try the jacket, as Sloan does, with white jeans, or a pleated skirt, or a little black dress.</p>
        <p>If these stylish scrapbooks are making you ache with envy -- the apartments! the pedigrees! the clothes! -- an evening with ''4 Blondes'' (Atlantic Monthly, this month) by Candace Bushnell will bring you right down: ''4 Blondes'' is aversion therapy for social climbers.</p>
        <p>Like the characters in Evelyn Waugh's ''Decline and Fall,'' Ms. Bushnell's ersatz blondes make it hard to decide which is more depraved. There's Janey (''Nice 'n Easy''), an over-the-hill model, who sleeps her way into a summer house in the Hamptons each year; Winnie (''Highlights''), a not-quite-smart-enough magazine editor, who loathes her feckless writer husband and for whom a $500 pair of Manolo Blahniks -- toe cleavage! -- generates a sly plot twist; and Cecelia (''Snow Angel''), a pill-popping princess-by-marriage, who may or may not have murdered her best friend. The fourth blonde is Ms. Bushnell's stand-in, a sex columnist on assignment in England; she's the ''nice'' one, who wins a love interest on the last page.</p>
        <p>A more appealing quartet of blondes appears in a rather startling photograph in ''The Vogue Book of Blondes'' (Viking Studio, last month) by Kathy Phillips with a foreword by Donatella Versace, in which RuPaul towers over Kurt Cobain, Courtney Love and their daughter young Frances Bean Cobain.</p>
        <p>''You can't always have the longest legs or the perkiest breasts,'' Louis Licari, the self-described ''King of Color,'' says in this cheerful and sort of chaotic encyclopedia of blondness, which ranges from Jean Harlow to Brad Pitt, ''but being blond is part of the fantasy you can achieve.''</p>
        <p>Rather than splitting blond hairs, maybe you should just paint your bedroom. ''Paint just one wall in your bedroom in a really great color such as russet, ochre or Venetian red,'' advises Frederic Fekkai in ''A Year of Style'' (Clarkson Potter; October). ''Red makes you look more beautiful when you wake up.'' Of course, you learned that already from ''B.Y.T.,'' in which Plum Sykes, a Vogue editor, opines that ''a white room is the most boring thing in the world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fekkai, the handsome French hair stylist with salons in New York and Beverly Hills, is full of ''Why Don't You's,'' a whole year's worth. Here are a few. ''By all means wear fabulous sunglasses, but if you do, be ready to eliminate other accessories.'' ''Read the latest best-selling biography. Everyone will be talking about it this fall.'' And my favorite: ''Get a hands-free, cordless telephone with a headset. Holding the receiver to your ear is so 20th century.''</p>
        <p>''The Art of Growing Up: Simple Ways to Be Yourself at Last'' (Clarkson Potter, October) by Veronique Vienne is a nice companion for ''A Year of Style.'' You'll find it on the ''Self Help: Happiness'' shelf of your local bookstore, but don't let the label fool you; this is a style book, too. Ms. Vienne, the author of ''The Art of Doing Nothing'' and ''The Art of Imperfection,'' has compiled 10 ''New Rules of Glamour,'' which she describes as ''just another word for a little extra discipline.'' The first of these is: ''knowing how to choose a hat, clean paintbrushes and effortlessly negotiate a grand marble staircase in a tight evening gown.''</p>
        <p>Attitude-beautifiers will only take you so far. Style is, ultimately, visual, as any good B.Y.T. will tell you. Flip through ''Obsessed by Dress'' (Beacon Press, October), a book of quotations compiled by Tobi Tobias, the dance critic for New York magazine and a vintage-clothing wearer, for razor sharp remarks from social observers like Jean Rhys, Henry James and Wayne Koestenbaum, who wrote this one: ''At a now-defunct boutique called Ben's Village, I bought a pair of cotton tropical-print  unisex pants that I named 'fish pants' because blowsy fish swam on them in wallpaper patterns. A friend had advised when I told him there was no room in my life for fish pants, 'change your life to fit the pants.' ''</p>
        <p>Toe cleavage optional.</p>
        <p>MIRROR, MIRROR  Correction:  September 10, 2000, Sunday  An article last Sunday about new books on style misstated the magazine to which one author, Brooke de Ocampo, is a contributor. It is Harper's Bazaar, not Vogue. The article also referred incorrectly to her part in writing the narratives that accompany the photographs in her book, ''Bright Young Things,'' about Manhattan luxury apartments. She did have a role in writing them; she collaborated with Shax F. Riegler.</p>
