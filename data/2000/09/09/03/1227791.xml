        <p>Tire and car dealers struggled today to cope with customers who wanted to go on driving vacations for Labor Day weekend but were leery of relying on their Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>Dealers in hot-weather states like Texas and Florida, where the bulk of the tire problems have occurred, and in cooler states like Massachusetts said most customers this morning were owners of Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles seeking to replace tires that were among the 6.5 million factory-installed tires recalled on Aug. 9.</p>
        <p>Few customers today had heard of a warning issued by federal regulators on Friday that an additional 1.4 million Firestone tires sold over the last decade as replacements on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks could have even higher rates of tread separation than the recalled models.</p>
        <p>The heat was already sweltering this morning in Austin, Tex., when Dorothy Lee arrived at the Firestone dealer in a blue 1999 Explorer.</p>
        <p>She not only found five Explorers ahead of her but also was told she would have to leave her vehicle to have her tires exchanged, even though she had already waited three weeks for replacement tires.</p>
        <p>''This blows my whole vacation weekend,'' said Ms. Lee, 36, a nurse's assistant who had hoped to spend the day relaxing at home with her family in Kyle, a town 25 miles south of Austin. ''People shouldn't have to wait to get rid of tires that might kill them.''</p>
        <p>Auto and tire dealers, some of whom were not busy today, complained that they had not received instructions from automakers or Firestone on how to handle tires covered by Friday's advisory by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The announcement recommended that consumers ''consider replacing the tires in question and that you retain all documentation.''</p>
        <p>Nicky Cerundolo, the manager at Arlington Tire and Auto Center in Arlington, Mass., said he told his staff this morning that an advisory existed but that he had not received a list of the specific models involved.</p>
        <p>''Unbelievable -- there's so much information out there that you can't keep up with the information coming out, you can't keep up with the tires coming in,'' Mr. Cerundolo said, adding that no customers had bought Firestone tires since the recall began in early August.</p>
        <p>The Web site of the highway safety administration, www.nhtsa.dot.gov, carried the advisory with a list of tire models involved, but the site was flooded with inquiries today, making it hard to obtain the information.</p>
        <p>Cynthia McCafferty, a Firestone spokeswoman, repeated today the company's position that dealers would provide free inspections of any tires and would exchange tires if the customer insisted, provided replacement tires were available.</p>
        <p>Nissan, General Motors and Ford, all of which had installed some of the tires in Friday's advisory, said they would do whatever was necessary to satisfy customers, including replacing tires if customers insisted and if replacements were available.</p>
        <p>The automakers said they were trying to inform their dealers about the advisory.</p>
        <p>The highway safety administration said in the advisory that it asked Firestone on Wednesday to recall the additional tires and that the tire maker had refused to do so.</p>
        <p>A Ford official who insisted on anonymity said late Friday that the automaker had not been warned by Firestone of the request and that the advisory caught Ford by surprise, even though the list included tires installed at the factory on F-150 pickup trucks from 1996 to 1998.</p>
        <p>''We're a little irritated about it,'' the Ford official said.</p>
        <p>Officials at Nissan, which had installed the tires on almost 20,000 pickups from the 1991 to 1994 model years, said they had not been warned by Firestone. G.M. officials said they also had no warning.</p>
        <p>Firestone declined to comment on whether it alerted its customers before regulators issued the advisory. Ford and G.M. are Firestone's largest customers, while Nissan is a big Bridgestone customer. Bridgestone/ Firestone Inc., based in Nashville, is a unit of Bridgestone of Japan.</p>
        <p>The tire problems, and particularly the advisory, have created a rift between G.M. and Ford, the world's two largest automakers.</p>
        <p>Ford has increasingly blamed Firestone for the tire problems, which have mainly occurred on Ford Explorers.</p>
        <p>To G.M.'s irritation, Ford had called for Firestone to conduct a recall in Venezuela that could encompass some G.M. sport utility vehicles; Firestone had refused to do so, citing a lack of evidence.</p>
        <p>Ford officials welcomed the consumer advisory as an indication that the tire-related deaths were the result of tire problems and not a vehicle defect. Federal regulators have attributed at least 88 deaths to the tire failures.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Ford, Jon Harmon, said today that the automaker  had not suggested to regulators that they issue the advisory so as to shift blame away from Ford. Mr. Harmon said Ford had not been aware of the data on replacement tires and had not pointed it out to regulators.</p>
        <p>G.M. officials were dismayed by the advisory, which included 40,000 tires installed at the plant on 1991 Chevrolet Blazers in addition to off-road tires sold by Firestone dealers.</p>
        <p>As Ford has stepped up the pressure on Firestone, it has also done so indirectly on other automakers, by having engineers cut apart recalled tires to check for tread separation. The company announced a week ago that it had found separation rates in Firestone tires from Venezuela that were 500 times higher than the rates among recalled tires in the United States.</p>
        <p>Ford has already replaced Firestone tires on Explorers in Venezuela at its expense after Firestone refused to conduct a recall.</p>
        <p>Brook Lindbert, G.M.'s director of wheel and tire systems, said late Friday that G.M. has not encountered problems with Firestone tires and planned to continue buying them.</p>
        <p>G.M. has not cut apart Firestone tires to check for tread separation, and does not plan to do so, Mr. Lindbert said.</p>
        <p>Tread separation can be spotted through examination of the tire by a trained mechanic who looks for bulges or scalloping where the tread meets the sidewall, he said. Some drivers can notice a bumpiness in the ride of a vehicle with tire treads that  are beginning to separate.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Harmon of Ford questioned whether external examination could spot tread separation. ''Sometimes that's true,'' he said. ''but from what we understand, in many cases there's no warning.''</p>
        <p>He said Ford engineers had examined tires with no visible signs of problems on the outside, which, when cut apart, showed that the tread was separating.</p>
        <p>Although Ford and G.M. are Firestone's largest customers, Ford buys a higher percentage of its tires from Firestone than G.M. DaimlerChrysler has long relied on Goodyear and Michelin.</p>
        <p>In a sign that Ford's efforts to avoid blame for the tire problems may be paying off, sales of Ford Explorers and of Ford vehicles in general have stayed strong despite the recall.</p>
        <p>George Pipas, a Ford market analyst, predicted last Monday that Explorer sales in August would be in the ''high 30,000's,'' but might fall short of the 39,000 Explorers sold in August last year.</p>
        <p>But Ford announced on Friday afternoon that it sold 40,157 Explorers last month. Because dealerships were open one more day in August this year than in the same month last year, the daily sales rate for Explorers fell less than 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Martin Inglis, Ford's vice president of North American operations, said the company had difficulty calculating the distribution of sales within a month, and had been pleased with the final total.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Inglis conceded that Explorer sales would have been stronger if not for the recall. ''There was some weakening of Explorer versus where it might have been,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For all models and divisions, Ford's daily sales rate fell 3 percent last month from the pace in August of last year. Excluding Ford's Land Rover division, which it acquired on June 30, sales were up less than a tenth of 1 percent in absolute terms and down 3.7 percent in terms of the daily selling rate.</p>
