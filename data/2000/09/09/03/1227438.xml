        <p>SLIMMER RATES -- From Oct. 1 to Dec. 21, the Safety Harbor Resort and Spa, on Tampa Bay, is dropping prices on its introductory spa package 20 percent. Three nights' accommodations, three meals a day for three days and a daily 25-minute massage are $372 a person, double occupancy, and $497 single. Guests have access to all spa facilities, including daily exercise classes, and, in case the walk from the parking lot is too exhausting, free valet parking. A 17.5 percent service charge and taxes are extra. Call (888) 237-8772.</p>
        <p>WALES BY RAIL -- Sometimes, savings come by slicing off unwanted options. For those who want to visit Wales by rail but don't want to pay for a BritRail Pass, the Freedom of Wales Flexi Pass comes in two lengths. The shorter one allows four days of unlimited rail travel over eight days and bus travel all eight days, for $85 (a four-day pass for all of Britain is $235). A pass with eight days of rail travel over 15 days (again, with bus travel all 15 days included) is $159. Connections to Wales from selected cities in England are included, as are discount admissions to castles and other attractions. Rail travel does not have to be undertaken on consecutive days, but must begin after 9 a.m. on weekdays. Passes must be purchased before leaving the United States. Call (877) 677-1006.</p>
        <p>FARES TO ISRAEL -- Funjet Vacations has round-trip flights to Tel Aviv that start at $634 from Kennedy Airport for travel Nov. 1 to Dec. 12 and Dec. 25 to March 31. From Tuesday through Oct. 31 and Dec. 13 to 24, it's $779. Fares are identical from Boston. From Chicago, they are $714 or $904, based on the same low-high periods, and from Los Angeles or San Francisco, $789 and $929. The carriers are Swissair or Sabena and fares are based on midweek travel and can be booked up to a week before departure. International fees and taxes are extra. Call Funjet at (800) 558-3000; reservation operators should be asked for the K-class fares.</p>
