        <p>A certain Texas officeholder who is a candidate for office elsewhere has to hope that he will fare better in his race than the state's two major league baseball teams have this year in theirs.</p>
        <p>The Texas Rangers and the Houston Astros have had remarkably similar experiences. Winners of three division championships in the past four years but not advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs in any of those years, the Rangers and the Astros both lost key players, voluntarily or involuntarily, last winter and both have spent most of the season in last place.</p>
        <p>One of the few bright spots for each team has been a player who has broken the franchise's record for hitting in consecutive games. But their season will not be remembered for the feats of Gabe Kapler and Tony Eusebio. The season will be remembered for the great plunge.</p>
        <p>''It must have something to do with the drought we're having in Texas,'' Gerry Hunsicker, the Astros' general manager, said.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, it's been a rough year in Texas,'' said Doug Melvin, the Rangers' general manager, referring to baseball, not weather. ''Things just didn't go as planned. I think with both of us it was the cost of having success, the cost of winning divisions.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers last year had the second highest payroll; only the Yankees paid their players more. They began this season as No. 9, having lowered their payroll from $81.6 million to $70.8 million. The Astros ended last season 11th in payroll ($55 million) and began this season 19th ($51 million).</p>
        <p>During the winter, the Rangers traded Juan Gonzalez and lost, not all willingly, Todd Zeile, Aaron Sele, Mark McLemore and Tom Goodwin as free agents. The Astros traded Mike Hampton, Carl Everett and Derek Bell and let Ricky Gutierrez leave as a free agent.</p>
        <p>''Winning once you can get by,'' Melvin said, speaking of the economics of success. ''We won three of four; they won three in a row. Your payroll goes sky high. The salaries continue to escalate.''</p>
        <p>Hunsicker acknowledged that the Astros made moves partly for economic reasons. They also wanted to make room for some younger players they thought were ready, he said.</p>
        <p>Addressing the economic part, he said: ''We have a budget and we have to live within our means, even moving into a new stadium. A player like Rickey Gutierrez was probably missed more than we anticipated. He's a player we undervalued.''</p>
        <p>''We didn't strengthen ourselves with the moves we made during the winter,'' he added. ''But I expected the team to contend in our division. A lot of people point to the off-season moves as the beginning of our demise. I don't share those opinions. I think the lineup we put on the field had the potential to be as good as the '98 team, which was the best offensively in the history of the franchise.''</p>
        <p>The Astros' pitching, Hunsicker said, was a question mark going in. But, he said: ''It's been a question mark for this franchise every year. But every year we've had people rise to the occasion and perform above expectations. More and more I think that's what has to happen for clubs to win. Pitching has to exceed expectations.''</p>
        <p>No one expected the Astros' pitchers to suffer the major shock that accompanied the move from the Astrodome to Enron Field.</p>
        <p>''I think the new park has had a greater effect on our club than anticipated,'' Hunsicker said. ''No club can win without a home-field advantage. In the first half it wasn't an advantage for us. We've played much better since then at home. Pitchers are adapting more to the ballpark, realizing that it is realistic to pitch well in this park. You just don't have the margin for error you have in other parks.''</p>
        <p>The Astros have gone from having one of the most efficient pitching staffs in the league (3.83 earned run average) to having the least efficient (5.33) and from allowing the fewest home runs (128) to being among the leaders in giving up the most (184). The pitchers haven't been helped by the defense, which has already committed more errors (110) than last season (106).</p>
        <p>''Our record would be better if we hadn't made any moves in the off-season,'' Hunsicker said, ''but I would be hard pressed to think we'd be in first place or close to first given the breakdowns we've had in key areas.''</p>
        <p>The Rangers ended last season with eight players who could be free agents.</p>
        <p>''We had a chance to be older and more expensive,'' Melvin said. ''For us to keep the players that helped us win the past two years we probably would have had a $95 million payroll with players on long-term contracts. We would have had to stay at 95 for a good two or three years. That's why we felt we had to make some moves.''</p>
        <p>Trading Gonzalez was the biggest decision the Rangers had to make, but failing to sign Zeile and Sele, the free agents they wanted to retain, hurt the most.</p>
        <p>''Sele kept turning me down on $28 million,'' Melvin said, referring to his four-year offer to the pitcher who subsequently signed with Seattle for two years and $15 million. ''I wasn't aggressive on Zeile early on. I didn't go to a third year until the last minute.''</p>
        <p>As a result of the absent players, Melvin said: ''We have not been nearly as good as a team. We took some risks and ended up relying on a lot of ifs. In the past we had been a solid veteran team. We knew what players were going to do for us. This year we went a lot based on potential. It didn't happen. Then we had injuries.''</p>
        <p>Melvin, in comparing these developments, said: ''Last year we won 95 games, had the best year in franchise history and lost 10 to 12 million dollars. This year we have a chance to have the worst record in a long time, and they tell me we can break even.''</p>
        <p>Milestones Are in Reach</p>
        <p>Can Darin Erstad break George Sisler's major league record for hits? Can Todd Helton become the first player to hit .400 since Ted Williams in 1941? Can Carlos Delgado become the first Triple Crown winner since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967?</p>
        <p>Seldom has there been a season in which three such sterling offensive achievements were within reach in the final four weeks.</p>
        <p>Erstad: The Anaheim hit man has 205 hits. With 27 games remaining, he would basically have to average 1.926 hits a game to tie Sisler's record of 257 in 1920, 1.963 to break it. Given the difficulty of registering such averages, Erstad would settle for two hits a game.</p>
        <p>Helton: He is hitting .391 after a hitless game yesterday. If, in the Rockies' final 27 games, he averaged 3.62 at-bats a game, his average for his first 133 games this season, he would have to get 44 hits to finish at .40069, or .401. Forty-three hits would take him only to .399 (.39896).</p>
        <p>Delgado: The Toronto first baseman is second in the American League in hitting at .362, tied for second in runs batted in with 124 and tied for first in home runs with 39. Nomar Garciaparra of Boston is ahead of him in average at .366, and Erstad is right behind at .361. He is four R.B.I. behind Edgar Martinez of Seattle, tied with Mike Sweeney of Kansas City and just ahead of Frank Thomas of Chicago (122). He is tied in home runs with Thomas and Troy Glaus of Anaheim.</p>
        <p>One-Hit Wonders</p>
        <p>Pedro Martinez, as usual, was so overwhelming in his start against Tampa Bay last Tuesday that his one-hit performance (John Flaherty's leadoff single in the ninth inning) overshadowed performances in other games that night. The Devil Rays were not the only team to get only one hit that night. They were, in fact, only one of three teams that got only one hit that night.</p>
        <p>A one-out single by Barry Bonds in the first inning was the only hit San Francisco managed against Pittsburgh (Kris Benson eight innings, Josias Manzanillo one inning). James Mouton's two-run home run in the sixth inning was the lone Milwaukee hit against Los Angeles (Chan Ho Park eight, Mike Fetters one).</p>
        <p>The last time one day's schedule produced three games in which teams got no more than one hit, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, was Sept. 24, 1988. Cleveland had one hit against Dave Stieb of Toronto, Texas one hit against Mark Langston of Seattle and Philadelphia no hits against Pascual Perez of Montreal in a rain-shortened five-inning game.</p>
        <p>Making an Appointment?</p>
        <p>Arthur Richman, the senior adviser in the Yankees' media relations department, has a special interest in the outcome of the presidential contest between George W. Bush, former managing partner of the Texas Rangers, and Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Richman said he told Bush five years ago that he would someday be president of the United States. After asking him what he was smoking, Richman, a friend of the Bush family, said that Bush told him, ''If I become president, I'm going to appoint you my good-will ambassador to the world.''</p>
        <p>Richman has his passport ready.</p>
