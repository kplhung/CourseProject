        <p>AS the mother of small children I have tried to keep my writing free of bathroom humor, but there are times it is irresistible. This is one of them.</p>
        <p>All I wanted to do was replace two pieces of paneling in our downstairs bathroom that had received water damage from a leaky window I got the O.K. from my husband to rip them out and replace them.</p>
        <p>Right now there are people reading this who are already laughing. There are people who have started out just this way and ended up selling their homes. Why? Because the project snowballed into a construction project of such magnitude that they would rather start fresh in a new location, perhaps another state, where they would never be reminded of the day they ''just wanted to replace two sheets of paneling.''</p>
        <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
        <p>Pry bar in hand, I attacked the task. I had to take up the molding to remove the offending panels.</p>
        <p>Behind the paneling was a garden of yellowed yellow roses. Patterned  sometime in the early 1940's, they had obviously bloomed from the fertile mind of some ancient Martha Stewart. ''Ooooh, said my 5-year-old son, Ian. ''What's that?''</p>
        <p>''Cave paintings,'' I joked.</p>
        <p>''Cool,'' he said and yelled to his older brother. ''Hey Zoltan, Cavemen painted flowers on our bathroom and Mom just found them!''</p>
        <p>Just about that time I realized that the 60-year-old linoleum was buckled and curling away from the wall.</p>
        <p>''Might as well tear it out,'' my husband said. ''We have a new sheet of linoleum ready to go there anyway so let's just get it over with.''</p>
        <p>So I had at it and in a few minutes I was striding out to the yard, where hubby was doing some work of his own. I held in my hand something I knew was going to change out lives -- and not for the better.</p>
        <p>''What now?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>''I could be wrong,'' I said. ''but I don't think this is a good thing.''</p>
        <p>He looked at my open palm and said, ''Acorns?''</p>
        <p>It took a moment as the half-eaten squirrel booty triggered the breaking of the dawn.</p>
        <p>''Where?'' he asked numbly.</p>
        <p>''Under the linoleum,'' I said. ''And tucked into all the corners of the floor where it had separated from the wall and you can see the crawl space under the house.'' I didn't get much further. I was drowned out by my husband's groaning.</p>
        <p>He looked over the damage. Then he took on that look that scares me. It's the look that says, ''Time for Plan B.'' He said, ''Well, maybe now's the time to take out this wall and expand the bathroom.''</p>
        <p>He told me to go back in and ''rip it all out.'' Take out everything: the  paneling, wallboard, insulation, down to the studs.</p>
        <p>So I went back into the money pit that I call home, tied a bandanna on my head, drank a cup of coffee and waded into the sea of my discontent.</p>
        <p>I hit the jackpot on my first try. The wallboard I chose to yank from its moorings rained a collection of nuts and squirrel tidbits that must have been a rodent Fort Knox.</p>
        <p>I really don't remember much after that. It's like what the Celts call battle haze. There was a lot of rending, tearing, hauling. I came away with some scrapes and bruises.</p>
        <p>Now the bathroom is a shell of it's former self, and here comes Plan C.</p>
        <p>This scares me more than Plan B because it's bigger and crazier. It  involves my husband suggesting we go house hunting.</p>
        <p>He said casually, ''I saw this old Victorian that needs work and now this really has me thinking about a new project.''</p>
        <p>One of two things has happened here. Either he has completely snapped his carrot, or the shock of it all killed me on impact and I am actually lying dead on the bathroom floor with a handful of acorns.</p>
        <p>Either way, house repair had made us both nuts.</p>
