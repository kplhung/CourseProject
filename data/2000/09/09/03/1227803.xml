        <p>On the campaign stump, Vice President Al Gore pushes his plan for a Medicare prescription drug benefit as a humane effort to help older Americans who are being gouged by profit-hungry pharmaceutical manufacturers. In television commercials, Gov. George W. Bush's campaign characterizes the Gore plan as another example of bureaucracy run amok.</p>
        <p>But presidential politics, where sound bites often trump substance, is far simpler than drug pricing, and beneath the candidates' harsh oratory lurk complex questions about the economics of drug advertising, the dynamics of price controls, and the budgets of research laboratories.</p>
        <p>The answers will affect not only the elderly and taxpayers in general, but also the shape of the prescription drug business, one of the nation's most lucrative industries.</p>
        <p>With more sophisticated and expensive medicines being introduced every year, a big question is whether Medicare will be able to afford them. The drug industry's trade group says the plan will inevitably run out of money, resulting in price controls, which could prompt cutbacks in research. But the drug companies typically spend more on advertising than they do on research, leading the vice president to suggest they can well afford a dip in prices.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, this is not the kind of issue that bumper stickers are made of,'' said Gail R. Wilensky, who ran the Health Care Financing Administration, the agency that administers the Medicare program, under Mr. Bush's father when he was president. ''The good news is we don't pass legislation in campaigns.''</p>
        <p>Pharmaceutical pricing legislation is fraught with unintended consequences. The last time Congress passed a bill it thought would lower drug prices was in 1990, when it required drug manufacturers to offer their lowest prices to the federal Medicaid program. The result, according to a 1996 study by the Congressional Budget Office, was that the manufacturers simply raised prices for health maintenance organizations. So the government paid less, but private insurers paid more.</p>
        <p>With profits that rank consistently higher than other Fortune 500 companies and products that can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year, the drug industry has long been an easy target for politicians. Forty years ago, Estes Kefauver, the Democratic senator from Mr. Gore's home state of Tennessee, held hearings into the pricing practices of drug companies.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no issue touches as many lives as the price of medication, which is one reason the issue is dominating the political debate. Another has to do with economics: while prescription drugs account for only 9 percent of all health care spending,  they are now the fastest-growing segment of the national health bill.</p>
        <p>In 1998, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans spent $91 billion on prescription medications; the total is expected to reach $243 billion in 2008. The elderly bear a disproportionate burden: they account for 13 percent of the population but more than a third of all drug spending, and nearly one-third of them lack insurance coverage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan to ease that burden is nearly identical to President Clinton's. Except for the poorest of the poor, the elderly would not have insurance covering the full cost of all their prescription drugs. Older Americans whose incomes are 135 percent of the poverty level or lower, about $12,000 a year for an individual and $14,000 for couples, would have all of their drug costs covered.</p>
        <p>Others would pay premiums on a sliding scale, and would be reimbursed for half the cost of their prescriptions up to $5,000 a year. Once the $5,000 cap has been met, beneficiaries would pay out of pocket, up to an additional $1,500. After that, a catastrophic insurance provision would kick in, and the government would pay all additional drug bills.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign estimates the cost of the proposal at $253 billion over 10 years; an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimates the president's plan would cost $297 billion during that time. But the actual cost, Ms. Wilensky said, is extremely difficult to predict.</p>
        <p>''Our ability to accurately project prescription drug costs, particularly if you say you are not going to have administered pricing -- that's the polite word for price controls -- is poor,'' Ms. Wilensky said.</p>
        <p>A central feature of the Gore plan is that it offers a uniform benefit; in each region, all Medicare beneficiaries would be covered by the same plan, administered by a single pharmacy benefits manager under contract with Medicare.</p>
        <p>That kind of government control worries the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Gore's plan would effectively give Medicare vast purchasing power, enabling the government to extract deep discounts from drug makers. Medicare drug prices would then become public -- in the private sector, negotiated discounts are kept secret -- and private insurers would inevitably demand similar breaks.</p>
        <p>''Medicare is the big gorilla,'' Prof. Uwe Reinhardt, the Princeton University health care economist, said in an interview last month. But with more people covered by insurance, he argued, the volume of prescriptions would rise, which would offset any decrease in prices.</p>
        <p>Like most Republicans, Mr. Bush favors letting the private sector handle prescription drug coverage, an approach that has drawn criticism because many private insurers say they will not offer drug benefits. The Bush campaign has characterized the Gore proposal as a ''one-size-fits-all plan'' that would interfere with the authority of doctors, presumably by restricting the list of drugs covered by insurance.</p>
        <p>In fact, said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington, such restrictive lists, called formularies, are far more likely to emerge under the Republican approach. That is because the private sector would offer varied plans, giving consumers the opportunity to save money by choosing plans that restricted access.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's plan, Mr. Reischauer said, ''The notion that the government will choose your drugs is far from the reality that will evolve.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will offer a specific prescription drug proposal next week, his campaign says. His aides have said he would incorporate a prescription drug benefit into an overhaul of the Medicare program, building on work of a bipartisan Congressional commission that has called for competition between the public and private sectors. The commission's proposal, which like the Gore plan would have the government absorb prescription drug costs for the very poor, has been introduced as legislation by Senators John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, and Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican.</p>
        <p>These two approaches -- a uniform Medicare benefits package versus a range of private sector plans -- reflect deep ideological differences between Democrats and Republicans about the proper role of government. Caught in the middle are the drug makers, who are siding with Mr. Bush. Since last year, according to an analysis by the Campaign Study Group, drug makers have contributed $235,515 to Mr. Bush compared with $50,700 for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>During his campaign, the vice president has relentlessly attacked the companies as price gougers. But the forces that are driving prescription drug spending are complicated.</p>
        <p>The increase, experts say, is not so much because manufacturers are raising prices on existing medicines but because patients are switching to newer medications that cost more. At the same time, more prescriptions are being written, because the population is aging and older people take more drugs.</p>
        <p>And there is another possible explanation: advertising, according to Steven Findlay of the National Institute for Healthcare Management Foundation, a nonprofit research group. During campaign stops in Florida and Oregon this week, Mr. Gore has asserted, correctly, that many drug companies spend more on marketing than research. He singled out one of the most widely advertised medications, Claritin, the antihistamine by Schering-Plough.</p>
        <p>Mr. Findlay is studying television advertising of prescription medicines, which has flourished since the  regulations were relaxed three years ago. ''The numbers are quite compelling,'' he said. ''The drugs that are the most heavily advertised to consumers are the ones that are driving the increase in spending,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Those figures raise more questions: Are some people taking costly prescription drugs when cheaper, over-the-counter ones will do? If so, who? And how can they and their doctors be persuaded to use medicines more cost-effectively?</p>
        <p>There is scant literature on the topic, said John Golenski, executive director of RxHealth Value, a coalition of consumer, labor, business and insurance groups. ''The question of what is appropriate from a medical perspective is more acute than it ever was,'' Mr. Golenski said, ''and that question is not addressed by either party's plan.''</p>
