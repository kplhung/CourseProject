        <p>Seton Hall has been fined $12,600 by the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration for failing to train its student residence advisers how to respond to fire alarms and for not providing them with protective gear in the event of a real fire, the agency said last week. A meeting between university and OSHA officials is scheduled for Tuesday to discuss measures Seton Hall has taken to address the violations.
