        <p>More than two years after two New Jersey state troopers opened fire on three unarmed men on the New Jersey Turnpike, turning racial profiling into a national issue, the criminal case against the troopers is fraying and a series of closed-door decisions by prosecutors and the trial judge during the next several weeks will determine whether the most serious charge, attempted murder, is dropped.</p>
        <p>The resolution to this complex legal issue is being decided in a highly charged political environment, with the troopers' supporters insisting that the officers are being persecuted for an honest mistake, and civil rights leaders portraying the case as the ultimate test of the state's resolve to apply discipline in cases of police misconduct.</p>
        <p>The troopers, John Hogan and James Kenna, were indicted last year on charges of attempted murder for firing 11 shots into a van they had stopped on the turnpike. Three of the van's four occupants, who were all young black or Hispanic men from New York City, were wounded. The police maintain that they fired in self-defense after the driver backed up and the van struck Trooper Hogan.</p>
        <p>In recent months, two truck drivers have come forward, saying they witnessed the shootings; they gave statements that the troopers' lawyers say bolster the self-defense claim.</p>
        <p>This week, prosecutors were granted a two-month delay to reassess the evidence and, according to three lawyers involved in the case, to consider dropping the attempted murder charges.</p>
        <p>Since the shootings, which occurred just before 11 p.m. on April 23, 1998, near southbound Exit 7A in Cranbury, allegations of widespread discrimination by some of New Jersey's 2,800 troopers have led to political protests and several investigations. Some racial-profiling claims have been substantiated, and the New Jersey attorney general agreed to take steps intended to prevent racial profiling by the state police and allow a federal judge to monitor their conduct.</p>
        <p>As a result of the investigation into the van shootings, Troopers Hogan and Kenna were also charged with falsely reporting the race of some other drivers they had pulled over during earlier traffic stops, to conceal the fact that they had singled out black and Hispanic drivers. These charges are not affected by the new testimony, according to the troopers' lawyers.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have not yet turned over the statements by the new witnesses to defense lawyers, and have declined to discuss how the testimony will affect their strategy. Nonetheless, the delay -- and the possibility that prosecutors will alter the charges against the troopers -- has brought heated reaction from across the political spectrum. Leaders of the State Troopers Fraternal Association, the troopers' union, released a statement this week saying they were heartened that Judge Andrew J. Smithson of State Superior Court was considering a motion to drop the charges. He is to announce his ruling by Oct. 31.</p>
        <p>''The S.T.F.A. hopes that Judge Smithson and the attorneys can come to an expeditious conclusion to this case so that Troopers Hogan and Kenna can be allowed to get on with their lives,'' said the union president, Ed Lennon.</p>
        <p>Civil rights leaders, meanwhile, say that prosecutors have already weakened their own credibility with many black and Hispanic state residents by allowing the case to drag on for more than two years. The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, said it would be irresponsible for prosecutors to throw out charges without a hearing in open court.</p>
        <p>''If these two mysterious witnesses had surfaced two years after the shooting, and made statements which were damaging to the police, would they be treated the same way?'' Mr. Jackson asked. ''I think they should be brought in to testify, to be cross-examined, and let the public assess their credibility as well. If there's evidence that the officers are innocent, no one wants to see them found guilty. But if the prosecutor and the judge just drop the charges, there's going to be a whole lot of furor. People will not believe that justice has been done.''</p>
        <p>The shootings occurred as Keshon Moore, of the Bronx, was driving a rented van to a basketball camp in North Carolina. Troopers Hogan and Kenna told investigators that they had stopped the van because the driver had been speeding.</p>
        <p>The troopers said they opened fire because they feared for their lives after Mr. Moore shifted into reverse and the van backed toward them, knocking Trooper Hogan to the ground. Three of the men inside were wounded.</p>
        <p>But the troopers' versions of the shootings were contradicted by a civilian witness and by occupants of the van, and their accounts also conflicted with each other's. Trooper Kenna said he heard Trooper Hogan yell for help after being knocked down, but Trooper Hogan told investigators that he had never shouted. The civilian witness, a dentist who had been bicycling across a nearby overpass, told investigators that Trooper Hogan shot at the van as it rolled across the roadway, away from him and Trooper Kenna.</p>
        <p>One of the wounded men, Danny Reyes, told investigators that Trooper Kenna fired as Mr. Reyes's hands were raised and he was begging the troopers not to shoot. Mr. Reyes said the last bullet fired, which struck near his spine, hit him after the van had backed up and passed the troopers, crossed the road and was headed into a ditch.</p>
        <p>After a 16-month investigation -- during which the authorities closed a six-mile stretch of the turnpike to re-enact the shootings -- a forensics expert testified that at the time of the shootings, the van was moving at only about 4 miles per hour, far slower than the troopers had described.</p>
        <p>The grand jury returned the indictments last September and since then, defense lawyers have tried to rebut the prosecution's case by pointing out that just after the shootings, Mr. Moore told investigators that he was to blame for the incident because his foot had slipped onto the gas pedal, causing the car to back up toward the officers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Moore's lawyer, Peter Neufeld, said several months ago that his client told that to investigators only because he felt ''survivor's guilt'' and that he did not make a similar statement to the grand jury.</p>
        <p>The truckers' statements are significant because they apparently suggest that the troopers shot only as the van rolled toward them, and ceased firing once it reached the roadway and rolled into the ditch.</p>
        <p>Trooper Hogan's lawyer, Robert Galantucci, said those statements meshed with testimony that a ballistics expert gave to the grand jury, stating that the trajectory of the bullets proved that no shots were fired as the van rolled into the ditch.</p>
        <p>''The only time they fired is when they can articulate a reason for jeopardy,'' Mr. Galantucci said in an interview this week.</p>
        <p>But other people involved in the case question the truckers' motives and the accuracy of their statements. The first trucker offered his account to the police only after he was stopped for speeding in March and sought leniency, according to lawyers on both sides. Investigators said his credibility was further eroded because he claimed that he stopped his truck just after the shootings and spoke to the driver of a car that was hit by Mr. Moore's van. But the police say the car's driver, Eric Jusino, has told investigators that he did not speak to any civilian.</p>
        <p>Investigators, though, say they consider the second driver's story more credible, although that driver also kept silent for 23 months after the shooting. He said he did so because he feared that his statements would weaken the troopers' legal case.</p>
        <p>Trooper Kenna's lawyer, Jack Arseneault, said that despite the witnesses' delay in coming forward, their statements were compelling and clearly supported the troopers' claims of self-defense.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jackson and other New Jersey civil rights leaders say they fear that the state may place too much weight on the truckers' statements and use them to end the embarrassing media spectacle that the turnpike case has become. The legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, Lenora Lapidus, said that despite the state's admission that some officers routinely discriminated against blacks, women and Hispanics, the attorney general's office was still fighting a class-action suit filed by drivers who contend that they were victims of racial profiling.</p>
        <p>Trooper Hogan's lawyer, Mr. Galantucci, said he did not dispute evidence that many troopers engaged in discrimination for years, but he contended that it would be a grave injustice to punish the two troopers for the failings of the entire force.</p>
        <p>''There was clearly an institutional problem,'' Mr. Galantucci said. ''But it's not something that was created by Hogan or Kenna.''</p>
