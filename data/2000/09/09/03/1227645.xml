        <p>GARDEN historians often refer to the first third of the 20th century as a Golden Age in the history of American garden design. It was a time when wealthy people, their tastes honed by travel, had both the capital and the confidence to commission elaborate landscapes to match their magnificent homes. In New Jersey and elsewhere in the tristate area, some of the best of those gardens were designed by Ethelbert Furlong (1894-1993), a landscape architect with an unusual name and a singular career, spanning over 60 years.</p>
        <p>Furlong began his career as a young teenager, when he mistakenly thought that a newspaper ad for a ''nursery man'' meant that he would have the opportunity to work with children. He took the job, even after finding out that it involved driving a wagon full of shrubs and trees to landscape installation sites.</p>

        <p>GARDEN historians often refer to the first third of the 20th century as a Golden Age in the history of American garden design. It was a time when wealthy people, their tastes honed by travel, had both the capital and the confidence to commission elaborate landscapes to match their magnificent homes. In New Jersey and elsewhere in the tristate area, some of the best of those gardens were designed by Ethelbert Furlong (1894-1993), a landscape architect with an unusual name and a singular career, spanning over 60 years.</p>
        <p>Furlong began his career as a young teenager, when he mistakenly thought that a newspaper ad for a ''nursery man'' meant that he would have the opportunity to work with children. He took the job, even after finding out that it involved driving a wagon full of shrubs and trees to landscape installation sites.</p>
        <p>Furlong progressed quickly to supervising installations, and he began learning drafting skills as a draftsman's apprentice. He eventually worked as a draftsman for a New York architectural firm in 1917 and in 1921, he hung out his own shingle.  He was admitted to the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1933.</p>
        <p>His granddaughter, the landscape architect Joan Furlong, said that her grandfather made his last drawings in 1984 when he was 89.</p>
        <p>Landscapes are ephemeral things, and many of Furlong's survive only in the cache of drawings kept by his granddaughter. What distinguishes his body of work, and makes it relevant today, are themes and motifs that appear again and again.</p>
        <p>His early designs, created during the 1920's and 30's, were mostly for estate gardens, full of traditional elements and axial symmetry. After serving in World War II he turned in a new direction and began producing modernist landscapes that were spare, asymmetrical and often incorporated Asian ideas. As his career progressed, Furlong created landscapes for everything from corporate campuses to public housing projects in Newark. In 1949, when House Beautiful magazine needed a landscape design to match its sleek modern ''Pace-Setter House,'' the editors turned to Ethelbert Furlong.</p>
        <p>Though he had never visited either Japan or the Asian mainland, his appreciation of the traditions of Eastern gardening led to the creation of a number of Japanese-style landscapes. Ultimately he collaborated with architect Philip Johnson on a Japanese garden for the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p>
        <p>Furlong gardens have many things in common, among them the use of mixed hard-scaping materials-different sizes and colors of stone, brick and slate-combined within a single design. His home garden in Essex, N.J., is typical, featuring pathways paved with tiny pebbles, surrounded by borders made of larger stones. Subtle changes of level, sometimes marked by rough stones, are another constant, as are juxtapositions of curves and angles.  Fannie Clark, a gardener and garden designer who worked for Furlong said: ''His gardens have an informal 'formalism.' They make you pay attention.''</p>
        <p>Furlong gardens are full of surprises. Some of his brick walls have oval windows that allow the viewer to look into adjoining garden rooms.  Others are designed so that there are spaces between the bricks, creating an openwork pattern. Furlong gardens, large and small, are also full of little pathways that lead to discreet niches, statues or other intimate focal points.</p>
        <p>Water, in the form of small waterfalls, pools and fountains was an integral part of many of the landscapes.  Sadly, in most of the surviving Furlong gardens that I walked through, the water features are neglected, the stone basins empty, and the intricate fountainheads no longer trickle a musical stream.</p>
        <p>Changing tastes and development have obliterated many of Furlong's works, but some homeowners have made efforts to restore or maintain them. Though she does not own a Furlong garden, Diane Clark of Fair Haven, N.J., has gone a step further.  As a volunteer for the Garden Clubs of America, she is part of a program sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution to document America's heritage of significant gardens. Ms. Clark has tracked down Furlong gardens in various places, assembling photographs of them and coordinating her efforts with Joan Furlong, who has kept grandfather's work diaries and meticulously executed site plans.  The two women hope to find even more photographs and documentation of gardens that no longer exist.</p>
        <p>Eventually the pictures and some of the plans will go to the Smithsonian Institution's collection. However, even the Smithsonian does not have room for the hundreds of drawings.  Joan Furlong hopes to donate them to an educational institution so that future generations of landscape architects can relive a part of the Golden Age through the work of Ethelbert Furlong.</p>
