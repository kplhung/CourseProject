        <p>BACK in the 1920's, the designer Basil Ionides was one of Britain's brightest aesthetic lights. His books -- ''Color and Interior Decoration'' and ''The Modern English Interior'' -- were best sellers, the former chockablock with watercolor illustrations of his homes, prime examples of a scientific approach to the play of light on bold but carefully graded color schemes. Ionides's professional piece de resistance was the 1929 mirror-and-glass decoration of the Savoy Theater in London, whose icy glitter still staggers the eye.</p>
        <p>Ionides (pronounced eye-AH-nuh-deez) was also an outstanding collector. By the time of his death in 1950, at 66, the half-Greek, half-English designer and color theorist and his wife, Nellie, had amassed an impressive haul of early Chinese porcelain. A dish from this cache, which was sold at Sotheby's in 1963 and 1964, will be a centerpiece of an exhibition at the Chinese Porcelain Company at 475 Park Avenue (58th Street) from Oct. 12 to Oct. 28.</p>
        <p>Measuring 13 1/2 inches in diameter and about 3 inches deep, the dish is a rare example of Kangxi famille noire, a style of decoration whose floral motifs and naturalistic scenes are set on a near-black background. What makes the 18th-century antique special is the dark background's gentle luster, a fleeting, slightly metallic sheen that an enraptured early observer poetically called ''the reflections of a raven's wing.'' Curious, too, is the technique behind the effect, which must have appealed to Ionides, whose hallmark was layering of different tones of paint to create a vivacious surface. Since pure black was difficult to achieve by Chinese potters of the day, they created a near-black effect by applying various shades of green over blackish-brown enamels.</p>
        <p>The show, whose 30-odd exhibits include blanc de chine and famille verte, features an additional famille noire treasure: a baluster vase once owned by John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his son Nelson. Records indicate that the vase may have been purchased from the estate of J. Pierpont Morgan. Both it and the Ionides dish now belong to a private collector in South America.</p>
        <p>Basil Ionides came by his aestheticism naturally, growing up in a clan of prominent Byzantine Greeks who emigrated to England around 1820, eventually gaining fame as patrons of London's art world in the late 19th century. An aunt was a muse to William Morris, the high priest of the Arts and Crafts movement. Several family members were painted by Watts, Rossetti and Burne-Jones, the Pre-Raphaelite artists; Oscar Wilde and James McNeill Whistler were family friends.</p>
        <p>The son of a fitfully successful stockbroker, Ionides was a delicate, spoiled child whose artistic bent triumphed over a spotty formal education. ''I doubt if it be a true advantage for a boy to be first at a prep school, however good, that is run by a cousin of his mother,'' recalled Dorothea Butterworth, his elder sister. ''And then at a public school house run by family friends who encourage him to work or pass time in their own private garden.''</p>
        <p>Women played a crucial role in Ionides's life, none more so than his wife, Nellie Samuel Levy. A friend of Queen Mary, she had already amassed considerable objets d'art by the time she married the designer, her second husband, in 1930: Canton enamel snuff boxes, English chinoiserie silver, 18th-century etchings of the Thames (she also had a charming weakness for tapestries and paintings depicting poodles).</p>
        <p>When they met, Ionides already had a couple of houses stuffed with antique ceramics. Not surprisingly, it was art that brought the couple together. The 40-something widowed philanthropist and Ionides, a slightly younger bachelor who lived with his mother, were introduced by Margaret Jourdain, an expert on Georgian furniture, who recommended Ionides to decorate Nellie Levy's London house at 49 Berkeley Square West.</p>
        <p>Though impressed by his new client's taste, Ionides was not unmindful of her financial attributes. She marched to the altar fully loaded with a fortune derived from Shell Oil, which was founded by her father, Marcus Samuel, one of the first British Jews to receive a peerage. The money was an asset of which her husband was immodestly proud. James Lees-Milne, an adviser to the National Trust, visited Bux ted Park, the couple's storied country house in Sussex, in the 1940's and was astonished to hear the designer -- ''pleasant, jolly, bon viveur, large and well-fed,'' he recorded in his diary that evening -- confide that Nellie Ionides's estate would be worth more than two million pounds after her death. Unfortunately for her husband, the Hon. Mrs. Ionides outlived him by more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Ionides transformed the Berkeley Square house into a private museum. Nellie's hundreds of Battersea enamels -- plaques, candlesticks, boxes -- were stored in a round vaulted room lined with glass-fronted cabinets of stripped-down neo-Classical design. In the next room went a horde of porcelains, arranged on open floor-to-ceiling shelves. A 1938 photograph of the connecting spaces shows in the background, propped on a shelf, the dish that will be on display. Whether it was originally his purchase or hers is unknown.</p>
        <p>The Berkeley Square interiors were an exceptional tribute to Basil Ionides's discerning eye and Nellie Ionides's fortune, as was Buxted Park (now a hotel). Both houses have long since changed hands, but the handsome Kangxi dish that graced them remains: mute witness to the glory that can spark when two people with complementary minds are joined as one.</p>
