        <p>Q: What happens when those who live in a condominium pay extra common charges for owners who do not pay their way? Over a period of 15 or 30 years, a $250 a month additional fee adds up to a hefty sum.  Those of us who do pay our share actually wind up paying for those who do not. When this money is recovered at the time of sale because of liens placed on the apartment by the condominium association, do we get reimbursed? What if we move out before the delinquent homeowner sells? Is the board obligated to find us and reimburse us? . . . Jeff Shermer, Plainview, N.Y.  A: Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that a condo unit's common charges are usually based on that unit's percentage interest in the condominium. If one or more of the owners do not pay their common charges, he said, the board has the right to divide the resulting shortfall among the paying unit owners in the form of higher common charges.</p>

        <p>Q: What happens when those who live in a condominium pay extra common charges for owners who do not pay their way? Over a period of 15 or 30 years, a $250 a month additional fee adds up to a hefty sum.  Those of us who do pay our share actually wind up paying for those who do not. When this money is recovered at the time of sale because of liens placed on the apartment by the condominium association, do we get reimbursed? What if we move out before the delinquent homeowner sells? Is the board obligated to find us and reimburse us? . . . Jeff Shermer, Plainview, N.Y.  A: Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that a condo unit's common charges are usually based on that unit's percentage interest in the condominium. If one or more of the owners do not pay their common charges, he said, the board has the right to divide the resulting shortfall among the paying unit owners in the form of higher common charges.</p>
        <p>''If the condominium recovers the shortfall from the delinquent owners, the condominium's cash needs will be reduced and the unit owners will indirectly recover the extra amount laid out for the delinquent owners,'' Mr. Weinstein said.</p>
        <p>He said that the letter writer is correct in pointing out that if he moves from the building before the money is recovered he will not receive the benefits. At the same time, however, he said, it is possible that the letter writer is now enjoying the benefits of recovered delinquencies that were paid for by former owners of his apartment.</p>
        <p>It is possible for the board to establish a policy that will ensure that those who contributed to a delinquent owner's shortfall will be repaid.  ''You could suggest to the board that the problem be solved by an agreement among all unit owners that provides that shortfalls be funded by loans to the condominium from each unit owner,'' Mr. Weinstein said.  ''Those loans would then be repaid to each unit owner when the arrearages are recovered.''</p>
        <p>However, he said, this would be an awkward way to handle the problem, and he would generally recommend against it. ''Arranging for loans would require the agreement of all unit owners,'' he said. ''And since the condominium's lien for unpaid common charges is secondary to any unpaid bank loans secured by the defaulting owner's apartment, it is by no means certain that the condominium will recover the shortfall.''</p>
        <p>And that, he said, could result in the loans from unit owners remaining on the books of the condo forever.</p>
        <p>Painting Apartment That's Stabilized</p>
        <p>Q: Our building's new owner has discontinued the previous owner's practice of having rent-stabilized apartments painted every three years. A month ago, I sent a certified letter to the new owner requesting a new paint job, and the response has been stony silence. Would the easiest resolution be for me to hire a painter and deduct the cost from my rent? . . . Mel Schechter, Manhattan.  A: Fred L. Seeman, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that while the Rent Stabilization Law does not require landlords to paint tenants' apartments, the New York City Housing Maintenance Code requires a landlord to paint a tenant's apartment once every three years.</p>
        <p>''Armed with the knowledge that the new owner is in violation of the Housing Maintenance Code, the tenant should complete the paper trail he has already begun,'' Mr. Seeman said.</p>
        <p>He explained that the tenant should send another certified letter to the new owner pointing out that the owner's continued failure to paint the apartment is a violation of the Housing Maintenance Code.</p>
        <p>The letter should put the owner on notice that if he fails to paint the apartment, the tenant will have no choice but to have the apartment repainted in a similar color scheme and then deduct the cost of the repainting from the rent.</p>
        <p>If the landlord then takes the tenant to court, Mr. Seeman said, the tenant can produce the letters and the bill for the painting as a legal defense.</p>
