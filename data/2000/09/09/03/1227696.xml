        <p>Washington lobbyists, shod in tasseled loafers, once inspired someone to describe their eager, sartorially enhanced gatherings outside the closed doors of Congressional hearing rooms as Gucci Gulch. Now they have their own watering hole, the Caucus Room, and the list of investors is top heavy with a who's who of lobbyocracy.</p>
        <p>Which is why it has more private dining rooms than any other Washington restaurant. Thomas H. Boggs Jr., one of its largest investors and one of the town's best-known lobbyists (his father, Hale, was a Democratic speaker of the House, his mother, Lindy, a former congresswoman from Louisiana and now ambassador to the Vatican), provided a simple explanation. So many closed doors, he said, make it possible to keep people like Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, a Republican, and Richard A. Gephardt, the minority leader of the House, a Democrat, from running into each other during fund-raising events. Not so incidentally, lobbyists can deduct as much of their visits as business expenses as possible -- 100 percent for a banquet, but only 50 percent for a regular meal.</p>

        <p>The roster of the Caucus Room's 65 shareholders includes Michael Brown, the son of the former Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, as well as James Lake, the deputy campaign manager for the 1992 Bush campaign. It practically guarantees a full house nightly. And if political junkies watch the comings and goings of the private dining rooms carefully, they might just be able to figure out the behind-the-scene machinations that make Washington tick.</p>
        <p>In a town where politics has become a very nasty business, the lobbyists have put aside their differences and come together in one of their few bipartisan efforts, offering a culinary venue that fairly sizzles with accommodation -- a steakhouse.</p>
