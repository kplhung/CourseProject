        <p>On Tuesday afternoon, visibly tired after an 11-hour flight from Cairo and still focused on the Middle East, President Clinton met at the White House with two of his closest advisers to hear Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen appeal one last time for making the bold decision to build a national missile defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen, speaking forthrightly and matter-of-factly, conceded that technological hurdles remained, and that the Pentagon's schedule for completing a system by 2005 had become no more than a hope. ''Still,'' a senior defense official said, ''he felt we should proceed with construction,'' to give Mr. Clinton's successor a head start.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton left the meeting without declaring his intentions, but by then the outcome was a formality, administration officials now say. The foundation for the decision he announced Friday in a hastily arranged speech at Georgetown University had in fact been laid months before, several senior administration and Pentagon officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's decision not to authorize even initial construction of a national missile shield had been shaped by events as far back as January, these officials said, when the Russians first made it clear they would not negotiate changes in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.</p>
        <p>The administration's calculated plan for making a decision about a limited missile shield in the election year 2000 -- drafted in part as political defense of Vice President Al Gore in his campaign for the presidency -- had begun to unravel even before it got very far. And it did so because of events that were largely out of the administration's control.</p>
        <p>The startling diplomatic opening of Kim Jong Il of North Korea, culminating in a summit meeting with his South Korean counterpart in June, gave support to critics of the missile system that the threat of a rogue attack had been overstated. And the spectacular failure of the Pentagon's test of its high-speed missile interceptor in July left insurmountable doubts about the technology.</p>
        <p>Most important, however, the administration could not predict domestic politics in Russia. The administration's plan rested on negotiating a deal with Moscow to allow construction of a limited missile shield without scrapping the Antiballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
        <p>That treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union, and viewed by some as the cornerstone of cold-war arms control, sought to prevent nuclear war by forcing Washington and Moscow to remain equally vulnerable to the other's attack.</p>
        <p>But any chance of a deal disintegrated along with the political fortunes of the man on whom this strategy depended, Boris N. Yeltsin, who was viewed by American negotiators as more pliable than his successor, Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>''I believe that when Boris Yeltsin was president, there was a decent chance of getting the deal we wanted in the course of this year,'' a senior administration official said. ''When Putin came in, that changed. Putin is, among other things, the un-Boris.''</p>
        <p>With each of these events, support  for building a missile defense withered. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was so unenthusiastic she virtually dropped out of the debate, leaving the issue to her deputy, Strobe Talbott, administration officials said. Opposition had so hardened at the White House and State Department that officials at the National Security Council were said to have expressed quiet relief when the test failed in July.</p>
        <p>''It was a joke over here that they were burning incense at the N.S.C. before the test, hoping it would fail,'' a senior Pentagon official said.</p>
        <p>In the end it was Mr. Cohen, the sole Republican in the president's cabinet, who continued to advocate sticking to the timetable the administration had drafted -- long after all of Mr. Clinton's other senior advisers had concluded that to do so would be a technological leap of faith and a diplomatic disaster.</p>
        <p>Even the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had almost no role in the debate or the decision, showed little enthusiasm, Pentagon officials said, believing that protecting against shorter-range missiles capable of hitting American troops overseas was the more pressing concern. They were especially worried, these officials said, that an expensive missile defense would drain dollars from conventional forces.</p>
        <p>Several administration officials said that Mr. Cohen's hold-out position created the most striking schism among Mr. Clinton's foreign policy advisers, who pride themselves on public unity and keeping disagreements to themselves.</p>
        <p>The ''ABC team'' -- the administration's alphabetical shorthand for Ms. Albright, Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, and Mr. Cohen -- had previously never failed to reach consensus on a significant issue before submitting it to Mr. Clinton. The only other time one official could recall Mr. Cohen being overruled was when he argued against imposing sanctions on Myanmar in 1996.</p>
        <p>''This has been one of the more divisive issues in the defense establishment, in the arms control community and in the administration,'' said a senior official who was immersed in the debates.</p>
        <p>In the hours after Mr. Clinton made his announcement on Friday, Mr. Cohen did not appear in public to explain his views. He simply released a curt statement that, at least indirectly, made his zeal for pursuing missile defense clear.</p>
        <p>''I have noted on many occasions that several emerging threats warrant the deployment of an effective missile defense program as soon as technologically feasible,'' he said.</p>
        <p>From the beginning, President Clinton's actions signaled that he was an unenthusiastic supporter of a national missile defense. In 1993 he scaled back what remnants were left of the research that Ronald Reagan had begun on a Star Wars defense against the threat of ballistic missiles.</p>
        <p>By 1998, however, the debate over limited missile defenses intensified. A committee heavily weighted with Republicans and led by Donald H. Rumsfeld, who served as secretary of defense under President Gerald R. Ford, reported that the threat of ballistic missiles from countries like North Korea, Iran or Iraq was no longer a distant one.</p>
        <p>A month later, as if to prove the point, North Korea fired a Taepodong missile, capped by a satellite, over Japan. The test was a failure, but the debris landed in the Pacific Ocean not far from Alaska.</p>
        <p>It was clear early on that Mr. Cohen was going to be the administration's most ardent supporter of building a limited defensive shield to counter the emerging threat.</p>
        <p>In January 1999, when the administration announced that it would spend $6.7 billion to develop and test a system, Mr. Cohen bluntly warned that the United States was prepared to unilaterally withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty if the Russians did not agree to amend it.</p>
        <p>Officials at the State Department and the White House quickly disavowed his warning, but planning went ahead. And the Pentagon devised a schedule for testing a missile interceptor that, guided by sophisticated radar stations on the ground and satellites in space, would crash into incoming ballistic missiles before they reached American soil.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Clinton's timetable on missile defense reflected a desire in part to protect Vice President Gore from Republican attacks that a Democratic White House was weak on defense, officials conceded. Republicans had hammered Mr. Clinton for not backing a missile shield, so he took a middle course that would proceed with tests while trying to preserve arms control agreements.</p>
        <p>By last fall, the administration agreed that Mr. Clinton would make a decision on whether to deploy the system this summer -- at the height of the presidential campaign -- based on four criteria: the system's cost, its technological feasibility, the missile threat and the impact on national security, particularly on arms control.</p>
        <p>The last criteria was key, because President Clinton agreed with senior State Department officials and arms control advocates that the ABM Treaty was a cornerstone of arms control. Its prohibitions against a national missile defense allowed the United States and Russia to reduce offensive nuclear weapons without  losing their strategic deterrence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton made it clear that he would approve a system only if the administration could reach agreement with the Russians to amend the treaty, officials said. But any hope of that was dashed on New Year's Eve when President Yeltsin, who had shown considerable flexibility in dealings with the administration, announced that he was stepping down and named Mr. Putin as his successor.</p>
        <p>With the Americans proposing to build a missile defense that many Russians saw as a threat to their last claim to superpower status, Mr. Putin drew the line. ''He was going to make sure the Russian people understood he wasn't going to roll over for stuff,'' one administration official said.</p>
        <p>By last January, Mr. Putin's tougher stance was already clear. The State Department's chief arms control negotiator, John D. Holum, presented the Russians with a proposal for amending the treaty, while assuring them the system was so limited that Russia's nuclear arsenal could easily overwhelm it -- thus, in the logic of arms control, preserving strategic stability.</p>
        <p>The Russians brushed aside the proposal, refusing to call the talks ''negotiations,'' referring to them merely as ''discussions.'' Mr. Holum, Mr. Talbott and other officials continued ''discussions'' with the Russians through the spring.</p>
        <p>The Russians never flatly ruled out the possibility of negotiating amendments -- ''Putin never said nyet,'' the senior official recalled -- but after he was elected president in March, he began a campaign against the American proposals, driving a  wedge between the United States and its NATO allies.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Clinton met with Mr. Putin in Moscow in June, American officials said they had made considerable progress toward enhancing strategic cooperation and security, but the two leaders barely discussed missile defense.</p>
        <p>There was never any question that Mr. Clinton would actually move ahead unilaterally, as Mr. Cohen had suggested in 1999. ''He didn't want to be the president that killed the ABM Treaty,'' one official said.</p>
        <p>Instead, the White House asked the administration's lawyers to see if there was a way that initial work on a defensive shield could begin -- starting with a sophisticated radar at Shemya Island in Alaska -- without technically violating the treaty.</p>
        <p>The lawyers came up with three opinions, but even those proved divisive. On July 25, Mr. Cohen appeared before the Senate and said the lawyers had reached a consensus that workers could pour concrete and lay the rails that would support the radar itself. Such an interpretation would allow work to continue until 2002, before the United States would have to notify the Russians of its intent to withdraw from the treaty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen was simply voicing his support for the most liberal interpretation. There was no consensus, and senior officials at the State Department and the National Security Council complained that Mr. Cohen's position was overly aggressive and certain to inflame tensions with Russia and the allies.</p>
        <p>All the while, the Pentagon and Mr. Cohen pushed ahead with a testing schedule that even some in the military considered overly compressed and risky. But the Pentagon's efforts, too, suffered setbacks.</p>
        <p>After having a successful test in October 1999, proving that it was possible ''to hit a bullet with a bullet,'' as Mr. Clinton said on Friday, another test in January failed. That put even more pressure on the test this past July 7, since the administration had said it would have to have two successful intercepts before it could approve the program.</p>
        <p>On the night of the July 7, the interceptor lifted off a launch pad in Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands and streaked toward a dummy missile fired from California. But the interceptor's booster rocket failed to separate.</p>
        <p>''After that test failed, it pretty much confirmed that the deployment would be kicked back,'' a senior defense official said. ''We lost the momentum.''</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Cohen and a small circle of aides pressed ahead. They noted that while the test had failed, other parts of the system, including the ground-based radar, had worked.</p>
        <p>By late July, however, Mr. Cohen was alone in making the case that the system was at least technologically feasible. At the White House and the State Department, officials had concluded that the system was nowhere near ready, and meetings to discuss the issue became increasingly tense.</p>
        <p>''We saw the glass as half full,'' a senior Pentagon official said, ''and they kept saying it was half empty.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen first delivered his recommendation to the president more than a week ago, before Mr. Clinton's trip to Nigeria, Tanzania and Egypt. Administration officials said he had argued that contractors should begin work on the radar station in Shemya, Alaska, leaving open the possibility of completing a system at the earliest possible date should the next president -- either Mr. Gore or George W. Bush -- choose to do so.</p>
        <p>At no time, officials said, did Mr. Cohen betray his loyalty to the Democratic president, whose aides value at least the appearance of interagency harmony. ''I think Bill Cohen has been a total mensch about this at every stage,'' one senior official said, with the grace of a victor toward a vanquished foe.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Cohen met at the White House on Tuesday with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Berger and the president's chief of staff, John Podesta, the president's mind was made up.</p>
        <p>In the weeks before announcing his decision, Mr. Clinton had been reading a book by the historian Frances FitzGerald, ''Way Out There in the Blue: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War,'' visitors to the Oval Office said. The book provides a sharp critique of the Reagan administration's advocacy of a Star Wars defense, chronicling the wrenching internal debates that went on in the 1980's among the State Department, the Pentagon and the National Security Council.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton told several aides that his administration's debate over one of the most significant issues in foreign affairs and defense policy of the time seemed orderly by contrast.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 4, 2000, Monday  An article yesterday about the origin of President Clinton's deferral of a decision on a national missile defense system misstated the date of the only previous instance an official could recall in which Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen was overruled within the administration's foreign policy team. That instance -- in which he argued against imposing sanctions on Myanmar -- occurred in 1997, not 1996.</p>
