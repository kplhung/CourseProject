        <p>FUSION 4, METROSTARS 1</p>
        <p>Now the MetroStars find out how much goalkeeping depth they have. After last night's 4-1 loss to the Miami Fusion in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the MetroStars, Major League Soccer's Eastern Division champions, are down to a pair of obscure goalkeepers to choose from with the playoffs coming into view.</p>
        <p>Tim Howard, last night's starter, is off to join the United States Olympic team, and the regular goalkeeper, Mike Ammann, is out with three broken ribs and a punctured lung.</p>
        <p>According to General Manager Nick Sakiewicz, the competition is between Russell Payne, who played for the Boston Bulldogs until becoming Howard's backup after Ammann was hurt Aug. 16, and Paul Grafer, who has played for the first-place Long Island Rough Riders in the A-League's Northeast Division.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars lost last night when Miami's Diego Serna scored a team-record four goals. With a rematch looming against Miami at Giants Stadium on Tuesday, Sakiewicz said the starting goalkeeper would be determined at practice tonight. Grafer, who is 15-8-3 with a 1.27 goals-against record for the Rough Riders, appears to have the edge.</p>
        <p>Last night the MetroStars fell behind on two goals by Serna within the first two minutes. Forward Alex Comas countered on a penalty kick in the 45th minute, but another pair of goals by Serna in the second half turned the game into a rout.</p>
        <p>''We didn't look like a team fighting for something,'' Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ''We played without purpose. Obviously we have several players who feel they have already accomplished something this season and we basically just went through the motions out there.''</p>
