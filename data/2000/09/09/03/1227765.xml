      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says local governments, corporations and individuals across country are withdrawing their support of Boy Scouts in response to Scouts' defense of its right to discriminate against homosexuals; says children cannot learn about honor from organization that views homosexuality as moral defect; says extended Boy Scout family needs to save organization from its present self-destructive and discriminatory course</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Boy Scouts of America turned to the United States Supreme Court earlier this year to protect its constitutional right, under the freedom of association, to exclude gays from its membership. The Boy Scouts asserted that barring gays was fundamental to its mission. But now, as local governments, corporations and individuals across the country withdraw their support from the Boy Scouts in response to this exclusionary policy, it is obviously time for the organization to reconsider its stance.  The Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., it is worth noting, does not discriminate against gays.</p>
        <p>The swift reaction of public authorities to the Scouts' defense of its right to discriminate has been heartening. Prodded by local anti-discrimination laws, Chicago, San Francisco and many smaller communities have revoked the Boy Scouts' access to public facilities such as schools and campgrounds. This is especially appropriate where such access was granted on preferential terms. In San Diego, for instance, the American Civil Liberties Union is right to challenge the city for leasing 18 acres of parkland to the Scouts for one dollar a year.  Despite the Boy Scouts' laudable role in the lives of millions of boys for almost a century, taxpayers cannot be in a position of bankrolling its activities so long as gays are excluded.</p>

        <p>The negative responses to the Boy Scouts' position are not yet a widespread, grass-roots movement, as evidenced by the Scouts' growing membership. But the organization is losing some significant and high-profile financial backing. Donors as varied as Chase Manhattan Bank and some United Way chapters have exercised their own freedom of association by ceasing to support the Scouts.</p>
        <p>Withholding support cannot be an easy decision. But the organization needs to realize that a growing number of donors will question its claim to belong on the center stage of American life if it continues asserting a discriminatory philosophy. In today's world, children cannot learn about honor from an organization that views homosexuality as a moral defect.</p>
        <p>In some areas, parents and local council leaders are mobilizing to change the national leadership's policy banning homosexuals. There is much to be admired about the Boy Scouts tradition and much that is worth preserving. But the extended Boy Scout family needs to save the organization from its present self-destructive and discriminatory course.</p>
