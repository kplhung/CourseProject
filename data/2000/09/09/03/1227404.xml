        <p>DAVID THEWLIS'S character Johnny in NAKED (1993) isnot easy to be around. As Vincent Canby wrote in his original New York Times review of the film, this is a man about ''as capable of expressing love as Jack the Ripper.'' Johnny is an angry, scruffy 27-year-old from Manchester, homeless in London, and people keep inviting him in, especially women. To whom he is not nice. But he's a great talker, he has some interesting observations (that the bar code is literally a sign of the Apocalypse, for instance), and eventually his pain and his journey begin to look like a microcosm of something all too familiar. This is an ugly film; it's also the director, Mike Leigh, at his best - Friday at 10:30 p.m. on IFC.</p>

        <p>Try to block out Pat Boone's rendition of the theme song, which sets the wrong tone entirely. The rest of William Wyler's FRIENDLY PERSUASION (1956) is homespun perfection, the kind of film that used to give Americana a good name. Gary Cooper and Dorothy McGuire seem genuinely in love as a Quaker couple in Indiana trying to uphold their religion's creed of nonviolence while the Civil War comes closer and closer to their hearth. The young Anthony Perkins is excellent, too, as their elder son, who believes that there are times when taking up arms is justified. He will have a chance to prove that - Wednesday at 4:30 and 10 p.m., Wednesday/Early Thursday at 4:45 a.m.</p>
        <p>As a World War II movie made during the war years, A WALK IN THE SUN (1945) is an anomaly. For one thing, it's mostly talk; the combat scenes come and go in the blink of an eye. For another, its clear-eyed look at individual fear didn't turn up in many war-is-glory films of the period. Every time Richard Conte's character shouts, ''Nobody dies!'' it's an order of sorts, a lucky charm and a prayer. Some of the devices for exposition seem a little hokey now (John Ireland's writing letters in his head aloud, the music's heavily narrative lyrics), but the film's overcome those problems. Dana Andrews, Sterling Holloway and Lloyd Bridges are part of the terrific ensemble cast. Robert Rossen wrote the very literate script, and Lewis Milestone, who also did ''All Quiet on the Western Front,'' directed - Sunday at 1 p.m. on CUNY.</p>
        <p>Everything about CHARADE (1963) is stylist: its stars (Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant), its setting (Paris), its music (by Henry Mancini) and its direction (by Stanley Donen, even though it's Hitchcockian in every way). The unexpected bonus is that its script, by Peter Stone, is outstanding too. The film is a comedy thriller about a young widow, a lot of money stolen by her husband and all the people who are out to get it - Friday at midnight on Channel 21.</p>
        <p>Since the moment YOU'VE GOT MAIL (1998) opened, people have been comparing it unfavorably with ''Sleepless in Seattle,'' the first movie from the team of Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and their director, Nora Ephron. It's true that the trio didn't create real magic this time around. But the film, an update of ''The Shop Around the Corner,'' is a real charmer in its own way. The premise is that a couple of attractive, successful New Yorkers fall in love by e-mail, not knowing that they're bitter enemies in real life. And as anyone who lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan can tell you, it makes the neighborhood look like Camelot - Sunday at 3 p.m. and Thursday at 1 p.m.</p>
