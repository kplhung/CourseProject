        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>My grandchildren (ages 1, 3 and 4) were visiting me last summer in Deal. When I went into the bathroom, 4-year-old Emily followed me right in.</p>
        <p>''I need some privacy, Emily,'' I said.</p>
        <p>With that, she followed me and said, ''O.K. grandma, I'll just close the door.''</p>
        <p>Later that day we went to our beach club, and after retrieving the children from the pool, we headed to the restaurant there. When the manager saw us, he stopped one of my  grandsons and said, ''Little boy, you can't go in there with a wet suit.''</p>
        <p>Stefan looked up at him innocently and said, ''No?''</p>
        <p>''No, you can't,'' the gentleman replied.</p>
        <p>Stefan simply turned around and proceeded to take off his bathing trunks. Problem solved.</p>

        <p>Scene: Denville's municipal playground.</p>
        <p>There are two little boys and one empty swing. Both boys run to claim it, and a tussle ensues. The mothers separate the combatants and one mother delivers a stern warning: ''I want you guys to settle this fair and square.''</p>
        <p>And then came the heartfelt reply: ''Geez, mom. We were settling it before you stepped in.''</p>
        <p>Audrey Corn  THE ESSENTIAL EVE</p>
        <p>The best things in life may be free.</p>
        <p>Admitting I'm on the defensive,</p>
        <p>I think you'll be apt to agree</p>
        <p>The second-best things are expensive.</p>

        <p>A bumper sticker seen on a black sport utility vehicle on Route 46 in Pine Brook: ''Be kind to animals, hug a hockey player.''</p>
        <p>Doris L. Meyer</p>
        <p>Scene: The Dunkin Donuts in Glen Rock around 3 p.m., between intermittent downpours and constant sprinkles.</p>
        <p>I was doubling up on my daily dosage of caffeine when another mother stepped in line and asked, ''So what have you been doing with your five kids these last two weeks to stay sane and dry?''</p>
        <p>I grabbed my liquid ammunition and replied, ''We wrote our Christmas lists.''</p>
        <p>She gazed at me in amazement -- along with a touch of disdain -- and replied: ''Well, aren't you the organized one? I guess desperate times calls for desperate measures.''</p>
        <p>Then jokingly, she asked, ''What did you ask Santa for?''</p>
        <p>''The first day of school,'' I replied with a Grinch-like grin.''</p>
        <p>Deirdre Flanagan Ward  A LABOR DAY POEM</p>
        <p>I love the lights of Paris and</p>
        <p>I love the lights of Rome,</p>
        <p>but the lights that I love best</p>
        <p>are the tail lights headed home.</p>
        <p>John T. Stone</p>
        <p>LABOR DAY (Redux)</p>
        <p>Arrivederci, summer.</p>
        <p>Alas, it's Labor Day.</p>
        <p>From now on, life's a bummer</p>
        <p>Until the end of May.</p>
        <p>Duty we can't say no to</p>
        <p>With whom we rendezvous.</p>
        <p>There's school that we must go to</p>
        <p>Or office chores to do.</p>
        <p>Though we'll miss the swimming/ sunning,</p>
        <p>It is really for the best.</p>
        <p>After three months' frantic running</p>
        <p>We can use nine months of rest.</p>
