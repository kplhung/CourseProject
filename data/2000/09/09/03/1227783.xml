        <p>Lebanon is slipping toward a constitutional crisis -- and a tough early test for Syria's new young leader, Bashar al-Assad -- as it goes into a final round of parliamentary elections on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Rafik Hariri, the flamboyant multibillionaire real estate developer, appears poised to roll up a majority in the 128-seat Parliament, probably 70 seats or more, in his effort to come back as prime minister.</p>
        <p>But President Emile Lahoud, annointed by Syria, which for a decade has been the only real political power here, appears determined, somehow, to block Mr. Hariri from regaining the office he held from 1992 to 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hariri threw up showy projects, including rebuilding the downtown devastated by the 15-year civil war, but Mr. Lahoud has accused him of plunging the country into debt and corruption.</p>
        <p>The government took a terrific blow in the first round of elections last Sunday in the far north, the Christian heartland, and the Druz mountains, with final tallies showing 41 of the 63 seats going to government critics or candidates allied with Mr. Hariri. Riding a wave of economic discontent, the tycoon has built an imposing set of alliances for the vote Sunday in Beirut, the south and the Bekaa region.</p>
        <p>Winding up with a series of packed, emotional street rallies, Mr. Hariri exuded confidence this morning in his huge, ornate palace, as aides and candidates on his ticket scurried about.</p>
        <p>''The polls are good,'' he said. ''Tomorrow we will see if they are right. The battle is for Beirut.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, President Lahoud's main political ally, Michel Murr, the powerful interior minister, says no matter how many votes and how much parliamentary support Mr. Hariri gets, he is not coming back.</p>
        <p>''Hariri may have become the Gamal Abdel Nasser of the Sunni Muslim sect, and he may be able to sweep Beirut in the elections, but this will not bring him closer to the Grand Serai,'' he said, referring to the huge stone building that houses the prime minister's office.</p>
        <p>''On the contrary, this will push him much farther from the premiership,'' Mr. Murr was quoted by the newspaper As Safir as having told visitors after last week's voting.</p>
        <p>''Even the support of 70 Parliament members will not be enough to get Hariri to the prime ministry slot, because everyone knows how a prime minister is manufactured in Lebanon,'' he went on.</p>
        <p>''The basic element in this process is a consensus between Syria and the president about the new prime minister. It seems that many are not fully aware of the depth of the strategic relationship that exists between President Emile Lahoud and President Bashar Assad.''</p>
        <p>On paper, at least, it would seem difficult to deny Mr. Hariri the office. Under the Constitution and the 1989 Taif agreement -- brokered by the United States, Saudi Arabia and Syria to end the bloody sectarian war -- the president must be a Maronite Catholic and his prime minister a Sunni Moslem, to be named after binding talks with Parliament.</p>
        <p>In practice, this usually means a number of hopefuls might assemble blocks of supporters, and Syria would weigh in, using its influence over Lebanese politicians to assemble a simple majority for its candidate. In the departing Parliament, Mr. Hariri had only a 14-member bloc and about 10 additional sympathizers.</p>
        <p>But the rules are often flexible.</p>
        <p>The impasse is the first major problem for Mr. Assad, a mild-mannered 34-year-old eye doctor and computer enthusiast who inherited leadership of Syria, along with the rank of lieutenant general and commander of the army, upon the death in June of his father, Hafez al-Assad, who had run both countries with ruthless skill.</p>
        <p>And it is a particularly difficult impasse. Two years ago, the younger Mr. Assad was given responsibility over Lebanon as part of his training to assume leadership.</p>
        <p>In his first exercise of power, he selected Mr. Lahoud, a military commander with no political base, to be president. This also, in effect, meant firing Mr. Hariri, who was detested by Mr. Lahoud but was a favorite of the Syrian officials who had been in charge of Lebanon: the longtime vice president, Abdul Halim Khaddam, and a military intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Ghazi Kanaan.</p>
        <p>For a week, the top-ranking Lebanese politicians have been trooping to Damascus to meet with Mr. Assad, as they had so often before been summoned by his father.</p>
        <p>But the signals from Syria were far from clear. Some Beirut newspapers have reported that Damascus wanted no further electoral embarrassment to its loyal supporter, President Lahoud.</p>
        <p>At the same time, however, the speaker of Parliament, Nabih Berri, leader of the Shiite Muslim Amal movement, who is noted for being acutely responsive to Syrian desires, returned from Damascus, stopping off to see General Kanaan at Syrian intelligence headquarters in the Bekaa region, and promptly announced that his joint Amal-Hezbollah ticket in the south would join in alliance with Mr. Hariri.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hariri's forces are contesting 18 of the 19 seats in three districts in Beirut, the main battleground on Sunday, each reserved for a specific religious sect. Mr. Berri's 23 candidates on the Amal-Hezbollah ticket are expected to sweep the south, which was freed in May from more than 20 years of Israeli occupation, and Mr. Hariri should pick up a dozen or so Christian seats in the Bekaa and other places.</p>
        <p>While political alliances in Lebanon are often fragile and shifting, sometimes in bloody ways, the current situation represents a major change. Broadly speaking, usually contending religious groups -- the basic political division here -- have been brought into an unusual alliance against the government.</p>
        <p>Most notably, Walid Jumblatt, hereditary chieftain of the Druse, an offshoot of Islam, and a major ally of Mr. Hariri, has reached across the old civil war lines to befriend his former enemies on the Christian right.</p>
        <p>Among them are former President Amin Gemeyal; Dori Chamoun, survivor of a leading Maronite family in the Chouf mountains with whom Mr. Jumblatt had battled; the supporters of the exiled former army general, Michel Aoun, who fought the last clash with the Syrians; and even the Christian warlord Samir Geagea, who has been jailed on multiple murder charges.</p>
        <p>And there are even hints, until now unspeakable, of challenges to Syria's long domination. In a three-hour television interview the other night, Mr. Jumblatt said he was calling for ''a correction of the relationship with Syria to be re-established on a balanced basis.''</p>
