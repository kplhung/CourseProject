        <p>FISHIEST of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserves its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowder,'' reports Ishmael, the sea-faring narrator in 'Moby Dick'. ''Chowder for breakfast, chowder for dinner, chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.''</p>
        <p>Today landlubbers are inclined to look more favorably upon what was once a sailor's lamentable staple. All good seafood restaurants keep a chowder recipe in the kitchen, and trot them out at certain times of the year. ''I'd bring it in in the fall and stay away from it in the summer,'' notes Jim Zalewski, 47, the chef-owner of Kipper'z Restaurant in Avalon, where the menu usually carries a seafood bisque. ''But who knows? Some people might come down for the seafood experience and go all the way.''</p>

        <p>FISHIEST of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserves its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowder,'' reports Ishmael, the sea-faring narrator in 'Moby Dick'. ''Chowder for breakfast, chowder for dinner, chowder for supper, till you began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.''</p>
        <p>Today landlubbers are inclined to look more favorably upon what was once a sailor's lamentable staple. All good seafood restaurants keep a chowder recipe in the kitchen, and trot them out at certain times of the year. ''I'd bring it in in the fall and stay away from it in the summer,'' notes Jim Zalewski, 47, the chef-owner of Kipper'z Restaurant in Avalon, where the menu usually carries a seafood bisque. ''But who knows? Some people might come down for the seafood experience and go all the way.''</p>
        <p>Chock-full of clams or fish, chowder is more stew than soup. It is a hearty weapon against hunger or sudden chill in the weather.</p>
        <p>And each year in the town of Avalon, in the closing weeks of summer, potsful of chowder become weapons of war, wielded by chefs duking it out in the great Chowder Cookoff. The event is one of many that occur during the Wings 'n' Water Festival, a two-day arts festival sponsored by the Wetlands Institute, a non-profit organization that promotes appreciation and understanding of coastal habitats.</p>
        <p>This year six different shore restaurants have gotten their chefs involved in the cookoff. The instructions are simple: Rustle up five gallons of your best chowder, get it to Avalon Community Hall piping hot and keep your fingers crossed. Fairgoers pay $2 each to sample all of the chowders each of the chowders, voting at the end of their sampling. The winner becomes the reigning King of Clams.</p>
        <p>Last year, that honor went to Brian Heenan, who confessed that he once binged with a buddy in Newport, R. I., hitting every seafood place in that resort town, slurping chowder for their own private taste test. ''I love clam chowder,'' said Mr. Heenan, 46, who has manned the kitchen at the Windrift Restaurant in Avalon for the last 17 years. ''It's like a staple of my diet. This year I'll be entering the same recipe I used last year. It's what I like. It has the taste and consistency I like, so I wouldn't change anything.''</p>
        <p>Apparently, that's the way true chowderheads prefer it. The rules stipulate that chefs whip up a New England clam chowder. A chef who gets a little creative -- tossing in ingredients like salmon and red bliss potatoes, mussels, or diced Jersey tomatoes -- is not disqualified, per se, but tends not to garner the winning votes.</p>
        <p>Chowder originated as the Everyman's meal, the sort of dish working shipwrights and fishermen pulled together on the docks or even at sea, using whatever was in their larder. The word chowder is said to come from the French word for cauldron, chaudron or chautiere. Sailors used fish, or parts of fish, as the basis for their rich stew.</p>
        <p>Today we use potatoes, cream and butter to thicken up the soup. In the old days, it was crumbled sea biscuits. The modern dish's thickness is a remnant of those days, when chowder must have tasted more like a thick pudding than a soup.</p>
        <p>Ishmael waxed poetic on the ingredients: ''Oh! sweet friends, hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuits and salted pork cut up into little flakes! the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.''</p>
        <p>The record shows he did not become nearly that enthusiastic about Ahab, or the Great White Whale.</p>
        <p>Today's chefs still sweat the details.</p>
        <p>''People get hung up on their chowders,'' said Mark Kalla, 41, a chef working his first year at the Anchorage Avalon Marina. ''There are no real secrets. You have to use good ingredients.''</p>
        <p>That means starting with a nice bunch of clams, preferably Jersey clams. Though trucks rumble through daily from fish markets in Philadelphia, some chefs prefer to buy the catch of local fishermen. ''The fishermen who dock right in our own marina are very nice,'' said Mr. Kalla. ''And I can get fish that's been caught today, whereas it would take three days to before it comes from Philly.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know what it is about the local clams,'' said Robert Tyndall, 30, chef-owner of the upscale Cafe Loren in Avalon. ''They're sweeter in this area, that's for sure.''</p>
        <p>When the bushels show up, chefs steam the catch, chop up the meaty insides, and reserve the precious liquor, or juice, to flavor their stocks. Ronald Brown, 29, who works at Henny's Driftwood Dining Room, a Stone Harbor institution for nearly 70 years, makes clam chowder fresh every day -- even on those sweltering summer days when your stomach craves it least. His standing order: about 325 clams a day. Definitely not a home kitchen operation.</p>
        <p>Even if a home chef were to make the soup from scratch, he or she would probably eschew all those cast-off shells and pry open a can of clams instead. And that's the difference between an okay chowder and a meal fit for Neptune.</p>
        <p>''You have to be careful when you use canned clams and clam juice,'' said Mr. Kalla. ''Sometimes the canned ones have salt, so you have to watch the salt. And if the recipe doesn't call for some kind of smoked product -- bacon, fatback -- it's not really chowder. That's essential in a chowder. The big rule is, don't skimp on ingredients. If it calls for cream, use cream.''</p>
        <p>And thank your stars you're not living in Melville's whaling days. At the Try Pots, Ishmael tells us, even the milk had a fishy odor. The mistress of the inn wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebrae, her hubby had his ledgers bound in shark skin, and their cow munched fish heads.</p>
        <p>Life is infinitely sweeter in modern-day New Jersey, where the old days of chowder extend only as far as 1931. That's when John and Louise Blum moved from Gloucester to Stone Harbor to start a lounge and seafood restaurant. Mr. Blum's signature dishes were clam chowder and snapper soup. Soup companies clamored, shall we say, for the recipes; the Blums resisted.</p>
        <p>Nearly 70 years later, their business, Henny's, is still using those recipes. Fans log on for the whole clammy story at hennys.com. Now true, the chowder didn't take any prizes at the Clam Chowder Cookoff last year, but it's still a favorite with customers, who buy it, says Mr. Brown, ''by the cup, bowl, and quart.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''It's always on the menu. I don't think we'll ever take it off.''</p>
        <p>This year, as last, Mr. Brown will whip up the chowder and leave it to his employer, Gary Blum -- great-grandson of the first Blums and the fourth generation of Blums to head up the family business -- to get it to the contest. Mr. Brown will not get the satisfaction of watching guest-judges sample his concoction. ''I'll be working,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That's a familiar story down at the shore. In the height of the season, there are bellies to fill. Larry Dion, 44, chef of the Rock 'n' Chair, a jazz cafe and restaurant in Avalon, entered the cookoff weeks ago but admits he has not had a chance to rethink the recipe he entered last year. ''I've just got to get to Labor Day,'' he huffed.</p>
