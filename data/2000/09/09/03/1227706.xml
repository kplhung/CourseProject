        <p>IT seems that you cannot turn on the television or open a newspaper these days without some sober-eyed chief executive offering a personal act of corporate contrition.</p>
        <p>In television advertisements, Jacques A. Nasser, chief of the Ford Motor Company, explains that he is doing his best to replace the Firestone tires said by regulators to have led to 88 deaths in the United States. Masatoshi Ono of Bridgestone/Firestone does the same in full-page newspaper ads. And James E. Goodwin, chairman of United Airlines, owned by UAL, bought commercial time to offer an apology for the company's recurrent flight delays.</p>
        <p>Media analysts said they expected to see these chief executives step in front of the camera. Such appearances are now part of a chief executive's job, the analysts say. And they predict that other leaders whose companies get into trouble will have to do likewise.</p>
        <p>Events of the last few years -- including President Clinton's taking to the airwaves with a personal mea culpa -- have primed audiences for this strategy, said Robert J. Thompson, founder of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University.</p>
        <p>''Madison Avenue has finally realized that deep in the American heart is this powerful respect for honesty,'' he said, ''and if you confess to something, you can get away with murder, sometimes literally.</p>
        <p>''It used to be you never wanted them to see you squirm. All of a sudden, corporate America has recognized the apology as the quickest way to make bad things go away.''</p>
        <p>Putting a leader's face on a crisis response is almost a necessity now, whether for potentially fatal product flaws or annoyances like flight delays, said Sue Parenio, an associate professor of advertising at Boston University. Americans are so fed up with poor treatment from large corporate bureaucracies, she said, that they will accept reassurance only from the top official.</p>
        <p>''When you call up and raise Cain about a product or service experience you had, the customer service reps say, 'yeah, yeah,' and it's not cutting it,'' Ms. Parenio said. ''Consumers have a lot more choices. If one company disappoints them, they are going to go somewhere else. They might live with you through a crisis, but only if they get to hear it from a top guy.''</p>
        <p>Or, as Robert J. Kopp, an associate professor who teaches marketing and advertising at Babson College, said, ''People, in their gut, like to be able to personalize a company.''</p>
        <p>But does it work even when the personality is a plain-vanilla one? Mr. Ono's advertisements, which began appearing in newspapers on Aug. 23, were an unadorned list of Firestone actions that left Mr. Kopp unimpressed.</p>
        <p>''When the advertisement says that Firestone initiated a 'voluntary safety recall,' anybody who's been following this will get a chuckle about that,'' Mr. Kopp said. ''It was voluntary, with a gun to your head.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ono, who speaks little English, did not appear in Firestone's television advertisements, which instead featured John Lampe, executive vice president for the company's United States unit.</p>
        <p>United Airlines had a more natural spokesman in Mr. Goodwin. On the heels of a print advertisement, United started running a TV commercial on Aug. 24. It shows Mr. Goodwin  walking through an empty airplane, presumably not one that passengers are waiting impatiently to board. It portrays him as a plain-talking, regular guy, the kind who could join a company as an accountant in 1967 and work his way up. It was shot in two hours. ''There was no wardrobe, no styling, no makeup,'' said Julie Thompson, a spokeswoman for Fallon Worldwide of Minneapolis, which designed the ad and has handled United's other ad campaigns.</p>
        <p>But the straightforward approach failed to persuade Susan Fournier, an associate professor at Harvard Business School who specializes in marketing and branding. She had been stuck in Chicago waiting for a United flight and had spent more than an hour in a line to get information. When she became aware of the ads, she was all the more critical. ''The left side of my brain is saying, 'Yeah, right,''' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fournier said United could take a lesson from James E. Burke, former chief of Johnson &amp; Johnson, who saved the reputation of Tylenol during the drug-tampering scare of 1982. Mr. Burke not only appeared on numerous TV interviews, but also gave public updates on all the company's actions, from removing products from shelves to introducing  tamper-resistant packaging. ''It had a lot of oomph behind it,'' she said. ''There is the acknowledgment, and then there is the reparation and recovery.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kopp agreed. ''I would recommend the C.E.O.'s view these campaigns with some continuity and come back to us with a follow-up'' with some concrete actions, he said. ''Otherwise, people will think they are just putting their finger in the dam before it bursts.''</p>
        <p>As yet, United has no particular plans to put Mr. Goodwin back on the screen. Ford is similarly unsure of Mr. Nasser's future appearances.  Carolyn Brown, a Ford spokeswoman, said that Mr. Nasser had received good reviews for his two television advertisements. Some 58 percent of focus group members said that after watching the first ad they had a positive view of Ford's handling of the recall; the percentage rose to 72 for the second commercial.</p>
        <p>Reaching directly to consumers through paid advertising was an obvious choice, said Matthew Triaca, a United spokesman. ''It was a great way to reach a large number of customers, direct and unfiltered,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not that these executives are always willingly their company's  spokesmen. Mr. Nasser initially declined to testify at this week's federal hearings on the tire recall, saying that others at Ford were better qualified to discuss specifics. Accused of being insufficiently open, he  reversed himself during a news conference on Thursday.</p>
        <p>But he and other chief executives usually leave the news conferences to others. Mr. Thompson, the television scholar, called it part of the strategy. ''The general makes the grand rhetorical statement, and you send the foot soldiers out to deal with the arrows slung by journalists,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, companies are ultimately accountable for the truth in their advertisements. Americans find it hard to reject a white flag, Mr. Thompson asserted, but they are more cynical than ever. And while it's easy enough to put a human face on a company, Mr. Thompson mused, people will ask, ''In the end, can a corporation really feel remorse?''</p>
