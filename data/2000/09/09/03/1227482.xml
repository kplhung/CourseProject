        <p>MARK LAMOS belongs to two worlds, in more ways than one. First, he seemed headed for a career as a classical violinist, a phase that lasted through four years at Northwestern University on a music scholarship. Then he discovered the theater, where his acting career lifted off in felicitous fashion, with an early Broadway appearance as the heartthrob Christian de Neuvillette opposite the Cyrano de Bergerac of Christopher Plummer and a subsequent Hamlet at the Old Globe in San Diego. Next, Mr. Lamos settled down as a director, first of straight plays, then also of opera. At 54, he works steadily in both genres. The combination, while not unique, is scarcely common. The track record, be it said, is exceptional.</p>
        <p>Right now, his mind is on Donizetti's ''Roberto Devereux,'' which opens the New York City Opera season at the New York State Theater on Sept. 12. Lauren Flanigan, his colleague on several previous occasions, plays the starring role of Queen Elizabeth, once played to iconic perfection on this stage by Beverly Sills. Thanks to popular revivals (''Madama Butterfly,'' ''Tosca,''  ''The Turn of the Screw'') and a transfer from Glimmerglass Opera (''Acis and Galatea''), the season shapes up as an informal Mark Lamos retrospective, with the director's signature on more than one in three of the company's 14 productions.</p>
        <p>And what is that signature? Paul Kellogg, long the artistic director at Glimmerglass and now also at City Opera, who has been presenting Mr. Lamos's work since 1990, puts it this way: ''On the whole, and certainly when Mark works for us, there's a unifying clarity and freshness that I consider his hallmark.''</p>
        <p>A vague answer, perhaps inevitably so. Unlike several brand-name colleagues, Mr. Lamos has never settled down with a single designer or circle of designers whose look might give his productions an obvious stamp. Nor is he a slave to directorial theory. Sometimes he mounts productions in period; sometimes he transposes. Above all, he is a poet of the theater, if by poetry you mean not embellishment and airy nothings but, as Mr. Lamos does, a property of thought. His word for this is ''concentration,'' the arrangement of all the elements of a production to point to one core truth.</p>
        <p>His dark, thick crop of hair brushed out of his face, dressed in ivory ducks, a navy button-down shirt and the wire-rim glasses of the inveterate bookworm, the director is unwinding at Calle Ocho, a humming Pan-Latin eatery, just steps from the new Rose Center for Earth and Space on the Upper West Side.</p>
        <p>Might I look in on a rehearsal? Sorry, no visitors.</p>
        <p>Could we look at some drawings?</p>
        <p>I happen to know that the City Opera press department has stuffed Mr. Lamos's backpack with color copies of what I hear are eye-catching set designs by Andrew Lieberman and sumptuous, period-inspired costumes by Judy Levin. They are not forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Please, could we talk about the show?</p>
        <p>''I'd rather not,'' Mr. Lamos replies, smiling at his martini, not ungraciously. ''I work off instinct.''</p>
        <p>Conversation through dinner is by no means the ordeal this opening may suggest. On any number of topics, Mr. Lamos swats the ball back and forth with nimble, unguarded ease. His recent relocation from Hartford to the Connecticut countryside, gardening, backstage politics, his latest musical discoveries, his fondness for intimate dinners, his horror of cocktail parties: all these yield delightful volleys.</p>
        <p>Productions in progress are another story. ''We work in a dream state,'' Mr. Lamos once told a roomful of directing interns, as good an explanation as any of his reticence. On the subject of ''Devereux,'' he eventually relents a little: ''I'm feeling very good about the production,'' he says. ''But I keep wondering. What is it we're saying here? We're still conceiving to a certain extent.''</p>
        <p>The idea of the auteur -- a director whose vision is the driving creative force of a collaborative work -- belongs to film criticism, but the phenomenon, if not the label, exists in the theater, too. Robert Wilson definitely qualifies; Peter Sellars probably does; Jonathan Miller may. Mr. Lamos definitely does not. One director he does recall is Giorgio Strehler: similarly light in touch, catholic in his tastes and inventive in making stage pictures that speak, equally at home in straight plays and opera.</p>
        <p>''I'm an interpreter,'' Mr. Lamos says. ''There's a school of thought that says it's not good directing unless the director's hand is unseen. That's not my view. I think that I'm present in a production, but that the material remains in the realm the creator intended. My attitude probably comes from being a musician. You learn how to play a Bach partita or a Mendelssohn sonata or the Copland Sonata, and you find a different voice for each but a voice that is your own, because that's who you are.</p>
        <p>''It's the same with acting. You use a different energy with Shakespeare than you do with Shaw or with a new piece. You're always releasing yourself into the piece and making it your own. You're finding a voice somehow: a voice that is yours but works with the piece.''</p>
        <p>Directing simply extends the process. Ideally, what results is a collaboration in which the sense of ownership extends to everyone on the team. At the design stage, Mr. Lamos may set the compass for a certain direction, but once the cast is assembled, the voyage unfolds according to its own dynamic. ''Everything in rehearsal is negotiation,'' Mr. Lamos says. ''If you have a tenor who is a stick and you want a tenor who moves like a dancer, you're just going to be unhappy. You have to find a way to make the show work with the cast you have.''</p>
        <p>Free-associate through memories of Lamos productions past, and what comes to mind? Pictures, mainly:</p>
        <p>* A cross-legged Oberon, king of the fairies in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (the play), hanging upside down over a quadrille of wrangling lovers as they splash through a pond.</p>
        <p>* ''Hedda Gabler'' played on a blood-red floor against bone-white walls, ''a state of mind with furniture,'' as Mr. Lamos once called it.</p>
        <p>* Helena, in ''All's Well That Ends Well,'' waltzing the moribund king of France from his four-poster deathbed with corkscrew columns.</p>
        <p>* Richard Thomas as Hamlet in some mad banana republic, with the court grandstanding to ubiquitous hand-held news cameras, long before such technology had degenerated into cliche.</p>
        <p>* Massenet's Werther expiring in a frozen tornado of his own love letters.</p>
        <p>* Jerry Hadley's Gatsby, in the premiere of John Harbison's opera, materializing from nowhere at the top of a staircase, for one brief, shining moment the dreamboat and the enigma Fitzgerald meant the character to be.</p>
        <p>* Wozzeck's shadow splayed like a crucifix against a wall.</p>
        <p>And toys. Toys in abundance. Rocking horses (''Peer Gynt,''  ''All's Well That Ends Well''). Doll's houses, some big enough for actors to take up residence in (''Tiny Alice,''  ''School for Wives''). Why?</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure,'' Mr. Lamos answers. ''I enjoy the scale of toys onstage, even giant ones, against the live performers. In 'Antony and Cleopatra,' the battle of Actium was staged with war toys: tiny ships on a map of the sea that burst into flames. Then A. and C. collapsed with shame and regret in the midst of the wreckage. I sense a nostalgia inherent in toys. For children, they represent an artificial adulthood. For adults, an irrecoverable past. They are iconic, completely representational. Like theater itself.''</p>
        <p>A STRING of epiphanies, ephemeral as epiphanies are bound to be. Yet two of Mr. Lamos's productions shine in memory with a brightness time has not touched.</p>
        <p>One is ''Il Re Pastore'' (''The Shepherd King''), at Glimmerglass. Minor Mozart, this early piece was written to instruct a young archduke in the virtue of magnanimity. Around the buckram of moral preachment, Mr. Lamos fashioned a silken ''entertainment for royal children,'' set in a schoolroom furnished with blackboard, alphabet blocks and a cradle. Onstage, pint-size extras appeared in gold paper crowns, spellbound as the cardboard characters of the plot came to life: mellifluous role models, enacted by the court tutors, starry storybook princes twinkling with benevolence that ennobled (and momentarily rejuvenated) even jaded oldsters out front in the house.</p>
        <p>Then there was ''The Rivals'' at the Hartford Stage, a production fit to have crowned any drama festival on the planet. Sheridan's featherweight plot involves two pairs of young lovers, each pair perfectly matched but for the dizzy romantic caprices of one of the ladies and the pathological jealousy of one of the beaus. The characters and their meddlesome elders are easy prey for slapstick, especially in the carnivals of artifice to which British comedy of the 18th century is usually reduced.</p>
        <p>But looking beyond the frippery, powdered wigs and innuendo, Mr. Lamos discovered in Sheridan's sentimental entanglements a clear-eyed yet mellow (sometimes melancholy) affection for human foibles we may well call Mozartean. Mrs. Malaprop herself, fount and origin of torrents of pompous poppycock, showed within her Amazonian affectations the disarming vulnerability of a fading belle. For an equally tactful and generous vision of the human comedy, one would have to go back to Ingmar Bergman's thoroughly atypical ''Smiles of a Summer Night'' or to Goldoni's ''Arlecchino, Servant of Two Masters'' in Strehler's well-traveled, much-revived production. (Someday, Mr. Lamos must direct Verdi's ''Falstaff.'')</p>
        <p>As chance or mystic correspondence would have it, Sheridan's comedy and Mozart's little pastorale date to 1775, the same charmed year. But that these most inspired of Mr. Lamos's productions both arise from the literature of the Enlightenment is no coincidence at all. On the cumulative evidence of his work, the 18th-century ideals of classical balance and harmony are his as well. (They were Strehler's, too, as evidenced in his Mozart and Goldoni, whose Arlecchino first stepped out in 1745.)</p>
        <p>''Balance is where I naturally go,'' Mr. Lamos says. ''Sometimes to the detriment of the play if the play isn't doing that.'' The caveat is perhaps unjust. More than a radical perspective, an enlightened mind-set opens doors to worlds governed by laws other than one's own. Here, too, may lie the key to Mr. Lamos's ease in bridging the chasm between plays and operas. Attuned as he is to their surface differences (and to the different working methods those differences impose), he perceives a musicality in action and a structure in melody, which form their common ground.</p>
        <p>MR. LAMOS has downed his decaf espresso. The night being balmy, we head home on foot up Columbus Avenue to apartments a block apart. Under the street lamp by his door, he surrenders the ''Devereux'' designs.</p>
        <p>What have we here? A marquee framed in light bulbs. Hard edges, strong verticals, stark diagonals. A color scheme dominated by red and black. Looming cutouts of Elizabeth in repeating formation, very sacramental. Framed glamour shots of divas of yesteryear. A checkerboard floor emblazoned, square by square with a portrait of the Virgin Queen.</p>
        <p>''It's about images of kingship,'' Mr. Lamos explains. Hmm.</p>
        <p>''We're not using this,'' he warns, pointing out one striking detail. ''And this area is different now.''</p>
        <p>Am I surprised? Experience has taught me that images in progress can look stranger than what audiences see, usually more cluttered, mostly less wondrous but sometimes more so. At a late rehearsal of Mr. Lamos's original staging of ''The Turn of the Screw,'' the character of the housekeeper came hulking onstage in a greatcoat lumpily studded with dolls. Toys lost in action. Also on the casualty list: a tyke in an angel suit, who walked Luciano Pavarotti onstage at the final dress for the dream vision of Verdi's ''Lombardi,'' the occasion of Mr. Lamos's Metropolitan Opera debut, in 1993.</p>
        <p>''I think it was a mistake to lose him,'' I suggest.</p>
        <p>''So do I,'' says Mr. Lamos.</p>
        <p>''Did the Met want you to get rid of him? Did Luciano?''</p>
        <p>''No. It was my decision.''</p>
        <p>How often, I wonder, is Mr. Lamos happy with a production?</p>
        <p>''Happy?'' he replies. ''I'm never happy. Or very rarely. The fun in the work comes when I see an idea transformed by the performers and the sets and the costumes and the lights into something far beyond what I ever imagined it could be.''</p>
        <p>Editing dreams is delicate work.</p>
        <p>Postscript, via e-mail, under the ironic, mock-Teutonic subject line ''DEVEREUX Konzept'':</p>
        <p>''I didn't mean to be coy,'' Mr. Lamos writes from cyberspace. ''I was intrigued by the cult of Elizabeth, the Tudor myth that her reign continually worked to uphold: the Virgin Queen, Gloriana. What we have in the design is a world of iconography. This is Elizabeth's world, not only as she created it for herself but as interpreters (Donizetti, Bette Davis, etc.) recreated it. And ultimately she is trapped in advertisements for herself, the advertisements that kept her myths alive and kept her ruling for as long as she did.</p>
        <p>''The intersection of queens and divas: that's here, too. Hence the high-contrast photos of famous divas hanging in front of the repeated portraits of the young Virgin Queen that jut out from the wings as if spying on the other characters. We're not so much concerned with making the opera look like history (as the production by Tito Capobianco with Beverly Sills attempted to do). We want to watch the major character being trapped in her own world of self-deception.</p>
        <p>''You can see why I don't, as you point out, theorize. As Peter Brook said, as soon as a theory in the performing arts makes itself evident, another production comes along and that requires a whole different set of theories.</p>
        <p>''Or something like that!''</p>
