        <p>THE Italians have reclaimed the Tudor-style restaurant overlooking Georgica Pond in Wainscott. For most of the last decade it housed Sapori di Mare; then last summer, Maya's provided a brief Caribbean interlude.  Now, it's called Saracen, a restaurant that celebrates the food of Southern Italy and Sicily, those Mediterranean crossroads where so many groups, including the Saracens, left their mark.</p>
        <p>Saracen achieved instant popularity after opening late in the summer season (after the Fourth of July).  Now that Labor Day is here, the crowds will thin, and the restaurant may be a more agreeable spot. In August, though, the ambience and service were found wanting.</p>

        <p>THE Italians have reclaimed the Tudor-style restaurant overlooking Georgica Pond in Wainscott. For most of the last decade it housed Sapori di Mare; then last summer, Maya's provided a brief Caribbean interlude.  Now, it's called Saracen, a restaurant that celebrates the food of Southern Italy and Sicily, those Mediterranean crossroads where so many groups, including the Saracens, left their mark.</p>
        <p>Saracen achieved instant popularity after opening late in the summer season (after the Fourth of July).  Now that Labor Day is here, the crowds will thin, and the restaurant may be a more agreeable spot. In August, though, the ambience and service were found wanting.</p>
        <p>The staff is what was once the norm for the Hamptons: attractive but clueless young people. That stereotype no longer holds at the best East End restaurants, but Saracen is a throwback. Hostesses are lovely-looking but vacant and cool. Our waiter one evening was downright rude, correcting diners' Italian pronunciations. A second waiter did the same thing another night. He had to be asked more than once for a Diet Coke and for additional wine glasses.  Runners delivering dishes didn't know who ordered what. In short, warmth and graciousness are absent here.</p>
        <p>But the kitchen was speedy, and the first impressions it makes are good: the bread was crusty and the chunky caponata, which arrived unbidden as soon as we sat down, was soul-satisfying.</p>
        <p>The decor is typical of the Hamptons: terra-cotta floors, a few potted palms and crisp white walls dotted with artistic photographs of seashells. For diners who want to escape the over-air-conditioned environment of most restaurants, there are a couple of porches, one screened, the other with open windows and ceiling fans.</p>
        <p>Among the starters, the airy mound of arugula supported by four grilled figs stuffed with Gorgonzola and prosciutto was especially appealing. Also topnotch were the warm rock shrimp, a dozen or more, served with sauteed rings of red onion and crisp spinach. The seafood salad included unorthodox ingredients like broccoli, but it was notably fresh and flavorful.</p>
        <p>A grilled vegetable napoleon layered with melted goat cheese also found favor, but zucchini flowers stuffed with mozzarella were overwhelmed by too much cheese.</p>
        <p>The best pasta is the penne alla Norma, a Sicilian favorite with roasted eggplant and grated ricotta salata. A wild mushroom risotto was not creamy enough, and gnocchi were average, neither rubbery nor feathery.</p>
        <p>Of the entrees, the fish surpass the meats. Chilean sea bass topped with chopped tomatoes and leeks was perfectly cooked. So, too, was the stripped bass in a Champagne sauce laden with vegetables. Braised monkfish, calamari, clams and shrimp were spiked with sherry vinegar and lemon.</p>
        <p>The best of the meats was the crunchy breaded veal chop under a salad of chopped tomatoes and arugula. The grilled veal chop crowned with roasted peppers, mushrooms and shrimp also passed muster. But filet mignon and rack of lamb were slightly overcooked and ordinary.</p>
        <p>Desserts disappointed, especially the tiramisu that was short on mascarpone. The apple tart arrived without its advertised apple fries, and the trio of sorbets (inexplicably, with only two flavors) arrived a cappella, not accompanied by the promised Champagne soup. Best bets are the creamy cheesecake and the rich chocolate mousse cake.</p>
        <p>Saracen  108 Montauk Highway, Wainscott, (631) 537-6255.</p>
