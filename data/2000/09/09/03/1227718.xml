        <p>In 1858, when Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were designing Central Park, the southeast entrance presented an uphill challenge, literally.</p>
        <p>The area, at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, was marked by low-lying swamplands capped by steep slopes and rocky outcrops. Not the kind of entrance befitting a major public park, they reasoned.</p>
        <p>So the swamp was turned into what Olmsted and Vaux called ''an ornamental sheet of water,'' a jagged-shaped pond, softened by aquatic and edge plantings.</p>
        <p>Over the years, the Pond has lost much of its early allure. The naturalistic shoreline is now a concrete-reinforced edge, and paved walkways have been added. Sediment and debris from nearby gutters have polluted the ecosystem. And unchecked weeds have choked oxygen-producing plants.</p>
        <p>But a $4 million project to restore the pond is now under way. The shoreline will be rebuilt, excess sediment removed, drain pipes diverted and Olmsted's landscape reborn. The project is being financed by a private donation through the Central Park Conservancy, the park's nonprofit custodians.</p>
        <p>''This honors the original design of 1858,'' Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said. ''It will be a great pond worthy of its location once again.''</p>
        <p>Before restoration can proceed, though, the thousands of creatures that call the 3.25-acre Pond home must be moved.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, parks officials scooped up 9,464 fish, transported them to large aerated tanks and drove them to several other bodies of water, including the Conservatory Water, another pond in the park near East 74th Street, where they will swim among model boats.</p>
        <p>The fish, which include tropical varieties abandoned by defeated pet owners, as well as sunfish, large-mouth bass and carp, will remain in those bodies of water until the scheduled completion of the project in spring 2001.</p>
        <p>Park officials in waders also rescued about 60 turtles, including a 25-pound snapper that had buried itself in the basin mud. They were transferred to the park lake near 74th Street.</p>
        <p>Rescue efforts, however, hit a snag over a ragged crew of five ducks that live on a promontory inside the pond. Three ducks, including two Peking ducks and a Canada goose, have been captured, but an injured Muscovy duck and a mallard remain at large.</p>
        <p>Ruth Machin, a nearby resident who considers the ducks her ''adopted children,'' had offered, along with some neighbors, to transfer the flock to a sanctuary upstate, but the plan was rejected.</p>
        <p>''For all we know, they are taking the ducks to a restaurant,'' Mr. Stern said.</p>
        <p>Instead, the ducks will be transferred to a rehabilitation center in Staten Island and resettled at a wildlife refuge in Queens.</p>

        <p>NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CENTRAL PARK  Correction:  September 10, 2000, Sunday  A picture caption in the Neighborhood Report pages last Sunday about the restoration of the Pond in Central Park misstated the position of Vi Ong, the worker shown. He is a gardener with the Central Park Conservancy, not a park ranger.</p>
