        <p>IRON SHOES</p>
        <p>By Molly Giles.</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster, $22.</p>
        <p>What makes dysfunctional families worth writing about isn't that they don't work, but that certain of their members cling so desperately to this thing that isn't working. Why doesn't everyone jump ship?, you wonder, and in the case of Molly Giles's funny, well-constructed first novel, ''Iron Shoes,'' you wonder this most about Kay Sorensen, the protagonist. Kay, a 40-year-old failed concert pianist and resident ''library lady,'' is part disheveled klutz and part borscht belt quipster. Kay's mother, Ida -- to the world a beauty, wit and charmer, to her two children a Joan Crawford-like shrew -- is dying after a second leg amputation. Though on morphine, Ida refuses to stop boozing, smoking and maliciously attacking Kay, who'd do just about anything for her mother short of getting her act together. Ida's primary concern is gaining the attention of her equally abrasive husband, Francis, a renowned architect who has spent a lifetime caring for his sporadically bedridden wife and being disgusted at his children -- initially for being children and then later for not having the guts to break away for good. Like her parents, Kay is a smoker and drinker, and the novel is shaped by her wrangling with her addictions as she attempts to resolve her feelings about her parents, to become a better wife and mother and to inject some passion into her life. Giles, the author of two previous short-story collections, is a gifted writer -- she's witty, with keen comic timing and a graceful sense of economy. A much-anticipated cigarette is likened to ''stable hay, sharp as summer sex with a stranger''; a sip of a much-anticipated martini comes as ''a sharp oily hit like an eel bite.'' The novel's weakness, though, is Kay herself, who doesn't elicit the pathos of, say, a wisecracking Lorrie Moore heroine: she's too given to self-castigation and self-analysis. Though he lacks emotional insight, Francis is more provocative. The product of a difficult family that he refuses to talk about, Francis has a tidy explanation for why families are ''not such a good idea'': ''You might, if you weren't careful, end up not changing.''</p>
