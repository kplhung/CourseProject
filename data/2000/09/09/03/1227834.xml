        <p>George Steinbrenner did not even go to Yankee Stadium yesterday for Old-Timers' Day, but his words still hovered over the Yankees in a weird yet hardly shocking manner. Steinbrenner squawks when things bother him, which was what he did Friday and yesterday, and which was why the Boss became the focus over baseball, past and present.</p>
        <p>In yesterday's Daily News, Steinbrenner expressed doubt about Chuck Knoblauch's puzzling elbow injury by saying the Yankees' medical staff cannot discover what is awry. He said Jeff Nelson should ''give us what we want and zip the lip'' and he criticized Mike Stanton's poor pitching, but said that at least Stanton admitted when he was struggling.</p>
        <p>The comments caused players and Manager Joe Torre to respond to the charges and made two relief pitchers and a second baseman more sought after by reporters than Don Mattingly or Yogi Berra. Steinbrenner embellished his words during a telephone interview from Ocala, Fla., yesterday.</p>
        <p>''Old-Timers' Day is great, but, if we don't get in the playoffs, no one's going to care about Old-Timers' Day,'' Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, said. ''Anything I'm telling these guys, I'm telling them to try to help the team. It's coming from the owner, so they should listen.''</p>
        <p>A few hours before the Yankees beat the Minnesota Twins, 13-4, in a rain-shortened seven-inning game, an outraged Knoblauch defended himself against what he perceived as accusations that he was not hurt as seriously as he was claiming and he was not playing because of his throwing problems. Knoblauch used several expletives in discussing how ludicrous it would be for him not to want to play.</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of being questioned every day like I've got to prove myself,'' Knoblauch said. ''What do I got to hide from? Everybody in the world knows I got a throwing problem. So what am I afraid of? That means I'm not hurt?</p>
        <p>''If I didn't want to play, I'd be home. I've done every test, cortisone, whatever. What else am I supposed to do?''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner revealed that Knoblauch twice rebuffed the Yankees when they asked him to get a cortisone shot in his elbow, but he had a shot to treat his tendinitis last Tuesday. Knoblauch said ''write whatever you want'' as a reporter tried asking him about refusing to get a shot. Knoblauch, whose medical results were reviewed by team doctors in New York and Tampa, Fla., and by Dr. James Andrews of Birmingham, Ala., was surprised when the Yankees activated him on Friday.</p>
        <p>''He's baffled why he's in New York?'' Steinbrenner asked. ''I'm baffled. I like this kid, but I can't understand him. Do I know whether he's hurt? No. I can only go by what our doctors say. They mark him as able. Jeter is black-and-blue. O'Neill has a hip problem. Canseco is hobbling. Every player is hurt and they're fighting like warriors. I hope Knoblauch gets back with them.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch was in uniform and did not play for the second straight game as the Yankees pummeled Eric Milton and four other pitchers to win their third in a row and move to 20 games over .500. Derek Jeter, Jorge Posada and Paul O'Neill, the first three hitters in the lineup, were 7 for 11 with eight runs scored and five runs batted in. O'Neill, Posada and Scott Brosius homered, and Denny Neagle pitched five and a third innings to earn the victory.</p>
        <p>After he initially said he did not care if Steinbrenner was trying to infer that he did not have pain, Knoblauch wondered why he wasn't asked about it while he was rehabilitating in Tampa, Fla., last month.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner said: ''I never expressed anything to him because I never felt he wasn't hurt. I was confounded. I was confounded because he couldn't throw the ball to first base.''</p>
        <p>After Torre said Steinbrenner's comments bothered him only if they bothered Nelson and Stanton, he defended Knoblauch against the notion that he was afraid to play.</p>
        <p>''It's unfortunate,'' Torre said. ''I don't feel that way. If people do feel that way, I'm sorry that they do. It's unfair if someone is hurt. I'm trying to figure out why he would want to be hurt if he isn't hurt. It doesn't make any sense.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch was about 20 feet from Torre's office when he spoke, his voice rising, and he said everyone should view his elbow injury the way Torre had.</p>
        <p>''If I didn't have a throwing problem, no one would be questioning why I was hurt. No one,'' said Knoblauch, who has committed 15 errors. ''I've got 10 years in the big leagues without being hurt. I go on the D.L. once and I get questioned about being hurt?''</p>
        <p>But Steinbrenner continued to link Knoblauch's tendinitis and his throwing difficulties, saying: ''This thing came about because he wasn't able to throw to first base with confidence. When he couldn't hit the first baseman, all of a sudden comes this stuff.''</p>
        <p>Nelson learned about Steinbrenner's comments when a neighbor alerted him yesterday. Steinbrenner criticized Nelson for pitching wildly and for having a shouting match with Torre on Aug. 20, even though the bullpen has been a staple in helping the Yankees win three of the last four World Series titles. Nelson ominously said, ''I got 29 days and the playoffs to put up with this.''</p>
        <p>When Nelson was asked if he was planning to leave New York as a free agent after the season, he dodged the question. But Nelson was rebuffed when he asked Steinbrenner for a four-year, $16 million contract during spring training and one of his friends said the reliever wanted to sign with the Seattle Mariners.  ''Whatever George says doesn't affect me,'' said Nelson, who has blown four saves in four tries. ''I'm not going to go on the mound and start thinking about what George said. I don't pitch for him. I pitch for the team and myself.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner, who said the Yankees would not go far if Nelson and Stanton did not ''put up or shut up,'' added: ''Do I want Nelson back? I hope he comes back. If he wants to know about frustration, he should have half the frustrations I have.''</p>
        <p>Stanton has allowed homers in his last four games after giving up one in his first 55 games and said Steinbrenner would be accurate for saying he had not ''done the job.'' Stanton was asked about Steinbrenner's curious timing for his comments and said, ''I think it's more the timing of when I'm stinking.''</p>
        <p>Everyone laughed, something that did not happen around Knoblauch. When he had a sore left forearm in June, Knoblauch was perturbed by speculation that he did not want to play because of throwing problems. And now, on Old-Timers' Day, Steinbrenner made the present feel more like the past.</p>
        <p>''If this helps get Knoblauch out there on the field, let him vent on me,'' Steinbrenner said. ''I'm all for helping the team.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DON MATTINGLY, who returned to Yankee Stadium for his first Old-Timers' Day, said becoming a coach or a manager remained ''a possibility'' for him. . . . RAMIRO MENDOZA, who will throw a simulated game tomorrow to test his right shoulder, expects to be ready for the postseason.</p>
