        <p>It's not easy being a Jew in a Jewish neighborhood [''Is It a House or a Synagogue?'' Aug. 20]. Given the orthodox mentality, the same could probably be said about other major religions -- the Muslims and Christians -- in those places where the orthodox versions live juxtaposed with liberal co-religionists.</p>
        <p>The orthodox exude an inspired certainty about the will of God -- some even attest to supernatural visual and auditory communications. In the flux of these events they frequently manage to identify self-interest with the will of God. Since the will of God is the highest possible good, anything they do (however immoral or illegal) in order to achieve their goal is O.K. The end's justifying the means plays out again and again.</p>

        <p>The Times reports almost daily on orthodox-fundamentalist scenes -- in Iran, Israel, Indonesia and even on Long Island. The common denominator is their theocratic aspirations: they want to control government as a means of achieving their spiritual and earthly dominance. Many orthodox representatives appear sure of their spiritual compass and primacy. Some will not allow that there might be multiple means to achieve spiritual redemption. Can they all be right?</p>
