        <p>IN the world of golf club design, Richard Helmstetter has a clear objective: ''inventing new stuff.'' Mr. Helmstetter, senior executive vice president and chief of new products at the Callaway Golf Company in Carlsbad, Calif., is in charge of a research-and-development team that produced the ERC Forged Titanium Driver, a club so powerful that it violates equipment rules set by the United States Golf Association.</p>
        <p>About four years ago, Mr. Helmstetter's team found that a driver prototype made of forged titanium could send a golf ball 20 to 30 yards farther than comparable clubs, but ''we couldn't figure why it was so much faster, why it was so great,'' he said.</p>

        <p>IN the world of golf club design, Richard Helmstetter has a clear objective: ''inventing new stuff.'' Mr. Helmstetter, senior executive vice president and chief of new products at the Callaway Golf Company in Carlsbad, Calif., is in charge of a research-and-development team that produced the ERC Forged Titanium Driver, a club so powerful that it violates equipment rules set by the United States Golf Association.</p>
        <p>About four years ago, Mr. Helmstetter's team found that a driver prototype made of forged titanium could send a golf ball 20 to 30 yards farther than comparable clubs, but ''we couldn't figure why it was so much faster, why it was so great,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He assumed that the secret was in forging the titanium -- pounding the heated metal into shape -- rather than casting it in a mold. His team made copycat drivers from forged metal, but found that none were as effective as the first. So forged titanium wasn't the reason in itself.</p>
        <p>Using technology that measures armor on Navy warships, Mr. Helmstetter's team found the answer. Unknown to the team, the original prototype had varying thicknesses of the metal on its face, the area that strikes the ball. Rather than absorbing the shock, the team found, a club with varying thickness reflects the force back on the ball, giving it greater speed.</p>
        <p>After conducting tests, the United States Golf Association added the driver to its list of clubs, now at 21, that are banned from competitive play. Association technicians test a driver by shooting a golf ball at it and measuring the speed at which the ball approaches and leaves the face. If it leaves the face too quickly, said John Spitzer, assistant technical director at the association, the club is determined to have ''the impact of a spring'' and is kept out of competition.</p>
        <p>The driver can be used in tournament play in Europe and Asia, where the association's rules do not apply. Americans, of course, can still use the driver on their own; it is available in some stores for around $1,200.</p>
