        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''What's Black and White and Sells Medicine?'' (Aug. 27), which discussed the marketing of new drugs by Pfizer Inc.:</p>
        <p>To help Sesame Workshop pursue its educational goals for preschoolers, Pfizer has contributed significant financial resources, including partial underwriting for ''Sesame Street'' on PBS and sponsorship of a special issue of Sesame Street Parents magazine called '''How to Take Care of a Sick Child.'' This publication, however, is in no way unusual; it is part of a long list of Sesame Workshop's outreach activities that have covered lead poisoning prevention, asthma treatment, early literacy, child safety and other topics.</p>
        <p>The editorial integrity of our content has never been compromised by any underwriter, including Pfizer, and the content of our programs, based on research with children and child development experts, stands on its own merits. None of our content, including our characters or print materials, has ever promoted the antibiotic Zithromax or any other Pfizer brands. In fact, the special magazine issue warned against the overprescription of antibiotics.</p>
        <p>GARY E. KNELL  New York City, Aug. 28</p>
        <p>The writer is president and chief executive of Sesame Workshop.</p>
