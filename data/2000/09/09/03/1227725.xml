        <p>BILL COSBY has a jet named Camille, for his wife, and even Oprah got a jet,'' Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said recently over lunch at City Hall, a restaurant near his law office in Lower Manhattan. ''She wanted a plane just like Bill Cosby's. It's, like, amazing. He goes to sleep on the plane. It's wonderful.''</p>
        <p>Clearly dazzled by the luxury of personal transportation, Mr. Cochran has studied the subject. He is now getting a jet, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran, who broke into the top-level national law leagues when he successfully defended O. J. Simpson against charges that he murdered his former wife, is now hitting the major money leagues as well, and he has the status-symbol issue down pat.</p>
        <p>''We're not getting a GII,'' he conceded, his voice showing a tinge of disappointment that he is not buying a Gulfstream model favored by many chief executives. ''My plane won't be that big -- more like a Hawker or a Citation.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cochran, showing his newfound financial prudence, will not make the purchase rashly. His law firm, which is building a national practice, is still deciding whether to buy or lease the plane. ''We are going to see how often we would use it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Success is hardly new to Mr. Cochran, who is now 62. Long before his disciplined, relentless cross-examination and his flamboyant attire became a daily staple of the grueling O. J. Simpson murder trial, he was a prominent lawyer with a busy criminal and civil practice. His performance at the televised trial, however, made Mr. Cochran, a member of the ''dream team'' defense, a celebrity in his own right.</p>
        <p>But it did not leave him as rich as it left him famous. Now he is trying to close that gap, adopting a new money-management philosophy that includes putting more money into the stock market.</p>
        <p>His success ''allowed him to move up the lawyer food chain,'' said his accountant, John Baiardi, a partner at Mitchell &amp; Titus, the nation's largest minority-owned accounting firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran no longer takes criminal cases, but he has a thriving personal practice that includes intellectual property, personal-injury and business lawsuits. And last year, in a move that leverages his brand name, he merged his firm with Schneider, Kleinick, Weitz, Damashek &amp; Shoot, a personal-injury firm based in New York. Partners share the legal fees in cases they win together.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran says his net worth is more than $5 million -- in retirement plans, private investments, a sprinkling of stocks and his major holding, real estate. His properties include homes in Los Angeles, including  beach homes in Marina del Rey for himself and his parents, a new condominium in Manhattan where he now spends one-third of his time, and two apartment buildings in West Hollywood that he bought as an investment. That net worth figure does not include the value of his law firm.</p>
        <p>But he may be about to make a quantum leap.</p>
        <p>Within five years, his net worth could soar to $25 million or even $50 million, Mr. Baiardi said, as fees roll in from the exploding demand for his legal services.</p>
        <p>To which Mr. Cochran replied, ''I hope we will do that well.''</p>
        <p>Lester Brickman, a law firm compensation expert and a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardoza School of Law, agreed that the personal-injury fees could contribute to a bump-up in Mr. Cochran's net worth. Lawyers in that area are very selective about the cases they take on, have a high success rate and often reap big financial rewards. But maybe not as high as Mr. Baiardi suggested. ''It is in the realm of possibility that Cochran can net over $10 million a year,'' Mr. Brickman said.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Cochran was earning $1 million or so annually by the time the Simpson trial ended in 1995.</p>
        <p>''Before, I was interested in earning money,'' Mr. Cochran said. ''Now, I'm interested in what happens to it. I don't want to be haphazard -- I want a team I can count on.''</p>
        <p>WITH the help of people like Earl G. Graves Sr., the publisher of Black Enterprise magazine and leading black entrepreneur, whom he had met through some business dealings, he is tapping into the African-American financial establishment in New York. The goal is to help build that dream team and to create a network of relationships in the financial sphere, much as he once did in the legal establishment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran's new focus on finances started in early 1997, when he decided that he had been spending so much time in Manhattan for his program on Court TV that he ought to put down roots. So he bought a pied a terre on West 57th Street in Midtown for about $750,000.</p>
        <p>After settling in, he called Mr. Graves. ''He is one of my gurus,'' Mr. Cochran said. ''Earl is into wealth.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Graves said Mr. Cochran peppered him with questions. ''He said, 'Tell me what I need to know in town,' '' Mr. Graves recalled. First, he steered him to Carver Bancorp, the largest black-run bank in the country, where Mr. Cochran's personal-injury clients could borrow money. ''Then Johnnie told me, 'The way you look is the way I ought to look.' '' So I sent him to the John Atchison hair salon on West 56th Street. He told me it was too expensive, so I sent him a gift certificate.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Cochran's finances, ''I asked him, 'What are you going to do about your own money?' '' Mr. Graves added. ''And he asked me who I should invest with.'' Mr. Graves introduced him to Bert N. Mitchell of Mitchell &amp; Titus and other black financial leaders.</p>
        <p>''New York has been a real eye-opener for me,'' Mr. Cochran said. ''Most of the people in L.A. who have money are entertainers. And L.A. is more spread out -- here you talk, you find out what other guys are doing. In New York, everything is geared to business.''</p>
        <p>The team that Mr. Cochran has assembled is ethnically diverse. Guided by Mr. Baiardi, who is white, and Jeri Norris, a black financial consultant and a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Cochran is educating himself about more sophisticated investing strategies. ''We didn't grow up on Wall Street, but we should move there now,'' he said, remembering something that Jesse Jackson said while trying to encourage blacks to invest.</p>
        <p>''I should have gotten into the stock market earlier,'' Mr. Cochran said over the recent two-hour lunch of seafood and creamed spinach.</p>
        <p>Ms. Norris is seeing to that. Wanting to preserve Mr. Cochran's capital, she said, ''we want a mix of old-economy and technology stocks.'' Among her picks for his portfolio are Sun Microsystems, J. P. Morgan and the American International Group. Her long-term goal for him is 70 percent equities, 20 percent bonds and 10 percent cash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran said he preferred to leave the decisions to Ms. Norris: ''My wife and I don't want to wake up worrying about the market,'' he said. But he did make one choice: last year, he bought about $150,000 worth of Time Warner stock. He knew the company because it owned Court TV, where for two years he had a talk show on legal issues, but he does even know today what the value of that investment is -- except that the stock has gone up.</p>
        <p>Though he does not want the final responsibility of making investment decisions, Mr. Cochran wants to know the issues and speaks often to Ms. Norris. To cement the relationship, he and his wife recently took Ms. Norris and her husband to the theater and to dinner at Aquavit in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran is also listening to advice about his real estate and about the kinds of deals in which he invests. Gone are the days of jumping into deals heard about at cocktail parties. Mr. Cochran says future deals will be more carefully vetted by Mr. Baiardi, ''who is my sounding board.''</p>
        <p>IF Mr. Cochran cannot resist gambling in venture capital and private equity, Mr. Baiardi wants him to go only with blue-chip recommendations. ''It is one thing if your brother-in-law introduces you to someone who has a deal,'' Mr. Baiardi said. ''It is another thing when you go to an investment bank and they do some private equity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baiardi would also like Mr. Cochran to sell the two apartment buildings in West Hollywood. ''If you are in real estate, you have to collect your own rents,'' Mr. Baiardi said. ''It's one thing to own commercial property that Trump manages. It is another thing to own rental properties and collect rent.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baiardi is not having a problem convincing Mr. Cochran. Though real estate had represented his main investment for years, the risks became apparent in the late 1980's. ''You never thought about the stock market when I started buying real estate,'' he recalled. ''You just assumed real estate was stable and would keep going up. Then it went down, so that was unsettling.''</p>
        <p>A Merrill Lynch team suggested that Mr. Cochran borrow the entire purchase price of his new condominium against his existing real estate,  rather than raising cash to make a large down payment. The move let him deduct all the interest and reduce taxes. ''His first instinct was to pay off as much as possible,'' Ms. Norris recalled.</p>
        <p>Until now. ''My first thing is always to pay things off,'' Mr. Cochran said. But he said he had learned that ''you can get deductions and it does not always pay to pay it off.''</p>
        <p>''I really wanted to get good tax advice,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran is even toning down his lifestyle a bit -- to be less showy. No more Rolls-Royces, like the one he drives around Los Angeles. Today, he said, he likes ''stealth wealth -- Jeeps, all that stuff.''</p>
        <p>''I think now, where I am, I would not drive a Rolls in New York,'' he added. ''But as a young man, it was a sign of success. My clients wanted to see that. Driving a Toyota or a Mazda was terrible. If you didn't have a Rolls, you weren't very successful.''</p>
        <p>He has given up his Rolexes, too. ''After a period of time, that's not as important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran has also become more pragmatic about his personal life, which was once in disarray. The other night, he said, he and his wife of 15 years, Dale, a marketing executive who is now starting a new business, were watching an episode on HBO's ''Sex and the City'' that dealt with prenuptial agreements. ''I mentioned a prenup and we laughed about it,'' he said. ''But absolutely I would have one now. My estate has gone up, and I think in this world, that's the way to go.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran's current life is a far cry from a childhood that began in Shreveport, La., where his father was once a sharecropper. But the family was ambitious. By the time he was 6, his father and mother had packed up their four children and moved to California, where the elder Mr. Cochran eventually became a successful insurance salesman.</p>
        <p>The Cochrans were also determined that their children receive a good education. They sent Mr. Cochran to Los Angeles High School, which had a far better academic reputation than the school closer to his home.</p>
        <p>VISITING the homes of wealthy white friends whom he met at school was a revelation for Mr. Cochran, who grew up without television or other entree to that world. ''I had no way to know how they lived before that,'' he said. ''Remember, there was a big class thing. How would you know unless you worked for them?'' he added, speaking of his friends' families.</p>
        <p>And though Mr. Cochran made friends at the school whom he has kept until this day, he said he did not bring them to his house.</p>
        <p>His parents encouraged him to become a professional. His mother wanted him to be a doctor, but Mr. Cochran thought that law would suit him better, letting him use his skills of persuasion.</p>
        <p>In 1963, after graduating from Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, he became the first black law clerk in the Los Angeles city attorney's office, making $608 a month. His job involved prosecuting people, primarily black, who were charged with avoiding arrest. But that, he came to believe, was aimed at keeping them from filing civil suits against the city for compensation for their injuries.</p>
        <p>By 1965, he and Gerald Lenoir, a seasoned criminal lawyer, had started a practice together. Their first windfall came fast. When rioting exploded in Los Angeles's poor, mainly black, Watts district, Mr. Cochran was alone in the office. As the rioting escalated and the police began making arrests, clients came to the office until 11 or 12 at night, putting retainer fees on his desk -- in cash.</p>
        <p>''That was the first time I became aware: 'Geez, you can make a lot of money doing this,' '' Mr. Cochran said. ''People would come with $3,000 or $4,000. It was sad. You had a weird feeling. The city was going up in smoke. But it was the first time I knew the practice of law could be remunerative.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran learned quickly that criminal defense lawyers need the money up front. ''They used to say, 'Get the money while the tears are falling,' '' he recalled. Otherwise, he added, an acquitted client would say, ''I was innocent anyway,'' and a convicted one would ask, ''What did you do for me?''</p>
        <p>His practice expanded to civil cases, including police brutality suits. ''Later, I started getting the big fees from contingency cases,'' he said. ''You get one-third after you win, so you got to win.''</p>
        <p>In those years, Mr. Cochran worried a lot about the cash flow, often asking whether any checks had come in while he was in court.</p>
        <p>Still, he set parameters. When a known drug dealer showed up with a suitcase filled with $600,000 in cash, Mr. Cochran refused to represent him. ''It was the most money I had ever seen,'' he said. ''But I knew drugs were killing kids in the black community, and I didn't take the case. I knew where the money had come from.''</p>
        <p>Over time, as word spread about his successes, the money poured in. And Mr. Cochran was not shy about spending his earnings on his family and personal luxuries. ''I would buy clothes and nice cars,'' he said. At one point, he had six fancy cars. ''It wasn't always wise,'' he added.</p>
        <p>He spent money on a handful of deals, involving oil, a supper club, radio stations and other things, with mixed results.</p>
        <p>He also spent a lot of money on an extramarital relationship, according to ''Life After Johnnie Cochran,'' a 1995 book by his former wife, Barbara Cochran Berry. In 1965, he started a relationship with Patricia Sikora, who would become the mother of his only son, Ms. Berry wrote. In 1973, according to Ms. Berry, he took out a loan to help pay for a house he was buying for Ms. Sikora, and he tried to get Ms. Berry to sign an agreement that she had no rights to the house, an accusation that Mr. Cochran has denied. In the view of Ms. Berry, with whom he has two daughters, he used his money as a form of manipulation.</p>
        <p>''Money and the gifts it bought were the sum and substance of what a woman had a right to expect from a man,'' she wrote, interpreting what he conveyed to her. ''This need of women for money and security were tools to be used in their control, to keep them in their place.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran said: ''This is ridiculous. My poor dear ex-wife -- it is not true. She saw a chance to write a book and to try to make some money.''</p>
        <p>Even after the Cochrans divorced in 1977 and Mr. Cochran married his current wife in 1985, he continued to send Ms. Sikora $4,000 a month, according to a palimony suit that Ms. Sikora filed in 1995 after, she said, Mr. Cochran cut her off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran said he sent the money because ''I was supporting my son.'' Now 27, the son, Jonathan Cochran, is on his own, working for the California Highway Patrol.</p>
        <p>The suit was dismissed and is on appeal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran's financial contributions extended to other family members as well. For years, he helped his parents and a brother; his widowed father now lives with him in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>He even sent his first wife a television set as a wedding present when she remarried. He has also given money away, most recently creating the Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Art Fund, financed with several hundred thousand dollars to help minority artists.</p>
        <p>Though he spent his money liberally, his investment strategy was conservative. (He agrees with a friend who once told him that his ties were more flamboyant than his investing style.) He stuck with real estate and he avoided the stock market -- a strategy that several experts say is common among blacks.</p>
        <p>''The stock market is still the easiest way to get into the wealth game,'' said Brooke Stephens, author of ''Talking Dollars and Making Sense: A Wealth-Building Guide for African-Americans.'' ''But many blacks don't trust it and don't understand it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cochran said his conservatism was in part a result of memories from childhood that left him worried about taxes. ''You would hear stories about Joe Louis and Sammy Davis Jr.'' he recalled. ''They took Sammy's house away from him. And I would think: I am never going to be like that. I want to pay my taxes.''</p>
        <p>''You grow up with certain fears,'' he added. ''You want to be secure. If you have been poor, you understand that if you worked real hard, you don't want to go back and be there anymore. Tax problems have always been a big problem for people who became successful in our community. I vowed that would never be a problem.''</p>
        <p>He sees himself as still somewhat of a target. ''I get audited every year,'' he said. ''I am getting audited right now. They read about my book deal,'' he said, referring to his advance for ''Journey to Justice'' of about $3 million. He added that they say, '' 'Where is the money,' as though you are not going to pay taxes.''</p>
        <p>But over the next decade, Mr. Cochran's biggest problem will not be taxes, but how to invest all the wealth he is accruing after he pays his taxes. And he seems to be well on his way to solving that problem.</p>
