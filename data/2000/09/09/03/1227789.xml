        <p>China is demanding that American officials dismiss a federal civil lawsuit charging a high-ranking official with human rights abuses stemming from the 1989 military crackdown that killed hundreds of student protesters in Tiananmen Square.</p>

        <p>China is demanding that American officials dismiss a federal civil lawsuit charging a high-ranking official with human rights abuses stemming from the 1989 military crackdown that killed hundreds of student protesters in Tiananmen Square.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit was filed Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan by five participants in the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. The suit was brought against Li Peng, the country's prime minister at the time and now the chairman of the National People's Congress.</p>
        <p>Chinese officials blamed the United States government for not properly protecting Mr. Li from having a court summons served to him while he was in New York for a United Nations conference of members of parliaments. A process server handed the summons to a State Department employee guarding Mr. Li. Although the department later said it could not accept such papers, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled that Mr. Li could be served through his guards.</p>
        <p>''What happened in New York concerning the serving of the court papers is a political farce, put together by a small number of anti-China elements,'' Zhang Yuanyuan, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a telephone interview on Friday night.</p>
        <p>The civil suit was filed by lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit legal group that specializes in human rights cases. It is the first time that such a legal action has been taken against a Chinese official.</p>
        <p>The Chinese government is ''expressing strong opposition, strong displeasure and dissatisfaction with the incident, and launching a strong protest,'' Mr. Zhang said. He added that the charges were ''absolutely absurd and unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>State Department officials could not be reached yesterday for comment.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit accuses Mr. Li of being responsible for ''crimes against humanity,'' including summary execution, arbitrary detention and torture.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs, who live in the United States, are four former student dissidents and one man, Zhang Liming, whose sister was shot dead by army troops that overran Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Among the former students is Wang Dan, who was released from a Chinese prison in 1998 and exiled to the United States.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for the lawsuit comes from two American statutes that allow human rights victims anywhere in the world to file for claims in this country's courts. Mr. Li has more than two weeks to answer the court order. He flew back to China on Friday.</p>
