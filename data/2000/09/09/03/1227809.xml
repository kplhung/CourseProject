        <p>So much sewage floated in the Hudson River in the 1950's that Shabazz Jackson and his friends made up their own version of the breast stroke when they swam along the shore in Beacon, N.Y.

        <p>So much sewage floated in the Hudson River in the 1950's that Shabazz Jackson and his friends made up their own version of the breast stroke when they swam along the shore in Beacon, N.Y. They would jump in feet first, then flail their arms to push the stinking mess away from their faces.</p>
        <p>''We all swam in the Hudson,'' said Mr. Jackson, 50, an environmental engineer who still lives in Beacon. ''It was an open sewer, but it was still the mighty river. You'd just swim with your head out of the water and push the debris away with your arms.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Jackson still jumps into the river, but he is more likely to bump into other swimmers than into raw sewage.</p>
        <p>After nearly 30 years of cleanup efforts, the Hudson River has rebounded from a dumping ground for human and industrial waste to one of the state's leading recreational sites. Now there is even officially sanctioned swimming in its waters, from organized races around Manhattan to a handful of public beaches in Westchester and Ulster Counties.</p>
        <p>This Labor Day weekend, with the unofficial end of summer, hundreds of swimmers stroked their way into the Hudson River for the first time. And if New York State officials have their way, even more will have the opportunity to do so over the next few years. The Department of Environmental Conservation and the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation want to create a string of state-operated beaches along the Hudson's shores from the northern tip of Manhattan to Columbia County, just south of Albany.</p>
        <p>''I think it's clean and safe for swimming,'' said Deborah Knaust, 35, a Saugerties resident who took her two young daughters to the beach at Ulster Landing Park on a recent sweltering afternoon. ''We're normal people. We don't have seven toes, we don't have a third eye, and we've been swimming in the Hudson our whole lives.''</p>
        <p>Like Mrs. Knaust, other parents watched unalarmed while their dripping-wet children wiped river water from their eyes and mouths. Several boys splashed their arms in the brownish water, no more than two or three feet deep in places, and pelted one another with sea grass. They yelled in excitement when a power boat barreling down the middle of the Hudson pushed the waves higher.</p>
        <p>''That was so cool; it's like being in the ocean without the jellyfish,'' said Jack Jervis, 13, a Kingston resident who was at the beach with his aunt and two cousins. ''Hey wait for me,'' he yelled before joining them again in the river.</p>
        <p>Still, the Hudson is not for everyone. Daniel L. Thomason, 28, a financial consultant from Manhattan who was visiting friends, steadfastly refused to leave his beach chair. ''I would need a lot more convincing, let's put it that way,'' said Mr. Thomason, ignoring the beckoning wave of a friend. ''The Hudson may be cleaner now, but it smells and looks nasty. I wouldn't even let my dog swim in there.''</p>
        <p>While the very notion can still wrinkle noses, people have been dipping into the Hudson as long as anyone can remember. Open-bottom barges anchored in the Hudson and East Rivers, known as ''floating swimming pools,'' were used by city dwellers for bathing at the turn of the century. And swimming areas once dotted the riverbanks, including Cole's Grove, a dock and pavilions at the Catskills home of Thomas Cole, the founder of the Hudson River School of painters.</p>
        <p>There were health risks in earlier years, of course, from exposure to the raw sewage, garbage and chemicals routinely dumped into the river by industries along its shores. But the 1972 Clean Water Act, which required that sewage be treated before being released in the river, as well as  later pollution controls, cleaned up the river and made much of it fit for swimming (though the waters surrounding New York City are still below that standard).</p>
        <p>Even those who shunned the Hudson in the bad days have plunged right in. Gov. George E. Pataki dives into the river a half-dozen times a year from a sailboat that he keeps in Verplanck. ''When I was a kid, you wouldn't even stick your toe in the Hudson River,'' Mr. Pataki said in a phone interview. ''It was so polluted your parents and everybody made it plain that you risked life and limb by setting foot in there.''</p>
        <p>Local families have been swimming at Croton Point Park, Westchester's only public beach on the Hudson, since it reopened in 1996. Maria Tamaoka, 44, who owns a quilt store in Croton-on-Hudson, said swimming in the river was much cheaper than joining the outdoor pool at her family's athletic club. Her daughter Anna, 12, had her last two birthday parties at the beach.</p>
        <p>''We just love it here,'' said Mrs. Tamaoka, gazing at the white sails of boats in the river. ''Just hearing the waves is relaxing. And we're only two minutes away. Why drive an hour and a half somewhere else?''</p>
        <p>Then she added a caveat. ''But I don't think you should write all these advantages; we don't want everyone coming to our beach.''</p>
        <p>The rectangular swimming area, cordoned off by blue-and-white buoys, is only about five feet at its deepest. And while the water looked more clear than cloudy, it had a greenish tint, and swimmers could barely see the sandy bottom. Goose feathers, cigarette butts and a plastic soda bottle floated on the surface.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of dirty but it's better than the beach where I live,'' said Steven Valentin, 20, a college student from the Bronx who was swimming in the river for the first time. ''I would do it again, but it does need to be cleaner.''</p>
        <p>Would he become a regular here? ''To tell you the truth, I'd rather go in the pool,'' he said.</p>
