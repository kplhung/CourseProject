        <p>Over the last three decades, State Senator Roy M. Goodman has become a fixture in the politics of Manhattan's East Side and a leader of the moderate wing of the state's Republican Party.</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Goodman, 70, runs for a 17th term this year, the Democratic Party is hoping to put to an end the Goodman era in Albany. And the race to determine Mr. Goodman's Democratic challenger has developed into one of the most hotly contested State Senate primaries of the year.</p>
        <p>The race, in the 26th Senate District, has attracted much attention in New York City and beyond because Mr. Goodman is considered to be among a group of vulnerable Republican incumbents. In the 1998 election, Mr. Goodman had the weakest showing of any incumbent senator, and his margins of victory have eroded in each of the last two elections. With a growing number of registered Democrats in the district, party officials say that this year offers the best prospect to defeat Mr. Goodman. He has overcome Democratic majorities before, but the ratio has grown to more than 2 to 1, with 52 percent registered as Democrats and 23 percent as Republicans.</p>
        <p>The two Democrats running in the Sept. 12 primary have distinctly different backgrounds. One is Liz Krueger, who is on leave from the Community Food Resource Center, an organization she has run for several years. The other is Robert J. Bellinson, a lawyer who has run against Mr. Goodman in the last two elections.</p>
        <p>The candidates emphasize some of the same issues. Both talk about the need to increase spending on public schools in the district and to build a Second Avenue subway. They both favor more affordable housing and better access to health care.</p>
        <p>Their most prominent disagreement is about who would be the stronger challenger to Mr. Goodman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bellinson asserts that he is better positioned to defeat Mr. Goodman because his previous challenges broadened his name recognition among voters in the district. ''The people who beat incumbents are not the people who come up and run for the first time,'' Mr. Bellinson said. ''The way to beat an incumbent is by running, getting your name known and having people feel comfortable enough with you that they can accept the fact that it is time for a change.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Krueger said she would be a stronger challenger because she had ''a much broader base of support.'' She also raised ''the question of viability,'' noting Mr. Bellinson's two previous losses to Mr. Goodman. ''We can't find anyone else in New York history who has run and won on the third time against the same candidate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bellinson, 35, describes himself as a former all-star softball player who was once a lawyer for the Transit Police Benevolent Association. He calls himself a fiscally conservative Democrat who supports abortion rights, gun control legislation and changes in campaign finance laws. Raised in New Rochelle by parents who were registered Republicans, Mr. Bellinson graduated from Ithaca College and Brooklyn Law School. He said he became interested in politics because of his affiliation with former City Councilman Sal F. Albanese, who was a law school classmate. ''I realized I could make a difference,'' he said. He is now in private law practice in the district, he said Ms. Krueger, 42, grew up in Ridgewood, N.J. Her father, Harvey M. Krueger, vice chairman at Lehman Brothers, the investment banking firm, was the treasurer for the campaigns of former Congressman Andrew McGuire, a Democrat from Bergen County. She said politics was a frequent topic of conversation at home.</p>
        <p>Ms. Krueger graduated from Northwestern University and the University of Chicago, where she earned a master's degree in public policy. Her first job in New York was organizing a food bank in the South Bronx, and she has been involved with antipoverty organizations ever since. She has presented herself as an expert on government financing of food and housing for the poor.</p>
        <p>''I want to shake up Albany,'' she said. ''We need affordable housing -- even here on the East Side. And I want to help people who are frustrated with the educational system and with the health care system. I know I can make a difference.''</p>
        <p>The 26th District includes some of the city's wealthiest areas. It runs from East 14th Street to East 97th Street, generally from the East River to Fifth Avenue above 59th Street and east of Broadwaybelow 59th Street.</p>
        <p>Of the two, Ms. Krueger has made far greater headway in fund-raising. She has collected about $300,000 for her campaign. Mr. Bellinson, who has so far raised about $75,000, has made Ms. Krueger's fund-raising a central theme of his campaign.</p>
        <p>''She has raised a quarter of a million dollars from her mommy and daddy's friends,'' Mr. Bellinson said. ''I think that is bad for democracy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Krueger disagreed. ''I am pleased that my support has been extraordinarily broad,'' she said. ''How does anyone raise money? It's through a combination of people they know and people who are strangers. Do I know people because I've met them through my family? I have, just as Mr. Bellinson has.''</p>
