        <p>IN more than three decades of overlooking Central Park from the fifth floor -- leaf level -- Moisha Blechman has watched the skyline change.</p>
        <p>''We started out well above the treetops, but the trees have grown,'' she said. ''The whole aspect of the park has changed. As the trees have obliterated the original skyline, skyscrapers have gone up above them, so a new skyline has risen well above where those trees will ever go.''</p>

        <p>IN more than three decades of overlooking Central Park from the fifth floor -- leaf level -- Moisha Blechman has watched the skyline change.</p>
        <p>''We started out well above the treetops, but the trees have grown,'' she said. ''The whole aspect of the park has changed. As the trees have obliterated the original skyline, skyscrapers have gone up above them, so a new skyline has risen well above where those trees will ever go.''</p>
        <p>Much of the Blechman family's life has been defined by the park. Ms. Blechman remains friends with many of the parents whose children played alongside her two sons.</p>
        <p>''You form lifelong productive relationships,'' said Ms. Blechman, a former fashion designer who is now an environmental educator. ''The park helps that development because you have a place to meet, to sit and to talk.''</p>
        <p>Today, Central Park West ranks with Fifth and Park Avenues as the city's priciest real estate. It is ''the most desirable avenue on the Upper West Side and arguably in the city,'' said Michael Goldenberg, director of sales for the Halstead Property Company. ''The largest playground in the world, Central Park, is at your front door.''</p>
        <p>The entire avenue below 96th Street is part of the Upper West Side Historic District. It is not entirely residential. There are several churches and synagogues, a handful of private schools and some of the city's museums, including the New-York Historical Society and the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
        <p>''It is the most varied of all the linear avenues,'' said Andrew S. Dolkart, an architectural historian. ''People on Fifth Avenue have a much more beautiful view because Central Park West is more beautiful to look at.''</p>
        <p>Along with ''the typical 12-  to 25-story rectilinear apartment buildings,'' the avenue is home to four great towered buildings -- the Century, the Majestic, the San Remo and the El Dorado -- and the Beresford with its smaller towers, all of which create a ''wonderful rhythm and silhouette,'' Mr. Dolkart said.</p>
        <p>Although an elevated train opened on adjacent Columbus Avenue in 1879, ''most of Central Park West remained vacant land, even during this period of major development, because the land values were too high,'' he said. A notable exception was the Dakota, opened in 1884 as one of the city's first apartment houses for the upper middle class.</p>
        <p>MANY major buildings were constructed between 1928 and 1931. ''On the East Side, the buildings were so exclusive, the address alone sufficed,'' Mr. Dolkart said. ''On the West Side they used the names for marketing. They gave the buildings exotic, pretentious, European-sounding names that would attract attention.''</p>
        <p>A few buildings, like 2 West 67th Street, have side-street addresses, and others, like 1 West 64th Street/41 Central Park West, where the Blechmans live, have two addresses. Why is unclear.</p>
        <p>Below 96th Street, nearly every residential building is a co-op. Classic six-room units predominate. These have two bedrooms, a maid's room, a dining room, a living room and a kitchen, with around 2,200 to 2,400 square feet. ''You have grand, well-proportioned rooms with foyers and high ceilings,'' Mr. Goldenberg said. ''There's molding detail and beautiful hardwood floors. Some have fireplaces.''</p>
        <p>A starting price for a classic six in ''original good condition'' with a park view is around $2.5 million, he said. A classic seven, with one more bedroom, is $2.5 to $3.5 million. Apartments with side views -- or no views -- of the park are less desirable, and prices drop accordingly.</p>
        <p>In one building, the asking price for a classic seven-room apartment on a ground floor with no fireplace and no park view is  $3.5 million, he said. In the same building, the asking price for a classic seven on a higher floor with a fireplace and a park view is $5.595 million.</p>
        <p>People differ on how high is best. Some prefer the fifth through seventh floors, which just about clear the trees. The price differential among floors below tree level is negligible, Mr. Goldenberg said, but clearing the trees could add $400,000.</p>
        <p>Barbara Fox, president of Fox Residential Group, gave the price history for one 10-room co-op. It sold for $2 million in 1985, for $3.2 million in 1987 and for $6.5 million in 1999. ''Today,'' she said, ''it would probably go for $10 million.''</p>
        <p>Just south of 96th Street, a few buildings that are not co-ops lie within a few blocks of each other. The buildings at 350 Central Park West and 360 are large rental buildings; 279 and 353 are condominiums, built about a decade ago.</p>
        <p>Central Park West originates at Columbus Circle where, three years ago, the old Gulf &amp; Western Building was turned into the 52-story Trump International Hotel and Tower, 1 Central Park West. The ground floor includes the restaurant Jean-Georges.</p>
        <p>The hotel occupies floors 17 and below, with the uppermost floors containing 158 condominium units. A one-bedroom, 1.5 bath unit with 1,300 feet, facing away from the park, sells for around $1 million; a five-bedroom, 6.5 bath penthouse with 5,500 square feet is more than $20 million. Two-bedroom units facing the park are in the $2.5 million to $2.7 million range; smaller two-bedroom units facing away from the park hover around $1.6 million.</p>
        <p>The next block up houses the Mayflower Hotel. Just north of that is the Century, 25 Central Park West, now a condominium. The blond Art Deco building was constructed by Irwin Chanin on the site of the old Century Theater.</p>
        <p>''When my uncle built the building he reserved the basement, first and second floors for a restaurant,'' said Michael Mayers, Chanin's nephew, who grew up in the Century and returned after his marriage. ''Either no restaurant met his criteria or he couldn't rent it.''</p>
        <p>The building includes the avenue's only retail pocket south of 100th Street, with a small Gristede's supermarket, Berger Cleaners and Jaros Pharmacy.</p>
        <p>''I grew up with those floors being vacant,'' said Mr. Mayers, a retired venture capitalist. ''In the 1950's the second floor was converted to an apartment and my uncle let Gristede's rent the first floor. There used to be many more older folks in the building who had moved in in the 1930's. The Gristede's used to pack for delivery and they would bring it upstairs.''</p>
        <p>North of 96th Street, where the area is known as Manhattan Valley, the avenue turns more modest, with a mix of co-ops, condominiums and rentals. CPW Towers, a condominium, sits between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue from 97th to 100th Streets. Each of its four buildings has 414 units. (Between Columbus and Amsterdam Avenues is Park West Village, with just under 900 rental units in three buildings.)</p>
        <p>At 100th Street is a small shopping block, which includes an Associated Supermarket, a newsstand, a deli and a cleaners.</p>
        <p>CHANGE is pending. The former Towers Nursing Home on the 105-106th Street block is scheduled to become a 120-unit condominium, the latest in a series of plans for the building.</p>
        <p>The fortresslike building, built in the 1880's as a hospital, was abandoned for two dozen years. By month's end, the current owner, Chris Schlank, expects to close the sale to a Chicago developer, who will renovate the building and erect an adjacent 27-story tower on what is now a parking lot.</p>
        <p>At 108th Street, the tiny AMA Deli Grocery occupies a basement spot. The avenue ends at Towers on the Park, a modern condominium built 12 years ago on the Cathedral Parkway corner.</p>
        <p>''There was a time when there were a lot of shootings and drug dealing,'' said one resident, Susan Wiviott, a planning executive at a social services organization. ''It has gotten better and better.''</p>
        <p>Her end of the avenue feels uncrowded for a city neighborhood, she said. ''When you go farther south you can feel the difference. On the B and C train you can almost always get a seat. By the time you go down two more stops, you can never get one.''</p>
        <p>Some people near the north end of the avenue complain that shopping isn't especially convenient. Stores are either one block away or several, depending on your position along the avenue.</p>
        <p>That doesn't bother Diana Mattson, who moved to the El Dorado at 90th Street last winter after years of living in the suburbs when her husband worked for I.B.M. ''Everybody delivers,'' she said. ''All kinds of food can come to your door.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mattson, a social worker, said that she was shown apartments on Riverside Drive, ''but it is just too far away from Central Park.''</p>
        <p>''I love coming out onto the park and facing the day,'' she said. ''It's exciting. My husband rides from the Claremont Stables. Up in Chappaqua you have to ride in a ring. We recently came across the boathouse, which I had never seen. I know it is not that exciting, but for us it was great.''</p>
        <p>The highlight of the year for Central Park West dwellers is the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The huge balloons are inflated on Thanksgiving eve on the streets surrounding the natural history museum, and the parade floats south early the next morning.</p>
        <p>''We are at the exact height of the balloons, so it is understood you have a certain responsibility, which is to invite all your friends for breakfast to watch the parade,''  Ms. Blechman said. ''This means you have something quite unique in this world.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 10, 2000, Sunday  A map last Sunday with an article about living on Central Park West reversed the positions of two apartment buildings. The Dakota is on the north side of 72nd Street, the Majestic on the south.</p>
