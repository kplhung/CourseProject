      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>IN 1996 the service at Mojave Grill was described in a review as ''in training.'' It's 2000 now, and I wonder if those who graduated from learning the ropes have moved on. Because while shaky service may have been excusable back then, at this stage of the game it is a distracting affront.</p>
        <p>Frankly, I had lost my appetite by the time the entrees arrived one recent evening, having already witnessed a laundry list of blunders: the wine I brought remained in the bag on the table until I extracted the bottles and placed the container under my chair (no chiller was ever provided); we had to summon a waiter to place our order; one appetizer was simply forgotten; and mid-bite into another appetizer I was forced to move my plate to make room for my entree. Nor was it a simple thing to request -- and receive -- two coffees at the end of the meal (another oversight); yet when the bill came, it was barely surprising to find out that we were charged for four.</p>

        <p>IN 1996 the service at Mojave Grill was described in a review as ''in training.'' It's 2000 now, and I wonder if those who graduated from learning the ropes have moved on. Because while shaky service may have been excusable back then, at this stage of the game it is a distracting affront.</p>
        <p>Frankly, I had lost my appetite by the time the entrees arrived one recent evening, having already witnessed a laundry list of blunders: the wine I brought remained in the bag on the table until I extracted the bottles and placed the container under my chair (no chiller was ever provided); we had to summon a waiter to place our order; one appetizer was simply forgotten; and mid-bite into another appetizer I was forced to move my plate to make room for my entree. Nor was it a simple thing to request -- and receive -- two coffees at the end of the meal (another oversight); yet when the bill came, it was barely surprising to find out that we were charged for four.</p>
        <p>With luck, a little regrouping can fix most of these problems. But I worry that the real trouble lies in the attitude nearer to the top, where past praise and crowded dining rooms may have clouded the original desire to prepare creative Southwestern food in an artistic setting.</p>
        <p>Visually, the restaurant suggests  earnest intent. Local artwork hung on the salmon-colored walls creates a sense of intimacy; a small bookcase lined with festive hot sauces adds flair; dreamcatchers and sun-bleached animal horns transport one to a Santa Fe saloon, and certainly the descriptive, enticing and eclectic menu should attract anyone.</p>
        <p>But the lack of consistency in the dishes prepared by the chef, Edward MacKenzie, does not. Already frustrated by the on-again, off-again service, I looked to the food to carry the place. The majority of the appetizers were beautifully arranged, seasonally appropriate and surprisingly (but pleasantly) sweet. The desserts were classics with a spin, addictive rather than complicated.  But when it came to the entrees, deservedly the main attraction, Mojave Grill does not deliver.</p>
        <p>To be specific, three salads -- baby arugula, grilled peach and goat cheese -- were all excellent. The first was littered with pearly white corn kernels, adding a touch of sugar as welcome as a big smile. On top of the arugula was a surprisingly light goat cheese empanada. Pecans added crunch and a lemon vinaigrette offered balance. In the next dish, juicy grilled peaches lay fanned alongside mizuna greens topped with crumbled feta and sweet red onion. Hazelnuts and balsamic vinegar completed the dish. The goat cheese salad (a special), was less complex in texture,  but every bit as flavorful.</p>
        <p>I'd also go back for the charred tomato soup; its smoky flavor adds an earthy tone, as does the cilantro pesto. The grilled artichoke quesadilla was somewhat cluttered by its  eggplant and green chili salsa, but the mild chuhuha cheese within kept it grounded.</p>
        <p>The fish appetizers were equally satisfying: tuna ceviche, was rounded out by an avocado relish, marinated cucumbers, and crisp yucca; sauteed rock shrimp arrived steaming in a bowl brightened with cherry tomatoes, sweet onions, chorizo, garlic and parsley, all accompanied by flour tortillas I was happy to fill.</p>
        <p>But other first courses just didn't work: mahi-mahi escabeche, tossed with lime juice, olive oil and mango, then draped over tostones, had an unfortunate resemblace to fish sticks; the pecan crisp crabcake lay tasteless and limp under a black bean-corn salsa and ancho chile remoulade; and the smoked chicken empanadas, accompanied by an jicama and pepper salad, were weighted with oil and daunting in number.</p>
        <p>While I'm down at this level, I'll move on to the weaker of the entrees. (It seems fitting as both courses did stare up at me simultaneously. Couldn't warming lamps have been used? Or does ''the kitchen is closing'' mean everything out at once? If so, perhaps diners in the second seating shouldn't have to pay as much?)</p>
        <p>In any event, the lump crab ravioli did not meet the expectations set by the menu. I was sure I'd find some woodsy flavor what with ''exotic'' mushrooms and white truffle broth, or at least catch a whiff of the grill from the charred corn, but all these bundles tasted of was the sea, which in the case of crab, seemed fishy. The mushroom taco also showed promise, a blend of summer squash, crema, epazote, and cotja cheese all bound by a squash blossom crepe.  However, the roasted tomato sauce promptly sullied the pale bundle, and after a few bites, it became nothing more than a cold, soggy pancake.</p>
        <p>Grilled mahi-mahi was dry right off the bat (overcooked), and pairing it with a puckery sweet passion fruit vinaigrette and plantains made for a strange sensation. The peppercorn-crusted tuna was so overdone that it had little pinkness left to it. Finally, the adventurous sauteed scallopine of alligator reminded me of veal, that is until the grease kicked in.</p>
        <p>But not all was not lost. The lemony pumpkin-crusted salmon, the peppery horseradish-crusted roasted halibut, and the show-stopping lime braised pork kept me at the table, and all reinforced what I'd learned at the beginning of the meal: that a young talent could be found in the kitchen, one who had evidently temporarily lost his focus.</p>
        <p>Blackberries and nuts permeated the desserts. The tart and sweet warm blackberry tart was tough competition for the sinful buttery bourbon pecan pie. White chocolate worked nicely in the creme brulee, accompanied by a small dish of liqueur-soaked blackberries. The special three-milk cake was juicy and soft, a treat I wish more Southwestern restaurants would offer. The same goes for the bluecorn-pecan biscotti, whose texture momentarily reminded me of bluecorn chips but whose bittersweet finish was directly in line with my closing mood.</p>
        <p>Which is that Mojave Grill is good, yes. But, boy, could it be better.</p>
