        <p>SPRING or autumn, Sicily heads my short list of holiday destinations. It combines sun; good, plain food; natural beauty; and enough history, art and architecture to leave me reeling. What it doesn't promise is a selection of great hotels. Apart from a handful of deluxe establishments in the larger cities and in Taormina, Sicily's innkeepers have been getting a bad press since Goethe bemoaned their shortcomings two centuries ago.</p>
        <p>However, on a spring visit around the island, my husband, Ken, and I saw old hotels being overhauled and old buildings morphing into new hotels with admirable results. We weren't looking for grandeur as much as comfort, charm and a sense of place, and in a 10-day stay we found three special hotels (outside the well-known standards in Palermo and Taormina).</p>
        <p>Starting from Palermo, we circled the island clockwise. After Taormina, we headed for Syracuse. This city, which to fifth-century Greeks was New York to Athens's Washington, traces its origins beyond history to myth, romantic myth at that. The comely nymph Arethusa, pursued across Arcadia by the river god Alpheus, implored Artemis, goddess of virginity, for protection. The goddess answered her prayers, transforming Arethusa into a fountain, in which form she fled to Sicily's eastern coast, settling on the island of Ortygia, the heart of what became ancient Syracuse. Determined to woo her, Alpheus channeled himself across the Ionian Sea, forever to mix his waters with hers.</p>
        <p>Understandably then, a romantic spirit imbues Syracuse, in spite of Athens's bloody defeat there in the Peloponnesian War.</p>
        <p>Grand Hotel</p>
        <p>Not a half mile from Arethusa's supposed fountain stands the 58-room Grand Hotel. Its four-story bulk sits comfortably against the backdrop of Ortygia's medieval fortifications.</p>
        <p>We admired the hotel's neo-Gothic stone details as we parked. Slipping through the snazzy automatic glass doors, we were taken aback by the interior -- a glossy revamp, about five years old, of the pre-World War I hotel. As we signed the register, I admired the flower arrangements. Examining them closely, I was disappointed to discover they were artificial.</p>
        <p>Our second disappointment was the announcement that the elevator was out of order. But the harbor view from our third-floor room proved worth the climb on the polished white marble stairs: fishing boats tied at our feet and the ghosts of Athenian triremes to entertain my imagination.</p>
        <p>The airy room was eminently comfortable, with a firm bed; good reading-in-bed lights; state-of-the-art telephone, unfortunately without dataport (those can be found in rooms on the first floor); and woodwork with whimsical post-Modernist eyebrows and loopholes. The muted multicolored jacquard upholstery was soothing if unmemorable. The bathroom was well fitted, though the shadowy lighting left me wondering about my eyeliner. A convenient outlet for my laptop required some jury-rigging, but the hotel's handyman was as quick to sort out the problem as he had been to see that the elevator was repaired.</p>
        <p>We had arrived at midday, just as the town was tying a collective napkin around its neck, so we headed to the rooftop dining room, hungry but with low expectations.  The classic Italian hotel service -- black tie, comic opera charm and all -- relaxed us after the morning's Sicilian driving. The ethereal sea bass risotto turned our smiles into grins of pampered satisfaction, a sensation compounded by the sunlight tipping the waves in front of us.</p>
        <p>The following two days were packed with visits to Neapolis, the Greek theater and the Latomia del Paradiso (an ancient quarry, now overgrown), never leaving us time to use the hotel's inviting private beach. On Ortygia we admired the cathedral, which incorporates columns from the Temple of Athena, and the handsomely installed Museum of Medieval and Modern Art, with Antonello da Messina's beautiful, if highly restored ''Annunciation.''</p>
        <p>We were especially glad to be staying on tiny Ortygia itself (where there are only two other hotels), able to roam the island's byways into the evening, ogling the Baroque details of small palazzi that are increasingly being restored as ravishing secondary residences, and waltzing across the near-perfect, stagy Piazza del Duomo by moonlight. Each time we left our room, the blinds closed automatically, which we found slightly unnerving.  But each time we returned, we opened them with a press of a button, compounding the theatrical impression Syracuse left on us.</p>
        <p>Eremo della Giubiliana</p>
        <p>This hotel was altogether different, situated deep in rolling countryside south of Ragusa about an hour from Syracuse. Approaching it along the Marina di Ragusa road and passing well-tended farms outlined by dry-stone walls, my husband reminded me that Sicily had been the breadbasket of the Roman Empire. Within the electric gates of the property a bell tower rose over the landscape-hugging whitewashed buildings.</p>
        <p>A charming young man welcomed us, and in impeccable English sketched some of the estate's history as he deftly unloaded our bags and carried them through the arched door into a beamed hall. He explained that the buildings had started life in the 15th century as a hermitage that in time was fortified to guard against Barbary pirates raiding the nearby coast. The property was acquired by the Nifosi family in the 18th century.  Oriental rugs, sofas and exuberant arrangements of field flowers warmed the austere limestone walls and intaglio stone floors.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, the nine rooms and two suites, each with a high iron bedstead, are small, as befits their former role as cells for the community's friars, but the spacious tiled bathrooms, bright with halogen pin spots, are positively sybaritic. In keeping with the building, the  handsome furnishings are spare, with only a few small rugs on the stone tile floors and antique cupboards providing hanging space -- a welcome contrast to the overupholstered clutter of many hotel rooms. Simple wooden lamps provided good bedside lighting.</p>
        <p>Armed with instructions from the desk, we took off on a long ramble around the countryside, accompanied by Pedro, the Eremo's Maremmano sheepdog, who introduced us to the livestock. We paused to take in the sweep of Mediterranean coast only a few miles from the Nifosi family villa and wished it were warmer so we could use the hotel's small, sandy beach. On our way back, we came upon a lush vegetable patch, tended by a voluble gardener. In a Sicilian buzz that bore no relation to my schoolgirl Italian, he described how he sowed his organic rucola (arugula). We parted with more smiles and nods than comprehension, but a conviction that dinner in the vaulted basement dining room would be good.</p>
        <p>And it was: rustic bread to be dipped in olive oil pressed from the fruit of the estate trees, ravioli filled with spicy eggplant, grilled swordfish and beef, and irresistible blackberries. The estate's own wine, a sturdy Il Frate Nero red, suited the fare, and we climbed the stairs to fall asleep to the strains of ''Al di La'' rising from the wedding reception taking place in the courtyard.</p>
        <p>The following day, with advice from the art historian who also manages the front desk, we scouted the enchanted towns of the ''Sicilian Highlands'': Noto, Ragusa and Modica. All were largely constructed after the devastating earthquake of 1693 and reflect the best of Baroque town planning. We wished we had allowed more time for this less visited corner of Sicily and vowed to return. Another time we will take advantage of the hotel's other offerings: small-plane tours of the island and North Africa organized by the Nifosi family, as well as antiquing and horseback expeditions.</p>
        <p>Foresteria Baglio della Luna</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, we headed west to the ruins of Agrigento, the city described by Henry Adams as ''Athens with improvements.'' What was one of Magna Graecia's richest cities boasts a spectacular setting along two ridges rising parallel to Sicily's south coast.</p>
        <p>The Baglio della Luna hotel, off the Porto Empedocle road, sits at the west side of the Valley of the Temples, which, in an unexplained historical misnomer, is not a valley but a ridge overlooking the sea. Among the glorious fifth-century B.C. temples are the nearly intact temple of Concord and the largest of all, the sanctuary dedicated to Olympian Zeus.</p>
        <p>My goggle-eyed rapture with the temples created some traffic risk, so my husband was relieved to reach the classical columns that frame the gate of the Baglio della Luna safely. It opens into a handsome courtyard centered on an ancient stone wellhead. Parts of the Baglio date to the 13th century. Fortified in the 16th century, it served as a manor house from the 18th century until Ignazio Altieri converted it into a 24-room hotel five years ago. Though the Baglio can't lay claim to a location as privileged as the well-known Villa Athena Hotel alongside the Temple of Concord, its decor is altogether fresher and, as we quickly realized, its staff eager to please.</p>
        <p>Occasional antiques, cheerful Italian chintzes and rug-scattered wooden floors define both public rooms and bedrooms. Mr. Altieri has lovingly collected paintings and prints depicting Agrigento's temples since the 18th- century Grand Tour put it on the map as Sicily's most visited archaeological site. The bathroom adjoining our small but cheery bedroom gleamed with white tile (and feebler water pressure than my shower-maven husband prefers).</p>
        <p>After a hot day's temple crawling, I found a chaise longue in a shaded area of the central courtyard ideal for sipping lemonade, thumbing my Thucydides and dozing.</p>
        <p>The magic of the Baglio lies in being able to fling open the shutters at sunrise to the panorama of the limestone temples stretched across their ridge, softened by olive, almond and fruit trees. In the background, modern white buildings rise with the geometry of a Cubist painting, the contemporary town clinging to Agrigento's ancient Acropolis. I revisited the image on a morning wander under the pergolas and palms of the hotel's hillside garden.</p>
        <p>The dining room has the same view, rendered all the more dramatic when the temples are lighted at night, like a golden necklace strung across the landscape. The menu sounded worryingly ambitious but proved very successful, with lightened versions of Sicilian classics like eggplant caponata, wonderful fish and veal and the ice-cream-based desserts for which the island is known.</p>
        <p>As with all three hotels, my only major quibble was breakfast. Italians do not share Anglo-Saxon notions of how to start the day. To please us, hotels up and down the boot of Italy lay out an abundant breakfast buffet. But a sashay along the laden tables reveals packaged crackers, cereals and jams. Even places that pride themselves on homemade breads with lunch and dinner serve cardboard croissants at breakfast. And hardest to swallow: juice fresh from cartons, metallic-tasting when served in sight of orange groves in this country of delicious blood oranges. Fortunately, more and more hotels like the Baglio and the Grand propose some local alternatives at their buffets: prosciutto and salamis along with ripe fresh fruits. And Seattle can only hang its head once you've started the day with Sicilian coffee.</p>
        <p>For the rest we were delighted to have found hotels that were not only comfortable but, by reflecting the best of their localities, also had significantly enhanced our understanding of what the writer Mary Taylor Simeti so fittingly calls Persephone's Island.</p>
