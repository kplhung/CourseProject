        <p>JUST my luck,'' I muttered, gazing at the unattended welcome sign to Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California. ''STOP. Pay $10 here,'' it said. All I had was a $20 bill.</p>
        <p>The temptation was strong to ignore the demand. There was most likely no ranger for miles around. But not wanting guilt to jeopardize a good night's sleep, I placed the bill in an envelope, attached a note asking for $10 change, and included my address. I dropped it into the collection box, never expecting to see my $10 again. I had flown into Reno the night before, so there had been no time to do much damage at the casinos.

        <p>JUST my luck,'' I muttered, gazing at the unattended welcome sign to Lassen Volcanic National Park in Northern California. ''STOP. Pay $10 here,'' it said. All I had was a $20 bill.</p>
        <p>The temptation was strong to ignore the demand. There was most likely no ranger for miles around. But not wanting guilt to jeopardize a good night's sleep, I placed the bill in an envelope, attached a note asking for $10 change, and included my address. I dropped it into the collection box, never expecting to see my $10 again. I had flown into Reno the night before, so there had been no time to do much damage at the casinos. Were my fortunes changing?</p>
        <p>The drive west from Reno that morning had covered 135 miles of wide, green valleys crisscrossed with fast, churning rivers, surrounded by low-lying pine-covered mountains. The landscape became increasingly impressive as stately Lassen Peak rose 10,457 feet above the wooded landscape.</p>
        <p>Lassen Volcanic National Park, with its headquarters in Mineral, Calif., is part of  the Pacific Ring of Fire, the chain of volcanoes along the rim of the Pacific Ocean that includes Mount Shasta in California and Crater Lake National Park in Oregon. Lassen has geologic features similar to Yellowstone's -- steam vents and boiling mud pots -- though on a smaller scale.</p>
        <p>The peak itself is one of the world's largest plug-dome volcanoes (a plug dome is created when a volcano's expanding lava dome becomes so huge that it plugs its own vent). Still considered potentially active, Lassen Peak last erupted in 1914 and 1915. North of the mountain is what's known as the Devastated Area, stripped of all vegetation by the eruptions.</p>
        <p>By the time I reached the park entrance, I had completed 15 of the 17 miles of Warner Valley Road, winding deep into the southern end of the 106,000-acre park from the little town of Chester. My compact rental car bounced and groaned along the rocky, rutted dirt lane that crosses the final three miles to Drakesbad Guest Ranch, the only lodging within the park.</p>
        <p>My visit last summer required getting on the waiting list two years in advance just to try for reservations at one of only 19 spartan, rustic lodge rooms, cabins or more spacious bungalows. The news had come in January, a year and a half later. Thanks to cancellations, the five rooms our group had requested for a weekend were confirmed.</p>
        <p>After a few more jarring moments, I finally spotted the weathered wooden structures of Drakesbad Guest Ranch, nestled among the tall evergreens at the end of the road since 1900.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to Drakesbad,'' Billie Fiebiger said, greeting me warmly as I stepped into the dining hall that doubles as the registration office. With her husband, Ed, Billie runs the ranch during the short June-to-October season. They both know the mountains; Ed is from Garmisch, Germany's well-known ski resort, and Billie is from Bern, Switzerland; they moved here many years ago.</p>
        <p>Though I wasn't scheduled to check in until later that afternoon, Billie welcomed me to a free lunch of salads and make-your-own sandwiches. The rest of my group, which consisted of five families with various ties to our accounting firm in Orange County, Calif., soon arrived in three separate vans from the day's various starting points of nearby Redding, Chico and Red Bluff.</p>
        <p>We have been making these annual scenic outings together for more than two decades. In the early years, the group consisted mostly of myself and a few colleagues, who sought out rugged backpacking adventures. Now, along with a client, we were joined by four spouses and their seven children, ranging in age from 1 to 16.</p>
        <p>Before lunch was over, Billie had taken a genuine interest in helping us with plans for the weekend. Our general idea was to hike to nearby thermal areas that day, then drive over to the west side of the park the next day  to climb Lassen Peak.</p>
        <p>''The younger children can join our kids club, which runs from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.,'' Billie suggested. The older children, she added, could make the 2.3-mile round-trip hike to Devils Kitchen to see the smoking steam vents and bubbling mud pots. The hardiest hikers could continue on to Terminal Geyser, with its spouting 20-foot high steam plume. Everyone seemed agreeable, so we decided to quickly unpack.</p>
        <p>Our rooms were on the second floor of the separate lodge building. They were small,  with wood paneling, one or two beds and half baths. The showers were down by the hot-springs pool, which we would become well-acquainted with after our hike. There are no locks on the rooms (although you can secure the doors from the inside with a chain).</p>
        <p>The lodge's first floor was a single large room with a stone fireplace at one end, comfortably furnished with soft chairs and couches. At the other end was an array of T-shirts and supplies for sale on a self-serve honor basis.</p>
        <p>Soon we were off to Devils Kitchen. The trail wove across a wide meadow and into thick pine woods. Before long, the kids were holding their noses. The distinct rotten-egg smell of sulfur permeated the air. Then there was an opening in the woods and we came to a clearing of desolate beauty. Steam billowed from several pink-yellow, mounded rock cauldrons near and far. The heat and minerals in the steam inhibited plant growth near these fumaroles.</p>
        <p>A teenage boy in our group reveled in ignoring the numerous warning signs to stay well back of the steam vents. Even I leaned in too close to view a boiling mud pot nearby. A large bubble burst from the thick pool of ooze, spraying my hat with hot mud drops; luckily, I was not burned, like others who have ignored warnings posted there. Suitably impressed with the strange phenomenon, we returned to the ranch for a soothing swim in the pool.</p>
        <p>Dinner was a delight. Our table of 16 was by far the largest of a roomful of diners that totaled about 40, mostly families who return year after year. The meal, prepared and served by the friendly ranch staff, was surprisingly ambitious -- mahi-mahi in a pineapple salsa, rice, mixed vegetables, salad and ice cream with caramel sauce. Meals are included in the room price (the nearest restaurant is back in Chester). Several moderately priced California wines and rich German beers were available for an extra charge.</p>
        <p>Later as we congregated around a campfire, the fixings for s'mores appeared from the kitchen. Darkness fell. Soon the kids were wide-eyed, cheeks sticky with marshmallows, listening to one of their fathers  start an eerie tale. They awoke often that night to check under the bed for Big Foot.</p>
        <p>Saturday morning began with hearty breakfast choices of fruits, juices, bagels and muffins, cereals and yogurt, topped off with a hot cheese quiche served at the lodge's dining roomtable.</p>
        <p>Well fortified, the five men in our group plus 10-year-old Monica and 16-year-old Tom grabbed the lunches we had ordered the night before, and set out for Lassen Peak in one family's van. Following Billie's advice, the others decided to seek adventures closer to the ranch.</p>
        <p>We took a costly wrong turn, and by the time we returned to the main road, Route 36, we had lost an hour. Finally, after two and a half hours of driving, we approached the trail head to Lassen Peak.</p>
        <p>Starting up at 11:55, we were eager to reach the summit before lunch. After a rapid start, the pace soon slowed, as the 8,500-foot altitude and steep slope strewn with volcanic rock took their toll, despite perfect weather.</p>
        <p>The gray mountain was still streaked with patches of snow and there were intermittent trees on the lower reaches. We were passed by an adventurer bearing skis, planning a quicker, more challenging descent.</p>
        <p>The steep two-and-a-half-mile trail is popular. For a while, I hiked with a family from Ulm, Germany. I was dismayed to realize that it had taken me and my companions 20 years to discover this gem within our own state, only to find plenty of foreign visitors, including travelers from England and France already enjoying Lassen's splendor.</p>
        <p>Spectacular vistas greeted us at every turn as we moved up the side of the mountain. The volcano is actually just a remnant on the edge of huge Mount Tehama, which collapsed thousands of years ago, forming the fascinating caldera defining the surrounding mountain formations.</p>
        <p>Larry and Jeff, two colleagues and the fastest of our group, reached the summit by 1:15 p.m., with the rest of us staggering over the last boulders at 1:30. At 10,457 feet, we were all a little lightheaded, but energized by our accomplishment. Mount Shasta beckoned nobly in the distance to the northwest.  We feasted on our box lunch -- sandwiches, fruit and chips -- amid the grandeur of this once and future mountain of molten power. Although it was crowded, there was room to stretch out for a nap.</p>
        <p>The hike down was much faster. By 3 p.m. we were driving back to Drakesbad, passing the Sulphur Works thermal area. After a quick stop in Chester for root beer floats, we headed to the ranch for showers and a swim in the lodge's pool.</p>
        <p>We found that the stay-at-homes were looking as weary as we did. Their day had included horseback rides, canoeing on the small, peaceful Dream Lake, and a respectable hike to Terminal Geyser.</p>
        <p>At dinner, we were rewarded with another delicious meal of prime rib, steamed artichokes, mashed potatoes, salad and strawberry cheesecake. Afterward, some in our group still had energy for a round of horseshoes.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, seeking one last adventure, Larry, Jeff and I got up at 6 and hiked a short mile from the ranch to Boiling Springs Lake, one of dozens of fumaroles in the park.  Approaching the rim, we listened as the morning silence was broken by gurgling sounds. All across the 300-yard diameter of the eerie lake, steam rose thickly from the milky surface. The edge was ringed with bubbling mud pots.</p>
        <p>We hurried back to the ranch only to linger over a sumptuous breakfast before leaving. Weeks later, as I thumbed through the mail back home one day, I found an envelope from the National Park Service. Inside was a $10 refund check.</p>
        <p>Where the heat is always set on a boil</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>The closest major airport to Lassen Volcanic National Park is in Reno, Nev., a three-hour drive via U.S. Route 395 and Highway 36. Airline service is also available to Redding, Calif., about 50 miles to the west of Lassen's northern entrance on Highway 44, and Chico, Calif., about 90 miles south of the southwest entrance on Highways 36 and 89.</p>
        <p>Park information can be obtained from the Superintendent, Lassen Volcanic National Park, Box 100, Mineral, Calif. 96063-0100; (530) 595-4444.</p>
        <p>The park is open year-round, but snow makes access difficult in winter and spring.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Drakesbad Guest Ranch, End of Warner Valley Road, Chester, Calif. 96020, is 17 miles north of Chester. To contact the ranch,  messages may be left at (530) 529-1512.</p>
        <p>Reservations and information also can be obtained from California Guest Services, 2150 Main Street, Suite 5, Red Bluff, Calif. 96080.</p>
        <p>The ranch buildings, made of weathered wood, are nestled in the secluded southeastern reaches of the park. It is the only lodging in the park (which also has campsites) and is open from early June through early October. Accommodations include 10 small, rustic lodge rooms and cabins ($108 to $128 a person), 6 one-bedroom bungalows plus a two-unit annex ($125 to $153 a person) and a duplex ($133 a person). Rates include all meals. There are no televisions or phones in the rooms but there is a phone in the main lodge room.</p>
        <p>Restaurants and year-round accommodations are available in the towns of Mineral and Chester -- roughly an hour's drive away. The Bidwell House, 1 Main Street,  Box 1790, Chester, Calif. 96020, (530) 258-3338, www.bidwellhouse.com, is an attractive 100-year-old farmhouse, with a 10-year-old annex with the 14 rooms. Rates are $85 to $190 with tax, including full breakfast.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>The main road winds 30 miles through the park, passing several major sights. The crown jewel is Lassen Peak, a dormant volcano, accessible by a 2.5-mile trail to the summit. Nearby is the Bumpass Hell Thermal Area with boiling springs, mud pots and steam vents.</p>
        <p>North of Lassen Peak is the Devastated Area, stripped of all vegetation by the 1914-15 eruptions. The more remote southern end of the park, near Drakesbad, contains the Devil's Kitchen thermal area, Terminal Geyser and Boiling Springs Lake. Trail rides are available from the stables at Drakesbad. Prices range from $18 for a 45-minute ride to $110 for an eight-hour ride, which includes a bag lunch.</p>
