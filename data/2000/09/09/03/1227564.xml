        <p>SANITATION workers in Cortlandt were a little surprised last month when town officials told them they could no longer wear shorts on the job.</p>
        <p>''The mugginess and the heat has been so intense,'' said Eugene Capicotto, president of the union local representing about 100 sanitation and highway workers. ''They don't know what it is to work the back of a truck.''</p>
        <p>It has always been town policy to bar workers from wearing shorts, but his men have often worn them on the hottest days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Capicotto felt it was time to formalize what had become common practice, so about a month ago he sent a memo to Linda D. Puglisi, the town supervisor, seeking permission to deviate from jeans on days when the temperature exceeds 90 degrees.</p>
        <p>The Town Board refused, citing safety concerns.</p>
        <p>Many towns and cities around Westchester allow outdoor workers to wear shorts during the summer, but most do not, citing safety issues.</p>
        <p>''Long pants protect the legs against insect bites as well as cuts and scrapes,'' said Paula Redd Zeman, the county's commissioner of human resources. ''Shorts, while they may seem comfortable, cause other problems.''</p>
        <p>Linda McMahon of the Yorktown personnel office agreed, saying, ''Highway workers are dealing with asphalt that's hot, there's Lyme disease.''</p>
        <p>Bill Gentry, the parks foreman for the city of Rye, started letting his workers wear shorts eight years ago.</p>
        <p>''It just seems like something you could do for the guys,'' he said, adding that his seven summer workers seemed to appreciate it. ''It's a morale booster.''</p>
        <p>Their counterparts in the city's Public Works Department are given no such privileges, though. ''They're content with it,'' Pamela Fazzino, a department official, said. ''Once you tell them the reasons they're like, 'You're right.' ''</p>
        <p>Of course, summer clothing has always been permitted for some jobs, like golf course employees, camp counselors and mail carriers.</p>
        <p>In Cortlandt, complaints about uniforms have been ongoing, said Thomas Wood, the town attorney, and several workers have been disciplined in the past.</p>
        <p>''We have a bigger problem with work shoes,'' he said, explaining that workers wanted to wear sneakers instead of the approved footwear. ''They just keep trying to do it and the managers have to keep asking them not to.''</p>
        <p>Referring to Cortlandt officials, Mr. Capicotto said, ''We would never go against their orders or they could discipline us,'' but he mentioned his men's ability to improvise. ''A lot of guys cut holes in their pants,'' he said. ''My guys are marines: they'll get along one way or another.''</p>
        <p>Some workers have started wearing shorter pants and one, a college student, cut his jeans lengthwise into five strips. It looked something like a hula skirt, said Mr. Capicotto, who, when he asked for an explanation, was told, ''Geno, I gotta keep cool.''</p>
