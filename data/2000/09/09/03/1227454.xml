        <p>As a producer of television programs, a former advertising executive, a television viewer and consumer, I read Lewis's article with great interest. It may be a huge wake-up call to everyone in the business, but the picture he painted is just the tip of the iceberg. Although he balanced the ''official'' party line (that new black boxes will merely enable the current rulers to make television an even better place) with ''reality'' (that 88 percent of commercials in programs seen by viewers on their black boxes go unwatched), I know that this ''fringe technology'' is just the beginning of a complete overhaul in the way consumers will receive and perceive entertainment.</p>
