        <p>Violent crime in the United States dropped last year to its lowest level since the government began its annual national crime survey 26 years ago. Law enforcement officials credited crime-prevention programs, anti-gun campaigns, more police on the street, tougher sentencing and a healthy economy producing jobs. The rate of violent crime declined 10.4 percent in 1999, the Justice Department said, while crimes against property dropped 8.9 percent. But there still were an estimated 28.8 million violent and property crimes committed last year.</p>
