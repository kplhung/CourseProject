      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>TO hear Chris McQuarrie tell it, the origins of the new film he wrote and directed, ''The Way of the Gun,'' lay in disgruntlement, frustration and anger. We pick up the story about four years ago, shortly after he was awarded the Oscar for his screenplay ''The Usual Suspects.'' At that point, the project that most enthralled Mr. McQuarrie, who appears to be one of those formidably intelligent people who can produce a trove of well thought out, cogently stated reasons in support of his opinions, was to direct the life story of Alexander the Great.</p>
        <p>But the then 27-year-old McQuarrie, author of a screenplay that was nonpareil in its genre, was finding no one who would let him direct a movie about a 20-year-old who had conquered the world. ''It was probably a bad idea to pursue that as the first film,'' he now grudgingly concedes. ''But I decided if I wanted to direct that I should direct other films first. So I came up with ideas for some smaller films. But literally every time I would go to a meeting, the only interest anybody had in me making a film was if it was a crime film. But I didn't want to be the crime guy. So I started lowering my price, and then I started lowering my back end'' -- money to be earned through foreign distribution, cable television or video sales -- ''and then I started lowering my standards, and finally it got to the point when I was in a meeting and I said, 'I will take no salary, I'll take no back end, I'll eat craft service and I will live in the jungle while I make this movie. You decide the budget and the casting, as long as you let me make the film I want to make.' And they still said no.''</p>

        <p>TO hear Chris McQuarrie tell it, the origins of the new film he wrote and directed, ''The Way of the Gun,'' lay in disgruntlement, frustration and anger. We pick up the story about four years ago, shortly after he was awarded the Oscar for his screenplay ''The Usual Suspects.'' At that point, the project that most enthralled Mr. McQuarrie, who appears to be one of those formidably intelligent people who can produce a trove of well thought out, cogently stated reasons in support of his opinions, was to direct the life story of Alexander the Great.</p>
        <p>But the then 27-year-old McQuarrie, author of a screenplay that was nonpareil in its genre, was finding no one who would let him direct a movie about a 20-year-old who had conquered the world. ''It was probably a bad idea to pursue that as the first film,'' he now grudgingly concedes. ''But I decided if I wanted to direct that I should direct other films first. So I came up with ideas for some smaller films. But literally every time I would go to a meeting, the only interest anybody had in me making a film was if it was a crime film. But I didn't want to be the crime guy. So I started lowering my price, and then I started lowering my back end'' -- money to be earned through foreign distribution, cable television or video sales -- ''and then I started lowering my standards, and finally it got to the point when I was in a meeting and I said, 'I will take no salary, I'll take no back end, I'll eat craft service and I will live in the jungle while I make this movie. You decide the budget and the casting, as long as you let me make the film I want to make.' And they still said no.''</p>
        <p>After that meeting, a frustrated and fairly furious Mr. McQuarrie went for coffee with the actor Benicio del Toro and the producer Ken Kokin, both of whom had worked on ''The Usual Suspects.''</p>
        <p>''I was feeling completely miserable,'' Mr. McQuarrie recalled recently during a visit to New York, ''and I said, 'That's it, I'm going to quit this whole business, I'm going to go write books.' And Benicio said: 'It seems that they're willing to let you make a crime film. If you want to say what you want to say, you have to make the movie they want you to make. Why don't you make a crime film?' So I conceded that he was right, and we started thinking about a crime film.''</p>
        <p>But not happily. ''This movie was written from a place of real anger,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. del Toro explained later by telephone: ''Sometimes you get to a point where you think everything is going to be easy, but then there's another mountain to climb. He has so much talent. He just had to use it before time passed him by.''</p>
        <p>''The Way of the Gun,'' which opens Friday, is the story of two sociopaths, Parker and Longbaugh, played by Ryan Phillippe and Mr. del Toro, who decide to kidnap a surrogate mother (Juliette Lewis) and hold her and her unborn child for ransom. As it turns out, the kidnapping becomes a bloody mess, and, what's worse, the man for whom she is carrying the child is mob connected. Soon the screen is populated by a number of very dangerous men, portrayed by Taye Diggs, Nicky Katt and an understated James Caan, none of whom has a motivation that can be described as unalloyed. The movie is tense and twisty; it should now be harder for Mr. McQuarrie to avoid being called the crime guy.</p>
        <p>The idea for the movie was a marriage of Mr. del Toro's coffee shop comment that he had never seen a really interesting kidnapping movie, and a casual remark on the part of Mr. McQuarrie's wife. Heather Neely McQuarrie, a film producer who also served as the costume designer for ''The Way of the Gun,'' happened to mention an article she had read about an executive with a much younger wife who hired a surrogate mother so they could have a child.</p>
        <p>''They were perfectly healthy,'' said Mr. McQuarrie, ''but she didn't want to ruin her body. They hired bodyguards for the surrogate mother. Well, as soon as I heard 'bodyguards,' the movie very easily unfolded. I wrote the first draft in about five days.'' Anger included.</p>
        <p>What was bugging Mr. McQuarrie was the film business. Apart from his personal difficulties, he was angry about the industry's insistence on sympathetic characters. (Many executives found fault with Alexander's precipitous and unattractive post-conquest, third-act decline.) ''I can't tell you the number of times I've heard, 'Well, you'll lose the audience if that character does that,' '' he said. ''It's maddening. It completely takes away the ability to make a three-dimensional character. They want films about crime, but they don't want characters who are criminals. No one ever asked me to change the fact that Person A killed Person B. They just wanted me to give Person A a good reason, a reason why Person B deserved to die. And I found that deplorable, that Hollywood's answer to toning down violence was to work harder at making violence more acceptable, as opposed to taking violence out.</p>
        <p>So when I sat down to write this film, I said fine, if I'm going to write a crime film, I'm going to make a film about criminals. Parker and Longbaugh are unapologetic, unqualified thugs who really don't care who they're hurting or what they have to do to get their way. When my agent read it, he said we're not even going to bother taking it to the studios. They'd have wanted it rewritten. They'd have wanted that scene -- that inevitable, awful scene -- in which the characters explain why they are the way they are and end up blaming somebody else so that you can find them acceptable.''</p>
        <p>Attentive readers will recognize Parker and Longbaugh as the real surnames of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. That's part of Mr. McQuarrie's demythification: Butch and Sundance are pop culture criminal names; Parker and Longbaugh are blotter names, docket names.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillipe said: ''What I remember about reading the screenplay is that as soon as I finished, I started reading it again. So much was conveyed, on so many levels, and you couldn't see things coming. I knew it would be a lot of fun to say his words.''</p>
        <p>''Chris has a gift for storytelling,'' said Mr. del Toro. His charismatic, not-too-talky performance in this film calls to mind James Coburn's in ''The Magnificent Seven,'' only James Dean-ier. ''People could spend years writing and never write a line as good as his.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McQuarrie said that watching movies was ''about all I did'' as a boy. ''A friend and I would take the newspaper every Friday and we would plot the movies that were opening, and we would line up all the times so that we could hit one after the other, right down to the time it would take to travel from one theater to the next,'' he said. But his career in movies almost didn't happen. He was reared in Princeton Junction, N.J., and although he liked to write, he was a poor student and never aspired to college. Instead, he traveled a bit, then took a temporary job, for his uncle's security agency.</p>
        <p>He was mostly a security guard, working, for example, in New Jersey patrolling the construction site of the Freehold Raceway Mall. After four years, he was about to join the New York Police Department -- the broad-shouldered McQuarrie, who speaks in a low rasp, would have been a formidable interrogator -- when he got a call from a high school buddy, Bryan Singer, who was just out of film school. Mr. Singer admired Mr. McQuarrie's writing and shared his critical sensibility. And Mr. Singer had money from investors to direct a movie if only he could come up with a screenplay in 15 days. So Mr. McQuarrie went to work, and three months later they were making a thriller, ''Public Access'' (1992), about secrets in a small town. Three years later they made ''The Usual Suspects.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McQuarrie brought fairly firm ideas to his first job directing. His heroes are John Huston, John Sturges, John Ford and Sidney Lumet -- ''all directors who stay out of the way.'' In a similar way, he is firm about the shortcomings he perceives in his initial effort. ''The films that inspired the visual style of 'The Way of the Gun' are 'Bad Day at Black Rock,' 'The Man Who Would Be King' and 'The Magnificent Seven,' '' he says. ''In all of them the camera remains as far back from the action as possible and just captures the drama. And then when I got there I realized I didn't know enough to create that drama. This film is a visual history of me learning how to direct.''</p>
        <p>THE hardest part was taking charge. ''There's two kinds of people in the film business,'' he says. ''Those for whom it is much easier to say 'please,' and those for whom it is much easier to say 'no.' The people who say please cannot ever say no. I was a please person. As a writer, you kind of have to be. You work to include everybody's vision in your work. Whereas when you're a director, you have to include everybody's work in your vision. I had to become a person who says no. But there I was, on the set, trying to include every idea, giving the actors every single opportunity to do what they wanted. And they were having a great time, but the movie was getting further and further away from where it needed to be.</p>
        <p>''Finally James Caan called me aside and said: 'Let me tell you something. Actors like to be directed. They need direction.' He said: 'This is your film. Quit messing around, and go tell those people what to do.' And that's what I started to do. But it was very difficult. I felt most like the novice.''</p>
        <p>Mr. del Toro, for one, disagrees. ''I never saw it,'' he says. ''I say he looked like a director who was doing his 10th film.'' One day it was determined Mr. del Toro's character needed to steal a car, only there wasn't one with fake windows available. ''He just led us out to the street and had me smash a real window,'' Mr. del Toro recalls. ''He was commanding. It was thrilling.''</p>
        <p>One person director McQuarrie had no trouble saying no to was screenwriter McQuarrie. He happily tells about a scene in which Parker in a long monologue explains to the surrogate mother how he and his partner differ from her and other ''civilians.'' ''He tells her that she has a lie she tells herself so that she can get out of bed in the morning,'' Mr. McQuarrie explains, ''And it's a lie that says there's only two ways that you die -- that it was your time, or that you had it coming. But, he says, guys like Parker and Longbaugh know that there's only one way you die, and that's that you were in the way.</p>
        <p>''As we go in, Ryan asks for a sandwich -- he wants to be eating in the scene. He does the scene beautifully -- he's phenomenal. When he finishes, I let the camera run. There was a long silence, and then Juliette ad libs, 'Are you going to eat the rest of that sandwich?' And then he ends up giving her half the sandwich. And it was great.</p>
        <p>''But when we got to the cutting room, I realized that was the first time they'd really spoken to one another, and he wouldn't have told her those things. So we cut the monologue and kept the sandwich. And I was perfectly content. This was one of the places where I was venting my anger. Once I was in the cutting room, I could tell the difference between what was anger and what was story.''</p>
        <p>This McQuarrie is a tough-minded fellow: reputations could be built on what he throws away.</p>
        <p>Mr. McQuarrie is considerably less angry today. ''I've accepted that when people hire you to write a screenplay, it's not your movie, it's their movie,'' he says. He is currently working on a screenplay for ''The Green Hornet.'' He and his wife have recently settled in Seattle and are expecting their first child. ''I don't know how I lived in Los Angeles for eight years, '' he says.</p>
        <p>''Most people there are frightened, but they're never frightened of the things that can actually kill them, the earthquakes and the fires and the gangs. They're oblivious to that. What they're afraid of is their status and people's impressions of them.'' He says he'd like to direct again; in the end, he says, it was fun. And he's still interested in Alexander the Great.</p>
