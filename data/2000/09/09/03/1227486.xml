        <p>The wildfires that have swept through parts of a dozen Western states this summer, destroying homes, businesses and millions of acres of recreational land, have also disrupted or ruined vacations and crippled businesses dependent on the tourist trade.</p>
        <p>''It has been an absolute disaster for campers, hikers, rafters and other outdoorsmen over a big portion of the West,'' said Dorothy Maitland, the owner of Travel by Maitland, a tour operator in Kalispell, Mont.</p>
        <p>A major entrance to Yellowstone National Park was closed for several days in mid-August, Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming was shrouded in smoke, and fear of wildfires kept visitors away from Glacier National Park in Montana. Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado, a trove of ancient cliff dwellings and ancient Anasazi artifacts, was closed twice for a total of almost three weeks before reopening Aug. 14.</p>
        <p>Although small businesses near recreational areas have suffered and individuals have had to change camping and hiking plans, tour operators in the affected states  had surprisingly few cancellations. They juggled schedules; when the south entrance to Yellowstone was closed, some went in via the west, said Keither Griffall, chief executive of Western Leisure in Salt Lake City. ''It took another three hours or so, but by staying in close touch with the Forest Service we were not badly affected.'' And as long as visitors do not think they are in danger, he said, many of them enjoy what he described as ''a little spice'' during their tours.</p>
        <p>While Mesa Verde was closed, Tauck Tours of Westport, Conn., rescheduled tours to Aztec Ruins National Monument in New Mexico. ''We had a lot of people calling to inquire,'' said Phil Otterson, a vice president, ''but we had very few cancellations.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Maitland, a former president of the National Tour Association, said that there was a falloff in early August, but that tours picked up when her company stuck to most itineraries and rescheduled others. ''But it was definitely a challenge,'' she said.</p>
