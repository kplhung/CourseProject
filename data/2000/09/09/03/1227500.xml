        <p>WHEN the work of a great artist like Mozart, Chekhov or Petipa is reconsidered by an inspired interpreter, the results often reveal new facets of an original masterpiece. Such may prove to be the case at the Balanchine Festival, which begins in a little over a week at the Kennedy Center in Washington. In a millennium tribute to the  choreographer, a remarkable gathering of 6 companies will dance 14 of his ballets from Sept. 12 through 24.</p>
        <p>The festival does not claim to be as comprehensive as the New York City Ballet's yearlong survey of Balanchine in 1994, or even a collection of seminal works. (His first great work, ''Apollo,'' is not on the schedule.) Rather, its distinction should lie in providing a new understanding of the Balanchine canon.</p>
        <p>When planning for the festival began more than two years ago, said the Kennedy Center's president, Lawrence J. Wilker, ''it was a major commitment on our part, and we knew it would cost us millions.'' The costs are so large because of the number of companies participating and the two-week run (the longest dance festival at the center in more than five years).</p>
        <p>Charles and Stephanie Reinhart, Kennedy Center's artistic directors for dance, who conceived the project, first approached the New York City Ballet as a participant.</p>
        <p>''They were not able to,'' Mr. Reinhart explained, ''because basically the New York City Ballet has a contract with the musicians saying when they appear, the orchestra goes with them. The Kennedy Center Orchestra has a contract with its musicians that says any visiting company has to use them. So there you have it.''</p>
        <p>A serendipitous outcome of this stalemate is the chance to see Balanchine's ballets from well qualified viewpoints other than that of the New York City Ballet. Peter Martins, artistic director of the company, worked closely with Balanchine in the choreographer's later years, but so did several others who have had almost no artistic input with the company since Balanchine's death in 1983. Among them are such stellar names as Suzanne Farrell, Helgi Tomasson, Edward Villella, Violette Verdy and Allegra Kent, all of whom have directed or coached companies appearing in Washington.</p>
        <p>Barbara Horgan, director of the Balanchine Trust, which licenses his work, said Balanchine's ballets were sought worldwide in the last decades of his life. The demand  since his death has become even greater: 273 companies in 45 countries have asked the trust for permission to perform them.</p>
        <p>The groups dancing at the Kennedy Center -- the San Francisco, Miami City and Pennsylvania Ballets, the Suzanne Farrell Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago and members of the Bolshoi Ballet -- are a small but significant part of the Balanchine diaspora.</p>
        <p>Their common thread is Balanchine, but they are strikingly different in their size, histories and approach. All the directors value his consummate musicality, speed and clarity, but like the blind men and the elephant, each has a different view of the value the master's work has for them.</p>
        <p>Edward Villella began the Miami City Ballet from scratch in 1986 in a place without a strong ballet tradition. ''For me it was critical from the very beginning to talk to my audience because I knew I was bringing a repertoire they were unfamiliar with,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he was educating his young company as well. ''Balanchine works were milestones in our development,'' Mr. Villella continued. ''One of our last achievements was 'Agon.' It is one of his greatest works, but you can't just do the steps. You have to have an internal understanding of its contemporary energy, its dimensions and layers, to present it in its full complexity.''</p>
        <p>The director has mounted the evening-length ''Jewels,'' bringing in the three great original ballerinas to coach his dancers: Ms. Verdy, Patricia McBride and Ms. Farrell. His company will dance the full work when it returns to the Kennedy Center next spring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villella was also part of the creative mix of ''Jewels.''  Balanchine tapped into his brilliant athleticism in the ''Rubies'' section of ''Jewels,'' which the company will dance opening week in addition to ''Agon,'' ''Stars and Stripes'' and ''The Four Temperaments.''</p>
        <p>In contrast to Miami, the San Francisco Ballet has strong historic links to Balanchine. His first American Apollo, Lew Christensen, was its longtime director. Mr. Christensen's successor, Helgi Tomasson, was one of Balanchine's most classically elegant male dancers in the 1970's and originated a role in the 1972 ''Symphony in Three Movements.'' His company will dance that at the festival as well as ''Symphony in C'' to the Bizet score.</p>
        <p>''I have a big company and a lot of principal dancers who are very good in those roles,'' Mr. Tomasson said.  ''I thought it would be in our interest and the festival's to have these large works. Also we wanted to show Balanchine's diversity, so we're dancing 'Bugaku' and 'Prodigal Son,' two very distinctive ballets.''</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Tomasson, Roy Kaiser directs a company with deep Balanchine roots -- the Pennsylvania Ballet. Although Mr. Kaiser never worked with the choreographer, his company was founded by a Balanchine protege, Barbara Weisberger; two of its subsequent directors, Robert Weiss and Christopher d'Amboise, were important dancers in the New York City Ballet.</p>
        <p>The Pennsylvania company has a significant Balanchine repertory. This year in Philadelphia it will open its season with an all-Balanchine program, dance the choreographer's celebrated version of ''The Nutcracker'' at the holidays and conclude with his ''Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Mr. Kaiser is fervent about staging these well. He has brought in Ms. Verdy and Ms. Kent to coach his dancers; Ms. Kent even went to Philadelphia last season to dance the role of the mother in a weekend's worth of ''Nutcrackers.''</p>
        <p>The Joffrey Ballet of Chicago has only three Balanchine ballets in its active repertory, two of which it will dance at the festival: ''Square Dance'' (in the original version with a caller) and ''Tarantella Pas de Deux.'' The artistic director, Gerald Arpino, points to the company's singular artifact, a reconstruction of Balanchine's 1932 ''Cotillion,'' not currently in the company's active repertory. ''The stylistic sophistication of this early work is extraordinary,'' Mr. Arpino said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrell, for whom Balanchine created roles that captured both her daring and her mystery, has a small ad hoc ensemble that has given memorable performances at the Kennedy Center, a sponsor of her work. Last year her group danced the soaring slow movement of ''Divertimento No. 15'' on the small terrace theater stage with taped music.  At the festival, it will appear on the Opera House stage dancing to live music and with more dancers, so she can present the whole ballet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farrell said there was nothing like dancing Balanchine to realize how far he took ballet. ''You can observe his ballets,'' she said. ''But when you physically have to challenge yourself to do them, it's entirely different. Mr. Balanchine gave me freedom, and I think I convey that idea to my dancers.'' The celebrated ballerina has also been working with the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow.</p>
        <p>''Everyone responds to music a little differently,'' Ms. Farrell said, speaking of the score for ''Mozartiana.'' ''And the Bolshoi dancers understand Tchaikovsky very well -- even the orchestra plays it differently -- they understand all that pathos.  You have to hear it the way they hear it. That opens my way of looking at the ballet in teaching it to them.''</p>
        <p>Nina Ananiashvili, who dances with American Ballet Theater and the Bolshoi, said she relished working with Ms. Farrell. ''Balanchine uses all the classic steps, but with more freedom,'' Ms. Ananiashvili said. ''Because I work with Suzanne a lot, I have this feeling I'm a little close to Mr. B., and this is an absolutely great feeling.''</p>
        <p>Aleksei Fadeyechev, artistic director of the Bolshoi, said: ''Balanchine is the classical master after Petipa. Teaching us his ballets, Suzanne Farrell did a great job of changing a little the style, the way of practicing, the way we work.''</p>
        <p>The Bolshoi is known for its powerful, overtly dramatic ballets. ''But,'' said Mr. Fadeyechev, ''with 'Agon,' there's a drama that's made by the choreography. All our dancers do the same steps exactly, but because the dancers in the different casts feel it differently, the audience can see that change.''</p>
        <p>What the Bolshoi has learned about Balanchine could be applied to the response of all the directors and dancers coming to the festival. Some of the differences in style and musical response may be obvious; others more subtle. Still, if genius is in the details, the festival may be not only high entertainment (Balanchine's stated goal for his ballets) but a revelation as well.</p>
