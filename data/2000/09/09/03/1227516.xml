        <p>FOR 340 years after the Pilgrims settled here, Plymouth and its neighbors in southeast Massachusetts grew very slowly. Then in 30 years, from 1960 to 1990, the population of this 103-square-mile town, the state's largest municipality and still a sizable slice of cranberry growing country, tripled.</p>
        <p>Better transportation, good schools, lots of land, reasonable prices and proximity to the jobs in Boston and its beltways attracted families seeking single-family houses in traditional subdivisions.</p>
        <p>While eager for growth, this town of 50,000 residents and its neighbors in the still rural region began feeling overwhelmed and took various planning measures to deal with the rapid expansion. But that boom seems modest compared to what is coming: megaprojects.</p>
        <p>In Plymouth, construction is under way on a 3,000-acre mixed-use project with almost 3,000 luxury houses that will be the town's biggest development so far. That project, called Pinehills, will in turn be dwarfed by another being planned by the A. D. Makepeace Company, a major cranberry grower. The company has filed preliminary plans for tract subdivisions that could contain 3,000 to 7,000 houses on 9,600 acres spanning Plymouth, Carver and Wareham.</p>
        <p>The megaprojects have brought worries for these communities.</p>
        <p>''The towns are scared to death of losing their open space and having a demand for services -- schools, water, sewer and fire protection -- they can't provide,'' said John Lenox, the town planner here. ''So they've enacted building caps, moratoriums; increased minimum lot sizes; or overencouraged commercial development, all of which consumes twice as much open space.''</p>
        <p>While Plymouth has a full-time government and a professional town planner able to promulgate sophisticated zoning, its small neighbors have only part-time officials, explained Steven Smith, executive director of the Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development District, a federally financed agency working with all of the towns and developers.</p>
        <p>''The region isn't prepared for the growth that's coming,'' he said. ''Most of the zoning doesn't give the towns or developers much choice other than large-lot, single-family subdivisions that spread all over the hills.''</p>
        <p>Basically, Mr. Smith and others worry that the 51 towns from Duxbury (about 30 miles south of Boston) to Westport (just shy of the Rhode Island border) will not have the tax base to deliver resident services or the regulations to prevent the still sparsely settled hills, bogs and beaches from being plowed under or polluted.</p>
        <p>Part of the growing attraction of this area is that it is one of few regions in eastern Massachusetts with moderately priced single-family houses. The average selling price in Plymouth this summer was $204,682. In Boston it was $823,000 for a house of fewer than 2,400 square feet; for a larger house, it was $1.4 million, said Debra Taylor, owner of Link, a real estate information service in Boston.</p>
        <p>BUYERS like Michael Bash found both more house and a country way of life in Plymouth that is not available closer to his Boston-based cleaning company. Last fall Mr. Bash; his wife, Ellen; and their two daughters moved into a 2,800-square-foot four-bedroom house in Harrison Woods. This 32-lot subdivision, deftly tucked into a wooded 125-acre site, has a private 22-acre pond good for swimming, fishing and kayaking. House prices range from about $300,000 to $400,000, said Vivian Mulligan, who with her husband, Patrick, is the developer.</p>
        <p>''Plymouth has breathing room,'' said Mr. Bash, who moved here from Hull, a tightly packed beach resort just south of Boston,  where he had lived for 40 years. ''You have your privacy and nice neighbors, excellent schools, more house for your money. And the extra commute isn't much.''</p>
        <p>Mulligan Homes bought the site, a former Boy Scout camp, in 1997 and started construction the next year. The first buyers moved in last year. Now 20 homes are occupied, six more are being built and the Mulligans are holding the last six lots as an investment. They expect to complete construction of the 26 homes and the surrounding roads by mid-2001.</p>
        <p>For decades, Harrison Woods and similar subdivisions have fed the growth here. Now a new era of larger-scale development is dawning as construction on the $1 billion Pinehills proceeds.</p>
        <p>Three years of planning will result in 2,854 attached and detached houses priced from about $300,000 to more than $1 million. The houses will be in clusters, and the 3,037-acre forested site will include about 2,000 acres of open space offering residents -- mostly empty nesters and retirees -- panoramic views of Cape Cod Bay, woods and four golf courses.</p>
        <p>The developer, Pinehills L.L.C., has construction financing from the Fleet National Bank division of the FleetBoston Financial Corporation.</p>
        <p>So far, it has built one mile of roads with underground utilities, a private well, a 7,400-square-foot office building called the Summerhouse and seven model homes set for completion in October, when marketing will begin. Of four golf courses planned, two are in construction along with a village center, which will have 1.3 million square feet of commercial space: a hotel, conference center, retail and offices. The land planner is Sasaki Associates of Watertown, Mass.</p>
        <p>Seeing the megaprojects approach, in the mid-1990's Plymouth enacted new zoning bylaws. They allow cluster designs for projects that leave three acres per house somewhere on the site and special permits for more dense developments like Pinehills. On parcels of 3,000 acres or more, the new zoning allows overlay districts, where mixed-use projects can be built in areas zoned residential or agricultural. Because an annual building cap of 185 houses took effect last year, about 200 new houses are going up now, compared with 287 in 1999 and 336 in 1998.</p>
        <p>Some local and regional planners point to the cluster-zoning approach taken by Pinehills, which is conserving 70 percent of the site as open space and building private infrastructure, when they contemplate what might happen to the vastly larger property being developed by the Makepeace Company.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Lenox, the town planner, ''Pinehills is a positive alternative to the threat of Makepeace.''</p>
        <p>Makepeace owns 13,000 acres in the area. It is considering building houses on 9,600 acres, which it could also cultivate, but it is now growing cranberries on only 1,750. Recently, as cranberry prices fell and home prices rose, the company began focusing on real estate development.</p>
        <p>What worries Mr. Lenox is that the company ''might take 9,600 acres out of agricultural use to build thousands of houses in sprawling subdivisions that we can't serve.''</p>
        <p>This summer Makepeace started working with regional and town planners to develop an alternative to traditional subdivisions that would enable it to continue its agricultural activity and leave open space as well.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this, the company hopes the towns will change their zoning to allow New England village style clusters of luxury houses, a conference center, hotel and golf courses, said John O. Drew, chairman of Makepeace's real estate arm, Sassomon Holdings.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to do sprawling subdivisions, but we will if that's the only way to protect shareholder value,'' said Mr. Drew, a member of the Makepeace clan, which owns 80 percent of the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, the regional planner, said, ''The challenge is to rewrite the zoning so this project is an asset rather than a blight.''</p>
        <p>In its attempt to cope, the 35-square-mile town of Carver introduced a 30-house building cap townwide this summer and a special permit for cluster zoning, which could mean lengthy negotiations with developers.</p>
        <p>''The idea isn't to be difficult, but for the town to have some control as we work with each developer,'' said Sarah Hewins, a planning board member.</p>
        <p>Effective planning and good design will indeed determine the impact of future growth on all of these towns, said Mr. Bash of Harrison Woods. But he is certain of one thing: buyers will keep coming.</p>
        <p>''People need someplace to live,'' he said. ''And this is such a beautiful commute, a few times I drove right past my exit.''</p>
