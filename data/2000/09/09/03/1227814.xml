        <p>A Chinese proverb says, ''You cannot be called a hero if you've never been to the Great Wall.'' Forty-five athletes who ventured halfway around the world to Beijing believe in a different version: ''You can't be called a marathoner until you've run the Great Wall Marathon.''</p>
        <p>They embraced the challenge last week, drawn by the romance of running with 1,000 years of history wearing the treads on their sneakers.</p>
        <p>''Parts of the course crumbled under my feet,'' said Riccardo Gross of Italy, who won in 2 hours 35 minutes 8 seconds last Wednesday. ''Many bricks were completely missing from stairways.''</p>
        <p>It didn't slow down Gross, who broke the course record of 2:45:00, held by Stefan Schlett of Germany, and who bested his own winning time last year by more than five minutes.</p>
        <p>The athletes had to share ledges and narrow passageways with several runners at once at various split times on the four-lap course. Competitors slithered across the ledges, grasping the stones of small openings once used to aim weapons, in an effort to steady their tired legs.</p>
        <p>They crawled up and down small dungeon-type stairwells, and climbed out windows that provided a picture-perfect view of the rest of the Wall snaking across the distant rolling green mountainside toward western China, a journey of 4,000 miles.</p>
        <p>Runners barely took three strides without facing steps of all shapes and sizes, 60,000 in all, dominating a course devoid of flats. Athletes were forced to scale everything from 3-inch and 5-inch risers to steps as high as their kneecaps. Centuries of decay often left small stones and dust as the only foothold on this section of the Wall built during the Ming Dynasty.</p>
        <p>Footing was perilous, demanding constant attention, but running the Wall, an architectural fortress that was built to keep out pillaging nomads, was captivating. ''When I crossed the finish line I was disappointed I had to stop,'' said Elke Peischl of Germany, the first-place woman in 3:04:30. ''It was just too much fun.''</p>
        <p>She estimated the course to be three-and-a-half miles short of the traditional marathon distance of 26 miles 385 yards. Peischl, 42, a former champion rock 'n' roll dancer until a head injury ended her career, attributed her performance to cross-training. ''Mountain biking is probably better preparation for this race than running,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For runners who lacked a diverse training routine, the physical demands of climbing and crawling gave new meaning to the phrase ''hitting the wall.''</p>
        <p>''My time was an hour worse than my average,'' said Jim Bates, 42, a United States Army lieutenant colonel from Hopewell, Va. Sick to his stomach after finishing in 3:51:42, he leaned over the Wall for relief.</p>
        <p>The Great Wall Marathon, which is in its fifth year, was created by Wichard Holscher, an architect from Munich. Armed with pointer and blueprints, Holscher delineated course obstacles in a prerace meeting, warning runners of hazards such as stairs sloping backward and drain risers resembling road bumps.  Holscher organizes three adventure marathons a year, including one in the Arabian Desert.</p>
        <p>''I saw a slide show on the Great Wall and thought, why not a marathon?'' said Holscher, who has competed in three Ironman triathlons. The triathlons proved endurance training for doing business in China as Holscher untangled the red tape inherent in organizing a marathon in a country heavily regulated by the Communist government.</p>
        <p>''I must have faxed over 300 letters to the ministries of sport, culture and security,'' Holscher said. ''It took over a year to organize the first race.''</p>
        <p>Chinese officials limited the race to 80 competitors, a number that included runners from a 10-kilometer race and a half-marathon. The races took place 100 miles northeast of Beijing, in Jin Shan Lin.</p>
        <p>Green and blue beach umbrellas peering over the wall indicated water stops and control points where each runner's number duly recorded by race officials. There were no portable toilets provided, requiring runners to climb off the wall if the need arose.</p>
        <p>Although overcast skies kept temperatures down to 80 degrees, a morning mist ensured humidity of more than 95 percent.</p>
        <p>''I was happy to see every water stop,'' said Knox White, of Eldorado, Ark., one of six Americans who raced. White, 62, finished in 5:12:25.</p>
        <p>White is no stranger to adventure, having run 52 marathons and canoed around New York City with knowledge of the notorious tides. What set him on this adventurous lifestyle was a tragic automobile accident in 1986 in which his 16-year-old daughter, Angie, died.</p>
        <p>''It totally changed my life,'' White said. ''I worked all the time and never took vacations. Now, I make sure to enjoy life.''</p>
        <p>Runners snacked on packed lunches and took pictures of friends as they waited for hours for others to finish the race. Masseuses rubbed down sore calves and backs on portable tables set up on a terrace next to the finish line.</p>
        <p>Everyone's eyes were on the last runner, Bob Platt, of Cincinnati, struggling along the Wall's exposed stairways, still a mile away. And cheers echoed over the countryside, as he lunged for the finish in just over six and a half hours, gripping his water bottle and wincing from cramps and physical exhaustion.</p>
        <p>Chinese firecrackers snapped, crackled and popped, preceding an awards ceremony complete with theme music from the Olympics sounding from a black boom box on the ancient Great Wall.</p>
