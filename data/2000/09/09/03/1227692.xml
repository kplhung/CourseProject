        <p>IT was 7 p.m. on a Tuesday, so Alex Dimitrov lounged in the corner booth of his then-quiet restaurant, Mehanata, smoking one Rothman's Special cigarette after another.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dimitrov, 33, whose restaurant is now a center for the city's growing Bulgarian community, said the white pages introduced him to this world and his clientele.</p>
        <p>He arrived in New York seven years ago, knowing no one and speaking no English. He looked for anything Bulgarian but found nothing. ''I didn't know what to do,'' he said. Finally, he looked up his own last name in a phone book. Dimitrov is a common Bulgarian name, and when he called the number he found a friend.</p>
        <p>''Nazdrave!'' (''Cheers'') he said, grinning and lifting a glass of red Mehnada, one of Bulgaria's many prized wines. These days, he is the friend offering the welcoming toast, the owner of the only Bulgarian restaurant in New York. (The next closest is believed to be in Virginia, although there is a dessert cafe, Magura, in Forest Hills, Queens.)</p>
        <p>In the nearly two years since he opened Mehanata on Broadway at Canal Street in Chinatown, he and his tavern have built a reputation for nurturing the Bulgarian community, which has grown considerably since the country's Communist rulers finally lost power five years ago.</p>
        <p>''When you do things for the community, you go to him because he will help,'' said Dimitar Kovachev, a 50-year-old financial broker. ''He is the real center for the Bulgarian community because without his restaurant there is nowhere to go.''</p>
        <p>Mehanata (the name means tavern) sits on the second story of a corner building, its bright green awning visible from the street. Along the stairwell is a pastoral mural of cottages and churches, and past the arched entry is a cozy room with stone floors and wood-paneled walls adorned with plates, crests and flags. Mr. Dimitrov designed the decor to feel familiar, homey.</p>
        <p>That idea applies to the traditional fare, which is mostly grilled and tastes a lot like Greek food. The shopska salad, for example, which literally translates as ''salad for people with wooden heads,'' or for the strong-willed, is made up of green peppers and cucumbers topped with Bulgarian feta cheese, a sharp-tasting cousin of the Greek cheese.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dimitrov attracts other Eastern Europeans with Ukrainian/Russian/Gypsy night on Thursdays and Hungarian discotheque night on Saturdays. But he saves Friday nights for his Bulgarians.</p>
        <p>At Mehanata, they have a place to hear folk bands and pop stars who are famous back home. And they have a place to get to know each other, a place where everyone knows their language, if not their name.</p>
        <p>''New York is such an immigrant city; the bravest people are here,'' Mr. Dimitrov said. ''It's a challenge for everyone, and that's why it's beautiful. But it's nice to help a community grow here because no matter how long I live in America, I'm Bulgarian.''</p>
