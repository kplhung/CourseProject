        <p>The Alphabet in My Hands</p>
        <p>A Writing Life.</p>
        <p>By Marjorie Agosin.</p>
        <p>Rutgers University, $24.</p>
        <p>''Beyond / the momentary / light / you were there, word, / mother tongue, / aroma, / dominion of memory,'' the poet Marjorie Agosin writes in her memoir, ''The Alphabet in My Hand.'' ''I who lack roots, / times, borders. . . . I lament vanished things, / thimbles, butterflies, / but most of all my mother tongue, / cut away in the midst of my life.'' With these words she reopens the wounds of separation. Born Jewish in predominantly Roman Catholic Chile, she spent her childhood aware of the ''always-present differences'' that separated her -- pale-skinned, blue-eyed and without a proper pedigree -- almost equally from the societies of her privileged playmates and the indigenous women who cared for her. After the assassination of Salvador Allende Gossens, Agosin, then an adolescent, fled with her family, which settled in Georgia. But exiled from the language, food, flowers and herbs of the Andes, she considered herself ''disappeared,'' like the classmates who vanished in Pinochet's Chile. Through poems and vignettes -- some mere pauses between larger thoughts -- Agosin describes being ripped from the womb of the familiar. She paints her experiences in luminous, measured prose, deftly translated from the Spanish by Nancy Abraham Hall. Though she avoids the restriction of time, flitting haphazardly from event to perception, Agosin succeeds in conveying the displacement that defines her life still as a wife, mother and Spanish professor at Wellesley College. Near the book's end, she gazes out from the airplane that has transported her and her children back to her birthplace and finds she has come full circle. ''We have arrived, I tell them, and the day changes color,'' she writes. ''Time, borders, memory and forgetting are no longer. This is where we are from, I tell them.''</p>
