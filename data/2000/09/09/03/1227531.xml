        <p>THEY'RE teaching ancient Greek in Riverhead and Chinese in Great Neck. Jericho High School students enroll in an emergency medical technician class. In Syosset, middle-school students are learning how to get rich; in Eastport, elementary-school students are learning how to be virtuous.</p>
        <p>Reading, writing, and arithmetic, the bedrock of school curricula for generations, are no longer enough, many Long Island educators say, to prepare their students for the challenges of the new century.</p>
        <p>''The world is much more complex than it used to be,'' said Jean L. Clark, principal of the South Woods Middle School in Syosset, explaining why the school now offers eighth graders an elective Wall Street-Madison Avenue course in which students develop business plans, create their own mock enterprises, sell the concept to their peers and issue fake stock for fake investment capital.</p>
        <p>In addition, they tour the New York Stock Exchange and Federal Reserve in Manhattan, are lectured by parents and account executives from firms like Smith Barney, and participate in a statewide competition in which they create their own portfolios and spend a fictitious $100,000 to research, buy and sell stocks.</p>
        <p>''The money is theoretical,'' said Arthur Goldstein, chairman of the business education and family and consumer science departments in the Syosset school system. ''But the course and the competition teach kids that these things are real and involve risk, and how hard it is to be successful making money. They learn a lot when they're not successful -- that investments are more than buying and selling paper. They create capital that fuels the economy of our country.''</p>
        <p>The Madison Avenue component of the course, he said, ''teaches kids who are exposed to so much TV and the Internet how advertising influences their lives as well as businesses and consumers, and that the world of business and advertising is not male-dominated.''</p>
        <p>The course is a springboard to high-school courses in investment decision-making, sports marketing, business research and ownership, and restaurant management, among others. They can earn college credits through Long Island University, and ''about 80 percent of colleges accept these credits,'' Mr. Goldstein added.</p>
        <p>Jenna Rosenfeld, who took the Wall Street course at Syosset's H. B. Thompson Middle School last year, said, ''My mother belongs to an investment club and my father invests in the market, so the course gave me a better understanding of a subject that's a big part of everyone's life.''</p>
        <p>Also on the Syosset middle school menu is ''Latin at Lunch,'' in which students meet in the cafeteria to learn about the roots of English words, study Roman culture and architecture, and hold toga parties.</p>
        <p>At Great Neck South High School, Phyllis Trautman Chen has taught Mandarin Chinese for the past four years. ''Today, with so many American companies doing business with China,'' Mrs. Chen explained, ''increasing numbers of students are interested in the country and its language. It's the same kind of interest American students used to have in Russian, but now they seem to be bitten by the China bug.''</p>
        <p>Tim Gurba, 18, took the Chinese course for four years before graduating last June.</p>
        <p>''At first, I took the course because my dad pretty much mandated it. He thought it would be good for my future. But the course more than fulfilled my expectations,'' he said. ''Even in a daily sense, I found the language to be just as useful as Spanish, and as far as the future, there is no telling what sort of global economic impact China is going to have, so knowing the language gives you the extra competitive edge in the business world.''</p>
        <p>At Eastport Elementary School, character development is taught from kindergarten through sixth grade.</p>
        <p>''The course is important,'' said Priscilla Tuttle, who heads the character education committee at the school, ''because it demonstrates to children that they can become better people by accentuating their positive qualities. It gives them a reason to believe in themselves and develops traits they'll need in later life when their employers want a responsible, respectful person working for them.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tuttle, who teaches chemistry at Suffolk County Community College, and is the mother of three children under the age of 12, said the course content was based on a survey of parents who rated 15 character traits in order of importance. Nine were chosen, one for each month of the school year.</p>
        <p>In conveying the values of responsibility, cooperation, kindness, acceptance, honesty, heroism, fairness, perseverance, and building self-esteem, the teachers employ a variety of methods. If, for instance, a child catches a classmate being kind, the name of the virtuous child is written on a paper leaf that is hung on the school's Kindness Tree.</p>
        <p>The children tote garbage bags through the streets of Eastport to assist the town's spring cleanup, donate toys and games to the Salvation Army to distribute to needy families and invite the school's auxiliary staff of secretaries and custodians, whose photographs and names are featured on a bulletin board, to speak to them about their jobs.</p>
        <p>Zachary Skarka, 7, said that when honesty was the character trait of the month, he learned that ''honesty is important because you and someone else can get hurt. You can lose friends.</p>
        <p>''Always tell the truth,'' he added, ''or people won't like you. Lies can get bigger and bigger.''</p>
        <p>Thomas Lickona is a professor of education at SUNY-Cortland and author of ''Educating for Character: How Our Schools Can Teach Respect and Responsibility.''</p>
        <p>''Education,'' he said, ''has two great goals: to become smart and to become good. Character education used to be an integral part of school learning, but it got less popular with the rise of positivism in the 1940's -- facts are empirical; values are subjective; the personalism of the '60's, that shed new light on personal dignity but also neglected personal responsibility; the pluralism of the '70's that made people ask, 'Whose values should you teach?' and the secularization of the public arena in the '80's and '90's that banned prayer in schools.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lickona said that courses like the one taught in Eastport ''are a return to a much older form of character education, where honesty, compassion, fairness, self-control, respect and responsibility are recognized as objectively good qualities that transcend time and culture and help the individual and society stem the slide down the ethical tubes.''</p>
        <p>Such courses may soon be appearing all over the state. The Safe Schools Against Violence in Education Act, which became law in July, mandates that by next July, all public schools in New York must establish ''safer and more effective learning environments'' through a variety of measures, including comprehensive violence-prevention education programs, granting teachers and principals increased authority to discipline students, and ''instruction in civility, citizenship, tolerance, and character education.''</p>
        <p>''When students are taught the principles of honesty, tolerance, personal responsibility and respect for others, and when they learn courtesy and how to obey rules and laws, all our schools -- students and teachers alike -- will be safer,'' said Kenneth P. LaValle, a state senator from Port Jefferson and a cosponsor of the measure.</p>
        <p>The trend to have schools teach character is not universally embraced. Lainie Marin of East Rockaway said that her daughter Lindsay, 11, a seventh-grader at the Lynbrook Middle School, ''can learn the laws of society in school, but when it comes to morals and ethics and knowing right from wrong, that's where the nurture part of parenting comes in. Those are the prerogatives of parents.''</p>
        <p>''Besides,'' she added, ''people have different definitions of character, so how can a parent be sure that a teacher shares the same values as her student's family?''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lickona said that it's not only students who benefit from unconventional programs and courses, but educators as well.</p>
        <p>''Teachers want to make a difference in the lives of their students,'' he said, ''not just teach fractions.''</p>
