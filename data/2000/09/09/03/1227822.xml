        <p>They were coming off an injury-riddled 4-7 season and a year in which their defense was more porous than all but seven Division I-A teams. Just 75 seconds into a new season, the hard-luck U.C.L.A. Bruins lost their starting quarterback and allowed a 71-yard punt return by Freddie Milons.</p>
        <p>Alabama's vaunted offense was still waiting to be unleashed.</p>
        <p>But after a surprisingly dominant 35-24 victory over the third-ranked Crimson Tide, the shift in the perception of the U.C.L.A. program promised to be tectonic.</p>
        <p>The unranked Bruins will shake up the rankings as surely as they took apart Alabama before 76,640 at the Rose Bowl. They posted the first important upset of the season, and, with No. 6 Michigan coming here Sept. 16, U.C.L.A. has a chance to make as big a dent in the polls as they did to the Crimson Tide's reputation.</p>
        <p>''This has to go down as one of our all-time great wins,'' U.C.L.A. Coach Bob Toledo said. ''I don't know if we're back, but I'm excited for the Bruins and the Pac-10.''</p>
        <p>The unranked Bruins found an identity in their ground game and won respect for their defense. DeShaun Foster rushed for 187 yards and 3 touchdowns on 42 carries. The Bruins forced three key turnovers and held Alabama to 265 total yards.</p>
        <p>U.C.L.A.'s certain jump into the top 25 came behind the backup quarterback Ryan McCann, who replaced the injured starter, Cory Paus, and completed 14 of 24 passes for 194 yards with a touchdown and an interception. On the game's first play, Paus separated his  passing shoulder. He was expected to be out up to four weeks.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 7-0 and with McCann at the helm, the Bruins put together a 19-play, 64-yard touchdown drive that was equal parts desperation and drama. Three times they faced fourth-and-short, and each time they converted.</p>
        <p>''I'm not quite a riverboat gambler, but what I did decide was that they would score some points on us,'' Toledo said. ''And when they scored 7  right off the bat, I thought it might be about 200. We had to do something like that early.''</p>
        <p>Alabama mounted several comeback attempts but could not shake the Bruins through three quarters. The Crimson Tide, which trailed by 21-17 at halftime, grabbed the lead midway through the third quarter when free safety Reggie Myles stunned the Bruins with a 91-yard interception return of McCann's only glaring mistake.</p>
        <p>But McCann redeemed himself on U.C.L.A.'s next possession, firing a 46-yard score to Freddie Mitchell. The Bruins followed that with an 8-yard run by Foster and took a 35-24 lead into the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Behind Foster's 42 carries, which tied a school record, U.C.L.A. built a huge edge in time of possession, keeping the ball for 37 minutes 19 seconds to Alabama's 22:41.</p>
        <p>''I told my offensive staff, if we don't run him 30 times, I'll be very upset,'' Toledo said of Foster. ''We want to be a balanced offensive team. We wanted to shorten the game and keep the ball out of their hands.''</p>
        <p>Alabama Coach Mike DuBose said: ''That was a great game plan against us. I'm disappointed in the way we played and the way I prepared them.''</p>
