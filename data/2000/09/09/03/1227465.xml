        <p>Melissa Basho (left): ''That picture's got a serious look, which represents me and Sarah, personality-wise -- though I wouldn't like to consider myself a smoker; it's just something to keep me occupied. Some girls waste their energy on high school gossip, ridiculous stuff that's never true. I'll be graduating next year, and I'm ready to just close the chapter. This summer I learned a lot about who my real friends are. This is my last year of high school; why bother with everybody else?''</p>

        <p>Sarah Stevens (right): ''That was just like a catching-up moment -- sitting in the car and talking. I graduated last year, and I have maybe four good friends left at home, Melissa included. For me, this summer was about figuring out who to stay in touch with, who was worth it, and Melissa was definitely one of them. At first it was really sad when I came back and couldn't get along with some people. I've just gotten used to the fact that that's just the way it is. You lose friends. It's sad, but it happens.''</p>
