        <p>THE chronic problem of the nation's high-technology labor force? Simple: There isn't enough of it.</p>
        <p>The shortage of technology workers explains one of Washington's annual rituals. Silicon Valley executives warn Congress that unless private industry is allowed to hire more skilled foreign workers, growth in the new economy will sputter for lack of able minds. Organized labor complains, but to little effect. The industry typically prevails, reasonably, because the problem is a real one -- and the visa quotas for skilled immigrants are raised once more.</p>
        <p>Nothing is more American than immigration. Yet the persistent shortage of home-grown technology workers to fill these high-skill, high-wage jobs does suggest that something is amiss in the labor market. Why isn't the supply of graduates from the nation's universities adjusting faster to  meet the demand? What policy steps can help solve the problem?</p>
        <p>Those questions are the focus of a recent paper by Paul M. Romer, an economist at the Stanford Business School, prepared for the National Bureau of Economic Research. Mr. Romer is a pioneering thinker behind a set of ideas called new growth theory.</p>
        <p>Put simply, new growth theory emphasizes the economic role of innovation. And innovation, according to Mr. Romer, is the X-factor in an economy, the elixir of sustained growth. So the goal of policy, he says, should be to foster innovation.</p>
        <p>The right kinds of institutions are essential, he wrote in his paper, but ''unfortunately, in the last 20 years, innovation policy in the United States has almost entirely ignored the structure of our institutions of higher learning.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, he explained that any policy analysis has to ''get deeply into the details of how those institutions work.''</p>
        <p>In the university system, he sees a marketplace sorely in need of new and different incentives if it is ever to help erase the shortage of skilled workers in technology fields. He said he believes that there is a role for government to play in overhauling those incentives.</p>
        <p>Too often, according to Mr. Romer, government programs intended to encourage scientific research have simply handed money or tax breaks to universities and companies -- which mainly increases the demand for scientists and engineers without doing anything for the supply.</p>
        <p>''The crucial input,'' he said, ''is to have more well-trained people who are engaged in innovative activities.''</p>
        <p>He would spend the money differently. At the undergraduate level, he recommends paying schools a bounty for increasing the number of graduates who receive science or engineering degrees -- $10,000 a head. This would reward liberal-arts schools, whose student populations tend to run heavy with English, history and social science majors, with an incentive to expand science and engineering programs.</p>
        <p>At the graduate level, Mr. Romer sees different dimensions of the problem and suggests a different kind of supply-side subsidy. Increasingly, he said, research grants go to  star professors, who then support graduate students as their research assistants. This system, he says, delivers some real benefits in basic research, but it nurtures an academic research culture instead of one that responds well to the needs of commerce.</p>
        <p>THE Romer solution is to liberate graduate science and engineering students from dependence on money trickling down from professors; instead, he would have the government underwrite three-year fellowships with $20,000 annual stipends for nearly 17,000 students a year to pursue advanced degrees.</p>
        <p>The two programs would combine to subsidize the right thing -- turning out more qualified people -- while giving more power to individuals and innovative institutions to decide how resources are used, Mr. Romer argues, adding that this approach sidesteps political problems. ''It avoids the issues of pork-barrel science, giving money to politically favored constituents, and it also avoids the pitfall of having the government try to pick technology winners and losers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The price tag? For 100,000 additional undergraduate degrees, $1 billion a year, and another $1 billion for the graduate fellowships.</p>
        <p>Justifying the spending, he said, would be the ''social return'' -- improved prospects for higher growth over the next 20 to 50 years, as more people engage in innovative activity.</p>
        <p>In his paper, Mr. Romer cited a comparable policy that proved a winner: creation of a new academic discipline, computer science, in the 1960's. ''Even now,'' he wrote, ''with the passage of 40 years, our sense of the magnitude of the payoff from this investment is still growing.''</p>
