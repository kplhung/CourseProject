        <p>Readers would be forgiven for assuming the title ''The Lost Legends of New Jersey'' announces an all-too-familiar exercise in Jersey Irony. But the author, Frederick Reiken, a native of the state, intends no irony. The setting is indeed New Jersey, and the novel focuses on the Rubin family, living in Livingston in the late 1970's and early 80's and their tangled relationships among themselves and with other families. Central are two teenagers, Anthony Rubin and his moody next-door neighbor, Juliette Dimiglio. The novel starts as the families share a house at the Jersey Shore in 1979 against a background of a tide of syringes that closes the beach. But that is historical realism, after all. Still Gary Krist, reviewing the novel in The Times, says that Mr. Reiken ''captures the poetry of the New Jersey condition.'' Poetry and New Jersey, in the same sentence, without irony. Imagine that. ''Lost Legends of New Jersey (Harcourt) is $24 in hardback.</p>
