        <p>Thomas Powers letter reponds to Erik Tarloff's July 16 review of his novel, The Confirmation (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Erik Tarloff, reviewing my novel ''The Confirmation'' (July 16), has some nice things to say about me personally, and some harsh things to say about my book. But I was startled by his remark that my book ''has no apparent aspirations to be anything other than a satisfying entertainment.'' I thought my aspirations would be unmistakable -- to show how difficult it can be to understand what is really going on in the world of intelligence organizations; to know for sure who are the heroes and who the villains; and above all to reach firm moral judgments. The various strands of the story get resolved clearly enough, but the moral questions are all left conspicuously open. That's what I hoped would nudge and unsettle the reader. But I did hope the book would be entertaining, too, I admit it. Tarloff has me there.</p>
