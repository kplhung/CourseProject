        <p>I enjoyed reading your article about the giant sequoia trees (''A Tree Grows Where?'', Aug. 6).</p>
        <p>My family and I are fortunate to have a spectacular example growing in our front yard in Weston. It was planted about 40 years ago and is a good deal taller than our three-story house. This past spring, I found dozens of seedlings sprouting in the window boxes, so I dug some up and put them in pots. I'm thinking of turning a cluster of them into a bonsai study.</p>

        <p>Imagine what that would look like in 40 years! What puzzled us about your story is why you had such unattractive photos of this amazingly beautiful tree. You should have featured one on the front page with the tree bearing needles. Anyway, thanks for the story even though the pictures were disappointing.</p>
