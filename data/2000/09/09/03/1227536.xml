        <p>Gold medals are showered so profusely in so many wine competitions that they equal in value the German marks trundled to banks in wheelbarrows during the Weimar Republic.</p>
        <p>Besides, who knows how qualified the judges were and what standards and practices were used.</p>
        <p>Yet, certain wines are obvious winners. Take the charming Baron Herzog '99 chenin blanc, made in California by the Royal Wine Corporation in Brooklyn. (It's kosher, a fact relevant perhaps only to Orthodox Jews.)</p>
        <p>This starlet, from a Loire grape that bafflingly has fallen from favor in North America, and is priced to sell nationally at $6, defeated 732 whites to win the title of best white wine of the show at the Riverside International Wine Competition in California in May.</p>
        <p>Peter Stern, Royal's winemaker in California, has a sure hand with this grape: the '98 Baron Herzog chenin blanc was voted best white wine at the '99 West Coast Wine Competition in California.</p>
        <p>In Scarsdale, the ubiquitous Herzog chenin costs $6.50 at Cheers, 1070-72 Wilmot Road; in Mamaroneck, $8 at Mamaroneck Station Liquors, 137 Halstead Avenue; in Riverdale, the Bronx, $6 at Fieldston, 3704 Riverdale Avenue (236th Street), and $6 at Skyview, in a shopping center at 5681 Riverdale Avenue (259th Street).</p>
        <p>Light as chiffon, the chenin, fresh and quaffable, is as aromatic as a summer garden. It is round and dry enough to pour as an aperitif or to wash down fish, chicken and veal. When moderately chilled, at first sip it delivers a teasingly fruity opening punch line, which, as it warms up, yields to a quieter, more serious flavor narrative with a citric nip in the long finish.</p>
        <p>Talk about bargains!</p>
