        <p>IN the 1970's, Japan's automakers made a name for themselves in the United States with small cars that were reasonably priced, economical to own and fun to drive. Detroit sold small cars in those days -- Chevy Vega owners, please stand up -- but its heart wasn't really in it.</p>
        <p>But whenever Toyota, Nissan, Honda or even Mazda tried to beat the Big Three at their game -- building trucks or big family cars -- they usually fell flat. There aren't many fan clubs or newsletters for enthusiasts of the Toyota Cressida.</p>
        <p>Then, five years ago, Toyota brought out the Avalon, a made-in-America family sedan aimed right at the business that Buick, Chrysler and Oldsmobile had owned for years. Based on the ever-popular Camry, the Avalon was a smooth-riding, well-padded cruiser that was long on quality although a little short on flash. It looked like a fancier Camry, which itself had styling that was far from the cutting edge.</p>
        <p>Car buffs dismissed the Avalon as a Japanese Buick. But today, even Toyota executives use that description as shorthand for what the car is about: easy-riding, mid-  range luxury for buyers in their mid-50's, which is considerably younger than the average Buick customer.</p>
        <p>Buick, by the way, has also transcended its reputation. Last year, when I tested the redesigned LeSabre with an optional touring suspension, I was surprised by the car's relatively crisp handling and taut road manners. Taut? Crisp? These are not words one used to associate with Buicks.</p>
        <p>So how does the Avalon measure up against the LeSabre? Pretty well, actually.</p>
        <p>For the 2000 model, just about every visible element of the Avalon was changed. It is wider and taller to give it greater stature and more room inside. To add space, the dashboard was moved forward several inches and the rear seat was set back a tad. The result is a cabin built for stretching out.</p>
        <p>One of the most noticeable changes inside is a Buck Rogers dashboard with a large, back-lighted liquid-crystal display showing the date, time, compass reading and outside temperature. The display is eye-catching, with amber lettering on a cool blue-green background, but it is so large and distracting that it is hard to get used to.</p>
        <p>The interior redesign results in more headroom, and in significantly more legroom in the rear. Since the Avalon is now wider, and there is little dead space between the doors and the seats, it is not a stretch to call this a six-passenger car when it is equipped with a front bench seat. In no car, including this one, is the middle seating position comfortable for long, but the room is there to put three adults abreast in front and rear. There are three adjustable headrests in the back along with three shoulder belts.</p>
        <p>All this interior decorating has produced an exterior design that is, at first, jarring. The idea was to make the Avalon look a lot different from the Camry, and it does. But it also comes off looking a little dated in some ways, a little heavy and oafish in others. The body seems high and disjointed, as if it was designed by committee.</p>
        <p>The Avalon's flat sides hark back to the sheet-metal slabs that Mercedes has scrapped on its biggest cars. The fixed windows behind the rear doors serve as reminders of the opera-window craze of the 70's. And behind the sizable trunk, the tailights attempt to mimic Mercedes but miss badly with oddly positioned backup lights that detract from the otherwise simple design.</p>
        <p>But if prospective buyers find the Avalon's look ungainly, it is not keeping them out of showrooms. Although the car is at the high end of its price bracket, with a base price of $26,300 and fully dressed XLS sedans exceeding $34,000, sales are up a whopping 90 percent from 1999. Business is so good that Toyota has increased production at its plant in Georgetown, Ky., where the Camry is also made. Clearly, many shoppers think the Avalon is worth its $4,000 premium over a comparable Camry.</p>
        <p>On the road, the Avalon is quiet and competent, just what you'd expect from Toyota. Outside noise is pretty well muted, as are the bumps and ripples of the road. Braking is superbly confident, and while there was some minor hesitation in acceleration it was insignificant. The four-speed automatic transmission was virtually seamless.</p>
        <p>The Avalon executed corners well for a front-drive car of its bulk, and while it backed away a bit in some twists of the road -- leaning a little here and there -- it fared better than most sedans in its category.</p>
        <p>In a matchup with the LeSabre, I would give the Avalon a slight edge. The ride is smooth and the handling is impressive, with no hint of sloth. But a fully equipped LeSabre costs several thousand dollars less than a loaded Avalon, and Buick currently offers a $1,500 rebate, to boot.</p>
        <p>I was disappointed that the Avalon's 3-liter, 24-valve V-6 requires pricey 91-octane gasoline, particularly since the power plant is quite similar to the regular-gas engine of the Camry. The chief difference is that the Avalon V-6 has sophisticated variable valve timing, which raises the horsepower to 210 from 194. The good news is that the fuel-economy rating ranges from 21 m.p.g. in the city to 29 on the highway.</p>
        <p>The 2000-model test car came with some annoyances that were surprising, given its $34,033 window sticker. For one, while there were lots of thoughtful interior touches, like covered storage bins in the doors, reading lamps and power outlets, the power-window switches were not lighted at night. There were also inexcusable rattles, some from the pull-down compartments in the doors. Every time you closed the door or hit a bump the items inside jingle-jangled.</p>
        <p>There were also rattles in the front cup holders -- particularly surprising given that their lids, and the glovebox door, are dampened to glide open slowly and softly.</p>
