        <p>SEEING the widening Hudson River Valley through the rain and mists that have plagued our summer has not detracted from its loveliness. As Monet understood and depicted in his many paintings of Rouen's cathedral, every moment and every weather can bring a stirring new impression. And where better to take in this view than from the very edge of the river -- from the lawn or patio of North Gate here, or through the broad windows of its dining room?</p>
        <p>Given such a setting, any restaurant need only be adequate, and North Gate's kitchen has had a checkered past. But recent visits have found the food inventive and delightfully appealing, and the service to be charming and accommodating.</p>

        <p>SEEING the widening Hudson River Valley through the rain and mists that have plagued our summer has not detracted from its loveliness. As Monet understood and depicted in his many paintings of Rouen's cathedral, every moment and every weather can bring a stirring new impression. And where better to take in this view than from the very edge of the river -- from the lawn or patio of North Gate here, or through the broad windows of its dining room?</p>
        <p>Given such a setting, any restaurant need only be adequate, and North Gate's kitchen has had a checkered past. But recent visits have found the food inventive and delightfully appealing, and the service to be charming and accommodating.</p>
        <p>With the light, tasty vinaigrette evenly distributed, a fresh frisee salad came with all entrees. It could serve as a first course, but to miss some of the appetizers would be a pity, particularly one as delectable as warm potato ''lasagna,'' a brilliant layering of potato, goat cheese and wild mushrooms moistened with a reduction of port.</p>
        <p>An artistic arrangement of cold, slim asparagus, scoops of soft mozzarella and roasted sweet red pepper tasted as good as it looked, and a plentiful serving of mild, smoked fish -- salmon, trout, bluefish pate, whitefish salad -- arranged on a bed of field greens could have made a satisfying light entree. In fact, a couple of appetizers could easily have added up to a full dinner.</p>
        <p>Bathing in flavorful, garlic-sparked broth, which invited sopping, mussels were clean and fresh, as were succulent sea scallops in a frangible sesame crust -- a special. Savory red pepper aioli and a tidy mound of smoked salmon gave ubiquitous crab cakes an innovative spin, as did the side of coleslaw.</p>
        <p>So often dry and overcooked elsewhere, medallions of pork and breast of chicken miraculously retained all their tenderness and juiciness. Zesty mustard sauce came with the pork, and Madeira sauce added nuance to the chicken.</p>
        <p>Mouthwatering grilled shell steak, surely two inches thick, arrived slathered with fragrant herb and garlic butter.</p>
        <p>Only somewhat less successful were a couple of fish dishes, pristine cod and salmon, fine on their own but overwhelmed by the overly enthusiastic addition of vinegary marinated peppers and very salty capers, which needed an extra rinse or two.</p>
        <p>Mussels and clams over a too small tangle of linguine were also short on flavor. But accompanying vegetables received a great deal more attention than a half-hearted douse in boiling water.</p>
        <p>Whipped potatoes, wild mushrooms, wilted spinach, crunchy  string beans, squash and more proved delicious.</p>
        <p>North Gate is where one doesn't forget about desserts. Diners will not be sorry they ordered any of them: intensely fruity passion fruit or lemon sorbet, opulent pecan caramel fudge cake (to dream about) and superb bread pudding.</p>
        <p>Dinner -- including appetizer or soup, house salad, entree and dessert -- averages $33 without drinks, tax and tip.</p>
        <p>North Gate is at the river's edge, 100 yards north of the gazebo at the foot of Main Street.</p>
        <p>North Gate  1 North Street, Cold Spring.  (845) 265-5555.</p>
