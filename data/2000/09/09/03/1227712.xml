        <p>About noon the other day, Harry J. Bubbins pushed through a fence in front of Brook Park in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, plucked  mint from a garden bed and popped it into his mouth. ''Yerba buena,'' he said, delightedly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bubbins, an organizer with the Cherry Tree Association, a Mott Haven group that promotes gardening and the arts, walked through the  park, his cane carved out of a tree branch pressing into the moist earth, with a Zen-like grin.</p>
        <p>''It's not that often that you find an abandoned park in the South Bronx,'' he said, in front of a small garden plot. ''It was incumbent upon the community to do something with it.''</p>
        <p>He picked a long, slim radish out of the dirt and chomped on it. ''You can eat the whole thing,'' he said, pushing the light green tip into his mouth. ''Greens and all.''</p>
        <p>Until March, Brook Park was an abandoned plot of grass and concrete that thugs used to train pit bulls in the art of war. In February, about 80 neighborhood residents held a demonstration near the park, organized by Bronx Acorn, a local group, demanding that the Parks Department turn it around.</p>
        <p>But instead of waiting for city to respond, the Cherry Tree Association took the matter into its own hands. Mr. Bubbins and his associates organized a cleanup, turning the lot into a lush, green playground.</p>
        <p>Children from a local homeless shelter planted radishes. Bronx Green-Up, a group affiliated with the New York Botanical Garden, donated cherry trees. Neighborhood residents planted birches, spruce trees and a rare corkscrew weeping willow. A barbershop supplied buckets of water. And Martha Stewart's foundation donated flower bulbs, which were planted in an old bathtub.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bubbins loped toward another garden bed and bit through the light green exterior of a pea pod, then held it up to the the light. ''A pea,'' he declared, then downed it. The next vegetable in his path, a purple string bean, had no chance.</p>
        <p>Judith Lopez arrived with her daughter, Rebekah Rose, 5, and a friend, Maria Hernandez, 14. Ms. Lopez is a Mott Haven native and a community organizer with Casa Atabex Ache, a local women's group whose name, loosely translated, means House of Women's Power. A few months ago, the group learned of Cherry Tree's efforts to clean up Brook Park and came out to help.</p>
        <p>''When I was growing up here, we couldn't go outside, because it was the worst neighborhood for drugs,'' Ms. Lopez said. ''To know that my daughter can come out here and walk in a garden and see how things grow is just wonderful.''</p>
