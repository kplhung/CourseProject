        <p>WHEN Philip Como walks into Smithtown High School later this week, he plans to welcome his students by dumping a pile of (discarded) textbooks into a wastebasket.</p>
        <p>''That gets their attention really quick,'' the 32-year-old business teacher said. ''It sends the message that this class will be different -- no textbooks. Then I go to the wall and shut off the lights. I flick them back on and I say, ''Welcome to E-commerce.''</p>
        <p>E-commerce, offered this fall in place of last year's Business Ownership: Small Business Management, will emphasize Web site development. The course arose from suggestions made by the district's Industry Advisory Board to introduce Internet-based commerce into the high school curriculum.</p>
        <p>The new course is but one of dozens of curriculum tweaks arising from the increasing interaction of administrators, teachers and students with business people.</p>
        <p>Of Long Island's 126 school districts, 52 now have some kind of business advisory board. About three-quarters of those boards have been formed since January 1999, according to the Nassau-Suffolk School Board Association. Much of the push comes from an initiative called Long Island Works, a coalition of businesses and schools that was created by the Long Island Association, the region's chamber of commerce.</p>
        <p>Once suspicious of outside influences, schools these days are actively courting business involvement. Their efforts to integrate businesses into the classroom are usually applauded by parents who want their children to be prepared for the workplace when they graduate.</p>
        <p>Others are opposed. Charles M. Richardson, an educational consultant in South Huntington and an advocate of back-to-basics educational reform, criticized the growing influence of business advisory councils.</p>
        <p>''These councils aren't responsible to the district taxpayer,'' he said, ''and yet here they are replacing basic education in our schools -- the teaching of reading, writing and mathematics -- in favor of workplace skills on the entry level. It's really vocational training. That has been done in Europe and it has failed. And it's going to fail here, too.''</p>
        <p>Employers are the biggest boosters of the curriculum changes. ''Businesses are not finding the workers with the skills they're looking for, and they want to see students with more of the interpersonal and soft skills,'' said Cheryl Davidson, executive director of Long Island Works. She defined soft skills as including communication skills and analytical thinking.</p>
        <p>They're also looking for hard skills -- math, science, basic literacy and computer skills -- and are pressuring schools to teach them better. Often, through the councils, they offer specific suggestions about what should be taught, and sometimes how.</p>
        <p>While businesses have been courted by schools before, generally it was to sponsor short-term projects. Smithtown's board, in contrast, encourages business people to get involved in curriculum development, advise on infrastructure investment, and participate in direct education not only of students but of teachers as well, most of whom have never worked in the private sector.</p>
        <p>Teachers here and in other districts participate in internship programs where they spend part of a day at a business, seeing how it's run.</p>
        <p>''The old relationship between business and education was not based on reciprocity,'' said Michael Walsh, Smithtown's interim superintendent. ''Schools were looking for grants and businesses were looking for ways to control the curriculum. What I see is that there's been a maturing of the relationship. We both realize we can learn from each other.''</p>
        <p>Some of that learning has produced curriculum changes, such as the introduction of Mr. Como's e-commerce course. Other changes are reflected in donations of products and services from corporate benefactors. Several years ago, Bohemia-based Symbol Technologies introduced a wireless networking system into the high school; more recently it donated a shipment of Palm Pilots.</p>
        <p>Dozens of business owners, managers and professionals volunteer their time as classroom advisers. Mr. Como acknowledged that his textbook trashing reflects a change not only in style but in approach: Smithtown teachers are actively encouraged to ''market'' their courses by working harder to seize student attention.</p>
        <p>''Businesses on the board show us how you can put advertising and marketing techniques to good use in the classroom,'' said Susan Gubing, the district's school-industry coordinator.</p>
        <p>Robert Mattson is both a parent in the district and, through his advertising agency, Smithtown-based Sanna Mattson MacLeod, a member of the business board. Last year, he was invited to address Mr. Como's small-business class. The students were producing an advertisement, and Mr. Mattson spent his visit offering advice.</p>
        <p>''The students were able to show Bob what they had done, in terms of an ad, and he gave them feedback,'' Mr. Como said. ''Students saw they were learning real-world skills, not just things to pass a high school course.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mattson was impressed with the district's openness to suggestions from business members.</p>
        <p>''The district turned to us and asked how we thought curriculum should be changed,'' he recalled. ''My response was, 'We need to have keyboarding courses. Kids need to learn things like word processing, database management and data entry. And the earlier the grade, the better.' ''</p>
        <p>In Comsewogue, the school district's business administrator, Carl Fraser, invited Ray Annicelli, who owns Shaefer Exterminating, to address the kindergarten class. After consulting the classroom teacher, Mr. Annicelli arrived in the classroom equipped with a board displaying insect models he had collected -- and a strategy for grabbing the little ones' attention.</p>
        <p>''Hey, one bug is missing!'' he exclaimed. ''Where is it?'' The hunt for the missing bug produced what marketing executives might call consumer commitment. Finally, one of the children spotted the missing rubber bug. It was stuck on his back.</p>
        <p>''I kept saying, 'Where is it, where is it?' '' Mr. Annicelli related. ''They were calling out, and finally they just mobbed me to show me the bug.</p>
        <p>''I guess it went over big, because they invited me back,'' Mr. Annicelli surmised. ''The next time, they had 10 classes waiting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fraser, whose own resume includes stints at CBS Records and Citibank, said that involving local business owners conveys the message that schools want to teach for the real world.</p>
        <p>''No question about it,'' he said, ''businesses and schools have different cultures. There can be conflict when business people come in with new ideas and suggestions.</p>
        <p>''But it's absolutely necessary,'' he concluded. ''Schools have traditionally lagged behind in employing technology and teaching students the kind of skills businesses require. As a business administrator myself, having worked in entertainment and banking, I understand why businesses complain. So I am on a crusade to help businesses and schools connect.''</p>
