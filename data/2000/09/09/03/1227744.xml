        <p>Once Apple Computer's multicolored iMacs and sleek G4 Cubes had injected hip fashion sense into computer hardware and peripherals, it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a way to give the stuff the decadent gleam of conspicuous consumption.</p>
        <p>The Wallace Silversmiths unit of Syratech, best known for its flatware, has introduced computer mice plated in precious metals.</p>
        <p>The silver mice went on sale last Friday at Bloomingdale's after weeks of advertising; other upscale department store chains like Neiman-Marcus and Saks and a few jewelers will also carry them. In ordinary silverplate, they sell for about $25; a sterling silver version due later this month will probably fetch about $200. And yes, there will be an 18-karat gold one, too, a bargain at just $2,000 -- more than you'd pay for most desktop computers, including those swanky Apple models.</p>
        <p>The mice can be engraved, a feature that helped make them a hit in the executive gift trade when Wallace started marketing them in April.</p>
        <p>And they actually work, of course -- though at 6.5 ounces they are a bit heavier in the hand than the standard plastic model. Wallace says the silver plating will withstand hundreds of thousands of mouse clicks, though like anything silver that is handled, it will develop a patina of tiny scratches after a while and will need regular polishing. So far, only two-button PC-type mice are available, though Macintosh-compatible one-button versions are planned.</p>
        <p>Apparently, though, no one thinks the digerati will be buying these things for themselves. As of Friday, the silver mice were nowhere to be found on the Web sites of Bloomingdale's, Neiman-Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue -- or even Wallace, the manufacturer.</p>
