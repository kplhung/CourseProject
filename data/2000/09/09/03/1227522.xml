        <p>WHEN Marc Jerome walks down the street from his office at Monroe College's campus here he passes vacant buildings, reminders of the decline of what was once a favorite destination for Westchester residents.</p>
        <p>But as chairman of the city's recently formed Business Improvement District, an organization of about 350 property owners, he sees opportunity on these blocks. The district, which covers almost all of downtown, is part of a larger effort to revitalize New Rochelle's center.</p>
        <p>''This was the downtown of Westchester,'' Mr. Jerome said, recalling thriving movie theaters, department stores and other attractions. ''If you talked to anyone in the 50's, New Rochelle was the place people went to. People have been pining for the old days.''</p>
        <p>With an annual budget of $300,000 coming from downtown property owners, the Business Improvement District, or BID, which was approved last September, has scheduled a series of Saturday events for families and has hired an off-duty police officer to provide extra security. It will also employ a 20-member maintenance crew to spruce up the streets. The BID is the county's third, after White Plains and Peekskill, and Yonkers has two in the works.</p>
        <p>By many accounts, however, the BID's most important effort is an ad campaign telling the public that downtown is on the way back.</p>
        <p>''Over the years people just started to think of downtown as a kind of void,'' Ralph DiBart, the BID's executive director, said. ''We're trying to put a face back on it.'' To do that Mr. DiBart said the BID would advertise in newspapers and on cable television.</p>
        <p>Filling vacant space is also a priority, he observed, saying the ''missing teeth syndrome,'' where parts of larger buildings are vacant, has had a negative psychological effect on the city.</p>
        <p>Many business owners say New Rochelle's decline was a slow process. When Bloomingdale's closed on Main Street in the early 70's, it signaled the beginning of the decline. After that things got worse until Macy's, the New Rochelle Mall's anchor, filed for bankruptcy protection in 1992. The mall closed shortly after that.</p>
        <p>''That was the death knell of downtown,'' said Mr. Jerome, who was brought in by Monroe College to revive its New Rochelle campus. Downtown's deterioration ''was a long time in coming,'' he added, and the college considered moving in 1992.</p>
        <p>The city's rebirth began in 1996 when Costco Wholesale and Home Depot opened stores on the city's South Side, although downtown did not benefit that much.</p>
        <p>Then, last September, New Roc City, a $190 million complex with skating rinks and an arcade, movie theaters, stores and a hotel, opened on the former site of the New Rochelle Mall. This was followed by the groundbreaking for a 412-unit apartment building in the heart of downtown.</p>
        <p>''The new residences will bring a new vitality to the town,'' said Robert Paley, the senior development director for AvalonBay Communities, the developer of the site. It is based in Alexandria, Va.</p>
        <p>''I think there's a lot of enthusiasm here for New Rochelle, so that carries over to the BID,'' he said. ''The city was showing a real commitment to downtown revitalization.''</p>
        <p>The apartment building will be ready for tenants next spring.</p>
        <p>Although it was nearly empty on a recent weekday, business owners and BID officials say New Roc City has brought people here from all over Westchester.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly bringing more people to the area, especially on the weekend,'' said Gregory Choron, the owner of the Merry-Go-Round toy store on Main Street. ''We have customers coming from Rye, Bronxville, Pelham and Larchmont, and they always comment there's been an incredible change.''</p>
        <p>Albert Tarentino, a co-owner of Talner Jewelry Store and president of the city's Chamber of Commerce, said he remembered times in his youth when the downtown was so crowded ''there was no room to walk.''</p>
        <p>He is already seeing a turn for the better, although he said it was too early to judge the BID's impact. ''There's more people, new faces,'' he said. ''If you came here five years ago and left and came back you wouldn't recognize it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tarentino also owns several properties in the BID and said that rents were on the rise.</p>
        <p>Some store owners, however, would like to see more upscale stores on Main Street. Jim Stillman, who has owned Liebman's clothing store with his wife, Marlene, since 1961, said, ''The only thing I am personally looking for is more attractive stores.'' He mentioned that chains like the Gap, Starbucks and Borders would help the downtown but also admitted that ''the neighborhood is on its way up.''</p>
        <p>Louis Vaccaro, the manager of the Curtain Shop, agreed.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of 99-cent stores, a lot of vacancies and certainly a lot less retail around,'' he said, adding that many reacted with skepticism when first approached with the idea of a BID. ''They had to sell it,'' he said. ''I'm willing to give it a chance. Hopefully, this year we'll see what they're capable of.''</p>
        <p>Organizers of the BID had some difficulty getting a majority of downtown property owners on board, and many felt that they were paying to duplicate services the city should provide, like street cleaning and security. In the end, only 17 downtown landlords voted against the district. Most stores will be paying about $600 a year to support the group.</p>
        <p>''The merchants recognize that even with the city doing what it could, it was still going to take their doing more,'' said Michael Ritchie, the city's acting commissioner of development. He added that the city supported the BID and has several representatives on its 13-member board. Tenants and residents are also represented.</p>
        <p>Beginning next Saturday with a soccer clinic, there will be six Saturday events sponsored by the BID, including a Harry Potter Day, a petting zoo and a Halloween Parade, which members hope will draw large crowds. A 5K road race will take place on Oct. 29 and a large arts and crafts fair has been scheduled for Labor Day weekend of next year.</p>
