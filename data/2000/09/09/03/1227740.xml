        <p>Letter from Dr Jeremy R Mack says, contrary to Aug 31 letter, there is nothing in recent study about stepmothers that would justify inference that they are bad or that families are worse off for their inclusion</p>

        <p>There is nothing in the recent study about stepmothers that would justify the inference that they are bad or that families are worse off for their inclusion (letter, Aug. 31).</p>
        <p>What is demonstrated is that stepmothers contribute nothing to the family equation. While this may be a correct inference in the context of the study, we are not obligated to discard as false our everyday impression that stepmothers are helpful.</p>

        <p>I have seen divorced-family situations in which the stepmother has been important in providing order and a perspective that lowered high levels of anxiety and chaos resulting from family separation. Those are truths, too.</p>
