        <p>Mount Hope Farm, a Colonial house in Bristol, R.I., has been chosen as the site for the Newport Showhouse Guild's Showhouse 2000. It will be open to the public from Saturday through Oct. 9.</p>
        <p>Built by Isaac Royal in 1745 and added to in 1840 and 1890, the four-bedroom, two-story Colonial house is on the National Register of Historic Places. William Bradford, the Rhode Island governor and later a United States senator, bought the property in 1783 and played host to George Washington there. In 1917, R. F. Haffenreffer took over, and the house remained in the Haffenreffer family until 1999 when the Mount Hope Trust acquired it. The estate, on the banks of Mount Hope Bay, comprises 127 tree-filled acres; it also has a barn, a playhouse, a 10-room guest cottage and a pool house.</p>

        <p>Mount Hope Farm, a Colonial house in Bristol, R.I., has been chosen as the site for the Newport Showhouse Guild's Showhouse 2000. It will be open to the public from Saturday through Oct. 9.</p>

William Bradford, the Rhode Island governor and later a United States senator, bought the property in 1783 and played host to George Washington there. In 1917, R. F.

The estate, on the banks of Mount Hope Bay, comprises 127 tree-filled acres; it also has a barn, a playhouse, a 10-room guest cottage and a pool house.</p>
        <p>Eight landscape designers and gardeners and 26 interior designers -- many from Rhode Island and some from as far away as England -- have signed on for the transformation. Among the highlights will be the kitchen and breakfast room designed by Joan Peters of Osterville Inc. in Osterville, Mass., and the library by Ron Alose, a Newport interior designer. Albert Lynch and William Hullsman of William Hullsman Designs in Beverly, Mass., will recreate the pool house with a snappy 1940's cocktail flavor.</p>
        <p>The house will be open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. On Wednesdays, designers will be present from noon to 8 p.m. Tickets are $20. A luncheon followed by a lecture and slide presentation by Chris Casson Madden, a writer about design and a television personality, is scheduled for Sept. 16. Lecture and lunch, $50, lecture only, $35.</p>
        <p>A special Bristol Day Ticket, which includes admission to the house as well as to the nearby Blithewold Mansion, Gardens and Arboretum and to Linden Place, an 1810 Federal mansion, is also available. Bristol Day tickets are $30.</p>
