        <p>A blaze on the Wildwood boardwalk -- an area that has seen a disproportionate number of unexplained fires -- raged for about 12 hours last week, destroying four novelty stores and causing an estimated $1 million damage.</p>
        <p>In the past 10 years, nearly a dozen fires have erupted on the boardwalk, where the shops have historically  been connected in a contiguous row of ''tinderboxes,'' Walter Larcombe of the Wildwood Fire Department said after last Tuesday's blaze.

        <p>A blaze on the Wildwood boardwalk -- an area that has seen a disproportionate number of unexplained fires -- raged for about 12 hours last week, destroying four novelty stores and causing an estimated $1 million damage.</p>
        <p>In the past 10 years, nearly a dozen fires have erupted on the boardwalk, where the shops have historically  been connected in a contiguous row of ''tinderboxes,'' Walter Larcombe of the Wildwood Fire Department said after last Tuesday's blaze. This fire claimed the last of the old-style  wooden construction, Mr. Larcombe said. ''The newer buildings all have a steel wall between them that prevents the fire from getting up into the roof and jumping from shop to shop,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>As for the question of arson, he said: ''In my early career here there was a lot of arson along the boardwalk. In the past few years there have been some that were questionable but never proven to be arson and a few that definitely were intentionally set.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Larcombe said the four shops were owned by Neil Hanui of Coral Gables, Fla. He said the four shops were leased to separate people, whose names were not available.</p>
        <p>In addition to destroying the four shops, several nearby businesses were forced to close. In all, damages were estimated at $1 million.</p>
        <p>Officials said the fire, reported at 1:45 a.m. on the 4300 block of the Boardwalk off Baker Avenue, started in a ground-floor storage room and was fed by cardboard boxes filled with T-shirts and novelty items. It quickly spread to the four  businesses.</p>
        <p>The adjacent Boardwalk Chapel suffered water and smoke damage. Two dozen teenagers were inside the chapel when the fire erupted, but all escaped without injury. The fire did not interrupt work at the nearby construction site of the $70 million convention hall.</p>
        <p>''Everyone is out there sifting through the debris and pulling down the remaining wall so that it doesn't come down on the investigators,' Mr. Larcombe said late last week. ''Looks like another possible arson. We'll wait and see.''</p>
