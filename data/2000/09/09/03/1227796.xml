        <p>Signs in Vermont are usually sweet: ''Maple Syrup,'' ''Farm Fresh Eggs,'' ''Country Crafts.'' But travelers over the state's winding roads at this summer's end are likelier to encounter signs proclaiming anger, backlash made visible: plain square black-on-white placards, thousands of them, on barns and garages and front porches, declaring ''Take Back Vermont.''</p>
        <p>Stop and inquire at houses displaying the signs in this poor farming and logging region of central Vermont, and the translation becomes clear: We are furious at our legislators for passing a law this spring letting gay couples be joined in marriagelike civil unions. We are mad about property tax reform, and all the permits we need to log or build on our land, and all the other laws our politicians pass against our will. We want to vote them out in November.</p>
        <p>''Civil unions are like the straw that broke the camel's back,'' said Ken Paronto, a retired machine shop owner here who has dangled a Take Back Vermont sign from a tree above the road to his house and plastered Take Back Vermont stickers on all four of his vehicles.</p>
        <p>Most of those who post the signs agree that the fight over civil unions has brought to a head the tension long rumbling between two kinds of Vermonters: an old ''woodchuck'' type, usually a native, often Republican and conservative; and a newer sort, usually a ''flatlander'' from out of state, often Democratic and liberal.</p>
        <p>But at the moment, the cause of the anger is the civil unions law, and from editorial pages to country roads, this campaign-season fight is getting nasty -- particularly in Orange and Washington counties, where the signs are most widespread.</p>
        <p>In the towns of Corinth and Topsham, there is even a low-level guerrilla war under way: residents say their signs have been stolen, defaced with pink triangles or other graffiti, or, in at least one case, burned. Antigay graffiti has been painted on some roads; so have the pink triangles, symbols of gay pride.</p>
        <p>Don't the vandals see, warned one resident on the Take Back Vermont side, Elisa Howes, ''that they could be at the wrong house at the wrong time stealing the wrong sign and end up getting shot?''</p>
        <p>The tension has grown to the point that 168 residents recently signed a  letter, printed in the local paper, decrying ''the divisiveness, hostility and mistrust we see overtaking our towns since the passage of the civil unions law.'' They described ''a climate of fear being created by people whose alarmist tactics discourage rational debate'' and called for a return to ''a spirit of community.''</p>
        <p>The trouble is not merely the signs, said Linda Weiss, a mail carrier, justice of the peace, planning board chairwoman and school board member who helped write the letter. It is the sense that since the civil unions law, antigay sentiment in this town of about 1,240 people is rising.</p>
        <p>''People are so angry,'' said Ms. Weiss, a former New Yorker who has lived here with her partner, Joyce McKeeman, for the last 10 years. ''They're filled with hostility and rage. It's scary to be in a small room with them, or in a small town with them, frankly.'' In particular, she said, she is concerned that local antigay propaganda harps on claims that gay men and lesbians are out to convert children and spread homosexuality. ''So suddenly it's not about Linda and Joyce, the lesbians they know,'' Ms. Weiss said. ''It's about 'the homosexual agenda.' ''</p>
        <p>For years, Ms. McKeeman said, she and Ms. Weiss had told friends what a live-and-let-live state Vermont was, where they could be who they were without worrying. ''And that's gone, that feeling is gone,'' she said. She wakes up at night fearing that someone could hate them enough to come and attack them.</p>
        <p>Talk to any of the people who display the signs, and they deny vehemently there is any hatred in the slogan. They tend to sound like Dick Lambert, the dairy farmer from Washington, Vt., who came up with the idea of printing the signs, and already has sold more than 4,000 of them, at $5 each, in a state of just 600,000 people.</p>
        <p>''We're tolerant but they've got to see,'' Mr. Lambert said. ''We don't go into their bedroom and tell them what to do, but don't shove it down our throats.''</p>
        <p>He was referring to the civil unions law but also to a hot topic among the Take Back Vermont camp: a $12,000 state grant that went to a program called Outright Vermont, which aims to train educators and students about tolerance and safety for gay and lesbian students. Many of the people who post the signs denounced the program as tantamount to teaching homosexuality to children.</p>
        <p>Carol Appleton, a mother of four and a dairy farmer who painted Take Back Vermont in giant letters across her roadside barn after a sign she had posted was stolen, recently decided to take her 7-year-old daughter out of school and teach her at home, she said, in part because of programs like Outright Vermont.</p>
        <p>In general, she said, she painted the sign because of ''the way the government takes more control.'' She said she wants ''to get politicians in there willing to listen to the people.'' And the sign ''is not meant to bash anybody,'' she said. ''It's more political.''</p>
        <p>The signs are, unquestionably, political. They tend to be paired with signs backing Ruth Dwyer, a Republican candidate for governor, who opposes civil unions. Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat, spoke out against them at a recent news conference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dean asked if residents really wanted to take Vermont back to the days of lax environmental rules, and to laws that made some towns pay much higher property tax rates to support their schools than others, and to ''a time when it was O.K. to discriminate against people for a variety of reasons.''</p>
        <p>''I personally don't think we do want to take back Vermont to those days,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What other Vermonters think will be clear on Sept. 12, when the state holds primaries that include challenges by several conservatives to legislators who supported the civil unions law, and in November.</p>
        <p>Asked if he could remember a time of such political tension in Vermont, Mr. Lambert said, happily, ''Not since Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys,'' the colonial-era rebels.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some here are already referring to a Take Back Vermont ''movement,'' though the signs seem to be spreading more through word of mouth than any organization.</p>
        <p>''It's just taken off like wildfire,'' Mr. Lambert said after taking a phone inquiry about the signs in his farmhouse kitchen.</p>
        <p>The preponderance of old-time Vermonters in the Take Back Vermont camp is not lost even on 13-year-old Tad Kingsbury, whose mother put up a sign on their roadside house to protest what she saw as the hypocrisy of local politicians who said they would oppose civil unions and then voted for them.</p>
        <p>''The people who really don't like civil unions are the ones who were born here and grew up here,'' Tad  said. ''The ones who like it are the ones who just moved here.''</p>
        <p>Some newspaper editorials have pointed out that the signs imply that the political process that led to the civil unions law was illegitimate. In fact, they say, the State Supreme Court was well within its rights to rule last December that gay couples were being discriminated against, and legislators were well within their rights to pass the law in response.</p>
        <p>But such editorials do not dissuade people with the signs, like Mr. Paronto, who said gays should be tolerated but not allowed to affect others: ''The good Lord made black and white, and it doesn't turn into gray. Like the signs.''</p>
