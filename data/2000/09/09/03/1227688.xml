        <p>WHEN Marisa Elena Cerveris and John Mark Savage met five years ago, she was a peripatetic ballerina living out of a tiny suitcase, while he occupied a book-filled room in a five-story communal house known as Aubergine, near Columbia University.</p>

Just to walk in evokes thoughts of potlucks and vegetarian diets.

        <p>WHEN Marisa Elena Cerveris and John Mark Savage met five years ago, she was a peripatetic ballerina living out of a tiny suitcase, while he occupied a book-filled room in a five-story communal house known as Aubergine, near Columbia University.</p>
        <p>Aubergine has for nearly 30 years sheltered about eight residents at a time, who share chores, meals (sometimes), refrigerator space, political views and common rooms, whose latest color incarnations include curry yellow and bordello red. It's a friendly place. One December, the Aubergines hung poster-size photographs of themselves around Manhattan with the message, ''Merry Christmas from our family to yours.'' Just to walk in evokes thoughts of potlucks and vegetarian diets. ''In the 70's, they had eggplant for dinner in some form almost every night,'' said Mary Daly, who lived in the house from 1977 until 1994. ''So they called it Aubergine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Savage, 35, who had a friend in the house, moved into a fourth-floor bedrooom in 1991. In a place full of artistic temperaments and hairdos to match, he stood out as someone pragmatic, serious and concerned about paying bills. For most of his years there, he studied for a Ph.D. in modern European history at New York University. He always had sharpened pencils, Post-its and time to talk about ways to strengthen the Aubergine community. ''John is the fatherly figure here,'' said Carol Tureski, a teacher and former Aubergine. ''He is the only responsible one.''</p>
        <p>In 1995, Ms. Daly introduced him to Ms. Cerveris, who was dancing with the Ballet du Capitole de Toulouse in France. ''She's a gypsy if there ever was one,'' Ms. Daly said. ''She could live out of such a small bag, you can't believe it. She loves meeting people. She loves the backstage life. She loves dressing rooms.'' Ms. Cerveris, 38, danced with the New York City Ballet from 1982 to 1991 and is now dancing in ''Phantom of the Opera'' on Broadway.</p>
        <p>She thought she wouldn't have much to say to Mr. Savage, whose favorite topics are basketball and democracy. ''I thought, 'Oh, he'll be way too smart for me,' '' she said. ''I'd done the dancer route, not going to college and all that.''</p>
        <p>But they started dating right away and were soon driving cross-country together, eating beef jerky and talking nonstop the whole way. ''Things became very wonderful very quickly,'' Ms. Cerveris said. In April 1997, she moved into Aubergine with her tiny bag of tiaras and other sparkly things. She started sewing curtains and lining the shelves with pretty paper. ''Marisa and John bring grace and thoughtfulness to the house,'' said Deirdre Clancy, a resident. ''They're exquisitely beautiful in pretty much every way.''</p>
        <p>Greg Muenzen, a sculptor in the house, added: ''They're adorable together. They're smoochy in the kitchen. John would always have a glass of wine for her at the end of the night after she danced.''</p>
        <p>Last spring, they announced their engagement, and everyone began preparing Aubergine for the wedding, painting walls, sanding floors, fixing the plumbing. Mr. Savage cooked all the food for the reception. The bride, who has started a business called By Marisa Dancewear, sewed her own stretch-satin dress.</p>
        <p>''Soup to nuts, the wedding probably cost $2,500,'' Ms. Daly said.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 26, they were married at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. Guests walked to Aubergine for the receiving line on the stoop and a garden party. The wedding was also a farewell for the couple, who are moving into a California beach cottage. This month, Mr. Savage will start work as a postdoctoral teaching fellow in the humanities program at the University of California at Irvine.</p>
        <p>By tradition, departing residents leave something behind at Aubergine: books, a couch, a hand-painted bowl. Mr. Savage and Ms. Cerveris are leaving Tupperware, a balanced budget and tips on how to walk like a ballerina. ''Hopefully, we're also leaving behind a love story,'' the bride said.</p>
