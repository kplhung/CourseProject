        <p>George W. Bush, at the annual convention of B'nai B'rith International in Washington on Monday.</p>
        <p>''Our nation is chosen by God and commissioned by history to be a model to the world of justice and inclusion and diversity without division. Jews and Christians and Muslims speak as one in the commitment to a kind, just, tolerant society.''</p>
        <p>Al Gore in an interview on Tuesday at a television station in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>''He [Lieberman] also believes, as I do, in separation of church and state. I believe in what he's saying. He's a man of great faith and I knew that when I selected him.''</p>
        <p>Joseph I. Lieberman at Fellowship Chapel, affiliated with the United Church of Christ, Detroit, on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''As a people, we need to reaffirm our faith and renew the dedication of our nation and ourselves to God and God's purposes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman in a Monday interview.</p>
        <p>''Religion in my opinion can be, and in my opinion usually is, a source of good behavior. But two things: I know religious people who I consider not to be moral, and I also know people who are not religious who I consider to be extremely moral. So . . . I'm talking here about probabilities.''</p>
        <p>Dick Cheney at the Fellowship of Christian Athletes national headquarters in Kansas City, Mo., on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>''We can recognize organizations like the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. It doesn't require anyone to buy into a particular set of religious beliefs or philosophical concerns. We have a lot of groups out there, Christian, Muslim, Jewish, that do good work in the community.''</p>
