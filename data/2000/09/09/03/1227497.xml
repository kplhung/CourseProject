        <p>ALL of Lee Child's bad guys in his four suspense novels are named for and modeled after the bosses who fired him in 1995 from his 20-year job in British commercial television.  He calls his work his lifelong revenge project.</p>
        <p>Now a successful, award-winning writer of novels of intrigue and adventure, including ''Running Blind'' released in July, Mr. Child immigrated to Pound Ridge from Kirkby Lonsdale in the Lake District in northwest England in 1998 with his daughter, Ruth, and his Westchester-born wife, Jane. He is published in 35 countries and in 27 languages.</p>
        <p>He is inspired by Westchester County. His in-laws' home and the hardware store in Millwood, The Westchester in White Plains and a grand estate in Pound Ridge appear in detail in his books.</p>
        <p>Lee Child is a pen name. Some of the most unscrupulous characters he creates are members of right-wing militias in Montana or the mob in New York, and he prefers to remain mysterious -- not unlike his intriguing hero, Jack Reacher, a loner and high-ranking ex-military police officer who appears in all four novels and who will also be in the next one, ''Echo Burning,'' scheduled to come out next year.</p>
        <p>In a distinctly British accent, Mr. Child talked about his very American hero in a recent interview in the Hiram Halle Library here.</p>
        <p>Q. What kind of a guy is Jack Reacher?</p>
        <p>A. I started out knowing what I didn't want him to be -- jaded, tired, or alcoholic.  He's upbeat and powerful, physically and mentally. But he's a drifter, uncomfortable and rather inarticulate in civilized society, a bit like me, really. I can go days without speaking, and it doesn't bother me at all -- echoes of the cowboy in the old-time westerns sort of thing. Reacher has a horror of getting burdened down even to the smallest thing. He avoids the dry cleaners because he would have to come back at a future date.  He's terrified of possessions and won't carry a bag when he jaunts from one end of the country to the other. He showers a lot but has only one set of clothes. On my Web site this is a big topic of concern but only with the women readers.</p>
        <p>Q. Your fan mail is two to one women to men. Your books are rather violent. Hands are chopped off; women are kidnapped in negligees and locked in corporate bathrooms high up in office buildings in Manhattan. In ''Running Blind'' Reacher says of a female suspect, ''Tell her first time she clams up, I'll break her arm, second time I'll grind her bones together.'' How do you account for your popularity with women with these testosterone-driven stories?</p>
        <p>A. I love the fabulous contrast between what a woman would see and what a man would see. I like women and want them to like my stuff. I think they're attracted to Reacher and would want to know him.  There's a bit of naivete about him.</p>
        <p>Q. You have an eye for minute detail. In ''Running Blind'' you describe an army base in New Jersey: ''The buildings were all brick with radiused corners and external stairways made of welded tubular steel painted green. Classic Army architecture of the 50's.'' How do you know these things?</p>
        <p>A. I'm trivia driven. Facts just pop up out of my head like a big, untidy basement. I've no patience for the research library, but I've read tens of thousands of books. Ever since I was a kid I've seen movies, and I'm pretty clear what an Army base looks like. Which leads me to an interesting point. It's not what something is really like, but rather what the reader thinks it's like. I admit to making up a lot. If you state something with aplomb, then people feel it's true.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you eavesdrop on people and store away conversations for later?</p>
        <p>A. All the time. I have a lifelong habit of listening and watching. Now it has a useful outlet. On book tours around the world I seek out the worst part of town and shadiest dives. I grew up in Birmingham in a tough neighborhood, and this is my natural habitat. I listen and blend in. I play pool in bars with truckers passing through.</p>
        <p>Q. What's next?</p>
        <p>A. It's a book-a-year sort of thing. Some magical days I blast through a huge amount of writing. Some days it's a bit of a slog. I'm not aiming to get studied in colleges in the next century or to win a Pulitzer Prize. I see myself as entertainment. A lot of people feel the suspense genre is like slumming. 'Don't you want to try another kind of book?' they ask me with a sniff. I'm a mass market kind of guy. Hopefully, all those kids who are reading Harry Potter will in a few years' time be reading Jack Reacher.</p>
