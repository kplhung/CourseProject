        <p>ROCKAWAY PARK  The Vikings Are Coming</p>

Among them will be the Viking Plym, which was hand-carved in 1912 and is the oldest Viking replica still sailing. The Skid bladner, the largest Viking replica, is also expected for the event, called Rockaway Viking Sail 2000 and coordinated by the Rockaway Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Popian, with his wife, Lucia, and their son John, artists from Romania, have contributed a movable sculpture that commemorates the return of the ships, using several  elements of Viking decoration.</p>
