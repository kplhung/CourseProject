        <p>THE first chapter of ''Joy Shtick,'' Joy Behar's rambling memoir, is called ''Trapped at Exit 60'' and describes, in often hilarious detail, the three years she spent in Centereach, ''totally isolated from civilization, but without the nice scenery.''</p>
        <p>Another section is devoted to ''Why I Hate the Beach.'' Ms. Behar, a comedian and a co-host of the ABC program ''The View,'' prefers ''cement,'' she wrote, because ''it doesn't get into your bathing suit, unless you owe money to the wrong people.''</p>
        <p>So what is Ms. Behar, who will headline the 16th International Jewish Arts Festival of Long Island tomorrow, doing back on the Island? True, it's the Hamptons where in March 1999 she became the proud owner of what she calls a ''modest'' (by star Hamptons standards) and ''north of the highway'' vacation house, with pool, tucked into the woods here. But it's still, Long Island and in a beach community, no less.</p>
        <p>''Exit 70 is not Exit 60,'' Ms. Behar said of the Long Island Expressway's gateway to the Hamptons. Not that she really has anything against people living off Exit 60, she hastened to add; despite writing that her neighbors ''did not smile much . . . because everyone seemed to have teeth missing. Apparently, dentistry stopped at Exit 59.''</p>
        <p>No, she said, her unhappiness during her sojourn in Centereach while her former husband studied for his Ph.D. at the State University at Stony Brook -- and she held down a series of jobs, including teaching English at Lindenhurst High School -- was actually her own doing.</p>
        <p>She was a ''city girl,'' born and reared in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, ''just two subway stops away from Manhattan'' and the theaters, operas and museums adored by her large Italian family. ''We were working class,'' she said, ''but had middle-class taste.''</p>
        <p>''Raised on the stoop, with hundreds of people all around me,'' she recalled, she found ''Exit 60 too far away from everybody. I was a fish out of water. Lonely.''</p>
        <p>Her ''circuitous route to Sagaponack,'' she said, really began in 1983 when, living in Forest Hills with her young daughter, she was fired from her job as an assistant to a producer on the ABC program ''Good Morning America.'' A would-be-comic ''since the age of 2,'' she heeded her therapist's advice that ''without a straight job all obstacles disappear,'' and went after a performing career ''full blast.''</p>
        <p>At first, ''afraid to go above 14th Street,'' she played small clubs in Greenwich Village. ''The gay audience is the best audience,'' she said. Eventually, she made it to ''Catch a Rising Star'' and her career, with comedy routines based mostly on her family, the current political scene, women's issues and the social differences between men and women, ''immediately started to cook.'' Just a year later she was back on ''Good Morning America'' as a guest star.</p>
        <p>By 1996 Ms. Behar was an established comedian, playing all the major venues; she also had a talk show on WABC-Radio. One evening, when appearing at an 89th birthday party for Milton Berle at the Waldorf-Astoria, she noticed Barbara Walters in the audience.</p>
        <p>''The rest of the house was with me, but she wasn't laughing, just looking at me, kind of studying me,'' Ms. Behar said. ''It really puzzled me. A few days later I got a call from her. She told me she had never seen me before and was watching me, studying me, with the idea of asking me to be on this new morning show she was producing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Behar had to ''fit in with the other girls,'' she said, and since ''we meshed pretty quickly,'' the cast was set. She was originally signed to appear in Ms. Walters' stead as ''the older woman'' in a chronologically based quartet then composed of Star Jones, a lawyer; Meredith Viera, the TV journalist; Debbie Matenopoulos, a TV host, and Ms. Walters. Her irreverent wit soon caught on and she became a daily regular.</p>
        <p>As ''The View'' enters its fourth year, Ms. Behar has become a daytime household name.</p>
        <p>She shares her house in the Hamptons with her longtime boyfriend, Steve Janowitz, who teaches at a junior high school in the Bronx, and, she said, often writes the material she uses about him. (She added that she must get permission from her daughter, Eve, before mentioning her in the act).</p>
        <p>Despite her public persona, she and Mr. Janowitz enjoy a relatively quiet life in the Hamptons. While she will occasionally appears at benefits  -- ''Are there parties I'm not invited to?'' she asked, laughing -- they are not part of the fabled social scene.</p>
        <p>''I like being near the beach,'' she said. ''Rather, I like knowing the beach is here and we even go occasionally after 6 when we can walk the dog. I love it out here. The air, the light. And there's a lot to do -- foreign films at the Sag Harbor movie, the wonderful restaurants and the antique shows. This weekend alone there are three shows.''</p>
        <p>At these shows -- and at ''K-Mart, King Kullen and flea markets'' as well as pricey, posh food boutiques -- Ms. Behar is frequently recognized, she said. ''But nobody bugs me,'' either in the Hamptons or in Manhattan, where she lives full time. Sometimes she even goes unrecognized, when she ignores Ms. Walters's advice ''to never go out without makeup and being well-dressed.</p>
        <p>''But then I open my mouth and people know who I am. It's my voice. You know, I haven't been famous for very long and I don't leave the house expecting to be recognized. So when I'm shopping, I try to keep my mouth shut.''</p>
        <p>Her voice is what led to her booking at the Jewish Arts Festival. ''The committee which suggests what performers we should hire just assumed she was Jewish,'' said Rea Jacobs, the executive director of the festival, which takes place today and tomorrow at the Suffolk Y-J.C.C. in Commack.</p>
        <p>''Everybody thinks she's Jewish,'' Ms. Jacobs said of Ms. Behar. ''Her humor is Jewish humor. Her voice has a Jewish inflection. We were surprised when we discovered she was Italian, but it didn't matter. Jews and Italians are very close.''</p>
        <p>Joy Occhiuto, who has been Joy Behar since she was 22 and married a Sephardic Jew, was amused by the mix-up, which she said happens often.</p>
        <p>''It's a Jewish crowd, so I'll gear the act toward that crowd,'' Ms. Behar said. ''Talk about the political scene. Sure, about Lieberman. On TV my persona is tamer, less risque, less biased. On stage -- I'm also playing Harrah's in Atlantic City from Sept. 15 through 17 and appearing with Regis Philbin in West Point on Sept. 23 -- I'm the same person. Just freer. But, like Popeye said, 'I am what I am.' ''</p>
        <p>With more more than 100 performers including David Amram, Jerry Stiller, Oscar Brand and the cast of ''Forbidden Broadway'' appearing on five stages, the 16th Annual International Jewish Arts Festival of Long Island is from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. today and tomorrow at the Suffolk Y-J.C.C. on Hauppauge Road in Commack.
