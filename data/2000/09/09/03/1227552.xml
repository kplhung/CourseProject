        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Every year, like a fine Swiss watch, we get another Times article titled something like ''Where Are the Young Composers?'' or ''What Will the Musical Theater Do Without New Writers?'' Being a hard-working, not-yet-famous composer and writer, these articles make my bile rise.</p>
        <p>The latest article, ''Needed: A Think Tank for Promising Talent'' by Stuart Ostrow [Aug. 27], supposes that we need a school for musical theater. Baloney. Writers, directors, designers, actors et al. learn theater best by just doing it. That's not to say that one doesn't need an academic grounding, but the knowledge that's important comes only by the process of being and working in a real theater. After that, it's a matter of writing well and getting the favorable attention of newspapers. Where and how does one just put up a show? Find a place! A barn if you have to. Go to Don't Tell Mama. Go to a nonprofit theater group and hire a few actors for a reading. They are cheap.</p>

        <p>The latest article, ''Needed: A Think Tank for Promising Talent'' by Stuart Ostrow [Aug. 27], supposes that we need a school for musical theater. Baloney.

        <p>There are many great teachers who can show you the basics of the theater, but ultimately you will need to find your own voice. Does Mr. Ostrow really think that great theater will come out of an institution like Princeton? (I'm imagining a musical comedy by Milton Babbitt.) Keep the theater out of the classroom as much as possible. The best theater is written out in the world.</p>
