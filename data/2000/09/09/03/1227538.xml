        <p>AFTER winning WBAB's homegrown-talent contest in 1996, the rock band Nine Days went on to sign a contract with 550/Epic Records, and its debut single, ''Absolutely (Story About a Girl)'' became a Top 10 hit.</p>
        <p>Since then, record companies have looked to Long Island to see what other treasures might be lurking in local clubs and recording studios.</p>
        <p>One group that hopes to reap the benefits of that attention is the band that was runner-up to Nine Days in the WBAB contest, Early Edison.</p>
        <p>''We just received a phone call from Album Network magazine,'' said Tom Ashton, the band's founder, guitarist, vocalist and primary songwriter. ''They called Long Island retail to see who was selling and they wanted to interview us. They sense there's an element of 'What's going on out there?' ''</p>
        <p>Early Edison is doing several things to stand out from the hundreds of wannabes.</p>
        <p>The first thing the seven-year-old band did, after several incarnations, was to regroup. Mr. Ashton, 29, teamed up again with his original bandmates, Rob Coffin on guitar and Chris Santiago on drums, and added Tom Wendling on bass.</p>
        <p>Their goal was to create alternative pop, a clever mix of Bob Mould's alienated sonics and Ray Davies's catchy hooks. They began working on a new demo in 1999, produced by Tony Maimone, the former bassist for the archetypal art-punk bands Pere Ubu, They Might Be Giants and Mr. Mould.</p>
        <p>''Early Edison is a really fresh, high-energy pop group,'' Mr. Maimone said. ''They're really, really good players and they have a sense of humor.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Maimone's input, the band members knew they had more than a demo on their hands. This was to become their second album. (Their debut, ''Devotion and Deceit,'' was recorded in 1994.) They hired Joel Hamilton, of Everclear fame, to help mix the new album.</p>
        <p>''We had a low budget but the right people,'' said Mr. Ashton, a Mattituck native who has a day job as a corporate librarian. ''Although it took us a long time to get this finished, we didn't sacrifice any quality. It was well worth the wait.''</p>
        <p>Their CD, released in June, has been positively received by the press, the retailers and the public.</p>
        <p>''We knew we had to begin promoting ourselves,'' Mr. Ashton said. ''We had to get ourselves out of the pack in terms of identity.''</p>
        <p>So they formed Pop Conspiracy Productions, an alliance with two other promising Long Island bands, This Island Earth and Iridesense. There is strength in unity, and through P.C.P., the bands pool their resources through joint advertising and shared mailing lists. A recent joint performance (a release party for Early Edison's CD) attracted 750 fans to Mulcahy's in Wantagh. That's the kind of figure record companies like to hear.</p>
        <p>Early Edison mixes the alternative toughness of the late-1980's Minneapolis music scene and the lyrical and infectious melodicism of succeeding British invasion bands. If groups like Early Edison and This Island Earth manage to get national exposure, joining the similar-sounding Nine Days, a truly identifiable Long Island sound would be created.</p>
        <p>''The problem with creating a Long Island scene,'' Mr. Ashton said, ''is that there is no singular area, no one location or street to gather. So we need to remain aggressive, assertive and active. But a lot of us grew up listening to all that British music on WLIR so we have some of the same influences, and maybe that's what accounts for Long Island's pop sound.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Ashton sympathizes with established bands' dislike for song-swapping sites like Napster, he says it is advantageous for unsigned bands like Early Edison. ''They download 'Alice,' and then after they hear it, we see that they come back and start zipping out our other songs. Then they go to www.cdbaby.com  and buy our album.</p>
        <p>''It's like being played on a 100,000-watt radio station. We just got a request for our album from a radio station in Blackpool, England.'' The record is now No. 1 on that station.</p>
        <p>The band members have recently completed a mass mailing to fanzines around the country and in the fall they plan to take time from their day jobs and conduct a small East Coast tour.</p>
        <p>''Alice'' is a classic Elvis Costello-styled rock song, cutting across many genres. ''I think 'Alice' is a classic rock song,'' Mr. Maimone said.</p>
        <p>Then there is ''Demographically Pleasing'':</p>
        <p>I'm just a skinny white boy</p>
        <p>Who comes from 'Lawn Guyland.'</p>
        <p>I like sports, I like movies,</p>
        <p>I think malls are kind of groovy,</p>
        <p>And I dig that alternative rock.</p>
        <p>And now I've got it made in the shade,</p>
        <p>'cause I'm demographically pleasing.</p>
        <p>The bouncy singalong, while more a novelty song than ''Alice,'' is indicative of the band's sense of humor and sense of self. And now they have 30 more songs ready for their next CD, some of which sound more subtle and melancholic than the past.</p>
        <p>''That's what I get for reading too much Flannery O' Connor,'' Mr. Ashton said.</p>
