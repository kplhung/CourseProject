        <p>ON a recent weeknight in August, the commotion at Mr. Chow belied all conventional thinking about what goes on in New York during the very end of summer. Presumably, nothing goes on -- and the kind of nothing involving no ones -- because all the someones are busy doing nothing somewhere else.</p>
        <p>But here's how the somebody map of Mr. Chow, the eatery on East 57th Street, read that night, a Tuesday: Marin Hopper, Elle's fashion director, stood at the bar waiting for her table just a foot or two away from John Cusack, the actor, who was seated in the restaurant's coveted spot above the main dining room, which meant that if he cared to (but he probably didn't) he could glance over at James Truman, Conde Nast's editorial director eating with Samantha Boardman, the socialite, who in turn could wave to her sister, Serena, seated a few tables away. Mr. Cusack was chatting with two bodyguards, phone cords sprouting out around their ears, who were minding a young man who looked an awful lot like Wyclef Jean, the hip-hop performer. As it turned out, the young man wasn't Wyclef Jean, but the mistake was an easy one to make since he, like Puffy Combs, has been eating at Mr. Chow quite a lot this summer; last week, he showed up twice. (When Mr. Cusack's dinner companion arrived, by the way, she was Uma Thurman.)</p>

        <p>ON a recent weeknight in August, the commotion at Mr. Chow belied all conventional thinking about what goes on in New York during the very end of summer.

        <p>But here's how the somebody map of Mr. Chow, the eatery on East 57th Street, read that night, a Tuesday: Marin Hopper, Elle's fashion director, stood at the bar waiting for her table just a foot or two away from John Cusack, the actor, who was seated in the restaurant's coveted spot above the main dining room, which meant that if he cared to (but he probably didn't) he could glance over at James Truman, Conde Nast's editorial director eating with Samantha Boardman, the socialite, who in turn could wave to her sister, Serena, seated a few tables away. Mr. Cusack was chatting with two bodyguards, phone cords sprouting out around their ears, who were minding a young man who looked an awful lot like Wyclef Jean, the hip-hop performer. As it turned out, the young man wasn't Wyclef Jean, but the mistake was an easy one to make since he, like Puffy Combs, has been eating at Mr. Chow quite a lot this summer; last week, he showed up twice. (When Mr. Cusack's dinner companion arrived, by the way, she was Uma Thurman.)</p>
        <p>Michael Chow, owner of the three restaurants that bear his name, never intended to deliver diced squab to the unremarkable. But for a good portion of the 1990's it was largely the cachet-deficient who showed up, not only in New York, but also in the Mr. Chows in Los Angeles and London. ''There were about five years there when you could have shot a cannon off in the place and no one would have heard it,'' said Chris Denton, the maitre d'hotel of the Los Angeles Mr. Chow.</p>
        <p>In the past year or so, though, the Mr. Chow here has re-emerged as a destination for all subspecies of the moneyed and glamorous, with dumpling connoisseurs from the suburbs there, too. It's in the pantheon of Manhattan restaurants whose patrons come less for the food than to be with their own kind -- like Michael's, for the publishing crowd, and Swifty's, for ladies of a certain position. But Mr. Chow attracts two kinds, standing out as the theater of artifice where the worlds of fashion and hip-hop play out their fascination with each other every night, even if they don't actually mingle.</p>
        <p>''It's such an incredible mix,'' remarked Marvet Britto, a publicity agent and Mr. Chow regular, who represents hip-hop and sports stars, including Foxy Brown and Latrell Sprewell. ''Damon Dash is having dinner with Harvey Weinstein,'' she said, referring to a partner of Roc-A-Fella Records and a co-chairman of Miramax, respectively. ''And Puffy could be having dinner with Diane Von Furstenberg.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chow opened his third restaurant, a sleek art-filled room, in 1979, five years after he got a branch going in Beverly Hills and 11 years after he established himself with a London spot in Knightsbridge that catered to the kind of people who would be parodied in the Austin Powers films decades later.</p>
        <p>By the time Mr. Chow moved to Manhattan, Tina Lutz, the model, jeweler and fashion muse, had already become Mrs. Michael Chow, thanks in part to an introduction made by the British designer Zandra Rhodes. Tina Chow brought the fashion crowd to reign at the new restaurant in New York alongside Andy Warhol, Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Some artists and dealers remained loyal to Mr. Chow during the 90's slump, a period when Mr. Chow himself, distracted by his interests in art and film, decided to pay less attention to the business's operations. Following the death of Tina Chow from AIDS in 1992, the fashion world moved on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chow recaptured some of its glitz when the hip-hop contingent discovered it, following the record producers and industry executives who have their offices nearby. Most say it took off about two years ago with a flurry of record release parties. Steven Stoute, president of Black Music Division at Interscope Records, gave  his 28th birthday party at Mr. Chow about two years ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Combs was already a frequent diner, and in the spring of last year, when he started his men's clothing line, Sean John, he took over all of Mr. Chow for a party. It created a setting in which people like Kal Ruttenstein, the longtime fashion director at Bloomingdale's, were sharing chicken skewers with people like Heavy D. By the end of the year, Celine had its office Christmas dinner there on the same night that Lil' Kim was also holding court.</p>
        <p>Soon after the Sean John party, Paul Wilmot, the fashion publicity agent, who represents Mr. Combs and who had gone to Mr. Chow on and off for years, reclaimed his status as a regular. When Mr. Wilmot joined Conde Nast in 1991, Anna Wintour was the host of a party there for him. ''I'm sure there are fabulous places in Chinatown, but you have to look in a Zagat's and you have to tell me how to get there and the lighting is horrible,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is fortunate that the lighting at Mr. Chow is not horrible, because if the restaurant encourages anything, it encourages you to look, and if fashion types in sheer, strappy dresses and hip-hop singers slathered in roped gold and mink share anything, it is the wish not to go unnoticed. The back wall is mirrored, and the open staircase leading into the dining area -- surely the subject of more discussion than the dumplings -- ensures that every entrance has a note of Norma Desmond.</p>
        <p>''It's all so Tom Ford,'' Ms. Hopper of Elle observed. In her view, it is Mr. Ford's aesthetic -- his worship of the late 70's, his sense of streamlined glamour, his embrace of the culture of display -- that has, in part, prompted the fashion world to revisit a restaurant that conveys such debauched, lacquered elegance.</p>
        <p>''A few years ago, Tom Ford designed an event for AIDS Project Los Angeles right down to the Lucite salt and pepper shakers,'' Ms. Marin explained. ''I realized that what he really communicated to me designwise was Mr. Chow's.'' Ms. Hopper has returned to Mr. Chow, eating there about once a week.</p>
        <p>When someone like Mr. Stoute is asked what keeps him returning to Mr. Chow, it isn't the subject of interior design that comes up. ''I like it because the hosts are user-friendly,'' Mr. Stoute said. ''They don't make you feel stuffy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chow occupies an odd place in the New York dining orbit because it manages to be unusually pretentious and democratic at the same time. Mr. Chow is a Chinese restaurant in which it is rare to escape paying less than $100 a person. In the 1980's, the restaurant, in an effort to seem even more clublike than it already was, kept a sign-in book. One night, Mr. Basquiat threw a plate of food on it and slammed it shut. Menus have never been provided; you are supposed to know enough to have the green prawns, the crispy beef, the sauteed string beans. On a recent visit, when this reporter asked for menus, her waiter tried to convince her to let him put together a meal for the table. When she insisted on seeing the menu, he eventually sent over one for all three people.</p>
        <p>All that aside, Mr. Chow has become perhaps the only expensive restaurant south of 96th Street with an obvious racial mix. ''You don't see it anywhere else,'' said Ms. Britto, the publicity agent, who likes to take some credit for Mr. Chow's popularity with the hip-hop world, because she has introduced so many clients to it.</p>
        <p>''The hip-hop set feels comfortable there, and they don't feel comfortable everywhere,'' Ms. Britto said. ''Nas walks into Mr. Chow's with a do-rag on,'' Ms. Britto said, referring to the rap performer, ''and people don't look at him like he's crazy. He walks into Le Cirque with a do-rag and people are going to look at him like he's crazy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chow, in fact, has music-industry roots. It was Jerry Moss, the co-founder of A&amp;M Records, who helped bring Mr. Chow to Los Angeles more than 25 years ago. ''In a certain way it's a beautifully public restaurant,'' Mr. Moss said.</p>
        <p>And soon Mr. Chow will no longer be the only inclusive-exclusive spot in the rarefied East 50's. Jimmy's, the Latin supper club in the Bronx that has drawn everyone from players on the Yankees to Jennifer Lopez to Ian Schrager, will open just east of Mr. Chow on 57th Street, possibly by fall and in part inspired by the restaurant's success at nexus building.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Chow's closes early, and they don't play music,'' Phil Montana, executive vice president of Jimmy's, said. ''All those people need a place to go.''</p>
