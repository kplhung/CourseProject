        <p>I CAN see it now: killer bamboo marches across Central Park. That was my first reaction when I heard that the Horticultural Society of New York is holding a festival this month, with the American Bamboo Society, that actually encourages people to grow this plant.</p>
        <p>''Don't say invasive -- say overly aggressive,'' Michael Alfano, president of the society's northeastern chapter, said, standing by an airy hedge of Phyllostachys bissetii in his garden in Port Washington, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Phyllostachys, or giant bamboo, can form beautiful groves of canes -- culms, they are correctly called -- from 10 feet to more than 100 feet tall, depending on the species.</p>
        <p>The culms are wonderfully varied in color: green, yellow, golden orange; yellow with a vertical green stripe; green with a yellow groove; mottled green and black, like snakeskin; as jet black as a Steinway.</p>
        <p>Phyllostachys is a running bamboo, so called because it extends rhizomes underground, sending up shoots that grow into tall canes. If you don't want it to spread, you have to be vigilant.</p>
        <p>''If you spend a little time each fall harvesting the shoots, you won't have a problem,'' Mr. Alfano said. The shoots of phyllostachys are edible, especially those of P. dulcis, or sweetshoot bamboo, which has a sweet, nutty flavor. Cut them just beneath the soil, like asparagus, peel back the leaves and eat the crunchy white shoots raw or steamed. But remember, if you don't want that baby to spread, snap off all its shoots.</p>
        <p>Some people use plastic barriers, buried three feet in the ground, with three inches above. ''But the runners will just go right over the top and wander on,'' Mr. Alfano said.</p>
        <p>The P. bissetii in his yard has vigorous, dark green seven-year-old culms 20 feet tall, and their flexible, leafy stems sway and sigh on the wind. ''The neighbors love it,'' he said. It remains evergreen all winter, and it's magical in the snow.</p>
        <p>Use common sense when planting. ''Bamboos can be aggressive and destroy neighboring plants, so don't put them next to anything you deeply care about,'' said Dr. Peter Del Tredici, the director of living collections at the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University. ''But it's not invasive in the sense of spreading by seed, on the wind or by a bird. It's all vegetative.''</p>
        <p>If you plant a variety that's an enthusiastic runner, just make sure you have room to mow around it so it can't take over, he advised.</p>
        <p>Dr. Del Tredici moved the arboretum's bamboo, which was growing too vigorously, to very poor soil.</p>
        <p>''I got the backhoe out and put them in a roadbed where we had trouble growing anything,'' he said. They're doing fine -- growing slowly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alfano suggests planting a running bamboo near water, which it doesn't like, or on the edge of a pine woods or in shade. Or sink it in a pot, and pop up the pot once in a while, to snip off the runners. Many running bamboos are not hardy in the Northeast, but they make beautiful potted plants for the terrace or garden in summer and a cool, sunny room in winter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alfano leaned down to an elegantly sheathed seven-inch shoot poking out of a pot of Phyllostachys aurea koi, a giant golden bamboo with a green groove, which is not hardy in the North.</p>
        <p>''When you see one of these, just snap it off,'' he said, adding that in Texas, this little shoot could grow to a 25-foot culm in weeks.</p>
        <p>Bamboo is a member of the grass family, just like lawns, ornamental grasses and corn. Key to life in Asia, it is becoming increasingly popular in the West as a landscape plant, or as a sustainable supply of beautiful, sturdy material for things like trellises, flutes, furniture and houses. And about 300 kinds of bamboo, from 6 inches to 60 feet, are hardy in the New York area, Mr. Alfano said.</p>
        <p>He fell for bamboo nine years ago, after he dug a pond in his backyard, stocked it with koi and wanted some Asian plants to go with it. That first pond has grown into a series of ponds and waterfalls terraced down the precipitous slope off the backyard, extending a good 80 feet down. The rocky niches are perfect for containing bamboo.</p>
        <p>All along the house are small, delicate varieties, like Plioblastus fortuneii, a dwarf variegated bamboo with green-and-white-striped leaves, and some elegant clumpings of Phyllostachys nigra, a luminous black bamboo.</p>
        <p>Another running type, but well behaved, is Sudasa japonica, with graceful narrow culms perfect for making arrows. Mr. Alfano planted this clumping variety from a one-gallon pot four years ago, and it's spread only about three feet. Another clumping species, Bambusa ventricosa, affectionately called Buddha's Belly, swells gently between nodes, and its green leaves have yellow stripes. B. ventricosa Kimmei has yellow culms striped with green.</p>
        <p>If any little shoot appears from an overly aggressive runner, Mr. Alfano simply eats it.</p>
        <p>Some bamboos like sun, others shade; some have delicate filigreed leaves, others' leaves are wide straps, like those of an amaryllis. Indokalmis terralotis, for example, has such wide leaves they're used for wrapping food. It's a shade lover, as is Fargessi nitida, a delicate clumper, whose slender leaves turn crispy in the sun.</p>
        <p>Many of these varieties, as well as the art of cultivation, will be discussed at Bamboo Fest 2000 next weekend at the Horticultural Society, 128 West 58th Street, in Manhattan. (Information: (212) 757-0915, extension 200.) The weekend begins Friday evening, with a bamboo art show and a Japanese flute concert. There's a rare plant auction on Saturday. Lectures cover such varied topics as bamboo for northern gardeners, bamboo cultivation, bamboo flowering (a rare event), bamboo bonsai, bamboo basketry and all kinds of uses for this plant so dear to the heart of Asia.</p>
        <p>CUTTINGS  Correction:  September 7, 2000, Thursday  The Cuttings column in Sunday Styles this week, about growing bamboo, misstated the dates of Bamboo Fest 2000 at the Horticultural Society of New York. It will be held from the evening of Sept. 15 through Sept. 17, not this weekend. Information: (212) 757-0915, extension 200.</p>
