        <p>Katherine Choy was an innovative potter whose work showed the Oriental influence of Hong Kong, where she was born and raised until her teenage years, as well as the experimental and abstract art forms that were just beginning to be explored by potters in the United States in the late 1950's.</p>
        <p>She was one of the few women potters to explore sculptural forms in clay.</p>

        <p>She was one of the few women potters to explore sculptural forms in clay.</p>
        <p>Ms. Choy was a co-founder of the Clay Art Center in Port Chester, N.Y., in 1957 which had the mission of promoting the art of clay and encouraging clay artists.</p>
        <p>At the same time she was helping set up the center, Ms. Choy produced more than 200 pieces of her own before her career was cut short when she died of pneumonia in 1958 at the age of 29.</p>
        <p>Her work will be on view at the Newark museum from through Jan. 7.</p>
