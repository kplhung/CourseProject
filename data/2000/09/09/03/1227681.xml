        <p>First, the handbag was minified in the form of baguettes and lipstick totes; now, it's the diaper bag's turn. This summer, chic moms have eschewed giant family-size carryalls for self-improvised carry-somes, switching to pared-down pocketbooks with just enough room to hold one or two diapers, a travel-packet of baby wipes and a tube of diaper balm. Presto, change-o -- the diaper baguette! ''City mothers don't want to be weighed down,'' said Fran D'Ambrosio, owner of the 57 Bank Street boutique in Southhampton, N.Y., where the store's embellished straw mini-bag ($64) sold out all summer to beach mothers, and whose beaded baguettes are serving the same purpose for fall. ''Moms are realizing they don't have to lug around the contents of the entire nursery. Now, they pack only the necessities.'' Other popular choices: LeSportsac's reversible zip-up Kiki bag (seen on the shoulders of celebrity mothers like Andie MacDowell and Christie Brinkley -- $55 to $68 at all LeSportsac stores), and Frederic Fekkai's Clementine bag in pastel wools for fall ($480 at Saks Fifth Avenue). For mothers who can't go quite that minimalist, Belly Basics has a drawstring backpack in black or green nylon ($86 at Bloomingdale's and bellybasics .com), with bottle pockets and changing pad -- so you don't have to use your Prada raincoat.</p>
