        <p>NIGHTFALL does not come gently to Matera. It's more like a flash flood rising from the bottom of the ravine.

        <p>NIGHTFALL does not come gently to Matera. It's more like a flash flood rising from the bottom of the ravine. One minute, I am watching a couple of bats wing over the rooftops beneath the hotel terrace where I sit. The next minute, they are invisible. The houses on the hill go gray as tombstones, and all that is human and terrestrial turns pale and wan.</p>
        <p>Up in the heavens, though, something like the Creation is happening. The sky, a dome of crazy cobalt blue, is streaked with fresh phosphorus stars. A big coppery moon is pitched on the horizon, smoldering like the halo of a Byzantine Madonna.</p>
        <p>This must be something like the way the cosmos once unfolded every night before the watching eyes of Dark Ages villagers, or Homeric-era Greek wanderers, or the Paleolithic nomads who 15,000 years ago first burrowed in here and made their cave shelters in the sassi, the city's distinctive limestone cliffs. Art, myth, religion -- you can see how they grew out of nights like this. Some giant forces were at work out there, and it wouldn't be wise not to pay attention.</p>
        <p>Big thoughts like these hadn't yet crossed my mind when I began the day under brilliant April sunshine, barreling along the almost empty roads of the Basento Valley into the heart of Basilicata, in southeastern Italy. I was on my way back for a return look at Matera's frescoed cave churches, and to explore some even more remote corners of this remote and rugged region.</p>
        <p>The hilly part of southern Italy between the more populous coastlines of Campania and Puglia, Basilicata is a sort of Italian Appalachia, where nature hasn't been tamed by humans and the people don't like being bossed around, either. An Appalachia where at one time or another prehistoric shepherds, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Lombards, Saracens, Normans, Swabians and Albanians fleeing the Turks after the fall of Constantinople have passed through.</p>
        <p>My husband, Vittorio, was actually the one pushing the speed limit, while I read out an occasional passage from our faithful traveling companion, ''Christ Stopped at Eboli,'' by Carlo Levi. The road to Matera from Potenza, the regional capital, coasts along the valley, and once you get past a gargantuan snake of a modern housing project on Potenza's outskirts, scarcely another building appears except for a few tiny farmhouses. There are olive groves, stands of ilex, pine and cypress, and the glint of greenhouses on the hillsides. Along the way, there's the turnoff for Aliano, the village where in 1935, Levi, a painter who was a member of the anti-Fascist group Giustizia e Liberta from Turin, was sent into confinement by Mussolini.</p>
        <p>It was Levi, with his passionate account of his year in Basilicata, who first awakened cosmopolitan Italy to the flinty poverty and archaic dignity of this place. Trained as a physician, he went out to see the sick in their miserable homes. Many, back from America after a lifetime of hard work, now had nothing to protect them from endemic malaria but the little photo of Franklin D. Roosevelt that so often hung over a returned emigrant's bed. The reason their lives were so hard, they told him, was that Christ had never got farther than Eboli (a city toward Naples). Civilization, in other words, had never climbed these mountains.</p>
        <p>About beautiful Matera, Levi wrote that it was a ''sad, gray'' city that spiraled downward like the circles of Dante's Inferno, where ''men, women, children and beasts'' shared the same cramped caves. That vision of hell disturbed Italians from more prosperous regions, and after the war, there were calls to level the sassi. It didn't happen, but in 1952, old Matera was evacuated.</p>
        <p>Then in 1993, Unesco designated the sassi of Matera a World Heritage Site. It was an ironic and welcome turn of events for a town that still smarts under its onetime label, ''la vergogna nazionale,'' Italy's shame.</p>
        <p>Today, people are moving back into the old town, our guide, Giuseppe, tells us later that day as we gaze over the canyon carved by the Gravina torrent far below, before setting off on our tour. ''Let's just hope they don't start painting everything up,'' he says, narrowing his eyes fiercely at the freshly painted facade of a cave house that is just a whisper the green side of cement gray.</p>
        <p>He points out another one below us that has the faintest aura of yellow. ''The sassi are not in color,'' Giuseppe says. ''The sassi are black and white.''</p>
        <p>Ash gray inside and out, the dwellings in the sassi were hewn out of the natural caves and water cisterns that run through the chalky rock. Blocks were cut out and used to add front rooms and facades, some quite ornate. The roofs served as the roadbed to the level above, and there were gardens and little public squares on various levels.</p>
        <p>In a book about Matera's cave dwellings,  the Italian architect Pietro Laureano shows how they were designed around a sophisticated system to capture and store water, a precious resource here after the uplands were deforested by farming and grazing as far back as the Neolithic era. The caves have affinities with those of Cappadocia and the ancient city of Petra, among others around the Mediterranean, and they are anything but poor architecture, Laureano says. The sassi deteriorated badly under the Fascist regime, when paved roads wiped out all the green areas and public spaces, and economic conditions were so grim that people had to crowd into their storerooms and stables with their animals.</p>
        <p>Around the seventh century, when this part of Italy answered to the Byzantine empire, Greek-rite hermit monks started to use the grottoes as primitive chapels. Those Easterners were chased away by Roman Catholic Benedictines in the 12th century, but religious art here continued to have a strong Byzantine flavor. In the wall paintings of the little Matera church of Santa Maria de Idris, a stylized Virgin appears with a precious amphora of water. One of the flanking saints is giving the Latin benediction. Another holds his fingers in the perpendicular Orthodox way.</p>
        <p>In time, many of the chapels became houses, wine caves or refuges for shepherds. In Santa Lucia alle Malve, for example, you can see where metal rods were stuck into the decorated walls so that wool could be carded. A large piece of painted surface with a figure of St. Agatha was converted into the pillar of an old kitchen.</p>
        <p>Next morning, up on the plain over the ravine, the air smells of wild thyme and nepitella, a kind of wild mint. Hawks are circling overhead -- falchi grillai, or cricket hawks, we're told. This area, too, is honeycombed with chapels.</p>
        <p>In one low, deep cave, travelers have carved hundreds of crosses into the rock. On the wall, there's a sober, beautiful red and blue painting of the Madonna del Melograno (Virgin of the Pomegranate) at the Annunciation. Others to look out for include San Pietro in Principibus, Santa Maria della Colomba and the Cripta del Peccato Originale, with its delicate 10th-century frescoes on the theme of original sin.</p>
        <p>From Matera, the road turns north toward Venosa and the traces of a different era. When the Romans first marched through these parts around 300 B.C., they found the Lucanians, a local people who roasted their meat on long bronze skewers, drank a lot of heavy red wine and celebrated Dionysus. The Latin poet Horace was born here in 65 B.C., when this was a thriving provincial Roman city.</p>
        <p>Today, it looks like a toy town, with diminutive two-story buildings decorated with iron railings, a big castle and a major archaeological site on the outskirts. On the way there, we have to stop and wait for a large, pokey flock of sheep.</p>
        <p>In Venosa are the ruins of an amphitheater, a second-century B.C. Roman domus and a thermal bath with mosaic floors from Imperial times. Down the road, several narrow tunnels and tiny cubicles are all that are left of late-Roman-era Jewish catacombs. Early Christians built a church on top of a Roman temple, and on top of that stand the grandiose ruins of a unfinished Benedictine abbey, where the Norman conquerer Robert Guiscard is said to be buried.</p>
        <p>A tour of the small but thoroughly interesting collection of the national archaeological museum in the dazzling, wind-swept Norman castle of Melfi, not far from Venosa, gives you an idea of how much wealth a fifth-century B.C. Lucanian nobleman could afford to take to the grave. He had fanciful crowns shaped of leaves of beaten gold, amber necklaces imported from the Baltic, Etruscan pottery and red-figure Attic vases, glass pitchers and bronze serving plates, and a set of bronze armor with a scary riot-gear-style helmet, made to imitate the weaponry of Greek hoplite warriors. Those luxury goods were supposed to allow the departed to carry their reputations to the beyond. And in a way they have, because we wouldn't know much about them without their tombs to dig up.</p>
        <p>Heading south from Melfi the next day, we stop at Rapolla, a pinched, hilly little town of low white houses that looks like a village in Greece or Albania. In a tiny square, some long-legged girls are playing volleyball without a net. I wonder if they have been to the museum in Melfi to see the fine imperial Roman lady on the beautiful sarcophagus (imported from Asia Minor) that was dug up in their town. The languid, liquid marble folds of her robe suggest a level of comfort and ease that isn't known in these parts today.</p>
        <p>Rapolla's onetime cathedral of Santa Lucia is locked, but a passer-by calls her neighbor and gets the key. The graceful, spiritual little church, built in 1200, has just been meticulously restored, with glass floor panels so that you can peer down and see the caves of the Byzantine mystics on which it was built.</p>
        <p>Back on the road, we drive back and forth for nearly an hour looking for the turnoff to another cave chapel dedicated to Santa Lucia. We are just about to give up when we find the road, leading into the woods. Ferns, nettles and violets grow up to the door of the tiny, whitewashed church. We peer in through an iron grate: there are a couple of wooden benches and many vases of fresh flowers. The apse is painted floor to ceiling in stylized red and black scenes from the saint's life. The floor is mossy where the chapel runs back into the rock.</p>
        <p>Our next stop is Rionero in Vulture, which like Rapolla and the nearby town of Barile (not to mention Matera) was repopulated by Albanian Christians fleeing the Turks in the 15th and 16th centuries. Today, the local dialect is heavily inflected with Albanian, one more reminder of how close Basilicata is to the Balkans.</p>
        <p>Rionero, on the bottom slopes of Mount Vulture, a spent volcano, is the region's prime wine-growing area. The excellent local wine -- made with the aglianico vines imported some 2,700 years ago by the settlers of Magna Graecia -- has had a DOC, an official wine denomination, since 1971.</p>
        <p>The aglianico del Vulture red is rich and clean, good company for the stewed wild cardoncelli mushrooms, the creamy fave e cicoria (bean puree with greens), the home-made scorze di mandorla and cavatelli pasta, the grilled sausages flavored with fennel, and the many interesting sheep and cow cheeses found here. These include the rare caciocavallo podolico, made from the exotically flavored milk of a cow that grazes only the highest pastures, chewing up rare grasses and wildflowers, tender mushroom caps or rucola muralis, the tiny-leafed spicy wild rocket. (We lunched on slivers of that wonderfully spicy, crumbly yellow cheese from Latteria Rizzi, a cheese shop in Matera.)</p>
        <p>We hike partway up Mount Vulture hoping to catch a glimpse of some of those high-grazing cows, but no luck. What we can just see are the pretty Monticchio lakes nearby, where, Horace tells us, he once ran away from his wet nurse as an infant and got lost in the woods. Fortunately -- befitting a baby who was going to become a famous poet -- magical doves came and covered him with bay and myrtle leaves, so that the bears and vipers wouldn't harm him.</p>
        <p>Heading back toward Potenza and Naples, we make a last stop at Castel Lagopesole, a big square reddish castle built in 1242 by Frederick II of Swabia (or of Hohenstaufen), who ruled southern Italy. It dominates the heights so absolutely that a chicken couldn't have crossed the road in the valley below without the Hohenstaufens knowing about it.</p>
        <p>The sun is hot and a cuckoo begins to hoot, loud as a foghorn. If you think of it in premodern terms, says Vittorio, who likes to read history, Frederick was probably the most tolerant and enlightened signore who ever ruled these parts. What would Basilicata be like today if his line had survived and the corrupt, absentee Angevins, Spanish and Bourbons had never gained control?</p>
        <p>Much more prosperous, but possibly not so wild and beautiful, I hazard.</p>
        <p>''Hmm,'' Vittorio says. ''Yes, that's probably right.''</p>
        <p>A forgotten corner of Italy, full of surprises</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>Matera is 170 miles east of Naples on the A3 Autostrada to Potenza, then Strada Statale 407. There are flights to Naples and Bari, which is about 40 miles from Matera. Renting a car is advisable; train service in Basilicata is very slow.</p>
        <p>Although the summer heat is not unbearable, April through June and September through December are the most pleasant months to visit.</p>
        <p>For information on Basilicata, contact the APT (tourist office) in Matera, (39-0835) 331-983, or in Potenza, (39-0971) 411-839. Carlo Levi's 1945 book ''Christ Stopped at Eboli'' (Noonday Press, $13) remains a wonderful guide to the region.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Don't expect luxury hotels in Basilicata, although all of these offer a telephone, TV and minibar.</p>
        <p>Grande Albergo, Corso XVIII Agosto 46, Potenza 85100, telephone and fax (39-0971) 410-220, is Potenza's most modern hotel. The 70 rooms offer spectacular views of the valley below. A double with bath, including breakfast, costs about $85, at the rate of 2,150 lire to the dollar.</p>

''Hostel'' suggests bunk beds and shared bathrooms, but there are no privations at this delightful place built right into the sassi, with superlative views. Our cool, white room, on two levels, had a large private terrace and a funky bathroom carved out of the rock. The bar, breakfast room and 14 other guest rooms are also in converted caves (four rooms have air-conditioning). Doubles with bath are $65, breakfast included.</p>
        <p>Albergo Italia, Via Ridola 5, Matera 75100; (39-0835) 333-561, fax (39-0835) 330-087. This elegant, old-fashioned hotel in the old city has nice views of the sassi. All rooms are air-conditioned and some have antiques. Doubles are $85, with breakfast.</p>
        <p>Hotel Due Pini, Piazzale Stazione, Melfi, 85025, (39-0972) 21031, fax (39-0972) 21608, is a simple 48-room hotel, offering excellent value right downtown. Doubles with bath start at $50, breakfast included.</p>
        <p>Hotel La Pergola, Via L. Lavista 27-31, Rionero in Vulture, (39-0972) 721-179, fax (39-0972) 721-819, is well situated for exploring Mount Vulture. This modest, comfortable hotel has 43 rooms and a large, cheery restaurant with a good local wine list. Doubles with bath cost $55, including breakfast.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Simple, rustic and based on the freshest of ingredients, the delicious food of Basilicata is what the shepherds might have eaten in Arcadia. Specialties include grilled meat and homemade sausages, wild mushrooms and field greens, fresh sheep- and cow's-milk cheeses, and distinctive wheat pastas like manate, cavatelli and strascinati, shaped roughly like little caps or boats.</p>
        <p>Ristorante Due Torri, Via Due Torri 6-8, Potenza, (39-0971) 411-661, serves regional specialties in a nicely restored space in a twin-towered Aragonese fortification in old Potenza. Dishes include pureed fava beans with dark, winey-flavored sauteed chicory and pepperoncino in sauce; homemade pastas; grilled pecorino, and creamy sheep's milk ricotta with wild honey and nuts. Two-course dinner for two, with local aglianico wine, costs about $45. Closed Sunday.</p>
        <p>Le Botteghe, Piazza San Pietro Barisano 22, Matera, telephone and fax (39-0835) 344-072, is in an elegant, restored cave in the sassi. The fine regional menu begins with extensive antipasti, like fresh little rounds of mozzarella, prosciutto and rocket, and local hams. Scorze d'amelle pasta, like large orecchiette, are served with cime di rapa (turnip greens). Grilled sausages are delicately flavored with fennel. Two-course lunch for two with aglianico wine, about $45. Closed Wednesday and Sunday night.</p>
        <p>La Buca, Via San Pardo 95, Matera, (39-0835) 261-984, is a simple place serving local specialties: baked veal shank with onions, pasta and cicerchie, a type of bean that grows wild in the area. Two courses for two with wine, about $40. Closed Sunday night and Monday.</p>
        <p>Vaddone, Contrada Santa Abruzzese, Melfi 85025, (39-0972) 24323, is a family restaurant offering good local salami, cheese and olives, grilled sausages and lamb, and local fruit. Two-course dinner for two with wine, about $40. Closed Monday.</p>
        <p>What to See</p>
        <p>Because many sites are locked, you will need a guide to visit the sassi of Matera and the chiese rupestri, or cave churches. Freelance guides abound, but you're probably better off with one from an agency. Itinera, (39-0835) 263-259, and Nuovi Amici dei Sassi, (39-0835) 331-011, are among the reliable agencies for guides. For other suggestions, call the tourist office, (39-0835) 331-983, or ask at your hotel for an English-speaking guide. A reasonable price for a group of one to four is around $35 for a two-hour tour.</p>
