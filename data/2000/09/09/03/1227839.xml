        <p>It was a tough week for the Ford Motor Company.</p>
        <p>The auto giant admitted it was aware of tire failures on Explorer sport utility vehicles in Venezuela as early as 1998.</p>
        <p>A Superior Court judge in Alameda County, Calif., Michael E. Ballachey, largely agreed with complaints that  Ford knowingly installed defective ignition mechanisms in nearly two million Ford vehicles produced from 1983 to 1995. The judge said he intended to issue orders to recall and repair the vehicles. Analysts estimated the cost could run as high as $250 million.</p>
        <p>Ford refuted the finding, and predicted it would be reversed on appeal.</p>
