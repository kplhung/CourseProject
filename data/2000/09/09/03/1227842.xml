        <p>(Teams are listed in predicted order of finish)</p>
        <p>East</p>
        <p>1. Indianapolis Colts  1999 record: 13-3  STRENGTHS -- A three-headed monster on offense with quarterback Peyton Manning, receiver Marvin Harrison and running back Edgerrin James. There is, however, much more. An offensive line effective at both run and pass blocking. A complete tight end in Ken Dilger. Strong return and cover teams. The top-ranked offense in the American Conference last season that was pivotal in turning a 3-13 team in '98 into a 13-3 team in '99.</p>

        <p>(Teams are listed in predicted order of finish)</p>
        <p>East</p>
        <p>1. Indianapolis Colts  1999 record: 13-3  STRENGTHS -- A three-headed monster on offense with quarterback Peyton Manning, receiver Marvin Harrison and running back Edgerrin James. There is, however, much more. An offensive line effective at both run and pass blocking. A complete tight end in Ken Dilger. Strong return and cover teams. The top-ranked offense in the American Conference last season that was pivotal in turning a 3-13 team in '98 into a 13-3 team in '99.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- The Colts seek a championship defense. The defense last season on any given day ranged from superior to lousy. Not enough turnovers created and too many holes in the run defense -- the Colts last season allowed an average of 4.2 yards a carry.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- Playoffs, a certainty. Super Bowl, a shot.</p>
        <p>2. New England Patriots  1999 record: 8-8  STRENGTHS -- The new coach, Bill Belichick, knows the division better than most, and it is his preparation and in-game adjustments that should help lift the Patriots. Quarterback Drew Bledsoe appears rejuvenated, and that is much required: Bledsoe threw 21 interceptions last season and only 19 touchdown passes. Watch safety Lawyer Milloy, cornerback Ty Law and linebacker Willie McGinest produce Pro Bowl seasons.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Who will be the source of the running game? Kevin Faulk is a big back who now is required to take a big step. The rookie J.R. Redmond hopes to provide speed around the corner.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- New England will play a crisper game under Belichick. A smarter one, too.</p>
        <p>3. Buffalo Bills  1999 record: 11-5  STRENGTHS -- Winning quarterbacks in Rob Johnson and Doug Flutie. Ted Cottrell, the defensive coordinator, designer of the league's top-ranked defense last season. Reliable running game and dynamic receiver in Eric Moulds.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Definitive leadership is gone in Bruce Smith, Thurman Thomas and Kurt Schulz. New leadership must emerge.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- No miracles required to return to the playoffs.</p>
        <p>4. New York Jets  1999 record: 8-8  STRENGTHS -- Curtis Martin. He is a special player, capable of churning inside for tough yards and bouncing outside for big gains. He is a performance-oriented leader. Linebackers Mo Lewis and Bryan Cox help to set the tone on defense.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- A horrific schedule. It starts with Green Bay, New England, Buffalo and Tampa Bay. Also, will the Jets replace Keyshawn Johnson's big plays at receiver? And how will they respond to adversity under the new head coach, Al Groh?</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- Troublesome.</p>
        <p>5. Miami Dolphins  1999 record: 9-7  STRENGTHS -- Miami has one of the best defensive lines in the league, anchored by tackles Daryl Gardener and Tim Bowens and ends Jason Taylor and Trace Armstrong; their backups are also good. Cornerback Sam Madison is a Pro Bowl talent. Linebacker Zach Thomas is fiery and tenacious. The new head coach, Dave Wannstedt, knows how to teach defense. Olindo Mare, the place-kicker, missed on only 5 of 44 field-goal attempts last season.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Quarterback. Dan Marino is gone. The replacements, Jay Fiedler and Damon Huard, look average.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- A pesky, late-season playoff spoiler.</p>
        <p>COACH TO WATCH</p>
        <p>Bill Belichick  New England Patriots  The Patriots want Bill Belichick to do two things -- put their house in order and create chaos in the A.F.C. East order. The New England players had run amok under their previous coach, Pete Carroll. Belichick has cracked them. Pricked them. They will play a cleaner, crisper brand of football. But equal to that task is Belichick's placing the Patriots schematically in better positions to win. Destroying the order of the division by game-planning, making in-game adjustments and creating misery for Peyton Manning, Rob Johnson, Vinny Testaverde and the rest of the division's quarterbacks. That is Belichick's forte. As the defensive coordinator for the Jets he routinely accomplished that. Now as a head coach, able to do it all his way, Belichick can have as much impact in the division as any person in it. Expect that he will.</p>
        <p>Central</p>
        <p>1. Tennessee Titans  1999 record: 13-3  STRENGTHS -- The quarterback (Steve McNair), the running back (Eddie George), the new receiver (Carl Pickens), the tight end (Frank Wycheck), the defensive end (Jevon Kearse) and the head coach (Jeff Fisher). Tennessee, the Super Bowl runner-up, is loaded. And experienced. This is a bunch who won road playoff games last season against Indianapolis and Jacksonville on their way to the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>Weaknesses -- Can the Titans throw the ball downfield and put pressure on opponents with more big-play offense?</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- If Tennessee remains focused, it can be the class of the A.F.C.</p>
        <p>2. Jacksonville Jaguars  1999 record: 14-2  STRENGTHS -- Mark Brunell at quarterback ensures that Jacksonville is a contender, though injuries have plagued him in recent seasons. Fred Taylor at running back is one of the league's best. Few receivers have been as dependable as Jimmy Smith. And the addition of linebacker Hardy Nickerson, in from Tampa Bay, gives the defense a nastier bite.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- This has not been a mentally tough team in the playoffs. Two years ago the Jaguars fell apart in a playoff game against the Jets. They did it again last year against Tennessee.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- No question, a playoff club. But where is this team's head?</p>
        <p>3. Baltimore Ravens  1999 record: 8-8  STRENGTHS -- Ray Lewis is back, and that is good news for the defense. He leads a linebacking crew second to none in the league. Quarterback Tony Banks showed promise last season and looks for more. Shannon Sharpe, in from Denver, anchors the tight end position.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Consistency from the offense, which ranked 30th in its red zone attack last season.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- Bright.</p>
        <p>4. Cincinnati Bengals  1999 record: 4-12  STRENGTHS -- Akili Smith to the rookie receiver Peter Warrick. This combination has the potential to be the signature one in the league this season. Running back Corey Dillon is valuable and exciting, too. Tremain Mack led the conference in kickoff-return average (27.1) last season.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- The Bengals ranked last in average points (28.8) allowed per game last season.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- Encouraging. At least the Bengals will be more fun to watch.</p>
        <p>5. Pittsburgh Steelers  1999 record: 6-10  STRENGTHS -- Jason Gildon, Levon Kirkland and Earl Holmes are part of a linebacking group that keeps the Steelers competitive. Back Jerome Bettis still runs hard, and the rookie receiver Plaxico Burress, who looked awfully green in the preseason, will catch on.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Quarterback. Kent Graham is the starter, Kordell Stewart the backup. It was supposed to be the other way around.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- Are the Steelers facing their third straight season without a playoff berth? Yes.</p>
        <p>6. Cleveland Browns  1999 record: 2-14  STRENGTHS -- Quarterback Tim Couch and receiver Kevin Johnson. Especially Johnson. Both players were rookies last year, but it appeared Johnson caught on at his position more quickly than Couch did. Linebacker Jamir Miller exhibits hustle and toughness.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Better pass protection needed; their quarterbacks were sacked 60 times last season, most in the conference.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- An expansion team in its second year still building.</p>
        <p>Tony Banks  Quarterback, Baltimore Ravens  They ran Tony Banks out of St. Louis, howling, two seasons ago. He landed in Baltimore, bit his lip and bided his time. He was the No. 3 quarterback entering last season and wound up the starter in the seventh game, replacing Scott Mitchell and Stoney Case. Banks won 6 of 10 starts. This is his fourth pro season. Can you believe this will be his first year in college (Michigan State) or the pros (Rams, Ravens) that he will play for the same coach in the same system for the second straight season? No wonder his development has been bumpy. Dick Vermeil, the former Rams head coach, liked Banks. Vermeil saw the raw talent, the big arm -- Banks can gun the deep ball as well as any quarterback. But though the Rams and their fans lost patience and faith in Banks, the Ravens and their fans see a future with him. A chance to shock their division first, then the conference and then the league. If Banks holds it together -- last season he threw 17 touchdown passes and only 8 interceptions -- he has a chance to be this season's Kurt Warner on this season's Rams.</p>
        <p>West</p>
        <p>1. Oakland Raiders  1999 record: 8-8  STRENGTHS -- Receiver Tim Brown, who in his 13th season runs better than some in their first; he caught 90 passes last year. Inside running from Tyrone Wheatley and breakaway running from Napoleon Kaufman. And the wondrous cornerback Charles Woodson, who this season will see action as a wide receiver, too. The new kicker, the first-round draft pick Sebastian Janikowski, is expected to make a difference, and indications are that he will.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Rich Gannon at quarterback is capable, but is he championship-caliber? The Raiders need more punch from their kickoff returns, where they averaged only 18.7 yards a return, 30th in the league.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- The Raiders should enter the playoffs for the first time in seven years.</p>
        <p>2. Denver Broncos  1999 record: 6-10  STRENGTHS -- The return of running back Terrell Davis and linebacker John Mobley. Both were injured and missed most of last season. Quarterback Brian Griese will improve from an awkward start. The offensive line, with the 12th-year guard Mark Schlereth, is active, mobile and effective. Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey are supported at receiver by the free-agent finds Andre Reed from Buffalo and Robert Brooks, out of retirement from Green Bay.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Griese's inexperience and the possible rustiness of key players returning from injuries. Watch the development of the new defensive ends Lester Archambeau from Atlanta and Kavika Pittman from Dallas.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- A playoff contender.</p>
        <p>3. Kansas City Chiefs  1999 record: 9-7  STRENGTHS -- His peers marvel at his athleticism at tight end, but Tony Gonzalez believes he has only lightly tapped his talent. Last season he caught 76 passes and 11 were touchdowns. This season he could catch 100 balls and score 20 touchdowns. The Chiefs ran the ball (521 carries) more than any other team last season. They also led the league in turnover differential (plus 21) and scored nine defensive touchdowns. They missed the playoffs in a season finale, an overtime loss at home to Oakland.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Overcoming the death of linebacker Derrick Thomas is difficult. Keeping quarterback Elvis Grbac healthy is essential.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- A teetering season.</p>
        <p>4. Seattle Seahawks  1999 record: 9-7  STRENGTHS -- The venerable running back Ricky Watters (eighth season) gains an exciting backup in the rookie Shaun Alexander from Alabama. The Seattle secondary features a supreme cover man, Shawn Springs, and a new safety, Reggie Tongue, in from Kansas City. The Seahawks led the league in interceptions last season with 30 and allowed 18.6 points a game, eighth best in the league.</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Quarterback Jon Kitna led a team that was 8-2 at the start but finished 1-5. The Seahawks won the division and a playoff berth in bizarre fashion, losing in their finale at the Jets and then watching on television in the locker room as the Chiefs lost to Oakland.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- Capable of winning the division, but, with Kitna, looks like a waffling team.</p>
        <p>5. San Diego Chargers  1999 record: 8-8  STRENGTHS -- The new receiver Curtis Conway, in from Chicago. A flexible second-year head coach in Mike Riley. An indispensable linebacker in Junior Seau. One of the league's best run-stuffing defenses (only 82.6 rushing yards allowed per game last season).</p>
        <p>WEAKNESSES -- Turning the team over to quarterback Ryan Leaf is like juggling a grenade.</p>
        <p>OUTLOOK -- Scary.</p>
        <p>PLAYER TO WATCH</p>
        <p>Sebastian Janikowski  Place-kicker, Oakland Raiders  Many people laughed when the Raiders picked Janikowski, a kicker, as the 17th pick of the draft. Bonehead move, critics offered. A team could always wait until later rounds to draft a kicker, several insisted. But look closely at the Raiders. They were 8-8. They lost two games by overtime field goals. Five of their eight losses were by an average of 1.8 points. They never lost a game by more than 7 points. They defeated four playoff teams. They were close. A kick here, a kick there. The Raiders refused to squander a chance to correct that. Enter Janikowski, as good a kicker as the college game has produced in many years. At Florida State he never missed a field goal fewer than 45 yards and half his kickoffs were too deep to return. He is a kicking weapon. Just what the Raiders needed. The little things. This one should transform the Raiders into contenders, a team that has not had a winning season since 1994.</p>
