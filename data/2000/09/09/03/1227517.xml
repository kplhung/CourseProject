        <p>THERE have not been many documented sightings of college students at 8 a.m., but hundreds of them were spotted Monday just inside the entrance to Manhattanville College here at exactly that hour. As you might expect, the occasion was a big one.</p>
        <p>Arriving on campus were the 413 freshmen members of the class of 2004. Manhattanville, like many colleges, starts freshman out in the shallow end of college life by having them come to campus before upperclassmen. This gives them time to take part in get-to-know-you exercises, placement tests and parties, creating an experience that is one part school, one part corporate retreat and one part Animal House.</p>
        <p>But it is by no means an easy day. That's because by 5 p.m., parents and students must, no matter how reluctant, say their goodbyes.</p>
        <p>Florence and Michael DeSola have already dropped four children off at college and were now doing it one last time with their youngest, Ryan. When asked to speculate about the moment of departure, Mr. DeSola smiled affectionately at his wife, then spoke with I-know-the-drill certainty.</p>
        <p>''When it's time to go, she'll hug Ryan. Tell him to behave himself. And then cry the whole ride home.'' With all the practice, has she learned anything about separation? ''I haven't,'' Mrs. DeSola said before hugging her ''baby,'' Ryan, who towers high above her.</p>
        <p>First things first, though. Between 8 and 10 a.m., clothes, bedding, posters, computers and all the other trappings of college life have to be lugged up from the cars to the rooms.</p>
        <p>From 10:45 a.m. to 3 p.m., students took writing and math placement exams, taking a break for lunch. Meanwhile, parents sat through an overview of campus life by President Richard Berman and a panel of other administrators. The floor was then opened to questions, and a forest of hands shot up. Parents are desperate for the details of their children's lives.</p>
        <p>''Is there a laundry service?'' one parent asked. Told no, that there are only machines, another parent asked a follow-up: ''Change or bills?'' An administrator answered (change), and the panel remained, thoroughly answering every last question in the room.</p>
        <p>Soon it was time for the president's dinner, the last event before goodbyes. The goodbyes, it is apparent, aren't an issue only for student and parent. Many younger siblings are in tow and looked affected, though some wouldn't admit it.</p>
        <p>Paolo Bustamante, 9, came all the way from Puerto Rico to drop off his brother Christian. Paolo, who had been sitting quietly between his brother and his mother, Olga, smiled mischievously on the subject of missing his big brother: ''I will miss his punches,'' he allowed.</p>
        <p>Danielle Terzian, 14, was there to drop off her sister, Nicole. ''It's hard,'' she said softly, on the cusp of tears. While Nicole was taking placement exams, Danielle spent the whole time setting up her room for her.</p>
        <p>Goodbyes were a jumble of hugs, whispered parting thoughts and tears.</p>
        <p>Students were then shepherded to their Precept groups. These classes are the centerpiece of the freshman year, a yearlong requirement that sets an interdisciplinary focus on Great Books in a seminar format, which also encourages discussion of college adjustment.</p>
        <p>Mary Carrarino, a Precept teacher and the vice president for student affairs, asked her students to introduce themselves and touch on what they wanted to study. Excited ambitions came tumbling out: ''I want to be a psychologist,'' one said, ''but not one sitting at a desk, talking to people on a couch, but serial killer stuff, stuff you see in the movies because it's really interesting.''</p>
        <p>By dinner, some parents were still sprinkled around the cafeteria, but most were gone and students began to converse.</p>
        <p>By 7 p.m., the freshmen were feeling a sense of themselves. They were assembled in an auditorium directly above the cafeteria to hear three administrators itemize the college's code of conduct. More in the mood to talk than listen, though (especially to rules), the group got restive. When Joe Redington the director of commuter and transfer student affairs, was parsing out the terms ''rights, responsibilities and accountabilities,'' a group of five women and one man were having a total of four conversations. ''Excuse me!'' Mr. Redington thundered, ''what I am saying is very important. It could save your life.''  This comment earned equal parts silence and snickers, but as soon as Mr. Redington touched on the subject of ''judicial sanctions'' the din went down.</p>
        <p>Next, at 8 p.m., were meetings with orientation advisers, upperclassmen who volunteer to take a group of freshmen under their wings. Jessica Benedict is a junior, and in her group the freshmen lob a volley of questions at her that nearly sucks the air out of the room. This one momentarily takes Ms. Benedict aback: ''Can we leave the campus at night? What time do we have to be back?''</p>
        <p>''There's no curfew,'' explained Ms. Benedict, after a pause and before adding kindly, ''I know, it takes a lot to get used to.''</p>
        <p>At 9:30, the final scheduled event of the day began. It was a variety show put on by the orientation advisers, which had the freshman class detonating into explosions of hoots, cheers and laughter as a parade of lip-synching rappers, a drag queen and buffoonish bubble-blowing campus security guards hit the stage.</p>
        <p>Then, about midnight, the skits ended, and the freshmen went out into a night of parties, which would soon fade into days of classes and, sooner than any could ever know, graduation.</p>
