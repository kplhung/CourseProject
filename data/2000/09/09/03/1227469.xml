        <p>ONE of the great things about having pay cable is the opportunity it provides for discovering little films that were denied theatrical release.

        <p>ONE of the great things about having pay cable is the opportunity it provides for discovering little films that were denied theatrical release. Films like the awkwardly titled ''And Then You Die,'' a hard-as-pig iron 1987 gangster drama that used to pop up on HBO well past the shank of the evening.</p>
        <p>For its first five minutes, ''Die,'' which charts the treacherous skirmishes between warring Quebec mobs, works solely in somber and gripping imagery, neatly sketching out the conflicts; it was superbly directed by Francis Mankiewicz. It's an instance where you can literally see the filmmaker running out of money and the picture eventually compromised by budgetary shortfalls, though the director's control is evident throughout.</p>
        <p>Several of the films directed by John Dahl -- including ''Red Rock West'' and ''The Last Seduction'' -- were first seen on pay cable. And unreleased pictures made by major talents are going with increasing frequency to the small screen. When ''Picking Up the Pieces,'' a movie starring Woody Allen and directed by Alfonso Arau, makes its debut on Cinemax, it's safe to say that the feature film landscape has undergone a continental shift.</p>
        <p>A flimsy comedy with a core of magical realism, ''Picking Up the Pieces'' went without distribution until it showed up earlier this year on pay cable -- though the outlet's motivation was to score a coup rather than to improve the level of its programming. But not all films having their premieres on cable can be so quickly dismissed. ''Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her,'' which made a splash on the film festival circuit this year, was swiftly acquired for theatrical distribution at the Sundance Film Festival by MGM. It has a noteworthy cast -- Cameron Diaz, Calista Flockhart, Glenn Close and Amy Brenneman -- playing women who drift in and out of one another's lives. Taking its shape from ''Short Cuts,'' Robert Altman's collaboration with Raymond Carver, ''Things'' was directed with a lighter-than-air touch by the newcomer Rodrigo Garcia. Yet MGM decided that the film could never find an audience in theaters, and it will slip into the world on Showtime in its first run, on a date yet to be announced.</p>
        <p>The cast delivers a few inspiring performances; Amy Brenneman is singular, and her work deserves a place on the big screen. The movie is certainly as good as ''Autumn in New York,'' which MGM foisted upon an unsuspecting public a few weeks ago. The problem is that despite the record number of movie screens in the United States, there are also a record number of independent films being made. And as you read about the notice some of them receive, but realize they will never appear at a local theater, it's easy to become dispirited.</p>
        <p>One such film -- which will get a berth in theaters in October but is currently showing on Cinemax -- is ''Animal Factory,'' directed by Steve Buscemi and adapted from the Edward Bunker novel of the same name. This fluky prison drama follows Ron (Edward Furlong) and his assimilation into a large state prison, where he's mentored (for lack of a better word) by the veteran inmate Earl (Willem Dafoe, whose shaved head for the role makes his sharp features look even more whittled). Despite his ropy build and no-nonsense jaw line, Earl isn't the cliched kindly-but-tough convict, nor is Ron the standard-issue fish needing to be schooled in the ways of the prison yards. And ''Animal Factory'' spares us the baroque and picturesque tortures of something like ''Oz,'' the gritty HBO prison series in which rape and assault appear so often, they should be listed in the credits. ''Factory'' follows the day-to-day dehumanization of the convicts and the tricks they invent to get through a single day. Mr. Buscemi again reveals the fluky timing and concern for the psychology of misfits that made ''Trees Lounge,'' his 1996 directorial debut, such a pleasure; ''Animal Factory'' actually plays like a novel.</p>
        <p>''Panic,'' directed by Henry Bromell, is going the way of films that will never be seen in a theater, heading straight to Cinemax. It's the story of a troubled hit man (William H. Macy) who is trained to follow his murderous father (Donald Sutherland) into the family business but who also tries to keep it from affecting the lives of his young son and his psychiatrist (John Ritter).</p>
        <p>But it's the relationship between Mr. Macy's conscience-stricken killer and Mr. Sutherland's amoral father that gives ''Panic'' a prickly dynamic. The Macy character seems rational, but his composure is only skin deep, and his attempt at order is failing him. There's the stink of moral rot coming off the character played by Mr. Sutherland, who has lately become a master at playing brusque, manipulative father figures; his turn as the coach in ''Without Limits'' ranks among the best work of his career, and his performance in ''Panic'' is on a similar level.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bromell's ability to tell a story is a bit more advanced than his directing skill at this point, but he's smart enough to stay out of the way of his narrative and not weigh it down with unnecessary stylization. He's interested in his protagonist, a guy who thinks of himself as decent until he's forced to recognize his life through the eyes of his own child. Although the claustrophobia of ''Panic'' lends itself nicely to television, it's a shame that we may never get to see how Mr. Bromell's tightening intensity might play in a theater. The dilemma offers both good news and bad: audiences will finally get to catch these pictures, but not the way the filmmakers intended.</p>
