        <p>SEVERAL months after they settled into their new home in this hamlet of Mount Pleasant, Verusha and Michael Raguso first heard the noise: a sustained, primal wail blaring from a siren mounted on a utility pole on the corner of their property.</p>
        <p>''I was in the shower and all of the sudden this blast comes out of nowhere,'' Mr. Raguso said. ''You jump out of your skin, your heart is racing and this noise is vibrating off your rib cage. I yelled, 'Oh my God! What was that?' ''</p>

        <p>SEVERAL months after they settled into their new home in this hamlet of Mount Pleasant, Verusha and Michael Raguso first heard the noise: a sustained, primal wail blaring from a siren mounted on a utility pole on the corner of their property.</p>
        <p>''I was in the shower and all of the sudden this blast comes out of nowhere,'' Mr. Raguso said. ''You jump out of your skin, your heart is racing and this noise is vibrating off your rib cage. I yelled, 'Oh my God! What was that?' ''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Raguso was not there to answer him. She had run out of the house, assuming the noise was an air raid warning.</p>
        <p>It was, in fact, a fire siren, one of five that alert the 70 volunteers of the Thornwood Fire Department to an emergency.</p>
        <p>The Ragusos say that when they bought the house, they were told the siren was no longer operational. Five months after they moved in, though, it was working again -- going off at noon each day and randomly during the day and night for emergencies.</p>
        <p>The Ragusos and some of their neighbors have mounted a campaign to dismantle the siren, arguing that it is not only an annoyance that compromises the quality of their lives but also a threat to their health. They have presented the fire commissioners in town with reports from experts in noise pollution documenting the ill effects of exposure to loud noise. Moreover, they maintain that a public siren system is archaic and that many fire departments -- both professional and volunteer -- have replaced the wailing sirens with a system of radio pagers.</p>
        <p>Firefighting officials in the hamlet are offended by the stance of the Ragusos and their neighbors. They argue that while residents may be awakened, it is the volunteers who are making the real sacrifice by getting out of bed and fighting fires to protect the community.</p>
        <p>''They're worrying about a siren and talking about being up for an hour,'' said Richard Benkwitt, a fire commissioner here. ''Well, what do you think my volunteers are doing? I can't tell you how many times I've run down my staircase with this God-awful feeling that there are people trapped in a house. They go back to sleep, and we're out there for hours fighting a fire, and I feel a little let down that they don't put up with a small inconvenience and support us in a small way.''</p>
        <p>The battle in Thornwood has been played out elsewhere in Westchester as well as in municipalities in New Jersey and Connecticut. In one particularly contentious case in New Jersey, residents were shimmying up utility poles to snip wires and get some sleep.</p>
        <p>Many fire departments in the region have moved to a radio pager system, and some use a combination of sirens and radio pagers. In Westchester there are 58 fire departments. Each fire district is autonomous and can choose its own method of alerting firefighters.</p>
        <p>All of Westchester's fire departments are outfitted with pagers, said Chief William Nardozzi, who runs the fire services division of the County Department of Emergency Services. But sirens, both the air-raid type and what is known as the blast type -- which sends a certain number of blasts as a code to identify the approximate location of the fire -- are in use in many municipalities.</p>
        <p>''The primary notification system is the radio pagers,'' Chief Nardozzi said. ''I'm sure different departments have different reasons as to why they continue to use the sirens and the horns. It's a big part of tradition, and I've seen it make a difference in terms of being a good secondary means of getting hold of people. But this is a concern throughout the county, with complaints coming in when the sirens are sounded.''</p>
        <p>In Thornwood, where the fire district covers five square miles, the sirens have been in use for more than 50 years. But, as elsewhere in the county, the hamlet has become more crowded and residents less tolerant.</p>
        <p>The Ragusos say their concerns extend beyond being jarred out of sleep. They cite research that states that repeated exposure to loud noise not only affects hearing but also induces stress-related disorders. The couple say they are so worried about the effects of the noise that they have postponed starting a family.</p>
        <p>''We were hosting our first Easter, and we had over our 1-  and 3-year-old nieces,'' Mr. Raguso said. ''They were playing on the lawn and having fun and all of the sudden this thing went off. Suddenly they are screaming hysterically, covering their ears, and the 1-year-old can't stop shaking. I said there's no way we're bringing a child in this world with this thing going off.''</p>
        <p>In response to the neighborhood complaints, the fire commissioners hired the Audiotech Digital Signal Corporation in Wurtsboro, N.Y., a manufacturer of sirens, as a consultant to evaluate the siren problem.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, that report recommended that the old siren -- which is bright yellow and looks a little like a two-story birdhouse -- be replaced by a new siren, which the company sells, described as ''the quietest mechanical outdoor warning siren on the market today.'' The report also recommended that the siren be mounted on a higher utility pole.</p>
        <p>A second study was conducted by the Thornwood fire chief, Thomas W. Chenet, to compare the effectiveness of the sirens with that of radio pagers. For eight months, the siren was disabled from 11 p.m. until 7 a.m. During the time the siren was off, the number of volunteers responding to their beepers remained relatively close to those responding to the siren. But response time was longer -- the report noted that with pagers, it took nearly an extra minute to get the first firetruck out of the station. (With the sirens working, response time between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. averaged 1.5 minutes; during the testing period it was 2.3 minutes.)</p>
        <p>The fire commissioners argue that the delay in response time could jeopardize the life of its volunteers and the community. Further, they say, there is more than safety at stake. Some consideration should also be given to the volunteers, for whom the radio beepers can be an annoyance.</p>
        <p>''If I take the beeper into my bedroom it wakes up my whole family,'' Commissioner Benkwitt said. ''It's like being a criminal, you have an electronic bracelet with you 24 hours. If I'm going out to cut the grass, and just wearing my shorts, I don't want to wear it. That's asking a lot of a volunteer that's getting no compensation.''</p>
        <p>The Ragusos are holding firm. They are collecting signatures for a petition and plan to keep fighting.</p>
        <p>''There are not enough medals to go around for our volunteers,'' Mr. Raguso said. ''They are the most wonderful people in the world to get up at 2 a.m. and fight a fire. This is nothing personal. The issue is the method by which these fine individuals are called.''</p>
