        <p>Sen Joseph I Lieberman, Vice Pres Gore's running mate, is unabashed in praise of Pres Clinton's record, unlike Gore, who has spent much of his campaign trying to distance himself from Clinton and his foibles; Lieberman, who was first Democrat in Senate to chastise Clinton for his misbehavior in Monica Lewinsky scandal, has no such need, and praises Clinton's 'extraordinary record'; photo of Gore and Lieberman (M)</p>

        <p>The candidate praises President Clinton's ''extraordinary record,'' crediting the president for the muscular economy. He tells audiences that Mr. Clinton has fought crime. He reminds people that he has been the president's friend for 30 years.</p>
        <p>These are not the words of Vice President Al Gore, who rarely mentions Mr. Clinton on the campaign trail. Mr. Gore has spent much of this campaign year trying to put distance between himself and a president whose record, foibles and outsize personality have made him a mixed blessing to his partner and political heir.</p>
        <p>No, the speaker is Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate, who was the first Democrat in the Senate to chastise Mr. Clinton for his sexual misbehavior and is sufficiently distant from Buddhist temples, Oval Office dalliances and Arkansas land deals that he does not feel the need to hold the president at arm's length. Mr. Clinton has hardly been a centerpiece of the senator's pitch, but in the weeks since his nomination, it has been clear that Mr. Lieberman feels far freer than Mr. Gore to embrace the president and claim bragging rights to the achievements of his administration.</p>
        <p>''For the last eight years, Bill Clinton and Al Gore have led a fight to get tough on violent crime,'' Mr. Lieberman said on Monday at a union rally in Chicago. Earlier in the day, he had told a gathering of religious leaders, ''I'm very proud of this extraordinary record the Clinton-Gore administration has built up.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday in Anaheim, Calif., he told the Communications Workers of America that a strong economy and investments in technology were ''the kind of change Bill Clinton and Al Gore brought to America,'' citing their ''brilliant leadership.'' And on Thursday in Portland, Ore., he said, ''There's a lot for the president to be proud of.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman often mentions Mr. Clinton by name, and even when he does not, the connection is obvious. In one of the segments of his standard stump speech that draws some of his loudest applause and cheers, he rebuts the Republicans who have called Mr. Clinton's two terms a time of squandered opportunities.</p>
        <p>''If you're one of the 22 million people who's in a job that was created in the last eight years, you sure know that the last eight years have not been squandered,'' he said today  in Portland, Me. ''If you're one of the four million new businesses in America -- two million small businesses -- that have been created in the last eight years, you know they haven't been squandered. If you are one of the millions who've gone from the dependency of welfare to the self-sufficiency of work, you know these last eight years have not been squandered. And if you're one of the other millions who have either bought a new home or refinanced the ones you have because we did turn deficits into surpluses and kept the interest rates down, you know these last eight years have not been squandered.''</p>
        <p>Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, played down what he conceded were differences in the two running mates' treatment of the president, but even in doing so, he referred to Mr. Clinton only indirectly. ''I do think the vice president acknowledges the great success of the last eight years,'' he said. ''Maybe not at every event. But what the vice president has been talking about mostly is about the future.''</p>
        <p>What to do about Mr. Clinton has posed a dilemma throughout the campaign for Mr. Gore. The vice president has been an unusually influential second-in-command to a popular president during a time of enormous prosperity, but he has had difficulty being seen, as he proclaimed himself at the Democrats' convention in Los Angeles, as ''my own man.'' And his reputation for rectitude has been shaken by the investigation of fund-raising for the 1996 campaign and by association with Mr. Clinton's private behavior.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign has frequently used current or former Clinton administration officials as surrogates in making his case to the reporters. And in Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Gore has a vehicle for boasting about his role in the administration, without doing so himself.</p>
        <p>For the Democratic faithful, at least, the praise of the president has been well received. Interviews with people at Mr. Lieberman's rallies  found that most agreed with Virginia Minarik, who said in Chicago, ''I'm glad he's not running away from Clinton like Gore is, because Clinton's been a great president.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Lieberman was effusive in his praise of Mr. Clinton. ''I feel really comfortable doing it, because President Clinton deserves it,'' he said. ''We have become the party of fiscal responsibility and economic growth,'' an achievement he attributed to ''the president and the vice president.''</p>
        <p>He was careful to distinguish Mr. Clinton's personal behavior, which he deplored so publicly in 1998, from his performance as president.</p>
        <p>What few voters realize is that in 1992, before Mr. Clinton chose Mr. Gore as his running mate, he was closer to Mr. Lieberman.</p>
        <p>In 1970, while a student at Yale law school, Mr. Clinton worked on Mr. Lieberman's first political campaign, for the state Senate, and they have kept in close touch since. They worked together in the 1980's on the Democratic Leadership Council, committed to pushing the Democratic Party toward the center, and Mr. Lieberman succeeded Mr. Clinton as head of the group.</p>
        <p>''I was the first senator outside of Arkansas to endorse him'' in 1992, Mr. Lieberman recalled. He spoke of the ''extraordinary joy'' he felt that year in watching Mr. Clinton succeed in conveying his ideas. ''And then, to have the tremendous satisfaction of seeing them work. You know, the extraordinary good times, welfare reform, crime is down. So, you know, that's a remarkable record.''</p>
