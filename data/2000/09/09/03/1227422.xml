      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Madeleine St. John has a deft touch with dense topics. In her new novel, A PURE CLEAR LIGHT (Carroll &amp; Graf, $22), St. John -- whose novel ''The Essence of the Thing'' was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1997 -- casts a wry yet unwary eye on faith and fidelity, two cornerstones of existence that are, her characters discover, as transient and conditional as they had suspected. Not long after Simon Beaufort, a television director who is married with three children, takes up with a single and sophisticated accountant named Gillian Selkirk, Simon's generous and frazzled wife, Flora, takes up with the Anglican Church. For each, a new flirtation injects some needed vitality and uncertainty into an unbalanced life. Simon's affair is grounded in the physical; Flora's in the intellectual and spiritual. His growing fear of being discovered with his lover runs in tandem with Flora's determination to uncover something meaningful from her once-lapsed faith. As the vicar at Flora's church preaches, living is not simple and exact, like arithmetic. It's more like algebra, ''with all its x's and y's and z's: with all its unknowns.'' Simon and Flora have sophisticated and funky friends, interesting children and the ability to articulate dissatisfaction and disaffectedness without sounding droll or whiny. St. John's knack for smart dialogue speeds this story effortlessly along.</p>
