        <p>Fourteen people were injured when a city bus and a minivan collided in Brooklyn yesterday afternoon, fire and transit officials said.</p>
        <p>The bus, which was traveling the B78 route through Crown Heights, collided with the minivan near Ralph Avenue and Fulton Street, said Firefighter James Spollen, a Fire Department spokesman. The accident took place shortly before 2:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Eleven people on the bus and three in the van were injured, Firefighter Spollen said. They suffered neck and shoulder injuries, were taken to three local hospitals and were in stable condition last night, Firefighter Spollen added.</p>
        <p>Fire and transit officials said they did not know any more details and were unsure what caused the accident.</p>
        <p>''As to the details, that would have to come from the police as to who was doing what traffic-wise,'' said Melissa Farley, a New York City Transit spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Police officials said they did not have any further information on the collision.</p>
