        <p>The jam band phenomenon that has its roots in old-time jazz and blues and was expanded in the 1960's lives on with the band now known as the Other Ones and their current tour, Further 2000.</p>
        <p>The Other Ones is made up of members of the Grateful Dead, minus their former leader, Jerry Garcia. Mickey Hart, Grateful Dead percussionist, and Bob Weir, a founding member of the Dead, are continuing to live the legacy of the perpetually touring band, which was based as much on community and tradition as it was on their blues derivative music.</p>

        <p>The jam band phenomenon that has its roots in old-time jazz and blues and was expanded in the 1960's lives on with the band now known as the Other Ones and their current tour, Further 2000.</p>
        <p>The Other Ones is made up of members of the Grateful Dead, minus their former leader, Jerry Garcia. Mickey Hart, Grateful Dead percussionist, and Bob Weir, a founding member of the Dead, are continuing to live the legacy of the perpetually touring band, which was based as much on community and tradition as it was on their blues derivative music.</p>
        <p>They are joined by Bruce Hornsby, Alphonso Johnson, Mark Karan and Steve Kimock. Drawing on the family theme, the tour also includes Ziggy Marley and the Melody Makers, which is made up of his brother, Stephen, and sisters, Cedella and Sharon, all of whom are carrying on the musical tradition of their father, Bob Marley.</p>
        <p>Further 2000 will visit the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford next Sunday and at the Sony Entertainment Center in Camden Sept. 16.</p>
