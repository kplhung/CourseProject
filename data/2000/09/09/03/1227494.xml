        <p>To the Editor: My husband, our two sons and I were in Paris several months ago and encountered a problem I had never had when I traveled just with my husband. Most drivers refused to take four passengers, even though there is a surcharge for the fourth. They apparently are not required to do so, although the cars have enough room.</p>
        <p>A few drivers did pick us up, and the Metro was excellent, inexpensive and easy to use. Sometimes you need a taxi, however, and I want to make other travelers aware of this problem.</p>
        <p>MIRIAM J. HAINES  New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Marion Fourestier, a spokeswoman for the French Government Tourist Office in New York, responds: Our Paris office confirms that Paris taxis are not obliged to take more than three adult passengers (two children under 10 count as an adult), and that they are very strict about it. The primary reason is security: in many cars, the fourth passenger would have to sit next to the driver. Drivers of larger cars, which have more room in the back, usually accept a fourth person, the surcharge being 13 francs ($1.80).</p>
