        <p>Now that many schools are back in session, a pop quiz seems in order. Who is going to win the presidential election? Just kidding. The real question is, what will the stock market do leading up to the election?</p>
        <p>Pencils down. Don't feel sheepish if you guessed that it would fall.</p>
        <p>Historically, it is true that September and October are two of the worst-performing months for stocks. But John Garrity, associate research director at Investec Ernst &amp; Company, has uncovered an interesting fact that may suggest a run-up before Election Day.</p>
        <p>In only two of the last nine election years - 1972 and 1984 - was there a negative return on Wall Street in the two months before the election, he pointed out. And in each of those two elections the incumbent won, which cannot happen this year. That in and of itself is positive, Mr. Garrity said.</p>
        <p>Investors, meanwhile, are relishing an end-of-the-summer romp on Wall Street. For the first time in two and a half years, all three major gauges recorded five consecutive weeks of gains. Last week, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 1 percent, the Nasdaq composite jumped nearly 5 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average was up slightly.</p>
