        <p>Not since Fox snared CBS's former National Football League television heirloom in 1993 has a change in the sport's broadcast landscape provoked as much curiosity as Dennis Miller's hiring on ABC's ''Monday Night Football.''</p>
        <p>''I'm an odd, quirky choice,'' he told a group of writers last week by telephone. ''It gives you something to write about. If I don't work out, you'll be like wildebeests on the Serengeti. It'll be your fall feeding feast.''</p>

        <p>Not since Fox snared CBS's former National Football League television heirloom in 1993 has a change in the sport's broadcast landscape provoked as much curiosity as Dennis Miller's hiring on ABC's ''Monday Night Football.''</p>
        <p>''I'm an odd, quirky choice,'' he told a group of writers last week by telephone. ''It gives you something to write about. If I don't work out, you'll be like wildebeests on the Serengeti. It'll be your fall feeding feast.''</p>
        <p>Miller said he had learned several lessons during three preseason games with Al Michaels and Dan Fouts: to speak less frequently and to bring fewer scripted remarks into the booth.</p>
        <p>''I think I'll dial it back 15 to 20 percent, but I don't question myself for overtalking during the first three games,'' Miller said. ''To define perimeters you have to go out and find the fence line.''</p>
        <p>No doubt, Miller has shown he belongs: his humor has hit its mark more than it has missed, and he knows enough football to know what he doesn't know; when he's underinformed, he asks Fouts to define the more complex terminology.</p>
        <p>Now that the games will count, Miller's ability to integrate his humor and insights will be tested. The producer, Don Ohlmeyer, won't let Miller overwhelm any game, much less a tight one, and Miller has no desire to be overwhelming.</p>
        <p>But, Ohlmeyer said, ''Some people would prefer we do downs and yardage and nothing else.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''We're not trying to irritate people but we won't please everybody. I hope people will continue to watch, but if they don't, there isn't much we can do about it.''</p>
        <p>The three low-rated preseason games aren't likely to serve as a referendum on the ''M.N.F.'' team. Two games started at 7 p.m., one at 8. The preseason schedule, Ohlmeyer said, was a ''real disservice.''</p>
        <p>If Fouts has been affected by being ignored amid the Miller Mania, he doesn't show it. The focus on Miller has given Fouts a virtual free pass on widespread public judgment. But once tomorrow night's game begins, he will be pressured to deliver more insights than he ever has before.</p>
        <p>''It's the game that matters,'' Fouts said. ''People tune in to watch football. With Dennis's ability to chime in and give a different slant, that's the mix we're looking for.''</p>
        <p>Fox's John Madden is a bit perplexed by the need for Miller at ABC.</p>
        <p>''If he's going to be an analyst, that's fine,'' he said. ''But I have a problem with needing to be entertained. If that's true, if football isn't exciting enough where we need to be entertained, then we've really overpaid.''</p>
        <p>Madden is the last person to argue against an analyst's being entertaining. His whole success has been in making football analysis fun.</p>
        <p>(Incidentally, in this third year of the networks' N.F.L. deals, ABC and ESPN are paying a combined $1.05 billion, CBS $500 million, Fox $450 million. None of them say they are paying too much.)</p>
        <p>At CBS, the biggest change is to move its studio from indoors at West 57th Street to outside the General Motors Building at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue, where fans behind velvet ropes can scream at Jerry Glanville and Mike Ditka.</p>
        <p>CBS was swayed to make the change by the interaction of network morning show hosts and fans when they stray outside.</p>
        <p>''I think it will pay off in a show that's a lot more fun to watch and get people to talk about the show,'' said Sean McManus, the president of CBS Sports. ''My hope is that in a couple of years, we won't be able to imagine not doing it outside with an audience. The vitality is more than you'd get inside.''</p>
        <p>The addition of Ditka to the quartet of Glanville, Jim Nantz, Craig James and Randy Cross is one of two high-profile personnel moves at CBS.</p>
        <p>The other is the signing of Dick Enberg to team with Dan Dierdorf.</p>
        <p>Two seasons without football at NBC were more than Enberg could bear.</p>
        <p>''I missed it more than I ever would have imagined,'' Enberg said.</p>
        <p>Ditka's best year of three in a similar, albeit indoor, role at NBC's studio show was his last, before his misguided return to coaching with the New Orleans Saints. ''The first year, I didn't want to say much,'' Ditka said.</p>
        <p>By the third year, his chemistry with Joe Gibbs made Ditka more provocative and opinionated. Will he be risk averse in his rookie year at CBS?</p>
        <p>''I don't think so,'' he said emphatically.</p>
        <p>Steve Young In, Michael Irvin Out</p>
        <p>Fox has made no major changes in its Sunday game and studio rosters, while ESPN yesterday said that the former 49er quarterback Steve Young will appear periodically on ''Sunday N.F.L. Countdown.'' Fox Sports Net's ''N.F.L. This Morning'' had hired Michael Irvin, the former Cowboy, but fired him even after marijuana possession charges were dropped. Adding the inexperienced and arrogant Irvin was risky and unneeded in light of the chemistry of the show's cast.</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. has made two noticeable changes. First, umpires will wear tiny cameras on their caps, providing a turf-level view. ''When the umpire was feeling good,'' said CBS's Phil Simms, ''we got shots of players' feet. But as he got tired and started standing up straight, we got better shots.''</p>
        <p>Second, the league will allow more than two Sunday games into markets when home games are played. So, Fox or CBS can program one of its doubleheader games into a market if the home game sells out 72 hours before kickoff and if the second broadcast does not compete with the home game.</p>
