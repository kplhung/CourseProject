        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''O, to Be Single and Have a Politician Pay Attention'' (Week in Review, Aug. 27): I am glad that someone has finally pointed out that unmarried, childless voters are invisible to politicians of all stripes. As one of the millions of single, childless people in the New York metropolitan area, I resent the current campaign focus on ''working families,'' a phrase that conjures up for me a picture of a mother and father with one or more children, all on the job.</p>

        <p>Even with countless tax cuts, I owe taxes at the end of the year. Despite strong family and community ties, I am constantly reminded that only mothers feel the pain of gun violence. In November, I will vote, but I will lament that my vote and campaign support have again been taken for granted and that the concerns of my demographic bloc will be ignored for four more years.</p>
