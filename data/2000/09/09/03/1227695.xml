        <p>The sprawl of outdoor advertising has prompted a new citywide zoning effort.</p>
        <p>This month, the City Planning Commission proposed new rules that would limit billboards in large pockets of the city that are unregulated, including parts of Lower Manhattan and the waterfront.</p>
        <p>The proposal would extend the restrictions that exist in major commercial areas to manufacturing districts, like SoHo and TriBeCa. Among other things, billboards would be limited to 750 square feet and could be no higher than 58 feet. Many signs in unregulated areas now exceed 1,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Illuminated signs would be banned on all piers and restricted along waterfront blocks. New curbs would apply to signs near parks and major highways.</p>
        <p>''There has been a proliferation of billboards throughout the city,'' said Joseph B. Rose, the commission's chairman. ''Some are trying to take advantage of loopholes, some are simply illegal and some we haven't seen before.''</p>
        <p>The effort is prompted by technology that allows larger and bolder advertisements to be printed on flexible vinyl. The regulations are the first of several aimed at billboards that the city will announce soon, Mr. Rose said.</p>
        <p>Billboard opponents embraced the proposed rules as a step in the right direction, but said they fell short on enforcement.</p>
        <p>''It needs to have teeth to work,'' said Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, a vocal billboard critic who represents Lower Manhattan. ''Until we have that, it won't make a difference how good the regulations are.''</p>
        <p>Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, said any new rules must also specify stiff penalties. Otherwise, companies would simply treat the fines, about $500 under current practice, as a cost of doing business, he said.</p>
        <p>Some officials of billboard companies agree with the criticisms.</p>
        <p>''Why change the existing rules when the current ones aren't being enforced?'' asked Richard Schaps, president of Van Wagoner, a major billboard company.</p>
        <p>Billboard critics also assert that the proposals, which come more than two years after the City Council first grappled with the issue, may be too little, too late.</p>
        <p>During that time, they say, billboard companies have erected hundreds of free-standing advertising structures throughout the city. Under the proposed rules, those structures would be exempt.</p>
        <p>''Every square inch of building and sky that could have one of these billboards practically does,'' Councilwoman Christine Quinn said. ''If this happened earlier, we might have actually preserved some open space.''</p>
        <p>The proposal now moves to the local community boards as part of the city's Uniform Land Use Review Process.</p>
        <p>''It's at the beginning of a fairly lengthy process,'' said Jordan Barowitz, a spokesman for Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone.</p>
