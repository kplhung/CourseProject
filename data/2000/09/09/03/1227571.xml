        <p>TO her teachers at Nelson Mandela High School here, Rasheda J. Farmer was a good student and a lively presence in class. A pretty 17-year-old with smiling eyes and elegantly braided hair, she was intelligent and polite and seemed likely to do well after graduation.</p>
        <p>They were shocked, therefore, when they heard last week that Ms. Farmer had been charged with helping to commit one of the most senseless murders this city has seen in years.</p>
        <p>''How could a girl like her get caught up in something like this?'' said Dr. Hosea Zollicoffer, the principal at Mandela. ''It keeps you from sleeping at night. You just don't know what to do.''</p>
        <p>A tall man with a gentle, grandfatherly manner, Dr. Zollicoffer sighed and looked down at the newspaper articles on his desk, which outlined the bare facts. Ms. Farmer, who would have been a senior this fall, had been arrested with a 19-year-old Poughkeepsie man named Raul South in the robbery and murder of Devon Clarke, a local 22-year-old who was just a few months from his college graduation. The police said Ms. Farmer and Mr. South had killed Mr. Clarke for $400 and some jewelry. Both were charged with second-degree murder.</p>
        <p>Unlike many of the killings in Mount Vernon in recent years, this one had nothing to do with turf wars, feuds or rivalries. Mr. Clarke scarcely knew Ms. Farmer, whom he had arranged to meet for drinks on a Saturday night at the suggestion of a friend. In a statement to the police, Mr. South said that he and Ms. Farmer had set out to rob Mr. Clarke.</p>
        <p>The murder has stunned the city, Dr. Zollicoffer said, not only because of its coldbloodedness but also because many in the community knew both Ms. Farmer and Mr. Clarke. Although Ms. Farmer had had difficulties, including an incident in eighth grade when she cut another child with a razor, several people said they could not understand how she could have been party to a murder. And all of them seem amazed that the victim should have been Mr. Clarke, a thoughtful young man who was majoring in business and marketing at Clark Atlanta University and planned to work in real estate like his uncle in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''That family doesn't deserve this,'' said Lillian Lucas-Dixon, a neighbor of the Clarkes. ''They're well known, well respected and loved in the community.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clarke was only home from Atlanta because he had wanted to accompany his mother on the 12-hour drive from South Carolina, where she had dropped her daughter Keisha off at college. He was planning to return to Atlanta on Monday, the day after he was killed.</p>
        <p>The Clarke family learned of their son's death on a Sunday morning, after a friend of the family discovered his body in the family's white 1996 Volvo station wagon on South 11th Avenue. The friend had first seen the car while walking to church, and she had thought it odd that the windshield wipers were on even though it was not raining. Returning from church an hour later, she saw that the wipers were still on and decided to take a closer look. She found Mr. Clarke in the driver's seat with a hole in the back of his head.</p>
        <p>Ever since, a constant stream of visitors has moved in and out of Glenston and Wendie Clarke's beige two-story house in the Kingsbridge Gardens section of Mount Vernon, bearing flowers and trays of food. Mr. Clarke, a groundskeeper for the Mount Vernon public schools, and his wife, a registered nurse, are both active members of the P.T.A. Mr. Clarke was the first president of the Mount Vernon Police Community Council when it was formed in 1995.</p>
        <p>''Devon was a beam and light to the community,'' said Mr. Clarke, 63, who has a broad gray beard and large somber eyes. ''Even to our co-workers, everybody knows Devon.'' Like his father, Devon volunteered his time, working with children at Abbott House, a home for dependent and abused children in Irvington.</p>
        <p>In the photographs gathered by his family and displayed on a cork board in their home, Devon is a tall, handsome young man with his father's dark eyes. He played basketball and baseball in college, and in some photographs he appears shirtless, displaying a spectacularly muscled physique.</p>
        <p>''He matured a lot,'' said Micah Lewis, a friend from Minneapolis, of the time they spent together at college in Atlanta. ''He didn't have to prove anything to anyone.''</p>
        <p>On Aug. 24, hundreds of friends of the Clarke family turned out in search of answers at the City Court on a hot muggy afternoon. Most were turned away at the doors, because the courtroom had room for only 90. Inside, Judge Brenda Dowery-Rodriguez warned the restless audience to be quiet as Mr. South and Ms. Farmer were led in and took places at the defendants' table.</p>
        <p>Detective Arthur Glover then recounted what he had been told by Mr. South, who was on probation from a drug conviction at the time and has a long arrest record in Poughkeepsie and Newburgh for drug sales, larceny, resisting arrest and assault. His father and stepfather are currently serving 25 years to life in prison for a robbery and murder they committed together in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. South said he had come to Mount Vernon on Saturday afternoon because he needed someone to rob. He said that Ms. Farmer suggested that they rob Mr. Clarke, who had called her earlier in the day, ''as long as you don't hurt him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. South's comment would suggest that Ms. Farmer did not expect the robbery to turn violent. But Capt. Robert Kelly, the detective in charge of the case, did not support that view. ''She is in the company of someone who got killed, and is then found walking around with the person who did it,'' he said. ''It does not lend a favorable view to what preceded the incident.''</p>
        <p>Mr. South said that when Mr. Clarke joined them, Mr. Clarke was carrying a 9-millimeter handgun and loaded a bullet into it, a claim that the police would neither confirm nor deny.</p>
        <p>The three of them then went to Sue's Rendezvous, a topless bar on Gramatan Avenue, and drank Champagne. They then drove to Hunts Point in the Bronx, he said, and bought marijuana, returning to the far end of South 11th Avenue to smoke it.</p>
        <p>But instead, Mr. South, who was sitting in the back seat, shot Mr. Clarke in the back of the head, he told the police. Mr. South and Ms. Farmer then went to Ms. Farmer's grandmother's house, Mr. South said, where they dropped off their bloodstained clothing, and then went to Ms. Farmer's house, where they left the murder weapon.</p>
        <p>The next day, the police found the suspects with the help of people who had seen them with Mr. Clarke the night before, Captain Kelly said. They searched Ms. Farmer's apartment at 300 Gramatan Avenue and found four weapons: two 9 millimeter handguns, one .38-caliber handgun and a sawed-off shotgun. It is not clear where the weapons came from, but one of them has been determined to be the murder weapon, Captain Kelly said.</p>
        <p>The hearing left many other questions unanswered. No one knows whether Mr. South and Ms. Farmer had plotted to kill Mr. Clarke. It is not clear why Mr. Clarke agreed to join them or whether he owned a gun. The case has been referred to a county grand jury.</p>
        <p>Friends of the Clarke family said they were certain that Mr. Clarke would not have risked his life resisting a robbery.</p>
        <p>''He would never have died over money,'' Micah Lewis said. ''He would give you the last money he had in his pocket. Because it's not important to him. He didn't have much, being in college and everything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clarke's sister Keisha said someone had robbed his car last year, and she had asked whether he was going to retaliate. He told her he didn't need to do that, she said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the greatest mystery, however, is what drove Ms. Farmer to become part of such a crime. ''What could have happened to a 17-year-old girl?'' said Myrna Merchant, a friend of the Clarke family, as she stood on the courthouse steps after the hearing. ''She must have lost her soul along the way. What does it say about us as a race, as a people, as parents, as a community?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Farmer's mother, Denise Farmer, interviewed in her sister's living room in Mount Vernon, would not comment on her daughter's role in the crime. She described her as a happy, outgoing child whose self-confidence and good looks sometimes brought her into conflict with other girls.</p>
        <p>''You cannot follow your children around, you can only hope and pray that your teaching follows them every day,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Rasheda had been in trouble once before, her mother said, when she slashed a child with a razor in eighth grade, an incident that has marked her life ever since. Ms. Farmer said that her daughter had acted in self-defense, and that she had been attacked by a group of girls the day before the incident, leaving her with a scar on her chest. She was a student at Davis Middle School at the time.</p>
        <p>''I had gone up to the school on numerous occasions and said the parents have to get together because there's a problem and I'm afraid for my daughter's life,'' Ms. Farmer said. The family also notified the police, said Howard Farmer, Rasheda's father, who is divorced from Ms. Farmer.</p>
        <p>The matter was settled in family court, and Rasheda received probation. But it gave her a reputation, and other children continued to taunt and threaten her long afterward, her parents said.</p>
        <p>Fearing for her daughter's safety, Ms. Farmer picked her up at the supermarket where Rasheda worked at the end of her shift that summer. And she sent her to the Mandela school the next year, where she thought she would be safer than at Mount Vernon High.</p>
        <p>Ms. Farmer also said that although her daughter has worked since she was 14 as a cashier at C-Town, A.&amp;P. and Old Navy, she was not working this summer, aside from some baby-sitting. She would not say why. She said Rasheda had gotten to know Mr. South through an aunt who lives in Poughkeepsie.</p>
        <p>At the Mandela school, questions about Rasheda hung unanswered in the air as a parade of students walked silently in and out of Dr. Zollicoffer's hot, windowless office. Almost all of the students denied knowing anything about her, even though Mandela has only 175 students in grades 9 through 12. The school is intended for students who have had academic or behavioral problems at Mount Vernon High School, and it offers smaller classes and more intensive supervision.</p>
        <p>''They don't want to talk about her, because they know her,'' said Dr. Zollicoffer. ''They know what kind of person she was, what kind of person she grew into. And they all know someone who is in her predicament.''</p>
        <p>To her teachers, Rasheda was a bright, promising girl. ''She was one of the best students I had,'' said Anthony Verzillo, who taught her global history last year. She did her homework diligently and always participated during the 75-minute classes, maintaining a B to B-plus average. ''She always acted like a lady in my class. She was always appropriately dressed, always respectful. Some students don't say hello to you outside of class, but she always did,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Rasheda had another side, according to two Mandela staff members. She had had serious disciplinary problems in earlier years, refusing to come to school once for two weeks, and she used drugs, they said.</p>
        <p>''God, I loved that girl,'' said one teacher who talked with her often, and added that she was worried that Rasheda would get into serious trouble. ''She was just a kid with adult problems.''</p>
        <p>''She would work in spurts,'' said Dr. Zollicoffer. ''She'd be outstanding, and then drop out.''</p>
        <p>One former classmate of Rasheda's, who said she had known her since they were both toddlers, said Rasheda's problems stemmed from violence and drug abuse in her own family.</p>
        <p>The classmate, who is also a good friend of Mr. Clarke and his family, said Rasheda had turned to robbery to feed her appetite for jewelry and was spending time with a dangerous crowd. ''Rasheda had become ghetto,'' she said, ''cursing, fighting, acting like boys.''</p>
        <p>''People like that, they see other people with jewelry and stuff, they have to find a fast way to get these things,'' she said. But she shook her head in wonder at the thought that her former friend could have been involved in a murder.</p>
        <p>And when she spoke of Mr. Clarke, her eyes filled with tears.</p>
        <p>''Why they have to do that to my boy? We used to see him and start cracking up before he even came into the room, we just knew he was going to say something funny. It's just his face, you know?''</p>
        <p>Hundreds of people attended Mr. Clarke's wake, held at the Church of the Ascension in Mount Vernon. The church was packed for several hours, and the crowd spilled over into the streets until after 9 p.m.</p>
        <p>''Just as I am grieving for him as a mother, I grieve for the mothers of those two children, because I know they must be grieving for such horrendous things they have done,'' said Mrs. Clarke, as she sat near the line of friends and well-wishers waiting to view her son's body in its open coffin.</p>
        <p>''Devon would have wanted us to mobilize so this tragedy will not happen to any other community,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But that, Mayor Ernest D. Davis said, is more easily said than done. Three young men have been murdered in Mount Vernon in the past year.</p>
        <p>''There's always an outpouring, but it doesn't last, it doesn't penetrate,'' he said. ''It seems like the lessons are not learned. We have to be outraged for more than a day. We need a communal response. Allegedly someone took a life for light and transient reasons. We have people that are hardened to that extent.''</p>
        <p>A School That's Theirs: 'It's Right in the Hood'</p>
        <p>ON the outside, the Nelson R. Mandela Community Alternative High School, where Rasheda J. Farmer would have been a senior this fall, does not look inviting. A yellow three-story building on South 11th Avenue in one of the more dangerous areas of Mount Vernon, it resembles a crumbling prison more than a school.</p>
        <p>The inside is not encouraging either. The school, which was created for troubled students who have struggled at Mount Vernon High School, lacks a library, a gym, a cafeteria and a computer room.</p>
        <p>But even critics concede that the dedication of its teachers helps make up for those defects.</p>
        <p>''The people in the building show those children unconditional love and respect,'' said Schools Superintendent Ronald O. Ross, who tried to close the school last year because of its physical shortcomings. The move provoked a protest from parents, many of whom view Mandela as the last hope for their children.</p>
        <p>Sylvia Tyree, the president of the Mandela P.T.A., said: ''If it had not been for that school I don't think my son would have gotten his diploma. Some children do better in a smaller, home-type environment.''</p>
        <p>Enrollment is 175, and classes average about 20 students -- far smaller than at Mount Vernon High, which has 2,700 students. Several churches work with the school, and there are frequent visits from Mayor Ernest D. Davis and probation and police officers.</p>
        <p>''I try to work with the kids, to get their lives into a productive direction,'' said Judge Sam D. Walker of the Mount Vernon City Court. Often, Judge Walker said, he will release Mandela teenagers who have been arrested for a misdemeanor, on the condition that they attend school and are not disruptive in class.</p>
        <p>''It's right in the hood, that's what makes it work,'' said the principal, Dr. Hosea Zollicoffer, in his office, where the walls are covered with posters of Malcolm X, Nelson Mandela, Louis Farrakhan and other black leaders. The school's student body is 98 percent African-American. ''People see this school as theirs. It's a family atmosphere, where people care about one another.''</p>
        <p>The school faces formidable challenges. Seventy-five percent of the students qualify for free lunch, and the school's brochure frankly states that many come from single-parent families with histories of violence and drug abuse.</p>
        <p>Those forces cannot always be countered by caring teachers, Dr. Zollicoffer said. Three former Mandela students were murdered this year alone, and Rasheda Farmer has been charged with robbery and murder.</p>
        <p>But the school has also had its share of success. Seventy-five percent of its graduates attend college, Dr. Zollicoffer said. Many local people did not expect Mandela, which was first conceived in 1987 as the Academy for Disruptive Students, to last this long.</p>
        <p>And Mandela's prospects appear to be good. Mount Vernon passed a $100 million bond act in April, which included funds for overhauling the school's physical plant and giving it the facilities it lacks.</p>
