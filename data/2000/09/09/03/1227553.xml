        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I greatly enjoyed Anthony Tommasini's article on Pierre Boulez in Salzburg [''In Salzburg, a Benevolent Elder,'' Aug. 27]. I was struck by his report of a recent Boulez performance of ''Petrouchka'' because it was virtually identical to my experience almost 30 years earler. Mr. Boulez was conducting the BBC Symphony in the work and I was utterly astonished and thrilled to find myself suddenly distinguishing between first and second flute, first and second oboe, etc., no matter how complex the scoring of a passage. That is how I put it to friends; Mr. Tommasini speaks more eloquently of ''intricate inner voices and layered happenings'' he hadn't known were there.</p>

        <p>I became an instant Boulez idolater and promptly subscribed to the New York Philharmonic, to start in the fall of 1972. It was a 75-mile drive to Avery Fisher Hall from Vassar, where I was then teaching. The concerts were exciting; the hall was seldom filled. It is good to see that as Mr. Boulez has become mellower, concert audiences have become more perceptive.</p>
