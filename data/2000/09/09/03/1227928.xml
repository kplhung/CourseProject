        <p>YOU can credit supportive parents or rail against impious youth, but Seth MacFarlane is to brashly irreverent what Marge Simpson is to high hair.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacFarlane, the 26-year-old creator and executive producer of ''Family Guy,'' Fox's sensibility-tweaking animated series (Tuesdays at 9 p.m.), also does the voices of three of the show's characters. He is Peter Griffin, the tubby patriarch; Brian, the martini-swilling talking dog; and Stewie, the evil scientist toddler, who looks like Peter Lorre and sounds like a cranky Rex Harrison. The amiably dysfunctional family also includes Peter's accommodating wife, Lois; anxiety-ridden 16-year-old Meg; and her 13-year-old simpleton of a brother, Chris. This is a show in which a wheelchaired geezer watching snippets of pornography, which have replaced the ''dull parts'' of the Griffins' wedding video, punches his groin, shouting, ''Wake up!''</p>

        <p>YOU can credit supportive parents or rail against impious youth, but Seth MacFarlane is to brashly irreverent what Marge Simpson is to high hair.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacFarlane, the 26-year-old creator and executive producer of ''Family Guy,'' Fox's sensibility-tweaking animated series (Tuesdays at 9 p.m.), also does the voices of three of the show's characters. He is Peter Griffin, the tubby patriarch; Brian, the martini-swilling talking dog; and Stewie, the evil scientist toddler, who looks like Peter Lorre and sounds like a cranky Rex Harrison. The amiably dysfunctional family also includes Peter's accommodating wife, Lois; anxiety-ridden 16-year-old Meg; and her 13-year-old simpleton of a brother, Chris. This is a show in which a wheelchaired geezer watching snippets of pornography, which have replaced the ''dull parts'' of the Griffins' wedding video, punches his groin, shouting, ''Wake up!''</p>
        <p>''If somebody pitches a joke in the writers' room and we all are just on the floor laughing and it's off-color, we'll put it in,'' Mr. MacFarlane says. ''We're certainly not prudes. That's really the only way you can gauge what's funny -- if we laugh, maybe someone else will.''</p>
        <p>Mr. MacFarlane, who grew up in Kent, Conn., thanks his ''ex-hippie'' parents for raising his blush threshold. ''My parents laugh at the show. It's their sense of humor too,'' Mr. MacFarlane said. ''We were a very close family. We all had filthy minds, every one of us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. MacFarlane's parents apparently had supportive attitudes too. In the seventh grade their son became fascinated by animation after watching the Nickelodeon show ''Lights, Camera, Action,'' so they researched animation techniques and bought him a secondhand eight-millimeter movie camera so he could bring his drawings to life. Seth promptly created a cartoon called ''Space Pirates'' for a school project.</p>
        <p>''I really didn't know what I was doing,'' Mr. MacFarlane recalled. ''I was shooting every movement on 12 frames when I should have been shooting it on 1 or 2. As a result, it moved very, very slowly.''</p>
        <p>By the time he began studying at the Rhode Island School of Design, he had become more adept. Fooling around locally as a stand-up comedian had bolstered his confidence, he said, and taught him how far he could or couldn't go with a joke. The school's animation department sent his work to Hanna-Barbera, and the company hired him right after graduation, in 1995. The student project that impressed them was a short called ''Larry and Steve,'' which he had developed with the Cartoon Network in mind.</p>
        <p>Mr. MacFarlane did script writing work for both Hanna-Barbera and Disney before being asked to do four shorts about the Griffins for ''Mad TV.'' The sketches were to be featured within the show just as ''The Simpsons'' had begun as shorts on ''The Tracey Ullman Show.'' That deal fell through, but Fox executives laughed so hard at the eight minutes that Mr. MacFarlane had created that the ''Family Guy'' characters ended up skipping the hors d'oeuvre route and going straight into their own series.</p>
        <p>In fact, ''Family Guy'' was promoted by Fox as the next big thing. Mr. MacFarlane was handed a three-year $2 million-plus contract before his 25th birthday. And the series premiere was given the world's most desirable time slot: right after the 1999 Super Bowl. A year and a half later, ''Family Guy'' has not become the runaway hit that Fox might have hoped for, but its ratings have been respectable (an average of 6.3 million viewers weekly, just a million or so fewer than ''Futurama''). And it's not going anywhere. The series, which ends its second season on Sept. 12 has been given the go-ahead for another 13 episodes, to be shown next summer. ''Fox has never really tried to change what the show is,'' Mr. MacFarlane said. ''They've never said: 'O.K., well, you had your fun. Now it's time to do ''The Waltons.'' ' ''</p>
