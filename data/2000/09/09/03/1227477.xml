        <p>EARLY in the fall of 1962, when Bernard Olshan was about to move into the Amalgamated Houses in the Bronx with his new bride, he called on an amateur violinist named Herman Leibman. A gangly fellow with a Yiddish accent and a graying cloud of hair that brought to mind Einstein's, Leibman was for lack of a more exact term the culture minister of the complex, which had been built by a garment workers union largely for its rank and file. Mr. Olshan, a painter, wanted to see about renting a studio.</p>
        <p>Not long after the meeting, having satisfied himself with Mr. Olshan's record of museum exhibits and gallery shows, Leibman led the artist to a ground-floor doorway. Behind it lay three small rooms threaded with steam pipes and electric wires, the kind of warren that would have stored rock salt or caulk guns in a conventional apartment house. Leibman had swept the cement floor, painted the cinderblock walls, even barred the lone window against intruders, and now he was offering it to Mr. Olshan as a studio for $40 a year. In return, he asked simply that the painter give lessons to the housing development's children.</p>
        <p>Sixteen years later, Mr. Olshan's own child, Aaron, took his turn approaching Leibman. He was 18, heading into the School of Visual Arts, and eager to have someplace to paint other than in his bedroom. Leibman visited the Olshan apartment one evening, cast his gaze at the violet and cobalt-blue hues of a recent landscape of Aaron's, and pronounced: ''The sky is painted very professionally. You'll have a studio.''</p>
        <p>The Olshans, father and son, continue to live and paint in the Amalgamated Houses. Even as they move in professional circles well afield -- Bernard as a member of the National Academy of Design, Aaron among the mainstays of the downtown scene -- they take brush to canvas in a neighborhood where one avenue bears the name of the labor titan Sidney Hillman. In so doing, the Olshans embody New York's enduring commitment to stimulating artistic and intellectual activity where working people dwell.</p>
        <p>Whether in the complexes built by labor unions, radical fellowships or the city's Housing Authority, New York -- uniquely among American cities -- has for more than 80 years insisted upon culture as a part of the social compact, something as essential to the working class as affordable rent and medical care. To this day, even with left-wing ideology in retreat, the welfare state discredited, New York's working-class altered by racial and ethnic change  and the entire notion of art's elevating role attacked as elitist, the compact persists in its unfashionable audacity. Decades after mandolin ensembles and W.P.A. murals typified the phenomenon, it carries on through such disparate ventures as opera in the Amalgamated Houses, ethics classes in the Penn South development in Manhattan and a symphony orchestra and youth chorus devoted to performing for residents of public-housing projects. Such ventures have proved essential to New York's prominence as a cultural capital, while remaining oddly invisible -- because few New Yorkers realize the vast extent of union developments or recognize that public housing here defies the stereotype of fetid, crime-ridden projects.</p>
        <p>''There's no work without a place to work,'' Aaron Olshan put it recently as he paced the paint-spattered floor of his studio. ''This was the first validation I got as a professional artist. It's made it possible for me to be a full-time artist. It's let me pursue my passion. And it's meant that I have a strong connection with this neighborhood, a strong love of this neighborhood. I hope that I've given something back. Because a community needs its artists, its intellectuals. They raise the community to a higher level.''</p>
        <p>In his personal way, Aaron Olshan was expressing the appreciation of high culture's transformative power that has long informed New York's social compact. ''The tradition has always expressed a connection between labor and culture,'' said Daniel Soyer, a professor at Fordham University who specializes in Jewish history in New York. ''There was an idea that the liberation of workers depended in great degree on raising their status, on raising their image of themselves, on raising their horizons. The more they would understand the world, the more they would act on it.''</p>
        <p>These ideas may have flourished in New York as nowhere else in the United States, but they had their origins in the social ferment of Europe as the Enlightenment and its rationalist ideals gave way to 20th-century modernism, and they were largely carried across the Atlantic by millions of Jewish immigrants. Modernity brought Jews political emancipation in Western Europe and revolutionary ideology in the czarist empire, and in both the urban ghetto and the rural shtetl, secular culture was embraced as a means of liberation. Jewish radicals schooled themselves in Russian literature; the Yiddish cultural movement represented a deliberate effort to forge world-class art out of folk material.</p>
        <p>IN Germany and Austria, Jewish aspiration encountered a high-brow kind of democratic socialism, and during the interwar years both nations developed cultural programs that directly anticipated the social compact in New York. Germany had begun setting up workers' schools and the Volksbuhne, or People's Theater, as early as the 1890's. When the 1918 revolution brought a socialist government to power, the individual German states assumed control over royal theaters and opera companies, seeking somehow to balance a belief in unfettered artistic expression with a commitment to elevating the masses through fine art.</p>
        <p>That same year, Viennese voters seated a socialist government, beginning a 16-year period when the city would be known as ''Red Vienna.'' There, even more than in Weimar Germany, the government embedded cultural activity ranging from concerts to gymnastics to reading circles within public housing. ''High culture was considered to be a critical part of workers' patrimony,'' said Pieter Judson, an associate professor of history at Swarthmore College. ''There was a strong belief in self-education in the broadest sense.''</p>
        <p>These experiments affected New York in both direct and indirect ways. Czarist repression ultimately drove several million Eastern European Jews to America, taking with them Yiddish culture and radical politics. The fascist takeovers in Germany and Austria in the mid-1930's, which specifically aimed at the ''Bolshevist decadence'' of socialist culture, sent a smaller but still influential stream of refugees into the United States.</p>
        <p>For a multitude of reasons, New York offered the best prospect of recreating something similar to ''Red Vienna'' on American soil. ''You had these overlapping layers of ethnicity, class, unionism, socialism,'' said Joshua Freeman, author of the recent book ''Working-Class New York: Life and Labor Since World War II.'' New York's politics skewed so far to the left that in 1945, amid the Popular Front period, voters elected to the City Council two members apiece from the Communist, American Labor and Liberal parties. Organized labor in New York -- oriented around the heavily Jewish and Italian and significantly female needle-trade unions, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and the International Ladies Garment Workers Union -- stood at a cultural remove from the industrial unions in the heartland.</p>
        <p>''The idea that it was important for a worker to play the violin, to go to the symphony, never got transported across the Hudson, or at least beyond the Delaware,'' said William Serrin, the author of a forthcoming history of American labor unions, ''Standing Up to Remsnyder.'' ''Most labor leaders were nervous about culture and intellectuals. They were suspicious of so-called experts, of people of culture. They had the sense of not being respected by them. It's not as if the unions didn't have the money to do cultural work. They just didn't take the stuff seriously.''</p>
        <p>In part, of course, New York's unions used drama and song for the narrow purpose of mobilizing the rank and file, much as the city's political radicals often twisted art into agitprop for their own doctrines. But a purer kind of devotion coexisted with more expedient motives. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, for instance, published a quarterly journal called Labor and Culture, and in the fall 1941 issue, an article under the headline ''Workers and the Ballet'' maintained, ''A capable presentation of a ballet by union members is an argument for a higher standard of living for the American workers, and without a single word being spoken, it answers and silences criticism that culture belongs to wealth and it is not the place of workers to indulge in such enjoyment.''</p>
        <p>During the 1920's, a prosperous and complacent decade that in most of America eroded the left, radicals and unionists in New York began building their first projects. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers opened its first 300 apartments near Van Cortland Park, and Communist Party members erected the Allerton Co-ops alongside Bronx Park; elsewhere in the borough, both the Workmen's Circle, a Jewish socialist group, and the Farband, a Labor Zionist body, put up buildings.</p>
        <p>Simply by locating these projects in the leafy reaches of the northern Bronx, far from the pushcarts and sweatshops of the Lower East Side, the founders were subscribing to a ''very Romantic, very Enlightenment lust for nature,'' as Mr. Freeman put it. Gardens and courtyards, as much as political discussion groups, attested to the sensibility of the places. The Amalgamated's second complex, which replaced a block of tenements along Grand Street in Lower Manhattan in 1929, won a national award for design from the American Institute of Architects.</p>
        <p>Art and politics, however, made for uneasy mates. Amy Swerdlow, a historian who is writing a memoir of her childhood in the Allerton Co-ops, recalled marching with the Young Pioneers, learning Red Army anthems and listening to lectures about the wonderful republic called Birobidzhan that the Soviet Union would create for Jews. When Ms. Swerdlow finished third in a potato-sack race sponsored by the Hearst newspaper The Journal American, her parents forbade her to accept a medal from a ''social fascist.''</p>
        <p>Decades after losing any youthful illusions about Communism, Ms. Swerdlow clings to the broader cultural inheritance of the Co-ops -- the Rodin reproduction that shared shelf space in her family's apartment with a bust of Lenin; the Romantic novelists like Romain Rolland that her mother read in addition to Michael Gold; the household visits by Mani Leib, an immigrant poet influenced by Yiddish folk song, Russian literature and garment-factory labor. ''I could see the rigidity in my parents' world,'' Ms. Swerdlow said. ''But I could also see their search for culture, for only the best. For them, one way to escape the ghetto was to participate in culture.''</p>
        <p>The model of cooperative housing for workers -- specifically called ''limited-equity'' because a shareholder could resell a unit to the management only at a fixed, modest price -- thrived in New York for decades, ultimately providing 40,000 units. Between their low costs and their cultural traditions, they remained havens for both creative artists and their audiences. During the decades Aaron and Bernard Olshan have lived in the Amalgamated Houses, for example, their neighbors have included the Yiddish author Chaim Grade, the filmmaker and photographer Carol Foresta and the pianist Martin Goldray of the Philip Glass Ensemble. A production of a new opera, ''The Mill Girl,'' will have its premiere this fall in an auditorium in the Amalgamated Houses  named for the labor activist Baruch Vladek.</p>
        <p>Public housing in New York was born of an idealism different from  the sort that animated the union and radical communities. With its roots in the settlement-house movement rather than leftist ideology, it sought not to replace democratic capitalism but to ameliorate its harshest effects. The Great Depression put those effects on vast, visible display and, amid the New Deal's climate of government activism New York City in 1934, established the first municipal housing authority in the nation. More than simply providing clean, affordable quarters to the working poor, public housing aimed to soften the class divide and so help America ''in its fight against the isms,'' as one advocate wrote.</p>
        <p>From the outset, with a project on the Lower East Side deliberately called the First Houses, cultural elements figured into the city's plan. Those initial buildings featured bas-relief panels of wildlife on the exterior walls and fanciful sculptures of hippos and bears in the rear courtyard. Unlike the spartan high rises that later came to typify public housing in all its institutional bleakness, the First Houses and the other early projects rose just five or six stories and were often scattered over parklike grounds; the buildings incorporated stores, library branches, community rooms and health clinics. New York may well be the only city in America that has seen fit to confer landmark status on its housing projects -- First Houses, Harlem River Houses and Queensbridge Houses -- and even in the year 2000 shows them off as models to delegations from Hong Kong, Israel, Spain and Denmark.</p>
        <p>Those early projects also supplied the canvases, in effect, for artists employed by the Works Progress Administration. Much of the result fell into the expected style of social realism, typified by the murals of community life done by Marion Greenwood in the Red Hook Houses and Philip Guston in the Queensbridge project. But the city housing authority and the W.P.A. also clashed on issues endemic to the tension between culture and politics. When the sketches for murals for the Williamsburg Houses showed industrial scenes, the housing authority chairman Langdon Post complained in a letter to his chief architect, ''At the end of eight hours among machines and factory stacks, the painted images of more machines and factory stacks would be no more comfort and suggest no new and inviting horizon.'' Post asked instead for ''abstract and stimulating patterns in strong and beautiful colors.''</p>
        <p>He won the point, and the Williamsburg Houses wound up with the most important murals of any in the housing system, abstracts by artists like Ilya Bolotowsky and Paul Kelpe. The murals, though, also provided a cautionary tale of how quickly significant public art can be forgotten. As decades passed, every single one was painted over or completely blocked by shelves and cabinets. Only in the 1980's did the housing authority rediscover and restore them; now they form part of the Brooklyn Museum's permanent collection.</p>
        <p>The fate of the murals also hinted at broader changes within public housing in New York. The painstakingly designed projects of the 1930's, carefully integrated into surrounding neighborhoods, gave way in the 1950's and 1960's to high rises that Robert Moses, the city's chief of slum clearance and much else, deliberately placed outside middle-class areas. By the time new construction essentially ended in the 1980's, when the Reagan Administration drastically reduced federal funds for low-income housing, the city's projects held more than 400,000 residents. The image of public housing nationally was the spectacle of St. Louis and Newark demolishing their own projects as uninhabitable.</p>
        <p>Despite all this, New York continued to cultivate a more humane version, one with palpable links to the social compact sealed generations earlier. The city housing authority currently spends about half of its $2 billion annual budget on social services, a category wide enough to include day camps, gardens, horseback-riding and cultural programs.  The authority formed a symphony orchestra in 1971, just years before the city's near-bankruptcy threw its government liberalism into national disrepute, and went on to create an acting program in collaboration with the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute in 1982 and a youth chorus in 1997.</p>
        <p>The orchestra's founder, Janet Wolfe, was inspired partly by one of the grand traditions in working-class cultural life in New York -- the 25-cent classical concerts at Lewisohn Stadium. Anna Strasberg, who personally auditions housing authority residents for scholarships in acting, playwriting and scenic design, devised the program mindful of how her late husband had discovered theater in a Lower East Side settlement house as the immigrant child of a garment-worker father. Gregory McCants, director of the youth chorus, grew up in public housing.</p>
        <p>WHATEVER their sentimental appeal, these programs seek distinction by professional standards and have launched several careers. One of them is Manny Laureano's. A child of the Harbor Houses in East Harlem, a member of the Housing Authority Symphony Orchestra during his teens, Mr. Laureano now performs as principal trumpeter for the Minnesota Orchestra. ''I won't be as dramatic as to say that classical music saved me from the street,'' he said, ''but it was a piece of that pie. When I look back at how much playing I did, the sheer range of the repertory -- the Haydn trumpet concerto, Vivaldi, Dvorak, Mahler symphonies, some jazz stuff -- it seems xtraordinary.''</p>
        <p>The orchestra's story is not without its ironies. At the moment, even as the symphony performs regularly at housing projects, not one of its members comes from them. For financial reasons, it plays only rarely as a full unit, instead dispatching smaller woodwind, string, chamber or jazz ensembles. (There are tentative plans to start a youth orchestra to develop musicians from within the housing system.) The youth chorus, composed entirely of residents, sings pop, soul and gospel, though for its teenaged choristers Motown qualifies as a sort of classical music.</p>
        <p>More than any current program, the choir shows the social compact reinventing itself to reflect a working-class population that is largely nonwhite and traces its origins to Africa, Asia and the Caribbean basin rather than Eastern Europe. Besides performing within the housing authority developments, the chorus has already appeared in places as lofty as Madison Square Garden, the Apollo Theater and Disney World.</p>
        <p>Still, the earlier generation that fervently created and consumed the arts is aging and dying off. So elderly is the population in the limited-equity cooperatives that most have been formally designated as retirement communities; in Penn South, for instance, two-thirds of the residents are older than 65. At the same time, the lure of privatization has reached even these labor union strongholds. The residents of Cooperative Village, a 4,500-unit complex on the Lower East Side, have voted to let co-op prices float on the free market, driving apartment prices toward $500,000.</p>
        <p>''The sense of identification with the original cultural heritage has been lost,'' said Ken Wray, the executive director of the United Housing Foundation, which develops limited-equity projects. ''The identification isn't with a greater community of workers. It's, 'Why shouldn't workers be able to have a windfall just like rich folks?' ''</p>
        <p>And in the new demographics of working-class New York, the ardor for a European ideal of high culture has waned. ''I remember as a kid the way Van Cliburn was a national hero,'' said Joshua Freeman, the author. ''It's hard to imagine any classical musicians filling that role today. Maybe there's nothing unique about the erosion of high culture's influence in the working class, because its role in the whole population has diminished.''</p>
        <p>Yet on a recent Wednesday morning Beatrice Perlmutter, a retired labor union secretary and the child of two socialists, grabbed a front-row folding chair in the Penn South senior citizens' center for the weekly class in ''The Art of Listening.'' Listen she did as the instructor, John Balamos, guided three dozen students from Arabic rai music through several Steve Reich compositions into Bach's Cantata No. 140 and English Suite No. 2, all by way of teaching about the uses of rhythm. Mr. Balamos's aural syllabus was more eclectic and demanding than what most concert halls or radio programs would dare present, and Ms. Perlmutter devoured it as pure nourishment.</p>
        <p>''I can't detach myself from my roots,'' she explained later. ''My parents gave me that desire to always look for something civilized. Culture is so much more important than materialism. There are ideals, and if we don't have them, we die spiritually. So going to this class at age 78 is just part of me. Eating, sleeping, and feeding on what's out there culturally.''</p>
