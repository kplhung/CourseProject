        <p>SO whatever happened to medical savings accounts?</p>
        <p>Please pick your eyelids off the floor. This is actually an important question. These accounts, which allow some income to be put aside each year, untaxed, to pay for health care, were presented just a few years ago as a panacea for the Big Health Insurance Crisis. They have not exactly caught fire, and the reasons say much.</p>
        <p>Congress created the accounts in 1997, specifically to help workers at small businesses with 50 or fewer employees -- companies that often cannot afford other kinds of health benefits. The accounts are paired with bare-bones catastrophic health insurance with a high deductible, $1,500 to $2,250 for individuals or $3,000 to $4,500 for families.</p>
        <p>The savings account can be used to pay medical costs not covered by the insurance, including those needed to satisfy the deductible. The worker or the employer can put aside in the account each year, exempt from income tax, up to 65 percent of the deductible amount (for an individual worker) or 75 percent (for family coverage). If the employer pays, the contribution is also exempt from employment tax.</p>
        <p>Don't confuse these accounts with the somewhat similar flexible spending accounts that many big companies offer. Though both types of accounts work by setting aside untaxed income to cover unreimbursed health costs, the money in a flexible spending account is lost if not used by the end of the year, and the accounts are usually offered to workers with regular health benefits. With medical savings accounts, money can accumulate from year to year, but workers who have other kinds of health coverage are ineligible.</p>
        <p>In fact, proponents of medical savings accounts even extolled them as a way to sidestep the problems of managed care, because people who use them can go to doctors of their choosing whenever they want, and still save money by paying part of the cost with untaxed income.</p>
        <p>The pilot project approved by Congress is limited to the first 750,000 workers to sign up, but that ceiling has never been approached. So far, only about 100,000 accounts have been established. Many employers know little or nothing about the program, and dozens of insurance companies, including Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York, have stopped offering the accounts because of lack of interest.</p>
        <p>Unless Congress renews it, the law will expire on Dec. 31. That's a shame, because with a bit of tweaking, the accounts could be much more successful.</p>
        <p>THE dismal performance of the medical savings account program points up what can happen when the political system lays its hands on health care. Medical savings accounts were first introduced as part of broad health care legislation in 1996, with wide support from Republican leaders. Many Democrats opposed the plan as unfair, and what was left after negotiations was a program so restricted and confusing that few people understood it and fewer could be bothered to take part.</p>
        <p>For one thing, eligibility was limited to the companies and people least likely to experiment with them. ''Confining M.S.A.'s to the small employment market was a terrible idea,'' said Greg Scandlen, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis. When it comes to benefits, these employers are ''not innovators,'' he said, ''because they don't have time to think about it.''</p>
        <p>Further, laws in some states keep small business owners from offering M.S.A.'s.</p>
        <p>Then there are the law's inflexible requirements for deductibles. Workers who already had basic insurance plans with different deductibles, either higher or lower, could not take advantage of the accounts. Scrapping an existing plan only to pay more for one with a higher deductible was hardly an attractive option.</p>
        <p>The law also permits contributions by employers or employees, but not both -- a bizarre requirement when most benefit plans involve sharing the cost between employers and workers. It takes no account of regional differences in health care costs. And figuring out how to make contributions is no cinch. ''It is confusing, particularly for families,'' Mr. Scandlen said. ''If you can't explain the concept in 15 seconds, then you are basically lost.''</p>
        <p>Because so many insurers have dropped these plans, almost no effort is being made to evangelize small employers on the subject. ''To tell you the truth, I never reviewed with my accountant whether they would be cheaper,'' said Brian Zimmet, who runs a small law firm in Manhattan. ''No one ever tried to market it to me. I offer an H.M.O. -- it is not cheap, maybe $400 a month for each employee, but in order to attract qualified employees I need to have it.''</p>
        <p>WHO the plans are best suited for remains in debate. Critics thought that only highly paid people would use the accounts, but some studies show that this has not been the case. The rollover feature would seem to be advantageous for the young and healthy, who can salt away years of tax-free savings for use later in life. But if a big, expensive illness strikes, 75 percent of $3,000 doesn't go far.</p>
        <p>''Right now, you are really unable to put enough money away to cover a really serious health issue like cancer,'' said Maria Berthoud, vice president for federal government affairs at the Independent Insurance Agents of America.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berthoud and others say they believe that Congress will expand medical savings accounts to cover a wider swath of workers, and perhaps make other adjustments. ''I think that the prospects for renewal are very good,'' said Ms. Berthoud, adding that if Congress relaxes some of the restrictions, as she expects, participation will rise sharply.</p>
        <p>For that to happen, support will have to come from both political parties. But Ms. Berthoud is optimistic that this time, Congress will get it right. ''Medical savings accounts were a classic example of good policy getting jettisoned by politics,'' she said.</p>
