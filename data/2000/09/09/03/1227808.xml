        <p>The owner of two Chinese takeout restaurants in Queens was bludgeoned to death late Friday during an apparent robbery attempt outside an unoccupied house where he had been summoned to deliver food from one of his establishments, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Jin-Sheng Liu, 44, who owned the Golden Wok at 192-15 Linden Boulevard in St. Albans and another restaurant, was struck on the head shortly before midnight in front of the house, at 130-19 176th Street, which sits across from a wooded area on the quiet residential street in the Springfield Gardens neighborhood, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police were investigating whether Mr. Liu had been lured by someone ordering food so that he could be robbed in a desolate spot, said Officer Chris Cottingham, a police spokesman. Detectives recovered at least one brick at the scene and the police were conducting tests to determine whether it was the murder weapon.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, the bag of Chinese food that Mr. Liu had been carrying was still on the sidewalk outside the dilapidated house.</p>
        <p>One neighbor, Carmen Martinez, said she had ordered food in the past from Mr. Liu's restaurant, which is about a mile and a half away.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martinez, who has lived on the block for three years with her children, said they heard a loud noise about 11:30 p.m. on Friday. ''We heard a big bang,'' she said. ''We thought it was our kids playing in the bathroom. I just hope they find that person and do what they've got to do with them.''</p>
        <p>Lin Yun, the manager of King's Wok, an eatery a few blocks from Mr. Liu's restaurant, said Mr. Liu, who has two children in their early 20's, would make the deliveries for the Golden Wok himself. He said Mr. Liu had once owned three restaurants, but had sold one of the businesses.</p>
        <p>Jim Rodney, who recently bought the building that houses the Golden Wok, said that Mr. Liu had been in the United States for about 10 years, but that the two had had little direct contact because the restaurant owner spoke almost no English. Mr. Rodney said, however, that Mr. Liu and his wife always seemed to be working in the small takeout shop. The last time he saw Mr. Liu, Mr. Rodney said, he was cooking rice in the restaurant's kitchen.</p>
        <p>''To come to America to better your life, to lose your life in that manner is sad,'' he said.</p>
