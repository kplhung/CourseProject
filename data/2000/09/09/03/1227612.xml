        <p>Needing a place to lock up dangerous offenders, the New Jersey Department of Corrections decided this month to take the well-worn path to Cumberland County, already the home of four prisons, more than 8,000 inmates and the recession-proof growth industry they have brought to the far reaches of South Jersey.</p>

        <p>Needing a place to lock up dangerous offenders, the New Jersey Department of Corrections decided this month to take the well-worn path to Cumberland County, already the home of four prisons, more than 8,000 inmates and the recession-proof growth industry they have brought to the far reaches of South Jersey.</p>
        <p>But the men to be sent here are not the usual burglars and drug dealers; they are sex offenders ordered committed by the courts after serving their prison terms. And what looked like the path of least resistance has led to fierce resistance as county leaders and state legislators promise to fight the agreement by Maurice River Township to take this group.</p>
        <p>''This is basically economic profiling,'' said Freeholder Director Douglas Fisher. He noted that several years ago the state tried to put a nuclear waste dump in Fairfield, the poorest township in the state's poorest county, and has now turned to Maurice River, barely better off, as its ''dumping ground for violent sexual predators.''</p>
        <p>The township already has two state prisons, Bayside and Southern State, on a 13,000-acre tract of marsh, forest and cornfields along Route 47. The new 300-bed institution is to be built on the Bayside grounds, though the exact site has not been fixed.</p>
        <p>Prisons -- which account for 1.7 percent of the state's population and about a quarter of the Department of Corrections' population -- are the biggest business in the county. A total of about 5,000 people work at Bayside and Southern State, as well as the new South Woods State Prison in Bridgeton and the Fairton Federal Correctional Institution in Fairfield Township. Among them is Maurice River Township's mayor, Ronald D. Riggins Sr., a sergeant at Southern State.</p>
        <p>The Department of Corrections had planned to build in Woodbridge, which challenged the proposed facility in court, choosing Maurice River instead a few weeks ago. Mr. Fisher said the decision caught county officials by surprise. He said Jack Terhune, the corrections commissioner, assured him last year that ''he would not push to locate it here.''</p>
        <p>Through a spokesman, Chris Carden, the commissioner declined to comment. Mr. Carden would only say, ''We're going forward with the site at Bayside.'</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher has asked the governor for a moratorium on prison construction in the county, and three other freeholders are planning hearings next month. Assemblyman Nicholas Asselta and Senator James Cafiero have protested, along with officials in Vineland, Millville and Dennis Township.</p>
        <p>''There's no one in favor of this,'' Mr. Fisher said.</p>
        <p>All of them are trying to overturn the vote of the three-member township committee on Aug. 17 unanimously adopting a resolution to accept the new unit in exchange for a payment of $825,000 a year by the state. The township's current budget is $3.6 million, of which $300,000 comes from state payments for Bayside and Southern State.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fisher said he was not unsympathetic to the township committee, which he said was apparently bullied by the state. And Freeholder Louis Magazzu, who is calling for hearings, said he wanted to look at ''what is driving the need for Morris River Township to be open to this.''</p>
        <p>The reason, Mr. Magazzu said, was fiscal desperation, in part because the state did not give Maurice River Township payments comparable to those it gave Camden and Bridgeton -- each $1 million -- for the two prisons it already has.</p>
        <p>Deputy Mayor Andrew Sarclette said the concern from freeholders and state legislators was a bit late. ''We have been fighting for more money for years, and our school situation is atrocious,'' Mr. Sarclette said. ''Where were they then?''</p>
        <p>He said that while they publicly urged a halt to the plan, none of the state and county officials had even placed a call to Maurice River Township. ''That's what discourages me most,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sarclette said that the resolution was simply a statement of support and that the committee members had not made any deal with the state. Still, he made clear that they were ready to sign an agreement.</p>
        <p>''There's no way we can ever get these kinds of ratables'', he said. ''A few people I've talked to tell me they're not thrilled about sex offenders, but the majority I speak with will take the money.''</p>
        <p>Residents acknowledge that the state payments and salaries -- corrections officers, for example, earn $36,100 to $55,300 a year -- are keeping Maurice River Township afloat.</p>
        <p>As she checked out at Lillians Produce Market, a few miles up the road from the prisons, Gladys Holmes, a 77-year-old lifetime resident of the township, noted that there were prison employees in all four houses across the street from hers. ''They do have good benefits and good pay,'' Ms. Holmes said. ''I just wish they hadn't started the whole thing.''</p>
        <p>Behind the counter, Kathy Giles nodded in agreement. ''They used to have the canning houses and clamming and oystering here,'' Ms. Giles said. ''But they're gone, and a lot of people who aren't skilled are stuck with whatever they can get.''</p>
        <p>The owner of the market, Pat Buganski, volunteered that she grew up on the farm across the street from the prison dairy, a minimum-security unit, where the inmates ''weren't too scary.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Buganski also said that after Bayside was built in 1969, ''Mom said, 'There won't be murderers. There won't be sex offenders.' ''</p>
        <p>Bayside and Southern State, primarily medium-security prisons, have housed some sex offenders, but the state has never had a unit like the one to be built here.</p>
        <p>Nothing like it existed when the ominously named Sexually Violent Predator Act was passed in 1998. Enacted four years after Megan's law, it changed the standard for the civil commitment of sex offenders who had served their terms but were deemed too violent to be released. The law also required that the corrections department and Department of Human Services establish a new class of institution for such offenders, who had previously been confined in state psychiatric hospitals.</p>
        <p>About 150 men are expected at what is now called the Special Treatment Unit, while those who are most seriously mentally ill will continue to go to the state forensic hospital in Trenton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carden said that security measures for the new unit were still under discussion but that the department could not apply its usual classifications to people held under civil rather than criminal law.</p>
        <p>James Goff, the president of the Patrolmens Benevolent Association Local 105, which represents corrections officers, said the Department of Corrections was retreating from a pledge it made to Woodbridge to build a maximum-custody facility. He also said the township committee failed to make clear to residents that it would house inmates who had committed violent crimes.</p>
        <p>''The more politically pleasing term is civilly committed offender,'' Mr. Goff said. ''But basically, they're warehousing people too violent to be returned to society.</p>
        <p>''The lackadaisical attitude of the department is, 'We got a lot of flak in North Jersey, so well shove it in South Jersey,' '' he added. ''And they're going to downgrade the level of security.''</p>
        <p>Especially after the example of Raymond Alves, the rapist who was prematurely and improperly released from Southern State in March, many residents are nervous about security beyond the state's control.</p>
        <p>Ms. Giles said some prisoners stay in the area after their release, and she said ''a lot of people in the community worry'' that sex offenders will be even more inclined to do so. ''Lets face it,'' she said. ''They have a hard time going back to where they came from.''</p>
