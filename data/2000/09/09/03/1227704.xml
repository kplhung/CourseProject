        <p>LAST month, just in time for Labor Day, I did something I haven't done since working my way through college as a doorman. I joined a union.</p>
        <p>Worse yet, it's a union of writers -- even though, in my experience, every writers' organization is either an oxymoron or a shambles. But whether writers have a union, or whether that union includes me, isn't the point. What matters is the unusual nature of the group I joined, the National Writers Union; it could offer an interesting model for other unions hoping for redemption from the long twilight of irrelevance to which they have helped to consign themselves.</p>
        <p>In some very important ways, the National Writers Union is the union of the future, and the apparatchiks who run more old-fashioned unions had better take notice. The United Auto Workers did just that eight years ago, when it took in the writers' union as one of its locals.</p>
        <p>''Nontraditional workers are a growing field,'' said Phil Wheeler, director of the U.A.W.'s northeast region. Of the writers, he said, ''We felt we could learn from them, and we could be very helpful to them.''</p>
        <p>(I must say I feel pretty macho belonging to what is now Local 1981 of the U.A.W., and I look forward to a nice jacket or at least a logo-bedecked baseball cap.)</p>
        <p>Since affiliating with the U.A.W., the writers' union has grown to 6,300 members from roughly 2,500, according to its president, Jonathan Tasini. Admittedly, those are still small numbers in a big country.</p>
        <p>But the union may be on to something. It represents private-sector knowledge workers, whom traditional unions have had little success in trying to organize. And the writer-members are largely self-employed, which means that the union does its work without benefit of the National Labor Relations Board. Just about all these workers use computers, and many have electronic-rights issues. They usually must buy their own health insurance. And a big proportion of them are women.</p>
        <p>In short, the labor force of the future.</p>
        <p>That is what makes the union so interesting. The first Labor Day of the 21st century, after all, finds American unions in general representing fewer than 10 percent of all private-sector workers and struggling to keep up with the changing nature of work and the work force. Against so gloomy a backdrop, the writers' union, at least, understands the problem -- and is growing.</p>
        <p>The organization has also foresworn the basic tactic of many other unions, which try to force pay and benefits upward by turning the work force into a cartel. Mr. Tasini acknowledged that his union lacked such power, and anyhow, he'd prefer to have a union that people actually want to join, not one seen as an overbearing dues-gobbler.</p>
        <p>The union's battle to gain electronic reprint rights for its members has attracted the most attention. Personally, I doubt that most writers will see big money from electronic rights any time soon. But someday we might, and meanwhile even nickels and dimes from the millions of Internet users out there can add up to worthwhile amounts.</p>
        <p>To make it easier for publishers to comply, the union has set up a Publication Rights Clearinghouse to run a licensing and royalty program akin to Ascap and BMI in the music industry. One online publisher, Steven Brill's new Contentville.com, has already signed an agreement giving writers (through the clearinghouse) 30 percent of its fee when an article is downloaded, or about 90 cents of a typical $3 charge.</p>
        <p>The union also maintains a database of job openings, offers group rates on medical insurance and is the only place I can think of where individual writers can find affordable, comprehensive libel insurance.</p>
        <p>That is not to say that the National Writers Union is some kind of latter-day workers' paradise. The jobs in its database do not look very appealing, and there is an odor of political correctness about the organization's Web site -- a report from the inevitable diversity committee is signed ''In Solidarity.'' Moreover, it makes me uncomfortable professionally to belong to an organization that lobbies members of Congress for help, as it has in its e-rights campaign.</p>
        <p>Then again, publishers try to influence policy in their favor, so why should an organization of writers disarm unilaterally? And I belong to other groups with which I don't always agree, from the Democratic Party to the American Automobile Association. Heck, I'm a member of Sam's Club.</p>
        <p>Hmm. I wonder if they give any kind of union discount.</p>
