        <p>Q: You made a fortune financing start-up firms like Hotmail. Now you're plunking down $20 million of your money to support a November ballot measure that would give all California schoolkids a $4,000 voucher to use at the school of their choice. That's $20 million just to support the initiative, not to build new schools or anything. Why?</p>
        <p>I felt somebody had to stand up for the kids and say, Hey, something's wrong. Our educational system is failing us. It's time for a change.</p>

        <p>Q: You made a fortune financing start-up firms like Hotmail. Now you're plunking down $20 million of your money to support a November ballot measure that would give all California schoolkids a $4,000 voucher to use at the school of their choice. That's $20 million just to support the initiative, not to build new schools or anything. Why?</p>
        <p>I felt somebody had to stand up for the kids and say, Hey, something's wrong. Our educational system is failing us. It's time for a change.</p>
        <p>Is it good for democracy that a rich guy like you can in effect buy a policy that affects millions of kids?</p>
        <p>The teachers' unions are spending a lot of money to fight this. All I'm trying to do is level the playing field. They're taking money from other people. At least I'm spending my own money, and standing up against a system of collusion between the politicians and the union bosses.</p>
        <p>You're not the only person to spend a lot of his own money on politics. But people like Jon Corzine or Al Checchi or Ross Perot or even Michael Huffington have done it in order to get elected, to make a long-term commitment to leadership. Did you consider going that route, rather than financing this one initiative?</p>
        <p>I was on the state Board of Education, and I don't believe that there is a single elected position in the state that could get a school-voucher initiative passed. This had to be done through an initiative process. Governor Davis got a whole bunch of money from the California Teachers Association. He's in a bind. Most of the politicians have, too. It is very unlikely that they would vote for this even though it is in the best interest of the children. It's politically impossible to do.</p>
        <p>Your plan would give vouchers to all kids -- even really rich kids. Won't some taxpayers object to giving thousands of dollars to kids who already live in mansions?</p>
        <p>The initiative allows everyone the opportunity to take a voucher. This is not rich and this is not poor and this is not middle class. It is everyone. And $4,000 means an awful lot more in South-Central L.A. than it does in Brentwood. In our polling, people feel that it's only fair that everyone has an opportunity to move a child into schools that are working. They did not feel that special treatment for people in failed schools, or special treatment for any particular type of person, was fair, and I agree.</p>
        <p>If you're going to create something that ends up affecting five million children, it has to be very fair.</p>
        <p>But what happens if everyone just takes the vouchers and leaves? What if everyone abandons the public school system?</p>
        <p>Then they would end up in private schools or voucher schools. There are an awful lot of children who would like to get out of the bad public schools. That's the whole point.</p>
        <p>What percentage of your net worth are you putting into this thing?</p>
        <p>I would never show my cards.</p>
        <p>Is $20 million perhaps. . . .</p>
        <p>You're not going to get an answer.</p>
        <p>O.K., fine. But you grew up wealthy and had every advantage. Why should inner-city parents trust you to look out for their interests?</p>
        <p>I had a lot of advantages. I've had a wonderful upbringing and a wonderful life. So in that way I would think people would feel good about somebody who feels that the American dream is alive and well, who wants it to be available to everybody.</p>
        <p>Hmmm, maybe you're planning to run for office after all. So having tried them both, what's harder, venture capital or politics?</p>
        <p>They both have their moments.</p>
