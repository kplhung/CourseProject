        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his observations about the differences in the Brazilian and foreign receptions of two very distinct cinematic renditions of the Orpheus tale [''Orpheus, Rising From Caricature,'' Aug. 20], Caetano Veloso makes a number of larger, insightful points about the intense processes of creolization in Brazilian popular culture, which confound easy labels like ''global'' and ''local'' as well as ''authentic'' and ''pure.''</p>
        <p>Two points raised by Mr. Veloso are in tension, however, with his advocacy of what he has called ''subversive Pan-Americanism.'' First, Mr. Veloso seemingly abides by a key tenet of Gilberto Freyre's views about Brazilian race relations, one that equates miscegenation with ''racial democracy.'' Although Mr. Veloso rightly acknowledges that ideas of whitening are not peculiar to Brazil, he does not mention the effects of such ideologies on darker-skinned African-descended people in Brazil and elsewhere in the Americas -- which, in the case of someone like Michael Jackson (whom Mr. Veloso mentions), are more than a case of playful hybridity.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his observations about the differences in the Brazilian and foreign receptions of two very distinct cinematic renditions of the Orpheus tale [''Orpheus, Rising From Caricature,'' Aug. 20], Caetano Veloso makes a number of larger, insightful points about the intense processes of creolization in Brazilian popular culture, which confound easy labels like ''global'' and ''local'' as well as ''authentic'' and ''pure.''</p>
        <p>Two points raised by Mr. Veloso are in tension, however, with his advocacy of what he has called ''subversive Pan-Americanism.'' First, Mr. Veloso seemingly abides by a key tenet of Gilberto Freyre's views about Brazilian race relations, one that equates miscegenation with ''racial democracy.'' Although Mr. Veloso rightly acknowledges that ideas of whitening are not peculiar to Brazil, he does not mention the effects of such ideologies on darker-skinned African-descended people in Brazil and elsewhere in the Americas -- which, in the case of someone like Michael Jackson (whom Mr. Veloso mentions), are more than a case of playful hybridity.</p>
        <p>Like Gilberto Freyre, Mr. Veloso seems to be suggesting that miscegenation leads to racial tolerance, whereas hypodescent (the one-drop rule) does not. If one were to apply Mr. Veloso's premise, that racial miscegenation equals racial democracy, to race relations in the United States, South Africa or Haiti, then the fact of miscegenation would have helped engender societies that were more tolerant of alleged racial differences among their populations. It did not.</p>
        <p>The point here is that miscegenation, in Brazil and in other former slave-holding societies, began as acts of dominance and not as an egalitarian principle that led to the erosion of unequal relations. It is important to remember that the etymological origin of the term miscegenation (as well as mulatto, by the way) is to ''mis-mate,'' or mate badly. In Brazil, the celebration of miscegenation has occurred simultaneously in national popular culture and mythology with terminology that denigrates darker-skinned Brazilians, while upholding Northern European ideals of feminine and masculine beauty. Thus, miscegenation cannot be considered outside the lens of power and aesthetics.</p>
        <p>The ideologies of ''whitening'' and racial democracy in Brazil assume unequal relations between white elites and black and brown Brazilians; and even more specifically, the black and brown women who are expected to fulfill idealized versions of Brazilian feminine beauty -- brown but not too dark. As in other societies where ''whitening'' prevails, the painful legacies of racial domination remain in Brazil. This is the crux of the critique of Gilberto Freyre's notions of racial egalitarianism in Brazil in my book ''Orpheus and Power,'' which Mr. Veloso cites.</p>
        <p>The black movement in Brazil has long promoted alternative visions of black aesthetics (like the dreadlocks Mr. Veloso refers to) as a means of countering the negative imagery of blacks often found in Brazilian cinema, mass media and literature. That they should do so in a society whose racial lines of demarcation are not founded on the ''one-drop rule'' as in the United States suggests that quests for racial solidarity and uplift among African-descended peoples are not restricted to a particular state or society, and that there may be some commonalities across multi-racial societies in the Americas and elsewhere. Attempts to counter negative imagery of blacks and promote true racial democracy do not automatically lead to ''racial intolerance'' as Mr. Veloso suggests, but could be part of the subversive Pan-Americanism that he advocates, and that I applaud.</p>
