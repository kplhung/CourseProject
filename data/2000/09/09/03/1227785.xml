        <p>This morning in northern New Jersey, Kerry Collins won't be driving his car to the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>It's certainly a big enough day for a meditative ride from his Hackensack apartment to Giants Stadium, where Collins will make his first start as the unilateral and figurative leader of the Giants, a mantle only a quarterback can claim.</p>
        <p>Collins will instead be driven to the stadium for the opening game with Arizona by receiver Joe Jurevicius. With his driver's license suspended until Feb. 1, Collins won't be driving to any games this year.</p>
        <p>It's an inconvenience, the millionaire athlete who needs a lift to grocery shop.</p>
        <p>More telling: A penalty for drunken driving is the last remnant of Collins's famously troubled football season two years ago.</p>
        <p>The fall of 1998 was a fireball of strife for Collins, a stunning decline from athletic idol to object of scorn, all crystallized in one early-morning meeting in the office of Carolina Panthers Coach Dom Capers. Capers came out of that meeting and announced that Collins had quit. Capers no longer discusses the meeting and Collins has never given his side.</p>
        <p>But late one afternoon last week, Collins said of that day: ''As it turned out, it was the best thing that ever happened to me.''</p>
        <p>Having coaches, teammates, fans and the news media vilify you for months is hardly the typical criterion for a life-defining moment, but the contemplative Collins, now 27, puts it in perspective.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't the most glorious day,'' he said. ''But I probably thought it was best.'' Collins said he knew there would be difficult things to put up with, ''but at the same time, I saw no happy way out.''</p>
        <p>''I know some of it was my fault and I hadn't dealt with a lot of things well,'' he said. ''I wasn't the happiest person because I didn't have the support I needed. I hadn't, for example, talked to my parents in a year.</p>
        <p>''People tried to help me and tell me what to do with my life, but I didn't want to listen.''</p>
        <p>Collins seeks no absolution and avoids the subject of his 1998 problems. He knows how some still view him; he hears it from the stands when the team is on the road. But if there is a window to Collins's future -- and reason to believe he can fix the Giants' quarterback situation -- it is how far removed Collins feels from his past.</p>
        <p>He came to the Giants 18 months ago wanting people to know, to use his own words, that he wasn't a drunk, a quitter or a racist.</p>
        <p>Asked last week what he wants fans to know about him now, Collins did not hesitate with his answer.</p>
        <p>''I want them to know that I can play,'' he said. ''That I'm playing as well as I ever have in my career. So much has been said about the off-the-field stuff, the question of whether I can play has gotten lost.''</p>
        <p>In the locker room, Collins has won over a skeptical audience. The defense's leaders, linebacker Jessie Armstead and end Michael Strahan, welcomed Collins last year, but there was an underlying wait-and-see attitude. The defense is driven by results, and from Dave Brown to Tommy Maddox to Danny Kanell to Kent Graham, disillusionment followed every quarterback makeover.</p>
        <p>Then Collins took over for Graham late last year and threw for 341 yards in a romp against the Jets. In the off-season, his teammates saw Collins tramp through the snow to the team's indoor facility daily to throw dozens of passes to the receivers. They noticed that he hung around late, sometimes going up to the team's offices, where Collins made himself at home with the organization and the coaching staff.</p>
        <p>Collins, who said he no longer drinks, led a quiet life away from the locker room. ''No bars, no clubs, and I'm thankful that I don't need to go to them,'' he said. He went to night school, seeking a master's degree in addiction counseling.</p>
        <p>By this summer's training camp, Collins had taken command, speaking out in team meetings and yelling orders in practice when teammates made mistakes.</p>
        <p>Armstead, who says he does not like any offensive players when he is on the field, was moved by what he observed. He said of Collins: ''I'm going to fight for the guy. We haven't had a guy around here say, 'This is my show.' But that's Kerry. He told those guys that he's the navigator of the ship, sink or swim.''</p>
        <p>Strahan threw in his support on similar grounds. ''We've been waiting for somebody on the other side of the ball to stand up and say, 'O.K., this is my team, too,' '' Strahan said. ''Kerry has done that.''</p>
        <p>Of course, while he has had a good preseason, completing 61 percent of his passes, Collins has thrown far more interceptions (47) than touchdowns (31) in the three seasons since his best year, 1996. In the National Football League, while most have accepted that he has matured personally, an equal number wonder if he will ever show the pocket poise of a dominant quarterback.</p>
        <p>''The way I've played the last few years, that kind of thinking isn't unjustified,'' Collins said. ''It doesn't mean it can't be changed. I have such a different commitment to the position now. I used to play well and not even be able to tell you why.''</p>
        <p>That includes the 1996 season, when Collins went to the Pro Bowl.</p>
        <p>''Back then,'' Collins said, ''I had never made my job the 100 percent priority.''</p>
        <p>The Giants have always tried to replicate the family-style atmosphere Collins enjoyed as an all-American at Penn State. ''That was something we thought we could do,'' General Manager Ernie Accorsi said. ''And those were his happiest days.''</p>
        <p>Before the 1995 draft, Collins was quoted extensively as saying he wanted to be selected by one of the older franchises, mentioning Chicago, Washington, Philadelphia and the Giants. But he went to expansion Carolina.</p>
        <p>''I've always sought structure, tradition and accountability,'' he said last week. ''It's one of the reasons I went to Penn State. The Giants have been perfect for me. I'm humbled by the sense that I'm the quarterback of the New York Giants.''</p>
        <p>Collins said he would feel the weight of the assignment as he comes upon Giants Stadium today.</p>
        <p>''It will be a big moment,'' he said, acknowledging the turbulent circumstances that have led to the occasion, including the one that remains.</p>
        <p>''Can't drive,'' the Giants' new quarterback said, smiling. ''Lesson learned.''</p>
