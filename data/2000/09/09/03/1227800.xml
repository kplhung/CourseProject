        <p>New Yorkers were eating on the run centuries before the creation of fast-food concessions. In the 1600's, when the first Dutch settlers arrived, the bays contained rich stocks of oysters. Oysters measuring a foot or more in length were common. Hungry people could just reach down into the water and grab a couple.</p>
        <p>New York's first concession stands, built in the 1700's, sold fresh oysters and cherrystone and littleneck clams. Between 1830 and 1870, they were enormously popular, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City. These oyster stands were located throughout the city. Workingmen -- clerks, laborers and their bosses -- would stand on the sidewalk and swallow a few dozen oysters, then wash them down with a pint of ale. By World War II, oyster stands were far less common, and today they have nearly disappeared.</p>

        <p>New York's first concession stands, built in the 1700's, sold fresh oysters and cherrystone and littleneck clams. Between 1830 and 1870, they were enormously popular, according to the Encyclopedia of New York City. These oyster stands were located throughout the city.

        <p>Stands that sold Collier's magazine and a dozen or so daily newspapers, along with cigars, chocolate bars and bananas, also date to the 18th century. Some Depression-era snacks and magazines can still be found at the newsstands of today: Milky Way bars, for instance, and Redbook and Harper's Bazaar.</p>
        <p>The concession stand snacks of today -- the  ices, burgers and fries -- are all well and good. Some snacks, like tacos and Italian sausage, can be delicious. But fresh oysters on the half shell on every other street corner -- that is a loss worth mourning.</p>
