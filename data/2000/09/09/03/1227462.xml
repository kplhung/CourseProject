        <p>After Bill Clinton expressed contrition at a preconvention interview at a church gathering in Illinois, the Rev. Bill Hybels, one of his pastoral advisers, put his hand on the president's shoulder and prayed with him, saying, ''Thank you, God, that you wired him up the way you did.''</p>
        <p>Wired bids fair to be the most multisensed ''hot'' word on the American linguistic scene. No other old word has more new meanings. Up to 1980, according to a search engine that puff-puffs its way through all the libraries in the world, 61 books had wired in the title, but in the past 20 years, almost 400 more have been added. The noun began in the Latin viere, ''to plait,'' and the Greek iris, ''rainbow.'' The Old High German wiara meant ''fine gold work.'' As a verb, its early definitions -- fasten or strengthen with a metal tie'' and ''connect in an electrical circuit'' -- remain, but in our technological time the wound-together word has burst into a rainbow of senses.</p>
        <p>Wired for sound, applied in the 50's to people wearing hearing aids, was the name of a 1986 song by Michael W. Smith and Wayne Kirkpatrick. This was in the Christian contemporary rock section of music stores, deploring the difficulty of studying the Word of God amid the cacophony of ''a world that's wired for sound.''</p>
        <p>An entirely different meaning of wired for sound was emerging at the same time: ''The joint is wired. . . . ''wrote J. D. MacDonald in a 1957 novel, ''A Man of Affairs.'' ''The next step is cameras and infrared and tape recorders, I guess.'' The single word wire stood for ''electronic eavesdropping.'' A person fitted with a surreptitious recording device to help others spy on conversations is said to wear a wire. This was what Monica Lewinsky refused to do for investigators for the independent counsel looking into her relationship with the president.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, beginning in 1969, another meaning was taking root: ''high on amphetamine drugs; manic.'' A mild precursor of this, reported by John Farmer in his 1890 slang dictionary, was ''irritated; provoked.'' The sense of its modern offshoot, not necessarily drug-related, ranges from ''edgy, jumpy, uptight'' to ''pumped up, visibly nervous'' to ''feverishly excited.'' It was the title of Bob Woodward's 1984 book, ''Wired: The Short Life and Fast Times of John Belushi.''</p>
        <p>A sense also first cited in 1969 is from the computer world: ''having circuits connected permanently and designed for an unchangeable function.'' Scientific American noted in 1981 that ''it is a rule of thumb in computer science that an operation can be executed fastest when it is hard-wired into the computer rather than specified as part of a program.'' Why ''hard''? Because that differentiates it strongly from the software, which is not part of the machine's wiring.</p>
        <p>This computer meaning was quickly transferred to neuroscience and applied</p>
        <p>to the workings of the brain. ''These cells are hard-wired and ready for action,'' wrote The New Scientist in 1971, ''as soon as the kitten opens its eyes.'' In a few years the professor of astronomy Carl Sagan was writing, ''The brain is completely hard-wired: specific cognitive functions are localized in particular places in the brain,'' an assertion since largely confirmed by imaging technology, though experience or accident can cause ''rewiring'' to take place. This year, the New York Times architectural critic Herbert Muschamp, writing about the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla, Calif., noted that the Nobel laureate Gerald Edelman's institute was ''partly inspired by Dr. Edelman's theory that the brain's architecture is shaped by our experiences. Tell me what you like, and I will tell you how you're wired.''</p>
        <p>That sense was later applied to more general opinions or abilities. When Joseph Lieberman was chosen by Al Gore to be his running mate, Rabbi Avi Shafran told The New York Times that concern about Jewish visibility in politics was ''sort of hard-wired into our system, for better or worse.'' Similarly, a coach for the California Bears recently told The San Francisco Chronicle that he had high hopes for a young player because ''he's wired the right way for a quarterback'' -- that is, he had the stable temperament and quick reactions suited to that position.</p>
        <p>As the Internet came into being, another new sense was applied: ''adept at the use of the computer, tuned into the culture of the Internet.'' In Paris, a group that had tried to launch a magazine called Electric Word was reaching for a new name for a magazine addressed to the cyberworld. Jane Metcalf said to John Rosetto, John Plunkett and Barbara Kuhr, ''Wired.'' George Shirk, editor of that successful publication's independent offshoot, Wired News, sees their role as heralds of ''the Virtual Class, people in technology, finance, marketing, media, law, politics and education who are driving the Digital Revolution.''</p>
        <p>A related sense, beyond the specific Internet culture, is ''part of a network of peole with related interests; integrated into a social set or part of an informatrix.'' A more pejorative side to this is ''set up to take advantage of high-level contacts'': a deal that is rigged, its outcome arranged beforehand not on the basis of merit or fair competition, is subject to the charge of being wired.</p>
        <p>Thus, the question ''Is he wired?'' can mean ''Is he sure to get the job?'' Or ''Is he tense, excited, on 'speed'?'' Or ''Is he au courant, with-it, where it's at?'' Or ''Is his brain's activity predetermined?'' Or ''Is he fitted with a secret microphone?'' Or ''Is he temperamentally disposed for this?'' Or ''Is he on the Net?''</p>
        <p>How will this past participle of a short verb, in future permutations, further transform its meaning and vivify our tongue? Nobody, no matter how well connected, can tell which senses will prevail and which will pass into archaisms. Stay wired.</p>
