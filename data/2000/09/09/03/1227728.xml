        <p>EVERY Grand Slam awards a silver trophy and a hefty pile of green to the player who wins seven straight matches over the course of two grueling weeks. But in front of the television or from the nosebleed seats, fans become armchair umpires of what's really in and out.  Their prize? Call it the Golden Hanger.</p>
        <p>It is only one week into the United States  Open at the National Tennis Center in Queens, but it's already game, set, match to Serena Williams, at least in terms of the  attention paid to her clothes.</p>
        <p>The spirit of Jerry Garcia clings to her chiseled body in the form of an electric-purple tie-dyed frock that has eclipsed even the red and yellow, thin-strapped numbers that turn her sister, Venus, into a flash of lightning trailing a rush of flying limbs.</p>
        <p>Serena Williams has worn two variations on the mesh outfit thus far, with sneakers to match, looking like an exuberant hostess  obviously pleased with her party dress. ''I think it is very flattering,'' she said after her first-round victory.</p>
        <p>Some fans disagree on that point, but her attire demonstrates a fashion reality: what is new is often borrowed from the past. ''I just laugh when I see her, and everybody says she's the first to do that,'' said Billie Jean King, a tennis pioneer who, like today's players, knows that entertainment is as much a part of the game as athleticism.</p>
        <p>When King won the ''Battle of the Sexes'' match against Bobby Riggs in 1973, she wore royal blue shoes to match the pattern on her white dress, created by the British-born designer Ted Tinling. ''I did it for color TV,'' King recalled. ''We didn't have color TV very long then.''</p>
        <p>Tinling was elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame for his contributions to the evolution of women's outfits. He dressed players as modern as Monica Seles and as historic as Suzanne Lenglen (who had, in 1919, shocked Wimbledon by winning with her stockings rolled down). At Wimbledon in 1949, he designed Gertrude (Gussy) Moran's lace panties, and photographers lined the court for a glimpse.</p>
        <p>Compared to that, the much-ogled Anna Kournikova seems tame this year, no longer baring her midriff, but wearing a sporty sleeveless shirt and short shorts. (The Open has no restrictions on color, as Wimbledon does, requiring mostly white clothing; by contract, women must display their sponsor patch on their tops.)</p>
        <p>As Serena Williams's bold interpretation shows, women's outfits have changed greatly since the red gingham jumper Tracy Austin wore at the United States Open in 1977, which now looks like something out of the musical ''Oklahoma.''</p>
        <p>Mary Pierce loved many of Austin's dresses, and Chris Evert's, too, which is why she agreed to incorporate the tennis dress into her own wardrobe in the early 1990's when Nike suggested it. At this United States Open, Pierce is back in a skirt, but she has earned points for creativity with the ''elastophane'' straps on her light-blue swirled top. They look like Scotch tape, but  Pierce says they are very comfortable.</p>
        <p>COMFORT was the point in one of  the game's first fashion statements, made by a man who died a week ago at the age of 94, Bunny Austin. In 1932, at a time when long flannel pants were de rigueur on the courts, Austin  arrived at the 1932 United States Championships in shorts, his bare legs bristling before the genteel spectators.</p>
        <p>Men's hemlines rose from there, going so short that when Stan Smith won Wimbledon in 1972 in shorts that neared his knees, other players commented. But after the short-short diehards Jimmy Connors and Boris Becker retired, the shorts crept back down. Then they got baggy, with Andre Agassi in denim and Pete Sampras apparently dressing for a backyard barbecue.</p>
        <p>Back when men's shorts were still rising, the shirt spectrum was expanding. Starting in the late 1960's, John Newcombe, Tony Roche and six other players known as the Handsome Eight were ordered to wear bright-colored shirts to promote World Championship Tennis, the fledgling professional tour. Pros like Stan Smith and Arthur Ashe wore pastel.</p>
        <p>These days, the men's wardrobe -- like their tour, in fact -- is not quite as dramatic as the women's. Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil  wears bright yellow and blue to honor the national colors of his country, but he lost in the first round. The defending champion, Agassi, who favors pale gray and white in his later years, lost quietly in the second.</p>
        <p>There is plenty of show left, though, from the baseline to the hemline. Even the fans who have already awarded the Golden Hanger know they have yet to see the best of the crosscourt backhands and rifled serves. Fans remember the champions for these images above all.</p>
