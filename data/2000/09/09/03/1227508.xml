        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article on the glamorization of 14th Street [''On 14th Street, Less Grit, More Glamour,'' Aug. 13] errs in its assumption that the entire surrounding population is eagerly awaiting the purge that will force out gritty and inexpensive stores and usher in luxury apartments and national chains.</p>
        <p>Like thousands of my neighbors in the Village and Chelsea -- from middle-class professionals struggling to stay in Manhattan to working-class residents of the projects in western Chelsea -- I depend on 14th Street as an affordable alternative in an area becoming overpriced and upscale to a fault.</p>

        <p>I wish that an article on 14th Street would instead celebrate such existing businesses as the invaluable Western Beef, a friendly full-service discount supermarket where my family's weekly grocery bill is almost half what it would be at my local D'Agostino's.</p>
