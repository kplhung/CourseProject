        <p>HEADLONG, by Michael Frayn. (Picador USA, $14.) The author uses his skills as a playwright to create a fast-moving internal novel about a philosopher named Martin who stumbles onto what he suspects to be an unknown Bruegel masterpiece in the home of a country gentleman. With dollar signs in his eyes, Martin plays scholarly detective to uncover the painting's provenance, hiding his scheme from his wife and gambling his career and marriage. In this ''rueful and amusing'' tale, which was chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, ''the big action is Martin turning a page -- movingly, comically, delightfully,'' Randy Cohen wrote here.</p>
        <p>DREAMING WITH HIS EYES OPEN: A Life of Diego Rivera, by Patrick Marnham. (University of California, $18.95.) The great Mexican muralist is portrayed as an amoral chameleon who managed to befriend capitalists like the Rockefellers while attacking them in his Marxist-flavored art. Last year our reviewer, Michael Kimmelman, called this an ''urbane and entertaining biography.''</p>
        <p>THE LEPER'S COMPANIONS, by Julia Blackburn. (Vintage International, $12.) In this novel, a bereaved Englishwoman retreats internally from the modern day into her same village in the year 1410, where she takes up with a band of pilgrims headed for the Holy Land. In 1999 in these pages, Bruce Bawer praised the book's ''hypnotic vision of the world's horror and beauty, banality and sacredness -- and of the frailty and splendor of the human mind.''</p>
        <p>'TIS: A Memoir, by Frank McCourt. (Touchstone/Simon &amp; Schuster, $14.) The author picks up his life story where ''Angela's Ashes'' left off, describing his journey from Ireland to New York at the age of 19 and his fitful development as son, lover, husband, writer and teacher. His ''narrative gift'' and ''spirited intelligence'' inform this ''exploration of the elusive American dream,'' Maureen Howard wrote here in 1999. '' 'Tis a success story.'' In The Great Shame: And the Triumph of the Irish in the English-Speaking World, by Thomas Keneally (Anchor, $18), the author of ''Schindler's List'' tells the story of the Irish diaspora in the 19th century, especially the thousands of men and women sent in chains to penal colonies in Australia, among them a core of political prisoners who continued to fight for an independent Ireland. The result is ''an epic tale of courage and ingenuity,'' Jay P. Dolan said here last year.</p>
        <p>DONA INES VS. OBLIVION, by Ana Teresa Torres. (Grove, $13.) Speaking to a variety of people, both living and dead, this novel's narrator tells how her cloistered life as matriarch of a wealthy Caracas family slipped into chaos and tragedy. ''Dona Ines's cranky, engaging, importuning, resentful, obsessed and relentless voice guides us through a family history that is also mired in Venezuelan history,'' John Vernon wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>HEMINGWAY: The Final Years, by Michael Reynolds. (Norton, $15.95.) In the final volume of his five-part life of Ernest Hemingway, the author, who died last month at the age of 63, describes the writer's experiences during World War II, his rocky relationship with his fourth wife, Mary Welsh, and his dependency on alcohol and prescription drugs. Last year in these pages, James Wood called this an ''excellent and exhaustive biography.''</p>
        <p>THE WAY PEOPLE RUN: Stories, by Christopher Tilghman. (Picador USA, $12.) Many of the lonely, middle-aged protagonists in these tales continue to feel the afterburn of sibling spites and other family hurts, yet are unable to match the intensity of their childhood experiences. ''Tilghman has a deft, Cheeveresque way of lending risky undertones to the rituals of suburban life,'' Rand Richards Cooper wrote in the Book Review last year. ''These are long stories'' that ''read almost like miniature novels.''</p>
        <p>CELEBRATION, U.S.A.: Living in Disney's Brave New Town, by Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins. (Owl/Holt, $15.) A correspondent for The New York Times and his wife (also a journalist) describe the mixed blessings of living with their two youngest children in Disney's micromanaged Norman Rockwell fantasyland in central Florida. Their account ''reflects a scrupulously maintained reportorial balance,'' David L. Kirp wrote here in 1999. ''Its tales of family life ring true because they are drawn directly from the authors' own experiences.''</p>
        <p>THE ELUSIVE EMBRACE: Desire and The Riddle of Identity, by Daniel Mendelsohn. (Vintage, $12.) A classical scholar explores his family's complex history and the landscape of gay and heterosexual desire. ''This charming aper--&gt;u-filled memoir is . . . a personal myth about undoing family myths,'' Jonathan Lear wrote here in 1999.''</p>
