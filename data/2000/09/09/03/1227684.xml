        <p>In a thriving economy many fashion fads are spawned but few survive past a single season. A handful, however, briefly extend their shelf life by crossbreeding. Craze in point: ID hoop earrings, a hybrid of two of last season's jewelry rages (nameplate necklaces and oversize gold hoop earrings). These are chunky, 14-karat-gold bamboo hoops with a nameplate written in cursive across the middle. They are the new hot seller at Patricia Field ($275) at 10 East Eighth Street. Laura Eisen founder of girlshop.com says she has had 150 orders for nameplate earrings since she posted them on her site a week and a half ago. At girlshop .com, the earrings cost $195 and take two weeks for delivery.</p>
