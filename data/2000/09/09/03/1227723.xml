        <p>IN a nation bent on shrinking government, no industry in the private sector generated as many new jobs over the past year as the federal government. Census takers, hired temporarily to count the population, bloated the federal payroll from the spring of last year through the spring of 2000, accounting for nearly 600,000 of 3.1 million jobs created during that period.</p>
        <p>But put aside the Census Bureau, and job creation pretty much reflected the strengths and weaknesses of an economy that has been booming for years.

        <p>IN a nation bent on shrinking government, no industry in the private sector generated as many new jobs over the past year as the federal government. Census takers, hired temporarily to count the population, bloated the federal payroll from the spring of last year through the spring of 2000, accounting for nearly 600,000 of 3.1 million jobs created during that period.</p>
        <p>But put aside the Census Bureau, and job creation pretty much reflected the strengths and weaknesses of an economy that has been booming for years. With so many couples working, the demand for day care made it the second-strongest category for job creation, although government helped here, too, subsidizing child care for women leaving welfare and taking jobs.</p>
        <p>The new economy showed up in spades, of course. Computer experts made up the category with the greatest demand. The newly wealthy -- and the big spenders among the heavy-borrowing but not so wealthy -- hired tens of thousands of gardeners, beauticians, tax preparers, photographers, laundry workers, insurance adjusters and physical therapists.</p>
        <p>Rising interest rates, though, took a toll on mortgage brokers. The crisis in Asia still made waves, too, deflating demand in that part of the world for new airliners and aircraft parts, and for workers in this industry. Mergers also shaved jobs -- among people who install cable TV wiring, for example. And productivity, or labor efficiency, cut into employment in some occupations -- typists, for example.</p>
        <p>But in this spectacular boom, the focus was on job creation, not job destruction. Managers are in great demand, to supervise all the new workers, as are public relations personnel -- to trumpet the good times.</p>
