        <p>MARIA ORTIZ-TABONE has walked out of a half-dozen computer stores empty-handed, qualifying her as either a very cautious shopper or a very frustrated one. Ms. Ortiz-Tabone, a 50-year-old real estate broker, insists she is the latter.</p>
        <p>After strolling through an OfficeMax store in Westbury the other day, she walked away without buying a notebook computer she was eyeing because the manufacturer renting space in the store had not yet staffed its kiosk.</p>
        <p>She did no better when she moved to a display of hand-held wireless computers, stumping a salesman with questions about Internet service. After the salesman moved on, she threw her hands in the air. ''You just can't get help,'' she said. ''They read from the display card.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ortiz-Tabone has turned to technical magazines to make up for the deficiency. And she has enrolled in a computer class after a day of comparison-shopping left her no better informed than when she started.</p>
        <p>She may find more classmates to commiserate with: finding a technically savvy computer sales associate is about to become even more difficult.</p>
        <p>This month's arrival of the consumer electronics chain Best Buy on the Island is likely to benefit consumers by stimulating price competition. But the dozen or so stores that Best Buy, which is based in Eden Prairie, Minn., is planning here over the next several years could stretch an already thin retail labor force, never mind one with technical skills.</p>
        <p>''Most computer salespeople don't know the difference between a microprocessor and a meat processor,'' said Jonathan Jacala, 22, a salesman at a CompUSA store in Garden City. Mr. Jacala was clearly segregating himself from the ill-equipped in his profession as he darted along the aisles seeking customers and lucrative commissions.</p>
        <p>CompUSA, which was acquired in March by the Mexican retailer Grupo Sanborns S.A., is the biggest computer specialty chain in the United States, with a long list of corporate and government customers. Best Buy, which is scheduled to open in Westbury, Bay Shore, Levittown and Setauket this fall, focuses more closely on individual sales. Jeff Morgan, an analyst at Levin Consulting in Beachwood, Ohio, which tracks the industry, said that in 1998, Best Buy sold about $400 million more in computers for home use than CompUSA did, out of Best Buy's total computer sales of $3.9 billion that year.</p>
        <p>The two chains won't battle it out alone, however. OfficeMax is next door to Best Buy's Westbury site, for instance, and within a short drive are the Wiz, RadioShack, Circuit City, P. C. Richard &amp; Son, Office Depot, Staples and independent retailers.</p>
        <p>The sweeping competition is propelling sales growth in consumer electronics past that of retailing in general, which in turn has outpaced the Island's overall economic growth, said Gary Huth, the state's labor market analyst for Long Island.</p>
        <p>''The buyers are here, the market is here, but there's a lot of competition, and that's why almost all of these national chains are late in arriving to Long Island,'' he said. ''But they all get here eventually. The market will get tighter for hiring.''</p>
        <p>Some computer retailers have left the market, but not for lack of demand. Ahron Schachter, the general manager and a vice president of DataVision Computer and Video, an independent retailer, blamed the operators of the Source Mall in Westbury for DataVision's departure last year. He said they failed to promote the mall adequately and expected tenants to pay for advertising to promote other stores.</p>
        <p>''Our exit was not because the business isn't there,'' Mr. Schachter said. ''The business is there. We just need a better location, a stand-alone store or a mall that understands what its tenants really need to do the business.''</p>
        <p>Bob Gedarovich, the manager of the mall, said it was a standard practice for tenant retailers to contribute money to market their landlords' malls. He said DataVision's lease required it to participate.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes when somebody's business doesn't turn out to be what they had hoped, they look for all sorts of reasons to assign blame,'' Mr. Gedarovich said, ''but the consumer is king and drives the business.''</p>
        <p>Another store, Tandy's giant Incredible Universe in Westbury, folded because shoppers did not accept the chain's concept of a Disney-style ''entertainment destination'' in a somewhat remote location, Mr. Morgan, the analyst, said.</p>
        <p>The loss of those retailers will be more than offset by Best Buy's arrival. And Circuit City's departure from the appliance business, which is expected to be completed in November, signals its bid for the mantle of digital retail king.</p>
        <p>But the sales staff remains an imponderable, and the demographics of suburbia make the challenge of finding skilled workers even more acute.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schachter noted that shoppers at DataVision's Long Island store needed more attention than the company's Manhattan customers.</p>
        <p>''You get the mothers with strollers looking at computers, and you need the patience to deal with that,'' he said. ''It's not like a customer who walks into the New York City store and says: 'I know the specs already. Tell me your best deal.' ''</p>
        <p>Retailers have wrestled for years with trying to figure out how many resources to devote to training specialized staff, said Ursula Moran, who follows specialty retailing for Sanford C. Bernstein, an investment research company. Profit margins in computer retail are low.</p>
        <p>Still, selling computers is becoming easier as consumers become more sophisticated. About 60 percent of American households own a personal computer, according to Gartner Dataquest, a research company, and about two-thirds are on their second or third machine.</p>
        <p>The role of sales personnel in computer stores has waned as online and other direct sales have spread. But Philip Lu, a Gartner Dataquest analyst, warned of a sizable ''group of novice users, grandpa- and grandma-type people, who want to get online. They still prefer some touch-and-feel way of buying. They're not that comfortable with the technology, and have questions.''</p>
        <p>As one path toward improving customer relations, more retailers are combining the lean direct-sales concept with their brick-and-mortar stores. Circuit City, which operates seven stores on Long Island, plans to provide in-store Web access for customers, said Bill Cimino, a store spokesman. Gateway, a leader in mail-order sales, also has stores here, but they carry no inventory and only take orders. OfficeMax rents out space in its stores to Gateway.</p>
        <p>Best Buy is a rarity because its sales force is salaried; most electronics retailers pay their sales associates by commission. But salaried sales personnel may be less aggressive, perhaps to a fault, leaving customers to their own devices when help may be preferred.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Moran, the analyst, said that Best Buy overcame problems brought on by rapid growth by investing more heavily in training. ''If you go into a Best Buy store these days,'' she said, ''you will find some qualified people.''</p>
        <p>But can Best Buy and other retailers count on finding skilled employees in the midst of one of the most severe labor shortages the Island has seen?</p>
        <p>Best Buy cast a wide net and began its recruiting drive in July 1999, and the company said it was meeting its goals of hiring up to 250 people for each of its planned stores on the Island.</p>
        <p>Adam Levin, the president of Levin Consulting, said Best Buy's employment ranks are buoyed by the salary structure and its mix of computer and music products. These draw a younger sales force, he said, compared with the career salesman more likely to be found at Circuit City or P. C. Richard.</p>
        <p>The trick is in the training. ''We've got people from our competition, from grocery stores, people in the car industry,'' said Dave Schandle, the general manager of Best Buy's Westbury store. ''I've got a stock-market analyst working for me as a part-time salesperson.''</p>
        <p>Another Best Buy strategy that has worked in other markets has been to import workers from out of state, putting them on a fast track to management in exchange for making the move, said Peter Caruso, a first vice president of Merrill Lynch in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But the resume of David Ring, the retailer's district manager -- he was a regional district manager for the Wiz and brought 15 employees to Best Buy with him -- points to the most likely source for many sales employees: competitors.</p>
        <p>The Island's high turnover rate among retail employees is borne out by statistics from Mr. Huth, the state analyst: he estimated that about 12,500 job openings a year in the sector are caused by employees' departures, while only about 2,000 openings are the result of new positions.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Jacala, the CompUSA sales associate, job security could not be stronger. ''I'm pretty sure CompUSA is the best place to work,'' he said, ''but if anything happens, there's always Best Buy.''</p>
