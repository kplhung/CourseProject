        <p>THEY look like credit cards, are accepted in almost as many places, and are now carried by tens of millions of consumers. But debit cards can turn out to be much more expensive to use for any consumer, not just a financial novice like a student. Here are some of debit cards' little-known drawbacks.</p>
        <p>Higher prices for merchandise. When you pay with a debit card, some merchants add a fee similar to an A.T.M. surcharge -- a fact that may not be posted in the store. Such surcharges are almost never imposed on credit card purchases.</p>
        <p>Holds on your checking account. When you present a debit card to initiate a purchase whose amount is not known at the outset -- like checking in at a hotel, renting a car or even filling the gas tank -- the merchant typically places a hold on your account for an amount much greater than you are likely to wind up spending. Such holds may take days to be cleared, and checks may bounce as a result, even though the money to cover them is in the account -- and you may be assessed returned-check charges that can be difficult to reverse.</p>
        <p>No proof of creditworthiness. Car rental companies may let you make a reservation and pay the bill with a debit card but still insist that you produce a credit card with adequate available credit as security before they release a car to you.</p>
        <p>Less leverage in disputes with merchants. If you use a credit card to order merchandise that never arrives or is defective, federal law offers strong protections, letting you refuse to pay until the dispute is settled. Not so with debit cards, which transfer your money to the merchant almost immediately, as if you had paid in cash.</p>
        <p>Less protection against theft. Federal law limits a consumer's maximum liability for others' fraudulent use of a credit card or card number to $50, provided that the bank is notified of the card's loss or theft within 60 days. But for a debit card, under federal law, consumers must report the theft or loss within two business days to limit the loss to $50. After that, the potential loss rises to $500, and after 60 days there is no cap -- every penny in the account and in any linked credit line is at risk. Some banks promise to extend to 60 days the reporting period for the $50 cap, but the promise has no force of law and can be withdrawn without notice.</p>
        <p>Salt-in-the-wound fees and problems. Even if you report a debit-card theft in time to be eligible, the $50 loss limit applies only to money removed from your account by the thief's actions. You can still be assessed with fees if the theft drives your balance below your account's no-fee minimum or causes checks that you have written to bounce, and those bounced checks can damage your credit standing.</p>
