        <p>Al Hirschfeld took temporary leave of Broadway this summer to embark on the QE2, where he lectured about his art, before sampling theater in several cities abroad, sketchbook in hand. His first stop was Berlin, where he saw Drew Sarich, lower left, play the title character in Disney's production of ''Der Glockner von Notre Dame'' (''The Hunchback of Notre Dame''), with a score by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, directed by James Lapine, who wrote the book. In Prague, there was ''Nachove Plachty'' (''Purple Sails''), above center, a maritime drama created and directed by Matej and Peter Forman, at the brothers' barge theater on the Moldau River. The London selections, beginning at top left, included Kathleen Turner and Matthew Rhys in ''The Graduate,'' directed by Terry Johnson; Helen Mirren in ''Orpheus Descending'' by Tennessee Williams, directed by Nicholas Hytner; Lucie Arnez, Maria Friedman and  Joanna Riding in the Cameron Mackintosh musical ''The Witches of Eastwick,'' based on John Updike's novel, with music by Dana P. Rowe, book and lyrics by John Dempsey, directed by Eric Schaeffer; and Sean Campion and Conleth Hill in the comedy ''Stones in His Pockets'' by Marie Jones, directed by Ian McElhinney.</p>
