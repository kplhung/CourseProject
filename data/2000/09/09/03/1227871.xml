        <p>Remember the incident in which Representative Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat from Southern California's 46th Congressional District, took so much heat over scheduling a fund-raiser at the Los Angeles Playboy Mansion that she retreated to an innocuous film studio hall -- and then  withdrew in a huff as a Democratic National Convention speaker?</p>

        <p>Remember the incident in which Representative Loretta Sanchez, a Democrat from Southern California's 46th Congressional District, took so much heat over scheduling a fund-raiser at the Los Angeles Playboy Mansion that she retreated to an innocuous film studio hall -- and then  withdrew in a huff as a Democratic National Convention speaker?</p>
        <p>Comes now Playboy redux . . .</p>
        <p>Christie Hefner, Hugh's daughter and chief executive of Playboy Enterprises, is helping Gov. Mel Carnahan of Missouri, a moderate Democrat, raise money for his effort to unseat Senator John Ashcroft, a freshman Republican and hard-right Christian conservative. Mr. Ashcroft says Mr. Carnahan is ''chasing sex money'' and has demanded that he cut his ties to Ms. Hefner and give back any money raised by her.</p>
        <p>Such an unholy alliance, the senator contends, is ''an insult to the values of every Missouri family that wants to protect its children from the pornography pushed into their homes by outfits like Playboy.''</p>
        <p>The governor's reply: He'll keep any money collected with Ms. Hefner because there is ''nothing scandalous'' about it. He says the senator  should ''come down off his high horse and stop his sanctimonious, negative and hypocritical smear campaign.''</p>
        <p>And Ms. Hefner?</p>
        <p>She says she does not presume that Mr. Carnahan's acceptance of her support represents a Playboy endorsement but she does presume that ''the overwhelming majority of Missourians know Playboy as a magazine of high editorial quality.''</p>
        <p>The race is tight, regarded as one of the three or four most crucial to control of the Senate. The sex-and-money angle has captured some headlines but there is no real indication of how it is playing with voters.</p>
