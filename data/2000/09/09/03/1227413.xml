        <p>Modern Art</p>
        <p>By Evelyn Toynton.</p>
        <p>182 pp. Harrison, N.Y.:</p>
        <p>Delphinium Books. $22.</p>
        <p>GOSSIPY and insinuating, the roman  clef persuades us to read it differently from ordinary novels. Its invitation to surrender and lose ourselves in a dream world created by the writer is more ironic, less genuine and ultimately less convincing than those we are accustomed to receive from more purely imaginative fictions. For the roman  clef acknowledges how frequently we will be disturbed and jarred awake from the dream of art by the nagging, inescapable question of reality: How much of this story is true?</p>
        <p>When the narrative arc of a novel closely parallels the biography of a historical subject, the writer's fantasy and powers of invention cannot be deployed in the usual ways. And it is difficult for fictional characters to take on lives of their own when those lives have already been lived by their real-life models. Of course, a genius like Proust can populate a masterpiece with identifiable contemporaries, but more often, the rewards of such reading are likely to be those of a slightly trashy literary guessing game. That child actress turned pill freak with the big voice and the gay husband -- isn't that Judy Garland?</p>
        <p>Evelyn Toynton's first novel, ''Modern Art,'' is a good deal better than that, despite the fact that its central character bears a more than passing resemblance to Lee Krasner, the painter known also as the long-suffering wife -- and later the widow -- of Jackson Pollock. Indeed, the book's milieu and details read like the material for a brief course on the lives of the famous couple: the notably homely Jewish artist who betrays her own talent to nurture the depressive, badly behaved alcoholic genius, who repays the favor by killing himself in a drunken car wreck that his pretty young mistress survives. The wife (here called Belle Prokoff) also survives to fiercely guard the legend of the great man (here named Clay Madden), to say nothing of his hugely valuable and avidly sought-after estate.</p>
        <p>The supporting cast is familiar as well. There is a character who suggests the critic Clement Greenberg, another whose history resembles Peggy Guggenheim's and, unsurprisingly, the once-attractive mistress who has lost her looks but still clings to the secret of what happened on the night of the fatal auto accident. (In reality, so dependably and deplorably less glorious than fiction, Pollock's mistress wrote a book about their affair and the crash.) Most problematic, there is the novel's least felicitous creation, a figure known to us not so much from life as from other books and films: the cold-blooded biographer, bent on digging up dirt, whose coercive, unethical snooping pushes the plot toward its dramatic conclusion.</p>
        <p>What is surprising, then, is how Toynton has taken the recipe for a literary disaster and managed to cook up something quite presentable and lively. And what is equally unpredictable is how the book keeps you reading contentedly, even after (or especially after) you have figured out that it has no startlingly new insights to offer, either about Lee Krasner or about its larger themes: art, sex, power, commerce, memory, love and the reasons women habitually choose to sacrifice themselves and their talents on the altar of male creativity.</p>
        <p>One reason ''Modern Art'' works as well as it does is that Toynton manages to keep the action moving along at an admirably brisk pace. The plot moves back and forth from present to past, the point of view skips deftly from character to character so that the narrative is divided among the book's men and women -- a remarkably populous crew for such a relatively short novel.</p>
        <p>By far the most appealing and accessible character is a young woman named Lizzie, a graduate student who, for complicated reasons, signs on as a live-in assistant to care for the ailing Belle, who is suffering from severe arthritis and worrisome dizzy spells. Much about Lizzie's present situation parallels her employer's past. She too is in love with an essentially self-absorbed painter, though little suggests that her sweetheart, Paul Doherty, possesses anything remotely akin to Clay Madden's genius. When he is not sending Lizzie the sort of signals that would cause a more savvy or less infatuated woman to cut her losses and leave him, Paul is hanging out in a fashionably grubby bar with his artist buddies, who while away the hours (during which they could more profitably be painting) griping about their demanding girlfriends and the corruption and iniquities of the art world:</p>
        <p>''All over the city, they were placing their livers in jeopardy -- aging graduates of Pratt and Cooper Union and RISD, ex-scholarship students all, the sons of farmers and factory workers and traffic cops back in Racine. Their skin was an unhealthy gray, their hands outsized for their bodies. . . . Haranguing the powers that be, they saw themselves as outsiders, persecuted rebels, and yet they were reactionaries, sons of the laboring classes aligned unwittingly with the oppressor. They were protesting the decline of standards, the erosion of an ancient, elite art under attack for excluding the masses.''</p>
        <p>What this passage should make clear is that Toynton can write intelligently, which is, finally, the main reason ''Modern Art'' transcends the limitations of the roman  clef and maintains a steady hold on the reader's attention. For the most part, her prose is sharp, uncluttered by needless adornment, serviceable and even, on occasion, elegant -- an increasingly rare phenomenon. It is style (perhaps more than substance) that makes Toynton's perceptions seem sharp and fresh, as in this description of the eager students who interrogate Belle about her late husband and his work:</p>
        <p>''Twenty years ago, they would have been wearing fuzzy angora sweaters. Now they are dressed like torturers' apprentices, in multiple earrings and studded leather jackets, but with the same blond cleanliness, that air of shining mental hygiene produced by a certain kind of affluent childhood.''</p>
        <p>Such sentences enable us to take pleasure in reading a story that, at least in outline, we already know, and to remain engaged until the novel's final pages. Toynton is obviously gifted, and you finish ''Modern Art'' eager to find out what she will do when she learns to rely less on the facts of biography and to explore and trust the capacities of her own observation and imagination.</p>
