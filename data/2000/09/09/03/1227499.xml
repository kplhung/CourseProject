        <p>A Labor Day parade will begin tomorrow at the American Labor Museum in Hale don, which was the rallying point for 24,000 striking silk workers in 1913, and end at the Great Falls in Paterson, the first planned industrial city in the United States.</p>

        <p>A Labor Day parade will begin tomorrow at the American Labor Museum in Hale don, which was the rallying point for 24,000 striking silk workers in 1913, and end at the Great Falls in Paterson, the first planned industrial city in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Botto House, site of the museum, represents workers' struggle for rights, like an eight-hour day, health benefits and retirement plans. The museum, at 83 Norwood Street, is open free of charge from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday and by appointment. Information is available at (973) 595-7953.</p>
        <p>Bunny Kuiken, granddaughter of Pietro and Maria Botto, who turned their property over to the strikers, talked recently about the home.</p>
        <p>Q. What were Paterson and Haledon like at the turn of the century?</p>
        <p>A. There were 292 silk factories in Paterson and others in Clifton and elsewhere around here. They created power from the falls, which are 77 feet high. Haledon was a suburb.</p>
        <p>The silk workers worked 55 hours a week and children as young as 9 worked. There were no safety precautions. The 1913 strike started spontaneously in Clifton when a factory owner wanted to bring in a loom system that would have put many workers out of jobs. It spread to the other factories until there were 24,000 people on strike.</p>
        <p>Q. Why did your grandparents' home become a center for the strike?</p>
        <p>A. The police in Paterson were sympathetic to the mill owners and they would disperse or arrest the strikers when they tried to gather there, so they came across the city line into Haledon, where the mayor was sympathetic to the workers and the town only had one police officer. My grandfather, who worked in the silk factory, offered his home for the Sunday rallies.</p>
        <p>Q. Who led the strike?</p>
        <p>A. The Industrial Workers of the World, or Wobblies, came here in an effort to establish a foothold on the East Coast. The journalist Jack Reed spoke from this balcony, as did I.W.W. leaders Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Hubert Henry Harrison and Big Bill Haywood. They had speakers from Europe talk to the crowds in different languages because there were German, Dutch and Italian immigrants among the strikers.</p>
        <p>The bosses tried to start rumors, saying a certain immigrant group had gone back to work. But if they had been to the rallies in Haledon, they knew the truth.</p>
        <p>Q. What happened with the strike?</p>
        <p>A. The strike lasted seven months and there were no strike benefits back then. Eventually the workers went back, one factory at a time. They lost the strike, although the things they were striking for -- child labor laws, an eight-hour day, safety measures -- were eventually won.</p>
        <p>Q. What do the strike and labor movement mean to people now?</p>
        <p>A. People don't know about the unions and what they accomplished. Children now should know what their grandparents and great-grandparents went through and why they now have an eight-hour day and all the other benefits.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you have any problems establishing the museum?</p>
        <p>A. After the strike, no one would talk about it for many years. We never remember my grandfather working again after that. He was probably blackballed. When I started to try to gather information in 1973, many of the older people still refused to talk about it, partially because many of the radicals involved in the strike were socialists or communists.</p>
        <p>But eventually we found a lot of people who had pictures of the strikers and the silk factories, which started to die out in the 1940's when synthetic fabrics came along. We opened in 1983.</p>
