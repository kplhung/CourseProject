        <p>NEW Year's Day has the reputation for renewal, for being the time when we take stock and set goals and cast off bad habits and worn-out socks. But thinking people know that the true moment for such stuff is now, when summer gives way to fall.

        <p>That is what we hope to do in this column -- regird, that is, not play football. We hope to A.) tie up a loose end, B.) set our sights on new mysteries that need conquering, and C.) offer nominations for things that should be thrown out along with those old socks.</p>

        <p>NEW Year's Day has the reputation for renewal, for being the time when we take stock and set goals and cast off bad habits and worn-out socks. But thinking people know that the true moment for such stuff is now, when summer gives way to fall. The three-month-vacation mind-set is reluctantly jettisoned, a collective deep breath is taken, and we all regird our loins, figuratively speaking, except for those of us who play football for a living.</p>
        <p>That is what we hope to do in this column -- regird, that is, not play football. We hope to A.) tie up a loose end, B.) set our sights on new mysteries that need conquering, and C.) offer nominations for things that should be thrown out along with those old socks.</p>
        <p>In the loose ends department, we offer one last look at the Great $20 Giveaway. In June, you'll recall, we spread five $20 bills around and asked the finders to tell us how they spent the money. Then, last month, we harshly, indeed rudely, scolded the entire state because none of the finders had played along. This caused two things to happen:</p>
        <p>1. Several smart alecks we know suggested, rightly, that the only numbskull in the story was the one who had frittered away $100.</p>
        <p>2. Amy Ryan sent us a letter. Ms. Ryan, who now lives in North Carolina but until a few weeks ago lived in Princeton Junction, confessed to finding the $20 we had left at the Plainsboro Public Library. She would have written sooner, she said, but, well, there was the small chore of moving. She said the column containing our scolding had shamed her into finally telling her tale, which turns out to have an astonishing twist.</p>
        <p>''My daughter Bailey (7) and I read about the hunt early that Saturday morning, and just as we were getting ready to leave for Plainsboro, Bailey's grandfather, Frank Ryan from Whiting, called to let us know about it, too,'' she wrote. ''We ran right in as the doors opened and found the book and the bill after a bit of fevered hunting.''</p>
        <p>Here's the eerie part: In delivering our scolding, we had suggested that a good place to send found money was the Popcorn Park Zoo, which takes in abused animals. The Ryans, incredibly, reported that they had already given the $20 to the zoo, even before reading that advice. Our head has been spinning at this coincidence ever since.</p>
        <p>Which ends the $20 Giveaway tale and leads into part two of today's column: shocking and unexplained things that we think someone, perhaps even us, should investigate now that vacation season is over:</p>
        <p>1. A few days ago we came home to find a message on the answering machine from a worker at Newark Airport. He advised that the turtles we had just picked up at the airport had not been cleared by government inspectors and should immediately be brought back. We're fairly sure this man dialed our number by mistake, since we can't recall picking up any turtles at the airport, and that's the kind of thing we generally remember. Questions have been nagging us ever since. Is whoever did pick up the turtles still walking around with them, endangering the public in untold ways? Who inspects turtles and for what? Why didn't the caller from the airport leave a number?</p>
        <p>2. On the Northeast Corridor rail line near Linden, a half-dozen tracks run parallel. Someone has discarded a rather bulky typewriter there -- not on the edge of the track bed, where most litter lives, but between tracks four and five. Every time we zip by this typewriter, we want to know more. Did someone really tiptoe across several live train tracks to deposit it there? Did a frustrated writer heave it out the window of a train? If so, how, since train windows don't open?</p>
        <p>3. Recently we got a call asking if we would participate in a French-fry taste test. This was serious business and we had to sign a confidentiality agreement, which is why you will not read whose fries were being tested, but we will reveal that the testers asked: ''Were the fries too potatoey, not potatoey enough, or just right?'' We were astounded. Who knew there were degrees of potatoeyness? Are there also degrees of tomatoeyness and carrotyness?</p>
        <p>So we have plenty to ponder as we exit summer and wade back into the workaday world. To free up brain cells for this pondering, we have vowed to devote no more mental energy to a dozen or so worn-out subjects, these among them: Cell phone etiquette. ''Survivors.'' Those fiberglass cows. The frisking photograph. The weather.</p>
        <p>We suggest you make a similar list as part of your regirding process. And you with the turtles: turn yourself in. You know who you are.</p>
