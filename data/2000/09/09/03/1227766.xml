        <p>In a sudden midnight raid, nearly 200 riot police surrounded the car where Myanmar's pro-democracy leader had been stranded by the roadside for a week and forced her and her companions to return home, one of her aides said today.</p>
        <p>A Western diplomat said security forces then sealed off the political headquarters of the leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and apparently searched it and removed documents.</p>
        <p>The forceful action brought to an abrupt end an attempt by Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, 55, to publicize the restrictions on her political movement by attempting to drive from the capital of the former Burma to meet with her supporters in another town.</p>
        <p>Her two-car convoy, in which she was accompanied by 14 supporters, was halted -- as similar forays have been in the past -- creating a standoff in the small town of Dala, just south of the capital, Yangon.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi refused to leave her car and set up camp by the side of the road. Her party, the National League for Democracy, issued a statement saying she would hold out ''until she reaches her destination and accomplishes her party organizational duties.''</p>
        <p>Her aide, U Tin Oo, told reporters that he assumed she had been returned to her home. But his interview with local reporters was cut short before he could say much more.</p>
        <p>''Around midnight, nearly 200 riot police raided the place where we were staying and forcibly took Aung San Suu Kyi and all of us,'' said Mr. Tin Oo, who is her chief deputy as party leader.</p>
        <p>Party officials could not be reached by telephone today.</p>
        <p>Though Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi failed, as expected, to meet with her supporters, her attempt succeeded in reviving international attention to the suppression of her political rights. It drew statements of concern from several nations as well as from the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan.</p>
        <p>Myanmar's military leaders accused her of a political stunt in advance of a session this month of the United Nations General Assembly and a meeting in December at which the main European and Southeast Asian political groupings are expected to discuss their relations with Myanmar.</p>
        <p>Both the European Union and the most liberal member of the Asian grouping, Thailand, issued statements criticizing the government's actions.</p>
        <p>In a statement today, the Myanmar government maintained its somewhat mocking tone toward the standoff, which it has portrayed as a pleasant outing in the countryside.</p>
        <p>Under the headline, ''Dala Incident Ends Happily,'' it said: ''Daw Suu Kyi, her travel companions and all their attendants arrived home safe and sound this morning after their eight days of stay in Dala town.''</p>
        <p>Noting that her party had complained of the conditions in the swampy and mosquito-ridden area, the statement said: ''The government acknowledged their complaints and on Sept. 2 at 1:30 a.m., Daw Suu Kyi and her travel companions were escorted back to their respective residences in Yangon in a motorcade facilitated by the government for their safe and convenient return.''</p>
        <p>The standoff was the latest confrontation between Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi and the military junta that took power in 1988 after suppressing a nationwide pro-democracy uprising.</p>
        <p>She was placed under house arrest the next year, but her party overwhelmingly won a parliamentary election in 1990, only to see the government set aside the results and remain in power. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.</p>
        <p>She was released from house arrest in 1995, but her activities since then have remained severely curtailed, and she has not been permitted to travel outside the capital, formerly known as Rangoon.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, called on the government to try to resolve the long-running political stalemate through negotiations.</p>
        <p>''The secretary general believes that the latest situation underlines the necessity for national reconciliation and urges the two sides to engage, as soon as possible, in a substantive political dialogue,'' said Mr. Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard.</p>
        <p>But in a series of statements, Myanmar's leaders maintained their hard line against her.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Foreign Minister U Win Aun portrayed Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi's action in sinister terms, saying she hoped to draw an aggressive response from her foreign supporters.</p>
        <p>''What she would like to see is the government to arrest her, thinking her arrest could create anarchy in the country, and eventually expecting foreign intervention,'' he said.</p>
