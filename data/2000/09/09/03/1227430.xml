        <p>THERE is one travel perk that no one talks about. Among the various acceptable reasons for taking a trip -- business, family obligation, vacation, spiritual growth -- is a compelling, seldom acknowledged motive: having the world's most perfect excuse at your fingertips. Travel can get you out of virtually anything.</p>
        <p>I had my very own travel dodge epiphany on the way home from a business trip in Denver. I arrived at the airport early only to discover that because of bad weather, most of the flights, including mine, had been delayed by about two hours. Once my initial disgust and frustration -- not to mention airport claustrophobia, which for me kicks in the moment there is the possibility of a protracted stay -- had faded to an endurable level of annoyance, I made my way to a phone to cancel a dinner appointment I knew I was not going to make.</p>
        <p>After I hung up the phone, I started thinking about some work that I hadn't finished, a story that was due in several days' time. I picked up the telephone again and dialed my editor.</p>
        <p>''Listen, it looks as if I am going to be stuck here overnight,'' I heard myself saying, ''so I am going to need an extension on that piece I promised you.'' It was only a small exaggeration, I told myself.</p>
        <p>Feeling half-guilty, half-victorious, I glanced around. Then it struck me: everyone was doing it. On cell phones and pay phones throughout the airport, people were in an absolute frenzy of canceling, postponing, delaying, deferring. You could feel it in the air. You could see it in their eyes. They were all using this relatively minor travel mishap to get out of everything they possibly could.</p>
        <p>On a more enlightened planet we wouldn't need to prevaricate. We could tell our bosses we haven't finished our work and that's that. We could tell our in-laws we don't feel like coming to their house for dinner, period. We could tell the parents of our kids' school friends we would never under any circumstances want to spend a weekend at the beach with them. Unfortunately, the world in which we live requires a little more delicacy and often a lot more deception. It requires dodging.</p>
        <p>Travel is the caviar of dodges. There is a certain mystique surrounding it. People who travel are important, not to be messed with, not to be questioned. Travel plans are considered somehow sacred -- unchangeable, unimpeachable. Talk of a trip dazzles and distracts the listener. ''You're going to China next week? Wow! Of course you can't play tennis with me today.''</p>
        <p>By all accounts the most common form of the travel dodge is simply fibbing about the dates or times of your itinerary. This evasion ranges from the innocuous ''We got in unbelievably late last night,'' or ''I think we might be away that weekend,'' to the more daring technique of padding your trip -- that is, adding a fictitious day or two onto either end. If the baby shower is on a Sunday, you're not getting home until late Sunday night; if the budget meeting is on Friday afternoon, your flight leaves Friday morning.</p>
        <p>Almost everyone has used this technique at one time or another to dodge disagreeable functions. As lies go, it's so white it's a bleached blonde.</p>
        <p>It may sound super-sneaky, but folks who are really desperate for peace and quiet sometimes fake a trip entirely -- call it  Virtual Travel. (Instructions: Tell everyone you are going away for the weekend. Stock up on food, books and videos. Unplug the phone, and don't answer the door. Be sure to make all outgoing calls from your cell phone.)</p>
        <p>Occasionally I have been caught pretending to be out of town and have resorted to the self-effacing absent-minded professor gambit: ''Did I say I was going away this weekend? Gosh, I don't even know what month it is these days!''</p>
        <p>A more subtle version of travel dodging exploits issues surrounding the trip, rather than the trip itself. Preparations for trips come under this heading. You can be packing, doing errands, resting up, saving money -- which, of course, precludes your spending money on something you secretly wish to avoid anyway.</p>
        <p>Depending on your destination, your preparations can even incapacitate you. A man I know who was going to Vietnam was required to take a malarial drug for several weeks in advance. Since this drug is known to cause hallucinations in a small percentage of people, he was able to plead temporary insanity to everything inappropriate he did during that month. (I never could get him to reveal exactly what it was he got away with.)</p>
        <p>By far the king of the classic dodges is travel recovery. Whatever state of physical impairment you claim, it is always believable. Jet lag and the postflight cold are standards. (Strangely, a cold caught while traveling garners more sympathy than one caught at home.) If you have traveled somewhere exotic like Turkey or Kazakhstan, you could easily have picked up all manner of nasty bugs. You may be able to remain under the weather for months. Even when you travel domestically you can come home with parasites, food poisoning, blisters, bug bites or sunburn. I tend to have trouble with my ears when I fly; useful if I need a slowdown subterfuge.</p>
        <p>But it is when you find yourself in serious trouble -- such as when you have failed to show up for an important meeting, forgotten a dinner where you were an honored guest, or arrived late at your brother's wedding -- that you need a more drastic remedy.</p>
        <p>Enter the travel disaster story. Your disaster never involves any actual injuries, but still elicits sympathy and can even entertain as it serves as your alibi: ''The train lost all power. There was no air-conditioning. They shut down the cafe car, and we were stuck in the Channel tunnel for two and a half hours!'' After all, who hasn't been trapped in a train, bumped off a flight, stuck in an airport, had their luggage lost, been rerouted to another city or had something horrible spilled on him by a seat mate?</p>
        <p>In short, the travel dodge is a multi purpose defense weapon. There are many more I could tell you about. But I'm afraid I've got to run; there is an airport limo waiting for me downstairs this very minute. Oh, and by the way, I'm going to be gone for a long, long time.</p>
