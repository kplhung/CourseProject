        <p>A plan by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin of France to give limited self-rule to the island of Corsica has caused turmoil in France's political class and led Interior Minister Jean Pierre Chevenement to resign in protest.</p>
        <p>Any degree of regional autonomy is a deeply sensitive constitutional issue in France. But the plan has also gained wide backing, including from Corsicans, because it aims to strengthen moderates and end the violent campaign of separatists, who have thrown bombs and practiced political killings for almost three decades.</p>
