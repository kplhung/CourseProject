        <p>PFIZER'S bright, new Learning Center here is being lined with art, both two-  and three-dimensional.</p>
        <p>Katie Gass, of Rye Brook, who is a professional organizer of exhibitions and collections, is responsible for the installation and has made many of the selections. No newcomer to the world of corporate collecting, she began her career as the registrar of the Chase Bank collection, and for seven years she was the director of the Curt Marcus Gallery in SoHo in Manhattan before going out on her own.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gass was interviewed as she was supervising the hanging of the art on the building's walls, some of them painted a paprika red.</p>
        <p>Q. Can you give a brief description of the collection?</p>
        <p>A. The overall theme of the collection is ''Bringing the Outside In.'' It's 97 pieces by 54 artists, and the artists all live in Westchester. Investing in local talent was a decision made early, about a year and a half ago by Ingrid Fox, who is Pfizer's art curator, and by Jayne H. Baum, a private art dealer in Manhattan. The youngest artist is, I would say, on the cusp of 30, and the oldest is in his 70's. One of the nice things about this collection is that it is relatively inexpensive. In New York City you could get only one or two major works for what we paid for the whole thing.</p>
        <p>Q. How did you go about choosing the work?</p>
        <p>A. Through slides but mainly through studio visits. I love the world of ideas that's present in an artist's studio. It's like walking into a book. And that world is different with each artist. Artists are terrible editors of their own work. They usually bring out too many pieces; it reminds me of a sample sale sometimes. It's the curator's job to pick the best out of the many samples they show. I confined my choices to very recent works, although some of the photographs are a bit earlier.</p>
        <p>Q. Was it a challenge deciding where the art should go?</p>
        <p>A. I had a floor plan, and I could have worked from it at home until I was blue in the face. But I knew from experience that you can't really make any decisions until the pieces are actually there, leaning against the walls. If an artist has more than one work, I tried to keep those works together. One of my other rules was to try and have all the frames in a grouping the same color. We framed the work in three kinds of frames: black, cherry wood and a simple unvarnished one. But there's a saying among those who work with art, ''The window always wins,'' and this building has many panoramic views onto the natural landscape that art just can't compete with.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there any placements that you're especially proud of?</p>
        <p>A. I like seeing the painting ''Red Ginger'' with its bold red bud right when you enter the building. It's a big painting by Deborah Brown, who lives in Larchmont. The large, complex black-and-white ink drawings by Creighton Michael of Mount Kisco look great on the red wall. So does the pastel diptych by Herb Youner from Peekskill. He visits Cuba a lot, and this work has a bright Caribbean color scheme. Daniel Kazamerski from Hastings-on-Hudson used a pinhole camera for bluish Cynotypes of items found in kitchens or in restaurants, and they look like they're from a bygone era. They're hung in the employee kitchen area here at Pfizer.</p>
        <p>Q. How do the people who work here like what you're doing?</p>
        <p>A. They were at the forefront of my thinking when I was choosing work and planning the installation. After all, they're the ones who are going to be living with it day after day. I understand how resentment can build when the employees' sensibilities aren't taken into account. But the response has been overwhelmingly positive. People from all levels of employment come to me with comments and suggestions. Just this afternoon someone didn't like what she would have to look at all the time. I'll change it, or else leave that portion of the wall blank.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you learn anything from this project?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. One important thing was the realization that some of the older artists perfected their vision or style in the 50's, and they still work that way. Often their work has a lot of bright color that comes right out at you. I see it as related to Synchronism, a movement which seriously investigated abstraction and color. This kind of art is usually dismissed as passe in the contemporary art world, but through working with it I've found it can be quite beautiful. Can I say how incredibly lovely I found these artists to be? They were exceptionally accommodating. In Manhattan you often have to assume a bended-knee position with artists, even if they're young.</p>
        <p>Q. Did you ever want to be an artist?</p>
        <p>A. I actually majored in painting in college, but I gave it up when I realized how much better other artists were. Besides, I didn't like the idea of working alone in a studio. There's no one to talk to.</p>
