        <p>AS telecommunications companies lease and modify space for their special needs and for the elaborate specialized pieces of equipment that are the backbone and nerves of electronic commerce, landlords and brokers are adapting some of their ways of doing business to adjust to the new conditions.</p>
        <p>Because of their need to have an extraordinarily high level of reliability, the telecommunications companies are installing their own backup systems, including batteries, generators and air conditioning equipment that are independent of the systems already working in buildings. And they are changing established landlord-tenant relationships, including which party makes decisions and who controls parts of a property.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications sites are becoming a significant factor in the commercial real estate industry. According to a survey conducted by Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the real estate services company, 4.9 million square feet of space has been leased or purchased by these companies in the metropolitan New York region in the last two and a half years.</p>
        <p>Because the telecommunications industry is the basis for the new Internet economy,  the penalties for an operating failure are severe. As a result, technical experts are being given greater control of lease negotiations than in the past, observed Jeffrey Bernstein, a managing director of Insignia/ESG, the real estate services company.</p>
        <p>''About two years ago I began to notice that the deals were driven by the technical guys, not the financial guys, '' said Mr. Bernstein, who has specialized in telecommunications leases.</p>
        <p>''These companies absolutely do not want to go dark, and so they rely on cautious engineers,'' he said. ''You find yourself in a conference room with three technical guys across the table negotiating a lease.'' Knowing they will be blamed if the system crashes makes the engineers all the more careful, he said.</p>
        <p>The emphasis on reliability has also led tenants to insist on more control of their own spaces. In the past, tenants shared the electrical and mechanical systems installed by a landlord in a building. Today, telecommunications companies want their own generators, cooling systems, fuel tanks and pumping systems independent of other tenants and the landlord.</p>
        <p>Indeed, one of the marketing points for a new telecommunications building on 57th Street between 11th and 12th Avenues proposed by the Durst Organization is that it will have multiple risers -- vertical shafts that rise through the building -- and that tenants will have independent access to the risers without having to go through another tenant's space. And telecommunications companies want to do the work themselves, not being willing to allow a landlord to do anything that might compromise their reliability and independence. ''In the early telecom deals, the landlords did the work and not everybody was happy,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''Now the tenants do the work, which is a big change. In the old days, the landlords would never let a tenant anywhere near a riser or anything vertical.''</p>
        <p>The new building proposed by the Dursts is an indication of how the needs of high-tech tenants are changing the way buildings are being designed. Instead of uniform floors, the structure is to be replete with special zones. There is a mechanical equipment zone on each floor and a roof equipment zone at the top of the six-story building. Inside there are multiple riser shafts to distribute electrical power, telecommunications cable, fuel oil and coolant from the basement to the upper floors.</p>
        <p>The zones are being designed into the building to support the tenants the Dursts are hoping to attract, which are primarily machines and only incidentally people. Named the NYCyberCenter, the building is intended to house the powerful computers and switching equipment that are essential to the growth of commerce on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>''This is a new type of building, like 4 Times Square,'' said Douglas Durst, the president of the Durst Organization, referring to the Conde Nast building on Broadway between 42nd and 43rd Streets. While the office building was designed to be environmentally correct and includes two fuel cells to provide independent electrical power, the Cybercenter is being designed for e-commerce.</p>
        <p>''Web hosting is a high margin business,'' said Robert Stella, a senior vice president of  CB Richard Ellis, the real estate services firm representing the Dursts on the 57th Street project, ''and it is linked to the growth of business-to-business and that is what this building is intended for.''</p>
        <p>''These companies expect to be billing $1 million a minute when they are operating,'' or more than $500 billion a year, said Richard A. Romm, a senior principal in SCR Design Organization, citing a commonly used estimate of the industry's potential revenues. . ''That is a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>When older buildings are modified to host telecommunications and Web hosting companies, the requirements are usually similar: multiple sources of electrical and communications cables to lower the chance of an interruption in service. And, even though Consolidated Edison is one of the most reliable utilities in the country because its cables are buried underground rather than hanging overhead, most installations include batteries and generators as additional backups.</p>
        <p>''These guys want a belt and suspender, and then they add more belts,'' one real estate executive commented.</p>
        <p>The electrical demands of the densely packed ranks of telecommunications equipment means that landlords are being forced to provide power in amounts scarcely contemplated just a few years ago. Durst has said its new building will be equipped to deliver 100 watts of power per square foot, compared with 5 or 7 seven watts per square foot in a typical new office building.</p>
        <p>More power means more heat, which means these buildings will have to be cooled even on the coldest day in winter. Last weekend, at another ''telecom hotel,'' cooling towers were lifted for installation on the roof and setbacks of the old AT&amp;T building at 32 Avenue of the Americas, just south of Canal Street. One floor of the building, the 15th, has been reinforced and modified to house diesel-powered generators that will be used to keep the telecommunications companies that are moving into the space given up by AT&amp;T in operation if something happens to public utilities.</p>
        <p>''These are 24/7 businesses, 365 days a year,'' said John J. Gilbert, chief operating officer for Rudin Management, which owns and manages the building, using the current term for around-the-clock operations. Indeed, this invasion of technology is prompting the use of terms not previously common in real estate circles. He said the telecommunications companies are seeking ''five nines'' reliability, which means that they are trying to find ways to be in operation 99.999 percent of the time.</p>
        <p>ANOTHER term being used is ''N plus one systems.'' This means if a tenant needs three generators to sustain operations in the event of a power failure, it should install four, the amount needed plus one. ''The idea is that you can keep running even if there is a failure in your own system, in addition to electrical grid,'' said Richard T. Kennedy, a senior director of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a real estate services company.</p>
        <p>''If you need three generators, install four, if you need three cooling towers, install four,'' he said. ''That way if the power goes out, and you have to take one of your own units off line for maintenance, you can still keep operating.''</p>
        <p>Some companies have gone beyond ''N plus one'' to what is called a ''2 N system'' where the backup system is itself completely backed up. ''Some installations have put in two complete systems, each capable of handling the load,'' said Julius Bogad, a partner at Jaros, Baum &amp; Bolles, a consulting engineering firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy is representing Bush Terminal, a five million square foot collection of 12 multifloor warehouses on the Brooklyn waterfront. The owner, Industry City Associates, is seeking to transform two of the buildings into a telecommunications center. Plans call for the installation of backup generators on the space behind the buildings where railroad lines once brought cargo from the docks to the city.</p>
        <p>Putting the generators outside on platforms, instead of on a special floor in a building or on the roof, takes advantage of something that is more available in Brooklyn than Manhattan: open space. ''There is no land area in Manhattan,'' said Bruce B. Federman, a partner in Industry City Associates. ''We have the land, so we can be more flexible.'' Using outside space avoids the expense of preparing a floor inside for the heavy, vibrating machines, and there is also no need to replace windows with louvers to secure an air supply for the diesel engines that run the machines and piping to vent the exhaust outside.</p>
        <p>Other telecommunications projects in New York include a building at 85 10th Avenue at 15th Street, which is being adapted for Level 3 Communications, and 636 11th Avenue at 46th Street, which is to be occupied by Global Crossing Ltd. Another is a former tire parts factory at 470 Vanderbilt Avenue in Brooklyn, which is being developed for multiple tenants by the Carlyle Group of Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>Another center is the old Western Union Building at 60 Hudson Street, between Worth and Thomas Streets in TriBeCa. This was one of the first buildings in Manhattan to be converted to house modern communications equipment, and brokers say some of the decisions made there offer a guide for subsequent conversions.</p>
        <p>''Not everybody has space to install generators, but the need to be in the building to interconnect with other companies is so great that some tenants are willing to sacrifice reliability,'' said John Peters, a former broker with Cushman &amp; Wakefield, who now operates Technology Real Estate. He said landlords now establish master plans for buildings to ensure that all tenants have equal access to space for installation of generators, coolers, antennas and fuel tanks.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications companies are choosing old industrial buildings today because of their ability to carry heavy loads and other practical considerations, rather than the prestige of the address. Mr. Stella of CB Richard Ellis said this reflects the maturity of the industry. ''Eight or nine years ago these companies wanted to be in Class A or B buildings to give the impression they were established,'' he said. ''But today it does not make any sense to pay $80 or $90 a square foot to house equipment.''</p>
        <p>Brokers say space in Manhattan for telecommunications installations ranges from the mid to high $40's per square foot annually, with space in other boroughs and suburbs renting for about half that amount.</p>
        <p>One of the early tenants at Bush Terminal is Winstar Wireless, a long distance carrier. Algis Butkus, the company's senior manager for construction, said the systems being installed now at telecommunications centers are an extension of the backups that kept voice systems working during power failures.</p>
        <p>''With the voice system we had batteries as a backup, and we never lost telephone service,'' he said. ''Now we are taking it farther with the additional cooling and generators. You don't want all your eggs in one basket.''</p>
        <p>Implicit in the emphasis on redundant power supplies and backup systems is a skepticism that the deregulated electrical industry will be able to supply all the power the companies will need on a reliable basis. But at the same time, the companies are pushing the utilities to install equipment to supply power well in excess of their present needs. This is particularly true in New York, where the companies fear Con Ed will not be able to handle the full load, particularly during a hot summer.</p>
        <p>Although Con Ed has sold many of its generating plants under the terms of deregulation, it is still responsible for delivering power and there are physical limits on how much power it can buy outside the region and transmit into the city.</p>
        <p>''Obtaining electrical capacity is difficult, particularly in New York City,'' Mr. Bogad said. ''So the companies overstate their requirements, so they will have it if they ever need it.'' He said the companies say new generations of equipment are physically smaller than earlier gear, so more can be crammed into the same space. This increases the need for power to operate the equipment and more power for cooling to keep temperatures low enough that the equipment will not be damaged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bogad said he had not seen an installation that required more than 30 watts per square foot. But the Dursts want 100 watts per square foot and say Con Ed has agreed to supply it.</p>
        <p>THAT poses a problem for any utility. The utility makes the capital expenditure to install the distribution equipment and recovers its investment as the user buys electricity. But if it installs gear to supply 100 watts per square foot and the user demands only 20 or 25 watts per foot, it is not receiving payment on all of its invested capital.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bogad said utilities would sometimes agree to install capacity well in excess of a user's likely need if the user is willing to make payments above the cost of purchased electricity. And, he said, many of the telecommunications companies are willing to pay. ''Time is important to these companies, and when they need the capacity, they want it there in a hurry,'' he said. ''With the revenues they are anticipating, they are willing to pay for reserve capacity.''</p>
        <p>A Con Ed spokesman said the utility is willing to provide the extra electrical capacity, as long as customers are prepared to pay for the cost of the extra equipment and maintenance.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications companies can be difficult neighbors in a crowded city. Residents of TriBeCa have complained that the noises from the equipment operating at 60 Hudson have disturbed the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Durst executives say their neighbors on the far west side of Manhattan are less likely to be disturbed, because most are business or industrial, rather then residential.Current plans call for placing all the louvers on the 58th Street side of the building, where there is a block square Con Ed plant. The sites at both ends of the block are to be developed in later phases, perhaps as office buildings, since that is the Durst specialty.</p>
        <p>The zones in the telecommunications building are designed to accommodate auxiliary equipment like generators, coolers and batteries. The mechanical equipment zone will have a load bearing capacity of 250 pounds per square foot, compared with 150 pounds a square foot for the rest of the structure and less than 100 pounds per square foot for a standard office building.</p>
        <p>In recognition that telecommunications companies often hang cables from the ceiling for ready access, the floors will also be capable of sustaining a hanging load of 100 pounds per square foot. The roof equipment zone will be reinforced to carry 250 pounds per square foot for tenants' communications, electrical and mechanical equipment.</p>
        <p>The lower level will be available for tanks to store fuel and coolant. It will also have parking for 100 vehicles, most likely to service tenants' wiring networks.</p>
        <p>Robert Fox, a senior principal of Fox &amp; Fowle, the architects of the NYCyberCenter, said designing a new building is easier than adapting an existing one to the needs of telecommunications companies. ''These companies are talking about millions of dollars a minute; they cannot afford to go down,'' he said. ''They need something better than the best.''</p>
