        <p>A new apartment in NoHo is inviting comparisons to the voyeuristic set of CBS's ''Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>The fully furnished studio is actually a three-dimensional billboard at Lafayette and Bond Streets created by the Swedish companies Ikea and Absolut. Anchored to a three-story stanchion, the apartment measures 19 by 49 feet, has a bathtub, kitchen appliances and even throw pillows and is shaped like the familiar vodka bottle.</p>
        <p>The $100,000 advertisement has been praised by Madison Avenue, but not everyone is smitten. Twice since the billboard's debut on July 6, vandals have pelted the ad with blue paint.</p>
        <p>In response, the billboard's owner installed a tiny security camera inside the bathtub to capture the vandals on video. But neighbors say the camera can also see into their apartments.</p>
        <p>''It's an invasion of my privacy,'' said Ronald Hollander, who lives at 7-9 Bond Street, a cast-iron building across the street from the billboard. The sign overlooks Mr. Hollander's bedroom, as well as the place where his two daughters sleep. ''Their property is important, but my privacy is more important,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Paul Whitby, the general counsel for Van Wagoner, a billboard company that rents out the space for $12,000 a month, said the camera did not violate any laws. ''It's not interfering with their privacy,'' he said. ''It's no different from someone standing on the street and looking into their window.''</p>
        <p>Privacy advocates seem to agree. Since the camera is privately owned, ''there's no constitutional hook,'' said Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>''You could potentially have a statutory hook if there were legislation that regulated video surveillance,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''But there is nothing.''</p>
        <p>For security reasons, Mr. Whitby declined to discuss the camera's angle of vision, how the video signal is monitored and where the tapes are stored. Absolut and Ikea declined to comment on the camera.</p>
        <p>A lawsuit is already pending against Van Wagoner because of light from the billboard that reflects into some apartments. Stuart Blay, who lives in a fourth-floor loft at 7-9 Bond Street, said the glare was as bright as ''a spaceship shining in my window.''</p>
        <p>While the suit argues that the sign's six industrial lamps create a nuisance, Mr. Blay also hopes to raise privacy concerns.  ''Everyone who walks by thinks the ad is cute,'' he said, ''but they don't have to live with it.''</p>
