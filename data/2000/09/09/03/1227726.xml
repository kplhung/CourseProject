        <p>MANY passengers flying out of Africa are familiar with the ritual: the doors close and the flight attendants ask those wearing contact lenses to shut their eyes. Some passengers pull blankets over their heads.  Then they pop the tops on two cans of a sickly sweet aerosol and walk quickly down the aisles, a white cloud billowing behind them which the air-conditioning quickly dissipates.</p>
        <p>This is mosquito control at the nexus between the poor, infected world and the rich, scared one. The spray is meant to kill any bugs that slipped in while the doors were open; a long-lasting fumigant is used in the luggage hold.</p>
        <p>There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes in this world; some even suck plants. Luckily for mankind, only a few relish human blood. No one knows how many germs and worms -- from viruses to bacteria to parasites -- are loose in the bloodstreams of other animals, but it's even luckier that only a few can survive back-to-back assaults by the mosquito digestive system and the human immune system and emerge as an illness.</p>
        <p>In the New York area, the arrival of the West Nile virus last year brought home just how unpleasant an unlucky series of coincidences can be when the right mosquito for the job is around; of the 62 cases last year, 7 were fatal. Seven cases have been reported this year.</p>
        <p>If the indestructible cockroach is the Sherman tank of the insect kingdom, the fragile mosquito is its DC-7, a pioneer in linking the world by air. Most mosquitoes don't fly five miles in their lives, but a few have joined the jet age. Just last month the World Health Organization in Geneva issued a warning about ''airport malaria.''</p>
        <p>France leads the world, with 26 cases since 1970, a few of them fatal, among people who had never visited a malarious country but who lived near airports or worked at them. They were probably bitten by stowaways disembarking from flights from West Africa. In a 1994 outbreak, epidemiologists counted six malaria cases in three weeks near Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport, and calculated that 8 to 20 anopheles mosquitoes had been on each of 300 arriving flights.</p>
        <p>''These are the dangers of globalization,'' said Dr. David L. Heymann, director for communicable diseases at the World Health Organization, although he was quick to point out that humans carry disease around the globe more effectively than mosquitoes do.</p>
        <p>To stop mosquitoes, European nations have stepped up their spraying of airplanes; United States carriers hesitate, public health experts say, even on obviously dicey routes like some Caribbean flights because of fears of litigation from passengers claiming reactions to the aerosols, which the W.H.O. considers safe.</p>
        <p>Countries in northern climes have built-in barriers. As the old medical adage goes, ''The world's best public health policy is winter.'' And until a cold snap arrives, rich nations have protection that citizens of poor tropical nations often cannot afford: air-conditioners, window screens, window glass and bug repellent.</p>
        <p>What poor nations have are trucks puffing out pesticide -- something New Yorkers are now enduring as West Nile reaches Central Park. Poor nations also still spray DDT on inside walls because it is cheap, persistent and lethal. If the United States is not careful, the use of that old resource, now banned, could return, too. Americans forget that yellow fever was once endemic in the country and that mosquito species capable of spreading malaria are found as far north as Boston in summertime.</p>
        <p>Mosquito hitchhikers predate not only the jet age but the steam age. The African species Aedes aegypti, an avid man-eater with the power to carry both yellow and dengue fever, probably reached South America in slave ships. ''The eggs lived in the water containers and the live ones fed on the populations on board,'' said Michael Nathan, an entomologist with the W.H.O. ''A lot of slaves and a lot of crews died of yellow fever on the way over.''</p>
        <p>Global commerce has sped up species transfers. Used tires sent for retreading are thought to be the vehicle for Aedes albopictus, the aggressive ''tiger mosquito'' that reached the United States from southeast Asia 20 years ago and is found as far north as Minnesota. It does not usually carry fatal diseases in the United States, but can.</p>
        <p>Malaria is the riskiest candidate, but not the only one. Besides West Nile virus and its St. Louis and Japanese relatives, yellow fever, dengue fever and elephantiasis can all be injected by mosquito saliva.</p>
        <p>Mosquitoes are easy to hate, but there is no public health value in blaming them alone, particularly for West Nile. Since it survives in birds, West Nile could have entered in imported birds. Or in a gull blown far off course or, conceivably, one who shared a tick with a bird from Africa or the Middle East while both were summering near the Arctic Circle.</p>
        <p>But ''the most likely transmission was in the blood of a tourist coming back from Israel,'' said Vincent Deubel, an arbovirus specialist at the Pasteur Institute here.  There was an outbreak in rural Israel in 1998 and the New York strain is a close genetic match.</p>
        <p>Once it arrived, though, it still had to find a local mosquito to spread it around. According to Zdenek Hubalek of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 43 mosquito species can play that role. Night-biting culex pipiens obliged first; now day-biting Aedes japonicus has made the risk a 24-hour affair.</p>
        <p>Not all diseases need mosquito vectors for the animal-to-animal jump. Milkmaids caught cowpox on the job and became immune to smallpox. The AIDS virus, many scientists believe, jumped from chimpanzee blood to human in the 1940's when a hunter in central Africa nicked himself while butchering an ape.</p>
        <p>But because they are so effective at blood transfer, the flying syringes are the nearly perfect vector -- and the risk they pose is increasing. Not all that faint humming in the global village is from Internet connections.</p>
