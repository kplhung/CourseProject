        <p>Two inches, one hop and one foot separated the Mets from a shutout victory this afternoon. That is what they thought, at least, after falling to the St. Louis Cardinals, 2-1, losing in the ninth inning for the second game in a row.</p>
        <p>Fernando Vina's two-out single off Armando Benitez drove in J. D. Drew with the winning run, some 16 hours after Jim Edmonds's home run beat the Mets on Friday night. The Cardinals mobbed Vina as they had Edmonds, though Darryl Kile was most responsible for their celebration. Kile, a right-hander, threw a five-hitter, retiring the final 18 Mets and beating Mike Hampton, his teammate when both played for Houston.</p>

        <p>Two inches, one hop and one foot separated the Mets from a shutout victory this afternoon. That is what they thought, at least, after falling to the St. Louis Cardinals, 2-1, losing in the ninth inning for the second game in a row.</p>
        <p>Fernando Vina's two-out single off Armando Benitez drove in J. D. Drew with the winning run, some 16 hours after Jim Edmonds's home run beat the Mets on Friday night. The Cardinals mobbed Vina as they had Edmonds, though Darryl Kile was most responsible for their celebration. Kile, a right-hander, threw a five-hitter, retiring the final 18 Mets and beating Mike Hampton, his teammate when both played for Houston.</p>
        <p>After Atlanta won in Houston tonight, the Braves took a half-game lead over the Mets (79-56) in the National League East.</p>
        <p>To the Mets, though, the day came down to a few excruciating inches in the sixth and ninth innings.</p>
        <p>After Hampton got a double-play grounder in the sixth, he left a sinker perhaps two inches too high in the strike zone. Craig Paquette lifted it over shortstop Mike Bordick for a single that scored Placido Polanco from third with the Cardinals' first run, which tied the game at 1-1.</p>
        <p>''The only bad pitch he threw was the one on that base hit to Paquette,'' catcher Todd Pratt said. ''And that wasn't even that bad. It was elevated enough just to let him tap it over Bordick's head. If it's two inches down, it's a ground ball to Bordick. We're talking two inches.''</p>
        <p>By the ninth inning, the score was unchanged. Hampton jammed Drew, the leadoff hitter, but Drew dropped a double into right field, sliding into second just ahead of a strong throw by the rookie Timoniel Perez.</p>
        <p>Edgar Renteria came up and popped a bunt to the third-base side of the mound. Drew was running, and Hampton said that if he had caught the bunt, ''I could have walked over and touched second myself.'' But there was no double play because the bunt bounced to a scrambling Hampton, who threw to first as Drew took third.</p>
        <p>Hampton had worked eight and a third innings by then, and Manager Bobby Valentine let him stay in to face Mike Matheny. But after Hampton threw a ball, Valentine went to Benitez, his dominant and well-rested closer.</p>
        <p>Thomas Howard batted for Matheny and walked. Ray Lankford hit for Kile and struck out, and Vina came up.</p>
        <p>Vina had been hit by Hampton's first pitch of the game. He was stranded at third that inning, one of four runners the Cardinals left in scoring position as Hampton kept his pitches down to get ground balls in big spots. But they took advantage this time.</p>
        <p>Benitez's second pitch to Vina was a backdoor slider, and Vina got the end of his bat on it, slapping it down the third-base line. Robin Ventura was playing even with the bag to guard against a bunt, and he dived to his right. Had the ball hung in the air another foot, Ventura said, he could have caught it. But it skipped past him, Drew hurried home and the Cardinals won.</p>
        <p>''The way he hit it, as soon as I didn't catch it in the air, I knew it was going to take off,'' Ventura said.</p>
        <p>Pratt saw the spin of the ball off Vina's bat and knew it would get past Ventura. Benitez drew a billiards analogy. ''He played it like a pool table,'' he said of Vina.</p>
        <p>Benitez, the major league leader in points for the Rolaids Relief Man award, lingered on the bench for several minutes after the game. Benitez has had a run of success, allowing only one earned run in his last 30 appearances, and he did not seem shaken by today's failure. ''He hit a good pitch; what can I do?'' Benitez said. ''Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.''</p>
        <p>Hampton (13-8) had a harder time with that reality. He allowed eight hits and walked only two, and the loss was his first in seven starts. ''I just hate to lose, period,'' he said, when asked if a game like today's was especially tough to take. ''I don't care what way.''</p>
        <p>Kile's dominance was familiar to Hampton, who pitched with him with the Astros' for three years. Kile got ahead of Mets hitters and then, Ventura said, he was just wild enough to get them to chase bad pitches.</p>
        <p>Ventura singled with none out in the fourth to bring in the Mets' only run, but he was the last Met to reach base off Kile (16-9), who has rediscovered the All-Star form he had in Houston. After two miserable seasons in the thin air of Colorado, Kile has settled in with the National League Central-leading Cardinals.</p>
        <p>''He's got one key ingredient that he probably lost in Colorado: he's got his confidence,'' Hampton said. ''He's throwing strikes with his fastball, and he's always had that curveball.</p>
        <p>''He pitched great today, and he's doing the things that I remember him doing that made him successful.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Monday in Cincinnati is the expected return date for three injured Mets: outfielder DEREK BELL (strained right hip and bruised left knee), reliever JOHN FRANCO (sore left pectoral muscle) and starter AL LEITER (strained backside).</p>
        <p>TIMONIEL PEREZ, who had a pinch-hit single and was caught stealing in his major league debut on Friday, batted leadoff Saturday. Manager BOBBY VALENTINE, who will return BENNY AGBAYANI to that spot on Sunday, joked that his critics would be happy with the speedy, 5-foot-9-inch Perez batting first. ''They'll think we finally found someone,'' Valentine said. Perez, who started in right field, went 0 for 4 and popped up when trying to bunt for a hit in the eighth.</p>
