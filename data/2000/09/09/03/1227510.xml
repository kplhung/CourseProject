        <p>WESTCHESTER residents can now find the lowest prices for gasoline on a Web site run by the county.</p>
        <p>The free service, which is available at www.westchestergov.com/consumer, displays the average price for all types of fuel in an area and lists local stations from cheapest to most expensive by typing in the name of a town or a ZIP code.</p>
        <p>The site has received almost 68,000 visits since it went up on June 29, Susan Tolchin, a county spokeswoman, said.</p>
        <p>''It was tremendously well received,'' she said. ''We've heard stories from people who say they've been deluged with customers.''</p>
        <p>Prices are monitored monthly by the three full-time field inspectors for the county's Consumer Protection Division. The inspectors are normally responsible for annual checks of the octane rating and pump accuracy at the 400 gas stations in the county. Since the site went online they have updated prices three times. As of last week the lowest price was $1.62 a gallon, in Elmsford and Greenburgh, while Bedford and Armonk have consistently had the highest prices.</p>
        <p>''The site will increase competition,'' said Elaine Price, who has led the Consumer Protection Division for a year and a half. ''It certainly appears that within certain communities the higher-end gas stations are being hurt,'' though she said there were no hard figures to prove it.</p>
        <p>Prices can vary significantly, even in small villages. ''There was a difference of 12 to 17 cents in little Larchmont,'' where she lives, she said.</p>
        <p>So far, no station owners have complained, John P. Gaccione, the senior inspector, said.</p>
        <p>''We know the station owners are aware of it,'' he said. ''We've gotten mostly positive comments.''</p>
        <p>But several station owners who were listed as having among the lowest prices hadn't heard of the site.</p>
        <p>Frank Scardera, who owns a gas station on Commerce Street in Hawthorne, said that none of his customers had mentioned the Web site, but he usually had the cheapest prices in his area, and his regular customers knew it. He also said that prices had been fluctuating every couple of days.</p>
        <p>An employee at Bob's Service Station on Warburton Avenue in Hastings-on-Hudson said that he didn't think the site would affect prices or customers' buying habits.</p>
        <p>''People aren't going to go out of their way to save 5 cents a gallon,'' he said.</p>
