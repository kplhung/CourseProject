        <p>What had been presented as a fait accompli five months ago faced a new setback today when the Frankfurt stock exchange's parent company decided to postpone a shareholder vote meant to ratify a planned merger with the London Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>The decision by the parent Deutsche Borse to cancel Thursday's scheduled voting on the proposed merger with London on forming a market called iX underscores the increasing complexities in consolidating European equity markets.</p>
        <p>The London exchange has indefinitely delayed its balloting on the merger in the wake of a competing and hostile bid from OM Gruppen of Sweden, which owns the exchange in Stockholm as well as smaller financial businesses.</p>
        <p>What started as a grand plan for cooperation among Europe's big stock markets has been much harder to put into practice. While most agree that they want a pan-European market that makes it easier and less costly to trade, how to achieve this has been a matter of increasing contention.</p>
        <p>''The difficulties of these mergers in Europe should never be underestimated,'' said Ruben Lee, director of the Oxford Finance Group, a consulting firm.</p>
        <p>The decision by the Deutsche Borse to postpone its vote was motivated more by strategy than pragmatism, people close to the exchange said, adding that it would be unwise to hold a vote that could be binding when the situation is changing so rapidly.</p>
        <p>Frankfurt would be unlikely to sweeten its 50-50 merger terms unless it received a clear signal from London shareholders on their view of OM's proposal, these people said. The Frankfurt market will continue exploring the option of joining forces with the Madrid and Milan stock exchanges, they added.</p>
        <p>Likewise, Nasdaq of the United States, which has said that it would take a stake in iX, now appears to be keeping its options open. Nasdaq executives met with officials from OM Gruppen last week in New York for a ''friendly discussion,'' people close to those talks said. It is understood that Nasdaq has hired Dresdner Kleinwort Benson as its financial adviser, though the investment bank declined to confirm or deny that it had been retained.</p>
        <p>What happens with the London-Frankfurt merger plans will go a long way toward deciding how stock exchanges in the rest of Europe consolidate. OM's model is based on a single trading system, one regulatory system and consolidated processes for clearing and settlement -- the financial details of paying for and receiving shares that are purchased on the exchange. The iX plan, by contrast, would use one trading system, but would split the markets between London and Frankfurt, rely on two sets of regulations and separate clearing and settlement houses.</p>
        <p>''Most of the transaction costs come from clearing and settlement,'' Mr. Lee said. ''If the key point is to reduce transaction costs, then iX is flawed.''</p>
        <p>The bidding for the London Stock Exchange is also pitting big banks against retail brokers, each industry wanting to promote its vision of how stocks will be traded in the future.</p>
        <p>Some of the larger banks have expressed support for iX as a step toward a pan-European exchange because it combines two of Europe's largest markets. In contrast, Brian Winterflood, founder of Winterflood Securities, a retail brokerage firm, is critical of iX because it calls for growth stocks, his main source of business, to be listed in Frankfurt. He said he preferred a combination of the London Stock Exchange, OM Gruppen, Nasdaq and the London futures market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winterflood is also one of a number of retail brokers calling for the ouster of the London exchange's chairman, Don Cruickshank, and its chief executive, Gavin Casey. Both are up for re-election at what is expected to be a contentious board meeting on Thursday.</p>
