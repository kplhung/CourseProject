        <p>The police are looking for a man who they say has been robbing women at knife-point on subway trains in Brooklyn and Manhattan for the last six weeks.</p>
        <p>The suspect, identified as Darnell Gripper, 33, has struck 11 times since Aug. 4 on the A, B, D, F, N and R trains, and made his most recent attack yesterday at the 42nd Street station in Manhattan, said Detective Robert Samuel, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>He strikes at different times of the day and night,  and most of his Brooklyn robberies have been in Coney Island, said Lt. John Troeller of the Brooklyn transit detectives.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Troeller said that Mr. Gripper, who is on parole for a subway robbery last year, sits down next to his intended victim and strikes up a conversation, ''at which point, once he feels comfortable, he opens his palm and displays razor blades in the palm of his hand. He then instructs the victim to remove all of their jewelry and money that they might have in their bags.'' He has also threatened women with a knife and a screwdriver, but has not injured anyone, Detective Samuel said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gripper presents himself initially as a friendly stranger in need of help, Lieutenant Troeller said.</p>
        <p>''In many of the cases, he will walk over when they are sitting by the map,'' the lieutenant said. ''He asks them if they can assist him with directions.''</p>
        <p>Even after revealing his true intentions to his victims, Mr. Gripper keeps things calm, to avoid attracting attention, Lieutenant Troeller said. He tells his victim, ''if anyone asks, say he's their boyfriend, and rides with them a number of stops while removing their property,'' the lieutenant said.</p>
        <p>Several times, Mr. Gripper has escorted his victims off the train and led them to A.T.M.'s to withdraw more cash for him, and he has been caught on security cameras, Lieutenant Troeller said. Some victims have also identified Mr. Gripper from a photo lineup, Detective Samuel said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gripper was assigned to the Bellevue Men's Shelter when he was released on parole in August but is not there, Lieutenant Troeller said.</p>
