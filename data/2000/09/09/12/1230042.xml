        <p>President Clinton attended a fund-raiser and political rally here today to support the re-election campaign of Representative James H. Maloney, hoping to tip the scales in a tight Congressional race that has drawn intense interest from both major parties nationally.</p>

        <p>President Clinton attended a fund-raiser and political rally here today to support the re-election campaign of Representative James H. Maloney, hoping to tip the scales in a tight Congressional race that has drawn intense interest from both major parties nationally.</p>
        <p>In a rematch of the 1998 campaign, Mr. Maloney, a two-term incumbent Democrat, is being challenged by Mark Nielsen, a Republican lawyer and former state legislator. Two years ago, Mr. Nielsen came within 2,400 votes of unseating Mr. Maloney in one of the country's closest races.</p>
        <p>At a luncheon that raised more than $200,000 for the Maloney campaign and at the rally later on the campus of Western Connecticut State University here, Mr. Clinton warmly embraced Mr. Maloney, presenting him as part of a Democratic package for continued prosperity.</p>
        <p>''You need Al Gore, Joe Lieberman and Jim Maloney,'' he told more than 3,000 people who filled an outdoor amphitheater for the rally. Mr. Clinton, who campaigned earlier in the day in Westchester County for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the New York Senate race, also included her in that package.</p>
        <p>''Thanks for the Hillary sign back there,'' he told someone in the Danbury crowd as he prepared to leave the stage. ''If you get to New York, help her.'' After the rally, Mr. Clinton went to New York City to attend three more events, including a fund-raiser for Representative Anthony Weiner, a Brooklyn Democrat.</p>
        <p>Both major parties believe they can win the race in Connecticut's Fifth Congressional District, and Mr. Clinton's arrival came just three days after Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential nominee, was at a campaign event at a Shelton, Conn., housing complex for the elderly.</p>
        <p>But the president's warm endorsement of Mr. Maloney today contrasted starkly with the icy treatment that Mr. Nielsen received on Friday from Mr. Cheney after the Nielsen campaign unveiled a new advertisement presenting Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Cheney's opponent, as a model of integrity in public office.</p>
        <p>The commercial, which also showed former President Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona, sought to portray Mr. Maloney as dishonest by referring to the 1997 conviction of his brother, Robert Maloney, on charges of violating federal campaign finance laws. The advertisement accused Mr. Maloney of letting ''his brother take the fall.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton posed for pictures today with his arm around Mr. Maloney and worked the crowds with him side by side, Mr. Cheney not only did not mention Mr. Nielsen in his speech on Friday but did not even acknowledge his presence, declining even to shake the fellow Republican's hand.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Clinton told more than 700 guests at today's luncheon: ''This is a good man representing you in the United States Congress. He deserves to be re-elected.'' Mr. Clinton twice reminded the crowd of the close margin in 1998, urging them to be active in the campaign.</p>
        <p>In going on the campaign trail today, Mr. Clinton touched on the major themes of the Democratic national ticket, emphasizing the economy, health care, education and the environment. He also engaged in what is becoming his familiar routine about not being on the ballot.</p>
        <p>''My family has a new candidate, my party has a new leader and I have become the cheerleader in chief,'' he told the lunch crowd. ''And I like it.'' But he seemed eager as ever to work the crowds, stopping with Mr. Maloney on the route between events to shake hands with voters outside a supermarket.</p>
        <p>For Danbury, a city of approximately 65,000 near the New York border, Mr. Clinton's visit was a major event. Over and over, local officials repeated that no sitting president had made a real visit to Danbury since Theodore Roosevelt stopped in town in 1905.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of people lined the streets for a glimpse of the president's motorcade, many waving American flags and snapping pictures. At times, the day's events seemed as much for Mr. Clinton as for Mr. Maloney.</p>
        <p>''Thank you, Mr. President, because we in Danbury are better off than we were eight years ago,'' Mayor Gene F. Eriquez said at the rally. ''Mr. President, this is your legacy, eight years of prosperity and progress here in the city of Danbury.''</p>
