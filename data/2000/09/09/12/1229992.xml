        <p>Reed E Hundt letter on Sept 9 article notes broadcast networks are required by law and tradition to carry three prime-time presidential debates at no cost; urges Gov George W Bush's campaign to abide by tradition</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign is reconsidering whether to take part in the debates on free broadcast TV that the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has arranged (news article, Sept. 9). As this matter is negotiated by the campaigns and with the commission, I hope that all are aware that the broadcasters will carry three debates in prime time, at no cost, to every home not by accident but because of the law.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign is reconsidering whether to take part in the debates on free broadcast TV that the bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has arranged (news article, Sept. 9). As this matter is negotiated by the campaigns and with the commission, I hope that all are aware that the broadcasters will carry three debates in prime time, at no cost, to every home not by accident but because of the law.</p>
        <p>Specifically, broadcasters have obtained their licenses on the condition that they serve the ''public interest,'' and the tradition has been that they show three debates and all at the same time. The Bush campaign should abide by this tradition so that the debates are seen by the widest possible audience and Americans can best learn how the major candidates stand on the issues.</p>
