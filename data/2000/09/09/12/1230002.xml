        <p>Rick Reed had last pitched at Shea Stadium in the Mets' final game in August. They won that night, and by their next game, they were alone in first place. Life was grand.</p>
        <p>The mood was decidedly different at Shea last night, when Reed pitched again. The Mets were humbled by the Milwaukee Brewers, 8-2, their eighth loss in 10 games this month. Past September failures seem to be haunting the Mets, but they never saw it coming.</p>
        <p>''It's really weird, if you think about it,'' Reed said. ''We played pretty well up until Sept. 1. As soon as the month of September hit, I mean -- boom. It's really hard to explain. We've got to figure out a way to get out of it. I think what we need to do is go out and relax and play the game.''</p>
        <p>That is what a team like the Brewers can do at this time of year. The Philadelphia Phillies, who had baseball's worst record, beat the Mets twice over the weekend. The Brewers, another also-ran, caused the Mets to crumble again. They managed only seven hits, with bases-empty home runs accounting for all their offense.</p>
        <p>The Mets dropped to three games behind the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. Their wild-card lead over Arizona was cut to four games; the Diamondbacks played at Los Angeles last night.</p>
        <p>The Brewers have baseball's worst batting average and have issued the most walks. But last night, they banged 12 hits, the final one a 425-foot home run over the left-field bleachers by Charlie Hayes, whom the Mets released this spring. And when walks got the Brewers in a bases-loaded jam in the third inning, the Mets could not take advantage.</p>
        <p>But a loss like last night's has little to do with the opponent, first baseman Todd Zeile said. Zeile has tried not to dwell on what has happened. ''Analysis can be counterproductive; that's my best analysis,'' he said. But the cause of the slump is obvious.</p>
        <p>''We're flat, and we haven't been playing good baseball,'' Zeile said. ''We've struggled offensively. I heard a stat that said we've had 15 straight games without 10 hits. That's what you call struggling for a solid two weeks.''</p>
        <p>Zeile's statistic is accurate. Since the Mets beat Randy Johnson and the Diamondbacks on Aug. 25, they have batted .200, averaging 6.3 hits.</p>
        <p>Through it all, the Mets still have a reasonably comfortable lead for a playoff spot; players routinely point this out. Manager Bobby Valentine says the first five months are a more accurate barometer of his team.</p>
        <p>''It's been all of, whatever, eight games,'' he said. ''We've played 130 pretty good ones without any stretch. I think 130 games is a lot more indicative than the eight is.''</p>
        <p>Valentine is trying everything. Last night, he surprised his No. 8 hitter, the veteran Mike Bordick, by having the rookie Timo Perez pinch-hit for him in the ninth inning. But, Bordick admitted, he has not been swinging well, and he was not the most celebrated Met to be replaced last night.</p>
        <p>Third baseman Robin Ventura, who is hitless in his last 23 at-bats,  got another night off. He has sat out three of the Mets' last five games, and Valentine gave him last night off, he said, so he could work on his swing. ''You don't hit with theory -- you hit with feeling,'' Valentine said. ''And he needs to have a good feeling.''</p>
        <p>Valentine rested Ventura last Wednesday because a ball had deflected off the top of the batting cage and struck his elbow in batting practice the day before; Ventura said he was healthy enough to play. Ventura got a routine off-day Sunday before being benched again last night.</p>
        <p>Ventura, whose .222 batting average is about 50 points below his career mark, accepted the decision, though he sounded a bit bewildered.</p>
        <p>''This is what's going to happen, so that's what I'm going to do,'' Ventura said. ''I understand it. I don't blame him at all. All I'm doing is trying to work to get better, and when he wants to play me, he's going to play me.''</p>
        <p>Ventura took an extra round of batting practice, trying to stand more upright in the batter's box. He has been leaning his front shoulder toward third in an effort to hit the outside pitch, the hitting coach Tom Robson said. His new approach, Ventura hopes, will allow him to see the ball longer and hit up the middle with more consistency.</p>
        <p>Matt Franco replaced Ventura last night, and he homered in his first at-bat. But when Milwaukee starter Paul Rigdon wavered in the third, allowing a single to Derek Bell and two walks, it was Franco -- not Ventura, one of baseball's most dangerous bases-loaded hitters -- who batted. He lined sharply to short, but Mark Loretta caught it on one hop and threw to first to end the inning.</p>
        <p>By then, the Brewers had taken a 3-2 lead off Reed (9-5), who allowed five runs in six innings. The crushing blow was a two-run double in the third by Loretta, who outlasted Reed in a nine-pitch at-bat. In another circumstance, Reed said, Loretta might have hit the ball at someone, or grounded into a double play.</p>
        <p>''But things aren't going our way right now, and that's usually what happens -- they find holes, gaps,'' Reed said. ''But I think we'll turn it around. We're still not in bad shape.''</p>
        <p>Then again, the Mets realize that their season depends on them breaking from their slump. That reality is reinforced against teams like the Phillies and Brewers.</p>
        <p>''They have nothing to lose,'' Reed said, ''and we've got everything to lose.''</p>
