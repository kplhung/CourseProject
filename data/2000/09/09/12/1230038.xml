        <p>Because Bobby Valentine is in the last year of his contract with the Mets, his future status with them has been a frequent topic of conversation this season. Whether or not the talk has served as a distraction is a matter that has often been addressed and disputed by people who are paid to watch the Mets and analyze them.</p>
        <p>One element of the issue that cannot be disputed, however, is the fact that the Mets' annual September swoon started immediately after the first indication surfaced that the Mets planned to give Valentine a new contract.</p>
        <p>Cause and effect? Who knows? Perhaps only subsequent developments will provide the answer.</p>
        <p>But here is the chronology of events that are worth pondering as concerns about the Mets' immediate future obfuscate what once seemed like a certain postseason appearance for a second successive season:</p>
        <p>*Aug. 30 -- Mets defeat Houston, 1-0, and remain tied, for the third straight day, for first place with the Atlanta Braves in the National League East. After the game, Valentine tells the Times's Jack Curry that he feels he will return as the manager. He bases his view on conversations he has had with Fred Wilpon, the team's co-owner.</p>
        <p>*Aug. 31 -- The Mets don't play, but they assume sole possession of first because the Braves lose.</p>
        <p>*Sept. 1 -- The Mets lose in St. Louis, beginning a stretch in which they will lose 8 of 10 games and plunge three games behind the Braves.</p>
        <p>Cause and effect?</p>
        <p>The Mets suffered the eighth loss in 10 September games last night, 8-2 to the less-than-mediocre Milwaukee Brewers at Shea Stadium, getting only five hits.</p>
        <p>They have now scored three runs or fewer in 12 of their last 15 games. Their two biggest offensive games in that time ended in losses. The Mets' pitching is good, but no pitching is good enough to pitch shutout after shutout to counter a weak-hitting team.</p>
        <p>Rick Reed demonstrated that last night. After permitting no more than three earned runs in eight of his previous nine starts, he gave up five in six innings.</p>
        <p>''The guys are doing everything we can to go out and get hits and score runs,'' Darryl Hamilton said, ''but I haven't been on a team where everyone just completely shut down and got into a slump, and that's where we're at right now.''</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura, the most obvious suspect in the mystery of the missing offense, was not in the starting lineup for the second straight game. He and his .222 batting average, his lowest of the post-April part of the season, occupied the bench as Valentine opted to give the third baseman additional time to work on improving his swing.</p>
        <p>No one can fault Mike Piazza's offensive contribution, but even he has slowed his production and along with it his chances of being the league's most valuable player. If it's a catching-weary Piazza the Mets are seeing, that development does not bode well for the final weeks of the season either.</p>
        <p>''I think Mike has pushed himself a little,'' Valentine said. ''We pushed him physically a lot.''</p>
        <p>Off the field, Valentine for the first time since April has prompted quizzical looks over something he said. He engaged in that kind of talk regularly last year.</p>
        <p>Since his controversial act at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania early in the season, Valentine had been a model citizen, saying nothing that would give his employers reason to question the wisdom of giving him a new contract. One of those employers supposedly warned him to avoid making such comments, but the fact he had been able to behave himself was a plus for him.</p>
        <p>But before Sunday's game, Valentine, without being asked about it, volunteered that General Manager Steve Phillips had told him he had to do something to straighten out the Mets' problems. That conversation, or Valentine's interpretation of the conversation, apparently came as news to Phillips.</p>
        <p>Periodically last season Valentine expressed strange and controversial thoughts either unsolicited or in response to questions that had nothing to do with his answers. Those incidents did not serve the manager or the team well.</p>
        <p>The September stumble hasn't either. Instead of focusing everyone's attention on the march toward the playoffs, the streak has prompted thoughts of Valentine's managerial past and his inability to take a team to the top of its division.</p>
        <p>It was the game in St. Louis, in fact, the one that started September, that sent Valentine past Paul Richards into second place behind Jimmy Dykes on the career list of games managed without finishing first.</p>
        <p>Before that day, no Valentine team had ever been in first place on any day in September. Of course, this team hasn't been in first any day since then either. Valentine's five Mets teams have a losing record in September, 53 victories, 60 defeats. The pattern was the same in seven Septembers in Texas.</p>
        <p>But his history has not deterred Bobby's Bobos, a group that has displayed undying loyalty to Valentine no matter what his transgressions, from lobbying for a new contract for the manager.</p>
        <p>Maybe what the Mets need to turn themselves on again is for management to declare -- and mean it -- that no decision has been made on Valentine's future. Maybe Wilpon had the right idea all along.</p>
