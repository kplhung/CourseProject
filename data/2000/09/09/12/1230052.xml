        <p>If Kirk McLean was not concerned, Coach Ron Low sure was. ''Very much so,'' Low said, after McLean came up with back spasms in the Rangers' camp.</p>
        <p>McLean, the starting goaltender while Mike Richter recuperates from knee surgery, played down the severity of the spasms and said he would probably be ready to practice this morning.</p>
        <p>''I just need a little rest to loosen it up,'' the 34-year-old goaltender said. But Low seemed a little upset that McLean continued to practice until the first session of the day was through in Burlington, Vt.</p>
        <p>''If it got worse on him, he should have likely gone off,'' said Low, a former National Hockey League goaltender. ''Back spasms are something you don't want to have at this point in time.''</p>
        <p>In the Rangers' case, especially because Richter is out until mid-October, at least, leaving the untested 28-year-old Jean-Francois Labbe as McLean's probable backup.</p>
