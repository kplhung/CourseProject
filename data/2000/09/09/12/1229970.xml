        <p>After a two-and-a-half-year delay and $16 million in cost overruns, electronic tolls will make a debut later this month on the New Jersey Turnpike, one of the nation's most heavily used roadways, officials announced today.</p>
        <p>Beginning Sept. 30, every toll plaza along the 148-mile superhighway will accept both cash and the mounted windshield devices that are part of the E-ZPass system, bringing the turnpike in line with the other major roads, bridges and tunnels from Boston to Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>After a two-and-a-half-year delay and $16 million in cost overruns, electronic tolls will make a debut later this month on the New Jersey Turnpike, one of the nation's most heavily used roadways, officials announced today.</p>
        <p>Beginning Sept. 30, every toll plaza along the 148-mile superhighway will accept both cash and the mounted windshield devices that are part of the E-ZPass system, bringing the turnpike in line with the other major roads, bridges and tunnels from Boston to Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>While the arrival of E-ZPass is a welcome milestone for the 600,000 motorists a day who travel the turnpike, its advent will also make history because it allows the turnpike to become the nation's first major highway to use so-called variable pricing. The system that rewards drivers who avoid rush hour by charging them lower tolls.</p>
        <p>The discounts are also intended to help take the bite out of a rate increase that goes into effect the same day the E-ZPass system does. Tolls rise 20 percent for passenger cars and 13 percent for trucks. The price for driving the whole turnpike will rise to $5.50 from $4.60.</p>
        <p>Drivers who use an E-ZPass will pay only an 8 percent toll increase if they travel during peak hours (7 to 9 a.m. and 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. weekdays). Those who travel at off-peak times will pay the current toll rate, which varies depending on where a driver enters the turnpike. A similar rate increase will take effect in 2003.</p>
        <p>Turnpike Authority officials said they hope drivers will come to accept the kind of two-tier pricing system that has become commonplace in the hotel, telephone and travel industries.</p>
        <p>''We're very excited about this new feature and we hope the public agrees that this will make everyone's life easier,'' said Edward Gross, the authority's executive director.</p>
        <p>It has been rough going for the authority and its contractor, Adesta Transportation, which have been criticized for escalating costs and missed deadlines. For New Jersey drivers, that has meant unrelieved congestion and envy, as neighboring states successfully installed similar systems on their roadways. E-ZPass participants who travel New York's Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, for example, have been breezing through toll lanes for more than three years.</p>
        <p>Turnpike officials have blamed their woes on circumstances beyond their control. Work was delayed a year while a rival bidder unsuccessfully tried to win the contract from Adesta, and another year passed while the state Legislature wrote a law that allows cameras at toll plazas to photograph the license plates of toll-evading drivers.</p>
        <p>The project's contract was not signed until 1998 -- the year Gov. Christine Todd Whitman had said that the system would be up and running.</p>
        <p>Despite the delays, transportation advocates hailed the authority's decision to use variable pricing, an innovation they hope will be adopted for toll roads across the country.</p>
        <p>''It's very encouraging that the Turnpike Authority has been bold enough to put their toe in the water of variable pricing,'' said Martin Robins, a transportation expert at Rutgers University. ''I think we can expect to learn a huge amount from this experiment.''</p>
        <p>Kristen Fountain, a spokeswoman for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a group that advocates transportation reform, said she believed variable pricing would ease the worst rush-hour gridlock.</p>
        <p>''It gives people with flexible schedules the option to pay less and those without flexibility the benefit of less traffic and a faster commute,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Municipalities around the country are considering variable pricing, as are the two agencies that operate the region's bridges and tunnels: the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
