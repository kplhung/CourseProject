        <p>While the Ford Motor Company has resisted recommending a higher pressure for Firestone tires on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles in the United States, the automaker was moving by 1999 to start using a slightly different tire with higher pressure for Explorers in Venezuela, according to a document obtained by Congressional investigators.</p>

        <p>While the Ford Motor Company has resisted recommending a higher pressure for Firestone tires on Ford Explorer sport utility vehicles in the United States, the automaker was moving by 1999 to start using a slightly different tire with higher pressure for Explorers in Venezuela, according to a document obtained by Congressional investigators.</p>
        <p>The document, a one-page table listing various tire specifications for a wide range of Ford models in export markets, also shows a big difference between the tires that Ford chooses for cars and the tires that it chooses for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>The tires on Ford and Lincoln cars and even Ford Windstar minivans can be safely driven for up to half an hour at a time at top speeds of 130 to 149 miles an hour. That allows an ample safety margin because few of these cars can actually go that fast, according to the Ford document.</p>
        <p>But the tires on most Ford light trucks -- sport utilities and pickups -- are only designed for a temporary top speed of 106 to 112 miles an hour. That provides a small safety margin because some of these models can go close to 100 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>Light trucks have been built differently and regulated differently from cars for decades, a reflection of their origins as commercial vehicles driven slowly in cities by small business owners. But with growing evidence that many Americans view sport utilities as cars and drive them like cars, regulators have begun looking at whether sport utilities should be regulated more like cars.</p>
        <p>Although the document does not provide tire speed ratings for vehicles in the United States, these tend to be fairly similar to the speed ratings for exported models, which are often produced in the same factories.</p>
        <p>The steps taken in Venezuela are significant because as Firestone proceeds with the recall of 6.5 million similar tires in the United States, Firestone and Ford have disagreed publicly over the recommended pressure for the recalled tires. Ford declined to comment on the document. Christine Karbowiak, a Firestone spokeswoman, said Firestone stopped supplying new Explorers with tires in Venezuela in September 1999, when Goodyear began supplying them.</p>
        <p>Higher pressure makes tires less likely to fail and allows them to carry more weight. But higher pressures also make the ride bumpier and can make a vehicle more likely to roll over even without a tire failure.</p>
        <p>Ever since the introduction of the Explorer in late 1990, Ford has recommended that owners inflate the tires to 26 pounds per square inch. That is a lower pressure than most automakers recommend for rival midsized sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>Firestone did not publicly question the pressure recommendation in the United States for 10 years, but did so when the recall was announced on Aug. 9, surprising Ford executives by suddenly suggesting that Explorer owners inflate their tires to a pressure of 30 pounds per square inch until they could find replacement tires. Ford officials subsequently recommended a range of pressures from 26 to 30 pounds.</p>
        <p>In Venezuela, Ford chose new tires with a recommended pressure of 30 pounds in 1999, according to the investigators' document, a one-page table dated June 6, 2000. The new tire was the same size as the tire being recalled in the United States and the new tire was certified as usable for the same top speed as in the United States, 112 miles per hour.</p>
        <p>Before the new tires were introduced, Ford had been using Firestone tires of the same size, but with a top speed of 106 miles per hour and a recommended pressure of 28 pounds. Computerized engine controls actually limit the Explorer's speed to 99 miles per hour in the United States.</p>
        <p>But Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is the chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, has emphasized tire pressure in his investigation while Ford has called it a ''red herring.''</p>
