      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that the four major options exchanges agreed for years to restrain competition by not seeking to trade options already traded on other exchanges.</p>
        <p>The exchanges -- the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the Pacific Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange -- signed a consent decree with the Justice Department and accepted a censure by the S.E.C. but did not admit any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>The existence of the investigations, coupled with the entry of another competitor, the International Securities Exchange, had already broken down the barriers that the regulators complained about, and most major options are now traded on multiple exchanges. It is not yet clear, however, whether that competition is benefiting investors or just the brokerage firms that send orders to the exchanges.</p>
        <p>Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, said that the agreement by the exchanges not to compete with one another's listings ''harmed consumers by depriving some investors of better prices, lower transaction fees and higher quality services.''</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. and the Justice Department painted a picture of an active conspiracy that went on for years after the S.E.C. ended legal bars to multiple listing of options in 1990. As part of that conspiracy, exchange officials used ''threats, intimidation and harassment'' when some exchange members tried to promote competition, the Justice Department said.</p>
        <p>But having set forth assertions of a long-lasting conspiracy that harmed many investors, the S.E.C. and the Justice Department stopped short of penalizing the exchanges by imposing fines.</p>
        <p>Instead, the exchanges, which are self-regulatory organizations responsible for monitoring the conduct of those who trade on the exchanges, agreed to spend more money on surveillance and the enforcement of trading rules. The four exchanges agreed to spend a total of $77 million on such activities over the next two years, which the S.E.C. said represented about a 50 percent increase.</p>
        <p>''The $77 million will provide what we believe to be real concrete benefits to investors,'' said Richard Walker, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director, when asked why there was no fine. ''We've structured the settlement to put the money where it counts.''</p>
        <p>While no fines are to be paid, the Chicago and American exchanges said they had reached tentative settlements of a class-action suit covering the same issues but did not elaborate.</p>
        <p>A person briefed on the agreements said they called for the Chicago exchange to pay $16 million and the American exchange to pay $14 million.</p>
        <p>In addition, market makers at the various exchanges are to pay a total of about $45 million.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia and Pacific exchanges previously settled that suit by agreeing to pay a total of $7.3 million.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C., in its censure of the exchanges, said they had not met their legal obligations to enforce compliance with rules intended to give priority to customer orders and requiring options market makers to live up to the quotes they post. The spending being required is intended in part to enhance enforcement of those rules.</p>
        <p>The options exchanges, while neither admitting nor denying the complaints, put as good a face as possible on the agreement. ''We are satisfied that the relief sought by the S.E.C. consists largely of regulatory provisions that the C.B.O.E. believes should be put in place,'' said William J. Brodsky, the chairman of the Chicago exchange.</p>
        <p>The options market is undergoing its largest upheaval in history. In the past, the four exchanges operated largely as islands, with each one having options it dominated, although there was some competition in options that began trading after 1990. There was no effective mechanism for intermarket communication so that orders could be routed from one market to another if one offered better prices.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. is trying to change that by forcing exchanges to agree to an intermarket link and has accepted one plan that exchanges may join if they wish. When that plan is operating, exchanges will either have to join it or disclose to investors when they were damaged by the exchange's absence from such a grouping.</p>
        <p>As multiple listing of options has become common, the first result was to narrow spreads -- the difference between the quoted price that market makers were offering to buy an option and the price at which they were willing to sell it. But as competition has grown, there are indications that spreads have risen, although not all the way back to the earlier level. Instead, the practice of payment for order flow -- in which brokerage firms are paid for orders that they send to one market maker or exchange -- has risen drastically.</p>
        <p>As stocks move to trading in dollars and cents, instead of in fractions, the options markets have also managed to avoid the severe competition that is to be seen in stock exchanges. In stocks, the minimum price change is to be a penny a share, meaning that an investor who wants to bid more than the current best bid for a stock need offer only a penny more than that bid.</p>
        <p>But in options, the minimum increased bid will be 5 cents for options trading at less than $3 and 10 cents for those trading for more than $3. As a result, it will be harder for options market makers to compete on the basis of price. The exchanges justify that by saying the system could not handle the surge in message traffic that would occur if smaller price changes were permitted.</p>
