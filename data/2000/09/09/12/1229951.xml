        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>LIEBERMAN RETURNS TO TEXAS  For the second time in four days, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman,  the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, traveled to Texas yesterday, and spoke at four events in Dallas and in the Austin area, raising $1.7 million for the Democratic National Committee. On Friday, Mr. Lieberman held a forum in a low-income neighborhood in Houston to attack Gov. George W. Bush's record on children's health care. Yesterday, at the Austin home of Thomas J. Meredith, who directs Dell Computer's venture capital fund, Mr. Lieberman spoke to 150 people at a $5,000-a-couple luncheon.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE SLIPS  During the campaign, Gov. George W. Bush has demonstrated a sometimes tortured relationship with the language, saying ''hostile'' when he meant ''hostage,'' ''terrier'' when he meant ''tariff'' and ''vile'' when he meant ''vital.'' An article in the latest issue of Vanity Fair magazine suggests that Mr. Bush has dyslexia and is being skewered by reporters for a tendency beyond his control. Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications for the Bush campaign, said the magazine's sympathy for Mr. Bush was misplaced. Ms. Hughes said that while one of Mr. Bush's brothers, Neil, has dyslexia, the Republican presidential nominee does not. ''In the case of this story,'' Ms. Hughes said, ''fiction is stranger than truth.''</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>FOR NOW, A TOSS-UP  Four new national polls -- those for Time, Fox News, CNN/USA Today and NBC/The Wall Street Journal -- showed little change in the presidential race since Vice President Al Gore closed the gap with Gov. George W. Bush after the Democratic National Convention. None of the polls, released over the weekend, have  Mr. Gore ahead by more than three points, about the same spread that many polls released a week earlier showed. So with about eight weeks until Election Day, the race appears to be a toss-up -- at least for the moment. One caution: A fifth poll, conducted for Newsweek, has Mr. Gore ahead by a more comfortable eight percentage points.</p>
