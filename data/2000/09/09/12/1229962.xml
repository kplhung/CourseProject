        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas confidently proposed last week that as president he would put an overhaul of Medicare on the ''fast track,'' directing a new White House task force to send legislation to Congress within nine months to transform the 35-year-old government insurance program into an efficient, largely private health care marketplace.</p>
        <p>But many health experts -- and sadder but wiser veterans of past Medicare wars -- say the last decade has shown the immense difficulties in accomplishing such changes. The philosophical differences between the two parties over how to reshape Medicare are large and enduring. Health maintenance organizations  and other managed care insurance plans, which could play a central role in Mr. Bush's proposal, are no longer viewed as an easy cure-all that can both control health care costs and deliver better care.</p>
        <p>And the record of H.M.O.'s in the Medicare program has been particularly rocky, with hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries dropped in recent years by health plans complaining that the government does not pay them enough.</p>
        <p>''The experience of H.M.O.'s and seniors, and H.M.O.'s and very sick people would leave most analysts cautious about the capacity of the private sector to care for people who are very sick or very old -- people on whom you might lose money, to put it in the plainest language I can,'' said Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.</p>
        <p>Dr. Altman and others praise Mr. Bush for addressing the Medicare issue, including the need to provide some relief for the cost of prescription drugs. And many experts agree that Medicare, a program that was  designed in the 1960's, needs to be reconstructed to reflect the realities of modern medicine -- not to mention the coming wave of retiring baby boomers, who will double the number of Medicare beneficiaries in the next 30 years.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore supports a ''modernization'' plan advanced by the Clinton administration last year, aides say, although he has focused in his campaign on shoring up the traditional program and adding a prescription drug benefit to it.</p>
        <p>But as is so often the case in health policy debates, the details of creating a Medicare ''modernized for our times,'' as Mr. Bush puts it, are a matter of intense dispute.</p>
        <p>''There's no consensus view about which direction we should be heading,'' said John Rother, legislative director for AARP, an advocacy group for older people.</p>
        <p>At its root, the debate over the Bush proposal revolves around how much Medicare should be turned into a competitive marketplace, in which beneficiaries are given a fixed amount each year and are expected to choose among a variety of health plans, much as federal employees do. Mr. Bush is careful to say that the elderly can stay with the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program if they like, but critics assert that the traditional program will be inexorably weakened, in part because it is likely to retain the frailest and sickest population.</p>
        <p>Clearly, partisan mistrust is high. Many Democrats are convinced that Republicans simply cannot abide a huge, government-run social insurance program and have always wanted to privatize it. Many Republicans contend that Democrats are less interested in policy improvements than in scaring elderly voters every election year with dire warnings about what the Republicans will do to Medicare.</p>
        <p>Memories are still vivid from the battles of 1995-96, when the Republicans sought to extract $270 billion in savings from the Medicare program, and the Democrats used that proposal in a wave of campaign advertising to devastating effect.</p>
        <p>''The politics are lethal,'' said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, who led a bipartisan Medicare commission that ended in a deadlock in early 1999. ''Been there, done that,'' he said of Mr. Bush's statement last week that he would convene another Medicare task force to draft new legislation.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Bush's proposal, the bipartisan task force would build on the work done by the earlier commission, considering Mr. Bush's own plan as well as possible improvements. Its recommendation to Congress would get an expedited final vote by the end of 2001 under ''fast track'' provisions Mr. Bush would ask Congress to agree to in advance, if all went according to plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's allies assert that the political hurdles can be overcome with the right leadership in the White House. And they say that the real-world problems with Medicare H.M.O.'s can be resolved with a less bureaucratic approach than the one now exercised by the Health Care Financing Administration, the federal agency that oversees Medicare and the H.M.O.'s that participate.</p>
        <p>The current experience with Medicare H.M.O.'s ''is not a good indicator of potential problems,'' said Gail Wilensky, a top Bush health adviser who ran the health care administration under President George Bush. She said the rules had changed too often, the regulations were too burdensome and the payment increases to H.M.O.'s were often too low.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is proposing a very different system for private health plans in Medicare than the one that exists, Dr. Wilensky said. ''While I don't want to pretend that this is going to be easy,'' she said, ''there was a period when many analysts, and members of Congress, thought the basic idea'' of this proposal ''was something they could support.''</p>
        <p>Under the current Medicare system, the government sets prices and reimburses doctors and hospitals directly for the 33 million Americans in the traditional Medicare program; for the 6.2 million elderly Americans who choose H.M.O.'s, the government pays their health plan under a formula established by law.</p>
        <p>Under the Bush proposal, which Dr. Wilensky said was broadly patterned after the work of the Breaux commission, the traditional fee-for-service program would be preserved, but it would be required to compete with other plans.</p>
        <p>Each year, beneficiaries would decide how to use their government-allotted premium. Private plans would, ideally, compete vigorously for the business; beneficiaries could add their own money to the government premium and buy more generous benefit packages. This ability to choose from an array of plans is a major selling point for the program.  But critics assert that under such systems, the government-allotted premium -- particularly if it is tied to a national average of bids from the major health plans -- will never keep up with the cost of the traditional Medicare program.</p>
        <p>''What that would mean is that a lot of beneficiaries would have to go to managed care because they couldn't afford the premiums of traditional fee-for-service Medicare,'' Sarah Bianchi, a Gore adviser, said. Dr. Wilensky rejected that assertion.</p>
        <p>This exchange, though, illustrates the political difficulties of the Bush approach. While some versions of this competitive model have support across party lines, some Democrats contend that it marks a fundamental shift away from the guaranteed benefits, a 35-year-old entitlement, of the Medicare program. Republicans counter that it will provide Medicare beneficiaries with new options and benefits -- like a variety of prescription drug plans -- that the government cannot match, while still guaranteeing every beneficiary a core benefit package.</p>
        <p>The experience of the Breaux commission, which is regularly praised by Mr. Bush, is instructive. As a similar proposal took shape on the commission, the 17-member panel broke down on party lines; it needed 11 votes to make a formal recommendation. While Mr. Bush often hails the commission's proposal as bipartisan, only two Democrats on the panel -- Mr. Breaux and Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska -- supported it; eight Republicans did.</p>
        <p>''The world ought to remember that the bipartisan commission didn't support it, and the bipartisan support was two Democrats and eight Republicans,'' said Stuart Altman, a member of the commission who was appointed by the administration.</p>
        <p>Drew Altman of the Kaiser foundation said, ''The reason it went nowhere is it uncovered all the nerves that divide Democrats and Republicans.''</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration's restructuring proposal also seeks to encourage more competition among private health plans, but keeps traditional Medicare out of the competition. In general, Democrats assert that they have been good stewards of Medicare, noting that its hospital trust fund is projected to be solvent until 2025. And Mr. Gore is campaigning hard on his vow to put Medicare in a ''lock box'' so that its $400 billion in surpluses cannot be used for tax cuts or other new spending.</p>
        <p>In line with Mr. Gore's positioning as the defender of traditional Medicare, some health advocates expect him to pick apart Mr. Bush's plan for Medicare as he picked apart former Senator Bill Bradley's health care plan in the primaries.</p>
        <p>The Medicare debate is infused with the memory of other health care struggles, including the public reaction in recent years against H.M.O.'s and the insurance industry in general, which was immediately preceded by the public's reaction against government stoked by the Clinton attempt at universal coverage.</p>
        <p>Dr. Judith Feder, the dean of policy studies at Georgetown University, formerly a top Clinton health adviser, said she found it ironic that Mr. Bush would propose a task force, ''given the experience of '93-94.'' She added, ''Surely that indicates that complex issues are not likely to be dealt with in a swift way.''</p>
        <p>And even if a candidate can survive the election with his health care proposals intact, Mr. Rother of AARP noted, ''People are making so much money off the health care system that any effort to change it runs into very well-financed opposition.''</p>
