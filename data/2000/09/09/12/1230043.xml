        <p>ABOVE the west tunnel in Giants Stadium, several dozen fans, many in Jets jerseys, were perched like vultures, waiting for Bill Belichick to appear.

        <p>ABOVE the west tunnel in Giants Stadium, several dozen fans, many in Jets jerseys, were perched like vultures, waiting for Bill Belichick to appear. And when the Patriots' coach did appear, the boos descended. Heavy, hearty boos. Cruel boos. Among the serenade of those boos a heavy, hearty voice could be heard above the others.</p>
        <p>''Gutless pig,'' that heavy, hearty voice boomed.</p>
        <p>Such was the climate last night when the Jets deflated the Patriots, 20-19, in a dazzling renewal of their rivalry as Belichick, who joined the Patriots as head coach instead of fulfilling his Jets contract as Bill Parcells's successor, returned to Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>When Belichick and Al Groh, who did succeed Parcells, were on Parcells's staff, they would put together the defensive game plan and then bring it to Parcells, who would often say with his familiar sarcastic grin, ''What have you wizards come up with this week?''</p>
        <p>And for more than 50 minutes last night, Belichick appeared to be the wizard. His defenses were stifling the Jets' offense. But suddenly Vinny Testaverde, after throwing five passes to Richie Anderson, found Wayne Chrebet for a 2-yard touchdown that cut the Jets' deficit to 19-14.</p>
        <p>The next time the Jets had the ball, Testaverde completed two quick passes for 72 yards -- 44 to Dedric Ward, then 28 to Chrebet for the winning touchdown. On the Patriots' sideline, Belichick's shoulders slumped. On the Jets' sideline, Groh was the resident wizard.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't anything specific that woke up the offense, maybe just a sense of urgency,'' Groh said later. ''It was do or die.''</p>
        <p>During the warm-up, Groh walked over to Belichick, shook hands and chatted for maybe two minutes as they stood on the red-white-and-blue National Football League shield at midfield. And after the game, he had a quick conversation with Belichick on the field.</p>
        <p>''We just exchanged pleasantries before the game; we'd been through a lot of battles together in this stadium,'' Groh said. ''After the game, I just wished him well. I knew he just wanted to get out of there.''</p>
        <p>Groh and Belichick were on the same coaching staff for seven seasons with the Giants, Browns, Patriots and Jets; they remain friends. But Parcells was not at the game, having explained that his presence would have been ''too much of a circus.''</p>
        <p>For the Jets, a real rivalry has been rare, if only because in most of their 40 previous seasons the Jets (and their American Football League ancestors, the Titans) were seldom good enough to create a real rivalry.</p>
        <p>In the years leading up to and following their Super Bowl III victory, the Jets briefly had a coast-to-coast rivalry with the Oakland Raiders that flared in 1967 when Joe Namath had his cheekbone shattered (and his helmet knocked off) by defensive end Ike Lassiter.</p>
        <p>But as soon as Parcells joined the Jets after having taken the 1996 Patriots to the Super Bowl, the Jets-Patriots rivalry burst into flames. It singed not only the souls of the fans along the I-95 corridor but also the N.F.L.  schedule-makers.</p>
        <p>For the fourth straight season, the Jets and Patriots were playing in prime time, the third straight season on Monday night. But the three other games had all been at Foxboro Stadium.</p>
        <p>When Parcells returned to Foxboro on a Sunday night in the 1997 season, he was hooted by fans waving banners and wearing T-shirts that implored ''Grill the Tuna.'' When he strode onto the field for the warm-up, he was greeted with shouts of ''Show me the money!'' meaning his reported six-year, $14.4 million Jets contract.</p>
        <p>That night the Jets would've won had John Hall made a 29-yard field goal in the final seconds, but the Patriots blocked the low kick, then won in overtime, 27-24.</p>
        <p>In that season's rematch, Parcells, ''looking for a spark,'' benched Neil O'Donnell at halftime, inserted Glenn Foley at quarterback and the Jets rallied to win, 24-19.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Jets swept both games. In the 1999 season opener. Testaverde would crumple to the artificial turf in Giants Stadium with a torn left Achilles' tendon and the Patriots held on to win, 30-28. But the Jets won the Monday night rematch, 24-17, behind Ray Lucas's two touchdown passes.</p>
        <p>And last night the vultures had the last laugh on Bill Belichick.</p>
