        <p>In the first official review of the federal death penalty since it was reinstated in 1988, the Justice Department has found troubling disparities by race and geography, according to officials who have seen the report.</p>
        <p>In 75 percent of the cases in which a federal prosecutor sought the death penalty in the last five years, the defendant has been a member of a minority, and in more than half of the cases, an African-American, according to the report, which officials said the Justice Department would release on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has found that a handful of the 93 United States attorneys account for nearly half of the cases that had been sent to the department for review, officials who have seen the report said. On the other hand, about 20 United States attorneys did not file a single death penalty case since 1995.</p>
        <p>While a death penalty for at least some federal crimes has been on the books since 1988, it has yet to be carried out. The last federal execution was 37 years ago.</p>
