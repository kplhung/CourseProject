        <p>Different Politics, But Same Praise</p>
        <p>JIMMY CARTER, the former president, and Mayor RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI are members of opposing political parties, but they fell over each other with praise yesterday during a news conference to announce the completion of Habitat for Humanity's 100,000th home, on West 134th Street in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter, who has been building houses for Habitat with his wife, ROSALYNN, since 1984, said: ''If there is a better mayor in the United States of America than the one that New York City has, I don't know who it is. Mayor Giuliani has set a standard for administration of a great city that others all over the world are now seeking to emulate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani responded: ''President Carter, I think, has been exceptional in what he's done in the years after his presidency. He's helped hundreds of thousands of people; he's set an example for how you can lose the presidency and you can make as big a contribution with the rest of your life.'' Mr. Carter, he added, is ''a great example for anybody in public service as to what the real purpose and value of it is.''</p>
        <p>Not So F-Fast, F-Funny Guy</p>
        <p>Judging by the ratings, DENNIS MILLER's new gig in the booth at ABC's Monday Night Football hasn't won too many hearts. But football fans backed Mr. Miller when he was confronted by Stuttering John, HOWARD STERN's radio sidekick, at an appearance at ESPN Zone restaurant yesterday with fellow commentators and reporters AL MICHAELS, DAN FOUTS, ERIC DICKERSON and MELISSA STARK.</p>
        <p>Stuttering John asked Mr. Miller if Mr. Michaels used Rogaine (''Extra strength,'' Mr. Michaels interjected). Then, reading his questions off a piece of paper, he took issue with Mr. Miller's tendency to be highfalutin.</p>
        <p>''If you tell a joke with references no one understands, is it a joke?'' he wanted to know.</p>
        <p>''I kind of built my career not worrying if everyone gets it,'' Mr. Miller said. Then, with the crowd cheering encouragement, Mr. Miller wondered why Stuttering John had to consult his notes in order to remember four-word questions.</p>
        <p>Finally, the stuttering radio personality begged off. He had to go interview the Yankees' DEREK JETER, he said. But one of his questions hung in the air. When asked why the rest of the broadcast crew didn't laugh at Mr. Miller's jokes, Mr. Fouts answered, ''Because I don't get it, O.K.?'' Referring to Stuttering John, he said, ''I'm with that guy. You know, if a tree falls in a forest. . . .''</p>
        <p>'Cats' of the Past Join a Farewell</p>
        <p>The musical ''Cats'' had competition from the audience Sunday evening, when after 18 years on Broadway the much-maligned, hugely successful production gave its final performance. Raucous cheering, applause and several impromptu standing ovations made for several interruptions in the special 6 p.m. performance at the Winter Garden.</p>
        <p>Many of the show's former cast members showed up to scream and shout and help send the final Broadway cast off with a bang.</p>
        <p>The applause was huge for characters like Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer and even more so for the show's climactic dance number, Jellicle Ball. Just as the number was about to go into high gear, a former cast member shouted out from the audience, ''Go for it!''</p>
        <p>Among the members of the original cast who attended were BETTY BUCKLEY of ''Memory'' fame, KEN PAGE, who played the patrician Old Deuteronomy, and TERRENCE MANN, the scrappy Rum Tum Tugger.</p>
        <p>The composer ANDREW LLOYD WEBER showed up to say goodbye, as did TREVOR NUNN, the director; GILLIAN LYNNE, the associate director and choreographer; CAMERON MACKINTOSH, the producer; and GERALD SCHOENFELD and PHILIP SMITH of the Shubert Organization.</p>
