        <p>The Sugar Association is trying to convince Americans that consuming large quantities of sugar-sweetened soft drinks and snacks does not harm one's nutritional status, body weight or long-term health. But the research the association cites to support its contentions shows how statistics can often be misleading if they present only part of the story.</p>
        <p>Here is what you should know about the appalling increase in sugar consumption by Americans -- especially children -- and the effects this increase is having on health.</p>
        <p>Just How Sweet It Is</p>
        <p>Per capita consumption of sugars rose a whopping 28 percent in just 15 years, to 53 teaspoons a day by 1997. Manufacturers are quick to point out that not all that sugar is actually eaten (some is wasted), but the relative increase is real. And it does not take a rocket scientist to recognize the sources of that rise. Just walk through any supermarket or survey the menu in a fast-food establishment and you'll find sugar -- large quantities of added sugar -- at every turn, from super-sized soft drinks to breakfast cereals. Tempting sweets dominate the ends of aisles and surround the checkout counters of nearly every American market.</p>
        <p>The rush to low-fat worsened the problem; when food producers cut the fat they often added sugars to improve the flavor. If you compare the nutrition label on a fat-free cake with its full-fat version, you're likely to find only a small caloric difference, with sweeteners making up for many of the lost fat calories. The surge in artificial sweeteners seems only to have fostered the American sweet tooth. Even with the widespread availability of diet soft drinks, 80 percent of the carbonated sodas Americans consume are sweetened with real, caloric sugar.</p>
        <p>Sugars Up, Nutrients Down</p>
        <p>Last spring, the Sugar Association ballyhooed the results of two studies it financed. One, by researchers at Georgetown Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, showed that overweight children consume only about two ounces more of soft drinks a day than normal weight children. The second study, by Dr. Won Song, a food science professor at Michigan State University, found little change in children's consumption of milk and carbonated soft drinks in the decade from 1987-88 to 1997-98. Dr. Song said the data did not support claims that, at least in the decade she studied, soft drinks were replacing milk in the diets of children.</p>
        <p>However, milk was not very popular in the beginning of the decade nor at the end.</p>
        <p>A fuller review of Dr. Song's data shows that by the end of the decade, milk barely led the pack, accounting for 32 percent of beverages consumed as against 29 percent for carbonated soft drinks and 21 percent for fruit juices and drinks. And that edge disappears when sugary carbonated and noncarbonated drinks are combined.</p>
        <p>Even more disturbing is when one looks at milk consumption by age groups. Milk is least popular at ages when it is most needed for healthy bones.</p>
        <p>With each five-year period from ages 1 through 19, milk consumption dropped considerably and carbonated soft drinks soared. By ages 15 through 19, a critical time in bone formation, the amount of carbonated soft drinks was nearly double that of milk, the best source of bone-building calcium and vitamin D in the American diet.</p>
        <p>Several other studies have shown that teenagers, especially girls, do not consume enough calcium to maximize bone development, which is completed in the 20's. Thus, they could enter the long period of gradual bone loss, which begins in the early 30's, with a flimsy skeleton that can ill afford to lose anything.</p>
        <p>Further compromising bone development is the fact that colas, which contain phosphorus, are by far the leading soft drinks consumed by children and adults. Phosphorus can impede the body's ability to make use of dietary calcium when calcium intake is low. A series of studies by Dr. Grace Wyshak at the Harvard School of Public Health has found about a fivefold higher rate of bone fractures among physically active teenagers who consume the most colas.</p>
        <p>And calcium is by no means the only nutrient compromised by heavy consumption of added sugars. A most telling report last year by Shanty A. Bowman of the federal Agricultural Research Service said that since the late 1980's, as consumption of sugary foods and drinks has risen, caloric intake has increased steadily. Dr. Bowman analyzed the diets of nearly 15,000 Americans, dividing them into three groups based on the amounts of added sugars they regularly consumed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bowman showed that the more calories from added sugars people consumed, the greater the number of total calories they took in but the poorer their intake of essential nutrients, including vitamins A, E, C, all the B vitamins, magnesium, iron, zinc and calcium. Not surprisingly, high consumers of added sugars also had the lowest intake of the five food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, protein foods and dairy products), which are critical to normal growth and health maintenance.</p>
        <p>The caloric difference between the lowest and highest consumers of added sugars -- 190 calories a day -- can add up to a weight difference of about 20 pounds in a year's time. The Sugar Association would have a hard time convincing me that, soft drinks aside, calorie-rich sweets are not contributing to the inexorable expansion of the American waistline. Children and adults in this country are now fatter than ever. And as the weight of Americans has risen, so has the incidence of diabetes.</p>
        <p>The highest consumers of added sugars in Dr. Bowman's study consumed more than 10 times as many sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drinks and fruit drinks and punches as did the lowest consumers. The highest consumers of added sugars consumed the least milk, even though they also consumed the least amount of fruit juices containing natural sugars. Children, Dr. Bowman found, were more likely than adults to have a diet high in added sugars. About one-third of children ages 2 to 5 and one-half of children ages 6 to 11 were in the highest sugar-consuming group.</p>
        <p>Dietary Improvements Needed</p>
        <p>No one is suggesting a total avoidance of added sugars. It is the amount and frequency of their consumption that need curbing. But because most added sugars enter foods in the course of processing, not at the table or home kitchen, cutting back requires some knowledge of where they lurk.</p>
        <p>The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer organization in Washington, last year petitioned the Food and Drug Administration to make it possible for consumers to know how much added sugars they are consuming in processed foods. On food labels, all sugars -- both those naturally present in foods and those added in processing -- are lumped together. So it would not be possible, when eating canned peaches packed in syrup for instance, to know how much of the sugar came from the peaches and how much was added by the canner. Furthermore, in listing ingredients, food processors can disguise the importance of added sugars by using several different sweeteners in a single product, each listed separately, making it appear that sugar was not a major ingredient.</p>
        <p>In its petition, the center asked the Food and Drug Administration to establish a ''daily value'' for added sugars, an amount that would be considered reasonable for a healthy person, and to indicate on food labels how much added sugar a serving of the food contains and what percentage of the daily value that represents.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, you can make some adjustments in your own diet by becoming more aware of the added sweets you consume. Keep a diary for a week, recording the kinds and amounts of all the foods and beverages you consume that contain added sugars. Then make an effort to reduce that amount, substituting fresh fruits for some of the sugary desserts and snacks and low-fat or skim milk, fruit juices, seltzer or water for the sugar-sweetened beverages. If you make the adjustments gradually, they will feel less painful and be more likely to stick as you discover that life can be sweet without a lot of added sugar.</p>
