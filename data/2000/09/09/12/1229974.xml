        <p>QUEENS: OPEN WINDOW ABORTS TAKEOFF -- A T.W.A. jet with 233 passengers and 7 crew members on board blew out 6 of its 10 tires, aborting a takeoff at Kennedy International Airport yesterday after the pilot noticed a cockpit window open, officials said. The jet, a Boeing 767-300 on a flight to St. Louis, had reached 174 miles per hour when the pilot felt a draft, said James Peters, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration, which is investigating. Officials said that three tires blew out and three deflated from hard braking, but that two tires under the nose and one under each wing remained inflated, keeping the jet under control. No injuries were reported.</p>

        <p>THE BRONX: SCHOOLGIRLS REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULTS -- The police are searching for a man who sexually assaulted three girls on their way to St. Thomas Aquinas High School yesterday morning. The first attack occurred at 7:25 on Grote Street when the man stuck his head under the skirt of a 14-year-old, the police said. Fifteen minutes later, the same man exposed himself to a 16-year-old girl near 182nd Street, the authorities said, adding that 10 minutes later, on Quarry Road, he grabbed and kissed the buttocks of a third student. The police described the assailant as a black or dark-skinned with black curly hair, 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing 180 pounds. The man, who is in his 20's, was seen driving a new blue minivan, the police said.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: MAN STABBED AT CLUB -- A 28-year-old man was in stable condition last night after being stabbed in the stomach at the Tunnel nightclub early Sunday morning, the police said. Police said the man, whose name was not released, drove himself the 26 blocks to St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center from the club, which is at 220 12th Avenue, near West 27th Street. The man was stabbed in a dispute at about 2:15 a.m., the police said.</p>

        <p>UTICA: CHARGES IN 1978 DROWNING -- For more than two decades, 12-year-old Raymond Umber Jr.'s drowning was viewed as a tragic accident. Now, the authorities will try to prove that Raymond was killed in 1978 by a bully who walked away after pushing the boy off a pier into Oneida Lake. Yesterday, lawyers began picking the jury for the trial of Arthur L. Mills, who is charged with second-degree murder in Raymond's death. Mr. Mills's brother has come forward as a witness. An indictment accuses Mr. Mills, then 17, of pushing Raymond, causing him to strike his head and sink underwater, and then abandoning him. A lawyer for Mr. Mills, Joseph Lupia, said the boy may have died after suffering an epileptic seizure.</p>

        <p>BUFFALO: BACK TO SCHOOL, FOR NOW -- Classes resumed for 47,000 Buffalo students yesterday after striking teachers agreed to work while contract negotiations continued. Whether and how long teachers will go on working without a settlement remained in question, however. A State Supreme Court judge ordered the union not to strike. A walkout by Buffalo's 3,700 teachers, who have been working under an expired contract since June 1999, canceled two days of school last week.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN: REPORTER'S NOTES RULED PRIVATE -- A state judge ruled yesterday that a reporter did not have to turn over notes from her interviews with a prosecutor and a man who said a rabbi hired him to kill his wife. Lawyers for Rabbi Fred J. Neulander of Cherry Hill, who is charged with capital murder in the 1994 bludgeoning death of his wife, Carol, had sought the notes from Nancy Phillips, a reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer. Judge Linda G. Rosenzweig wrote in her ruling that Ms. Phillips arranged a meeting in April in which Leonard Jenoff told Prosecutor Lee Solomon of Camden County that the rabbi had hired him. But Judge Rosenzweig rejected the rabbi's assertion that Ms. Phillips had acted as an agent of the prosecutor and therefore waived the confidentiality privileges usually afforded to reporters under state law.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: DISABLED CAN KEEP MEDICAID -- Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed a bill yesterday allowing low-  and moderate-income people with disabilities to enter the workplace without losing Medicaid benefits. The law puts into effect a federal program known as Ticket to Work, under which states can grant continued Medicaid benefits to disabled people who earn up to 250 percent of the federal poverty level. Previously, people with disabilities lost their eligibility to receive Medicaid, which is paid for by states and the federal government, if their income exceeded the poverty level, a provision that critics said discouraged disabled people from going or returning to work.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: COURT APPROVES MEGAN'S RULES -- The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has approved guidelines crafted by Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. to limit the spread of information in sex offender notifications under provisions known informally as Megan's Law. A lawsuit by the state public defender's office asserted that court-ordered confidentiality rules were being ignored. But the appeals court found that guidelines sufficiently forbade neighbors, school officials and other members of the community from improperly spreading an offender's name, age and address. The court also ruled that the state's 21 counties did not need to adopt uniform penalties for notification on recipients found guilty of contempt of court for illegally spreading the information.</p>

        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: TAX OFFICIAL RESIGNS -- Richard Nicholson, the state's second-highest ranking tax official, has resigned. Mr. Nicholson, general counsel and assistant commissioner of the State Department of Revenue Services since 1992, said he wanted to pursue new professional opportunities. His resignation was effective Thursday. Mr. Nicholson, 51, of South Windsor, joined the department in 1979 as a tax lawyer.</p>
