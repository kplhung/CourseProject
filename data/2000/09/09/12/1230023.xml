        <p>Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto, Calif., said yesterday that it would begin a review for its account, with billings estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>The Sun account has been handled by the San Francisco office of Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide since April 1997.

        <p>Sun Microsystems in Palo Alto, Calif., said yesterday that it would begin a review for its account, with billings estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>The Sun account has been handled by the San Francisco office of Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide since April 1997. Sun and Lowe are parting ways because of what they described as a conflict that arose after the merger that created Lowe Lintas last year. The merger brought under one roof the accounts of Sun and a competitor, the Dell Computer Corporation.</p>
        <p>Karen Becker, worldwide advertising director at Sun, said the review was being limited to the San Francisco office of a Lowe Lintas sibling, the Martin Agency, and a team of Tonic 360 in San Francisco, the Sun interactive shop and J. Walter Thompson in New York, part of the WPP Group. Martin and Lowe Lintas are part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
