        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio tonight proposed spending $97.75 billion on education over 10 years if elected senator, with a substantial amount devoted to disabled students and programs to make teachers more accountable.</p>
        <p>In a 30-minute speech at Elmira College, Mr. Lazio, the Republican nominee for Senate from New York, laid out a far more ambitious plan than that of Gov. George W.

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio tonight proposed spending $97.75 billion on education over 10 years if elected senator, with a substantial amount devoted to disabled students and programs to make teachers more accountable.</p>
        <p>In a 30-minute speech at Elmira College, Mr. Lazio, the Republican nominee for Senate from New York, laid out a far more ambitious plan than that of Gov. George W. Bush, who wants to spend $13.5 billion over five years. Mr. Lazio's plan would come close in cost to the one proposed by his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose education proposals call for $123 billion in new spending in the next decade, her aides said tonight.</p>
        <p>Aside from cost, Mr. Lazio drew sharp distinctions between his plan and Mrs. Clinton's, firmly declaring his support for federally financed vouchers -- although he avoided using that word, instead calling for ''opportunity scholarships,'' which would provide money to parents in struggling school districts for their children's enrollment in private schools.</p>
        <p>The largest chunk of his plan -- $60 billion -- would go toward financing federally mandated programs for the disabled, the only part of his plan that drew applause from the 100 or so parents, politicians and mostly college students attending the speech. And Mr. Lazio said he would encourage the federal government to make some financing to states contingent on the testing of teachers for competency every five years.</p>
        <p>''If accountability means asking more of students, it also means asking more of teachers as well, by challenging our teachers to keep learning and improving and putting their own skills to the test,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>His speech came as he sought some momentum before his first debate with Mrs. Clinton on Wednesday. Some Republican Party officials reportedly have complained that he has not maintained a rigorous enough campaign schedule lately and has not been clear enough about what he would do if elected. And it follows within a few days Mrs. Clinton's tour of public schools late last week, and new Clinton television advertisements stressing her commitment to education and criticizing Mr. Lazio's legislative record of voting for cuts in education funds. This is Mr. Lazio's second major policy address; a tax-cutting proposal on Aug. 24 in Buffalo prompted criticism over the validity of his numbers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and his aides left promptly after the speech. He answered only two questions as he hustled out, declaring education the top concern in the election and saying his tax-cutting plan would help finance the education plan. An assistant said later that Mr. Lazio would propose using some budget surplus to finance both, leaving ''several hundred million'' dollars of the $4.4 trillion surplus projected over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Cathie Levine, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, said that some of Mr. Lazio's proposals were at odds with his Congressional votes. She said that last year he voted against a bill to provide money for school construction, but that the new plan proposes spending $5 billion to shore up decrepit buildings and build new schools. She said that a number of Mr. Lazio's proposals were ideas pushed by Democrats, like financing for special education. Mr. Lazio said his proposed spending was an answer to constant complaints from states that they were mandated by the federal government to run special education programs but were shortchanged in financing them. (Mrs. Clinton has proposed $20 billion to enhance such programs.)</p>
        <p>''A lot of this stuff are Democratic proposals,'' Ms. Levine said. ''It seems so different from where he has come down with his Congressional votes.''</p>
        <p>Many of Mr. Lazio's proposals, like allowing local districts more flexibility in spending federal money, derive from proposals Congress has approved. Mr. Lazio last year voted for a plan, rejected in the House, that would have provided annual vouchers of $3,500 to each of 27,000 students in failing schools at a total cost of $500 million over five years. His plan tonight proposed spending $5 billion, but did not say how much each parent would get.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, like the teachers' unions that support her, opposes vouchers as a drain on public resources for schools, but Mr. Lazio, while never using the politically charged word in his speech, came down for them, more emphatically than he has on the stump.</p>
        <p>''Parents should be free to pursue other options, including placing their child in the school of their choice, whether it's a public school or a private school or even a religious school,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton also diverge significantly on teacher hiring. Mrs. Clinton has proposed spending $10 billion over 10 years to recruit 75,000 people into teaching.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio gave no target figure for the number of teachers to hire, but he proposed spending $5.75 billion on a loan-forgiveness program that would pay the full tuition costs of the top 10 percent of students in undergraduate colleges who decide to go into teaching for at least three years.</p>
        <p>Strategists rank education among the top concern of voters, who generally credit the Democrats with a stronger interest than Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio chose to deliver the address in Elmira, his aides said, in part to boost his presence upstate, where he leads Mrs. Clinton in most polls but by a 10-point margin, which strategists do not believe is enough to secure a victory.</p>
        <p>''He needs to strengthen his numbers upstate, and by coming upstate and discussing a very important issue like education it's going to give him a spotlight,'' said Stephen F. Coleman, an associate professor of political science at Elmira College.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Lazio chose to make his speech at an odd hour for a major policy address, beginning his remarks about 7:30 p.m., past the time for the early evening news programs and encroaching on the deadline for many daily newspapers. It was also unusual for Mr. Lazio not to take questions from reporters or seek to explain his proposals further.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides asserted that Mr. Lazio wanted to escape scrutiny for his plan, but Mr. Lazio's spokesman, Dan McLagan, said the time was a matter of convenience for the congressman and for the people invited to hear the address. College officials said the Lazio camp asked them only on Friday if he could make the speech there.</p>
        <p>While an array of politicians stumped in schools in the past week as students returned to classes, Mr. Lazio, who has maintained a busy schedule of fund-raisers and photo opportunities at festivals and shopping centers, did not. He has not made a public visit to a school in two months, though he said he planned to visit a high school civics and history class in Syosset on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, as he climbed aboard his bus, Mr. Lazio answered a reporter who had asked if education was now his top concern.</p>
        <p>''I believe it is the top issue in the campaign, yes,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>HIGHLIGHTS  Blueprint for Education Spending</p>
        <p>Highlights of the education plan proposed by Representative Rick A. Lazio</p>
        <p>TEACHER RECRUITMENT -- $5.75 billion</p>
        <p>Loan Forgiveness -- Full tuition forgiveness for top college students who become certified and agree to teach for three years in fields like math or in certain regions or in failing schools.</p>
        <p>Alternative Certification -- $250 million  Use federal funds to grant alternative teaching certificates to help identify people who could work as teachers.</p>
        <p>Mentoring to Novice Teachers -- $500 million  Grants to districts that require new teachers to have mentors in the same field for three years.</p>
        <p>TEACHER TESTING -- $5 billion  Encourage districts to test teachers' skills, offering incentives for competency testing every five years.</p>
        <p>SPECIAL EDUCATION -- $60 billion  Provide $60 billion in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act grants to states over 10 years.</p>
        <p>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY -- $4 billion  Establish a $3 billion revolving fund to ensure schools have the ability to keep current in teaching technology and science. The other $1 billion should be invested in math and science areas in public schools.</p>
        <p>SCHOOL VOUCHERS -- $5 billion  Give ''opportunity scholarships,'' essentially vouchers, to children in failing schools that students could use to transfer to another public or private school.</p>
        <p>FLEXIBLE FUNDS -- $10 billion  Proposes creating a ''Hometown Choice'' grant program to let local schools and parents choose how to spend federal dollars.</p>
        <p>SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION -- $5 billion  Spend $5 billion for school construction and renovation, leveraging about $50 billion. Legislation would increase private bond availability to allow construction of new schools.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 13, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about Representative Rick A. Lazio's plan for new education spending if he is elected senator misstated the total for new spending on education proposed by his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton's proposals, taken together, would cost $129.6 billion over 10 years, not $123 billion.</p>
