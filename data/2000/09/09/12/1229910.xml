        <p>The driver-side air bags on 115 Oldsmobile and Buick cars have inflated spontaneously when the car was started or during normal driving conditions, and 268,000 cars in the 1995 and 1996 model years are vulnerable to the problem, General Motors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>But G.M. has not recalled the vehicles because it does not have replacement parts.</p>
        <p>''It is taking longer than would be optimal,'' said Terry Rhadigan, a spokesman for the company, who said that G.M. was working with new suppliers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhadigan said the company had received 60 reports of injuries, ''primarily abrasions and bruises.'' None of the injuries had been serious, he said, and no crashes had resulted from the air-bag deployments, which were caused by corrosion on a wire linked to the air bag inflator.</p>
        <p>The company hoped to be ready to begin replacements by the end of the year. In a letter to its dealers, G.M. said that the inflator modules were ''complex, precision devices with many parts,'' explaining why it would take months to build replacements.</p>
        <p>The problem affects 1995 Buick Regals and 1995 and 1996 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes, according to G.M., which sent letters to car owners in July explaining the situation.</p>
        <p>There is nothing a driver can do to prevent the air bag from deploying, the company said, although in some cases there may be a warning: the red ''air bag'' light on the dashboard that usually flashes when the car is started may come on and stay lighted. In that case, G.M. said, the driver should stop and have the car towed.</p>
        <p>Under federal rules, a driver can apply to the Transportation Department to have an on-off switch installed on the air-bag system, but G.M. thinks that driving without an air bag would be an even greater risk, Mr. Rhadigan said.</p>
        <p>Drivers should follow the instructions in the owners' manual and sit as far back from the air bag as possible, according to G.M.</p>
        <p>The problem does not affect passenger-side air bags, he said.</p>
