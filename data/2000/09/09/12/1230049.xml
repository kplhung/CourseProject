        <p>This is a crucial week for the MetroStars. Before they play host to the Dallas Burn in the first round of the playoffs on Friday night at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the MetroStars will meet the Miami Fusion in the semifinals of the United States Open Cup tonight at Mitchel Field in Uniondale, N.Y. A victory would put the MetroStars in the final against the Chicago Fire, giving the MetroStars a chance to win the American double -- the Open Cup and the M.L.S. Cup.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars (seeded No. 3 in the M.L.S. playoffs) made a remarkable turnaround this season, moving from last to third and winning the league's Eastern Division. The MetroStars will have trouble on defense if Lothar Matthaus cannot play this week. He is questionable with a hamstring injury suffered in the 4-3 loss to New England in the regular-season finale on Saturday.</p>

        <p>This is a crucial week for the MetroStars. Before they play host to the Dallas Burn in the first round of the playoffs on Friday night at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., the MetroStars will meet the Miami Fusion in the semifinals of the United States Open Cup tonight at Mitchel Field in Uniondale, N.Y. A victory would put the MetroStars in the final against the Chicago Fire, giving the MetroStars a chance to win the American double -- the Open Cup and the M.L.S. Cup.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars (seeded No. 3 in the M.L.S. playoffs) made a remarkable turnaround this season, moving from last to third and winning the league's Eastern Division. The MetroStars will have trouble on defense if Lothar Matthaus cannot play this week. He is questionable with a hamstring injury suffered in the 4-3 loss to New England in the regular-season finale on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Matthaus said the injury was related to a nerve that caused spasms in his back two months ago and forced him to miss several games. Matthaus left the game in the 21st minute against New England and the MetroStars' defense fell apart without him.</p>
        <p>In Clint Mathis (16 goals, 14 assists for 46 points), Adolfo Valencia (16, 9, 42 points) and Alex Comas (13, 6, 32 points), the MetroStars are the only team in M.L.S. to have three players among the league's top 10 scorers, but only Comas has been playing well now. Mathis is having the worst time of the three. He failed to convert many chances in the past two games and he missed a penalty kick against the Revolution.</p>
        <p>In other first-round matches, Colorado (No. 8) will face Kansas City (No. 1), New England (No. 7) plays Chicago (No. 2), and Tampa Bay (No. 4) plays Los Angeles (No. 5). Colorado's 1-0 overtime victory over Los Angeles on Paul Bravo's goal in the 97th minute determined the playoff fate of five teams. The Rapids' victory eliminated Miami and Columbus from the playoff race.</p>
        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>The round-robin group stage of the 32-team Champions League, the most prestigious club competition in Europe, begins today.</p>
        <p>The early favorites are Italy's Lazio, the defending champion Read Madrid of Spain, England's Manchester United and Germany's Bayern Munich.</p>
        <p>Lazio is one of the favorites. During the off-season it added the Argentine Hernan Crespo, who was transferred from Parma for $54.6 million, and Claudio Lopez from Valencia. The Spanish club eliminated Lazio in the quarterfinals last season before losing to Real Madrid in the final. With Juventus and AC Milan in the tournament, the Italian presence will be strong.</p>
        <p>Spain's three semifinalists from last season, Barcelona, Valencia and Real Madrid, are joined by the country's champion Deportivo La Coruna, while England's Manchester United is joined by Arsenal and Leeds United.</p>
        <p>Bayern Munich will be joined by Hamburg and Bayer Leverkusen as the challengers from Germany. Along with Turkey's Galatasaray, Ukraine's Dynamo Kiev and France's Paris Saint-Germain, the German clubs are in a position for upsets.</p>
        <p>Real Madrid's visit to Sporting Lisbon, Lazio's visit to Shaktar Donetsk and Arsenal playing at Spartak Prague highlight today's matches. Manchester United playing host to Anderlecht, Helsinborg at Bayern Munich, Hamburg at Juventus, and Barcelona at Leeds United are the top matches tomorrow.</p>
        <p>COLLEGES</p>
        <p>St. John's suffered its first loss of the season, a 1-0 decision to Pittsburgh on a goal by Chad Porter nine minutes into the game.</p>
        <p>U.C.L.A. (3-0) and Penn State (4-0) are the nation's top two ranked teams among the men, while North Carolina (6-0) is ranked first among the women. Notre Dame (5-0) is second and Nebraska (6-0) third. The UConn women, who were ranked sixth last week, dropped to No. 20 after losses to Stanford and Santa Clara.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>After working the Women's World Cup in 1999, Sandra Hunt of the United States was appointed by FIFA to referee the Brazil-Sweden women's game tomorrow that will mark the first official event of the 2000 Olympics. Hunt was one of the first female officials in Major League Soccer. ... The United States Soccer Federation announced yesterday that fewer than 4,000 tickets remain for the World Cup qualifying game against Costa Rica Oct. 11 in Columbus, Ohio. ... The Minnesota Thunder gave more evidence of their superiority in the A-League with a 7-0 trouncing of the Indiana Blast in the first round of the playoffs en route to defending their title. ... The 42-year-old Bernie James of the A-League's Seattle Sounders announced his retirement after 22 years as a professional.</p>
