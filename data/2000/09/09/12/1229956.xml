        <p>When thousands of car owners  complained in the 1980's and 1990's that their Fords unexpectedly stalled, often on highways and while making left turns across oncoming traffic, top company executives repeatedly assured regulators that there was no way to know what might be causing the problem.</p>
        <p>But throughout the period, Ford documents show, the company's engineers, safety officials and even its board were aware of growing problems with one particular part -- a computerized ignition system attached to the engine's distributor -- that would shut the engine down if it got too hot.</p>
        <p>Even as federal investigators opened and closed five investigations based on Ford's assurances that it knew of no particular defect, the company never provided regulators with more than a dozen documents that would have shed light on the problem.</p>
        <p>On the same day in 1986 when the regulators closed their second investigation based on Ford's assurances that there was nothing defective to warrant a recall, members of the company's board meeting in a private session discussed the rising number of service complaints about the part, according to Ford documents.</p>
        <p>Also that day, Ford officials prepared a memo raising questions about the company's plan to continue attaching the system, known as a thick film ignition, or T.F.I. module, to the engine in a future model in light of the problems and complaints.</p>
        <p>Neither the notes from the board meeting nor the Ford memo was ever provided to federal investigators. Ford continued to deny there were problems for the next nine years, in spite of repeated internal company studies, consumer complaints, numerous reports of deadly and other serious accidents, wrongful death and personal injury lawsuits and warranty claims that topped 40 percent in some years.</p>
        <p>The company, which denies the defect has caused any fatal accidents, has settled at least four lawsuits involving serious injuries and at least four deaths. A study prepared for the plaintiffs in one case asserts that the drivers of the 22 million cars equipped with the ignition system faced a 9 percent greater chance of being in a fatal crash. Ford contests that finding but stopped putting ignitions on distributors after the 1995 model year.</p>
        <p>The company's handling of complaints about the ignition system -- detailed in court papers, as well as interviews with witnesses, safety experts, government officials and lawyers -- has taken on new significance in light of the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires after dozens of deadly crashes involving Ford Explorers.</p>
        <p>In recent days, documents have emerged showing that the companies were aware of problems with Explorers equipped with the tires several years before the recall.</p>
        <p>Congressional investigators are now examining whether the ignition case is part of a broader pattern in which Ford misled regulators by failing to disclose what its engineers and safety experts know of possible defects.</p>
        <p>Alan J. Kam, a recently retired official at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in an interview that in his 21 years as the agency's top lawyer for defects and enforcement issues, he had never seen a greater deception perpetuated on the government by an auto company.</p>
        <p>''When I looked at this material I was astonished,'' said Mr. Kam, who has been retained as an expert witness for the victims and is preparing an affidavit outlining his views that will be filed in a case in Tennessee.</p>
        <p>''Ford Motor Company had obfuscated the existence of the T.F.I. module problems even though it had problems on a massive basis,'' he said. ''They had concealed signs of failures that were occurring at an astronomical level, at a figure far beyond any measure I have seen before. They were telling the agency they didn't know what was causing stalling while they were doing extensive studies showing they knew what was causing the stalling.''</p>
        <p>The ignition cases have been described in news reports. But Mr. Kam's involvement in the case and many of the Ford internal documents Congressional investigators are now studying have not been previously disclosed.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, a state court judge in California concluded in a tentative decision in a class-action lawsuit involving the ignition system that Ford had engaged in a huge corporate cover-up, concealing from both regulators and consumers a design flaw affecting 22 million cars produced between 1983 and 1995, almost 15 million of which remain on the road.</p>
        <p>If, as expected, he makes the decision final in the next few weeks, the judge will become the first in American history to order an auto recall. Such a ruling combined with other damages could cost Ford as much as $3.5 billion in California alone.</p>
        <p>Cases are also pending in five other states, and like the tire recall, Ford faces the prospect of action abroad, where tens of millions of autos are on the roads with the ignition part affixed to the distributor.</p>
        <p>Ford executives and lawyers say they intend to appeal the ignition case if the judge's decision becomes final. They said the judge had no basis for reaching his conclusions of cover-up and liability and exceeded his authority by ordering a recall. Ford executives said the only similarity between the ignition and tire cases is that company officials did nothing improper and took necessary steps to correct any problems.</p>
        <p>Warren Platt, a Ford lawyer, said that in the tire case, Ford was under no legal obligation to report on problems being encountered abroad. And in the ignition case, he said, the company's position is that there were many possible causes of cars stalling on the road beyond problems with the ignition module.</p>
        <p>''The frequency of the stalls caused by a T.F.I. failure were not nearly as large as a number of other factors,'' he said. ''N.H.T.S.A. looked at the adequacy of our filings and with the exception of seven documents that Ford didn't produce, it found that we produced all that was required. It's hard to argue that Ford has been less than forthcoming.''</p>
        <p>In court papers outlining its legal defense, Ford maintained that the module was far more reliable than earlier ignition systems and there had not been an inordinate number of accidents caused by cars that stalled. The company said there were sound engineering reasons for putting the module on the distributor, and that the company corrected any problems by replacing more than one million parts under warranty.</p>
        <p>Moreover, while there was a high rate of warranty claims filed over the ignition module, Ford executives testified that nearly 90 percent of the parts replaced were found not to be defective.</p>
        <p>Ford's handling of the ignition complaints points up the shortcomings of a regulatory system that, short of manpower, relies heavily on the candor of the auto companies.</p>
        <p>The penalties for failing to disclose defects to federal auto regulators are not onerous. In the ignition case, the highway safety agency concluded two years ago that Ford had improperly withheld important documents but declined to impose any penalties at all, in part because the cars were no longer covered by federal laws on recalls sponsored by a manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Documents that have been made public in recent months show that in both the tire and ignition cases, Ford executives knew about increasing consumer complaints and accidents surrounding the parts. In both cases, regulators were not immediately told of the complaints.</p>
        <p>Although the leadership of the company has since changed hands, some of the same Ford executives, including the company's top executive for safety issues, Helen O. Petrauskas, have been involved in both cases.</p>
        <p>And in both cases, the company followed its practice of settling personal-injury and wrongful-death lawsuits raising safety concerns by requiring that the cases be sealed and that the plaintiffs return all incriminating company documents to Ford. In some cases, the settling parties had to also agree that they would take no steps to assist plaintiffs in other cases who assert similar claims.</p>
        <p>''The objective in both the tire and the ignition cases was to avoid a costly recall in the United States, to handle costly defects through settlements in individual cases and then have those cases sealed,'' said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety and an unpaid expert witness for the plaintiffs in the ignition lawsuits. ''In both instances, Ford was under an obligation to self-report to N.H.T.S.A., and in both instances, Ford failed.''</p>
        <p>Michael E. Ballachey, the California Superior Court judge who ruled against Ford, blamed Ford for a corporate culture in which the careers of executives can be ruined by reporting design defects to higher-ups. The judge said, for instance, that the testimony in his case of a top Ford engineer's reluctance to convey bad news about the ignition module had reminded him of ''The Emperor's New Clothes.''</p>
        <p>''No one wanted to be the one to deliver the bad news to the president of Ford,'' Judge Ballachey wrote. ''That reluctance, and Ford's commitment to failed technology, cannot be accepted as a realistic attempt to solve the obvious safety problem confronting Ford: the massive failure of distributor-mounted T.F.I. modules due to excessive heat and thermal stress.''</p>
        <p>The ignition cases brought in California do not involve auto passengers who were injured or killed, but were filed as fraud lawsuits that accuse the company of deceiving car owners about the safety of their products.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they decided, as a matter of strategy, not to pursue claims for death or injury. Engines that stall can often be restarted after cooling down, making it difficult to establish to a legal certainty that a particular accident was caused by an ignition defect.</p>
        <p>In the California case, Judge Ballachey ordered Ford to disclose details of several sealed lawsuits. One of these cases involved an April 14, 1990 accident. Andy Pham, a 19-year-old who rented a 1990 Mercury Sable in San Jose was driving to Reno with seven passengers when his car stalled, hit the center divider and rolled over and crashed off the road. Mr. Pham and two others died in the crash. Another passenger, Asali Johnson, was left a quadriplegic while the other passengers suffered less severe injuries.</p>
        <p>At the center of the case is the T.F.I. module, which Judge Ballachey described as ''delicate electronic, computer-driven technology,''  prone to shutting down at high temperatures. It was placed near the engine on a number of Ford models,  from 1983 to 1995 and including some makes of the Bronco, Escort, Grand Marquis, Mustang, Sable, Taurus, Tempo, Thunderbird, Topaz and Town Car.</p>
        <p>Although some Ford engineers and officials argued that early electronic ignitions be placed inside the passenger compartment of vehicles in part to eliminate exposure to high temperatures, Ford rejected that approach.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Fazio, the San Francisco lawyer who has been the driving force behind the cases, said the Ford documents uncovered in the litigation detail years of concern about the part. Most of the documents were never provided to federal traffic safety officials during their investigations.</p>
        <p>In 1981, the documents show, the company decided against mounting the ignition system away from the engine in future models ''for cost/ function reasons.''</p>
        <p>As early as April 1982, Ford engineers began to raise concerns about overheating of the ignition module.</p>
        <p>A warranty analysis in January 1984 projected that the ignition module -- which was supposed to last for the lifetime of the vehicle -- would fail at a rate of 56 percent at five years or 50,000 miles.</p>
        <p>In May of that year, Ford engineers compiled a list of components that could cause a ''quits on road'' condition -- a failure that causes the vehicle to shut down while being driven. The document questioned whether a recall was necessary.</p>
        <p>The company continued to tell the safety agency there was no ''common pattern or cause'' behind the complaints about stalling.</p>
        <p>In July 1985, Ford executives were told that a special company task force was studying why the ignition module and another part failed in ''hot climates'' within warranty and more temperate climates after the warranty expired.</p>
        <p>In October 1986, federal safety officials, relying on such Ford assurances, shut down their second investigation. That same day, the company's directors began to raise questions about the high costs of fixing the module.</p>
        <p>Although the module was one of 14,000 parts of the car, costs of replacing it threatened to eat up more than $200 million of the $350 million that Ford had reserved for all warranty claims.</p>
        <p>In November 1986, a month after that meeting, Ford executives prepared a report on the issue for the company's top management, including Harold A. Poling, then the chairman. But according to testimony in the case, Mr. Poling never received the report, although he and other executives learned of many of its details.</p>
        <p>The study noted the nodule's high rate of failure at hot temperatures. It said that 4.3 million vehicles in model years 1984 and 1985 were at risk of ignition problems and that about 500,000 already had their modules replaced at the owners' expense.</p>
        <p>A survey of Ford customers who reported stalling found that 66 percent had their cars towed because of the module's failure and 29 percent ''experienced a T.F.I.-related failure that caused the engine to quit while the vehicle was in motion.''</p>
        <p>At that point, company officials recognized that the potential cost to an across-the-board fix would be staggering, more than $429 million. The company also concluded that such a fix was ''not feasible'' because they did not have enough replacement parts and opted for a ''selective notification,'' even though executives recognized it would leave many cars on the roads that would continue to ''quit on road.''</p>
        <p>Even after the limited notification program, which affected slightly over one million cars, executives continued to raise concerns about the placement of the module on the distributor. In a July 1988 memo, officials in the electrical and electronic division said they were ''concerned about long-term customer satisfaction due to the anticipated high T.F.I. module operating temperatures.''</p>
        <p>''As you are aware,'' the memo said, ''the failure mode for the T.F.I. module under these conditions is a quits-on-road.''</p>
        <p>''We have reviewed this subject with you in the past, and we understand the cost pressures,'' it concluded. ''However, this posture is not consistent with company quality goals.''</p>
        <p>A list of Ford vehicles that plaintiffs say have stalling problems caused by an ignition module is available at The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/business</p>
