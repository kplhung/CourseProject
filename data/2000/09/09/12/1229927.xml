        <p>Op-Ed article by former US ambassador James Lilley says government's handling of Wen Ho Lee case that eventually forced it to drop virtually all espionage-related accusations against former Los Alamos Nuclear Laboratory scientist, underscores that it must rethink how it deals with central conflict between democratic principles and national security; says Chinese-Americans are, as result, quite right to raise alarms about racial profling in weapons laboratories (M)</p>

        <p>The case of Wen Ho Lee is coming to an end, with the government backing off on virtually all the accusations against him. But the underlying problems of the case are unlikely to disappear once it is resolved, and the government must rethink how it deals with the central conflict between democratic principles and national security.</p>
        <p>Chinese-Americans were quite right to raise alarms about ethnic profiling in weapons laboratories. The accusations of racism and ethnic targeting of foreign-born scientists have poisoned the atmosphere at the National Security Agency and the national laboratories, including Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. Asian-Americans have been leaving the labs, partly because of higher salaries offered elsewhere, but also because they are worried about discrimination and heavy-handed new security measures.</p>
        <p>But in our laudable effort to avoid racial profiling, we must not damage our national security by painting a benign picture of China's espionage techniques. It is an established fact that China tries to recruit ethnic Chinese in the United States, particularly those who may be vulnerable to seduction, payoffs, appeals to nationalism and, in some cases, coercion. A 361-page book put out by China's intelligence office in 1991, and obtained by the Far Eastern Economic Review, described how China maintains a thorough system of gathering intelligence abroad for military purposes, aimed primarily at the United States. Representative Christopher Cox updated this information in his 1999 report on China's espionage efforts. In the spy business, targeting ethnic groups is widespread; the Soviets went after Russian emigres for years.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Eftimiades in his 1994 book ''Chinese Intelligence Operations'' describes China's efforts to collect technology -- information on night-vision equipment, blueprints for F-14 fighter aircraft -- from ethnic Chinese agents in the United States.</p>
        <p>China has been accused of recruiting agents in a number of cases. In 1985, Larry Wu-Tai Chin, a C.I.A. analyst, was charged with passing secrets to the Chinese Government for 40 years (he committed suicide in jail).  Peter Lee, an American scientist at TRW, was accused of passing submarine detection technology to China. Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles said they wanted to charge Mr. Lee with espionage but were unable to, partly because Navy officials in Washington would not allow testimony about the technology in an open court.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Cox report states that Johnny Chung, a Chinese-American at the center of the campaign finance affair involving the Democratic Party, was given $300,000 by two Chinese military officials in a purported attempt to acquire American technology and to help the Democratic National Committee.</p>
        <p>Of course, the fact that China tries to recruit spies doesn't mean that Chinese-Americans as a group should be suspect. When Mr. Cox released his report, he said the Energy Department had demonized Wen Ho Lee, and his study did not mention the Los Alamos scientist.</p>
        <p>To catch any spy requires good investigative work. Chinese intelligence methods are complex and arcane, and special skills and experience are needed to detect them. What seems to be missing on our side is the painstaking, timely investigative use of wiretaps, computer access, independent surveillance and informers.</p>
        <p>Instead the government prematurely leveled a lengthy indictment at Wen Ho Lee, Chinese-Americans have been harassed, and evidence has disappeared. What is needed to regain trust among Asian-Americans are fair, scrupulous and professional investigations; we cannot allow poorly handled cases to alienate a segment of our population.</p>
