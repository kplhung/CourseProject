        <p>United Nations meetings are famous for accomplishing nothing concrete, and some observers have cited last week's millennium forum as a prime example. Still, Secretary General Kofi Annan could rightly claim that he gained a measure of support for one of his most ambitious and controversial proposals: that the United Nations regularly intervene in civil wars when the human stakes are high. President Clinton came as close as he has come to endorsing the idea, and other leaders embraced, in vaguer terms, a toughened U.N. role in imploding states.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Mr. Annan's idea sometimes argue that intervening in intrastate conflict is no great departure from the U.N.'s founding doctrines -- that the Charter of 1945 leaves plenty of room for reaching inside a nation to stop slaughter or the widespread abuse of human rights. As Mr. Annan himself put it when he unveiled the idea last year, ''Nothing in the Charter precludes a recognition that there are rights beyond borders.''  Maybe not, but for practical purposes this sentence comes pretty close: ''Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.''</p>

        <p>United Nations meetings are famous for accomplishing nothing concrete, and some observers have cited last week's millennium forum as a prime example. Still, Secretary General Kofi Annan could rightly claim that he gained a measure of support for one of his most ambitious and controversial proposals: that the United Nations regularly intervene in civil wars when the human stakes are high. President Clinton came as close as he has come to endorsing the idea, and other leaders embraced, in vaguer terms, a toughened U.N. role in imploding states.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Mr. Annan's idea sometimes argue that intervening in intrastate conflict is no great departure from the U.N.'s founding doctrines -- that the Charter of 1945 leaves plenty of room for reaching inside a nation to stop slaughter or the widespread abuse of human rights. As Mr. Annan himself put it when he unveiled the idea last year, ''Nothing in the Charter precludes a recognition that there are rights beyond borders.''  Maybe not, but for practical purposes this sentence comes pretty close: ''Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.''</p>
        <p>As an unabashed one-worlder, I don't mean to say that the United Nations should never intervene in a civil war, or that there is no conceivable legal basis for doing so. The Charter is a sometimes ambiguous document, and, rather as the United States Supreme Court ultimately decides what the Constitution means, the Security Council decides what qualifies as a threat to ''international peace and security'' -- the threshold that justifies the use of force.</p>
        <p>But the fact remains that the United Nations was designed to stop war between nations, not within them. Those who want a systematic broadening of this mandate would do well first to ponder the logic behind the more modest aims of the organization's founders. Otherwise, they could wind up further damaging its perilously low credibility.</p>
        <p>One virtue of the founders' focus on interstate conflict is the relative ease of assigning blame: any nation that violates another nation's border is  subject to collective retaliation. Sometimes, to be sure, identifying the bad guys in internal conflicts is similarly simple. (When men are hacking off the arms of children, raping women and looting homes, that's a clue.) But often things are murkier. So the consistent punishment of transgressors is even harder in intrastate wars than in interstate wars.</p>
        <p>Of course, actually administering the punishment is no picnic in either  case. But, with interstate wars, it has gotten easier. The evolution of ''smart'' weapons, by letting an advanced military force wreak massive damage while sustaining little, has lowered a longstanding barrier to fulfilling the United Nations' mission: the reluctance of even right-minded nations to risk lives when their territory isn't immediately threatened.</p>
        <p>These smart bombs and missiles are much less valuable in the usual internal conflict. Witness their mixed record in the Kosovo intervention. Yes, they brought Slobodan Milosevic to his knees by decimating Serbia's infrastructure. But they had little effect in Kosovo itself, where the enemy possessed no distinct, sizable territory and no fixed industrial base -- where, in short, the enemy resembled the enemy in many intrastate wars.</p>
        <p>The United Nations Charter's focus on interstate war was due partly to political reality: the need to get the Charter signed in the first place. It is one thing for a nation to agree not to fight another nation except in self-defense. It is another thing to agree that, should internal rebellion arise, the government's response will be subject to Security Council approval. This tension persists. Nations that face internal turmoil -- Russia, for example -- may not back the United Nations in halting transborder aggression if they consider a strong U.N. a threat within their borders.</p>
        <p>Of course, the main reason the founders of the United Nations focused on interstate conflict was their memory of the immediate past: four years of horrendous world war. But they were also moved by images of the future: a nuclear world, in which war among nations could make World War II look like a dustup. It is easy to forget, especially in good economic times, that we still live in such a world.</p>
        <p>The good news is that reaching the essential goal of the United Nations -- collective action to stop cross-border wars -- is more practical now than during the cold war. The rollback of Iraqi aggression in the Persian Gulf war, explicitly authorized by Security Council vote, showed as much. Still, even this challenge is hardly mastered. Mr. Milosevic's orchestration of savagery in Bosnia was technically a case of transborder aggression, since Bosnia had gained its sovereignty and joined the United Nations, but his campaign met no forceful international resistance for years.</p>
        <p>If world leaders want the United Nations to address intrastate conflict seriously, that's fine with me. But they should brace themselves. This will involve, for starters, a standing United Nations army (perhaps an all-volunteer army, to make casualties politically tolerable at the national level). It will involve not just ''peacekeeping,'' but peacemaking -- deciding who the bad guys are and then killing them until a white flag appears.</p>
        <p>Finally, it will involve picking fights carefully. To define a goal of suppressing all intrastate war is, for both political and military reasons, hopelessly unrealistic, a recipe for the further loss of United Nations credibility. And credibility could be crucial when it comes time to perform the  original mission -- to prevent or halt transborder aggression in, say, the now-nuclear South Asia.</p>
        <p>''Humanitarian intervention'' is the name for U.N. involvement in intrastate wars. But preventing interstate war is also humanitarian. The founding, thoroughly humanitarian insight of the United Nations is that, in a nuclear world, ending war between nations is job one. Today -- when, for the first time in history, that goal may be reachable -- it would be a shame to lose sight of it.</p>
