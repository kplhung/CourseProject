        <p>John R. Gambling, the host of a talk show that had been heard on WOR-AM radio continuously for 75 years, went off the air yesterday, prompting an outpouring of calls and e-mail messages from listeners upset at the passing of an institution in New York radio.</p>
        <p>''Rambling With Gambling,'' the morning program started by Mr. Gambling's grandfather, John B. Gambling, in 1925 and later presided over by his father, offered a low-key and amiable alternative to more provocative radio fare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gambling's departure stunned the radio industry. Tom Taylor, the editor of M Street Daily, a radio newsletter, said, ''It's a little bit like driving through Midtown and seeing that one of the lions in front of the public library is missing.''</p>
        <p>Since taking over the show as co-host in 1985, Mr. Gambling had continued the tradition of news, interviews and lighthearted talk that began with his grandfather during the early days of radio. The program withstood assaults by new formats and changing musical tastes.</p>
        <p>But Robert Bruno, WOR's vice president and general manager, said that ''Rambling With Gambling,'' though successful, had a disproportionate number of listeners who were older than 54, the upper limit of the age group that advertisers are most eager to reach. ''We knew it was the right decision for the station,'' said Mr. Bruno, ''no matter how painful and wrenching it would be for John, for us and certainly for our listeners.'' He said that the station had heard from about 2,000 of the program's unhappy fans yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gambling, 50, said yesterday that he had received an ''overwhelming'' number of sympathetic calls and messages, including from dignitaries like Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He said four advertisers had told him they would stop buying time on the station.</p>
        <p>The station's decision not to renew his contract, which he learned about last week, caught Mr. Gambling off guard, he said. He started working for WOR 22 years ago as a station announcer and joined his father, John A. Gambling, as co-host of ''Rambling With Gambling'' in 1985. He has been sole host of the show since 1990, when his father retired.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gambling said he offered something that is increasingly rare. ''Most of radio is angry, most of broadcasting,'' he said. ''I don't understand it. It doesn't need to be. Why is everybody so angry? I'm not. I think there is a huge population that's not angry, and those are the people who listen to me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno said that Mr. Gambling could have remained on the program until the end of the year, but decided to make a more abrupt exit after station executives told him their decision was irrevocable.</p>
        <p>Radio industry analysts said most talk shows drew an older audience. ''I don't think that younger people find them that relevant to their lives,'' said Thom Moon, director of research and development at Duncan's American Radio, a Cincinnati company. He said that advertisers prefer to reach younger listeners because they ''are convinced that once you hit 50, you never change your brand of anything.''</p>
        <p>Avoiding hot-button topics, the Gambling show was comfortable and nonthreatening, said Mr. Taylor, the newsletter editor. ''It was like your favorite pair of shoes,'' he said. He said that WOR was taking a risk that it will alienate loyal listeners without picking up new ones. ''People are saying variations of, 'My mom called me today in tears,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruno said he was determined not to lose the older listeners and had no intention of replacing Mr. Gambling with someone like Howard Stern, or making other big changes. He said the new program would probably have two hosts and feature more live guests, more defined subject matter (that is, less rambling) and more calls from listeners.</p>
        <p>''We want to pick up the pace,'' Mr. Bruno said. ''We know we have a niche in the marketplace. We're not dirty talk, or all sports or all news. We're not edgy, but we're a good place to come for your information presented in an entertaining way.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gambling said he was already talking to other potential employers and hoped to be back on the air shortly. Meanwhile, he said, he would establish a Web site to keep in touch with his listeners and pursue other business interests.</p>
        <p>And how does he feel about the station that employed three generations of his family? ''I'm not angry,'' he said. ''I'm disappointed that it ended on their terms.''</p>
