        <p>Ask people on Martha's Vineyard about insects and they are likely to talk about mosquitoes, no-see-ums and green-headed flies, all of which can make life miserable here. But the island's insect population comprises far more than pests. In fact, entomologists hope to use it to re-establish rare and endangered insect populations wiped out elsewhere in New England years ago.</p>
        <p>This year, beach tiger beetles, tiny ivory insects with brown markings, were gathered on a stretch of private beach here and transported to Monomoy Island National Wildlife Refuge  at the elbow of Cape Cod, where entomologists hope they have taken hold.</p>
        <p>Next on the entomologists' list is the imperial moth, a yellow and brown insect once abundant throughout New England that was all but wiped out by DDT. Entomologists are studying it now, hoping to determine the best places to reintroduce it. After that, the scientists hope the Vineyard will provide still more moth species to repopulate their ancient New England habitats.</p>
        <p>In all cases, said Tim Simmons, restoration ecologist for the Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program, the idea is to identify past insect habitats that remain protected enough to enable transplants to survive.</p>
        <p>The beach tiger beetle, only half an inch long but prized by collectors for its delicate spots and stripes and bright green abdomen, was eradicated from almost all of its New England range when four-wheel-drive vehicles began taking to the region's beaches. The beetle lays its eggs on the beach, and its larvae live in tubes the beetles dig in the sand -- no match for all-terrain vehicles.</p>
        <p>Originally, entomologists planned to reintroduce the beetle to Monomoy last year, by digging larvae and transplanting them to beaches there. But when they went collecting, they discovered that the beetle's volatile population had declined, for reasons still uncertain. This year, the numbers were better, so the project went ahead.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paul Goldstein, a biologist at the Field Museum in Chicago who is studying the state of Vineyard lepidoptera this summer along with ecologists at the Sheriff's Meadow Foundation, a major Vineyard conservation organization, said the work on the beetle was conducted by Dr. Phil Nothnagle, an entomologist who is an authority on it.</p>
        <p>''He excavated about two dozen larvae, which is small for an insect population, but that's all we were comfortable taking,'' Dr. Goldstein said. He added: ''Past experience shows introducing adults doesn't work. Either they don't find each other or they don't lay eggs.''</p>
        <p>Though it is too soon to say the effort is a success, Mr. Simmons said in a telephone interview that five adult beetles had already been spotted on Monomoy.</p>
        <p>Widespread spraying of DDT did in the imperial moth, Mr. Simmons said. The moth, whose tan-spotted yellow wings stretch more than three inches, once ranged from Canada to Argentina, but now the only place in New England where it survives is Martha's Vineyard.</p>
        <p>That the moth survives there is partly a legacy of the late Henry Beetle Hough, the longtime editor of The Vineyard Gazette and an ardent opponent of the use of insecticides, which he habitually referred to in editorials as ''poison.''</p>
        <p>''The continued widespread use of poisons, particularly through aerial spraying, will lead to results that cannot be foreseen -- except that life, the indivisible wellspring of all life on earth, will never be the same again,'' Mr. Hough editorialized in 1958.</p>
        <p>At his urging, residents of the island banded together to block widespread spraying, particularly of DDT. A few thousand Vineyard acres were sprayed, but only once, while elsewhere in New England hundreds of thousands of acres were routinely subjected to a fog of DDT and kerosene. As a result, species survive here that have vanished elsewhere in the Northeast, experts say.</p>
        <p>Among them are the imperial moth and other moths that live in highly specialized habitats, like depressions called frost bottoms, that are also rare everywhere but the Vineyard.</p>
        <p>Frost bottoms are a geological reminder of how Martha's Vineyard was formed more than 12,000 years ago as glaciers moved across New England, pushing rocks and soil before them. When they began to retreat, they left this material piled up in moraines, which gradually eroded and washed out to form sand plains. Much of Martha's Vineyard is formed of such sand plains. Glacial meltwater carved out the frost bottoms as it streamed south from moraines toward the sea.</p>
        <p>Though frost bottoms may be only 20 or 30 feet lower than the surrounding landscape, Dr. Goldstein said, they can be much warmer during the day and colder at night; some can experience frost year-round.</p>
        <p>Because few glacial outwash plains survive elsewhere, Martha's Vineyard's frost bottoms are extremely unusual.</p>
        <p>The Vineyard is not the only source of endangered insects for repopulation efforts. For example, entomologists are using a small population of burying beetles on Block Island, R.I., in efforts to re-establish the species, whose range was once from Maine to Texas.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein concedes that the insects he and others are eager to re-establish probably have little economic importance, although, as with most endangered species, it is always possible that one or another will turn out to be a valuable source of drugs or other useful compounds. But as conservation becomes more sophisticated, he said, more attention is being paid to restoring as many of a conservation area's original inhabitants as possible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simmons put it almost the same way, speaking of the beach tiger beetle. ''We suspect there are very few people who have ever experienced a wild beach that has all of its denizens,'' he said. ''It's sort of a symbol of what's supposed to be.''</p>
