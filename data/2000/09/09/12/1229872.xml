        <p>Fires in and around nuclear facilities understandably make people nervous. So this has been an unnerving summer in parts of the American West, where some of the wildfires that ravaged millions of acres also scorched several major nuclear complexes in New Mexico, Washington, Colorado and Idaho.</p>
        <p>When an out-of-control fire swept across the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, many people fled their homes, and it was not just the smoke and flames that sent them packing.</p>
        <p>Some worried that radioactivity would spread downwind. And some firefighters even refused to work around the lab, also fearing contamination, state and federal officials said. Similar concerns prompted 188 firefighters who battled blazes at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington to request tests to see if they had been exposed to radiation. So far, 35 tests have proven negative.</p>
        <p>During all these fires, government scientists monitored radiation and officials issued statements declaring that while there were elevated levels of radioactivity -- including minute amounts of plutonium at Hanford --  most of it was a natural result of burning vegetation, and there was no cause for concern.</p>
        <p>''Air and water sampling are the best methods for detecting any problems, and we have not found levels that would present a health risk,'' Ellen Livingston, a senior policy adviser on environmental management for the federal Energy Department, said after the fires were under control.</p>
        <p>Scientists outside the Energy Department who reviewed the air monitoring data from the fires at Los Alamos and Hanford agreed that there did not seem to be any cause for alarm.</p>
        <p>But the risks of radiation releases during and after wildfires at contaminated nuclear sites are still not very well understood by scientists, let alone the public. And distrust of government reassurances and a lack of perspective about radiation cause many people to fear the worst when contaminated sites catch fire.</p>
        <p>Such fears are not limited to the United States. When a fire broke out near Chernobyl in May, the Israeli embassy staff was evacuated from Minsk, 200 miles away, because of fear that the fire was burning in an area contaminated during the nuclear reactor meltdown there in 1986.</p>
        <p>''Those are valid concerns,'' said Dr. Ward Whicker, a professor of radiological health sciences at Colorado State University and a pioneer in the field or radioecology, the study of how radiation moves through the environment. ''There is not a lot of research available to help us quantitatively predict how much material might be released in a given fire.''</p>
        <p>Scientists at Los Alamos have been developing a program that uses supercomputers to predict the complex behavior of wildfires in different kinds of terrain, vegetation and wind conditions, a notoriously difficult task.</p>
        <p>The program was far enough along that, had it been used, the program might have alerted the National Park Service that conditions were not safe for the ''controlled burn'' the service started in May in nearby Bandelier National Monument, said Dr. Rodman R. Linn, one of the scientists working on the program.</p>
        <p>Such burns are intended to prevent wildfires, but this one spread out of control, devouring more than 47,000 acres and destroying more than 200 homes and some old structures on the grounds of the laboratory, where decades of nuclear weapons research was conducted.</p>
        <p>The program could also have been used to predict radioactive emissions caused by fires on the laboratory grounds. But it was not put to use, and Dr. Linn was evacuated along with other lab workers during the fire.</p>
        <p>The project has languished, Dr. Linn said, because scientific research on wildfires has not been a high priority. ''Even though the western half of the United States is burning up,'' he said, ''it's hard to get money for any kind of wildfire research.''</p>
        <p>When fire threatens a nuclear facility, the worst case scenario is if radioactive materials actually catch fire. That did not happen in any of the recent fires.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department, which oversees the nuclear complexes, has emergency management plans that include analyses of the risks a fire would pose at each one, Ms. Livingston said. Firebreaks are routinely cleared and local firefighters are trained on the sites.</p>
        <p>The Los Alamos lab completed an environmental impact statement just last year that included a wildfire assessment. As a result, the lab expanded a firebreak around its most vulnerable radioactive waste site, which protected it from the recent fire.</p>
        <p>''We were prepared,' Ms. Livingston said. ''And our ability to extinguish the fires at those sites under difficult weather conditions demonstrates that we took the right steps.''</p>
        <p>Given the troubled histories of some of the nation's nuclear facilities, however, it is not simply a matter of safeguarding the radioactive materials stored on site. The Energy Department has also evaluated the risk that fire could release radioactive elements that have contaminated the soil, grass, bushes and trees at its nuclear sites.</p>
        <p>At Hanford, the Energy Department routinely collects what workers call ''hot tumbleweeds,'' which grow in contaminated soil. To prevent the tumbleweeds from rolling off site or burning in a fire and releasing radioactivity, the department buries them.</p>
        <p>Still, even at contaminated sites, naturally occurring radon and other decay products of uranium contribute much more radiation to the atmosphere in wildfires than do manufactured radioactive elements taken up by plants from contaminated soil.</p>
        <p>According to the Energy Department, none of the fires this year exposed anyone to more than 1 to 2 millirems of radiation, and firefighters were the only people likely to be exposed to that much radiation.</p>
        <p>To put that into perspective, the average American is exposed to about 360 millirems of radiation per year, mostly from natural sources.</p>
        <p>While smoke from a wildfire at a nuclear site seems to cause the most immediate concern to nearby residents, the most significant problems may come after the fire is out.</p>
        <p>The risks associated with the spread of contaminated soil after a fire are much greater than the risks associated with radiation from burning contaminated vegetation, according to government studies. Radioactive contaminants in the soil can be picked up by wind or washed into streams and rivers by rain after the fire has scorched the earth, leaving bare ground vulnerable to erosion.</p>
        <p>In studies conducted at Rocky Flats and the Waste Isolation Pilot Project in Carlsbad, N.M., Dr. Whicker found that runoff from burned plots carried more radioactivity than runoff from unburned ones. In Los Alamos, crews have built dams to try to keep runoff from spreading contamination down denuded gullies to the Rio Grande.</p>
        <p>The risk that contamination will spread after a fire affects how much cleanup nuclear sites need to be made safe, said Dr. John Till, a radioecologist with the Risk Assessment Corporation in Neeses, S.C.</p>
        <p>Dr. Till completed a study last year to determine how much uranium and plutonium can be safely left in the ground at Rocky Flats, where it leaked from barrels of waste left over from making bombs. He found that a fire would greatly increase the amount of plutonium blowing downwind afterward with the dust. The exposure did not appear to extend beyond the boundaries, or present a health risk to people living around it. But it did mean a much more expensive cleanup would have to be done at Rocky Flats if people began moving onto the grassy plain, about 10 miles west of Denver, in the foreseeable future. The plutonium will remain radioactive for thousands of years.</p>
        <p>Dr. Till said it was important to have independent studies and monitoring, because of public skepticism about the Energy Department. ''The Department of Energy makes its statements about there being no risk, but there's always a question in people's minds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That is not surprising to Brian Kelly, a health physicist in Integrated Environmental Management, a consulting firm in Knoxville, Tenn. ''There is sort of a knee-jerk response when radiation is mentioned,'' he said. ''People almost get a visceral fear about what's going on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly's company has a Web site (www.iem-inc.com) on which people can ask a certified health physicist questions about radiation. During the fires, Mr. Kelly corresponded with numerous concerned people, including Marie Coburn, who grows organic echinacea, a medicinal herb, on a three-acre farm 30 miles northeast and downwind of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Ms. Coburn was concerned when the fire began sweeping through Los Alamos, scorching canyons contaminated with radioactive waste, and the smoke drifted her way.</p>
        <p>The sky turned orange and fuschia. ''I had a hard time breathing,'' Ms. Coburn said. Despite the statements of reassurance by the Energy Department and the New Mexico Department of Health, she fled.</p>
        <p>''I packed my truck thinking that I might never come back, that I might find out this area was like Chernobyl,'' she said. Nine neighbors evacuated with her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Coburn turned to the Internet for information because she distrusted the Energy Department and did not understand the radiation reports being reported in the media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly convinced Ms. Coburn that not only could she return home safely, she could also harvest her echinacea without worrying that she might be putting others at risk.</p>
        <p>Ms. Coburn washed off her crop. She borrowed a radiation detector and walked around her property, detecting nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
        <p>Ms. Coburn said she still does not trust the Los Alamos National Laboratory. But she has come to understand radiation better.</p>
        <p>''Radioactivity in itself is not something that is frightening,'' she said. ''We're in it all the time, and that's fine, as long as it doesn't soar to really high levels.''</p>
