        <p>Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham said today that their planned merger into one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies is again facing delay as American regulators examine their products to stop smoking.</p>
        <p>The Federal Trade Commission in Washington has requested additional information about Glaxo's prescription drug Zyban and SmithKline's over-the-counter Nicorette and Nicoderm products, the companies said.

        <p>Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham said today that their planned merger into one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies is again facing delay as American regulators examine their products to stop smoking.</p>
        <p>The Federal Trade Commission in Washington has requested additional information about Glaxo's prescription drug Zyban and SmithKline's over-the-counter Nicorette and Nicoderm products, the companies said. As a result, the completion of the $75 billion merger has been pushed back to year-end from Sept. 25.</p>
        <p>This is the second time that the two British drug producers have faced regulatory initiatives. Last month, they agreed to sell $2.9 billion worth of products to satisfy regulators. European antitrust authorities have since approved the merger.</p>
        <p>As part of that deal, Novartis of Switzerland is buying SmithKline's herpes treatments Famvir and Vectavir/Denavir for $1.63 billion, while another Swiss-based company, Roche Holding, is paying $1.23 billion for Kytril, a nausea-treatment drug for cancer patients.</p>
        <p>It is not surprising that the current round of scrutiny is coming from Washington, since the United States market for smoking-cessation products is far larger than Europe's, said Nigel Barnes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. What is surprising, he said, is that the F.T.C. is asking for more information at this late stage. Glaxo and SmithKline announced their merger in January and had originally expected to complete the deal by Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>Combinations of pharmaceutical companies are often complex for antitrust regulators, who examine not only products on the market, but also some in development that may not be available for years.</p>
        <p>Despite the delays, shareholders seemed not too pessimistic that the deal would in time be completed. Both stocks recovered some early losses here, with Glaxo ending 10 pence lower at $:19.10, or $26.89. SmithKline fell 9.5 pence, to $:8.635, or $12.16. ''These aren't major areas of fundamental concern,'' Mr. Barnes said. ''They are not deal-breaking issues. It's an irritation.''</p>
        <p>As mergers grow larger and more aggressive, regulatory agencies are playing an increasing role in what a combined company will look like as well as whether the deal is approved. How companies interact with regulators can often spell the difference between success and failure.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that the speedy sale of the herpes and nausea drugs showed European regulators that the two companies were willing to cooperate. Other areas that could come under scrutiny, analysts said, are antibiotics and drugs used against AIDS.</p>
