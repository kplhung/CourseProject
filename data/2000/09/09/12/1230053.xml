        <p>Although he had been at the Islanders' training camp less than 24 hours, by the time defenseman Roman Hamrlik stepped onto the ice yesterday at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid, N.Y., he felt like part of the team.</p>
        <p>The day before, the two-time All-Star had joined an unusual meeting between the owners Charles Wang and Sanjay Kumar and team members who successfully pleaded the case of the holdouts Brad Isbister and Zdeno Chara.</p>
        <p>''I've never experienced anything like that,'' said Hamrlik, who last week became the highest-paid Islander when he signed a four-year, $13 million contract. ''It was strange, but we need these guys. Now, everyone is happy the team is together.''</p>
        <p>So are Isbister and Chara, who drove up together Sunday night from Long Island after agreeing to one-year deals worth $385,000 and $632,000, respectively.</p>
