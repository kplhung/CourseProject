        <p>Dance Theater of Harlem's second program in its current season, which continues through Sunday at City Center, is an experiment in rethinking familiar material.</p>
        <p>Robert Garland's ''Return,'' a hilarious reinterpretation of recordings by James Brown and Aretha Franklin is now rightly a big hit, tightened up from the sketchy suite it was at its premiere last year.</p>
        <p>The second act of the company's revisionist production of ''Giselle'' was repeated on the same bill with major debuts. ''Creole Giselle,'' as this 1984 staging is called, needs both its acts to explain its 19th-century Louisiana locale. Nonetheless Caroline Rocher, the new ghost of Giselle in this act was splendid on Friday night as a womanly wraith with a voluptuous touch who movingly forgave her seducer, danced again by Kip Sturm.</p>
        <p>Leanne Codrington was the new and commanding Myrta, queen of the Wilis, or ghosts. Better danced than on opening night, this excerpt showed a fine coherence and Frederic Franklin's staging has none of the added detail from Soviet versions now standard in other productions.</p>
        <p>The evening began with ''The Four Temperaments,'' in an eloquent if debatable interpretation of the 1946 ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to a commissioned score by Paul Hindemith. Balanchine himself did some rethinking when he discarded the ballet's original neo-Baroque costumes for leotards and tights in 1951.</p>
        <p>Since then ''The Four Temperaments'' has been considered the granddaddy of Balanchine's avant-garde ''leotard'' ballets to modern music. The focus in such works in Balanchine's own New York City Ballet was always on pure movement: geometric, clear while convoluted and often inverting the steps of ballet's classical idiom.</p>
        <p>Yet Arthur Mitchell, Dance Theater of Harlem's artistic director and a former City Ballet star, has often said that he wanted his dancers to show more personality in these ballets than was sanctioned by Balanchine.</p>
        <p>All the more odd that Dance Theater of Harlem has often been cautious in its dancing of Balanchine. Not so on Friday: the dancers had more projection and added a strong emotional flavor both in the solos and in their relationship to one another.</p>
        <p>This is not the way ''The Four Temperaments'' has been performed by the company, and it is rarely so literally characterized by other companies. Nonetheless the temperaments of the title refer to the emotional states or humors of mankind as defined in the Middle Ages. The score's theme and variations, and also the choreography, can conjure up an abstraction of differing emotions.</p>
        <p>These qualities were also found in abstract ballets by Leonide Massine, a choreographer usually considered the opposite of Balanchine. Yet at this performance, a former dancer in the audience remarked that ''Four Temperaments'' reminded her of Massine, with whom she had performed. Hindemith's score, incidentally, is a recycling of music he had originally intended for Massine.</p>
        <p>The strong emotion that Dance Theater of Harlem now hears in the music may thus not be off the mark. The three couples in the opening theme section set up implicit dialogues that are rarely sensed when the movement is performed more clinically. It was startling to see Jarina Carvalho's sensual demeanor toward Don Bellamy in the third theme, and yet her tender looks over her shoulder and her sustained closeness to her partner's body decoded the romantic root in the music.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carvalho, a petite dancer of wonderful clarity, was startling but persuasive. The ever-assured Bethania Gomes and James Washington, as well as as Leslie Anne Cardona  and Mark Burns, opened the ballet with similar projection.</p>
        <p>Stronger classical technique was nonetheless needed in ''Sanguinic,'' the major duet, danced by Kellye A. Saunders and Mr. Sturm, and in ''Choleric'' with Tanya Wideman. The two male solos, backed up by small female ensembles, have less classical movement and their performers affect their movement. Kevin Thomas's ''Melancholic'' solo had athletic angst, less concerned with detail than getting tied up in knots. Donald Williams gave the ''Phlegmatic'' solo an unexpected power: in place of suggested lethargy, there was a convincing disjointedness. Michael Cherry was the solo pianist, with Joseph E. Fields conducting.</p>
        <p>For the first time the men are stronger classical dancers than the women in Dance Theater of Harlem. But all met on the same ground in ''Return'' Mr. Garland's mix of disco dance and ballet bravura. Paunika Jones led off with the right wiggle to ''Mother Popcorn,'' with Mr. Williams bringing the house down in imitation of a swiveling James Brown. Ms. Saunders joined him for a duet to ''Baby, Baby, Baby'' and ''I Got the Feelin' '' that had Ms. Jones flanked by the high-jumping Mr. Thomas and Ramon Thielen. With ''Call Me,'' Lenore Pavlakos moved from man to man as Aretha Franklin sang to her one and only on tape. ''Superbad'' offered a lively finale.</p>
