        <p>A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled that a former employee of the Saudi Mission to the United Nations who claimed that she was fired for espousing women's rights may sue for discrimination despite Saudi claims that her suit is barred under diplomatic immunity.</p>
        <p>The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court, held that the suit by Rajaa Al Mukaddam, who worked as a senior speechwriter in the Saudi Mission for 14 years before she was dismissed in 1998, fit a narrow exception to diplomatic immunity, opening the door to the possibility of monetary damages against the Saudis.</p>

        <p>A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled that a former employee of the Saudi Mission to the United Nations who claimed that she was fired for espousing women's rights may sue for discrimination despite Saudi claims that her suit is barred under diplomatic immunity.</p>
        <p>The judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court, held that the suit by Rajaa Al Mukaddam, who worked as a senior speechwriter in the Saudi Mission for 14 years before she was dismissed in 1998, fit a narrow exception to diplomatic immunity, opening the door to the possibility of monetary damages against the Saudis.</p>
        <p>Ms. Al Mukaddam, a naturalized United States citizen born in Lebanon, claimed in her lawsuit that she had also endured several years of sexual harassment and hostility from ''male fundamentalist members'' of the Saudi Mission, which increased after she complained.</p>
        <p>Ms. Al Mukaddam, whose age was not available, claims that she was abruptly fired after she made a presentation to the United Nations secretary general about creating a foundation to provide support to one million poor women worldwide.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the Saudi government said it was considering its options, which include an immediate appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, an exceptional step allowed in lawsuits against foreign governments. Usually, pretrial rulings may not be appealed until a trial is over.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, Alexandra A. E. Shapiro, said the Saudi Mission fired Ms. Al Mukaddam ''for legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons,'' but would not elaborate. She said the ruling placed the Saudi government and potentially other foreign governments in a position where they are ''essentially subject to blackmail.''</p>
        <p>The Saudi government, she said, would either have to waive its diplomatic privileges to defend itself in the lawsuit -- for example, allow Saudi officials to testify -- or simply not defend the suit and be forced to pay a judgment ''even where, as in this case, the claims have no merit,'' Ms. Shapiro said.</p>
        <p>She added that the United States could find itself in similar situations abroad; for example, it might have to defend its employment practices at a diplomatic mission in a country with a very different legal system or customs, like one governed by religious law.</p>
        <p>Bobbi C. Sternheim, who represents Ms. Al Mukaddam, said that her client had no comment because the case was pending, but that Ms. Al Mukaddam was ''very pleased'' with the ruling, ''and we are confident that we will prevail at further proceedings.''</p>
        <p>In seeking the suit's dismissal, the Saudi government said Ms. Al Mukaddam was ''a professional civil servant whose duties were to carry out a foreign policy function,'' the judge wrote.</p>
        <p>The Saudis cited the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 and the Vienna Convention, both of which it said gave its mission absolute immunity with regard to hiring and firing decisions.</p>
        <p>The Saudis' view was supported by the United Nations. A United Nations official, defending the immunity argument, wrote to the judge that any measure that might hinder the ability of a mission to function would contravene the United Nations Charter.</p>
        <p>In issuing the decision, which was released Friday, Judge Kaplan did not address the merits of the suit, and accepted the allegations as true for the limited purpose of deciding whether to allow the suit to go forward. Judge Kaplan ruled that Ms. Al Mukaddam fit an exception to diplomatic immunity that applies to commercial activity.</p>
        <p>The judge also noted that she was hired in the United States and was not a Saudi civil servant, and that her work, which included research and clerical tasks and drafting speeches that were delivered by Saudi officials to the United Nations, was not of a diplomatic nature.</p>
