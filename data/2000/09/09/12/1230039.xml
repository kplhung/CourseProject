        <p>Like the others before it, the latest Patrick Ewing trade scenario seems to be dying a slow death.</p>
        <p>Seattle and the Los Angeles Lakers want to complete the trade -- Ewing to Seattle, Horace Grant from Seattle to Los Angeles and Glen Rice from Los Angeles to the Knicks -- but the Knicks will not agree to the deal unless they get a front-line center or power forward in the package.</p>
        <p>Since Seattle is no longer willing to send Vin Baker to the Knicks, neither the Sonics nor the Lakers can meet that need. While the Knicks would perhaps receive Travis Knight, the Lakers' backup center, in the deal, he is not enough to make them part with Ewing.</p>
        <p>Seattle would also send a few marginal players to the other teams in order to meet the requirements of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
        <p>The only ways for the proposed deal to occur is through the involvement of a fourth team that would deliver to the Knicks a legitimate big man or for the Knicks to secure a big man through a second trade.</p>
        <p>This is the second attempt in the last month between the three teams to complete a Ewing deal. The Knicks also discussed trading Ewing to Washington for Juwan Howard, but the gaping hole at center for the Knicks that that deal would have left eventually killed those talks.</p>
        <p>Ewing's willingness to go to Seattle or Washington is evidence of his overwhelming desire to leave New York. While the Knicks are working with his agent, David Falk, in an attempt to grant Ewing's wishes, they will not make a bad trade.</p>
        <p>If they cannot find a deal to their liking, the Knicks will bank on Ewing's professionalism and solid relationship with Coach Jeff Van Gundy to get them through the season without major controversy.</p>
