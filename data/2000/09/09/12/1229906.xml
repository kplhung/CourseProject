        <p>At the Gucci men's show in Milan earlier this summer, Dylan McDermott, the actor who isn't Dermott Mulroney but the one who plays a Boston lawyer on ''The Practice,'' sat in the front row in the kind of attenuated black suit (Gucci, needless to say) his character would only wear if he were delivering a summation to 12 jury members who also happened to be putting together the next Whitney Biennial.</p>
        <p>What came down the runway --  indulgent expressions of a momentary Bruce Lee fascination -- well, there wasn't much there for smug lawyers, either. As it turned out, Mr. McDermott had already found some  clothes for his character to wear this season, and they were from a designer named John Varvatos.</p>

        <p>At the Gucci men's show in Milan earlier this summer, Dylan McDermott, the actor who isn't Dermott Mulroney but the one who plays a Boston lawyer on ''The Practice,'' sat in the front row in the kind of attenuated black suit (Gucci, needless to say) his character would only wear if he were delivering a summation to 12 jury members who also happened to be putting together the next Whitney Biennial.</p>
        <p>What came down the runway --  indulgent expressions of a momentary Bruce Lee fascination -- well, there wasn't much there for smug lawyers, either. As it turned out, Mr. McDermott had already found some  clothes for his character to wear this season, and they were from a designer named John Varvatos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Varvatos, who is showing his second men's collection on Thursday morning in Bryant Park, where much of Fashion Week will be held, is everything a new fashion star generally isn't. First, there is the fact that he designs clothes for men rather than women. Then there's the matter of his age, which is 45, not 26. And surely that is one reason he is so decidedly averse to the zanily effete.</p>
        <p>''Very few men's wear designers understand that regular blokes do not want to look like hairdressers or skateboarders or street hustlers,'' said Simon Doonan, creative director at Barneys New York. Barneys has given Mr. Varvatos hundreds of square feet in its Madison Avenue store, putting him in a league with the Dolce &amp; Gabannas, and Mr. Doonan is featuring Mr. Varvatos's fall clothes prominently in the store's current advertising campaign. Mr. Varvatos also received a lot of room for a new designer at Bergdorf Goodman and at Saks Fifth Avenue, which were quick to pick him up after a first collection that did not go unnoticed by the press.</p>
        <p>The designer's clothes seem intended for the kind of guy who has moved into a salary bracket that no longer confines him to Banana Republic. Mr. Varvatos, who garnered the award for best new designer of men's wear at the American Fashion Awards in June, creates masculine clothes. There are bulky knit sweaters, wide-leg pants and topcoats -- made in Italy, not Taiwan -- with fabrics Mr. Varvatos develops with his manufacturers. For his spring line, the silhouettes are similar, this time with sweaters made of a cashmere-linen blend.</p>
        <p>A native of suburban Detroit, Mr. Varvatos was the head men's wear designer at both Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein before going out on his own with backing from Nautica. Executives from Nautica in fact called him seven years ago about starting a line, but Mr. Varvatos turned them down. ''I decided my ego wasn't that big,'' he said. Eventually, though, he started to see a real void in the men's market, and when Nautica called him two years ago with the same offer, he said yes. He also oversees Nautica's jeans line.</p>
        <p>''There's the modern guy who shops at Prada and Gucci and Helmut Lang,'' Mr. Varvatos said. ''And then there's the classic Armani customer. But there's a guy in the middle and there isn't that much out there for him.''</p>
        <p>That is a point Mr. Varvatos likes to make as he travels to stores to rouse the sales people. ''Please take the time to go through the collection because you can find great details to talk to the customer about,'' he said to a group at Bergdorf Goodman a few weeks ago as he picked up acoat with a built-in cell phone pocket.</p>
        <p>''I'm a business person as well as a designer,'' Mr. Varvatos said later. ''Sometimes designers are brilliant creatively, but they lose touch with what's happening at the store. You have to ring the register.''</p>
