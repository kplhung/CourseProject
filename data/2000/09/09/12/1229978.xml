        <p>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company has named Alan J. Lacy, a financial trouble-shooter, to succeed Arthur C. Martinez as president and chief executive, effective Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lacy, 46, who climbed the executive ladder after he stanched losses in the company's credit card business, will add the title of chairman when Mr. Martinez, 60, retires in December. Mr. Lacy told analysts yesterday during a conference call that he would build on the core strengths of Sears in retail, after-sale service and credit by ''doing fewer things better.''</p>
        <p>He will take over at a time when Sears hopes to exploit the departure of the Circuit City chain from the home appliance business. Analysts said Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., already had 38 percent of the home appliance market. Appliance sales helped Sears gain 5.6 percent in sales at stores open at least a year in August, a lackluster month for many retailers as clothing sales faltered.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts, who became familiar with Mr. Lacy when he was chief financial officer at Sears in the mid-1990's, praised the company's choice of an insider for the top position. ''He is an excellent, realistic person,'' said Michael Exstein, a retailing analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''He has seen the consequences of overreaching in the credit and service businesses at Sears, and he has been able to right many of those mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Sears ran into trouble by joining the rush to sign up credit card customers who, in many cases, were unable to pay their bills. It has written off losses and tightened its cardholder requirements, Mr. Exstein noted. In the service business, Sears can try to attract former customers of Circuit City while mainly attending to its own appliance customers.</p>
        <p>Richard Church, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said Sears would ''continue to lead with their best punch, the home area.'' The goal is to attract young women and young families to the stores by emphasizing home furnishings, appliances, home electronics, tools and children's clothes. Sears is experimenting with home goods specialty stories that it calls the Great Indoors, but analysts said it was too soon to forecast their prospects.</p>
        <p>Sears is the third big retailer this summer to announce a new chief executive. On May 31, Kmart selected Charles Conaway, who had been president of the CVS drugstore chain. On July 27, J. C. Penney announced the appointment of Allen L. Questrom, chief executive of Barneys New York and former head of Federated Department Stores.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lacy joined the company in 1994 as a senior vice president after holding finance and strategic planning jobs at Philip Morris and its Kraft Foods unit. He was chief financial officer and executive vice president of Sears from 1995 to 1997, then president of the credit unit for two years, before adding responsibility for home services, customer responses and Internet business as president of services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martinez, who has been chairman and chief executive since 1995, announced his retirement plans in March. A former executive at Saks Fifth Avenue, he joined Sears as head of its troubled retail operations in 1992. Investors applauded as he cut costs, discontinued the famous but money-losing Sears catalog, closed 100 stores and eliminated 50,000 jobs. The company now has 860 department stores and 2,100 specialty stores.</p>
        <p>But Sears stock began to slide in mid-1998 as Wal-Mart, Target and other discount stores offered low prices on household goods, and clothing chains like Gap and Ann Taylor captured apparel customers.</p>
        <p>Sears, which has lost almost half its stock value over the last two years, rose 50 cents yesterday, to $35.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
