        <p>Since he started his career nearly 40 years ago, the Brazilian singer Jorge Ben Jor has gone through a few deep stylistic changes.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, before he changed his name and was still known as Jorge Ben, he frenetically strummed the bottom strings of an acoustic guitar through songs celebrating love and samba and street culture. The inward-looking bossa nova purists found him repetitive and harmony-challenged.</p>
        <p>With a wrenching, wailing voice that extended words for bars at a time, his songs had catchy chant-choruses. He sounded like a one-man samba show in high gear, replicating all the carnival-weary raggedness and collective euphoria of a group within one body. In the early 70's he went through an African-inspired funk phase, exemplified by the low-slung rhythms of one of the greatest funk albums ever made, ''Africa Brasil'' (Polygram Brazil).</p>
        <p>But when he slipped into disco rhythms in the late 70's and 80's, it fit him perfectly, and he's still there. At Irving Plaza on Thursday, his first New York concert in nine years, Mr. Ben Jor played with a six-man group, with two horns and two percussionists. He broke up his chugging electric-guitar rhythms into sharp, syncopated patterns close to those of Nile Rodgers of Chic. He fused tunes, or as soon as one stopped he scratched out a rhythm-guitar line to be the meat of the next one. His percussionists played samba-school rhythms around the central driving pulse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ben Jor overhauled much of his catalog from the 60's: songs like ''Pais Tropical'' (''Tropical Country''), ''Mas, Que Nada,'' (''No Way'') and ''Chove Chuva'' (''It Rains Rain''). There was an interlude of pure percussion, with a cross-weave of trap drums and three tamborims, the small tambourines used in Brazilian carnival. Then Mr. Ben Jor played a whistle, as if leading a parade.</p>
        <p>He made his lyrics fluid: he rapped quickly and drew out his syllables slowly. They were durable, infinitely adaptable songs, and the show had a nonstop sunny energy, without pauses for reflection.</p>
