        <p>JOHNNY SANTIAGO, an actor and an owner of Torch, a restaurant on the Lower East Side, has been a wanted man for most of his adult life. His outlaw career began in January 1994, just before his 24th birthday, when he made the mistake of taking a vacation in Italy and returning to Kennedy Airport with a passport bearing his name.</p>
        <p>As he recalls it, he and his luggage were soon surrounded by eight Customs Services officers and two dogs. ''They took me to a detention room,'' he said. ''I kept asking why I was there, and all they'd say was, 'Something's come up.' I asked to make a phone call, and they said no.'' They searched his bags and his shoes. Finally, after an hour and a half, an agent from the Customs Service told him that there was a warrant for his arrest dating from 1990.</p>
        <p>''Now I was really confused,'' Mr. Santiago said. ''What happened in 1990? I was in college then. Did I get drunk one night and do something? I couldn't think of anything except some unpaid parking tickets. Was this part of the Giuliani crackdown? I told them about the tickets, but they said that wasn't it. Finally an agent told me the warrant was for robbery and possession of stolen goods.''</p>
        <p>The good news was that he knew he hadn't committed those crimes. The bad news was that someone from the New York Police Department was coming to the airport to take him to Rikers Island. ''I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ''I sat there thinking, 'What a way to end the vacation.' ''</p>
        <p>But then, as his third hour in detention was beginning, Mr. Santiago got a mysterious reprieve. ''The Customs detective came back and told me the warrant had been rescinded,'' he said. Still confused but in no mood to linger, he went home and forgot about it, until the next overseas trip, later that year, which ended once again with an interrogation at Kennedy.</p>
        <p>This time he was handcuffed. ''I tried telling them the warrant had been rescinded, but it was still there in the computer,'' he said. ''The agent looked it up and said to me, 'Apparently you've been busy lately.' '' There were now additional charges: assault, resisting arrest and jumping bail.</p>
        <p>After questioning him further and taking his fingerprints, the Customs agents finally recognized his true crime: having the same name and birthday as another man who was wanted for crimes in the Bronx. You might think a computer would be capable of distinguishing the two men, especially since they have different birthplaces (Puerto Rico for the Bronx fugitive, Brooklyn for the Manhattan restaurateur).</p>
        <p>BUT the problem seems beyond the scope of modern computer technology; or, more precisely, the bureaucrats who program those computers. While the wanted man apparently wanders free, the other John Santiago has been detained half a dozen times at local airports, most recently in July. ''The Customs Service now has a special file in their computer on me,'' he said, ''but it still takes an hour or two for me to explain everything and get the agents to look up the file.''</p>
        <p>His biggest fear is being stopped outside the airport. ''I'm afraid to take a long car trip,'' he said. ''I've already had some close calls in New York. I was stopped for speeding once, but the cop gave me a warning and didn't run the license through the computer. Another time they ran the computer check and saw the warrant, but I managed to persuade the cop I wasn't the guy.''</p>
        <p>Another close call occurred several years ago, shortly after he got a driver's license with a new address in the Village. ''An N.Y.P.D. detective knocked on the door of my apartment at 11:30 at night,'' Mr. Santiago said. ''He showed me a picture of a guy named John Santiago and a warrant for him listing my address. The computer must have attached it because of my license. I was petrified. I was standing there in my underwear figuring that I'd be arrested if I told him my name. I just said I'd never seen the guy in the picture, and the detective went away.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Santiago tried to clear things up at the source of the warrant, State Supreme Court in the Bronx. ''They ran a fingerprint check on me and gave me a printout saying I wasn't the guy they wanted,'' he said. ''But the document looks like something I could have made up at home. I asked for a letter with a court seal on it, but the judge refused. I said to him, 'Look, if I get pulled over for speeding some Friday afternoon, I could spend a weekend in jail.' His response was, 'Well, you shouldn't be speeding.' ''</p>
