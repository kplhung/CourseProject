        <p>As he stood by his locker at Giants Stadium, quarterback Kerry Collins had every reason to be pleased. He was running the offense with efficiency and dazzle. He had won over the once skeptical defense. The Giants were undefeated.</p>
        <p>But Collins showed little satisfaction today, at least in this public moment. He was leading his team's charge into cautionary mode, though fully aware the Giants were staring at a Chicago Bears team that has done little right during the first two weeks of the season.</p>
        <p>''We can't get full of ourselves and get big heads and think we're pretty good,'' said Collins, whose team will travel to Chicago for the game Sunday. ''Just ask the Eagles.''</p>
        <p>During the preseason, the Eagles were among some candidates being touted as perhaps this season's surprise team in the National Football League. And after soundly beating the Cowboys in Dallas on Sept. 3, the talk only intensified. Comparisons were made with last season's St. Louis Rams, an unheralded team that won the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>But the Giants ended that talk quickly Sunday with a 33-18 victory against Philadelphia, and they pushed their record to 2-0 for the first time under Coach Jim Fassel.</p>
        <p>Collins had a superb day passing -- 21 of 29 passes for 220 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions -- and kept the offense on the field for most of the game, which gave the Giants' defense a breather.</p>
        <p>The defense, which had its own share of critics during the preseason, capitalized on its few opportunities on the field. Jason Sehorn had a solid, all-around game.</p>
        <p>''He was all over the field,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb was constantly pressured, with the Giants defense hitting him 15 times by Fassel's count. The Giants' linebackers produced three sacks. And Duce Staley, the rugged Eagles back who sliced through the Cowboys' defense for 201 yards, was held to 11 yards Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Giants were not short on motivation in preparing for the Eagles. But this week will be tougher, the players and the coaches said today. The Bears are coming off a 41-0 loss at Tampa Bay. They are 0-2 heading into their home opener and looking to turn things around.</p>
        <p>Soon after the Giants' victory over the Eagles on Sunday, Fassel praised his team's focus and said that it surpassed that of any team he has coached previously. The Giants will need that concentration next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mondays are reserved for analyzing film of the previous day's game, so Fassel could not completely turn the page today. And he does not plan to keep the video of the Bears' loss from his players, either. Still, he made sure to tell them, ''It's the last I want to hear about it.''</p>
        <p>Fassel had little opposition in the locker room. True, the Giants' 2-0 record puts them atop the National Football Conference East. But the Giants questioned the caliber of their opposition and noted that neither the Eagles nor the Arizona Cardinals, their two victims, were playoff teams last season.</p>
        <p>And had anyone forgotten the questions raised by an 0-4 preseason? Or the Giants' 7-9 finish last season, which left everyone's status, including Fassel's, in question?</p>
        <p>A change of attitude has definitely taken hold of the Giants in the last two weeks. Some, such as the ever-confident Tiki Barber, already oozed self-assurance. Others are quickly gaining it.</p>
        <p>Fassel said part of the confidence is a result of Collins's leadership. Not only is he playing well, but for the first time since Fassel arrived in 1997 there is no controversy about who the quarterback is.</p>
        <p>''That has a calming effect,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Collins played the leader perfectly today, deflecting praise and inviting realism.</p>
        <p>''Now it's a matter of how we're going to react to success,'' Collins said. ''Are we going to go to Chicago and lay an egg?''</p>
        <p>The Bears seemingly do not pose much of a threat. On Sunday, they managed only 165 yards on offense. Quarterback Cade McNown threw two interceptions, fumbled and was sacked five times. The Bears had fewer third-down conversions (one) than delay-of-game penalties (two).</p>
        <p>''The danger is us feeding into that, saying that they're just going to lay down,''  Giants offensive lineman Lomas Brown said. ''We'll be more dangerous to ourselves than the Bears are. If we go in as a desperate team and a team that's 2-0 but hasn't beaten anybody, then we'll beat those guys.''</p>
        <p>But even Brown was not beyond giving away a little of what the Giants were feeling.</p>
        <p>''Right now,'' he said, ''we're in the driver's seat.''</p>
        <p>So leave it to Keith Hamilton to throw some cold water on the Giants' celebration. The veteran defensive tackle had questioned their quality of play in the victory against the Cardinals and again needed to be persuaded that the Giants had anything to boast about.</p>
        <p>''We have a long way to go,'' Hamilton said. ''We have a lot of improvement to do. We're still not finishing people off on defense the way we need to. The last two weeks, people have scored on us in the closing minutes. Against good teams in a close game, you can't do that. We have room for improvement. The offense has room for improvement. Anybody who thinks we're off to a great start is crazy.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>JIM FASSEL said he expected strong safety SAM GARNES (concussion) and tight end PETE MITCHELL (knee) to play Sunday.</p>
