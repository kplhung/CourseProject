        <p>On the opening day of the 25th Toronto International Film Festival, a sunny and muggy Thursday afternoon, a minor miracle took place. At the corner of Bay and Bloor Streets, by the Varsity Theater, a festival site, a sprinkle of water fell to offer relief from the irritating heat.</p>
        <p>The moisture from a cloudless sky had everyone looking and muttering the same question, ''Where's this coming from?'' It was just the kind of thing you would expect from this festival and this city, a place that's both sophisticated and pleasant, and for those dashing from one theater to the next, the light drizzle was like a a needed splash for a boxer between rounds. (I found out that the water was coming from a construction site, but its origin seemed almost beside the point.)</p>

        <p>On the opening day of the 25th Toronto International Film Festival, a sunny and muggy Thursday afternoon, a minor miracle took place. At the corner of Bay and Bloor Streets, by the Varsity Theater, a festival site, a sprinkle of water fell to offer relief from the irritating heat.</p>
        <p>The moisture from a cloudless sky had everyone looking and muttering the same question, ''Where's this coming from?'' It was just the kind of thing you would expect from this festival and this city, a place that's both sophisticated and pleasant, and for those dashing from one theater to the next, the light drizzle was like a a needed splash for a boxer between rounds. (I found out that the water was coming from a construction site, but its origin seemed almost beside the point.)</p>
        <p>Toronto's festival is among the most cosmopolitan and inclusive because the city turns out to support film. It's a metropolis for movie lovers who take the opportunity to immerse themselves in their enthusiasm. (Toronto has one of the three largest moviegoing populations in North America, along with New York and Los Angeles.)</p>
        <p>The joke has always been that Canadians in general -- and Toronto residents specifically -- have to make up for a lack of cool with a reflexive cordiality that borders on the pathological; this couldn't be less true.</p>
        <p>Many of the more than 300 films at this year's festival dramatize family life in distinctive and idiosyncratic ways. The wry and subtly atmospheric ''Angels of the Universe,'' a film by the Icelandic director Fridrik Thor Fridriksson, looks with sumptuous intensity at obsession, loss and spirituality through the eyes of its suffering and game protagonist. ''We're all equal before God, angels of the universe,'' he says, though it's hard to believe when you see him and several other men with Messiah complexes puffing nervously on cigarettes. This anxiety keeps the movie vibrating. Equally sumptuous is Mr. Fridriksson's use of music; it's a big part of his hero's life, as the star pounds the walls of his house to ''I Put a Spell on You,'' and the luscious colors shine while the lovely, weightless songs of the Icelandic pop group Sigur Ros play. Some may find the miraculous essence of ''Angels'' too literal, but Mr. Fridriksson has manufactured a gorgeous fugue state.</p>
        <p>Paul Cox's ''Innocence'' is about a body blow to family. Its two elderly lovers pick up after a gap of 50 years, and reveries of their earlier involvement intrude into their current lives. The picture's a little square, but the performances by its leads, who come to life slowly -- as they spend more time together, and old feelings and insecurities re-emerge -- move the picture beyond a safe timorousness. The two actresses playing the older and younger Claire have the same pained lines around their mouths.</p>
        <p>Even director Benoit Jacquot's ''Sade,'' a melodrama about the Marquis de Sade (Daniel Auteuil), has the roving sensualist acting as a father figure. It's the most unusual performance that the generally laid-back Mr. Auteuil has ever given. Savoring every syllable as each rolls off his lips, he incorporates a theatrical and outsize audacity, like a French Jack Nicholson.</p>
        <p>His daring and gentleness is responsible for one of the best scenes of any movie in the festival: a group, including the luminous young actress Islid Le Besco, has gone through a mild debauchery tutorial by Sade, and while they can't hold their heads up to look anyone in the eyes, Sade ravenously devours a peach; another day, another virgin.</p>
        <p>The director Stephen Frears was honored by the festival for his body of work. His remarkable and intimate new film, ''Liam,'' is playing here in addition to other films by him. Though his work seems to be about ad hoc families, he rolls his eyes when that point is raised.</p>
        <p>''I don't think about these things that much,'' Mr. Frears said. ''The whole business of giving so much attention to directors is rubbish. I know the contributions that others make. When I was a boy I just went to the pictures. I didn't question things. Though I have been the beneficiary of a questioning generation, that's very true. I'm just sick of it.''</p>
        <p>''Liam'' is about family and tragedy in Liverpool in 1930; its 7-year-old title character is played by Anthony Burrows. A family struggles to make ends meet as Fascism begins to ripen in England, though it's also a comedy about repression, a subject that resonates through most of Frears's work.</p>
        <p>''Oh, all right,'' he said with a laugh. ''This one is about family. It's about a child's view of the world, and the cruel way the father is treated, a man who's trying to maintain his dignity. If you're treated like that by the world, then Fascism makes sense. I feel sorry for him. I admire the mother, who keeps things going in the house. I've always admired actresses in my films because they're stoic and dignified, like the mother in 'Liam' or Michelle Pfeiffer in 'Dangerous Liaisons.' Actors are always the ones who complain, about their lines or their makeup.''</p>
        <p>Fascism leads to racism in the horrifying climax of ''Liam,'' and it's like the best of Frears's work: an apparent calm is disrupted by characters coming to grips with the misery they're capable of causing.</p>
        <p>Encountering that evil in Hanif Kureishi's script for ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' saddened him, Mr. Frears said.</p>
        <p>''Racism first appeared publicly in England in 1957, during the race riots,'' he said. ''Otherwise it's very quiet and insidious. When I read Hanif's script, my heart sank. There's so much denial, there. But, yes, 'Liam' is about denial, too. I first learned I was Jewish when I was 20, when my mother told me. It was startling, but it was much more startling to have something concealed from me for so long.</p>
        <p>''You could say it made a sort of dollar-book-Freud sense of my life. But it's funny about 'Liam.' In the scene when the kids come running out of the cinema after seeing the movie, they're playing cowboys and Indians. And they didn't know how, so we had to teach them to be racist.''</p>
