        <p>Oprah Winfrey knew that it might be a rough day at the office. Before introducing Vice President Al Gore to her audience today, television's high priestess of self-revelation told her fans that she had always ''stayed away from politicians'' as guests because she never felt she could have an honest conversation with them. ''After 15 years,'' she said, ''I thought, O.K., I need to try to penetrate that wall.''</p>
        <p>But after an hour with Mr. Gore seated beside her in a yellow leather armchair, Ms. Winfrey had done little more than chip away at the mortar. In the interview, which was broadcast from Ms. Winfrey's studio in Chicago, Mr. Gore revealed little that was new, though viewers did learn that his favorite book is ''The Red and the Black'' by 19th century French novelist Robert Stendahl; that his favorite movie is the quirky 1983 Scottish film ''Local Hero,'' and that his favorite cereal is Wheaties.</p>

        <p>Oprah Winfrey knew that it might be a rough day at the office. Before introducing Vice President Al Gore to her audience today, television's high priestess of self-revelation told her fans that she had always ''stayed away from politicians'' as guests because she never felt she could have an honest conversation with them. ''After 15 years,'' she said, ''I thought, O.K., I need to try to penetrate that wall.''</p>
        <p>But after an hour with Mr. Gore seated beside her in a yellow leather armchair, Ms. Winfrey had done little more than chip away at the mortar. In the interview, which was broadcast from Ms. Winfrey's studio in Chicago, Mr. Gore revealed little that was new, though viewers did learn that his favorite book is ''The Red and the Black'' by 19th century French novelist Robert Stendahl; that his favorite movie is the quirky 1983 Scottish film ''Local Hero,'' and that his favorite cereal is Wheaties.</p>
        <p>And yet, Mr. Gore may have achieved much of what he wished. On a show with 22 million viewers a week, three-fourths of them women, the Democratic presidential nominee portrayed himself as a sensitive and devoted family man.</p>
        <p>His favorite indulgence, he said, is water-skiing with his family on a Tennessee lake. If the demands of the presidency became toxic for his family life, he said he would simply ''change the nature of the job.'' When Ms. Winfrey asked him how he responded when he first learned that his wife, Tipper, suffered from depression, he said, ''To feel the love and search for the healing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Winfrey also asked Mr. Gore about the sloppy kiss he planted on his wife at the Democratic Convention, and twice showed videotape of the prolonged smooch. Mr. Gore then explained that ''this is a partnership and she is my soulmate,'' a choice of words that elicited appreciative applause from the largely female audience. Ms. Winfrey then pitched in by showing a short film illustrating the firmness of the Gores' marriage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore appeared at ease with Ms. Winfrey, who will interview his Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, on Sept. 19. But for most of the show, Mr. Gore stuck closely to his campaign script. When Ms. Winfrey asked him why she should vote for him, he responded,  ''I'm for the people, not the powerful.'' When she relayed a question from an online viewer about the greatest problem facing the country, he replied that ''we need more meaning in our national life.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps his least scripted responses came after the cameras blinked off, when Mr. Gore lingered in the studio for about 20 minutes to take more questions from Ms. Winfrey and the audience. When a woman asked about Mr. Bush's ''problems'' with alcohol, Mr. Gore said he did not make any judgments about his opponent, that he took Mr. Bush at his word that ''he's had a personal transformation and a period of growth.'' Mr. Bush, 54, has said he drank more than he should have until he swore off alcohol 14 years ago.</p>
        <p>Ms. Winfrey also asked Mr. Gore after the taping whether there were things he could say now about President Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky that he could not say at the time. ''Did you and Tipper talk about it over dinner and say, 'Can you believe?' '' she asked. ''I'm not giving you any exact quotes,'' Mr. Gore said. ''You're in the ballpark.''</p>
        <p>In the broadcast, Ms. Winfrey had fun playing a game of ''favorite things'' with Mr. Gore. Favorite subject in school, she asked. ''Hmmm, science,'' he responded. Favorite teacher: ''Dean Stambaugh, who was my art teacher.'' Favorite quote: ''Hmm, ah, Bob Dylan: those who are not busy being born are busy dying.'' Favorite time of year: ''Springtime.'' Favorite thing to sleep in: ''A bed.'' All-time favorite musical group: ''Beatles.'' Favorite meal: ''Chinese.'' Favorite childhood memory: ''Playing baseball with my dad.''</p>
        <p>From Chicago, Mr. Gore flew to Belleville, Ill., for a meeting on education at Westhaven Elementary School. There, he repeated his ultimatum, first issued on Sunday, that the entertainment industry stop marketing violent films, recordings and video games to children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush today told reporters that Mr. Gore was ''short of credibility on the issue'' because the Democrats have received more than $13 million in contributions from the entertainment industry. The Republicans have received nearly $9 million from the same source. Mr. Bush said that as president he would ''absolutely talk with C.E.O.'s in Hollywood, those who produce the products that oftentimes pollute our children's mind.''</p>
        <p>Also at the school forum, Mr. Gore was asked by a woman about what he could do as president to bring prayer back to the classroom.</p>
        <p>After joking that there would always be prayer in schools as long as there are arithmetic tests, Mr. Gore said that ''in some school settings the impression is given that it's wrong if a student wants to exercise or display his or her faith or engage in a truly voluntary prayer that the school employees have nothing to do with.''</p>
        <p>Supreme Court prohibitions against organized school prayer, he said, have sometimes been ''taken to an extreme that actually discriminates against some people of faith who wish to bring faith into their school life.''</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT  Correction:  September 13, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about Oprah Winfrey's interview with Al Gore used a misspelled pen name and a nonexistent given name for the author of ''The Red and the Black,'' which Mr. Gore described as his favorite book. The pen name is Stendhal, not Stendahl; Robert is not part of it.</p>
