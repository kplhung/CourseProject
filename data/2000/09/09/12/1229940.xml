        <p>In his first public appearance since the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires in the United States, the president of Firestone's Japanese parent acknowledged today that the company had not paid proper attention to quality control.</p>
        <p>The president of Bridgestone, Yo ichiro Kaizaki, said the company would exert stronger control over the management of its American subsidiary, Bridgestone/Firestone, and that it would apply the same quality-control criteria for both its Bridgestone and Firestone tires.</p>

        <p>In his first public appearance since the recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires in the United States, the president of Firestone's Japanese parent acknowledged today that the company had not paid proper attention to quality control.</p>
        <p>The president of Bridgestone, Yo ichiro Kaizaki, said the company would exert stronger control over the management of its American subsidiary, Bridgestone/Firestone, and that it would apply the same quality-control criteria for both its Bridgestone and Firestone tires.</p>
        <p>''The way we have managed it was wrong,'' Mr. Kaizaki said. There had been dual standards within the company regarding problems with the two brands, he said. ''The responsibility for the problem lies with Tokyo,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The acknowledgment was unusual for a company that has been criticized for not having its top executives actively address the tire problems. In another sign of a new public tack, Bridgestone/Firestone said that it had named Ketchum, a unit of the Omnicom Group, as its new public relations firm, after Fleishman-Hillard International Communications resigned earlier this month.</p>
        <p>''We know that we have been slow in responding to public concerns, that we underestimated the intensity of the situation, and that we have been too focused on internal details,'' Masatoshi Ono, the chief executive of the American subsidiary, said in a statement announcing the hiring. ''We are determined to change all that.''</p>
        <p>His boss, Mr. Kaizaki, said earlier at a news conference in Tokyo that Bridgestone/Firestone was managed independently of the parent. ''We managed subsidiaries located in Japan quite carefully but have not applied the same attention to managing overseas subsidiaries,'' Mr. Kaizaki said. '''We let the U.S. unit use its own culture. There was an element of mistake in that.''</p>
        <p>Dual standards also existed when it came to technology support, he said.</p>
        <p>''If there was a problem with a Bridgestone tire, our technology staff in Tokyo would rush to the site'' overseas to help out, Mr. Kaizaki said. ''But if a problem arose with a Firestone tire, they wouldn't do anything.''</p>
        <p>Still, he said, the company has not identified specific defects in the tires. He said there were variables that could have contributed to the accidents, including air pressure and length of use. He added that the number of accidents in other vehicles using Firestone tires was lower than those involving Ford Explorers. The accidents ''for some reason'' keep happening, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaizaki, who was president of the United States subsidiary in the early 1990's, said Bridgestone would do its ''utmost to keep the Firestone brand.''</p>
        <p>He said that he had no plans to resign. Shares of Bridgestone have plunged 46.6 percent since the Aug. 9 recall announcement. In Tokyo trading, Bridgestone slipped 2 yen, to 1,108 yen ($10.45).</p>
        <p>''I am fully aware that we suffered a critical damage,'' Mr. Kaizaki said.</p>
