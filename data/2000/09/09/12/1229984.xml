        <p>In threatening to aim punitive legislation at the entertainment industry, Vice President Al Gore has crossed a line that no Democratic presidential candidate should ever cross. His party has a tradition of protecting free expression. Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, betray that tradition by advocating what would amount to government censorship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's statements came as the Federal Trade Commission produced a report requested by President Clinton after the ghastly shooting at Columbine High School. In it, the commission charges that the producers of movies, music and computer and video games have marketed inappropriate material to young people, violating the spirit of their own ratings system. The F.T.C. recommended tightening enforcement of ratings curbs, a step that the industry should consider as a matter of civic responsibility and political prudence.</p>

        <p>In threatening to aim punitive legislation at the entertainment industry, Vice President Al Gore has crossed a line that no Democratic presidential candidate should ever cross. His party has a tradition of protecting free expression. Mr. Gore and his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, betray that tradition by advocating what would amount to government censorship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's statements came as the Federal Trade Commission produced a report requested by President Clinton after the ghastly shooting at Columbine High School. In it, the commission charges that the producers of movies, music and computer and video games have marketed inappropriate material to young people, violating the spirit of their own ratings system. The F.T.C. recommended tightening enforcement of ratings curbs, a step that the industry should consider as a matter of civic responsibility and political prudence.</p>
        <p>But in delivering the report, the Trade Commission chairman, Robert Pitofsky, cautioned against setting up a federal ''thought police.'' Mr. Gore tried to skirt that problem by saying he would back legislation to give the F.T.C. broader power to punish the entertainment industry for ''deceptive advertising,'' but that he would do so in a way ''consistent with the First Amendment.'' That is sophistry that seems to reinforce the charge by the Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, that Mr. Gore will say anything to get elected.</p>
        <p>A presidential candidate can properly promise to jawbone Hollywood into responsible behavior on this serious national problem. But to seek the votes of cultural conservatives by advocating new legal restrictions on commercial speech is a dangerous assault on civil liberties and the Constitution.</p>
        <p>Moreover, as the F.T.C. noted in its report,  there is no concrete evidence linking violent or sexual content in popular culture with the violent actions of teenagers with guns. That does not mean that the industry can refuse to help parents exercise control over what their children watch. But that must be done through voluntary labeling and a rigorously enforced rating system. The Gore-Lieberman approach glosses over the fact that R-rated movies are not barred to teenagers. The rating requires that those under 17 be accompanied by an adult. Barring the marketing of R movies on television shows that have a large teenage audience would violate the rights of other viewers of these shows who are 18 and older.</p>
        <p>These difficulties make it all the more dangerous to wield a legislative or regulatory cudgel. The proper place for enforcing the rating ban against unaccompanied teenagers going to R-rated movies is at the movie theater. An unwarranted expansion of federal regulatory power over advertising content is not the solution.</p>
