        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Why the Best Don't Teach,'' by Harold O. Levy (Op-Ed, Sept. 9):</p>
        <p>Most would-be teachers are not only scared off by the low salaries but also by the paperwork and meetings that draw their energies away from their students. The goal of a teacher is not to make gobs of money, but rather to educate and inspire the next generation. The more they are allowed to do that as opposed to doing district-imposed busywork, the more likely they are to be satisfied with their career choice.</p>
        <p>These days, private-sector companies that are competing for workers try to entice the best applicants with more than just salary. The intangibles like work environment, appreciation and support balanced with freedom are a big part of a person's decision. Let teachers do what they are good at, and don't force them to be part of a stifling bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL ZERELLA  Phoenix, Sept. 9, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a teacher at a charter high school.</p>
