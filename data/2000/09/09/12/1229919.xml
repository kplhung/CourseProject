        <p>Until this season, Siri Mullinix had played exactly one game at goalkeeper for the American women's soccer team.

        <p>Until this season, Siri Mullinix had played exactly one game at goalkeeper for the American women's soccer team. She was among the final cuts from the 1999 World Cup squad, knowing that, at age 22, she would have to wait her turn. Goalkeepers, like plumbers and electricians, require extensive apprenticeships.</p>
        <p>''It was tough, but I knew my time would come,'' Mullinix said. ''I never expected it to come this quick.''</p>
        <p>When the United States begins its Olympic title defense against Norway on Thursday in Melbourne, its lineup is likely to feature three significant changes that run like a zippered seam through the defense. Midfielder Michelle Akers has retired, defender Carla Overbeck is recovering from knee surgery and Briana Scurry has lost her job in goal after problems with fitness and shin splints.</p>
        <p>With Akers, Overbeck and Scurry anchoring the defense, the Americans did not surrender a single goal in the second half of any match in the 1999 Women's World Cup. Akers is widely considered the greatest player in women's soccer history. Overbeck is the American captain, a fierce, confident, calming leader. Scurry made a flurry of brilliant stops against Brazil in the World Cup semifinals, then made a decisive save during penalty kicks in the final.</p>
        <p>Their replacements -- Mullinix in goal, Christie Pearce on defense and Lorrie Fair in defensive midfield -- are capable players, but they lack the experience and presence of the other longtime starters. And there is no time for the Americans to ease into the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Norway is the only team with a winning record (14-12-2) against the Americans, and China, which the United States plays in its second match, finished as the runner-up in the 1999 World Cup. Two defeats and the Americans would be out of the Olympics two days after the opening ceremonies. In eight matches against Norway and China this year, the United States is 2-4-2.</p>
        <p>The encouraging news is that the Americans have played without Akers, Overbeck and Scurry for nearly every game since the World Cup. Mullinix has recorded 13 shutouts this year, an American record. She roams the penalty area like a center fielder, pushing as much as 25 yards upfield, preventing buildups from getting dangerous or spectacular, allowing her teammates to pressure the ball in the opponent's half of the field.</p>
        <p>''She's pretty much like a field player who can use her hands,'' said Kate Sobrero, an American defender.</p>
        <p>The danger, of course, is that Norway prefers the long ball and could chip a shot over Mullinix's head. She has also never played in a tournament this important. But she has something that many young players lack when they come into the national team: confidence and assertiveness. The winner of two national championships at the University of North Carolina, her record in the starting lineup of the national team is 14-3-3, including an assured performance in a 1-0 victory over Norway last March in a tournament in Portugal.</p>
        <p>''I finally got to the point where I felt good in such a competitive environment, and then it was a matter of doing it consistently with my play,'' Mullinix said. ''I think I have.''</p>
        <p>Only once have the United States women played most of a major tournament without Akers, and it was the one tournament they did not win. She was knocked unconscious seven minutes into the 1995 World Cup, and did not return until the semifinals, when the tired, uncertain Americans lost to Norway.</p>
        <p>Akers was always fiercely reliable. She was the most insistent taker of penalty kicks for the Americans and, at 5 feet 10 inches, 150 pounds, she dominated the midfield in a way that no one else could in the women's game. China was clearly intimidated by her in the final of the 1999 World Cup. But a recurring shoulder injury and a decade of battling chronic fatigue syndrome left Akers unable to play at the top international level anymore.</p>
        <p>No one player can replace her, Heinrichs said. It will have to be a group effort. Mullinix must be reliable in goal, Fair must pressure the ball all over the field, Mia Hamm must be continuously assertive, Julie Foudy must be rangy, Kristine Lilly must have a tackling presence and get forward for shots, Tiffeny Milbrett must shoot efficiently, Cindy Parlow must control balls with her head and provide some of the intimidating presence that Akers did.</p>
        <p>''We've never not had Michelle in a major tournament,'' Milbrett said. ''I'm still a little curious with that.''</p>
        <p>The Olympics is likely to be the last major tournament for many of the pioneering players on the American team. The team sometimes appeared tired as it played 33 games this year in six countries. Questions about fatigue linger. Heinrichs, however, has tapered recent workouts, and, according to Sobrero, the players have recovered their legs and their determination.</p>
        <p>There is a new formation, with four defenders, four midfielders and two forwards, as opposed to three forwards and three midfielders in the World Cup. Shannon MacMillan is now a starter in midfield instead of the first reserve off the bench. Overbeck should be available for 20 or 30 minutes a game. The one final bit of motivation for this team is to win a major tournament on the road after winning the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and the 1999 World Cup at home.</p>
        <p>''Our detractors say, 'They can only win at home,' '' Sobrero said. ''This is our chance to prove we're the best and we can win anywhere.''</p>
