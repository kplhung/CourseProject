        <p>Many parents might be surprised to learn that most of the drugs prescribed for children, from allergy relievers to asthma inhalants and antidepressants, have never been formally tested on children. Starting this December, however, a new Food and Drug Administration rule mandates that any new adult drug that could be used by children with the same disease must undergo pediatric study, and its manufacturers must list doses for children on the label. In addition, if an adult drug already on the market has the potential to help children with the same disease, or if it is widely used in children and the absence of labeling seems dangerous, the F.D.A. can require pediatric tests.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A. was, in part, shaped in response to high-profile problems involving children, including the severe birth defects caused by thalidomide, a sedative given to pregnant women in the late 1950's. But Dr. Dianne Murphy, associate director of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, says that for a host of ethical, scientific and economic reasons, the agency has not mandated drug research on children, until now.</p>
        <p>The new requirement comes three years after Congress, in an effort to encourage such research, offered a lucrative financial incentive to drug manufacturers, giving them a six-month patent and marketing extension on drugs they agree to test in children at the F.D.A.'s request.</p>
        <p>With such prodding, more than 275 clinical trials involving nearly 20,000 children are completed, in progress or about to begin. Advertisements soliciting children's participation in the trials are appearing in newspapers, on public transportation and on the Internet. Already, the new research has led to expanded labels with clear pediatric dosage instructions for 11 drugs widely prescribed for children, from painkillers to treatments for allergies and H.I.V.</p>
        <p>The Times spoke with Dr. Murphy, 55, a pediatrician with 25 years' experience who is leading efforts to get medications tested on children.</p>
        <p>Q.: At the moment, it seems pediatricians and parents must play a guessing game with most medications. Is that true?</p>
        <p>A.: When you go to treat your kid's fever, you want to know that you're going to make them feel better. Or that you're giving them the right dose to treat their infection. But up to 81 percent of all products used on children have not been studied or labeled for infants and children. We're treating our children without studying the medicine to the degree that we require these drugs to be studied and understood in adults.</p>
        <p>Q.: How is it that the F.D.A. has regulated drugs for adults and not for children?</p>
        <p>A.: The laws to mandate that we study drugs often were based on terrible accidents with children. And yet children have not been studied because people wanted to protect them from experimentation. Ironically, that has led to a decades-long experimentation on our children.</p>
        <p>Q.: Right, by panicked parents like me. Last night, my son was up with a fever, and we couldn't figure out how much pain reliever to give him, because he's under 24 pounds and less than 2 years old. The label just said  ''consult your doctor.'' But we couldn't call that late. So we winged it -- and then we lay awake, wondering: What did we do to our kid?</p>
        <p>A.: Exactly. Why should children have to suffer more than adults because we don't give them the appropriate dose? Drugs like ibuprofen have only been labeled starting at the age of 2. Fortunately, the F.D.A.'s new regulations have already resulted in very large safety studies on fever and pain medications for kids, establishing safe dosages for children down to 6 months of age. [Because the new labels have just been approved, they may not yet be on drugs for sale.] But that's what's so ironic about the labels telling you to ask your doctor. Your doctors often don't have any more information than you do. As an infectious-disease doctor, I've called drug companies and asked: In your research, did you look at children? Do you have any information? Because there is nothing on the label.</p>
        <p>Q.: So, faced with a sick child, do pediatricians withhold the medicine -- or just guess at the dose?</p>
        <p>A.: We give the children the medicine, because as a physician it's your job to provide the best care you can. It would not be proper to deny children a medicine because it hasn't been completely studied, if you know that it works in adults and some of the safety issues have been defined. The problem is, when you get to figuring out the dose, are children going to react differently from adults?</p>
        <p>Q.: How do doctors go about figuring out a dose without adequate information?</p>
        <p>A.: Of course they'd check the Physicians' Desk Reference to see if there was any additional information. Three-quarters of the time, there isn't. But all pediatricians carry around a little handbook, called the Johns Hopkins Harriet Lane Handbook, which is small enough to fit in the pocket of your lab coat. You get it when you're a resident and you hang on to it for the rest of your life. It contains all the information about dosages that the pediatric community has collected, based on experience or studies that were done in a limited way.</p>
        <p>I'll tell you what I do on the phone with parents in the middle of the night: I look it up in my Harriet Lane and calculate by weight. But parents can't always remember what their children weigh. And then there's the parents who don't call. They are guessing, and that clearly isn't the way to take care of kids.</p>
        <p>Q.: I've heard that weight isn't always the best way to measure doses in children.</p>
        <p>A.: That's true. You need to know the right dose for each age group's metabolic state. At some ages, because of the differences in enzyme maturation and total body water, kids actually need a higher dose. With some of the anticonvulsants and drugs for treating asthma and cancer, kids can tolerate higher doses and actually need higher doses to get the same blood level you'd get in an adult with a lower dose.</p>
        <p>Infants, on the other hand, don't metabolize medicine as well because their liver and kidneys are immature in the first months of life. If you go simply by weight, they're going to end up with levels of the medicine in their bloodstream that are too high and can be toxic.</p>
        <p>Q.: Why has it taken this long to get these studies done?</p>
        <p>A.: Actually, the agency had been on this bandwagon since the 1970's, trying to get products studied in children. But it became clear that, unless something dramatic happened, all of the pleading wasn't going to change [the situation]. We were asking drug companies to tell us what they were doing about pediatric drug development. But those regulations had no teeth; it was a strictly voluntary thing.</p>
        <p>And there were ethical issues as well. Most everybody would agree that, in general, you don't want to be putting a brand-new molecular entity into a kid before it's tested first in older adults. But there's a difference between saying we need information before we give it to kids and never getting any information.</p>
        <p>H.I.V. brought this into glaring focus. For years, the drug AZT was available for adults with H.I.V., but not for kids. Children were dying, and we couldn't use AZT to treat them because it hadn't been studied in children.</p>
        <p>Those studies finally took place, but it took years for the drug to be available to kids as a regular prescription drug. Today, because of that experience, in the H.I.V. area we almost always get studies done on children early in the drug development process.</p>
        <p>Q.: I've heard that, until recently, emergency room doctors who wanted to use the sedative Versed on kids had to rely on animal data from beagles.</p>
        <p>A.: Versed is a drug that's very commonly used to sedate people before operations. Under our new regulations, for the first time the [manufacturer of Versed] studied its effect on children, particularly children with heart disease. And they found that if a child with pulmonary hypertension was given the same dose, he would be more likely to have breathing problems. They also found out that you may need different dosing in obese children. If you did it on a weight basis, you might overdose the child.</p>
        <p>So, yes, there are life-and-death issues here. But the most common problem is: Parents want to know that if their kids aren't getting better, it's because the disease is getting worse -- not because they're giving their kid the wrong dose.</p>
        <p>Q.: What drugs can parents safely assume have been tested?</p>
        <p>A.: Most of the antibiotics, all the vaccines and most of the fever suppressants. And a number of the seizure medicines have been studied down into younger age groups. Most of the psychotropic drugs have not been studied in children.</p>
        <p>Q.: Why is studying children so much more problematic than studying adults?</p>
        <p>A.: First, you have to believe that it's ethical to enroll children in clinical trials. The Academy of Pediatrics and other groups have said it is ethical because, otherwise, you're denying kids drugs that could help them. But it takes time to get consent. You give an adult a consent form and ask them if they understand it. With a child you have to explain it not just to the mother and father, but sometimes to the grandmother. And then you have to make sure that the child understands it.</p>
        <p>Q.: How can you safely assume that a child, even a very sick one, understands the risks involved enough to say that he consents to being part of a clinical trial?</p>
        <p>A.: The Academy of Pediatrics suggests that about the age of 7, children cognitively begin to understand risk. Somewhere around 7, the kid can begin to understand what you tell them. But that process is very time-consuming and very difficult and has to be done by people who know how to put it in language that kids can understand.</p>
        <p>Secondly, you have to know how to do clinical trials in children. A kid isn't going to sit there and hold their arm out and say, ''Oh, yeah, go ahead, just take my blood.''  You've got to create a situation where children don't feel threatened, and where they understand what's going on. You need one nurse to talk to the child while the other one is drawing the blood. And you've got to somehow turn it into a game.</p>
        <p>Then there's the technology issue. Ordinarily, with an adult, you'd draw a blood sample at several one-hour intervals. But you can't take large volumes of blood from a kid over a short period, unless you want to make them hypotensive. So we had to wait for the technology to get accurate results from small volumes of blood to monitor a drug's effect on the liver, kidneys and white cells. Hospitals for children have had that technology for a couple of decades now. But until now, not everybody had that.</p>
        <p>Also, we are only now starting to pin down, on the molecular, receptor level and developmentally, how kids are different from adults. And that whole field is in its early childhood.</p>
        <p>Q.: So this big, black hole of information is not simply the fault of pharmaceutical firms that don't want to shoulder the costs of these studies?</p>
        <p>A.: I wouldn't say there's no economics here -- these trials are difficult and expensive. Not many people were interested in doing pediatric studies until Congress offered drug companies a [financial incentive].  Since then, the interest in studying products in children has increased dramatically.</p>
        <p>Q.: Are these clinical trials going to test drugs on sick kids only? Or are healthy kids going to be included as well?</p>
        <p>A.: The F.D.A. has decided that kids in clinical trials have to, potentially at least, receive a direct benefit. In cancer trials, that's a very well-practiced approach. You would never put a cancer drug into a person who didn't have cancer. In general, the kid should have the disease that's being studied. But we've been willing to interpret those words, ''derive benefit,'' widely. So, let's say you wanted to find out if an antibiotic to treat ear infections tasted good or bad. If the kid has had ear infections, he or she doesn't have to have the ear infection at the time of the study. Although some people say they should do taste studies in sick kids, because their taste may be different.</p>
        <p>Q.: Speaking of catering to kids' sense of taste, I've heard that some researchers have offered Toys ''R'' Us gift certificates to children for participating in clinical trials. Are you comfortable with that?</p>
        <p>A.: I know that trials have been conducted in which children and parents have been offered gift certificates. In some situations, it was felt it was better to give parents a coupon to Wal-Mart, for example, plus a taxicab voucher, rather than trying to write them individual checks for their travel expenses. Where you can demonstrate it's simply a way of reimbursing the costs of participating, that only seems fair. Why should it cost you to participate?</p>
