        <p>Seth Abraham, who helped officiate at the profitable marriage of boxing and cable television during two decades at Time Warner and its subsidiary Home Box Office, has been named executive vice president and chief operating officer of Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>According to a news release issued by Madison Square Garden, Mr. Abraham will be responsible for Radio City Entertainment, MSG Sports Properties, MSG Networks and corporate marketing.</p>
        <p>He will report to Madison Square Garden's president and chief executive, David W. Checketts.</p>
        <p>Competition for sporting events and other entertainment programming remains intense, as more channels seek out blockbuster events, like title fights or concerts like the country music singer Garth Brooks's appearance in Central Park last year, to win a greater share of the fragmenting television audience.</p>
