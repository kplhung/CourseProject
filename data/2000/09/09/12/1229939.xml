        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that it was a mistake for Representative Rick A. Lazio to have enthusiastically shaken the hand of Yasir Arafat during a visit to the Middle East nearly two years ago.</p>
        <p>''I'm a little confounded by it,'' Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference in Harlem, adding, ''I don't particularly like to shake hands with murderers.'' But the mayor also said that Mr. Lazio's handshake was ''not a big deal'' and that maybe he ''doesn't have the background and understanding of Arafat that I do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's remarks about his fellow Republican, who replaced him in the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, were not well received by the Lazio campaign. ''The mayor is perfectly welcome to have his opinions,'' said Dan McLagan, its chief spokesman. He said the handshake ''was appropriate at the time.''</p>
        <p>The mayor was responding to questions about a picture released by the White House during the weekend showing Mr. Lazio happily grabbing the hand of Mr. Arafat in a reception line. Clinton administration officials said they released the official White House photograph because Mr. Lazio had criticized President Clinton last week for shaking hands with Fidel Castro during the United Nations Millennium Summit. Mr. Lazio had also criticized Mrs. Clinton for kissing Mr. Arafat's wife, Suha, during a visit to the West Bank last year. Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani repeated his own criticism of the kiss.</p>
        <p>The mayor's comments were consistent with his longtime view of Mr. Arafat. In 1995, Mr. Giuliani expelled Mr. Arafat from a concert for world leaders at Lincoln Center. The mayor said his distrust went back to his days as a federal prosecutor, when he investigated several terrorist incidents linked to the P.L.O. Yesterday he likened the Palestinian leader to Hitler and Stalin. ''You cannot forget that this man is a dictator and that he's a murderer and that he's murdered Americans,'' he said.</p>
