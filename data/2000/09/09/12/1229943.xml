        <p>Gov. George W.

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush told older residents in Florida today that his plans for changing Medicare and providing prescription drug benefits would give them control over their health care, while Vice President Al Gore would give them only ''a government-run'' health maintenance organization.</p>
        <p>''Seems like to me we need to trust seniors to be able to tailor a plan to meet each person's needs,'' Mr. Bush said during a town hall-style meeting at a large retirement complex early this afternoon in Clearwater, near Tampa. ''The federal government ought to be humble enough to allow you to make choices.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's visit here today was intended to help sell the proposal he unveiled last week to coax Medicare recipients to select from a variety of government-subsidized private health insurance plans that include prescription drug benefits.</p>
        <p>But it also underscored the potency of the threat that Mr. Bush is suddenly facing from Mr. Gore. Although aides to Mr. Bush once talked about Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor, as an almost certain win, recent polls classify the state as a toss-up, and Mr. Bush was scheduled to spend part of Tuesday and part of next week here as well.</p>
        <p>''I plan quite a few visits here,'' Mr. Bush said at the St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport, where he arrived from Austin, Tex. His brother greeted him at the airport and later introduced him at the retirement complex, a campaign stop that reflected the disproportionate number -- and influence -- of older voters in Florida.</p>
        <p>In his talk at the retirement center, Mr. Bush offered a broadly drawn portrait of Mr. Gore's plans for prescription drug coverage. ''My opponent's point of view,'' he added, was to create ''only one government-run H.M.O. You'll be thrown into it. That's where you're going to end up -- in a government-run H.M.O.''</p>
        <p>With his description of a big, scary, arrogant federal government, Mr. Bush sought to distill his policy differences with Mr. Gore, who has called for strengthening Medicare and adding prescription drug coverage within the entitlement program.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush was also providing a hint of how he might -- and might not -- incorporate the copious and often unsolicited advice that his campaign has been receiving from Republican strategists and other political analysts ever since Mr. Gore emphatically erased Mr. Bush's lead in polls.</p>
        <p>Many of those experts maintain that Mr. Bush should float above the details of issues like health care on which Democrats in general and Mr. Gore in particular seem to enjoy more voter confidence.</p>
        <p>To some extent, Mr. Bush heeded that counsel, using health care as a prism through which he wanted voters to see the disagreements between him and Mr. Gore on the role of the federal government. Mr. Bush essentially cast himself as the genuine populist.</p>
        <p>''We shouldn't have this concept that the federal government is all  wise and all knowing,'' he said. He also said that his Medicare plan could actually be enacted, an allusion to failed health-care initiatives during the Clinton administration and an assertion that he could be more effective in office than Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush also waded into the brambles of the issue itself, telling his audience that under Mr. Gore's plan, they would have to make binding decisions about their coverage before they turned 65 and would, in some cases, pay more for prescription drugs than they currently do.</p>
        <p>''Tell your friends and neighbors to use the calculator to make sure you look at the fine print -- the fine print -- before people buy into a program that's going to mean more of the same,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said that Mr. Bush's characterizations of Mr. Gore's proposal were misleading or erroneous and that Mr. Gore, in strengthening Medicare, would be giving older Americans a guarantee of benefits that Mr. Bush would not.</p>
        <p>''Bush puts seniors off on the tender mercies of the insurance companies,'' Mr. Hattaway said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's focus on health care marked the beginning of a week in which his aides said he would confront Mr. Gore on issues like the environment and education that are  considered Democrats' strong suits.</p>
        <p>They said that their goal was to remind people that Mr. Bush is ''a different kind of Republican,'' one of the campaign's longstanding catch phrases, and that Mr. Bush was armed with ''real plans for real people,'' the campaign's newest slogan. The Bush campaign's target, clearly, is the pivotal group of undecided centrist voters without predetermined allegiances to either party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's stylistic efforts to reinvigorate his candidacy were also on display today. Instead of looking down at his audience of several hundred from a stage, he stood at eye level with them, pivoting this way and that as he answered questions about a variety of issues.</p>
        <p>He seemed more relaxed and confident, and he talked for more than 40 minutes, more than double the time of a standard stump speech just a week and a half ago.</p>
        <p>Just before his remarks, Mr. Bush met privately with three women who, according to campaign officials, would fare better under Mr. Bush's proposals for Medicare and prescription drug coverage than they would under Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>This represented the campaign's newly aggressive effort to put human faces on Mr. Bush's policy proposals. But while Mr. Bush's aides cited facts and figures to buttress their claim about the trio of supporters, reporters did not meet or have access to them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush was acutely conscious of the age and political interests of his audience, making a point of telling them that he would protect their Social Security benefits and that those benefits would not be endangered by his sweeping tax cut proposal. He moved through the arithmetic of that equation more fluidly than he had in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>To his aides, it was proof that their campaign was just fine. En route to Florida, Karen P. Hughes, the director of communications, told reporters that ''after our much publicized retooling efforts last week, I thought you all would be glad to know that we're going to be On Top of the World today -- literally.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes was right. It was the name of the Clearwater retirement complex.</p>
