        <p>Hewlett-Packard and PricewaterhouseCoopers confirmed yesterday that they were discussing the sale of the PricewaterhouseCoopers management and information technology consulting practice to Hewlett-Packard.</p>
        <p>Hewlett-Packard said it expected to pay $17 billion to $18 billion in cash and stock if the deal was completed.</p>
        <p>Analysts said such a deal would move Hewlett-Packard rapidly along the path of decreased dependence on hardware sales, following the lead of rivals like I.B.M. But some said that an alliance rather than an outright takeover might achieve many of the benefits for Hewlett-Packard with fewer risks and that the sheer magnitude of the purchase worried investors.</p>
        <p>Hewlett-Packard shares closed down $6.63 at $114.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>''It's not an argument about a bigger push into services,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. ''It's a question of how much magnitude, how quickly.''</p>
        <p>For PricewaterhouseCoopers, formed by the 1998 merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the deal would respond to concerns voiced by the Securities and Exchange Commission and others about potential conflicts of interest between its consulting arm and its traditional accounting and auditing practices. And although PricewaterhouseCoopers declined to discuss the potential financial rewards of the deal to its partners, people in the industry said they would be extremely lucrative and hard to resist.</p>
        <p>''Most partners will say it's a wonderful idea if they are getting this valuation,'' said Jon McKenna, editor of Public Accounting Report, an industry journal.</p>
        <p>The management consulting practice includes 31,000 employees and about 1,500 partners out of PricewaterhouseCoopers' worldwide total of 150,000 employees and 10,000 partners, according to David Nestor, a company spokesman. Mr. Nestor said PricewaterhouseCoopers would not discuss how any agreement with Hewlett-Packard would be voted on at the giant partnership or how the takeover spoils would be divided.</p>
        <p>Hewlett-Packard cautioned yesterday that some terms of the transaction had not been agreed upon and that significant issues remained to be resolved, leaving open the possibility that the deal might yet unravel. The company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said it expected the acquisition to add to the 15 percent revenue growth rate it has forecast, and to dilute its cash earnings per share mildly in fiscal year 2001. It said there would be no significant effect on earnings per share in fiscal year 2002.</p>
        <p>The steep price reflects the growing pressure on Hewlett-Packard as computer hardware becomes more and more like a commodity product with low profit margins. Hewlett-Packard has been hiring 200 consultants a month, according to some outside estimates, in the effort to build its consulting business. It hired Steven Hahn away from I.B.M. to run the business. But it would take a deal like adding PricewaterhouseCoopers' 30,000 consultants to its homegrown force of 6,000 to quickly push the company into the front ranks of the trend.</p>
        <p>''The nature of the business has changed because the customer is really paying for the solution, not the PC, minicomputer or mainframe,'' said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research. ''So the top of the food chain is the services and consulting business. And companies that were box providers, like H.P., have belatedly realized they were being left behind.''</p>
        <p>If the deal is completed, Hewlett-Packard's consulting arm would be roughly comparable to the Global Services Group of the Compaq Computer Corporation, which has 38,000 consultants around the world. Compaq built its consulting arm in large part through the acquisitions of the Digital Equipment Corporation and Tandem Computer.</p>
        <p>''We expect that what these guys are going to find, as Compaq did, is that everything doesn't just fall into place,'' said Jeffrey Lynn, vice president and general manager of Compaq Global Services. ''But I think it's a clear confirmation of what we, I.B.M. and others have concluded, that the way you've got to market with your enterprise solutions is a blend of technology and services.''</p>
