        <p>Juan Antonio Samaranch chuckled twice in public today, evidence, perhaps, that he is comfortable that the I.O.C. he leads is past being in a perpetual state of siege.

        <p>Juan Antonio Samaranch chuckled twice in public today, evidence, perhaps, that he is comfortable that the I.O.C. he leads is past being in a perpetual state of siege. Samaranch's cheerful gesture came early in the opening day of a three-day I.O.C. session leading up to the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics.</p>
        <p>The Games have not begun but the I.O.C. is faced with doubts about the credibility of a new test for the performance enhancer EPO, chastened by the Australian government's refusal to admit members of its ''family'' from Uzbekistan and Hong Kong and constantly under scrutiny about the efficacy of reforms enacted last year following the Salt Lake City bribery scandal.</p>
        <p>''Beleaguered? Beleaguered by whom?'' said Francois Carrard, the I.O.C.'s director general.</p>
        <p>But these days are not entirely normal for the I.O.C. -- and not just because Samaranch was stranded the other day by an Olympic van outside the Regent Hotel, where he is staying. In the I.O.C.'s attempt to be more egalitarian and transparent, the president and his delegates have given up limousine transport for something more plebeian.</p>
        <p>A local transport official apologized to Samaranch and the error has not been repeated since.</p>
