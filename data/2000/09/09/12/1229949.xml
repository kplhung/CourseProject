        <p>During a critical 90-minute meeting in his Manhattan hotel suite last week, President Clinton listened for productive ideas from the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, to help the badly flagging Middle East peace talks.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Arafat suggested that the Jerusalem Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference be given sovereignty over Haram al-Sharif, known to Jews as Temple Mount, the holy site in Jerusalem that has become the make-or-break issue of the talks, senior Clinton Administration officials said today. Mr. Clinton and his advisers thought that Mr. Arafat's idea was pretty much a nonstarter, the officials said.</p>
        <p>They interpreted the notion, which they said was only vaguely sketched by Mr. Arafat, as an attempt to pass to a group of Arab countries the weighty question of sovereignty over an ancient space that is sacred to Muslims and Jews and a cradle of both religions.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Iran and Iraq, which  oppose the very existence of the peace talks, are among the group's 56 members. The chairman of the Jerusalem committee is Morocco, and its 16 members include moderate Arab nations, like Egypt and Jordan, as well as Iran, Iraq and Syria.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, in his role as a mediator, told Mr. Arafat what Israel's objections would be, an aide said. Roughly stated, Mr. Clinton explained that if the Israelis could not accept exclusive Palestinian sovereignty, they would not accept the sovereignty of a group of Islamic countries. The essence of the message was that Mr. Arafat's solution met his own needs, but not those of the Israelis.</p>
        <p>The general atmosphere in the president's suite at the Waldorf Astoria was, as always, quite civil and proper, administration officials said.</p>
        <p>But in the moments before meeting with Mr. Clinton, Mr. Arafat had stalked out of a session in the hotel with the Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, saying he had to consult with his delegation waiting down the hall. Earlier in the day, Mr. Arafat became quite heated in an interview on CNN, in which he and the journalist Christiane Amanpour tested each other's wills on every point.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat's theatrical behavior was interpreted by some officials as a desire on his part to show to his people, and the Muslim world at large, that he was in a struggle to the end on a peace accord.</p>
        <p>In the president's suite, apparently to make up for walking out earlier, Mr. Arafat interrupted the meeting at one point and went over to Dr. Albright and smothered her with kisses, according to someone in the room.</p>
        <p>It is far from clear exactly what Mr. Arafat's timetable is and whether the critical political situation in Israel, which is likely to end the Barak government in its current form, is part of his calculations, officials said.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Arafat left New York  last Friday, one of his senior aides said that the Palestinians would start intensive talks with Israelis and that they would extend for the next five weeks the informal deadline by which time Mr. Barak must make some decisions about how to shape a new government. But there appeared to be little optimism within the administration or by the Israelis that those steps would produce much.</p>
        <p>Following the decision on Sunday by the Palestinians to defer a declaration of statehood for at least two months, Mr. Arafat flew to Egypt today for a 90-minute meeting with President Hosni Mubarak that appeared to confirm the generally gloomy prognostications for the new talks. The meeting followed a longstanding pattern of Mr. Arafat conferring with the Egyptian leader at critical moments in the peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>Egypt's information minister, Safwat al-Shareef, told reporters after Mr. Arafat's plane left on the return journey to the Palestinian headquarters in Gaza that Mr. Arafat had given Mr. Mubarak an extremely pessimistic report on the talks in New York.</p>
        <p>American officials said that there appeared to be one enticing element of Mr. Arafat's presentation to Mr. Clinton, though. It showed, some said, that Mr. Arafat knew he could not get an agreement with the Israelis if he continued to insist on sole Palestinian sovereignty of Haram al-Sharif.</p>
        <p>It may have been an attempt by Mr. Arafat to show Mr. Clinton -- whom he consistently describes to diplomats as his ''friend'' -- that he was trying. But his proposal did not address the sticking point for the Israelis.</p>
        <p>''If the Israelis cannot accept exclusive Palestinian sovereignty, they are not going to accept a group of countries' sovereignty,'' an administration official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat's proposal also came as the Americans were trying desperately to move the discussion away from any form of exclusive sovereignty and toward the concept of shared sovereignty between Israel and the Palestinians, or better still, the concept of ''divine sovereignty.''</p>
        <p>According to this idea, the two Muslim shrines at the site, the Dome of the Rock and Al Aksa, and the area under the earth where the First and Second Jewish temples stood, would be under the sovereignty of God, an idea that was once broached by King Hussein during his reign in Jordan.</p>
        <p>In one way, accepting the sovereignty under God as a solution would keep the status quo at the site, which is run on a day-to-day basis by Muslim clergy and guarded by Arab security.</p>
        <p>Jews rarely visit the site. As Amos Elon described it in his book, ''Jerusalem, City of Mirrors,'' a rabbinic injunction forbids Jews to set foot anywhere on the Temple Mount for fear of a possible desecration of the site of the former Holy of Holies. Though this is often thought to be under the Dome of the Rock, its exact location is not known, Mr. Elon wrote.</p>
        <p>By the end of Mr. Arafat's visit to New York, administration officials were somewhat dismayed, seeing momentum of their summit meeting six weeks ago all but frittered away.</p>
        <p>In his frequent diplomatic encounters since the Camp David summit meeting, where the history of Haram al-Sharif and the Temple Mount were first discussed by senior Israelis and Palestinians, Mr. Arafat has denied that the Jewish history of the site exists, officials said.</p>
        <p>By trying to move toward a solution that suggested sovereignty under God, the administration hoped that the deep and bitter arguments of religious identity and the history of thousands of years -- an exercise that could go on indefinitely -- would not have to be opened.</p>
