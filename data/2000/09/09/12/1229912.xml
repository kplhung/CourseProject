        <p>Editorial says firing of Bob Knight as basketball coach at Indiana University was long overdue; praises 20-year-old Russian player Marat Safin's victory over Pete Sampras to capture men's title at US Open in three straight sets; says it will give sleepy world of men's tennis badly needed jolt; lauds Tiger Woods's victory in Canadian Open (M)</p>

        <p>Baseball and football have yet to produce their main story lines for 2000, and the summer Olympics that open this week in Australia will generate many of the year's most memorable athletic images. But for sports aficionados this past weekend provided plenty of nourishment. The University of Indiana finally summoned the gumption to fire Bob Knight as basketball coach, a gifted young Russian tennis player gave the sleepy world of men's tennis a badly needed jolt and Tiger Woods added another golf title to one of the greatest championship years anyone has ever achieved in sports.</p>
        <p>The dismissal of Mr. Knight was long overdue. His abusive treatment of players, colleagues and officials was condoned by university administrators because Mr. Knight brought the school three N.C.A.A. championships and 11 Big Ten Conference titles in 29 years at Indiana. His bullying behavior continued even after the university set a ''zero tolerance'' policy for the coach last spring. Even so, Myles Brand, the university president, managed to ignore the strict code until a confrontation between Mr. Knight and a student last week became a public issue. Mr. Knight's unruly partisans might ponder the example of John Wooden, who won 10 N.C.A.A. titles at U.C.L.A. without intimidating his players.</p>

        <p>The dismissal of Mr. Knight was long overdue.

        <p>After dominating men's tennis for a decade, and collecting a record 13 Grand Slam titles, Pete Sampras may have met his successor on Sunday in the United States Open. Marat Safin, a 20-year-old Russian with an overpowering serve and laser-like ground strokes, disposed of Sampras in three quick sets. His emergence may give the men's game the kind of compelling new rivalry that women's tennis enjoys with the wondrous Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, and their top rivals.</p>
        <p>As for Tiger Woods, a year of unsurpassed excellence seemed complete after he won the P.G.A.  tournament last month, giving him three of golf's four major titles in 2000. But by triumphing in the Canadian Open on Sunday, Woods brought his overall victory total this year to nine and became only the second player to win the United States, British and Canadian Opens in the same year. Someone will have to win a bucket of gold medals in Sydney to eclipse Woods as athlete of the year.</p>
