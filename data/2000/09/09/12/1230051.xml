        <p>The Devils are contemplating a reduction in the number of games played by Martin Brodeur, their premier goaltender.</p>
        <p>Brodeur, who has played more than 70 games in each of the last three seasons, played 72 in the regular season last year and all 23 playoff games it took the Devils to capture the Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to sit down with the coaching staff and tentatively schedule the games for the goaltenders,'' New Jersey Coach Larry Robinson said after yesterday's practice in West Orange. ''I'd like to see Marty play fewer games and Chris play a few more.''</p>
        <p>Chris Terreri appeared in only 12 games last season as the backup to Brodeur, who came into camp about five pounds lighter than last season.</p>
        <p>''You know me, I want to play every game,'' Brodeur said. ''They know I like to play a lot, and I don't really expect to play less. I know Chris wants to play a few more and I'll tell you what I'll do: I will let Chris play all the games in training camp if he wants to.''</p>
        <p>Terreri, who has been Brodeur's backup the last two seasons, has been so well suited to that role that Lou Lamoriello, the president and general manager, went out of his way to get him back from Minnesota after the Wild claimed him in the expansion draft in June.</p>
        <p>''I'll stay ready when Marty needs the rest,'' Terreri said, speaking about the possible increase in games he would play. ''I do what the coaches tell me.''</p>
