        <p>Bouncing Buckyball</p>
        <p>To the list of remarkable properties of those single-molecule spheres of carbon atoms known as buckyballs can be added another: they bounce.</p>
        <p>Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have controlled the movement of a buckyball by making it the centerpiece of a tiny transistor. (Buckyballs consist of 60 carbon atoms and are more formally called buckminsterfullerenes, in honor of the inventor of the geodesic dome, which has the same kind of structure.)</p>
        <p>In a typical transistor, like those found by the millions on a computer chip, a voltage from a gate electrode controls the current that flows between two other electrodes, known as the source and drain, across a semiconducting material. In the Berkeley transistor, a buckyball sits between the source and drain electrodes, and the current flows one electron at a time.</p>
        <p>Depending on the energy of the electron, it will either be reflected from the buckyball (thus, the transistor is ''off'') or it will hop across to the other electrode (the transistor is ''on,'' allowing current to flow). And at certain energies, the researchers report in Nature, when the electron hops across, it starts the buckyball bouncing between the electrodes.</p>
        <p>The researchers suggest that this coupling between the electron's energy and the movement of the buckyball may have eventual applications in very precise control of electron flow in molecular-scale devices. In the meantime, bouncing buckyballs may be a curiosity, but perhaps not a surprising one. After all, a buckyball's structure of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons is just like that of a classic soccer ball.</p>
        <p>Tiniest Fullerene</p>
        <p>A sphere of 60 carbon atoms is not the smallest fullerene possible. That distinction belongs to one made up of 20 atoms arranged in 12 pentagons, with no hexagons. (Those who paid attention in school know that this structure is called a dodecahedron.)</p>
        <p>The problem with this fullerene was that no one had ever seen it. There were even doubts that it could exist, given the strain caused by the high degree of curvature of such a sphere.</p>
        <p>Those doubts have now disappeared, thanks to work by chemists in Germany and the United States, who report in Nature that they have produced the smallest fullerene, although only in its gas phase and only fleetingly.</p>
        <p>The researchers made the molecule using dodecahedrane, which has the right 20-carbon structure as its core but comes with hydrogen atoms attached. By gently stripping off the hydrogen atoms in a two-step process, they were able to produce the fullerene.</p>
        <p>El Nino's Child: Cholera</p>
        <p>El Nino has been blamed for many things, from destruction of million-dollar hillside homes in California to shrinking marine iguanas on the Galapagos Islands.</p>
        <p>Now, researchers from Cornell and the universities of Maryland, Barcelona and London have come up with a new reason to curse El Nino: they have linked it to cholera outbreaks in Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>Using mathematical models and data on cholera cases collected over 18 years at a hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the researchers analyzed the role of climate and previous levels of the disease on outbreak patterns. They found that cholera reached a peak every 3.7 years over the 18-year period, the same frequency as El Nino events, in which warming waters in the eastern Pacific disrupt weather patterns worldwide.</p>
        <p>Cholera is caused by a bacterium that thrives in plankton in brackish water and in estuaries. The researchers, in a report in Science, suggest that warming of these waters caused by El Nino-related atmospheric changes increases bacteria levels and the risks of human contamination. They note there is an 11-month lag between an El Nino and a rise in cholera cases, which makes sense given that it takes time for the ocean warming in the eastern Pacific to bring about climate changes in South Asia.</p>
