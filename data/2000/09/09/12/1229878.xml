        <p>For anyone who has read his new biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix, cuts an almost jarringly unassuming figure.</p>
        <p>It is not unheard of for historians to praise the work of others or to insist that they deserve only a modest portion of the credit for casting light on their chosen periods. But over lunch here the other day, Mr. Bix went a step further, insisting that he did not want anyone to think that with ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'' (HarperCollins) he had uncovered any deep, dark secrets about a leader who always lived scrupulously shrouded behind a heavy veil throughout his 62 years on the throne.</p>
        <p>As the author eagerly acknowledges, much of the information in his book was uncovered and carefully researched by Japanese colleagues, only to be almost completely ignored by the public as the country's newspapers and major publishers shrank from taking on such a project.</p>
        <p>The triumph of Mr. Bix, 61, is that of a tailor able to assemble disparate scraps of material and sew them into a seamless whole. Relying heavily on the diaries and letters of the emperor's advisers and contemporaries, he has produced a picture of a militarily aggressive leader who was minutely informed, often literally down to the minute, about Japan's war efforts.</p>
        <p>Authorities on Japan in the United States have rushed to declare that the new biography definitively changes the widely accepted view of Hirohito, who died in 1989, as a virtual hostage of a clique of militarists during the war in the Pacific and a peace-loving, avuncular symbol of the nation afterward.</p>
        <p>With the search for a Japanese publisher still under way, the more interesting question for this Harvard historian who has devoted his life to Japanese studies and currently teaches at the elite Hitotsubashi University here is whether the Japanese will finally begin to reappraise the emperor now that Mr. Bix's book has so thoroughly decked him out in new clothes. Given Japan's willingness to avert its eyes from the most troubling chapters of its history and to resist critical self-evaluation and discussion of the country's atrocities in China and Korea and the militarism that led to the Pacific war, Mr. Bix says he considers it unlikely.</p>
        <p>''When you face restrictions like I was given, I'm skeptical,'' he said, citing among other experiences the refusal of a major newspaper publisher here to allow him to view a 67-year-old war-propaganda film featuring Hirohito. ''The right wing is constantly recycling myths about the lost war, and the mind-set here hasn't changed much. Before it does, there will have to be laws that will protect companies that publish or broadcast critical things on this subject.''</p>
        <p>Publishing houses have been attacked in the past for producing works critical of the emperor. Right-wing sound trucks, which blare high-decibel denunciations to enforce a kind of nationalist political correctness, are still common here.</p>
        <p>But in his distinct Boston accent, which pervades his fluent Japanese, Mr. Bix said almost plaintively that he did not want to see his book used by people to browbeat Japan over its past. ''I don't want the Japanese people to wallow in this,'' he said. ''I want them to put it behind them. I don't have an ax to grind. I want something positive to come out of it. That would start with an excavation of the facts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bix's description of the origins of his fascination with Japan sounds almost like a fateful epiphany. ''I read a book about the place when I was in high school, about the Imperial Way,'' he said. ''It got me interested in Japan, and after I finished my studies in officer candidate school I was stationed there.''</p>
        <p>After a stint in the country as a Navy officer, he went to Harvard University, where he earned his doctorate in Japanese history, studying there at the same time as John Dower, the author of ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'' (W. W. Norton), a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of Japan's postwar transformation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bix's book had been in gestation for many years, during which he said the two men sometimes shared materials. Strangely, though, what would become a defining book about the emperor started out as a much broader project, a portrait of Japan's elites as they struggled to come to terms with modernization.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't even interested in Hirohito when this began,'' Mr. Bix said. ''But little by little his story grew on me. He became the center. I wasn't even preoccupied with the question of war guilt. I was trying to tell the story of Japan's 20th-century trajectory, but what I found was like looking through a kaleidoscope; you turn things and make a teeny little change. Suddenly the key person, the man who has been removed from the picture, is at the center where he belongs.''</p>
        <p>In the end Hirohito cannot escape responsibility for the war, Mr. Bix said, because ''he was the only free man in all of Japan.''</p>
        <p>''Free in a double sense: he was never until the very end lacking in options,'' he said. ''And he was free in the sense that there was no person above him to whom his will was subject, except his ancestors.''</p>
        <p>The story of how Hirohito had been removed from the center of the picture, as Mr. Bix tells it, is as interesting as the details of the emperor's transition from the unsteady hand on the throne to the true war leader: the transition of a man always acquiescing after the fact in decisions taken by his military chiefs, as he did during Japan's Manchurian expansionism, to the outright hawk urging his generals to fight on when even they knew the cause was lost in the war with the United States.</p>
        <p>Here, though, the unexamined lessons are shared equally between vanquished and victor. After the war the United States was in a hurry to fill the vacuum left by Japan's collapse and to face the new strategic challenges posed by the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Worse still, Mr. Bix says, Gen. Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan as the country's supreme commander under the occupation with ready-made plans to use the emperor to establish a pro-American peace.</p>
        <p>The Japanese people may have thirsted briefly for a justice that included judgment of the emperor. Even his brothers were apparently ready to jettison Hirohito, considering him an unworthy failure. The Americans would have none of it, though, and MacArthur, enjoying extraordinary leeway over Japan policy, worked closely with Hirohito to set up suitable fall guys for the Tokyo War Tribunal and keep the throne out of the picture.</p>
        <p>Critical was the famous letter MacArthur wrote to his superiors in Washington claiming that his best efforts to look into the matter had turned up no evidence of imperial culpability for the war, and saying that it would take a million troops to keep the peace in Japan if the emperor were removed.</p>
        <p>The emperor's handlers, almost dumbstruck by their good fortune, wasted no time taking advantage of the situation, touring the nation almost triumphantly and encouraging the repetition of their old justifications for the Pacific war, which held that Washington had forced Tokyo to attack.</p>
        <p>''When he gets to Japan, MacArthur is in a rush, and he is on a roll,'' Mr. Bix said. ''That is to say that he wants to get in there quickly and do it quickly. Putting war criminals on trial is distasteful, but it is one of his duties under the Potsdam Declaration. So he wants to get it over quickly and make a name for himself so that he can run in the general election in the United States.</p>
        <p>''Everything happens so fast, and Japanese people are never given a chance to reflect on the issue of war responsibility and on the role that the monarchy had planned and the emperor had played.''</p>
        <p>However much Mr. Bix insisted that the question of war responsibility was his original objective, he said with a sigh, ''Maybe my book will help.''</p>
