        <p>Few people in the upper ranks of the New England Patriots organization had gotten much sleep one particular week early in 1998. Bill Parcells, the former head coach and someone many in the organization despised, was the cause. Behind his back, some Patriots employees used to joke about adding a holiday to the calendar called ''Punch Bill in the Face Day.''</p>
        <p>Obviously, there was no love lost when Parcells skipped out on his contract with the Patriots and jumped to the Jets. Then the enmity intensified that week two years ago when Parcells, as coach of the Jets, signed one of the Patriots' best players, running back Curtis Martin, to a six-year contract. Worse, the $36 million contract included a poison pill that was a $3.3 million roster bonus. If New England matched the deal for Martin, a restricted free agent, it could wreck its salary cap.</p>
        <p>Parcells knew this, and the Patriots knew that he knew, which only infuriated them more. After looking for holes in the contract that were not there, the Patriots finally made a decision that would change the fortunes of both franchises for years. They decided not to match the offer, let Martin walk and take the first- and third-round draft selections as compensation.</p>
        <p>In hindsight it was one of the worst decisions for the Patriots and one of the best for the Jets.</p>
        <p>Somewhat lost in the chaos of the Jets-Patriots Tuna Bowl last night -- from the news media buildup, one would think this was some XFL fight to the death with chain saws pay-per-view event -- is the loud impact of the quiet Martin. A simple free-agent signing can still be felt, both here and in New England.</p>
        <p>The Martin signing drastically changed the fortunes of both franchises, for the better for the Jets, and for the worse for the Patriots. While I have never been a fan of Parcells because of the harsh way he treats people and his poor draft record with the Jets, his bold move in grabbing Martin is one of the top five free-agent signings of all time. It was quite simply a brilliant gamble that paid off handsomely.</p>
        <p>Last night, Martin played the game with a sprained left knee. He wasn't as crisp as normal, gaining only 39 yards on 8 carries in the first half. New England often stacked the line of scrimmage with eight men, daring quarterback Vinny Testaverde and the wide receivers to beat them. Without a speed-burning threat to loosen up the defense, Martin was doomed.</p>
        <p>New England Coach Bill Belichick's game plan slowed the Jets' offense. Make no mistake: as good as Martin is -- his more than 1,700 career carries in his first 77 games is second most in league history -- the Patriots demonstrated that a team with good cornerbacks like Ty Law can mostly shut down the Jets' smallish receivers with one-on-one coverage. That in turn allows a defense to commit more resources to stopping Martin.</p>
        <p>Martin, despite the pounding his body takes, rarely misses games. That wasn't always the case. Martin had a series of injuries before the Jets signed him to a free-agent offer sheet, so the Patriots were correct in thinking there were longevity issues. New England's mistake, a huge one, was that they underestimated Martin's will, which is formidable.</p>
        <p>Martin has 6,300 yards in his five-year career, meaning he has averaged more than 1,200 yards per season. Last year with the Jets he had a career-high 1,464 yards.</p>
        <p>The Patriots? They used that No. 1 pick from the Martin compensation to draft running back Robert Edwards. He rushed for 1,115 yards his rookie year (to Martin's 1,287), then seriously injured his knee while playing in a flag football game at the Pro Bowl in Hawaii. He has missed two consecutive years, and his career is probably over. With the third-round selection, the Patriots got fullback Chris Floyd, who is a backup.</p>
        <p>When comparing free-agent signings, the Jets' acquisition of Martin ranks among the best in modern history. My good friend Peter King from Sports Illustrated sent me an e-mail message with his top 10. They're dead on. He ranks Martin as the third best, with Green Bay's signing of Reggie White in 1993 at No. 1 and Dallas's signing of Deion Sanders in 1995 as No. 2. Other than White and Sanders, no free agent has had the kind of impact that Martin has had, while conversely, his absence left a void in New England the franchise has yet to fill.</p>
        <p>Those sleepless nights the Patriots were having when Parcells first came calling for Martin? Two years later, they're still having them.</p>
