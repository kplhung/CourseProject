        <p>The Australian swim coach Don Talbot dismissed talk of a rancorous rivalry developing between his swimmers and those from the favored American team today. Responding to questions about trash-talking between the teams, Talbot said:</p>
        <p>''This is not a dual meet with the Americans. If you really want to get down to it, it's the world ganging up on the U.S. We don't have a strong enough team to defeat the Americans by ourselves.''</p>

        <p>Talbot conceded that his team hopes to use the home advantage. Led by the Wunderkind Ian Thorpe, the Australians have a number of strong medal contenders.</p>
