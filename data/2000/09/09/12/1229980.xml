        <p>The price of home heating oil surged to a 10-year high yesterday as traders discounted the impact of a decision over the weekend by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase crude oil production by 800,000 barrels a day.</p>
        <p>In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of heating oil for October delivery jumped 5.49 cents, or 5.5 percent, to $1.0498 a gallon, its highest since October 1990, after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The price of crude oil rose $1.51, or 4.5 percent, to $35.14, just below the 10-year high it reached last Thursday.</p>
        <p>At its current price in the futures market, home heating oil is now 51 percent higher than the average for last fall and winter and is likely to become a bigger issue in the presidential election, especially if October is cold.</p>
        <p>''We welcome the reports that OPEC member governments will increase oil production by 800,000 barrels per day,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Sunday. ''Whether such an increase will stabilize the market remains to be seen.'' He also said the administration was still considering releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
        <p>The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, urged consumers last week to fill up their home heating oil tanks early, instead of waiting for the first cold weather. More and more analysts have said that this increase in OPEC production -- and any further increase OPEC may approve at its next meeting on Nov. 12 -- will arrive too late to help. It takes about six weeks for the crude oil to get to the United States and another week or 10 days to refine it.</p>
        <p>''The issue is heating oil, timing and the weather,'' said Irene King, a senior oil markets analyst at J. P. Morgan &amp; Company. ''And the increase will come too late to do anything for the home heating oil price. Now there is a panic on the price and it's 80 degrees outside.''</p>
        <p>Phil Flynn, senior energy market analyst of Alaron.com, said, ''The market is saying we're going to have shortages this winter.''</p>
        <p>In response to the OPEC announcement, which was formalized in Vienna yesterday, traders and analysts said there would be only about 100,000 to 150,000 new barrels of oil produced because OPEC members were already ''cheating'' by pumping more than their current quotas.</p>
        <p>For the near term, an oil inventory report by the American Petroleum Institute after the close of trading today and a similar report from the Energy Information Administration that will be issued on Wednesday morning will have an important impact on the price of oil and home heating oil. Although the crude oil inventory has been rising in recent weeks, it is still almost 22 million barrels below its level at this time last year and not too far from a 24-year low. The distillate inventory, from which home heating oil is made, is 28 million barrels below its level at this time last year.</p>
        <p>In addition to strong consumer demand and low inventories, traders said that hedge funds and other speculators who are betting on the price of oil are also a major factor in the price rise.</p>
        <p>One of those traders, who talked on the condition of not being identified, said yesterday that he would not be surprised to see the price of crude oil ''spike to $40 a barrel.'' He had bet on rising oil prices for a while and then sold out, expecting that the price might drop. Now, he said, ''I am looking for levels to get back in.''</p>
        <p>There was an unconfirmed rumor yesterday that a foreign speculator had bet that the OPEC announcement would drive oil prices lower. He sold oil futures contracts, hoping to profit when the price fell. But when it began to rally he had to buy oil to minimize his losses, helping drive the price higher.</p>
        <p>Home heating oil and crude oil prices also rallied despite the promise of some OPEC officials that the cartel would consider increasing production before their Nov. 12 meeting if prices went out of control. Mexico, which is not a member of OPEC, said it would increase production by up to 200,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter if prices remained high.</p>
        <p>Most analysts say the price of oil will decline over the next 12 months as new fields begin pumping oil and as demand abates. But analysts have been predicting that the price of crude oil will begin to fall again ''soon'' during much of the 20 months the price has been rising. The prices of oil for delivery in future months, which have been lower than the current-month price, have also been a bad forecaster. The price for crude oil for January delivery is now $32.87 a barrel. It was $28 a barrel two months ago.</p>
        <p>OPEC's intention to stabilize the market backfired in large measure because of the uncertainty about how much so-called new oil will enter pipelines. Statistics on worldwide oil production, including OPEC's, are estimates at best, and industry analysts believe that OPEC produced anywhere from 650,000 barrels to 750,000 barrels a day above the official quota it set at its June meeting, with most of the extra oil coming from Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>Seeking to quash speculation that the 800,000-barrel rise in quotas would include current overproduction, the OPEC secretary general, Rilwanu Lukman, told a news conference yesterday that the entire increase would be new.</p>
        <p>But most market experts remain skeptical, given that only Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and perhaps Iran now have the spare capacity to increase output. All other OPEC countries and their allies like Norway and Mexico were at or very near maximum capacity even before the 800,000-barrel increase was negotiated.</p>
        <p>Still, by the end of the year, if not by October, new oil should be flowing. Most oil-producing countries, whether members of OPEC or not, are scrambling to bring new fields on line to take advantage of soaring prices. ''All the OPEC countries are bringing new production on line,'' said Roger Diwan, managing director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting group. ''We think that by the end of the year, there should be about 500,000 to 700,000 barrels a day of new oil from OPEC.''</p>
        <p>Such forecasts are cold comfort to today's market. Adding to the low- inventory problem is the fact that domestic refineries are running at 95 percent of capacity, and many are shutting down for a few weeks in the autumn for seasonal maintenance. The OPEC crude, because it is heavier in sulfur, is also not the preferred source of heating oil. ''If this is a problem of heating oil and refined products in the U.S., I don't know how more crude oil will help,'' one European analyst said.</p>
        <p>The negative reaction of the market to the OPEC increase puts Saudi Arabia, the cartel's de facto leader, in a tough spot. It is under persistent pressure from the United States to drive down prices by arranging for OPEC to increase production.</p>
        <p>The concern within OPEC is producing too much now and sending the price of oil into a precipitous fall when new production begins. ''We of course fear an overhang of oil because we do expect prices to come down,'' said Abdulla Salatt, the governor to OPEC from Qatar.</p>
        <p>But OPEC clearly lacks the tools to start a steady decline in the cost of crude. Most analysts in Vienna agreed that the 800,000-barrel increase was probably the best the cartel could do. This meeting apparently lacked the rancorous debates that have marked many previous sessions, because more members are uneasy about the high price of crude.</p>
