        <p>Sometimes two companies can have the same name, and sometimes news services can make mistakes.</p>
        <p>Shares in PSA Inc., an aspiring broadband services company based in Los Angeles, trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board under the ticker symbol PSAX, usually in low volume. By 12:10 p.m. yesterday, 2,500 shares had traded, and the price had risen 6 cents, to $4.94.</p>
        <p>Then the Dow Jones News Service reported that PSA Inc. had filed for bankruptcy. The report listed its ticker symbol as PSAX.</p>
        <p>The sell orders soon poured in, and by 12:35 the share price had fallen to $1.75, or 65 percent less than the price before the report. At 12:42, Dow Jones corrected the report, saying that the company that filed for bankruptcy was a different PSA Inc. That PSA is an unrelated, privately held company, Dow Jones said.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day, the publicly traded PSA shares had recovered to $4.19, down 69 cents for the day. Volume came to 213,700 shares, or more than had traded in the last three weeks combined.</p>
