        <p>Wayne Chrebet walked on to the field at Giants Stadium about two hours before kickoff last night in shorts and a T-shirt, a big white wrap from the middle of his left calf down.</p>
        <p>Chrebet moved well while catching warm-up passes and, while he appeared to walk somewhat gingerly, there was no pronounced limp.</p>
        <p>Chrebet, who was questionable for the game with a ''lower leg injury'' to his left leg, played, although the location and extent of the injury was not clarified before the game. The wrap was gone by the opening kickoff.</p>
        <p>Chrebet's status was in question after he landed awkwardly when going up to catch a pass during Saturday's practice. Chrebet has been bothered by injuries in the last three years.</p>
        <p>In 1998, he sprained his left ankle and in 1999, he missed five games with a broken left foot, which hindered him throughout the year. He had 48 receptions for 631 yards and 3 touchdowns in 11 games last season.</p>
        <p>Chrebet also missed a preseason game this year with an undisclosed illness.</p>
        <p>The Brisby Affair</p>
        <p>Among all the internecine entanglements this rivalry presents, the freshest is the case of Jets receiver Vincent Brisby, who hours after his shocking release by the Patriots last month, was being wooed by the Jets.</p>
        <p>Brisby began the Patriots' training camp as a starter, but after he was released, Drew Bledsoe -- Brisby's quarterback for the last seven years -- said in an interview that Brisby was cut because he had lost speed down the sideline.</p>
        <p>''I was kind of a little shocked when I heard that,'' Brisby said this week.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what he actually meant by that. I thought I was having a good camp. I haven't had a chance to talk to him so, I'm not going to throw a shot back at him.''</p>
