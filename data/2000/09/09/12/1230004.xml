        <p>The chairman of the Democratic Party organization in Rockland County was charged today with public corruption after prosecutors said he had enriched himself by almost $375,000 through a series of real estate transactions tainted by fraud, bribery and extortion.</p>
        <p>Paul W. Adler, the party chairman, was one of the county's earlier and most ardent supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton in her race for the United States Senate. Rockland is expected to be an important swing region in the contest.</p>
        <p>Federal prosecutors accused Mr. Adler of having threatened local politicians with the loss of their jobs if they did not cooperate with him on several deals, including one involving the controversial and gigantic Palisades Center mall in West Nyack. In one secretly tape-recorded conversation, he argued that he had not assumed the party chairmanship to ''lose money,'' said Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p>
        <p>''If you can't help your friends, then why get into some of these positions?'' Mr. Adler was quoted as saying in an eight-count complaint filed against him.</p>
        <p>Another Democratic stalwart in the county, Sean Purdy, the town attorney for Haverstraw and chairman of the party's law committee, was also arrested yesterday. He was charged in a separate two-count complaint with having tried to bribe real estate developers. The Haverstraw Town Board immediately suspended Mr. Purdy from his $85,000 a year job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adler and Mr. Purdy pleaded not guilty in an appearance before a federal magistrate, Mark D. Fox, and were released without bail.</p>
        <p>Although the two men were not accused of acting in concert, their arrests grew out of an ongoing investigation into corruption, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>If convicted, Mr. Adler, 42, could face a 60-year sentence and a $2 million fine, while Mr. Purdy, 43, could face a 10-year sentence and a $500,000 fine, Ms. White said.</p>
        <p>''Duty seemed not to matter to these defendants,'' Ms. White said at a news conference today in White Plains. ''Instead, they saw public service as a path to private enrichment.''</p>
        <p>In a brief telephone interview, Mr. Adler, a commercial real estate broker, sounded dejected. ''I have dedicated my life to public service,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He then referred further questions to his lawyer, Murray Richman. Mr. Richman said that his client had ''categorically denied the charges.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adler has become the latest county political party leader in New York State to run afoul of federal prosecutors in recent years. Within the last five months, party officials in Dutchess and Suffolk (both Republicans) and in Nassau (a Democrat) have been sentenced on a variety of convictions.</p>
        <p>But perhaps none of those leaders had the influence of Mr. Adler, who was credited by Democrats with consolidating a potent alliance of Hudson Valley Democrats; was rumored to be a possible successor to the current state Democratic Party chairwoman, Judith Hope; and had developed a close alliance with Mrs. Clinton. In fact, Mrs. Clinton has stayed overnight in Mr. Adler's house during some of her frequent trips to Rockland, Democratic leaders say.</p>
        <p>The timing of today's federal complaint was less than ideal for the Democrats, coming one day before the state primary and two months before the general election.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Representative Rick Lazio, wasted no time in linking Mr. Adler to Mrs. Clinton, demanding that her campaign return $1,500 in donations from Mr. Adler and sever his ties as an unofficial adviser. In response, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, Cathie Levine, said: ''Hillary knows that this is a difficult time for Paul and his family and she wishes them well.''</p>
        <p>The charges followed a 15-month investigation by by federal authorities and the Rockland County District Attorney's Office.</p>
        <p>The charges against Mr. Adler relate to three complicated transactions. The first involved a property called Smith Farm, in Mr. Adler's hometown, Clarkstown. Prosecutors say Mr. Adler conspired to bribe a member of the Clarkstown Planning Board.</p>
        <p>The second charge accuses Mr. Adler of having hidden a financial arrangement with the developer of the Palisades Center, also in Clarkstown.</p>
        <p>The third accuses him of having had a secret profit-sharing agreement with several parties in an attempt to make money off of a planned municipal golf course.</p>
        <p>In 1988, Mr. Adler, then a lobbyist for a developer, was acquitted of bribery, conspiracy and other charges relating to the relocation of state offices from the World Trade Center in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>Since the early 1990's, Mr. Adler has made a name for himself as a tireless party leader willing to work with Republicans. The party chairman for the last four years, he was credited with helping the Democrats take control of the county legislature in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adler had been expected to run for re-election as party chairman. But Democratic leaders said today that they had received a letter from Mr. Adler saying that he had taken himself out of the running to concentrate on the legal battle ahead.</p>
