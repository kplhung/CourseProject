        <p>FleetBoston Financial, one of the nation's biggest banks, plans to announce today that it will offer a Visa credit card with a microchip that can store account information and can be used, with a swipe through a magnetic-stripe reader, to make purchases on the Internet. The card, named Fusion, will be available starting next Monday and will be the first mass-produced ''smart card'' to carry the Visa brand in the United States, said Joseph Saunders, chief executive of Fleet's credit card operations. The card's chip will keep track of credit balances, frequent-flier miles and other data, he said. American Express has issued a Blue card meant for electronic purchases, but for the most part, American consumers have been slower than those in Europe and Japan to accept smart cards.</p>
