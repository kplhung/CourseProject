      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Richard Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle'' is meeting ''Star Wars.''</p>
        <p>Placido Domingo, the new artistic director of the Los Angeles Opera, announced today that George Lucas's special effects company, Industrial Light and Magic, would design a new version of ''The Ring.'' The epic, beginning with ''Das Rheingold'' in 2003, will span two seasons.</p>
        <p>Industrial Light and Magic is best known for its innovative work on ''Star Wars,'' ''Jurassic Park'' and ''E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.''</p>
        <p>''We are in California,'' said Mr. Domingo, who replaced Peter Hemmings, general director of the company since its inception in 1986. ''We will have a 'Ring' that approaches the California style, in a way. Why not use the California style in our operas?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Domingo, who approached the Lucas people to do the ''Ring,'' said several filmmakers would also be staging operas over the next few years. William Friedkin (''The French Connection'') will direct Bartok's ''Bluebeard's Castle'' and Puccini's ''Gianni Schicchi'' in the 2001-02 season. Maximilian Schell, who directed ''Tales From the Vienna Woods,'' a stage play, at the National Theater in London in 1977, will mount Wagner's ''Lohengrin'' next year. John Schlesinger (''Midnight Cowboy'') is directing Benjamin Britten's ''Peter Grimes.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Domingo, who will be doing some conducting for the company, said he was talking to filmmakers as varied as Baz Luhrmann (''Strictly Ballroom'') and Pedro Almodovar (''All About My Mother'') about staging operas in Los Angeles in the next few years. John Williams, one of Hollywood's leading composers and a former conductor of the Boston Pops, will create an opera for the company, Mr. Domingo said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domingo has already begun a major fund-raising effort with ''Domingo's Angels,'' contributors and foundations pledging a total of $1 million over four years to support the projects. The relatively new company has yet to fully establish its reputation.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Domingo said he was not especially concerned that the Los Angeles Opera would be viewed by traditionalists as going Hollywood. ''You see so many 'Rings' today,'' he said. ''You realize there are many great 'Rings.' The traditional ones. I particularly love 'The Ring' at the Met. It's traditional. It's extraordinary. But why not create a 'Ring' that's different?''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Everyone's always trying different things with 'The Ring.' It doesn't have any less power in the music and the singing. Powerful music is powerful music.''</p>
        <p>As to working in Califronia, he said: ''Why not use the talent that's here? Use the world of cinema. We very much want to collaborate with the world of Hollywood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Domingo, who presented the company's new principal conductor, Kent Nagano, at a news conference this morning, also announced collaborations with the Kirov Opera and Ballet and its conductor, Valery Gergiev, to work on co-productions of works like Prokofiev's ''Love of Three Oranges,'' which will be staged in the 2004-05 season, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the composer's death.</p>
        <p>''We will always be looking for new elements,'' said Mr. Domingo. ''But we don't want to just drop a famous name to use them. We don't want that. We want to use a director because we believe in them and their sensibility and the possibilities that they will bring to the L.A. Opera.''</p>
