        <p>If there is a way for Nassau County to avoid a state takeover of its finances, the outlines may begin to take shape Tuesday when the man who Gov. George E. Pataki selected to help rescue the county's finances is to meet with Republican and Democratic officials.</p>
        <p>Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, known as NIFA, is scheduled to hold a closed-door meeting with the Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, and the leaders of both parties in the County Legislature. Three days later, on Friday, Mr. Gulotta is required to present his 2001 budget and a four-year budget plan, which NIFA will rule on.</p>
        <p>But the meeting comes after a dispiriting week in which Mr. Gulotta's drafts of budget plans were  roundly dismissed by leaders of both parties.</p>
        <p>The draft budget plans Mr. Gulotta presented last week triggered anger among officials who said the plans were short on details and did not provide a balanced budget. His proposal projected a $207 million deficit for 2004, and a nearly $337 million cumulative deficit by the end of that year.</p>
        <p>A meeting Mr. Gulotta held with officials before the weekend only led to more questions, and Nassau and state officials say the county is running out of time to come up with a budget plan that would ward off a state takeover.</p>
        <p>''Every time that a deadline is not met,'' said Darren Bloch, chief of staff to the Democratic legislative majority, ''and every time we get closer to the moment when a budget is due, it puts more pressure on elected county officials to resolve the situation. And it puts more pressure on NIFA to look more critically on the actions of elected officials.''</p>
        <p>The governor took the step of pledging more than $100 million in state aid to Nassau County in May  after years of unbalanced budgeting left the county spending more money than it took in, even during this current period of sustained economic prosperity. To get the aid, though, the county agreed to come up with a total of $70 million in budget cuts and new revenues in both 2001 and 2002 and $80 million in 2003.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's draft 2001 budget plan seeks to raise property taxes by 4 percent, or $33 per household, and to lay off more than 350 county employees. Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat and the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said she is concerned that the layoffs are too Draconian a measure. Peter J. Schmitt, a Republican and the minority leader, said taxes should be cut only after other measures, like freezing the salaries of county employees, are put in place.</p>
        <p>Both said they stand ready to do what is necessary to solve the problems. But outside observers wondered whether some of Nassau's leaders were quietly hoping for a state takeover to make the politically unpalatable steps necessary to solve Nassau's stubborn fiscal crisis.</p>
        <p>''Maybe, in point of fact, they need the takeover.'' said David Lieb schutz, an adjunct professor at Rockefeller College of Public Affairs and Policy, at the State University at Albany. ''Maybe it has gotten to the point now where the sides are so entrenched in ways to save face that there is no other way than getting a state control board.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said she was prepared to tell Mr. Zarb on Tuesday that her caucus needs much more information from Mr. Gulotta on items like his proposed double-digit raises for county police and correction officers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's plan ''contains many items that concern us and leave us at this point unable to reach any consensus with him,'' she said, ''and I am almost insulted that a budget proposal be put forward without the proper documentation to support it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmitt, in a memo to Richard Luke, executive director of NIFA, said he could not make a value judgment on certain items in Mr. Gulotta's draft plans either.</p>
        <p>''We need his plan, his vision, his direction to take this county,'' Mr. Schmitt said in an interview. ''We're still waiting.''</p>
        <p>But Dianne Baumert-Moyik, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gulotta, said the legislators have proposed ''not a single initiative'' toward fixing the budget.</p>
        <p>''I think there is a frustration on the part of the county executive that the Legislature continues to lob grenades, yet they are responsible for some of the issues,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Many said the whole thing could erupt and leave only one option: a control board.</p>
        <p>''We are getting real close,'' said one person involved in the budget discussions. ''There is momentum for a control board, and how do you break that? The purpose of the meeting will be, how do you stop the forward momentum toward a control board?''</p>
