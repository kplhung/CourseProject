        <p>Your report about the degree to which members of the Clinton cabinet are taking part in Vice President Al Gore's campaign (''Gore Gets Powerful Help From Cabinet,'' Sept. 8) lists several factors that may be responsible, including President Clinton's investment in getting Mr. Gore elected and Mr. Gore's need to have ''marquee names'' vouch for his participation in making important decisions.</p>

        <p>But a more compelling reason for their involvement may be simply that these knowledgeable people regard Gov. George W. Bush's positions on issues like abortion, the environment, tax cuts, Medicare and Social Security as dangerous. The cabinet members may be working hard for Mr. Gore simply because they believe his election would be in the best interests of the country.</p>
