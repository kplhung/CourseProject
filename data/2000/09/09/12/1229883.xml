        <p>GHOSTWRITTEN  By David Mitchell  426 pages. Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>How to describe David Mitchell's first novel, ''Ghostwritten''? You could say the book resembles a musical composition for multiple instruments whose parts converge around a single theme. You could say it blends the nonlinear techniques of movies like Quentin Tarantino's ''Pulp Fiction'' and Krzysztof Kieslowski's ''Red'' with the narrative strategies of Alex Garland's 1999 novel, ''The Tesseract.''</p>
        <p>More simply, you could say that ''Ghostwritten'' relates the intersecting stories of a dozen people all connected to one another by six (or fewer) degrees of separation. Those individuals -- who tell us their stories directly in looping, stream-of-consciousness monologues -- include a member of the Japanese cult responsible for a deadly nerve-gas attack in a Tokyo subway, an Irish physicist on the run from the C.I.A., a late-night radio talk show host in New York City, a courtesan turned art thief in St. Petersburg, a lovesick slacker who works in a used-record store in Tokyo and an old woman who runs a tea and noodle stand in a remote area of China.</p>

You could say it blends the nonlinear techniques of movies like Quentin Tarantino's ''Pulp Fiction'' and Krzysztof Kieslowski's ''Red'' with the narrative strategies of Alex Garland's 1999 novel, ''The Tesseract.''</p>
        <p>More simply, you could say that ''Ghostwritten'' relates the intersecting stories of a dozen people all connected to one another by six (or fewer) degrees of separation. Those individuals -- who tell us their stories directly in looping, stream-of-consciousness monologues -- include a member of the Japanese cult responsible for a deadly nerve-gas attack in a Tokyo subway, an Irish physicist on the run from the C.I.A., a late-night radio talk show host in New York City, a courtesan turned art thief in St. Petersburg, a lovesick slacker who works in a used-record store in Tokyo and an old woman who runs a tea and noodle stand in a remote area of China.</p>
        <p>Though this concept of crisscrossing parallel lives seems like an intriguing postmodern formula for examining the randomness of life in today's global village, Mr. Mitchell is only partly successful in pulling it off. Some of his narrators showcase his remarkable talents as a ventriloquist, but others sound like phony talent-contest impersonations. His aging nymphomaniac in St. Petersburg seems more British or American than Russian; and his Chinese tea-stand owner comes across as a paper-doll composite: we are actually asked to believe that this woman has witnessed all the vicissitudes of Maoist and post-Mao history from her isolated mountainside vista.</p>
        <p>Worse, the addition of another voice, meant to represent that of a disembodied spirit who can move from host to host, century to century, continent to continent, glosses the entire story with a pompous, New Agey tone. Instead of lending credibility to the novel's apocalyptic ending, this voice undermines it, suggesting that all that has transpired in the story thus far is part of an elaborate Shirley MacLaine-esque fantasy, or perhaps a coy authorial joke.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Mitchell stays away from the philosophical mumbo jumbo and sticks more closely to the here and now, he is decidedly more successful. His portrait of a Tokyo teenager named Satoru who works part time in a record shop and falls in love with a pretty customer is finely observed: tender without being sentimental, funny without being snide. Equally convincing is his depiction of a London musician named Marco, who is heavily in debt.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell proves just as adept at limning less ordinary lives as well. In one chapter he takes a Hong Kong trader involved in dubious financial manipulations -- reminiscent, in some respects, of Nicholas W. Leeson, who made headlines in 1995 for his role in the collapse of Britain's oldest investment bank -- and makes his state of mind entirely palpable.</p>
        <p>In another chapter he does the same for a world-renowned physicist named Mo, who has returned home to visit her husband and son on a remote island off the coast of Ireland. Though her plight -- hiding out from her former employers and mysterious American agents intent on persuading her to help develop some sort of Star Wars missile defense -- is ludicrous in outline, it is made frighteningly real, thanks to Mr. Mitchell's attention to emotional detail and his ease in conjuring up the disparate worlds (in Ireland, Hong Kong and Switzerland) that Mo has traversed in the course of her career.</p>
        <p>These characters' lives are tied together through shared motifs that recur, like musical refrains, throughout the book. Jazz tunes weave in and out of many of the chapters, and an assortment of ghosts inhabit the subplots. In one case it's a real ghost who haunts a Hong Kong apartment; in another it's a ghostly, Jamesian doppelganger who haunts an aging man's reminiscences. One character works as a ghostwriter; another has a strange encounter with a ghostly voice from outer space.</p>
        <p>In addition to these leitmotifs, Mr. Mitchell orchestrates chance encounters between his characters that tangentially link his multiple story lines together. Satoru, the Japanese teenager, receives a mysterious phone call -- probably a wrong number -- from the cult member responsible for the gas attack in the Tokyo subway, and Satoru later crosses paths in Hong Kong with the renegade trader whose financial schemes are coming unraveled.</p>
        <p>One of the Russian tart's accomplices in an art theft scheme turns out to be friends with the former British Intelligence officer whose story is being ghostwritten by Marco, the sometime musician and womanizer who just happens to have an affair with the Hong Kong trader's estranged wife and who happens, as well, to save the Irish physicist from being run over by a taxi.</p>
        <p>These glancing meetings are not as contrived as they sound; rather, as rendered by Mr. Mitchell, they serve to illustrate the strange interconnectivity of the modern world and the improvisatory nature of fate. It is when Mr. Mitchell tries to explain these random events with portentous allusions to ghosts and never-dying spirits that his otherwise gripping and innovative novel stumbles into the realm of the hokey.</p>
