        <p>Dr Howard Waksman letter on Dr Sandeep Jauhar's Sept 5 article defends approach of teaching hospitals</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his discussion of the patient with sleep-disordered breathing, lethargy and delirium (''Teaching Hospitals Too Busy for Curiosity,'' Sept. 5), Dr. Sandeep Jauhar transfers the ''sicker and quicker'' criticism of hospital care to include its effects on resident-training programs. He feels that we have reduced much of medicine to a ''cookbook'' approach that is incompatible with creative and insightful approaches to medical care.</p>
        <p>He mistakes the protocols for cookbooks, when in fact, they are part of an attempt to treat based on evidence rather than personal experience. The protocols are not meant to be unchanging; rather they are an expression of the current state of medical knowledge and are to be questioned at every turn and revised when they are outmoded.</p>

        <p>I do agree that there is pressure on faculty to produce not just academically, but financially, and that the educational experience suffers.  On the other hand, whose fault is it that residents don't bother to look at their X-rays and tests, relying more on a report?</p>
