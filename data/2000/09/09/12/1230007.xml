        <p>Albania has become the 138th member of the World Trade Organization, eight years after it applied to join. Mike Moore, director of the Geneva-based global trade group, said the accession of the formerly Communist-ruled country means the W.T.O. can ''help foster greater peace, stability and development in southeastern Europe.'' Albania was one of the last redoubts of orthodox Communism until 1992, when it was transformed by elections and free-market economic changes. But Albania remains one of the smallest and weakest countries in the region, hurt by years of isolation and proximity to the armed conflicts in the Balkans.</p>
