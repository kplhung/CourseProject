        <p>If there is one look that won't be hitting the runways during the spring 2001 collections in New York, which begin on Thursday and run through Sept. 22, it's that of the exaggeratedly thin models who reached a kind of apogee (or nadir, depending on your viewpoint) during the eras of heroin chic, grunge and the waif. Fashionable standards of beauty fluctuate -- within a narrow range -- but among the largely unremarked, and salutary, changes in the modeling business, insiders say, is a renewed appetite for women who do not look fundamentally ill.</p>
        <p>''The one thing everyone is looking for is a more natural, sexier look,'' said Annie Veltri, president of T Management, the year-old model agency owned by Donald Trump. ''There are curves again and there are bodies.''</p>

        <p>If there is one look that won't be hitting the runways during the spring 2001 collections in New York, which begin on Thursday and run through Sept. 22, it's that of the exaggeratedly thin models who reached a kind of apogee (or nadir, depending on your viewpoint) during the eras of heroin chic, grunge and the waif. Fashionable standards of beauty fluctuate -- within a narrow range -- but among the largely unremarked, and salutary, changes in the modeling business, insiders say, is a renewed appetite for women who do not look fundamentally ill.</p>
        <p>''The one thing everyone is looking for is a more natural, sexier look,'' said Annie Veltri, president of T Management, the year-old model agency owned by Donald Trump. ''There are curves again and there are bodies.''</p>
        <p>Credit Gisele Bundchen and her fellow Brazilians -- that amazing influx of beautiful cynosures who captivated the United States with their ripe, often biracial features and with their authentic (well, most of the time) bosoms and hips. And don't discount the effects of the first Body Image Summit, a meeting convened this June in London by European editors and the British Medical Association to consider the relationship between the largely unrealistic images of women's bodies represented by most fashion models and an escalation of eating disorders in Britain.</p>
        <p>In the last 20 years, styles in models have caromed from prom queens (Christie Brinkley) to blank-eyed androgynes (Kate Moss), from surgically enhanced supermodels (let's not say) to anonymous nobodies, from athletic all-Americans (Nikki Taylor) to gorgeous slackers who wear septum rings when they're not in front of the camera (Sybil Buck).</p>
        <p>As with other aspects of fashion, the preferred look among models is subject to influences as fluky as the economy, politics and editorial diktat. So variable are these forces that people in the modeling business not infrequently refer to models as having expiration, or ''use by,'' dates. ''In our industry people are always looking for a change,'' Ms. Veltri said. The particulars of the group desire aren't often articulated, she added, although ''you know it when you see it.''</p>
        <p>From the supply side, the consensus on the coming season's models is that the Brazilians are not a phase, and that ''health'' is so ubiquitous a buzzword you couldn't give a waif away. ''I want girls who, when they walk into a go-see, you can tell they're models,'' said Bob Dean, who books runway models for the Click agency. ''They have to look very clean, very fresh, very natural, and with a presence, of course.''</p>
        <p>Following what Ashton Hundley, a Ford agent, called the ''supermodel sexy moment'' of the mid-90's, there came an interesting and less traditionally sexy time, essentially the era of Kate Moss. Now, Mr. Hundley said, the look is ''a little more diverse and much more natural.''</p>
        <p>And what precisely does ''natural'' mean in this context? ''If you could equate Gisele's success to the trend of the 80's, where everyone looked like they'd had surgery, you can see the difference,'' Mr. Hundley said.</p>
        <p>In former times, it was no impediment to bookings that a model's looks were achieved with the help of starvation, silicon and a scalpel. ''It didn't matter if she bought her nose and breasts,'' Mr. Hundley said; there was status in the fact that ''a model had big new door-knocker Versace earrings and a new face.''</p>
        <p>Gisele Bundchen, for one, would probably have been working successfully in those days, he added -- ''but with a different nose.''</p>
