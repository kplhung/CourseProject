        <p>The criminal investigation and prosecution of Wen Ho Lee, which largely collapsed last weekend with his agreement to plead guilty to a single felony count, must be reviewed by an independent examiner to determine if racial profiling or other unfair tactics were used by the government.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee had planned to plead guilty to improperly downloading classified defense documents at the Los Alamos laboratory. But the plea hearing has been postponed until tomorrow. Federal prosecutors are expected to drop the 58 other counts against him, allowing him to go free. The remaining count does not indicate any intent to harm the United States or assist a foreign nation, the central claim the government initially sought to prove.</p>
        <p>This would be a stunning turnabout for government officials who previously insisted that the downloaded data contained the ''crown jewels'' of America's nuclear arsenal that could change the global balance of power if transferred to a hostile nation. In recent weeks these assertions were undermined by  new information. The lead agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation admitted in court to having testified falsely. Several top nuclear scientists testified that the vast majority of the information was already in the public domain. The data was not classified as secret or even confidential until after Mr. Lee was fired from Los Alamos last year.</p>
        <p>As the case came unglued under the prodding of Judge James A. Parker, evidence has mounted that Mr. Lee was singled out because of his Chinese ancestry. Robert Vrooman, former head of counterintelligence at Los Alamos, and Charles Washington, former acting head of counterintelligence at the Energy Department, submitted affidavits saying that Mr. Lee had been targeted as a suspect because of his background. Mr. Washington said that others suspected of serious security violations had escaped prosecution, and that many had merely been ''verbally counseled'' for mishandling classified data.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker ordered the government to turn over for his review thousands of pages of documents this week, including classified material compiled by the Energy Department on racial profiling tactics and State Department records on individuals who breached national security but were not prosecuted. In ending the case, the government would conveniently avoid those disclosures.</p>
        <p>But Congress and the public should not be satisfied with this resolution. President Clinton should appoint a politically independent person of national standing to review the entire case. The nation deserves to know if national security secrets were ever compromised at Los Alamos, and whether the government unfairly singled out Dr. Lee and other Chinese-Americans for investigation. If racial profiling is found, investigators and prosecutors should be called to account for their conduct.</p>
