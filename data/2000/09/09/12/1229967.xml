        <p>My wife was buying groceries at the Giant supermarket shortly after Al Gore chose Joe Lieberman as his running mate. It was a Friday, and as the checkout lady bagged my wife's groceries, she was left at the end with two breads -- one a Sabbath challah and the other a Roman Meal sandwich loaf. The checkout lady picked up the two breads, put them in a bag together, looked at my wife with a little smile and said: ''I think the Roman Meal and challah can go together, don't you?''</p>
        <p>My wife told me she was sure it was the grocery lady's little commentary on the Gore-Lieberman ticket. I tell that story when people ask if I think Americans will actually vote for a ticket with a Jewish vice-presidential candidate. Sure, for some Mr. Lieberman's religion will be a negative, but I have no doubt most Americans will judge him on his merits, which thus far have only elevated his popularity.</p>

        <p>My wife was buying groceries at the Giant supermarket shortly after Al Gore chose Joe Lieberman as his running mate. It was a Friday, and as the checkout lady bagged my wife's groceries, she was left at the end with two breads -- one a Sabbath challah and the other a Roman Meal sandwich loaf. The checkout lady picked up the two breads, put them in a bag together, looked at my wife with a little smile and said: ''I think the Roman Meal and challah can go together, don't you?''</p>
        <p>My wife told me she was sure it was the grocery lady's little commentary on the Gore-Lieberman ticket. I tell that story when people ask if I think Americans will actually vote for a ticket with a Jewish vice-presidential candidate. Sure, for some Mr. Lieberman's religion will be a negative, but I have no doubt most Americans will judge him on his merits, which thus far have only elevated his popularity.</p>
        <p>It's become something of a truism in American politics that, to paraphrase H. L. Mencken, you'll never go broke underestimating the American people. I think just the opposite is true. It certainly has been in this campaign. There is still a basic fairness and intelligence to the American electorate, and both candidates have gotten into their worst trouble when they underestimated that.</p>
        <p>Consider Gov. George W. Bush's lengthy dodging of the official presidential debates. Mr. Bush had a complicated explanation about how it was really Mr. Gore who was dodging the debates, because he wouldn't go on ''Larry King'' or ''Meet the Press'' first. But that didn't fly. Eskimos in their igloos in Alaska could see that Mr. Bush was running away. Australian aborigines tuning in by satellite could tell that Mr. Bush was dodging Mr. Gore. That's why, when you listened to Mr. Bush accusing Mr. Gore of avoiding the debates, you just wanted to say: ''Am I wearing a sign that says 'Stupid' on it?'' A politician should never put such a question on voters' lips. Mr. Bush seems to have gotten the message.</p>
        <p>Al Gore's low point -- the moment that deflated his whole primary campaign -- was when he declared that he believed that the Cuban refugee Elian Gonzalez should not automatically be reunited with his father, but that the case should be resolved in family court -- and that none of this had to do with Florida politics. People are always ready to accept a certain amount of pandering, but they resent it when it goes to a point of insulting their intelligence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's recent rebound surely has to do with the fact that, having long underestimated voters by appealing to them with various disguises and Alpha Male routines, he finally settled on running as, well, Al Gore. His convention speech basically said: I'm a wonk, I'm a bore, but I love my wife, I believe in government, and I know from experience in Washington how to make things work at home and abroad. That was a person a lot more people thought they might like as president. And on the question of his association with Mr. Clinton's scandals, Mr. Gore declared: Don't worry, I'm my own man.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, by contrast, has run as himself from the start. And while aspects of his personality are clearly appealing to voters, his inability to consistently put sentences together -- and the holes in his knowledge that lead him to calling Greeks ''Grecians'' and to other eyebrow-raising bloopers -- have forced him to essentially say to voters: Don't worry, I won't be my own man.</p>
        <p>For instance, last week Mr. Bush introduced Colin Powell at a campaign event by saying: ''The next man I introduce used to be in government. And if all goes well . . . [he will be in my cabinet too].'' Message to voters: Don't worry, I won't be driving alone. Powell will be there in the front seat, along with dad's other old advisers. But this may not be a bad strategy, because it addresses what voters worry about with Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>For many voters this election is clearly about differing policies, but for many I believe it's about something more basic -- a feeling that the country's engine is running O.K., and we're more or less headed on the right road, and therefore the key question is, to whom do you want to entrust the car keys? That's a question the American people come to with a lot of good instincts -- whether in evaluating character or tax cuts. And my own bet is that in these closing weeks of the campaign the candidate who loses will be the one who underestimates that.</p>
