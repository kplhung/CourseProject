        <p>AUSTRIA: SANCTIONS DECISION DUE  A decision on whether European Union partners will lift diplomatic sanctions against Austria is expected soon, according to France's European affairs minister, Pierre Moscovici. A European Commission panel said last week that continuing the sanctions would be counterproductive.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: KOHL BACK TO POLITICS  After a 10-month absence, former Chancellor Helmut Kohl returned to a regular strategy session of his Christian Democratic Party's parliamentary group. Mr. Kohl, who retained his seat in Parliament after being ousted as chancellor in 1998, skipped all meetings after admitting last year that he had accepted illegal campaign donations. At the session in the Reichstag building, two colleagues began clapping when he appeared, but quickly stopped when no one joined in.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: LAND MINE CAMPAIGN  The global campaign to ban land mines is urging governments to take steps to pressure or isolate countries that have yet to sign the 1997 treaty banning the devices. Campaigners have been urging NATO members to refuse to take part in military actions involving use of land mines, and so far France and the Netherlands have indicated a willingness to do so. Delegates from 138 countries that have signed the pact are meeting in Geneva.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: I.M.F. PROTEST  Small groups of students protesting the policies of the International Monetary Fund were detained by the police in Istanbul and the southern city of Adana. At the urging of the I.M.F., Turkey has been taking tough measures to cut inflation, and the possibility of harsher steps arose over the weekend. About 50 protesters were stopped as they approached the American Consulate in Istanbul.</p>

        <p>GREECE: BID TO BAR LESBIANS  A mayor on Lesbos has asked a district court to bar entry to 100 British lesbians, saying their tour operator falsely advertised his town as ''a paradise of gay love.'' Mayor Polydoras Abatzis said the operator had damaged the reputation of Eressos, the legendary birthplace of Sappho. A ruling is expected today.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: NEW ABDUCTIONS, RAPE REPORTS  Armed gunmen kidnapped three people from a Malaysian diving resort and took them to the southern Philippines, where Muslim rebels are holding 19 people, including an American, Jeffrey Schilling, 24. Meanwhile, one of the four European hostages freed last weekend said that some of the female hostages released earlier had been raped by the rebels. He said the male hostages were unable to defend them.</p>

        <p>BURUNDI: TUTSI PARTY SIGNS PACT  One of four holdout Tutsi political parties signed a power-sharing pact with the Hutu majority, two days before the deadline for joining a peace plan intended to end the country's seven-year civil war. The Social Democratic Party, citing last-minute changes, refused to sign the accord on Aug. 28 in Arusha, Tanzania, in the presence of international leaders including President Clinton.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: HEALTH SPENDING  With elections expected by next spring, Prime Minister Jean Chretien offered to increase federal health spending transfers to provinces by 25 percent, or $15 billion, over the next five years. After heavy cuts in the late 1990's, Canadians now tell pollsters health care is their No. 1 concern. With a large surplus this year, Mr. Chretien would have a hard time winning an election without restoring funding to the national health system.</p>

        <p>CANADA: RIGHTIST GAINS SEEN  The leaders of Canada's two right-wing parties faced voters in special elections expected to strengthen the voice of conservatives when Parliament reconvenes on Sept. 18. Stockwell Day, leader of the Canadian Alliance, is expected to win easily in British Columbia. Joe Clark, the Tories' leader, is also expected to win in Nova Scotia.</p>

        <p>BARBADOS: STEMMING AIDS  Faced with the highest incidence of AIDS and H.I.V. infection outside sub-Saharan Africa, members of the Caribbean Community are meeting in Barbados for two days to try to develop a regional response to the disease. While Haiti and the Dominican Republic account for 85 percent of the H.I.V. and AIDS cases in the Caribbean, the virus is spreading in other countries.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: PROTESTERS JAILED  A court sentenced 24 people to prison terms of up to five years for their role in two days of rioting that erupted after elections in February, the official news agency said. The 24 were held in Khalkhal after the conservative Guardians Council annulled the results of the northwest town's vote, taking away the seat from the winning pro-reform candidate and gaving it to his conservative opponent.</p>
