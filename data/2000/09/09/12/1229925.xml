        <p>In an effort to fuse entertainment, education and artificial intelligence, a company in Newton, Mass., is starting a Web site of interactive cartoon characters imbued with behavior that mimics human emotion.</p>
        <p>The company, Zoesis Studios, is seeking to eventually create a new medium of interactive entertainment parallel to television.</p>
        <p>Zoesis was founded in 1996 by Joseph Bates, a Carnegie Mellon University computer scientist who develops interactive dramas, an area of artificial intelligence research that tries to create fantasy worlds and characters with whom humans can interact.</p>
        <p>The site, www.thelivingletters .com, is scheduled to go online today.</p>
        <p>The service, which will be offered free and can be accessed with a Windows-based personal computer, will present young Web users with two cartoon-style characters with whom they can interact by using their mouse as a pointer.</p>
        <p>The two characters, Otto and Iris, will exhibit behaviors like fear of the dark, giggling when ''tickled'' by a user's mouse and a variety of facial expressions. The characters can play tag with a computer user in one scene, or sing in response to a user acting as ''conductor'' wielding the mouse as a baton.</p>
        <p>At some time, the company said, a ''villain'' will be created to help build a story line and some tension into the experience.</p>
        <p>Zoesis has initial backing from Fujitsu Ltd., the Japanese consumer electronics giant. Fujitsu has previously financed research on the so-called virtual worlds, which permit users to move around in fantasy worlds, represented by figures known as avatars.</p>
        <p>But the Zoesis project is unrelated to that work. Rather, it is the outgrowth of research that Mr. Bates first did with several other members of the start-up at Carnegie Mellon over the last decade.</p>
        <p>Known as the Oz Project, the research tried to use artificial intelligence techniques to create a new medium by blending characters, presentation and drama.</p>
        <p>''This is broadly an extension that was started in the 1980's on behavior-based robots,'' Mr. Bates said.</p>
        <p>The group has worked at creating software ''agents'' whose behavior appears to be goal-based and who can even be imbued with emotional qualities.</p>
        <p>Researchers at other academic centers like the M.I.T. Media Laboratory and Stanford University have long worked on similar projects.</p>
        <p>Barbara Hayes-Roth, a Stanford artificial intelligence researcher, has also founded a company, Extempo Systems Inc., to develop interactive software agents. Extempo has developed its agents for Internet customer service applications, in which, for instance, a character might answer questions from computer users.</p>
        <p>Some social scientists and industry executives say that interactive drama has the potential to replace the television sitcom as an entertainment medium.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bates said he believed that such a transition was possible, but he was not certain how quickly the interactive entertainment medium might evolve.</p>
        <p>''It's not clear what will make this more compelling than sitcoms,'' he said, ''but certainly if you have character and story you're in the right ballpark.''</p>
