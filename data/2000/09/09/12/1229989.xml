        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about stickball (Weekend section, Sept. 8) reminded me of the more basic version of the game, punchball.</p>
        <p>As a Brooklyn teenager, I took part in many of these games, usually played on Pulaski Street, between Throop and Tompkins Avenues. A manhole in the center of the street was designated as home, and the next manhole was second base, with first base and third base chalk-marked against the curb.</p>
        <p>The batter tossed a ''spaldeen'' rubber ball into the air, and either punched or slapped the ball downfield, putting it into play. An average ''one sewer'' hitter could either punch or slap the ball as far as the next manhole; a ''two sewer'' hitter could hit the ball as far as the second manhole from home plate.</p>
        <p>With the cheering Sunday morning audience lining the curb, it was as exciting to us as baseball.</p>
        <p>SEYMOUR BECKER  Brooklyn, Sept. 8, 2000</p>
