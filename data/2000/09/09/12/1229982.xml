        <p>By the time George Scott abandoned work, jumped into his car and steered it to the Shell station on the Old Brompton Road, most of the gasoline pumps were already festooned with ''Not in Service'' signs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scott, a 50-year-old interior designer, was under no illusions about his motive, or his mood. ''I'm panic-buying,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He was lucky to find fuel at all. More than 1,000 gasoline stations across Britain were forced to close today as groups of protesters, furious at high fuel prices, blockaded oil refineries, cutting off fuel deliveries and sending consumers rushing to the pumps in a mad race to fill their cars before the gasoline ran out.</p>
        <p>The protests -- by truck drivers, farm workers and taxi drivers -- were echoed by similar demonstrations in Belgium, where truck drivers paralyzed the center of Brussels.</p>
        <p>That irate mood was sweeping across Europe. Groups in Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Germany, emboldened by the success of French protests last week -- which resulted in the government's decision to lower fuel taxes by 15 percent -- mounted or prepared to mount their own actions.</p>
        <p>The rising cost of gasoline is a huge irritant to consumers, and a serious threat to some industries in Europe, where enormous government taxes have resulted in gasoline prices that can be more than twice as high as those in the United States.</p>
        <p>But prices in Britain are the highest of all. The current price of premium fuel is about $4.37 a gallon, of which 76.2 percent goes to taxes.</p>
        <p>''It's a wonder anybody can afford to drive in this country,'' said Mark Ostron, 45, who had his gas-buying hopes dashed at the Old Brompton Shell station this afternoon when it became apparent that there was no more super unleaded. Normally, he said, it costs him about 55 pounds -- or $83 -- to fill up his Ford Escort.</p>
        <p>The consumer anger has presented Prime Minister Tony Blair with an unpleasant political problem.  Today's events brought unhappy memories of the dark days of 1973, when fuel was rationed and there were endless waits at gas stations. The Conservative government lost the next election.</p>
        <p>But today Mr. Blair said he was determined not to capitulate to public pressure by lowering the fuel tax.</p>
        <p>''We cannot and will not alter government policy on petrol through blockades and pickets,'' he said, speaking at a conference on e-commerce in Loughborough, central England. ''That's not the way to make policy in Britain.''</p>
        <p>The prime minister also denied rumors that Britain's fuel supplies were in danger of running out. ''The sensible way, the only way, to deal with this problem is to put pressure on OPEC,'' he said. Still, the government did invoke special powers, dating from 1976, to ensure that supplies of fuel are distributed. It did not detail exactly what it would do, however.</p>
        <p>The protests have been varied. In the center of Liverpool, taxis choked traffic circles and key roads. On some highways, deliberate slowdowns by truck drivers resulted in mass delays. Blockades by haulers ground deliveries to a halt, or severely curtailed them, at refineries.</p>
        <p>Gasoline was rationed -- $15.50 worth per customer -- in parts of Wales and the Midlands. In some areas of the country, ambulances were told to keep to a 55 miles-per-hour speed limit.</p>
        <p>By tonight, the Petrol Retailers' Association was estimating that 2,000 British gas stations had already run out of fuel or were about to do so. Texaco reported that a third of its stations had shut down. And in Leeds, suppliers warned that the city's pumps could be dry by morning.</p>
        <p>''Until now, this demonstration has been carried out by haulers and people in the agricultural sector,'' said Roy Holloway, director of the fuel retailers' group. ''But this could swing the motorists behind these two groups and give the government a serious problem indeed.''</p>
        <p>At a Shell station in London, Amanda Brownell was not worried about traffic slowdowns or protests.  She was worried about getting some gasoline for her Vauxhall Tigra, whose gauge was on empty. And the unleaded fuel pumps were empty.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brownell, 30, an Internet designer, said, ''There's only one other petrol station near here, and I don't think I'm going to make it.''</p>
