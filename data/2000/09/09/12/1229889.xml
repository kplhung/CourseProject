        <p>After more than five years of concerns and planning, the first of a new set of cases to protect the original United States Constitution and other key national documents is ready to replace older encasements that have begun to break down.</p>
        <p>Engineers with the federal government and private contractors have built the first of new airtight enclosures that they say should preserve the founding documents of the nation for more than 100 years and help make them easier for people to view.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the National Archives and Records Administration will let the public see one of the new cases for the first time. The rarely seen second page of the Constitution will go on display for three days behind the laminated tempered glass of its up-to-date titanium and aluminum enclosure.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the original page will go back into a vault and an early model of the case containing a facsimile of the Bill of Rights will anchor an exhibit on efforts to preserve the documents over the years.</p>
        <p>All six pages of the foundation documents of the country, known as the Charters of Freedom, will be in new encasements when the rotunda of the National Archives building, where they are displayed, reopens in 2003 after extensive renovations. The rotunda, one of Washington's most popular tourist attractions, will close on July 5, 2001, for reconstruction that will make the documents more accessible to the handicapped and other improvements.</p>
        <p>The Charter documents are the original parchment sheets on which are written the Declaration of Independence, the four pages of the United States Constitution and its first 10 amendments, known as the Bill of Rights. George Washington's transmittal letter for the Constitution will also be re-encased in one of the new enclosures.</p>
        <p>''The Charters of Freedom are the primary records of the nation, the underpinnings of our society,'' said John W. Carlin, archivist of the United States and head of the archives administration. ''We are going to do everything we can to preserve them while keeping them accessible to the people.''</p>
        <p>The new encasements, which look like large, deep picture frames, are to replace smaller ones made in 1952 by what was then the National Bureau of Standards. The new cases are being made and tested by the bureau's successor agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, known as NIST.</p>
        <p>More than five years ago, keepers of the documents began noticing subtle changes in the old, bronze-framed enclosures, which hinted that the glass was beginning to deteriorate. Under special lighting, a haziness was noticed in areas of inner panes of glass that touched parts of the Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence. Conservators also noticed tiny white flakes in some enclosures, possible evidence of unwanted chemical reactions caused by air and excessive moisture.</p>
        <p>Outside experts commissioned by the Archives concluded that there was no immediate danger to the documents, but recommended looking into new enclosures.</p>
        <p>The old enclosures are a sandwich of three panes of glass supported by bronze brackets and sealed with lead strips, with the entire assembly then placed in an outer bronze frame. The document rests on a sheet of pure cellulose backing paper covering the back glass pane. A thin glass cover lies atop the parchment to hold it flat. There is an empty space above this inner pane and a top sheet of glass in front. The middle glass sheet touching the parchment is the major concern with the old case, experts said.</p>
        <p>Engineers pumped air out of the enclosure and filled it with helium, an inert gas that displaces oxygen and inhibits chemical reactions, and enough water vapor to produce a relative humidity inside of 25 to 35 percent before sealing it. Parchment, which is stretched and cured animal skin, needs some moisture to keep it from becoming brittle. But too much water can cause the material to swell and can promote the growth of organisms if they are present.</p>
        <p>Richard Judson, an engineer who serves as the Archives's project manager for the new encasements, said preliminary tests of gases from some of the old enclosures indicated that the concerns were warranted. Relative humidity in these cases was found to range from 41.4 percent to 48.5 percent, higher than expected, and oxygen-containing air was found in the containers holding Page 3 of the Constitution and the transmittal page.</p>
        <p>''The seal on the Page 2 enclosure looked fairly good, but the seals on Page 3 and the transmittal page appeared to be leaking,'' Mr. Judson said. ''It looks like we were correct in moving ahead with the new enclosures as soon as we did.''</p>
        <p>Working with more than 20 criteria for the new cases dictated by the Archives, including high visibility for the documents and the ability to open and reseal the cases, engineers produced a working model early last year and spent more than a year refining it into prototypes.</p>
        <p>The standards institute is building nine cases, seven to house the documents and two prototypes that will serve as backups. Two cases will be slightly larger than the others, measuring 39 and one-quarter inches tall, 37 and fifteen-sixteenths inches wide and 3 and one-sixth inches deep, because the Bill of Rights is larger than the other documents. The other cases, sized for the Constitution, will be 33 and five-eighths inches wide, but will share the other dimensions.</p>
        <p>The Archives settled on a case that has a solid aluminum alloy base, with sections milled out of the bottom to reduce weight, giving it a honeycomb appearance. A channel that goes around the front edge of the base contains a tin-coated metal seal ring which compresses when the case is tightened to create an airtight seal with upper layers.</p>
        <p>Covering the enclosure and sitting atop the base is a two-layer, three-eighths-of-an-inch-thick sheet of laminated, tempered glass that is bonded with a layer of plastic to resist shattering. The enclosure is bolted to a titanium metal frame that clamps the glass against the seal ring.</p>
        <p>For aesthetic reasons, the gray-colored titanium is nickel-plated to bond an outer coating of 24-carat gold. Inside each enclosure is a thin, perforated aluminum document platform that stands about an inch high on three, snap-out posts. This platform is detachable so that it and the attached document can be removed from the enclosure if disassembled.</p>
        <p>The document is to rest on pieces of pure cellulose paper specially made at the University of Iowa, and both will be affixed to the platform with thin clips of clear polyester film that exert almost no pressure. Each piece of parchment has irregular, unique edges and both the platform and paper for each document will be cut in its shape so as not to be visible beneath.</p>
        <p>There have been a number of design changes in the enclosures since the first engineering model was completed last year, Mr. Judson said. For instance, engineers reduced the number of bolts to 70 from 80. They also added two covered instrument bays in the base, he said, one for valves used to fill and purge the cases with gases and the other for humidity and temperature sensors.</p>
        <p>The cases will be filled with inert argon gas instead of the helium used in the earlier enclosures because argon is a larger molecule that is less likely to escape. And conservators decided to keep the relative humidity inside the new cases at 40 percent, higher than planned for the earlier containers, to more closely match outside conditions in the event the enclosures must be opened.</p>
        <p>To help check conditions inside the enclosures if internal sensors fail, engineers decided to install an external monitoring system that measures water vapor and oxygen content based upon changes in the wavelengths of a special light beamed into the case. This required putting two small optical windows, each covered with a sapphire lens, in the base of the enclosure and a set of three mirrors in a box beneath the document platform inside the case.</p>
        <p>With this system, developed by Aerodyne Research Incorporated of Billerica, Mass., light from an argon discharge lamp goes into the enclosure, reflects off the mirrors and is measured coming out. Changes in wavelength of this light caused by water vapor or oxygen absorption should help conservators monitor the gaseous environment inside the encasements, said Andrew Freedman, who helped develop the system for Aerodyne.</p>
        <p>Opening the old cases also gives conservators their first chance in five decades to closely examine the documents with modern techniques. As each page comes out of its old case, the Archives staff will remove tiny surface plugs from an edge to study the parchment, said Kitty Nicholson, one of the conservators.</p>
        <p>Researchers will examine the fibers of each document and catalog their individual characteristics and state of deterioration. By comparing the condition of each sample with what is known about other old parchment and unexposed examples in reference collections, conservators will establish a standard of deterioration for each document, Ms. Nicholson said.</p>
        <p>As each document comes out of its enclosure, it is placed on a special vacuum suction table encased in highly humid air, a process that slowly flattens parchment warped by years of changing conditions.</p>
        <p>Starting with Page 2 of the Constitution and its transmittal page, conservators are methodically examining each line of script, which was written with iron-based gall ink that has discolored and grown more brittle with age. Ink flakes seen pulling away from the parchment are being reset in place by putting minuscule drops of a special collagen solution behind them with tiny needles. This ''glue'' is made by cooking gelatin with pieces of new parchment to make a jelly solution full of collagen protein fibers that are found naturally in animal skin, Ms. Nicholson said.</p>
        <p>Mary Lynn Ritzenthaler, another conservator working on the documents, said microscopic examination of the parchments had so far shown no evidence that the deteriorating glass of the old enclosures had marked or otherwise affected the documents. But she said there had been some surprises.</p>
        <p>''We see remnants of original rule lines used to help writers keep their lines straight,'' she said. Conservators also found evidence of insect feeding on the bottom edge of the transmittal page, which occurred at some point before its first encasement.</p>
        <p>Opening the pages also gives conservators their first look at the back sides of each page, which are not well documented. The back of the Constitution's second page revealed a surprise.</p>
        <p>''On the back of Page 2, we see the intimation of a hand print, a very faint impression we didn't know was there before,'' Ms. Ritzenthaler said. ''We have no idea who it might belong to, but it opens things up for a lot of speculation.''</p>
