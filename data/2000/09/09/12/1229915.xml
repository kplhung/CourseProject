        <p>California today enacted the most generous college financial aid plan in the nation, guaranteeing needy high school students with good grades grants for full tuition at the state's public colleges and universities, or nearly $10,000 a year toward tuition at one of the state's private institutions. The plan will cost the state more than $1 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Flush with a $12 billion budget surplus and fighting years of declines in its once proud public education system, California will have by far the largest and most comprehensive aid program for graduating high school seniors. The plan amounts to a new entitlement program that will be nearly twice the size of a similar program in New York, for example, and equal to about one-third of the total spending by all states on student grants and aid combined.</p>
        <p>The proposal passed unanimously in both houses of the Legislature last month, and as he signed it today on the Los Angeles campus of the California State University, Gov. Gray Davis called the occasion ''a historic day for higher education.'' Indeed, the measure sails against the recent trend in scholarship programs, including another signed today by Mr. Davis, that are focused on tax credits or academic performance without regard to financial need. Those programs have tended to help middle-class families most.</p>
        <p>Instead, the so-called Cal-Grants, which represent a vast expansion of a program that has been in place since 1956, blend merit and financial need. Starting Jan. 1, 2001, any high school senior in the state with a B average and a household income of $64,000 or less for a family of four would qualify for free tuition at any public university in the state, or $9,700 toward tuition at a private one. Even C students from families earning less than $34,000 a year would receive $1,500 a year for living costs and books to help them catch up at community colleges and qualify to go on for four-year degrees.</p>
        <p>''What California said today was 'need still matters,' '' said Travis Reindl, a policy analyst at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities in Washington. ''For the last seven years, with the emphasis on accountability in education, the emphasis has been on merit. This says let's look at the need and merit combined.''</p>
        <p>State officials did not hesitate to call the program, which is expected to cover almost one-third of all graduating high school seniors, about 100,000 students a year, an entitlement, akin to Medicare or Social Security, though Mr. Davis, a moderate Democrat and a fiscal conservative, did not use that word. He had proposed a separate measure, also enacted today, that would award $118 million a year in merit scholarships of $1,000 to the top 10 percent of scorers in each high school on a standardized achievement test, and $2,500 to the highest performers on Advanced Placement exams in math and science.</p>
        <p>Legislative critics had said that the separate measure would tend to favor middle-class students, and the governor finally bowed to bipartisan pressure from both houses, which  passed the bills as a package.</p>
        <p>''I want to emphasize,'' Mr. Davis said today, ''these bills are not a free ride. They are a fair reward for extraordinary achievement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis's interim secretary of education, John Mockler, said in an interview, ''The beauty of it is you can say to every kid in high school, 'You do your part and get the grades, and income is not going to be a deterrent to your going to college.' ''</p>
        <p>Before the 1970's, the state offered free tuition for higher education. But it has not had enough money in recent years to offer Cal-Grants to all students whose grades and family incomes would make them eligible. When Mr. Davis took office two years ago, the program was spending about $400 million a year, one-third the amount it will now spend, and last year only about 55,000 of the 137,000 eligible students received aid. Just over half of California's high-school graduates go on to college, compared with the national average of nearly 60 percent.</p>
        <p>Other states have similar programs, including New York's Tuition Assistance Program, which provides about $700 million in annual aid to needy students and was previously the most generous state program, according to Mr. Reindl of the Association of State Colleges and Universities. But its maximum annual grant is $5,000, and it fully covers tuition for only the poorest families.</p>
        <p>''This catapults California into the lead,'' Mr. Reindl said. But he warned that the risk of creating such a new entitlement is that it would face intense pressure in lean budgetary years. ''This is a huge financial commitment,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nani Escudero, 19, and Nicolette Birdsong-Gibson, 24, both juniors at Cal State L.A. who say they could not have afforded tuition without the Cal-Grants, said today that the new program would help them persuade students to apply to college. Both work as interns helping high school students prepare for college.</p>
        <p>''I come on a lot of situations where kids say, 'I don't want to go to college,' '' Ms. Escudero said, ''and I ask why not, and they say, 'I can't afford it.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Birdsong-Gibson added: ''Cost is always the major thing. I know a lot of students with good grades who just don't believe they can afford it. This should really help.''</p>
        <p>John Burton of San Francisco, the Democratic president pro tem of the State Senate, who pressed hard for the measure, said: ''What this says to poor kids in high school is no longer can they say to themselves, 'Why should I study? I ain't going to go anywhere anyway because my family can't afford it.' It's like the G.I. Bill was.''</p>
