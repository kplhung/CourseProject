        <p>For the first time in several centuries, a member of the primate order, the taxonomic group to which human beings belong, has become extinct, scientists say.</p>
        <p>The vanished primate, Miss Waldron's red colobus, was not nearly as charismatic as, say, a chimpanzee or orangutan. Indeed, debate has not yet ended on whether the loud-mouthed, red-cheeked monkey from the rain forest canopy of Ghana and the Ivory Coast deserved full status as a species in its own right or should remain a colobus subspecies.</p>
        <p>But now that debate is moot, a team of experts reports in the October issue of the peer-reviewed journal Conservation Biology.</p>
        <p>And biologists say this is just the beginning of what they foresee as a growing stream of extinctions of West African primates and other wildlife. Fragmentation of forests by logging and road building has created isolated islands of animals that are being systematically trapped and shot by hunters supplying the lucrative trade in bush meat, which is flowing to urban restaurants.</p>
        <p>In the paper, the five authors, led by John F. Oates, an anthropologist from Hunter College in Manhattan, conclude, ''The extinction of Miss Waldron's red colobus may be the first obvious manifestation of an extinction spasm that will soon affect other large animals in this region unless more rigorous protection is applied immediately.''</p>
        <p>For biologists, proposing that something is extinct requires a special level of confidence because no one wants to be the expert who gets it wrong, and this time around, at least according to several scientists familiar with the study, the authors' confidence is justified.</p>
        <p>Ross D. E. MacPhee, an expert on extinction and the curator of mammals at the American Museum of Natural History, said the authors, by carefully monitoring the monkeys' habitat and history over several decades, have created a rare, valuable picture of the evolutionary endgame.</p>
        <p>Extinction is a process, not an event, Dr. MacPhee said, adding, ''Most species do not wink out in an instant.'' With the disappearance of Miss Waldron's red colobus, scientists have had a front-row seat.</p>
        <p>The last primate extinction documented by science occurred in the early 1700's, Dr. MacPhee said, with the disappearance from Jamaica of Xenothrix mcgregori. The next most recent extinctions occurred in Madagascar in the 1500's, he said, with the loss of several giant lemurs.</p>
        <p>Lists of endangered primates now include lemurs from Madagascar, tamarins from Brazil, langurs from Vietnam, Sumatran orangutans, gorillas, and a variety of monkeys.</p>
        <p>The last sightings of Miss Waldron's red colobus were in the 1970's, and a concerted seven-year effort to visit every last scrap of the swampy rain forests the monkey preferred ended late last month in the Ivory Coast without even a hint of its presence, said W. Scott McGraw, an anthropologist at Ohio State University who is a co-author of the paper.</p>
        <p>''A healthy forest is loud, but this was like being in a deserted cathedral,'' Dr. McGraw said. ''You don't hear anything, you don't hear birds. You stumble over snares and shotgun shells.''</p>
        <p>Dr. McGraw said he offered bounties to bush-meat hunters who could lead him to a red colobus -- $100 if he could hear the monkey's call or $200 for a sighting -- with no results. Satellite photographs were searched for any forgotten forest tracts.</p>
        <p>Many ecologists have projected that dozens of obscure species of plants and animals are becoming extinct each year as tropical forests are invaded by farmers, loggers and hunters. But these vanishings are all theoretical.</p>
        <p>What makes the apparent end of this monkey noteworthy, scientists say, is that it was a conspicuous, large mammal -- weighing up to 20 pounds -- and also because it was related, though distantly, to the scientists who studied it.</p>
        <p>''People don't really worry about cockroaches or newts too much, but when you lose a large primate that's a culmination of lots of years of evolution and with which we share a lot of genes, the consequences to humans of that kind of loss -- both practical and emotional -- are much greater,'' said John G. Robinson, a primatologist and vice president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which supported recent searches for the monkey.</p>
        <p>Miss Waldron's, Procolobus badius waldroni, is one of about a dozen variations of red colobus monkey, a group with distinctive long limbs and tails and a voracious appetite for the leaves of tropical treetops.</p>
        <p>The monkey was first described by scientists in 1936, based on eight specimens shot in 1933 by Willoughby P. Lowe, a collector for British museums. It was named for one Miss F. Waldron, who was described in various references as a traveling companion of Mr. Lowe.</p>
        <p>By the 1950's, deforestation and hunting were already threatening the monkey, although it remained common in a few places in southern Ghana.</p>
        <p>Echoing the authors of the paper, Peter Grubb, a zoologist and African mammal expert associated with the Natural History Museum in London, said that, with better management of game preserves in Ghana and the Ivory Coast, the monkey could probably have been saved.</p>
        <p>It is probably worth waiting awhile before Miss Waldron's is formally relegated to history, Dr. Grubb said, ''but it doesn't sound like there's much hope.''</p>
