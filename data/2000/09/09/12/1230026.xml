        <p>THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA  Correction:  September 16, 2000, Saturday  An entry in the Addenda listing of the Media Business page on Tuesday about Charles Schwab &amp; Company's selection of Halloran Robertson &amp; Associates in San Jose, Calif., to handle an assignment for its Advisor Source customer consulting service misidentified the agency that had the role previously. It was the San Francisco office of Brann Worldwide, part of Snyder Communications (which is being acquired by Havas Advertising), not Digitas in Boston.</p>
