        <p>CHARLES GRODIN was once notorious as the talk-show guest who zinged the host; the guy with the ironic sidelong look who would say anything. But as the man whose own cable talk show got canceled and received some of the most vicious reviews in television, he's got a thin skin.</p>
        <p>He'll joke that he knew the end was near on MSNBC, which canceled his show last November, when they took away his dressing room and he found himself changing in the makeup room. He'll say that he couldn't have been too bad or he wouldn't have the new gig on ''60 Minutes II,'' as the end-of-show commentator.</p>
        <p>But when it comes to what the critics had to say about Mr. Grodin as a pundit when he tackled such issues as capital punishment, the homeless and the rights of welfare mothers, ''I don't want to hear it,'' he says.</p>
        <p>This will make discussion difficult.</p>
        <p>''You know how it is, there's one negative thing, you remember it,'' Mr. Grodin says. Then, ''Don't you have any compliments? Oh, O.K., try to be specific.''</p>
        <p>People say you rant, Mr. Grodin.</p>
        <p>''That's right, I do rant,'' Mr. Grodin says. ''But I don't plan how I'm gonna come off. If I start getting angry it's not neat and clean and possibly plastic.''</p>
        <p>Addendum: ''It's not like the airways are filled with people trying to get people out of prison. If that was all there was all over the place, you wouldn't need somebody like me to be on television.''</p>
        <p>Additionally: ''You know, when I got canceled, Ralph Nader called Jack Welsh, who runs NBC, to register a complaint.''</p>
        <p>Is there anything more disappointing than a comic actor who decides to get serious? It's like hoping for a chocolate souffle and getting spinach. Not that there's anything wrong with spinach, but Mr. Grodin, 65, had been a man with a dark, original, funny presence. He made his name with ''The Heartbreak Kid'' and then played the beleaguered dad in the ''Beethoven'' movies, as co-star to a St. Bernard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grodin, these days, is very serious.</p>
        <p>Arriving for a chat at The New York Times, the first thing he wants to know is where the editorial writers are -- he wants to talk to them about reforming the stiff penalties of the Rockefeller drug law. He's still enough of a ham to do riffs in a crowded elevator and when pressed, he'll talk about the movies, a life he insists he is done with. Talking movies, he's funny. Asked about the making of the film ''Ishtar,'' he recalls walking a back street in Marrakesh with Dustin Hoffman.</p>
        <p>''Am I imagining this, or are a lot more people recognizing you than are recognizing me?'' Mr. Hoffman asks.</p>
        <p>''I've done a lot of community theater here,'' Mr. Grodin says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grodin was also, it turns out, not a guy to underrate himself. Offered the starring and star-making role in ''The Graduate'' as a young actor, he turned up his nose at the $500 weekly salary and lost the role. He had done Broadway by then, and the salary seemed ''inappropriate.''</p>
        <p>''If I think something is unfair, I won't do it, even if that might not be in my interests,'' Mr. Grodin says.</p>
        <p>WHAT Mr. Grodin wants to talk about these days, however, is social reform; the special he did for Court TV from the Bedford Hills Maximum Security Prison, which resulted in Christmas pardons last year for three female prisoners who had been serving long sentences under the Rockefeller drug law.</p>
        <p>How did a comic actor morph into social commentator?</p>
        <p>He had always been interested, Mr. Grodin says. Growing up in Pittsburgh, where his parents were in the dry-cleaning-supply business and he was the argumentative kid who got thrown out of class for talking too much, he had considered a career in journalism. In 1969, he produced a show with friends Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel which involved the Vietnam War and segregation.</p>
        <p>Then, five years ago, Mr. Grodin, who is married and has a young son, decided he no longer wanted to make movies.</p>
        <p>''I didn't leave acting to get involved socially and politically,'' Mr. Grodin says. ''I was not sitting on the set with a St. Bernard saying, 'I've got to get all those people out of prison.' I left because my son was entering the first grade and I no longer wanted to travel. Even then, I wasn't hired to do a talk show on social issues. I was supposed to be dessert, after Geraldo. Then the O. J. Simpson trial came along and all of a sudden I shifted back to where I started in 1969.''</p>
        <p>If the ratings were not great for his later shows, no matter. No one could have done well in his last time slot on MSNBC, Mr. Grodin insists: when they put you on at 7 Friday night, they just don't want you. Anyway, it should not be about ratings.</p>
        <p>You want to know what matters, let him tell you about those three women who were pardoned after he interviewed them and their children.</p>
        <p>''You know the Camus book 'The Stranger,' where a guy runs to help an old lady across the street because of the feeling he gets when he does it?'' Mr. Grodin says. ''That's what this is all about. I went to a reception in the Village when these people were let out. A reporter asked, 'How do you feel?' I couldn't even answer, it was so powerful. These were women I'd only seen in prison, now they were sitting there with their children. It was the most significant thing I've done in my life.''</p>
