        <p>Harry Prieste took the dare. Challenged by his friend, the swimmer Duke Kahanamoku, Prieste shinnied up a 15-foot flagpole at the end of the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, and stole the official flag. The Irish linen flag came home with Prieste to Los Angeles, the fruit of his athletic prank and further evidence of his presence at the seventh Summer Olympiad, where he won the bronze medal in platform diving.</p>
        <p>For 77 years the flag was stored in a suitcase during Prieste's years in swimming and diving shows, as a vaudeville comedian, a tumbler, a banjo player, a circus juggler and an Ice Follies performer.</p>
        <p>He did not regard the flag as valuable or worth returning until a reporter told him at a United States Olympic Committee banquet three years ago that the International Olympic Committee had been unable to find the missing Antwerp flag, the first one with the five rings.</p>
        <p>''I can help you with that,'' he said. ''It's in my suitcase.''</p>
        <p>Prieste, 103 years old, legally blind and severely deaf, returned the slightly faded and tattered flag to the I.O.C. today as the organization began a session leading up to the start of the Games on Friday.</p>
        <p>''I'm giving it to them,'' Prieste said. ''I ain't going to be around long. I had it a long time. A lot of my friends have seen it. You can't be selfish about these things. It's no good to me. I can't hang it in my room. People will think more of me by giving it away than by keeping it.''</p>
        <p>When told that he would be giving the flag to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the I.O.C. president, Prieste said, ''What's he going to do with it?''</p>
        <p>Prieste was born in 1896, the year of the first modern Olympics in Athens, with the name Haig Prieste. Before the Olympics, he was a stunt man and a Keystone Kop in Mack Sennett's silent comedies, then entered the 1920 Olympics under the name Harry Prieste. In his subsequent show business career, he was Hal Haig Prieste.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, he wanted to make sure that the plaque beside the Antwerp flag in the Olympic museum in Lausanne, Switzerland, will identify the man who returned it as ''Hal Haig Prieste.''</p>
        <p>''I'm informed by my friends in Belgium that the statute of limitations has run out on Mr. Prieste,'' said William Hybl, the president of the U.S.O.C.</p>
        <p>Prieste is the oldest living United States Olympian and possibly the oldest one in the world, said Cindy Stinger, who directs the U.S.O.C.'s alumni relations department. ''The I.O.C. wanted him to come to Nagano but it didn't happen,'' she said. ''I was worried, and the committee was worried, about someone this old traveling to Sydney.''</p>
        <p>But Prieste got medical approval, and arrived at the I.O.C. session dressed in a blue blazer, white shirt, colorful tie, white cap and white pants, sitting in a wheelchair he did not need until last year. Prieste, who learned to ice skate in his 40's and continued until he was 96, met Carolyn LaMaina at the Coliseum rink in Voorhees, N.J., where the Philadelphia Flyers used to train, and he was still performing on-ice tricks with a hockey stick.</p>
