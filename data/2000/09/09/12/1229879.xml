        <p>It's unbelievable that Dan Hicks gets laughs for his one-liners. Like this one, tossed out on Thursday at the Bowery Ballroom, where the singer-songwriter brought his re-formed band, the Hot Licks, for a long-awaited comeback.</p>
        <p>''Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,'' he drawled after the group played one of Mr. Hicks's jaunty western swing-influenced tunes. ''That's the most applause we've ever received for that tune. We've only played it twice. The other time was in Poughkeepsie.''</p>

        <p>It's unbelievable that Dan Hicks gets laughs for his one-liners. Like this one, tossed out on Thursday at the Bowery Ballroom, where the singer-songwriter brought his re-formed band, the Hot Licks, for a long-awaited comeback.</p>
        <p>''Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,'' he drawled after the group played one of Mr. Hicks's jaunty western swing-influenced tunes. ''That's the most applause we've ever received for that tune. We've only played it twice. The other time was in Poughkeepsie.''</p>
        <p>Ba-dum-bum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hicks gets away with such hackneyed material because his jokes are jokes on joking, just as his music is a sardonic meditation on musicality. Mixing jump blues, swing, folk, Opry-influenced country, samba and Django Rheinhardt-style Gypsy jazz in songs that proudly display their punch lines but have a tender side, too, Mr. Hicks and his Hot Licks explore a century's worth of entertainment pleasure.</p>
        <p>The first 60 years of the past century most strongly dictate Mr. Hicks's style. He started rummaging in pop's attic in the psychedelic era, helping shape the old-timey aspects of the San Francisco rock scene.</p>
        <p>A few near-novelty hits gained him national attention in the 1970's, notably ''How Can I Miss You When You Won't Go Away,'' which he performed on Thursday. But he wasn't the type for huge fame; like many Bay Area musicians, he chased his favorite tangents in the company of a cult audience.</p>
        <p>The cult includes stars like Elvis Costello, Bette Midler, Brian Setzer and Rickie Lee Jones, who all appear on the new Hot Licks album, ''Beatin' the Heat'' (Surfdog). None showed on Thursday, so it was left to the latest Hot Licks lineup to provide dazzle.</p>
        <p>It did, exhibiting the easy virtuosity that makes Mr. Hicks's music so much fun. The guitarist Tom Mitchell flew into many a Wes Montgomery-influenced run while Ozzie Andrews, on stand-up bass, was versatile and engaging. Brian Godchaux on violin and mandolin, a speed demon with a light touch, stood out without showing off.</p>
        <p>Also featured were the Lickettes, Susan Rabin and Debbie Kee. They were Mr. Hicks's Greek chorus and harmonic foil, their flirtatious singing complementing his reedy tenor. They also added rhythm with a wide array of percussion instruments, including a finger cymbal, expertly deployed by Ms. Rabin during ''I Scare Myself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hicks added accents on a well-worn snare drum and sang in his foxy drawl, only sometimes pinching on the high notes. He tripped through oldies like ''Canned Music'' and new winners like ''I Don't Want Love'' like an old charmer drawing in everyone at the bar with the tales he spins.</p>
        <p>He never had to say, ''Stop me if you've heard this one,'' because when Dan Hicks tells it, the quip is always fresh.</p>
