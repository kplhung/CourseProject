        <p>House conservatives, who five years ago forced a government shutdown to combat spending and later helped oust Newt Gingrich as speaker, have retreated this year and stayed mostly silent about President Clinton's desire for significant increases in spending levels.</p>
        <p>Rather than try to shut down the government or hamstring the Republican leadership at every turn, as they previously did to get what they wanted during year-end negotiations, these conservatives, members of the so-called rebel class elected in 1994, have embraced the art of Washington politics, in many cases swapping principle for pragmatism.</p>
        <p>With their number reduced to 60 or so stalwarts, the conservatives say they have learned to make peace with Mr. Clinton's powerful veto pen, to compromise and practice patience, and to funnel money back home to protect themselves and the tenuous Republican hold on the House. They recognize that their party's House majority of only seven seats does not allow them to behave like revolutionaries.</p>
        <p>More important, though, their crusade to slash spending has become difficult to justify to their leaders and constituents in an era of budget surpluses. They are soldiers in flux, their mission blunted by prosperity. In the 1994 campaign, they coalesced around ridding the country of a ballooning deficit, balancing the budget and ending wasteful spending. Now, they say, much of that has been accomplished.</p>
        <p>''This past month, I was running around the district trying to find one person that still seemed interested in spending in Washington,'' said a onetime firebrand, Representative Joe Scarborough of Florida. ''Republicans have been the victim of their own success, just like after the cold war.''</p>
        <p>Put another way, Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina, an uncompromising fiscal conservative, said with disappointment, ''the class of '94 has really been co-opted.''</p>
        <p>''Our game now is trade-offs,'' Mr. Sanford said. ''What marbles can we trade, as opposed to the old line of when we first got here that this is a matter of principle.''</p>
        <p>Another factor in the conservatives' relative quiet is that they have reason to bide their time, mindful that Gov. George W. Bush could win the White House and smooth the way for many of their causes. Mr. Sanford summed up the prevailing sentiment of his conservative colleagues and the Republican leadership this way: ''Let's not make waves, so we don't cause a train wreck, because it will all be fixed when Bush gets in.''</p>
        <p>(In fact, over in the Senate some Republicans up for election this fall are doing their best to run from the conservative label. ''We've seen dozens of Republican general-election ads, and not one has contained the words 'Republican' or 'conservative,' '' said Jim Jordan, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats' campaign committee.)</p>
        <p>Although their numbers have dwindled and their goals grown more splintered and less intensely focused, House conservatives have not given up the fight entirely. Their list of demands may be much shorter now -- gone for the most part are battles over the National Endowment for the Arts, education and, in many cases, abortion -- but they have not totally abandoned the fight over spending, arguing that several appropriations bills for the rapidly approaching 2001 fiscal year exceed spending limits outlined in the Congressional budget resolution.</p>
        <p>Republican and Democratic leaders will meet with Mr. Clinton at the White House on Tuesday in the first discussions to determine exactly what spending levels he wants. Many Republicans voice doubt that Mr. Clinton will negotiate in good faith, feeling that he is more interested in provoking disputes that would help Democrats at the polls.</p>
        <p>In any event, conservatives trying to blunt the increase in spending hope to offer a plan to protect some of the surplus by setting aside $2 billion to $5 billion for each of the 13 major spending bills and using that money to help pay down the federal debt. The idea pleases Republican leaders and is a politically popular one that would be difficult for Mr. Clinton to oppose.</p>
        <p>The conservatives may also force an impasse on several of the president's top policy priorities, including legislation to make hate attacks on gays a federal crime, to expand school construction and to tighten gun control.</p>
        <p>''Our base doesn't expect us to win, but they want to make sure we're fighting for them,'' said Representative John Shadegg, an Arizona Republican who is chairman of the House's 60-member Conservative Action Team.</p>
        <p>Still, that is a far cry from the all-or-nothing position of the bulk of 73  freshmen elected in 1994 who became the foot soldiers of Mr. Gingrich's Republican revolution. Beginning in the next Congress, a band of the rebellious freshmen held up major spending bills with their insistence on stripping financing from the National Endowment for the Arts, on preventing federal dollars to be used for abortion or for counseling abortion, and on permitting replacement of striking workers, among many other demands. In 1995, they fueled the push to seek a balanced budget by 2002, and shut down the government to do so, a move that backfired politically.</p>
        <p>Now many of those hard-line rebels -- known as CATS, for members of the Conservative Action Team -- have mellowed in tone and tactics, and have acknowledged their willingness to compromise or even accept failure so long as they can say the House tried.</p>
        <p>''I'm a practical conservative now,'' Representative Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said without a touch of remorse. ''I'll vote for bills that I wouldn't have voted for two years ago.''</p>
        <p>Speaker J. Dennis Hastert has abetted their transition. It was Mr. Hastert's predecessor, Mr. Gingrich, who became one target of the conservatives' ire. Though a rebel himself, Mr. Gingrich often simply issued dictates and seldom sat down to listen to them, the conservatives said. They also said he was quick to promise much and deliver little.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hastert, a conciliator whom the conservatives say they trust, has set a less combative tone and explained the difficulty of governing with so slim a majority. Had Mr. Gingrich still been in charge, said Representative Mark Souder of Indiana, ''the CATS group, as well as moderates, would have blown up by now.''</p>
        <p>''Denny identifies,'' Mr. Souder said, ''really listens, changes and then says, 'How would you do it?' ''</p>
        <p>Representative Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican who is critical of the majority leadership, nonetheless concedes differences between Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Hastert. ''You can absolutely trust what Denny Hastert tells you,'' Mr. Coburn said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coburn is one of a shrinking number of rebels who say that the budget surplus notwithstanding, they cannot tolerate all this capitulation on spending. Mr. Sanford is another. Both men are leaving at the end of this term, making good on pledges to serve no more than six years in the House. Their farewells, they say, are colored with disillusion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coburn and Mr. Sanford say that for all the talk of accomplishments, Republicans have abandoned their principles for the sake of political survival and lost sight of grander goals: less government and the adoption of bedrock conservative social policies.</p>
        <p>''Our leadership has not had courage to face Clinton down,'' Mr. Coburn said, ''because they're more interested in maintaining control of Congress than doing what's best for the country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanford put it this way: ''The most frequent words you probably heard in those CAT meetings four years ago is, 'This is a matter of principle, and we can't vote for this.'  But I guess as time goes by and one becomes a more seasoned legislator, the best word now is, 'What can we trade off in this bill?' That is a pretty, pretty, pretty violent contrast.''</p>
        <p>Unquestionably, the two words that do not cross any of the rebels' lips is 'government shutdown.' Now it is Mr. Clinton, they note, who is making that veiled threat, a development they cite with a chuckle.</p>
        <p>''It's a nice little switch,'' Mr. Scarborough said. ''We wish him all the best. It's not as fun as it sounds.''</p>
