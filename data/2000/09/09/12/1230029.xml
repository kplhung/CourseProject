        <p>After reprimanding a woman doused by pesticides for not paying more attention to the city's spraying schedule, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani corrected himself yesterday, saying that the city had in fact been spraying in the woman's area without warning.</p>

        <p>After reprimanding a woman doused by pesticides for not paying more attention to the city's spraying schedule, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani corrected himself yesterday, saying that the city had in fact been spraying in the woman's area without warning.</p>
        <p>''It did start at 10, not at midnight,'' Mr. Giuliani said, referring to the time on the evening of Sept. 3 when city trucks sprayed Manhattan with the pesticide Anvil to kill mosquitoes with the West Nile virus.</p>
        <p>The woman, an artist, told The Daily News that she had been sprayed on West 58th Street in Manhattan at 10:45 p.m. Sept. 3. The truck, she said, sprayed her at close range and shot pesticides straight into her face, eyes, nose and mouth, causing severe nausea and blurred vision over three days. She also said she was worried about long-term effects, because she has a form of asthma that reacts to chemicals.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani acknowledged at a news conference on Saturday that the woman was treated at an emergency room on Sept. 4, but said there was ''obviously a discrepancy'' between the city's spraying schedule and the woman's account of when she was sprayed. He seemed to suggest that the woman may have been on the streets after midnight without realizing it and failed to heed warning about the spraying.</p>
        <p>''If you hear an announcement that spraying is going to take place, then the spraying isn't going to stop if you remain standing there,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''They don't know you are standing there, so pay attention to the announcements and when you see the police cars, there's a reason for it.''</p>
        <p>But at a news conference yesterday in Harlem, Mr. Giuliani said that he had been given the wrong information and that the spraying had in fact started at 10 p.m., but he did not apologize.</p>
        <p>Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, who accompanied Mr. Giuliani at the news conference, said that the spraying trucks left ''prematurely'' and that one person was exposed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen added that the woman was treated and released from the hospital and that the spraying had caused ''some aggravation'' of ''an underlying respiratory disorder.''</p>
        <p>He said city officials ''spoke to her this weekend, she's under medical supervision, she's home, and we believe that she's recovering.''</p>
