        <p>Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, the federal agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid, announced today that she was resigning on Oct. 1 to take a temporary job teaching at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeParle said she would become a fellow at the Institute of Politics, which is affiliated with the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.</p>
        <p>Her resignation comes near the end of a presidential campaign in which Medicare is a major issue.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeParle said that she had known Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic candidate for president, for more than two decades.</p>
        <p>''I'm one of his biggest fans,'' said Ms. DeParle, who, like Mr. Gore, is from Tennessee. ''I want to do everything I can to help him be elected and to do a great job with the Medicare program. The vice president is a friend. But I don't have any plans to join a Gore administration. I feel ready to get back to the private sector, and that's what I'll be pursuing over the next several months.''</p>
        <p>The Health Care Financing Administration helps pay medical bills for more 75 million Americans and has a budget of more than $330 billion this year.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeParle worked at the White House Office of Management and Budget from 1993 to 1997. She became deputy administrator of the Medicare-Medicaid agency in July 1997, and four months later she was confirmed by the Senate as head of the agency.</p>
        <p>In an e-mail message to agency employees today, Ms. DeParle said: ''Through your hard work, we have accomplished some of the Clinton administration's most important policy goals. We extended the life of the Medicare trust fund through 2025 and began significant initiatives to modernize Medicare.''</p>
        <p>Ms. DeParle supervised the first years of the Children's Health Insurance Program, created by Congress in 1997. She supervised hundreds of changes in the way Medicare pays doctors, hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers. Her top priority last year was to fix government computers for the year 2000, so benefit payments would not be delayed.</p>
        <p>''We put beneficiaries first in everything we've done,'' Ms. DeParle said.</p>
        <p>Members of Congress of both parties worked closely with Ms. DeParle. But Republicans, some Democrats and many health care providers have criticized the agency as a heavy-handed regulator.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers said the agency had been slow to recognize two major problems in the last few years. Officials initially underestimated the importance of decisions by health maintenance organizations to pull out of the Medicare program, forcing hundreds of thousands of elderly people to make other arrangements for health insurance.</p>
        <p>Agency officials were also slow to notice that hundreds of thousands of poor people had been improperly deprived of Medicaid coverage when they lost welfare benefits. In the 1996 welfare law, Congress tried to restrict eligibility for cash assistance while preserving access to Medicaid, but many states inadvertently cut off Medicaid for people leaving the welfare rolls.</p>
