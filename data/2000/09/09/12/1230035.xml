        <p>Darryl Strawberry, currently suspended from baseball for violating terms of his drug program and still recovering from treatment for a cancer relapse, was arrested yesterday in Tampa, Fla., and charged with reckless driving and leaving the scene of an accident.</p>
        <p>It was the latest setback for the 38-year-old Strawberry, who missed most of last season, has not played this year and no longer seems to have a viable future as a baseball player.</p>
        <p>In yesterday's incident, Strawberry was taken into custody at gunpoint shortly after 9 a.m. by an off-duty police officer who witnessed Strawberry's sports utility vehicle hit a street sign and then strike the rear of another S.U.V. stopped for a red light.</p>
        <p>Strawberry was being held without bail in Hillsborough County Jail pending a court hearing today.</p>
        <p>The officer, Sgt. Anthony Kolka, told The Associated Press that when he confronted Strawberry, with his pistol drawn, he had to bang on the window of Strawberry's vehicle to get his attention.</p>
        <p>Kolka said Strawberry kept asking: ''What did I do? What did I do?''</p>
        <p>''He said he didn't know he hit the car or the sign,'' Kolka said. The officer said he drew the gun for ''my own safety and everybody else's,'' and that he was not initially aware that the driver was Strawberry.</p>
        <p>Joseph Ficarrotta, a lawyer for Strawberry, told The Associated Press that Strawberry had ''blacked out'' while driving because of a reaction to prescription medication and that when he visited him later in the day he seemed ''very weak and very tired.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Hillsborough County sheriff's department said Strawberry told officers he had taken a sleeping medication, Ambien, and Ficarrotta said that Strawberry also has prescriptions for two painkillers -- Percocet and Vicodin.</p>
        <p>A blood-alcohol test showed no alcohol in his system; the result of a urine test was not yet available.</p>
