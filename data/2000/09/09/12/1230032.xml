        <p>Bernard B. Kerik, the city's new police commissioner, said yesterday that his changes in the department since taking office had been part of a larger plan to create an incentive system by which the most active officers would be rewarded for hard work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik assumed command of the nation's largest Police Department three weeks ago. Since taking charge, he has reassigned two top chiefs to less prominent posts and ordered his commanders to move at least 300 officers from quality-of-life enforcement to street patrols and to assign more officers to traditional detective duties.</p>

        <p>Bernard B. Kerik, the city's new police commissioner, said yesterday that his changes in the department since taking office had been part of a larger plan to create an incentive system by which the most active officers would be rewarded for hard work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerik assumed command of the nation's largest Police Department three weeks ago. Since taking charge, he has reassigned two top chiefs to less prominent posts and ordered his commanders to move at least 300 officers from quality-of-life enforcement to street patrols and to assign more officers to traditional detective duties.</p>
        <p>In every case but one, he said, the transfers have been meant to reward highly active officers or to reassign less-successful ones, part of his belief that the department needs ''an incentive device for cops to sort of become competitive.''</p>
        <p>''Competition is a great thing,'' Mr. Kerik said. ''I want to create a method by which whoever the best is, they get identified, and they get rewarded.''</p>
        <p>As he begins to exert his influence over the department, Mr. Kerik, 44, the city's 40th police commissioner, is operating within the confines of a tight time line. Police commissioners typically serve at the pleasure of the mayor who appoints them, and, in this case, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has less than 16 months remaining in office, leaving the commissioner little time to leave a mark on a sprawling and complicated agency, a place in which public expectations are high, internal politics are relentless and the overwhelming majority of employees have union protection.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in his first informal interview with the reporters who regularly cover the Police Department, Mr. Kerik said that he was in the midst of a top-to-bottom review of the 40,000-member force and had not yet learned all of the details he needed to be a fully informed manager. He said he expected to be more completely schooled in the job by mid-October or early November.</p>
        <p>He also stressed that he had not yet developed his larger plans for the department. ''Is there one big, you now, organized plan right now?'' he said. ''No. Right now I'm focusing on areas where I think need immediate attention.''</p>
        <p>These areas, he said, included creating his leadership team and thinning the ranks of the tracer units, which have focused on quality-of-life summonses. The transfers, he said, allow him to increase by a modest amount the number of officers assigned to patrol and detective duties. He also said he was focusing on police activity in the Bronx, where the homicide rate has climbed this year while the citywide rate has been virtually flat.</p>
        <p>''I think we need a substantial reduction of what we're seeing in the Bronx,'' Mr. Kerik said.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Kerik treaded carefully around the larger question of his intentions for deploying the department's considerable resources at a time when crime is at a 35-year low but relations with many residents are strained.</p>
        <p>He said, for instance, that he had not yet decided whether he would change the department's use of specialized outfits, such as the Street Crime Units, which roam neighborhoods in plainclothes in search of illegal guns. And he said he had no immediate plans to change Operation Condor, a program that has provided money to pay for overtime for extra narcotics enforcement. Operation Condor, he said, has ''been a good program; it's produced great results.''</p>
        <p>''Do we want to look at the way it operates,'' he said. ''Yes. Am I going to do anything with it now? Not now.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Kerik's changes to date have been modest, reaction to them has generally been positive. Last week, the union representing detectives praised the new commissioner's decision to assign more officers to detective duty, and yesterday, some experts said the commissioner had sent the right signals to both the community and the rank and file.</p>
        <p>Assigning more officers to precinct houses is a smart step, they said. ''It's symbolic of the idea that you are going to hold borough commanders responsible for the crime in their neighborhoods,'' said Jerome H. Skolnick, a professor at New York University School of Law who teaches a seminar in police practices.</p>
        <p>''I think he's giving clear signals that he understands that precincts are where the action is,'' said former Commissioner William J. Bratton.</p>
        <p>Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission and author of ''NYPD: A City and Its Police'' (Henry Holt &amp; Company, 2000), said the new commissioner was showing some of the same traits that earned him a reputation as an effective manager as commissioner of the Department of Correction.</p>
        <p>''He's certainly right not to just accept the status quo,'' Mr. Reppetto said. ''He has to look at every part of the department, every aspect of the department, and make his own decisions on whether it is being run right or not.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Kerik said he intended to reward top performers and review the assignments of those who were not successful, he said one recent reassignment -- the transfer of Chief of Patrol John Scanlon to the Transit Bureau -- was not linked in any way to the department's handling of the sex attacks after the Puerto Rican Day Parade in June, as had been suggested by some police officials in recent days.</p>
        <p>''Jack Scanlon is a great guy,'' Mr. Kerik said, and was replaced simply to make way for another officer, Chief William A. Morange, whom the new commissioner wants in his leadership team. Chief Scanlon said last week that rather than accept the transfer, he was retiring.</p>
