        <p>C. J. Hunter, the reigning world champion in the shot-put and the husband of the sprinter Marion Jones, became the latest in a growing number of athletes to withdraw from the Sydney Olympics today, a week after undergoing surgery on torn cartilage in his left knee.</p>
        <p>''I'm disappointed the injury has forced me to withdraw from the Olympic Games,'' Hunter said in a statement. ''Marion and I had looked forward to competing together in Sydney. But I'm a professional athlete. Unfortunately, injuries are part of the game.''</p>
        <p>Hunter, who grew up in Hyde Park, N.Y., will be replaced on the American team by John Godina, who won a silver medal in the shot-put at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. Godina has already been training in Australia for the discus, at which he will also compete in the Sydney Games. Hunter's withdrawal comes only two days after Regina Jacobs of Oakland, Calif., a gold-medal favorite in the women's 1,500 meters, dropped out with a respiratory viral infection.</p>
        <p>The United States has also lost one of its female gymnasts to injury. Morgan White, 17, will miss the Games because of a stress fracture in her left foot. She will be replaced by Tasha Schwikert, a 15-year-old from Las Vegas. Schwikert was one of two alternates; Alyssa Beckerman is the other.</p>
        <p>Hunter injured his knee last month and tried to throw at a Grand Prix meet in Brussels, only to withdraw after several throws because of persistent pain. He underwent surgery last Sunday and said that he still hoped to compete in Sydney.</p>
