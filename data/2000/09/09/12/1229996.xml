        <p>Deploring what it called the ''pervasive and aggressive marketing'' of violent entertainment to children, the Federal Trade Commission said today that the vast majority of the best-selling restricted movies, music and video games were deliberately marketed to children as young as 12.</p>
        <p>The commission, reporting on a yearlong study, released an internal memorandum, apparently from a movie studio about an R-rated film,  that said its promotional ''goal was to find the elusive teen target audience and make sure everyone between the ages of 12-18 was exposed to the film.''</p>

        <p>Deploring what it called the ''pervasive and aggressive marketing'' of violent entertainment to children, the Federal Trade Commission said today that the vast majority of the best-selling restricted movies, music and video games were deliberately marketed to children as young as 12.</p>
        <p>The commission, reporting on a yearlong study, released an internal memorandum, apparently from a movie studio about an R-rated film,  that said its promotional ''goal was to find the elusive teen target audience and make sure everyone between the ages of 12-18 was exposed to the film.''</p>
        <p>Another memorandum described how fliers and posters about an R-rated movie would be distributed in Kansas City to organizations like the Campfire Boys and Girls.</p>
        <p>A memorandum about an M-rated video game characterized the ''primary'' audience as ''males 12-17.''</p>
        <p>But the trade commission's chairman carefully avoided blaming violent entertainment for violence in society.</p>
        <p>Entertainment industry officials have repeatedly denied that their companies deliberately direct advertisements toward children. They have said it is impossible in modern  communications to keep promotions of products for young adults away from the eyes and ears of children.</p>
        <p>Jack Valenti, chairman of the Motion Picture Association of America, declined to discuss the report.</p>
        <p>But studio executives acknowledged privately today that the report had some validity.</p>
        <p>''Everyone's hands are dirty,'' one executive said.</p>
        <p>Film studio executives said the advertising was sometimes blurry. R-rated films are promoted, they pointed out, on teenage shows like ''Dawson's Creek.'' About 25 percent of the audience for that show is 17 or younger. The issue becomes even more complicated in television shows where, for example, 60 percent of the audience is 17 or younger.</p>
        <p>''The question is, where do you draw the line,'' the marketing chief of one film company said.</p>
        <p>Another marketing executive said that studios traditionally sought to tap into male audiences by advertising R-rated films on shows like ''World Wide Wrestling'' and sports programs that children watch, as well as on MTV.</p>
        <p>''You are within your boundaries when you advertise,'' said one studio marketing executive, ''but what do you do when 8-year-olds are watching wrestling and you're advertising an R-rated movie?''</p>
        <p>The ratings established by trade associations are voluntary and do not carry the force of law. Under the system, R-rated films are supposed to require an adult to accompany children younger than 17. M-rated video games are not supposed to be sold to children younger than 17.</p>
        <p>In another case described by the commission, an advertising summary for a recording labeled as having violent content identified the ''target audience'' as listeners 12 to 34.</p>
        <p>By law, the commission was not allowed to identify the companies responsible for the memorandums that described marketing aimed at children. Mary K. Engle, a lawyer at the agency, said the documents had been submitted to the commission under procedures that prohibit disclosure of trade secrets or other confidential information.</p>
        <p>But the commission examined a sample of movies, recordings and electronic games selected because they were best-selling products or those judged most likely to appeal to young people, and it found that in the vast majority of the cases, advertising had been aimed at children.</p>
        <p>All 55 music recordings with labels that indicated explicit content were marketed to children younger than 17. So were 35 of the 44 movies rated R, or 80 percent, and 83 of the 118 video games, or 70 percent.</p>
        <p>The commission found that violent movies, recordings and electronic games were heavily advertised in outlets likely to reach children younger than 17 -- television programs like ''South Park'' and ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and magazines like Teen, Jump and YM.</p>
        <p>For the last several days, Democratic politicians have used the commission's report to burnish their credentials as crusaders against violence in popular culture.</p>
        <p>The gist of the commission's findings was reported Sunday based on interviews with officials familiar with the report. Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate, and his running mate, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, took note of the study and said that if elected, they would offer legislation or new regulations to crack down on the entertainment industry if the industry did not take steps to comply with the recommendations of the Federal Trade Commission within six months.</p>
        <p>Today, President Clinton, making a rare appearance with Hillary Rodham Clinton to support her Senate candidacy in New York at the Jewish Community Center in New Rochelle, condemned the abuses cited in the report. The Clintons suggested they would support government restraints if the industry did not curb advertising aimed at underage audiences.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, agreed today that the entertainment industry needed to rein in its marketing practices. But he questioned Mr. Gore's credibility, saying the vice president had not previously taken a strong stand against violence in entertainment.</p>
        <p>In an unusual political twist, the Senate commerce committee, under the chairmanship of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, will hold a hearing on Wednesday about the commission's findings and provide a forum for Mr. Lieberman, who is scheduled as a witness. Also testifying will be several other politicians, entertainment industry executives and representatives of advocacy groups.</p>
        <p>President Clinton ordered the Federal Trade Commission study last year shortly after the massacre by two teenagers at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo.</p>
        <p>Robert Pitofsky, the commission's chairman, said at a news conference today that no particular companies were worse offenders than others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitofsky also was careful not to blame violent entertainment for the violence in society. ''We reviewed the literature and found that scholars and observers generally agree that exposure to violent materials alone does not cause a child to commit a violent act,'' he said. ''Exposure to violent materials probably is not even the most important factor. It is nevertheless a valid cause for concern. Exposure does seem to correlate with aggressive attitudes, insensitivity to violence and an exaggerated view of how much violence occurs in the world.''</p>
        <p>In some instances, Mr. Pitofsky said, 80 percent to 90 percent of the people assembled in groups to test-market violent films were younger than 17. In eight of the 44 films studied, the test group included children as young as 12, he said.</p>
        <p>Ideally, Mr. Pitofsky said, the entertainment industry would strengthen its self-regulation. If that did not work, he said, he would consider new legislation or enforcement under existing law. But he quickly added, ''That's down the road.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitofsky said he was concerned about violating the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. ''I don't want the Federal Trade Commission to be the thought police,'' he said. ''I don't want a bureaucrat like me influencing the content of these materials, but rather, we need to influence the way these materials are marketed.''</p>
        <p>He suggested that trade associations publish the names of their members who direct marketing of restricted products to underage audiences. ''A little sunlight might be a very effective sanction in this area,'' he said.</p>
