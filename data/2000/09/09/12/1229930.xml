        <p>Indiana University's campus in Bloomington was rainy and calm yesterday after a night of angry demonstrations over Bob Knight's ouster as basketball coach and threats against the student whose accusations were a factor in Knight's dismissal.</p>
        <p>But there were signs of more potential fallout from the end of Knight's three-decade reign at Indiana. Several players demanded that one of Knight's assistants, either Mike Davis or John Treloar, be hired as the interim coach; if one of the assistants is not hired, they said, they will leave the university. Other players, including Dane Fife, a junior guard, said they were considering leaving anyway.</p>

        <p>Indiana University's campus in Bloomington was rainy and calm yesterday after a night of angry demonstrations over Bob Knight's ouster as basketball coach and threats against the student whose accusations were a factor in Knight's dismissal.</p>
        <p>But there were signs of more potential fallout from the end of Knight's three-decade reign at Indiana. Several players demanded that one of Knight's assistants, either Mike Davis or John Treloar, be hired as the interim coach; if one of the assistants is not hired, they said, they will leave the university. Other players, including Dane Fife, a junior guard, said they were considering leaving anyway.</p>
        <p>''If things work out the way we want it, we'll stay,'' George Leach, a sophomore, told The Associated Press. ''We are ready to go if they don't meet our demands. Indiana will not have a team.''</p>
        <p>The players' reactions underscored the intense loyalty inspired by Knight, a Hall of Fame coach who has a history of abusive behavior. All were somber and some were teary at the news conference Sunday when Myles Brand, the university's president, announced Knight's ouster.</p>
        <p>When Davis, one of the assistant coaches, was asked Sunday if he would stay, he said: ''Coach brought me here; he gave me this job. Whatever Coach tells me to do, whatever the players say, I'm going to do it.''</p>
        <p>Some rabid fans among the students had a similar reaction on Sunday, calling for the resignation of Brand. Thousands of students marched to Brand's home on campus Sunday night, chanting ''Hey, hey, ho, ho, Myles Brand has got to go!'' while police officers in riot gear watched.</p>
        <p>The demonstrators also handed out flyers with a picture of Kent Harvey, the freshman who had lodged the most recent complaint against Knight, with a caption reading: ''Wanted. Dead.''</p>
        <p>Horns blared across campus. Signs and banners appeared on dormitories and fraternities. One read ''Bob Knight is God,'' and another said, ''Mr. Knight 4 President.''</p>
        <p>Just before the protests, Knight met with his team. He then appeared outside Assembly Hall and addressed student supporters.</p>
        <p>''In the next couple of days, I'm going to get together somewhere with as many students who want to come out, and then I'm going to tell you my side of this thing,'' the 59-year-old coach said. ''And I think you'll be interested in hearing it.''</p>
        <p>In dismissing Knight, Brand cited a pattern of ''uncivil, defiant and unacceptable'' behavior since May that culminated last week with Harvey's accusation that Knight had manhandled him and verbally abused him. Knight accosted Harvey because he had failed to use an honorific when he spoke to the coach, saying only: ''Hey, Knight, what's up?''</p>
        <p>But Brand stressed that the incident with Harvey was just one of many transgressions by Knight since the university gave him an ultimatum last May to control his behavior or face dismissal.</p>
        <p>On campus yesterday, some students expressed anger over Knight's departure, while others were indifferent or supported Brand's decision. The ugliness of Sunday night's protests seemed to have blown over. The campus was full of glum faces and had an almost funereal quiet.</p>
        <p>Waiting for a campus bus, Micheala Karr, a senior, rolled her eyes when asked about Knight. ''I didn't come here because of I.U. basketball,'' she said. ''Anyone who is thinking of leaving I.U. because of this has whacked-up priorities.''</p>
        <p>Michael Burton, a graduate student, said it was ''time for Bob Knight to move on anyway.'' Burton said the protests had disgusted him. ''That was only a small percentage of the students here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Matt McGregor, a senior, said a less authoritarian coach might do a better job. ''President Brand did what he had to do,'' he said. ''I like Bobby Knight, but I'm not sure we could win a championship under him in this era.''</p>
        <p>Some students said they expected many fans to boycott the season. ''I think a lot of people are going to protest and not buy tickets,'' Courtney Clark, a junior, said.</p>
        <p>Even students who had protested said they were resigned to losing the coach. Joe Ryan, a junior, said Knight and the basketball program were one of the main reasons he had chosen the university.</p>
        <p>''I think most students realize it is a lost cause,'' Ryan said. ''He is already fired.''</p>
        <p>But other Hoosiers fans said they felt something precious had been lost. ''Bobby Knight is like a god here,'' said Ian Kara Novich, who described himself as a lifelong Hoosiers fanatic. ''It's not going to be the same.''</p>
