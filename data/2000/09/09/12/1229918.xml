        <p>When the Olympics come to American television Friday, the maestro overseeing the five-hour nightly extravaganza will be Dick Ebersol.</p>
        <p>No sports television executive has held as much power in the Olympics as Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. No one has spent as much for the TV rights or is as close to Juan Antonio Samaranch, the embattled president of the International Olympic Committee.</p>
        <p>And no one has had the opportunity since Ebersol's mentor, Roone Arledge, to shape so completely how Americans will view the Summer Games.</p>
        <p>''I love the idea of being in the middle of a 28-ring circus,'' said Ebersol, who persuaded General Electric, NBC's parent, to underwrite his passion with $3.5 billion for the rights to televise the Olympics from 2000 to 2008. ''I love being the guy in the center of all that, sorting out what we're doing and what the viewer is going to see. There isn't anything like that.''</p>
        <p>Ebersol has been closely identified with the National Basketball Association and with deals that coincided with the ascent of Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. But his legacy rests with the Olympics, as a deal maker and an executive producer, roles played by Arledge at ABC from the early 1960's to the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if he came to us as an Olympic freak,'' said Arledge, who hired Ebersol in 1967 as the first Olympic researcher at ABC Sports when Ebersol was 19 and a sophomore at Yale. ''But he became one.''</p>
        <p>Ebersol's Manhattan office features a giant photograph of Muhammad Ali lighting the Olympic caldron at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and a coffee table painted with images from the 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there's anything I love more than the Olympics, other than family,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He is not likely to see much of his wife, the actress Susan Saint James, and their 10-year-old son, Teddy, the only one of their children who will be in Sydney.</p>
        <p>By 6:15 each morning, Ebersol will begin his 20-hour day at the NBC compound after lifting 15-pound weights and running three and a half miles on a treadmill, a regimen he started four years ago after he suffered a mild heart attack.</p>
        <p>From his ''Captain Kirk'' chair inside NBC's control room or from a seat in an adjacent office, Ebersol will control what Americans see from Sydney. He will view what is happening on more than 100 monitors, make suggestions to his chief producers, Tommy Roy and David Neal, speak to commentators arrayed across Sydney or ask a deputy, Peter Diamond, how one change in each evening's preset formats would affect the rest of the show.</p>
        <p>''I'd be shocked if we didn't change the formats by as much as a third, as we go along,'' Ebersol said.</p>
        <p>While the Olympic events beamed to American viewers will be taped, Bob Costas, the prime-time host, will be live in the studio in Sydney, introducing events, providing reports and delivering commentary. Ebersol will occasionally speak into his earpiece.</p>
        <p>''It's usually guidance,'' Costas said. ''I may say something, and he'll say something amusing. He's a very calm presence no matter the circumstance.''</p>
        <p>In their third Olympics as a unit, Costas, the production crew and most of the commentators know Ebersol's Olympic formula. ''Storytelling is king,'' said Bucky Gunts, who directs the prime-time show.</p>
        <p>Ebersol takes the work so seriously that he bans all unessential personnel from his Olympic workplace, including his wife and Jack Welch, the G.E. chairman.</p>
        <p>''It's so annoying,'' Saint James said. ''I'm from the business. I know how to be quiet.''</p>
        <p>Ebersol explained: ''This job requires 100 percent concentration. When air traffic controllers let families in to watch them work, I'll let Susan in.''</p>
        <p>Ebersol, 53, is the most vocal and image-conscious of the four networks' sports division leaders. Like Arledge, he is a producer-executive who revels in being his division's public relations specialist. But primarily he is a pragmatic executive protecting his self-interest, never more so than in his vigorous defense of Samaranch.</p>
        <p>''I just didn't care what was said against him,'' said Ebersol, referring to criticism that Samaranch personified the hidebound I.O.C. bureaucracy that led to the Salt Lake City corruption scandal last year. ''There is no question in my mind that there was no way back from the abyss without Juan.''</p>
        <p>Ebersol, whose strong ties with the Olympic committee were enhanced by his appointment to its reform commission, recalled flying to Lausanne, Switzerland, in March 1999 after reading an article in which Samaranch scorned American politicians who were threatening to sanction the I.O.C. if it did not overhaul the way it did business.</p>
        <p>''Right or wrong, I told him, 'You get nowhere taking on the American political system,' '' Ebersol recalled. ''But I said, 'If you want me to, I'll spread the word about what you'll do to key Washington politicians.' ''</p>
        <p>Ebersol said he had met with Senator John S. McCain, Republican of Arizona, a harsh I.O.C. critic, and George Mitchell, the former senator whose commission recommended an overhaul of the United States Olympic Committee.</p>
        <p>Ebersol said he had stewed for months as David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock Financial Services, an Olympic sponsor, lambasted Samaranch. Then in June 1999, Ebersol exploded during a conference call with reporters.</p>
        <p>''I'm sick of watching this two-bit bully get on his soapbox,'' he said of D'Alessandro. ''His actions demanded a response and that response is, 'Shut up.' ''</p>
        <p>Ebersol's tongue-lashing heartened the international committee, which needed to assuage sponsors' worries that the scandal was diminishing the value of their Olympic investments. Having Ebersol's passionate faith meant the I.O.C. was blessed by its largest benefactor, who was protecting both his friend and his investment.</p>
        <p>Dick Pound, an I.O.C. vice president, said, ''It was important for someone to speak out in favor of what the Olympics were all about.''</p>
        <p>Three months later, Ebersol quietly met with D'Alessandro for the first time in Boston.</p>
        <p>''Both of us felt this was a rocket that was getting away from both of us and it was getting personal,'' D'Alessandro said. ''But part of the issue is that we'd never met. I've learned over time that it's easier to throw shots at somebody you didn't know.''</p>
        <p>Ebersol said, ''We got through the frostiness and talked for two hours.''</p>
        <p>D'Alessandro said they found more common ground than he had expected. Several months later, Hancock renewed its I.O.C. sponsorship for the Sydney Games and then committed to spend as much as $15 million to advertise on NBC.</p>
        <p>That strain of pragmatism and getting what he wants are themes throughout Ebersol's tenure at NBC Sports. This is his second go-round at NBC; in 1975, he helped create ''Saturday Night Live,'' and he produced it from 1981 to 1985.</p>
        <p>He left to become an independent producer, creating shows like ''Friday Night Videos,'' ''Later with Bob Costas'' and ''Saturday Night's Main Event,'' in partnership with the World Wrestling Federation.</p>
        <p>Arledge recalled Ebersol's return to NBC as president of NBC Sports in 1989. ''Everybody thought he was a politician, including their top people,'' Arledge said. ''I said, 'Wait till you see him in action.' He is a bit of a politician, which is part of the job of getting rights.''</p>
        <p>In June 1995 Ebersol publicly savaged Major League Baseball for the collapse of the Baseball Network, a joint venture of NBC, ABC and baseball, and vowed not to make another deal with the leaders of the sport until the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Yet four months later, he sat in a box seat at the World Series beside Bud Selig, then baseball's interim commissioner, discussing a new deal. Ebersol admitted afterward that Welch, the G.E. chairman, told him to ''get over your extreme displeasure'' and pursue a new contract.</p>
        <p>Selig recalled that time. ''The more we talked,'' he said, ''the more we talked about history, and in the end, Dick is a very reasonable, very decent person.'' They agreed to a five-year deal worth $400 million.</p>
        <p>And in 1998, when he decided that the National Football League was demanding too much from NBC for its rights, Ebersol pursued ''Monday Night Football.'' When that failed, he tried to create a new football league with Turner Sports. When that died, he teamed up in March with the W.W.F. to form a new spring football league, the XFL, which he said would be legitimate despite its pedigree.</p>
        <p>Throughout his tenure at NBC Sports, Ebersol's closeness to Welch and Bob Wright, the president of NBC, has enabled him to make quicker financial decisions than his competitors.</p>
        <p>''He's willing to take risks,'' said Neal Pilson, an industry consultant who once competed against Ebersol as the president of CBS Sports. ''Welch and Wright believe in him. He's earned their respect. It took courage to chase the Olympics, and frankly I think he made a terrific deal for NBC.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps his most pragmatic maneuver will be on view from Sydney: the Olympics on basic cable. MSNBC and CNBC will carry 171 original hours of Olympic coverage, featuring sports that NBC has ignored in the past, like soccer, softball, boxing, weight lifting and wrestling.</p>
        <p>''We had CNBC, and MSNBC was still America's Talking, and I thought, we could do this,'' Ebersol said. ''I didn't check with anyone, I just told Samaranch we'd commit to X hours.''</p>
