        <p>In a country  where there are but two sports  soccer, and everything else -- Russians were positively glowing with pride today over the athletic prowess of 20-year-old Marat Safin.</p>
        <p>This, even though he practices a third-tier sport, tennis, in which the only physical contact is between a racquet and a ball. And even though he is an ethnic Tatar, a people often derided here -- a millennium after the fact, to boot -- as Attila the Hun's henchmen. And even though he and his family left Russia four years ago to live and play tennis in the sunnier climes of Valencia, Spain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safin's accomplishment far outweighed any imagined negatives. On Sunday, he became the first Russian ever to win the United States Open. Better still, he did it by demolishing the reigning American champion of world tennis, Pete Sampras, in straight sets.</p>
        <p>It would be wrong to say Russians bear the average American any great ill will. On the other hand, it would be just as wrong to say Russians have not been itching for the opportunity to show that they are as good as the so-called sole remaining superpower, particularly after a devastating August of submarine sinkings, flaming television towers and stage whispers that the Russian bear can no longer manage his own affairs, much less the world's.</p>
        <p>And so President Vladimir V. Putin hailed ''a bright new star'' in the tennis firmament, and added, ''we are pound that today's victor is a Russian.'' Reporters trailed Mr. Safin to a New York nightclub to chronicle his early-morning victory celebration. And this evening, the young tennis star's New York triumph -- and his $800,000 first prize -- led all three network newscasts.</p>
        <p>''On behalf of all Russians, we will be your fans,'' cooed an anchorwoman on ORT, Russian Public Television, at the end of a telephone interview on the 8 p.m. news.</p>
        <p>''We're happy to have such young men being so optimistic,'' chimed her male co-anchor.</p>
        <p>A reporter for NTV, a competing network, cheered, ''The first Russian who is the U.S. champion!'' and then deadpanned, ''Nobody heard anything from Marat that he wanted to change citizenship.''</p>
        <p>Although his parents moved him to Spain in 1996, where he established a base for his tennis career, there seems little doubt in Mr. Safin's mind today of where his roots lie. He is no stranger to Moscow, his hometown, where he has occasionally been spotted at stylish nightclubs.</p>
        <p>When a reporter for the newspaper  Izvestia tracked him down before sunrise on Monday in a New York disco -- drinking celebratory beer, not vodka -- the new Open champion credited much of his victory to the counsel of Aleksandr V. Volkov, the Russian tennis star who had earlier made it to the Open semifinals.</p>
        <p>And he made it clear that his next stop, before flying to Sydney and a spot on the Russian tennis team in the summer Olympics, would be Tashkent, Uzbekistan, a former Soviet country where he had committed himself to friends to play in a decidedly lower-rung tournament.</p>
        <p>The nation seemed to return the embrace. From the top down, Russia -- and its Soviet predecessor -- have long pigeonholed people by religion and ethnicity beyond what most Westerners would consider acceptable. Tatars and Caucasians, usually Muslim, usually darker-skinned people, have borne the brunt of discrimination, and Mr. Safin's name marks him as being of Tatar descent.</p>
        <p>But today, news accounts did not identify the new tennis sensation as a ''Rusian,'' the term applied to Russian citizens who are not necessarily Slavs, but instead as a ''Russki,'' the label usually reserved for Russia's majority Slavic population.</p>
        <p>At least one Russian Internet chat site noted sarcastically tonight that the Soviet government once conferred the same appellation on another Tatar who gained world-class status in his field, Rudolf Nureyev.</p>
        <p>But in an age when Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan have made race an afterthought in sports, it was unclear whether Russians were appropriating a Tatar achievement or the achiever himself as their own.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps, as Labor Minister Aleksandr Pochinok observed, all Russia has a more powerful reason to celebrate Mr. Safin's victory. Not only has a major new force in tennis surfaced in Russia, he told the newsradio station Echo Moskvy -- but ''a major new taxpayer'' has arrived, too.</p>
