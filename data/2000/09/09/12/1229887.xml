        <p>NEWS  Brush Strokes</p>
        <p>In the fourth century Wang Xizhi (303-361) transformed writing into art. Grace, elegance, complexity, experimentation and the full spectrum of the inner life of mankind are to be found in Chinese calligraphy as it has evolved across the millennia. In China calligraphy is regarded as the quintessential visual art, superior to painting as a vehicle for individual expression. Beginning on Friday an exhibition of this art will be on view through Jan. 7 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Consisting of some 120 works, ''The Embodied Image'' includes loans from six private collections and more than 55 masterworks from the two principal collections of Chinese calligraphy in the United States, the John B. Elliott Collection of the Art Museum at Princeton University and the Metropolitan Museum's own holdings.</p>

        <p>NEWS  Brush Strokes</p>
        <p>In the fourth century Wang Xizhi (303-361) transformed writing into art. Grace, elegance, complexity, experimentation and the full spectrum of the inner life of mankind are to be found in Chinese calligraphy as it has evolved across the millennia. In China calligraphy is regarded as the quintessential visual art, superior to painting as a vehicle for individual expression. Beginning on Friday an exhibition of this art will be on view through Jan. 7 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Consisting of some 120 works, ''The Embodied Image'' includes loans from six private collections and more than 55 masterworks from the two principal collections of Chinese calligraphy in the United States, the John B. Elliott Collection of the Art Museum at Princeton University and the Metropolitan Museum's own holdings.</p>
        <p>Shaping the City</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, from 1913 to 1930, it was, at 55 stories, the tallest building in the world. To this day the Woolworth Building towers above City Hall Park. Its architect was Cass Gilbert, Ohio born, Minnesota reared, who studied briefly at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked for McKim, Mead &amp; White for $20 a week before establishing his own office. Starting today his achievements will be examined at the New-York Historical Society. ''Inventing the Skyline: The Architecture of Cass Gilbert'' continues through Jan. 21.</p>
        <p>Season</p>
        <p>A new chapter of a history that began with their debut at the White House for Jimmy Carter's inauguration in 1977 will be written at 8 tonight and tomorrow, when the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio opens the 26th season of Chamber Music at the Y. At the 92nd Street Y Tisch Center for the Arts the trio will perform works by Mozart, Brahms and Richard Danielpour.</p>
        <p>Coming Attractions</p>
        <p>This year, New York. Next year, Washington. That's the word from the acclaimed Almeida Theater of London, which is currently displaying its art at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with Jonathan Kent's stagings of Shakespeare's ''Richard II'' and ''Coriolanus,'' starring Ralph Fiennes. In March at the Old Vic in London, Mr. Kent will direct a new version of the German dramatist Frank Wedekind's ''Lulu.'' In June and July Mr. Kent will take ''Lulu'' to the Kennedy Center.</p>
