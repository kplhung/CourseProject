        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>STUMP AROUND THE CLOCK -- Vice President Al Gore is planning a round-the-clock Labor Day tour of several battleground states to emphasize the ticket's dedication to workers. Mr. Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, his running mate, start on Sunday in Philadelphia, where they will meet with construction workers, then they fly to Flint, Mich., for an 11 p.m. visit with hospital workers. Next, they are off to Tampa, Fla., for a 5 a.m. visit to a diner and breakfast with firefighters. The two split at that point, with Mr. Gore flying to Pittsburgh for an afternoon Labor Day rally, which will include John Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Mr. Lieberman breaks off for Detroit. Mr. Gore and his entourage move on to Louisville for a night rally at the Louisville Motor Speedway.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>SHOO-INS IN FLORIDA -- Florida holds a Senate primary on Tuesday, but the outcome is not in doubt: Bill Nelson, a Democrat, and Representative Bill McCollum, a Republican, should trounce unknown challengers to move on to the general election with an independent candidate, Willie Logan, a state legislator. Neither Mr. Nelson, the state insurance commissioner, nor Mr. McCollum appears particularly nervous. Mr. Nelson goes into the fall campaign with a double-digit lead in public opinion polls and a $1 million financial edge, prompting Democrats to rate this race as a top opportunity to pick up the Republican seat now held by Senator Connie Mack, who is retiring. The combative tone of the campaign is certain to strain the relationship between the two men, who had sleepovers during their days in high school government and represented adjoining Congressional districts. They have something else in common -- Bill is neither's first name. Mr. McCollum is actually Ira William while Mr. Nelson is Clarence William. ''It's Ira vs. Clarence,'' said one campaign aide.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>FIGHT OVER FIREARMS -- Gun-control opponents have filed suit in Colorado in an effort to block a November ballot initiative that would require criminal checks on all buyers at gun shows, a move inspired by last year's massacre at Columbine High School. Currently, federally licensed dealers must conduct checks at gun shows but other sellers need not, an exemption that gun control supporters contend allows criminals or underage youth, like the Columbine gunmen, to buy weapons. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday by a group called Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, says that thousands of the signatures that helped put the initiative on the ballot were invalid because they were gathered before the Colorado Supreme Court approved the wording of the initiative. The initiative was sponsored by a Colorado group called Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic, formed after the Columbine incident. The gun owners group, which is the largest in Colorado, argues that the initiative, if passed, would violate the constitutional right to own a gun.</p>
