        <p>Senator Joseph I. Lieberman returned to the warm embrace of his hometown today, where he criticized Gov. George W. Bush, telling a group of older residents that Mr. Bush would do nothing to strengthen Medicare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman, joined by family members, was welcomed like a returning son to the Bella Vista retirement home here as he made his first swing through Connecticut since accepting the nomination as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>Looking drawn at the end of a six-day, cross-country campaign trip, Mr. Lieberman hoisted his 3-year-old granddaughter, Tennessee, onto his hip -- the first time in weeks he had seen her. He kissed her cheek and said, ''This is what I missed.''</p>
        <p>Millie Shea, 76, kissed the senator's cheek, shook his hand and then said: ''I'm praying for you all the time. I know God is with you.''</p>
        <p>Mary Casotti, 82, told him that when he was nominated, ''I nearly fainted with joy.''</p>
        <p>To the knowing nods of some 300 residents who crowded into a sweltering community room, Mr. Lieberman talked of meeting a retired veteran this week in Portland, Ore., who must spend a third of his income on medication.</p>
        <p>''That's unacceptable,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''In the greatest country in the world, at the time of our greatest prosperity in history, no one in this generation in particular, who survived the Depression, fought the Second World War, should have to face poverty to take the medicine that your doctors tell you you're supposed to take to stay well.''</p>
        <p>He praised Mr. Gore's proposal to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare, at a cost of more than $250 billion over 10 years, and to set aside some of the federal budget surplus to extend Medicare's solvency.</p>
        <p>''Our opponents can't do it because they won't have any money left after they've given it all away in a big tax cut'' that benefits mostly the wealthy, he said.</p>
        <p>And he cited the words of a Republican, Senator John McCain of Arizona, who criticized Mr. Bush's fiscal plan during the primaries.</p>
        <p>''He said the Bush plan doesn't have one penny for Social Security, one penny for Medicare or one penny to pay down the debt,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''He was right when he said it earlier this year, he's right today and he'll be right on Election Day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said last week that he would propose a prescription drug plan under Medicare this week, and he has argued that the surplus would be large enough to accommodate that goal and his tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''Senator Lieberman has his facts all wrong,'' said Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. ''Governor Bush dedicates 240 trillion pennies to Medicare. His budget doubles Medicare funding over the next 10 years.''</p>
        <p>The governor's tax cut, Mr. Bartlett said, ''is not only within the budget, it's good economic policy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has proposed an across-the-board tax cut that would total $1.3 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Gore has proposed a more modest $500 billion package of tax cuts singling out specific areas, like college tuition, child care and care for the elderly.</p>
        <p>The vice president has proposed using the rest of the projected budget surplus to shore up Social Security and Medicare, the health insurance program for the poor, and to pay down the national debt.</p>
        <p>Though he is popular among voters in Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman's visit came with a hint of controversy. He is running not only for vice president but also for a third term in the Senate, which would leave the seat in Republican hands if he and Mr. Gore win because Connecticut's governor, a Republican, would appoint his replacement.</p>
        <p>That has caused some grumbling among Connecticut Democrats, though most insisted publicly that they supported his decision. On Thursday, the Connecticut secretary of the state, Susan Bysiewicz, a Democrat, said in an interview on WVIT-TV that Mr. Lieberman should give up his Senate seat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman had said for weeks that he expected to run for re-election, and his aides have said it more forcefully. But it was not until Thursday night that the senator himself said definitively, ''I'm staying in the race.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut is one of a handful of states that allows a senator to run simultaneously for re-election and for national office, and his decision is not without precedent. Lloyd M. Bentsen, in 1988, and Lyndon B. Johnson, in 1960, both Texas Democrats, ran for re-election to the Senate while also running for vice president.</p>
        <p>But if the Democrats hold onto the White House, Mr. Lieberman would have to give up his Senate seat, and Gov. John G. Rowland would appoint his replacement. Republicans hold a 54-to-46 advantage in the Senate, and the loss of Mr. Lieberman's seat would hurt the Democrats' slim chances of taking control.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Lieberman quit the Senate race, officials in both parties said, any number of prominent Democrats, including Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, could step in and defeat the Republican nominee, Phillip A. Giordano, mayor of Waterbury.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal said today that he agreed with Mr. Lieberman's decision. ''I believe it is absolutely the right decision for the citizens of Connecticut,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman said that at this late date, the selection of a candidate to replace him would be made by party leaders and not by voters, and he argued that the process would be undemocratic.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lieberman began his day with a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser in Portland, Me., where he warned for the first time of the threat posed by Ralph Nader, the Green Party candidate for president.</p>
        <p>''A vote for Nader is a vote for Bush,'' he told about 15 contributors. But he noted of Mr. Nader's standing in the polls, ''I wouldn't say it has collapsed.'' Most polls have Mr. Nader with about 3 percent of the vote.</p>
