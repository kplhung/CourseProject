        <p>It may be nothing more than a coach's challenge or a motivational tweak.</p>
        <p>''Of all the teams in the N.F.L., we have the most question marks,'' Jim Fassel told the Giants this week. ''The guys that are the question marks are the guys that are driving the train.''</p>
        <p>Fassel knows that beginning Sunday against Arizona, he will be watched closely. The Giants were 7-9 last season, lost their last three games and missed the playoffs for the second straight year. His team is worthy of a standardized test, with nearly every position having been changed. Fassel listed the quarterback, offensive line, defensive line, linebackers and secondary as areas of concern.</p>
        <p>''Those are big questions, and I feel good about all of them,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>Fassel did not name his running backs, but even they present a new wrinkle. Ron Dayne, a bruising rookie, and the incumbent, Tiki Barber, a slicing ball carrier equally dangerous as a pass catcher, give Fassel two players with distinctive skills. Fassel named both as starters this week and expects each to get 20 to 25 touches of the ball.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Kerry Collins may be the least of Fassel's worries. Collins finally has job security with no personal controversy. He had a standout preseason, completing 44 of 72 passes for 531 yards and 3 touchdowns. Collins must beware of sloppy mistakes on short-yardage situations.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel like a question mark,'' Collins said. ''I don't want to put words in people's mouths but I don't think anybody in this locker room thinks I'm a question mark. But based on what has happened the last couple of years, it's justified."</p>
        <p>Fassel probably had to list Jason Sehorn as a question mark after the cornerback missed most of the last two seasons with injuries. But Sehorn also had a strong camp and appears capable of repeating his standout 1997 season.</p>
        <p>''It's a far assessment to say it's an unanswered question,'' Sehorn said.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, the questions become legitimate and the answers less obvious. Defensive end Michael Strahan watched his sacks drop to 5.5 last season from 15 in 1998. He and linebacker Mike Barrow, who was acquired as a free agent, are expected to increase the pressure on opposing quarterbacks, something Fassel said the defense lacked in the preseason.</p>
        <p>Beyond Sehorn, the secondary is untested. Dave Thomas was repeatedly picked on during the preseason and free safety Shaun Williams, who missed all four exhibition games with a sprained big left toe, will start his first N.F.L. game on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Giants are 3-0 on opening day under Fassel but only 3-9 in Weeks 2 through 5.</p>
        <p>Their only other home game in the next five weeks is Sept. 24 against Washington, arguably the best team in the league. The Giants lost twice to Arizona last season.</p>
        <p>Arizona wide receiver Rob Moore, who tore ligaments in his left knee during the preseason, and cornerback J. J. McCleskey, who broke his right ankle, are most likely out for the season. And although the Cardinals will be short-handed on the defensive line -- end Andre Wadsworth (knee) and tackle Rashod Swinger (knee) are out, and end Simeon Rice is holding out in a contract dispute -- Fassel has told his players not to take the Cardinals lightly.</p>
        <p>Even quarterback Jake Plummer skipped Arizona's final preseason game, with a sore shoulder, but he and Coach Vince Tobin say he will be fine come Sunday.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>RON DAYNE called the National Collegiate Athletic Association's decision to suspend 26 Wisconsin football players for receiving unadvertised discounts at an off-campus shoe store unfair. Dayne, who starred at Wisconsin and was the N.C.A.A.'s career rushing leader, said the association ''said it was O.K.'' for players to accept the discounts. N.C.A.A. officials were not available for comment. Dayne said the store gave the unadvertised discounts to ''anybody that came'' in the store, not just athletes. The Capital Times of Madison, Wis., reported on July 11 that Dayne received discounts and still owed the store $175. Dayne told The Associated Press that day that he never ran up a line of credit at the store and that he or an uncle paid his bills after each visit. With 11 players serving suspensions Thursday, Wisconsin beat Western Michigan, 19-7. . . . The rookie RON DIXON returned to practice with a specially fitted shoe. He had not practiced since a teammate stepped on his right foot Wednesday, cutting his heel. Dixon was still limping Friday, but Coach JIM FASSEL said he would play Sunday. Dixon is expected to return kicks and be the fourth wide receiver. . . . Linebacker MIKE BARROW collided with safety SHAUN WILLIAMS during practice and limped off the field, but he returned several plays later. Fassel said Barrow was fine.</p>
