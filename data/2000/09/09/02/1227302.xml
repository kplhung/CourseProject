        <p>NO. 3 ALABAMA 0-0 at U.C.L.A. 0-0  Alabama, the Southeastern Conference's Western Division favorite, has talent to burn. Freddie Milons, its flanker/running back/trick-play quarterback, and Shaun Bohanon, its new tailback, will test U.C.L.A.'s improved defense. Alabama is favored, but U.C.L.A. could be tough.TV: CH7, 3:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 22 SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI 0-0 NO. 13at TENNESSEE 0-0  With sophomore Joey Mathews succeeding Tee Martin at quarterback, Tennessee is a division favorite in the Southeastern Conference. If Southern Mississippi survives openers at Tennessee and Alabama, it will be a national power. TV: ESPN, 7:30 P.M.</p>

If Southern Mississippi survives openers at Tennessee and Alabama, it will be a national power. TV: ESPN, 7:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 23 COLORADO 0-0 vs. COLORADO STATE (at Denver) 0-0  Colorado has the edge against a dangerous rival. It needs a good start because its next five opponents are Southern California, Washington, Kansas State, Texas A&amp;M and Texas.TV: ESPN, 6 P.M.</p>
        <p>OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>EAST  Toledo (0-0) at Penn State (0-1)  Penn State's defense is no longer overwhelming, and the Nittany Lions rushed for only 6 yards against Southern Cal.  TV: ESPN2, Noon.</p>
        <p>Villanova (0-0) at Rutgers (0-0)  Rutgers, 1-10 last year, is worried about its offensive line.</p>
        <p>Boston College (0-0) at West Virginia (0-0)  Both teams are unhappy having to start the season with a Big East game.  TV: ESPN, Noon.</p>
        <p>SOUTH  Tulane (0-0) at No. 18 Mississippi (0-0)  Ole Miss can go a long way behind Deuce McAllister, a fast and punishing runner.</p>
        <p>New Mexico State (0-0) at South Carolina (0-0)  A chance for Lou Holtz to win a game at South Carolina after last year's 0-11 nightmare.</p>
        <p>MIDWEST  Louisiana Tech (0-0) at No. 8 Kansas State (1-0)  Kansas State beat Iowa last weekend with a decent defense and a ragged offense.</p>
        <p>No. 25 Texas A&amp;M (0-0) at Notre Dame (0-0)  Mark Farris, the Aggies' new quarterback, is 25, with five years of minor league baseball behind him. Notre Dame faces another testing season.  TV: CH4, 1:00 P.M.</p>
        <p>Army (0-0) at Cincinnati (0-0) On Monday, after 15 seasons of the wishbone, Army, which lived by the run, unveils a quick-pass offense.</p>
        <p>SOUTHWEST  Texas-El Paso (0-0) at No. 19 Oklahoma (0-0)  Oklahoma has good passing, good defense and a friendly schedule except for Texas, Kansas State and Nebraska in a row in midseason.</p>
        <p>FAR WEST  Idaho (0-0) at No. 14 Washington (0-0)  If Marques Tuiasosopo's passing holds up, Washington will survive despite a questionable defense.</p>
        <p>MISMATCHES  San Jose State (0-0) at No. 1 Nebraska (0-0)  San Jose State, 3-7 last year, is a seven-touchdown underdog against the national-champion favorite. Is this game necessary?</p>
        <p>Bowling Green (0-0) at No. 6 Michigan (0-0)  John Navarre, a 6-6 sophomore, will be Michigan's quarterback because Drew Henson is out six weeks with a broken right foot.</p>
        <p>Ball State (0-0) at No. 9 Florida (0-0)  Florida hopes to uncover its customary game-breaking receivers.</p>
        <p>Akron (0-0) at No. 11 Virginia Tech (0-0)  Tech's scheduled opener against Georgia Tech last Sunday was wiped out by a lightning storm.</p>
        <p>Central Michigan (0-0) at No. 15 Purdue (0-0)  Drew Brees can pass, but when the opposition gets tough, will Purdue find a running game?</p>
        <p>Buffalo (0-0) at Syracuse (0-0)  Syracuse won't announce its quarterback until game time. It will probably be sophomore Troy Nunes.</p>
