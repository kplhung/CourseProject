        <p>A Pakistani military contingent landed on American shores last week and marched up Madison Avenue. Then part of it disappeared.</p>
        <p>The incident was front-page news in the city's Pakistani press -- seven or eight members of an army pipe and drum band who came to New York for last Sunday's Pakistani Independence Day Parade fleeing, as one Pakistani newspaper put it, ''in the darkness of night from their boarding place in Brooklyn, New York.'' What they left behind were a few phone numbers found on a host's caller I.D. box and a string of embarrassed officials stretching from Pakistan to New York to Washington and back.</p>
        <p>A local Urdu-language paper, Sada-E-Pakistan, headlined a photograph of the remaining members of the band, dressed in white shirts with matching dark vests and dining at a Brooklyn restaurant, with an equation: ''35 - 7 = 28.'' The math is clear, but the story is anything but. With Pakistan's ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, about to visit for the United Nations' Millennium Summit next week, the AWOL bagpipers have engendered a string of denials and recriminations.</p>
        <p>Asked about the band on the run, a spokeswoman for Pakistan's mission to the United Nations recommended calling the Pakistan Consulate. The consulate said to call the embassy in Washington. The embassy, whose spokesmen said they were too busy to give their names, suggested calling the consulate. All said they knew nothing about the army band's visit.</p>
        <p>Two Pakistani officials visiting New York for the United Nations event said they were not sure what had happened. Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, the director general of the army's information services, and Javed Jabbar, the federal minister for information and media development, said that they would gather details and call back yesterday, but they did not.</p>
        <p>It was not even clear whether all of the band members were members of the military. Major General Qureshi said some of them were civilians.</p>
        <p>Among the organizers of the parade, the story is no less murky. While Munir Lodhi, the chairman of the parade committee, was quoted in Sada-E-Pakistan saying that the missing band members would be found and returned, Tariq Khokar, the committee's general secretary, told The New York Times that ''these band members are not missing. Not at all.''</p>
        <p>''This is a nonsense story, making my country look bad, making my army look bad,'' Mr. Khokar said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lodhi has referred all questions to Mr. Khokar.</p>
        <p>The band was the first such military contingent from Pakistan to visit the United States, a Pakistan army official said. And the sight of the pipers, wearing stiff uniforms crowned with vividly striped epaulets and caps and accompanied by a troupe of sword dancers, had Sunday's paradegoers chanting ''Pakistan Zindabad!'' -- long live Pakistan.</p>
        <p>But on Monday, some of the band members failed to appear at a dinner in their honor at the Kashmir Restaurant in Midtown Manhattan, said Shaheen Khalid, the restaurant's owner. Mr. Khokar told him that they ''fell sick, or somehow there was some problem and they could not make it,'' Mr. Khalid said.</p>
        <p>But others at the dinner said that Mr. Khokar had appeared at the restaurant and questioned guests about the missing musicians' whereabouts. ''Everybody said, 'I don't know,' '' said Afzal Butt, who was at the dinner.</p>
        <p>Azid M. Mian, the United Nations bureau chief for the Jang Group, Pakistan's leading newspaper chain, said he, too, was at the dinner, and that Mr. Khokar had invited him to go to New Jersey to search a house there for the band members, but he refused.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the band -- or what was left of it -- dined at the Bukhara Restaurant on Coney Island Avenue  before its flight home from Kennedy  Airport.</p>
        <p>There, another band member fled the restaurant after going to the bathroom, said a manager who refused to give his name. The manager said the man was pursued, but not caught. It is unclear whether that man was the seventh or eighth deserter.</p>
        <p>Even the issue of where the band was staying is in dispute. Mr. Lodhi and Mr. Khokar said the 24 members, plus the 11 Khattak dancers who came with them, stayed at the homes of 5 parade trustees.</p>
        <p>But two of those trustees, Muzzafar Chaudry and Inayat Shaikh, denied that. Mr. Chaudry said that all the band members had stayed at the Brooklyn home of Latif Munawar Chaudry, another trustee. Mr. Chaudry could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mian, the first journalist to report the story, has since become something of a character in it, clearly relishing his investigative role. He went to the airport to see which band members boarded the departing plane, he said, and said he even warned an airline official to process the passengers as individuals rather than as a group. He said Mr. Khokar had asked him not to write about the defections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khokar, in turn, told a reporter that Mr. Mian was using his ''whole evil power'' to declaim the parade. He said that Mr. Mian had been arrested in Pakistan and had been involved in a scheme to embezzle port fees from the Pakistani government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mian denied those accusations, saying he was detained during the military coup staged by General Musharraf last October because he was the guest of a government minister who had been placed under house arrest. While detained, he wrote an article about his detention for the Jang group and was interviewed by telephone on ABC.</p>
        <p>The Pakistani Independence Day Parade has not been without controversy. Past organizers have been accused of using the parade as a cover to bring illegal Pakistani immigrants into the United States.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mian, who has written several additional articles since his first report, insisted that the band members, whom he presumed were on their first trip to the United States, must have had help navigating the city and finding shelter. With a touch of gravity, he said, ''This saga will unfold, what were the motives of this act, and who was responsible for this act.''</p>
