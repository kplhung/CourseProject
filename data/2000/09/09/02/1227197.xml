        <p>SARGENT-James O'Hara. Born August 3, 1962, died September 15, 2000. Beloved son of Clement Denny Sargent and Anne Sargent. Beloved brother and dear friend. He will be missed by all.</p>
        <p>SARGENT-James O. The employees of Rolex Watch USA mourn the loss of our good friend and colleague, Jim Sargent. His contributions to our company were many from the media world to his passion for racquet sports, skiing and equestrian events. He was, in short, the consummate professional. We will miss his friendship even more. His infectious laugh, gusto for life, his cartoons and poems on someone's birthday-these were the man we'll always remember. We will keep his family and many friends, who are hurting so much now, in our thoughts and prayers.</p>
        <p>SARGENT-James O. The Board of Directors of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association and all of our ITA coaches and players mourn the loss of a great friend of college tennis, who competed with outstanding success and sportsmanship at Lynchburg College, reaching the quarterfinals of the NCAA Championships and achieving ITA All-American status. Afterwards Jim continued as a special partner of college tennis in his role as Media Manager for Rolex Watch, U.S.A. The ITA wishes to extend its deepest sympathies and condolences to his family and friends. We will greatly miss him.</p>
