        <p>The Asia Development Bank said North Korea had applied for membership status, which would give it access to low-interest loans to rebuild its outdated infrastructure and feed its people. As part of its conciliatory gestures, South Korea has tried to help North Korea gain membership in the development bank. But the United States and Japan have opposed even observer status in the bank because of concerns about North Korea's sponsorship of terrorism. The development bank said North Korea's application had been referred to its shareholders.</p>
