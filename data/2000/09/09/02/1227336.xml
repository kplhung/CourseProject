        <p>Islanders defenseman Kenny Jonsson signed a one-year contract with the club yesterday. Terms were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>''We are happy that our captain is signed in time for training camp,'' Islanders General Manager Mike Milbury said. ''We're confident Kenny is going to play a vital role in our success this season.''</p>
        <p>Jonsson, 25, who became the team's eighth captain last September, averaged 24 minutes 35 seconds a game but missed 10 games with a concussion. He did not play the final five games of the season because of headaches, and finished with one goal and 24 assists in 65 games.</p>
        <p>The Islanders report to training camp next Friday.</p>
