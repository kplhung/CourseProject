        <p>The Eastern Pequot Indians, a Connecticut tribe seeking formal recognition by the federal government, have publicly acknowledged for the first time that they hope to build a casino as part of a larger ''world class'' resort.</p>
        <p>Until this week, the tribe had declined to discuss its economic development plans, although casino gambling is widely recognized as perhaps the most lucrative opportunity afforded by official recognition from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p>
        <p>The Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, and other local officials have opposed the Eastern Pequots' petition for tribal recognition, saying the tribe does not meet the required historical criteria.</p>
        <p>The tribe's interest in casino gambling was first reported Thursday in The Norwich Bulletin and confirmed yesterday in a statement issued by its council. The statement said the tribe hoped to develop ''a tourism-based family resort'' in partnership with a local municipality.</p>
        <p>''We will develop a plan that may include hotels, restaurants, entertainment and shopping, along with golf and other outdoor activities,'' the tribe's vice chairman, Mark Sebastian, said in the statement. ''Subject to the required federal and state approvals, we will also examine the feasibility of gaming as part of the concept.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal said yesterday that his office would continue to oppose recognition for the tribe, adding that the economic development plan was irrelevant to his position. ''We've asked probative and challenging questions about the merits of their petition based on factual and legal gaps that we see in their application.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal has repeatedly voiced opposition to recognition to  the Interior Department, which decides the matter. But an official at the Bureau of Indian Affairs, part of the department, has already issued a preliminary finding favoring recognition.</p>
        <p>Nancy Tyler, a spokeswoman for the Eastern Pequots, said the tribe was interested in finding a municipal partner for its economic development plans.</p>
        <p>The tribe shares a reservation in North Stonington, Conn., with the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 13, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Sept. 2 about the Eastern Pequot Indians' acknowledgment that they hope to build a casino if they receive formal recognition by the federal government misattributed a statement to them. It was another Connecticut tribe seeking recognition, the Paucatuck Eastern Pequots, that expressed gratitude to Donald J. Trump and his organization in March for supporting its efforts. The Eastern Pequots say they have had no dealings with Mr. Trump or his company.</p>
