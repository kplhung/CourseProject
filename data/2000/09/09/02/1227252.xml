        <p>Money has never put in much of an appearance in Mattoon.</p>
        <p>Folks eat in places like Gill's diner, circa 1940, where the all-you-can-eat walleye special (two sides included) goes for $4.99. They work at factories like the Lender's Bagel plant, sponsor of the annual Bagelfest, the town's biggest event.</p>
        <p>So more than a few eyebrows began arching when a handful of people in this small central Illinois town suddenly seemed to be sitting pretty. A deputy sheriff wound up with a new boat, a Harley-Davidson and numerous antique cars. A struggling construction contractor bought dozens of shiny new trucks.</p>
        <p>A retired electrician started offering people interest-free loans to build nice houses and start new businesses: the sparkly Bluebird Diner, Our Own Original Bakery, Jimmy John's Sandwich Shop, Auctions Buy Us.</p>
        <p>At one point, rumor has it, the post office handled a package so full of cash that it actually burst at the seams.</p>
        <p>''When people start buying property with cash, opening businesses with cash, when they have only a job that pays minimum wage, well, then  you start to wonder,'' said Mayor Wanda Ferguson, a 65-year-old former donut shop worker.</p>
        <p>This week, federal law enforcement officials gave foundation to a few years of Mattoon gossip. They charged 11 Mattoon residents and 8 other people in a bogus financial investment scheme that, the authorities say, hoodwinked more than 10,000 people around the world out of more than $12.5 million. Most of those charged in Mattoon were longtime residents, including the deputy sheriff, a former police officer, a minister, a lawyer and businessmen.</p>
        <p>As prosecutors describe it in a 91-page indictment, the scheme was orchestrated by a 66-year-old retired electrician, Clyde D. Hood, who started a sham investment fund in 1994, representing himself as an international banker who had worked for several Fortune 500 companies. (In court on Thursday, Mr. Hood said he could not remember the names of the Fortune 500 companies but thought they were in ''the New York area or the Florida area, probably.'')</p>
        <p>The fund, called Omega Trust and Trading, promised a 50-to-1 return on each investment and couched its campaign in Christian terms, with phrases like ''keep the Lord's warehouse full.''</p>
        <p>Money flowed in from people in all 50 states and countries including China and Australia, prosecutors said, with some investors following quizzical instructions to wrap their cash contributions in tin foil.</p>
        <p>In Mattoon, prosecutors say, Mr. Hood laundered the money by setting up businesses with acquaintances or giving them interest-free loans to build upscale homes or buy cars.</p>
        <p>''It makes you feel bad, like I worked all my life and I'm driving this old truck,'' said Joe Utley, 56, a custodian at Washington Elementary School, who like many others in Mattoon, population 18,500, heard about the fountain of money but figured it was best to steer clear. ''You see all these buildings going up. Why are all these things happening here, where there is nothing much that goes on?''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the defendants, who face a variety of money laundering, conspiracy and fraud charges, say they are not guilty. Stephen R. Ryan, a lawyer for Mr. Hood, said the charges were ''based on misinformation and or misinterpretation of the information that they have.'' He declined to elaborate.</p>
        <p>In an especially odd aspect of the case, Mr. Hood and two of the other defendants have apparently tried to assert that the United States government does not exist. As a grand jury was convened, they mailed papers to prosecutors, court clerks, Mattoon police officers, the county sheriff and the United States Supreme Court stating that ''any judicial proceeding, determination, ruling, order, decree, entry, penalty, fine or arrest warrants which issues from these 'courts' is null and void.''</p>
        <p>Investigators also found identity cards with pictures and signatures of Mr. Hood and another defendant, Arlene Foust Diamond, a 63-year-old real estate and insurance agent from Los Angeles, who solicited investments for Omega. The cards identified Mr. Hood and Ms. Diamond as ''ambassador and minister of justice for the Free State of Eden.'' Prosecutors said Ms. Diamond tried to use her card to claim a kind of diplomatic immunity and get out of submitting handwriting and fingerprint samples to the grand jury. Mr. Hood testified in court on Thursday that he signed the card as a joke.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said that they had found bank accounts for Mr. Hood and Ms. Diamond in Dubai, and accounts for Ms. Diamond in Belize and other countries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hood and his wife, Patricia Ann Hood, 64, are also charged with filing false tax returns. According to the indictment, the Hoods claimed only $9,919 in total income for 1995 and $11,222 in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hood, a big man with leathery skin, pleaded guilty to criminal damage of property and burglary in two separate cases in the 1970's. Born and reared in Mattoon, he worked for various factories, farmed and fixed radiators.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Hood represented himself to Omega investors as ''one of only seven or eight persons worldwide who had the knowledge, expertise and capability to conduct these secret multimillion-dollar trades,'' the United States attorney's office said.</p>
        <p>In February, the Securities and Exchange Commission warned investors not to participate in schemes in which con artists exploit suspicions about the government and financial institutions. The schemers tell investors that there is a secret banking system open only to the very rich and providing huge returns but that they can participate if they pool their money with someone who has an ''in.''</p>
        <p>In the Mattoon case, investors in all 50 states and a dozen countries sent cashier's checks and money orders after being told that the money would be invested in foreign bank debentures, prosecutors say. They were promised that each $100 would net them $5,100 in 275 days, and that if they ''rolled over'' the $5,100, they would receive $255,000.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say that for years, Mr. Hood had an investor phone line with recorded messages saying the payoff was just around the corner and blaming the delay on bankers or the government.</p>
        <p>Omega investors never made any money, prosecutors say.</p>
        <p>Linda Stark, of Apple Valley, Calif., said she invested $1,600 in 1998 and thought she would receive $5,100 for every $100 in two months. Ms. Stark said she knew about 20 other investors, most of them Christians like her.</p>
        <p>''I hold no animosity,'' she said of Mr. Hood and Ms. Diamond. ''It saddens me they have to sit in jail. Their lives are spoiled by their greed.''</p>
        <p>In Mattoon, people watched the sprouting of places like the Bluebird Diner, made from three shiny silver trailers. ''When they built the Bluebird Diner, we thought they must have been doing better than we thought,'' said Shelli Kaczmarek, a manager at Gill's. ''Me, my husband and 3-year-old paid $20 there for breakfast. I can feed my whole family, all four of my kids, on that here.''</p>
        <p>Stuart Chris Engel, a construction contractor whose business is accused of funneling $6 million of Mr. Hood's money, prospered overnight.</p>
        <p>''We're not like New York, where a construction company with a fleet of 40 or 50 new vehicles'' could suddenly flourish and ''people probably wouldn't think that much about it,'' the police chief, David O'Dell, said. ''We're a small town. It was just obvious.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone in Mattoon has come down hard on Mr. Hood and his accused co-conspirators.</p>
        <p>Melissa Yates, a secretary at Our Own Original Bakery, which never became a bakery but served as Mr. Hood's office, said, ''All I know is that he has done a lot for this community. He has helped hundreds of people around here, even strangers.''</p>
