        <p>The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton arrived here this afternoon for what was supposed to be a weekend of fund-raising, campaigning and relaxing in the Finger Lakes. But the White House announced that the Clintons would return to Washington on Saturday night, a day earlier than planned, to care for their daughter, Chelsea, who was said to be suffering from a cold.</p>
        <p>The Clintons' decision to scale back their Labor Day weekend plans came as The Associated Press reported that the builder who lent them a lakefront vacation house this year and last year was the subject of a 10-month-old warrant by the New York State Tax Department seeking $938,357 in taxes, penalties and interest in 1997.</p>
        <p>The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the tax problems of Thomas B. McDonald, the Clintons' weekend host, played no role in their decision. He said the White House knew of Mr. McDonald's tax liability when the Clintons used his house last summer.</p>
        <p>''This is someone they like very much, and he is working to resolve the issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart said that Chelsea Clinton, who had just finished trips to Africa and Colombia, was suffering from fatigue and a bad cold, and that the Clintons wanted to spend as much of the holiday weekend with her as possible.</p>
        <p>Although White House and Clinton campaign aides insisted that the change in plans had nothing to do with Mr. McDonald, the Associated Press report detracted from what was likely to be the easiest weekend Mrs. Clinton would enjoy between now and Election Day. With evident glee, aides to Mrs. Clinton's opponent in the United States Senate race, Rick A. Lazio, moved to draw attention to the report almost the moment it moved on the wires.</p>
        <p>''I guess this is what Hillary Clinton means when she says she supports targeted tax cuts for the middle class,'' said Michael Marr, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's campaign responded by citing a news report of an instance in which a builder who contributed $5,000 to Mr. Lazio's campaign was in tax arrears. ''Rick Lazio should clean up his own house before throwing some more mud at Hillary Clinton,'' said Cathie Levine, a campaign spokeswoman. ''It seems that Mr. Lazio will do anything to avoid talking about the issues in this race.''</p>
        <p>The White House sent out an e-mail message on Thursday night announcing the Clintons' change of plans. The Associated Press report came out this afternoon.</p>
        <p>The warrant against Mr. McDonald was for 1997 taxes. It was filed on Nov. 1, 1999, according to Marc Carey, a spokesman for the tax department. Mr. McDonald could not be reached by telephone at his home this afternoon.</p>
        <p>His lawyer, Paul M. Predmore, said Mr. McDonald was trying to work out a plan to pay the back taxes. He said Mr. McDonald also owed federal taxes, but he would not say how much.</p>
        <p>Mr. Predmore attributed Mr. McDonald's debt to a failed real estate investment. He said 1997 was the only year for which Mr. McDonald owed taxes.</p>
        <p>The Clintons' change in plans appeared to cut more into time set aside for relaxing than politicking.</p>
        <p>The president and Mrs. Clinton went to a fund-raiser this evening -- a ''Dinosaur Barbecue'' -- with a menu that included pulled pork, spare ribs and chicken. Aides said the event would raise as much as $150,000 for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign.</p>
        <p>At the fund-raiser, Mr. Clinton emphasized one of his wife's main campaign themes as he credited her for playing a ''substantive, positive role in the work we have done over these past eight years.'' And he criticized Republicans for their attacks on his wife. ''Their campaign is basically trying to do reverse plastic surgery on her,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And the president spoke whimsically about his own years in office as he noted that he was going to be followed at the microphone by a magician. ''I want to see this,'' he said, ''I've spent eight years trying to be one.''</p>
        <p>A second fund-raiser is set for Saturday night.</p>
        <p>For the second year in a a row, the Clintons also planned to visit the New York State Fair. Mr. Lazio attended earlier this week.</p>
