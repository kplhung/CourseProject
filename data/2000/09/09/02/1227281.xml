        <p>Two generals long suspected of corruption have been arrested and imprisoned by the military on charges of collaborating with the Juarez drug cartel, prosecutors said today.</p>
        <p>The suspects are Gen. Francisco Quiroz Hermosillo, who retired from the army in July, and Brig. Gen. Mario Arturo Acosta Chaparro, a counterinsurgency expert with a reputation for repression who is on active duty.</p>
        <p>Their arrests on charges of drug trafficking and bribery on Thursday, on the eve of President Ernesto Zedillo's final State of the Union Address, were an additional blow to the reputation of the Mexican armed forces in their role as a narcotics enforcer.</p>
        <p>President-elect Vicente Fox Quesada, who takes office on Dec. 1, has promised to withdraw the military from the drug war after a decade in which the drug barons bought off the armed forces as much as the military fought the traffickers. The Constitution bars the military from any role other than national defense.</p>
        <p>The corruption at the highest levels became painfully apparent in 1997, when Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, appointed by President Zedillo as the first military figure to be the government's drug czar, was arrested on charges that he had been paid off by Amado Carrillo Fuentes, leader of the Juarez cartel.</p>
        <p>Though his American counterpart, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, had called General Gutierrez Rebollo ''a man with a reputation for impeccable integrity'' before his arrest, events proved otherwise. The general is now serving a 71-year prison sentence.</p>
        <p>One of the arrested officers, General Acosta Chaparro, has long been identified by Mexican human-rights organizations as involved in the repression and torture of leftists in the state of Guerrero. Army and police forces in Guerrero have spent years battling a small armed insurgency and a larger civilian movement that is seeking land rights and political freedom. The general has been a leader in counterinsurgency operations there, according to several authoritative military histories.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Virgilia Galeana Garcia, a human rights advocate, gave eyewitness testimony placing General Acosta Chaparro at the scene of one of Mexico's worst massacres.</p>
        <p>In the killings, which were videotaped, the state police ambushed, shot and killed 17 rural advocates at a roadblock in Aguas Blancas, not far from Acapulco, in June 1995. General Acosta Chaparro denied involvement in the massacre.</p>
        <p>General Quiroz Hermosillo retired in July as a director of Army health services. He had previously held high rank in the intelligence and military transport directorates.</p>
        <p>The generals were implicated by the testimony of at least three witnesses who are under government protection, according to military prosecutors. The prosecutors said the witnesses tied the generals to the Juarez drug cartel organized by Mr. Carrillo Fuentes, who died in 1997.</p>
        <p>General Acosta Chaparro's name is in the files of investigators from the United States and Switzerland who have spent years trying to trace connections between drug barons and the Mexican political and military elite, according to court records. Published Mexican documents dating from 1997 name him as being suspected of corruption.</p>
        <p>Other documents, from the attorney general's office, identify General Quiroz Hermosillo as a suspect. One military prosecutor, Rafael Macedo de la Concha, said both generals had been the targets of investigations since at least July 1999.</p>
