        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., struggling to cope with a large recall and strained relations with its biggest customer, received another blow today when federal regulators warned of safety problems in many Firestone tires sold as replacements for factory-issued tires on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today that Firestone had rebuffed a request from regulators on Thursday to broaden its current tire recall. The agency took the rare step today of issuing a ''consumer advisory'' suggesting that drivers buy new tires at their own expense anyway.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., struggling to cope with a large recall and strained relations with its biggest customer, received another blow today when federal regulators warned of safety problems in many Firestone tires sold as replacements for factory-issued tires on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today that Firestone had rebuffed a request from regulators on Thursday to broaden its current tire recall. The agency took the rare step today of issuing a ''consumer advisory'' suggesting that drivers buy new tires at their own expense anyway.</p>
        <p>The agency said the advisory involved 1.4 million Firestone tires that were even more prone to failure than the tires recalled on Ford Explorers and other Ford models.</p>
        <p>The safety agency's review ''indicated that the rate of tread separations for certain other tire models and sizes exceed those of the recalled tires, sometimes by a large margin,'' the consumer advisory said. It added: ''We are continuing our investigation, which may result in an order directing Firestone to recall these tires and any other defective tires. However, in view of the potential safety risk, N.H.T.S.A. believes that it is important to alert the public of its concerns now.''</p>
        <p>Bridgestone/Firestone said in a statement that it disagreed with the agency's analysis of the data. But Firestone dealers will provide free inspections of tires and will, if customers insist, replace tires covered by the advisory with other Firestone tires, or with tires from other manufacturers, the statement said.</p>
        <p>Many Firestone dealers are already struggling to cope with thousands of owners of Ford Explorers and other sport utility vehicles who are still seeking replacements for tires covered by the recall on Aug. 9.</p>
        <p>The consumer advisory could cause considerable confusion at Firestone dealers and auto dealerships across the country over Labor Day weekend, and perhaps a lot of canceled road trips, as millions of Americans try to decide whether tires that they bought for their sport utility vehicles and pickups are covered by the regulators' warning.</p>
        <p>Determining whether a tire is covered by the advisory requires parking the vehicle on a level spot away from traffic and then crawling under it with a flashlight to read a code on the interior sidewall of each tire. The code must then be matched with a list issued today by the regulators.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company cited the advisory as evidence that scores of fatal crashes involving Explorers were a result of tire problems, not  vehicle defects.</p>
        <p>Ford has said that it alerted Firestone to problems in Venezuela in October 1998.</p>
        <p>Arizona state officials said in interviews today that they had contacted Firestone in the summer of 1996. Robert Descheemaker, the commodities unit administrator of the state's purchasing office, sent a letter to Firestone on July 22, 1996, warning that tread separations on Firestone light truck tires had caused two crashes. ''This becomes a great concern since apparently the defect causes separation due to the high heat,'' said the letter, which Mr. Descheemaker supplied today. Firestone sent experts out to examine the tires and ended up sending some of the tires back to its research laboratories for analysis in early 1997, Mr. Descheemaker said.</p>
        <p>Firestone concluded that the tires had been improperly maintained, Mr. Descheemaker said. The tire maker continues to take that position  about many of the crashes that have occurred. Catherine Babonis, the bureau chief for support services in the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said that the department had received some credits from Firestone for new tires.</p>
        <p>Cynthia McCafferty, a Firestone spokeswoman, said that while she was not aware of the company's dealings with Arizona officials, Firestone tried to satisfy all customers with concerns.</p>
        <p>Today's consumer advisory is the strongest action that the government can take if it has some indications of a problem but lacks the extensive body of engineering and statistical analysis needed to justify forcing a company to carry out a recall against its will.</p>
        <p>While the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration frequently issued such advisories in the 1970's, it has seldom done so since then except in a few cases involving child safety seats, said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group.</p>
        <p>The safety agency's staff and budget were cut in half at the beginning of the Reagan administration, as part of an effort to reduce the weight of government regulation on businesses, and the agency has never regained the size and influence it had in the Carter administration.</p>
        <p>Most of the replacement tires listed in today's advisory have the letters ''LT'' in their code. This means that they are light truck tires, often designed for off-road use, and are not passenger car tires, which have the designation ''P'' in their code. Light truck tires have been subject to different regulations from car tires since the 1960's. The light truck tires are designed to carry more weight but are not designed to be driven as fast as car tires.</p>
        <p>Stephen R. Kratzke, the safety agency's associate administrator, said in an interview two weeks ago that the government tested light truck tires at a top speed of 80 miles an hour, compared with 85 miles an hour in the car test. The government is considering a requirement that light truck tires meet the same standards as car tires, he said.</p>
        <p>All of the tires covered by the recall on Aug. 9 were passenger car tires, which can be used on sport utilities and pickups that are mostly driven on paved roads.</p>
        <p>Some tires listed in today's advisory were original equipment on sport utility vehicles. Regulators said these included some tires on 1991 Chevrolet Blazers, 1991 to 1994 Nissan pickup trucks and 1996 to 1998 Ford F-150 pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>G.M. said that fewer than 10,000 of the 211,450 Blazers it sold in the 1991 model year had the tires cited in the advisory. These tires have an excellent safety record, said Brook Lindbert, G.M.'s director of wheels and tires. Of more than 1,400 complaints regulators have received about Firestone tires, only two involve 1991 Blazers, but one complaint said that a death occurred.</p>
        <p>Ford said that only 500 tires covered by the advisory had been installed at the factory on F-150 pickup trucks. Nissan said that fewer than 20,000 pickups had been equipped with tires mentioned in the advisory. G.M., Ford and Nissan all said that they would do whatever necessary to satisfy customers with complaints about factory-issued tires, including possibly replacing the tires.</p>
        <p>The recall on Aug. 9 covers 14.4 million 15-inch tires produced as original equipment for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks from 1991 until January of this year, but Ford and Firestone estimate that only 6.5 million of these tires are still in use.</p>
        <p>Today's consumer advisory said that many of the 1.4 million tires are probably no longer in use either.</p>
        <p>Most tires covered by the advisory were made in Decatur, Ill., a factory that Ford has cited as having quality problems. The Ford pickup tires in the advisory are P235/70R16 Wilderness tires, which means they have a 16-inch diameter. All tires covered by the recall are 15-inch tires, but plaintiffs' lawyers have called for 16-inch tires on Explorers and other sport utility vehicles to be included, and regulators have also been reviewing the 16-inch tires since they began their investigation in early May. Ford has repeatedly said the 16-inch tires are safe.</p>
