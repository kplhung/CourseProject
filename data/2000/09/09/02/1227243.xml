        <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, said today that if elected, he would forfeit stock options worth about $3.5 million in the energy services company that he left to run for office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney had been challenged by the Gore campaign for inviting a conflict of interest if he owned the options while in office. He was precluded from selling the options, which he was awarded for his service as chief executive of the Halliburton Company, until 2001 at the earliest, and their value by then would have been affected by the company's profits, which are sensitive to the price of oil and United States energy policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney released tax returns and financial disclosure forms today showing his income skyrocketing, from $258,394 in 1992, his last year as secretary of defense, to just over $2 million in 1993 and then to $4,423,289 in 1999.</p>
        <p>In a brief accompanying statement, Mr. Cheney said, ''In order to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest, I am fully prepared to forfeit any options that have not vested by the time I assume office.''</p>
        <p>If he had kept the stock options, any decision in a Bush-Cheney administration would have been scrutinized for whether it was helping Halliburton's stock price.</p>
        <p>The statement said that the forfeiture covered 3,000 previously unreported stock options in Procter and Gamble, a consumer products company, which also cannot be sold until after the next administration takes office. But the Procter and Gamble price is now below what it would cost him to exercise the options, so it is no loss to Mr. Cheney.</p>
        <p>Previously, Mr. Cheney had declined to make a pledge to forfeit his options, saying only that he would do whatever he must to avoid a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney's financial disclosures, required to be filed with the Federal Election Commission within 30 days of his nomination, also showed that when he was picked by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas as his running mate, Mr. Cheney received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Electronic Data Systems Corporation, and that his wife, Lynne, has been paid as a director of the  Lockheed Martin Corporation, a major defense contractor, since 1995.  Mr. Cheney was on the board of E.D.S. but resigned to run for vice president. E.D.S. which was founded by Ross Perot, was bought by General Motors in 1984 but was split off from G.M. in 1996.</p>
        <p>Explaining Mr. Cheney's decision to forgo the Halliburton options, his press secretary, Dirk Vande Beek, said that the vice-presidential candidate and his advisers had consulted with the Office of Government Ethics, which reviews the finances of federal officials, and with the Internal Revenue Service, and had determined that there was no way to turn the options over to charity.</p>
        <p>Therefore, Mr. Vande Beek said, Mr. Cheney ''will forfeit the unvested options.'' The value of the stock options depends upon the price when they are exercised, but for example, if Halliburton's stock were to rise by $10 a share from about $53 today, the options would have been worth $6.1 million when exercised.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign was not impressed by the decision.</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said: ''Cheney got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, and now he is trying to put the cookie back. It's a last-ditch attempt to separate the Bush-Cheney ticket from big oil.''</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Cheney's tax returns not only showed a sharp increase in adjusted gross income from 1992 to 1999, they also showed total contributions to charities of $209,832, or just over 1 percent of their 10-year income of $20,677,742. Trying to put a more generous face on those figures, a statement by the Bush-Cheney campaign said $442,152 actually went to charity.</p>
        <p>That total was reached by adding $89,500 in honorariums, which Mr. Cheney had to decline and therefore redirected to charity, and $142,820 in grants from corporations on whose boards the two had served, which  matched their contributions.</p>
        <p>The Cheneys were under no legal obligation to release the income tax returns, although many candidates, including Vice President Al Gore, have done so. In April, Mr. Bush released information about his taxes, but not the actual returns.</p>
        <p>At that time, a Bush spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said, ''Traditionally the governor has made his tax return available in October.''</p>
        <p>The Cheney financial disclosure forms showed that Mr. Cheney remained a director of Procter &amp; Gamble and Union Pacific, and that Mrs. Cheney continued as a director of Lockheed Martin, the Union Pacific Resources Corporation, the Reader's Digest Association, the Exide Corporation and the AXP Mutual Fund.</p>
        <p>But the biggest items on the disclosure form were two categories of Halliburton stock options, each valued at between $1 million and $25 million, in the ranges specified by the federal form. The fact that some of Mr. Cheney's stock options could not be exercised until after inauguration was first reported by The New York Times last month.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE FINANCIAL ISSUE  Correction:  September 7, 2000, Thursday  An article on Saturday about the finances of Dick Cheney, the Republican candidate for vice president, misstated his reason for having rejected $89,500 in honorariums from 1992 to 1999 and having directed them to charity. The action was voluntary, not required.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the relationship of Mr. Cheney's wife, Lynne, to the board of Union Pacific Resources. She was a board member until the company was taken over this year by the Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, an independent oil and gas exploration company. She is not now a member.</p>
