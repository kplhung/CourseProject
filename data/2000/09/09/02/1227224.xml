      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial contends that Dick Cheney's charge that Clinton administration has run down military, leaving it with aging equipment, overextended forces and declining readiness is misleading and exaggerated; supports Pres Clinton's decision to leave it to next president to decide whether and when to construct national missile defense</p>

        <p>Dick Cheney turned up the heat on defense Wednesday with his charge that the Clinton administration had run down the military, leaving it with aging equipment, overextended forces and declining readiness. Those are stinging accusations coming from the man who ran the Pentagon during the Persian Gulf war. But on close examination, many of Mr. Cheney's points seem misleading or exaggerated. America's military forces are the world's strongest and best prepared. To stay that way they must continue adapting to the post-cold-war world, not return to the doctrines and assumptions of a decade or more ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney notes, correctly, that defense spending has fallen to just under 3 percent of national output, the lowest since Pearl Harbor. But in the current booming economy, share of output is less reliable than it used to be as a measure of military strength. Much of the percentage decline Mr. Cheney points to is accounted for by America's remarkable economic growth over the past decade, not miserliness in defense spending. Adjusted for inflation, the United States still spends about 95 percent as much for defense as it did during the cold war, though it now faces sharply reduced threats.</p>

        <p>Dick Cheney turned up the heat on defense Wednesday with his charge that the Clinton administration had run down the military, leaving it with aging equipment, overextended forces and declining readiness. Those are stinging accusations coming from the man who ran the Pentagon during the Persian Gulf war. But on close examination, many of Mr. Cheney's points seem misleading or exaggerated. America's military forces are the world's strongest and best prepared. To stay that way they must continue adapting to the post-cold-war world, not return to the doctrines and assumptions of a decade or more ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney notes, correctly, that defense spending has fallen to just under 3 percent of national output, the lowest since Pearl Harbor. But in the current booming economy, share of output is less reliable than it used to be as a measure of military strength. Much of the percentage decline Mr. Cheney points to is accounted for by America's remarkable economic growth over the past decade, not miserliness in defense spending. Adjusted for inflation, the United States still spends about 95 percent as much for defense as it did during the cold war, though it now faces sharply reduced threats.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Cheney talks about overcommitment of American forces, he is referring to United States participation in peacekeeping and peace-enforcement missions, like the NATO-led operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Although the Bush campaign now says it would begin discussions on scaling back American military forces' participation in the Balkans, the Clinton administration cannot be seriously faulted for joining its main allies in these life-saving interventions.</p>
        <p>Peacekeeping is also part of the running debate about readiness. Many of the statistical measures currently used to evaluate readiness look at factors like recent combat experience or training exercises. By those criteria, troops on duty in the Balkans separating militias or helping to rebuild infrastructure are eroding their readiness because they are neither fighting nor conducting exercises. Even so, they are acquiring skills that will be crucial for future missions. American forces need to be battle-ready, rested and properly equipped. But there is no clear agreement today on how combat readiness should be measured and no consensus that United States troops are dangerously unready for action.</p>
        <p>America's current aircraft, ships and weapons decisively outperform those of any other country, and many are scheduled for replacement with expensive successors for which there is not yet a visible need. Given this margin of safety, Mr. Cheney is right to suggest diverting a greater share of the procurement budget to research and development. Shifting procurement dollars to spare parts would do even more to improve readiness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney comes closer to the mark when he asserts that the Pentagon is straining to meet its own declared standard of being prepared for two simultaneous regional conflicts, on the scale of the Korean and Persian Gulf wars. But that standard is itself dangerously outdated, putting too much emphasis on heavy mechanized army divisions at the expense of the more mobile forces needed for responding to sudden emergencies.</p>
        <p>Defense policy ought to be part of the campaign debate, and Mr. Cheney, as a former defense secretary, is well qualified to discuss it. But he needs to do so with more precision and clarity than he managed this week.</p>
        <p>On another defense matter that has emerged as a campaign issue, President Clinton made the right call yesterday when he decided to leave it to the next president to decide whether and when to construct a national missile defense. Vice President Al Gore sees a strong case for building a limited missile defense and hopes he can persuade Russia to accept it within the framework of existing arms control treaties. Gov. George W. Bush wants to consider more robust defensive technologies and hopes to deploy an effective missile shield quickly. The president's decision to delay gives them a chance to proceed more carefully in choosing the right system and easing the concerns of Russia, China and America's skeptical NATO allies.</p>
        <p>Waiting makes sense because the missile defense technology America has been testing remains unproven and because more time is needed to find ways of constructing missile defenses without overturning the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia. Mr. Clinton also rightly deferred plans to award the initial construction contracts for radars in Alaska. Starting work on those radars could have forced Washington to give Moscow the required six months' notice of withdrawal from the ABM treaty.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's recent tests of the prototype interceptor missile have been plagued with failures, and testing the system against realistic decoys still lies ahead. Mr. Clinton serves America wisely by leaving more time for diplomacy and testing.</p>
