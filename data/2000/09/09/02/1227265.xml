        <p>In another clear signal that the economy is slowing in response to rising interest rates, the nation's private employers created only 17,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department reported yesterday, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent from 4 percent.</p>
        <p>The Verizon strike helped to hold down job growth. But the slowing was particularly noticeable in manufacturing, where 79,000 jobs disappeared and the National Association of Purchasing Management, in a separate report, said that its index of manufacturing activity had turned negative in August for the first time in 20 months.

        <p>In another clear signal that the economy is slowing in response to rising interest rates, the nation's private employers created only 17,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department reported yesterday, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent from 4 percent.</p>
        <p>The Verizon strike helped to hold down job growth. But the slowing was particularly noticeable in manufacturing, where 79,000 jobs disappeared and the National Association of Purchasing Management, in a separate report, said that its index of manufacturing activity had turned negative in August for the first time in 20 months. With consumer demand weaker, manufacturers appear to be trimming production.</p>
        <p>''The economy is clearly cooling down,'' said Gary R. Thayer, chief economist at A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, a brokerage firm based in St. Louis. Like many other Wall Street forecasters, he said that economic growth in the second half of the year would be markedly slower than in the first half, increasing at a more moderate annual rate of 3 percent to 4 percent, instead of the strong 5 percent of the first half.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve, as a result, is unlikely to raise interest rates again before next year, at the earliest, the argument on Wall Street being that the Fed's six rate increases since June 1999 have created enough drag to slow the economy to a growth rate that the Fed considers non inflationary.</p>
        <p>''The data on the economy have got to be music to the Fed's ears,'' said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities.</p>
        <p>The steady slowing in job growth is now unmistakable. While job creation in the private sector averaged 202,000 a month last year -- and 229,000 a month in the fourth quarter -- that pace has fallen to 162,000 on average this year, and only 90,000 a month since May.</p>
        <p>There were other weaknesses evident in the August numbers. Total job growth, which covers government as well as private payrolls, fell by 105,000, after a decline of 51,000 in July as the Census Bureau continued to shed workers who had been hired temporarily to count the population. From a peak of 618,000 in May, census counters shrank to 41,000 in August.</p>
        <p>All of the nation's workers also put in fewer hours in August than in any other month this summer or spring, particularly in manufacturing. The average hourly wage of production workers, who held roughly 80 percent of the nation's 131.5 million jobs in August, rose a mild 4 cents, to $13.80 an hour. Over the last 12 months, this wage has risen only 3.8 percent, despite the tight labor market. Finally, the rise in the pool of unemployed came mainly from layoffs, dismissals and new people entering the labor force, rather than people quitting their jobs confident of finding another in a strong economy. That had been the tendency last spring.</p>
        <p>''None of these statistics indicate that the tight labor market is beginning to unravel; we clearly remain at full employment or close to it,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute. ''But they signal a potential reversal in trend that deserves to be watched.''</p>
        <p>In the private sector, the August number was not quite as weak as the 17,000 new jobs suggested. If not for the strike at Verizon and a couple of other companies, private-sector job growth would have totaled 102,000. While that would have been an improvement, 102,000 is hardly robust, said Thomas Nardone, chief of the division of labor force statistics at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
        <p>''You are seeing the job slowdown clearly in construction, manufacturing and mortgage finance,'' he said, pointing to industries easily affected by short-term interest rates. Adjusted for inflation, interest rates are at one of their highest levels in this decade. In a separate report yesterday, the Commerce Department said construction spending fell in July for the fourth consecutive month.</p>
        <p>The stock market usually responds with enthusiasm to data suggesting that the economy is weakening and the Fed therefore will not raise interest rates. But the Dow Jones industrial average rose only 23.68 points yesterday, to 11,238.78, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 27.98 points, to 4,234.33.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration greeted the latest employment report with enthusiasm -- as evidence that Americans are still enjoying ''a Tiger Woods economy,'' said Alexis Herman, the secretary of labor. Still, she acknowledged that the economy was slowing. ''We have gone from spectacular to steady and stable,'' she said in a telephone interview, acknowledging that ''interest rates are having some impact.''</p>
        <p>The one bright spot in manufacturing was in electronics, a reflection of the heavy spending on computers and telecommunications, by both consumers and business. Electronics manufacturers added 4,000 jobs in August and have grown by 42,000 since April 1999, although total manufacturing employment keeps declining. Some of the recent job loss in manufacturing reflects a buildup in inventories. Companies are apparently cutting production until the stockpiles of unsold merchandise are worked down.</p>
        <p>Employment in retailing fell 34,000 in August after rising 132,000 in June and July. Still, job growth in retailing has averaged only 28,000 a month this year, down from 36,000 in 1999. Department store hiring has been particularly weak.</p>
        <p>Service industry employment, in contrast, grew by a robust 160,000 after rising only 11,000 in July. The growth came mainly in job training, management, engineering and temporary workers.</p>
        <p>The unemployment rate, rising from 4.02 percent to 4.14 percent before rounding, reflected slightly higher unemployment among almost every group, with unemployment among teenagers and blacks rising more than others.</p>
