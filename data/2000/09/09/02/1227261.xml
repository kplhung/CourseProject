        <p>In declaring that his administration would not deploy a national missile defense, President Clinton made the case today that the United States could pursue an arms control agenda but must also explore ways to meet the post- cold war missile threat.</p>
        <p>Among arms control experts, this is known as ''having your cake and eating it too,'' or more specifically, keeping the landmark 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty by amending it to allow for a limited national missile defense.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the Republican presidential nominee, George W. Bush, has said that the ABM Treaty, in which the two superpowers sought to prevent nuclear war by agreeing to remain equally vulnerable to the other's attack, is an anachronism of the cold war. His top foreign policy advisers believe the treaty should be scrapped, paving the way for a sea-or space-based missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Whatever else President Clinton did today, temporarily at least, he took the missile defense decision out of the realm of election-year deadlines and test schedules -- and returned the discussion to the fundamental question of whether the United States wants to preserve or tear up the ABM treaty, a cornerstone of superpower arms control.</p>
        <p>He said that America's security in the 21st Century depended on deterrence, diplomacy and defense. And he added that strategic stability required that all three of these concepts be preserved.</p>
        <p>''I am convinced that America and the world will be better off if we explore the frontiers of strategic defenses while continuing to pursue arms control -- to stand with our allies and to work with Russia and others to stop the spread of deadly weapons,'' Mr. Clinton said in his speech at Georgetown University.</p>
        <p>In making this argument, Mr. Clinton was acknowledging the opposition to a limited missile defense from every important corner of the globe.</p>
        <p>Starting with Washington's closest ally, Britain, the uneasiness about a national missile defense has been constant among NATO members, and was only slightly muffled after the administration made efforts this year to better explain its reasoning.</p>
        <p>Britain, which was to be the base for an upgraded radar necessary for a national missile defense, tentatively accepted the administration's calculation that North Korea presented a threat. But France and Germany never agreed with this assessment.</p>
        <p>The French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, said in an interview earlier this year that a missile defense would be disruptive to the Atlantic alliance.</p>
        <p>''There are members of the alliance who wonder if this won't lead to unequal security,'' he said. ''If there is a real threat, why are you protecting only yourselves?'' In any event, said Mr. Vedrine, North Korea was a country that harmed its own population more than anyone else.</p>
        <p>Most important, the allies were troubled by the opposition from Moscow. Consistently, the British said they would cooperate with a national missile defense only if it was done in agreement with the Russians and in the context of the ABM Treaty.</p>
        <p>In Moscow, despite nearly a year of negotiations by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who tried to convince them otherwise, the Russian leaders did not believe that the missile defense system was designed just to counter North Korea. Rather, the Russians believed the plan would start a new arms race to deploy anti-missile defenses, which their broken economy and beleaguered military forces would be unable to match.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the Chinese refused to accept that the proposed limited missile defense plan was geared against North Korea, a country they knew to be far poorer than themselves. The Chinese said they viewed missile defense as aimed at them because it would destroy China's ability to deter nuclear attack by neutralizing its relatively small force of nuclear missiles.</p>
        <p>Thus, the Chinese said, the Clinton plan would initiate an arms race and they would have no choice but to expand their own nuclear forces in response.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton appears to have listened hard to all those arguments, Mr. Bush and his defense experts, as well as some conservative Democrats, have brushed many of them aside.</p>
        <p>Because of the intensity of the subject and the stature of those who have participated in it -- including former Secretaries of State George P. Shultz and Henry A. Kissinger -- those who have promoted a more muscular national missile defense than Mr. Clinton are part of the mainstream debate.</p>
        <p>Broadly, the Bush camp argues that the ABM Treaty is an outmoded piece of security architecture that does not fit the needs of a world where a handful of countries -- North Korea, Iraq, Libya, Iran -- have or will have the capability of posing a nuclear threat against the United States.</p>
        <p>Some experts argue that the ABM Treaty should be unilaterally scrapped, if necessary. R. James Woolsey, the Clinton administration's first director of the Central Intelligence Agency, believes the treaty is illegal because it has not been resubmitted to the Senate since the break-up of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>In a widely noticed article earlier this year, Mr. Kissinger wrote: ''In the existing strategic environment the ABM Treaty constrains the nation's defense to an intolerable degree.'' He accused the Europeans of being stuck with outdated slogans, saying they should understand that a system that protected America against limited nuclear attacks would ''enhance rather than diminish our willingness to defend our allies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush picked up on this theme in a speech last May in Washington. Answering a question, he said that the ABM Treaty was an obstruction ''that makes it hard for us to fully explore the options available.''</p>
        <p>The starkest declaration for the need to do away with the ABM Treaty came from Mr. Bush's senior foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, who was a Soviet expert on his father's National Security Council.</p>
        <p>She wrote in Foreign Affairs in February that her first option would be to ''engage the Russians'' in a discussion on the advent of the new threats and the changed strategic environment. ''The United States should make clear that it prefers to move cooperatively toward a new offense-defense mix, but that it is prepared to do so unilaterally,'' Ms. Rice wrote.</p>
        <p>In another difference with the Clinton approach, Ms. Rice has said that a Bush Administration would want to make an anti-missile system available to America's European allies, ensuring that the defense of the European allies was not separated from the defense of the United States.</p>
