        <p>Federal Regulators Warn Of More Firestone Tire Ills  Shares of Firestone's parent company, Bridgestone of Japan, have declined to 1,288 yen as the tire maker struggles with a large recall. It received another blow when federal regulators warned of safety problems in Firestone tires sold as replacements for factory-issued tires on sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Firestone had rebuffed on Thursday a request from regulators to broaden its current tire recall. The agency then took the rare step of issuing a ''consumer advisory'' suggesting that people buy new tires at their own expense anyway. The agency said 1.4 million more Firestone tires were even more prone to failure than tires recently recalled on some Ford models. Bridgestone/Firestone said in a statement that it disagreed with the agency's analysis of the data. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Cheney Says He Would Sell Options  Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential candidate, said that if elected he would forfeit stock options worth $3.5 million in the energy services company that he left to run for office. Mr. Cheney had been challenged by the Gore campaign for inviting a conflict of interest if he owned the options while in office. He was precluded from selling the options, which he was awarded for his service as chief executive of the Halliburton Company, until 2001 at the earliest, and their value by then would be affected by the company's profits, which are sensitive to the price of oil.

        <p>Flaws Found in Wireless Standard  Two researchers at Lucent's Bell Laboratories have found flaws in the proposed Bluetooth wireless communications standard that would permit an eavesdropper to listen in on a digital conversation or to determine the identity of a user of the technology. Lucent is one of nine corporations developing the standard to permit communication between all kinds of portable handheld devices. [C3.]</p>
        <p>Seagram Readies Sale of Drinks Unit  Seagram opened its books this week to prospective buyers of its drinks business in what is the first stage of a sale that may run through mid-October. Already, the biggest spirits companies are jockeying for position. Most analysts expect just one outcome: Allied Domecq has been considered the front-runner since Seagram first announced plans to sell its wine and spirits business, including Absolut vodka, in June as part of its plan to merge with Vivendi. Working to Allied's advantage is its ability to bid for the business independently thanks to its financial muscle and lack of regulatory conflicts -- two issues that could handicap competitors. But Allied is facing stiff competition from Diageo of Britain, which is flush with cash, and could easily match Allied in a bidding war that threatens to inflate the price to $9 billion -- a value at which analysts said most companies would be hard pressed to make the deal pay off.

        <p>Key Manufacturing Index Weakens  The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly factory index fell last month to 49.5 from 51.8 in July. Production could slow further in months ahead: the orders index fell to 49.7 from 49.9, the second consecutive month of declining orders. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction of activity. The survey supports other data indicating that the economy's torrid growth has been dampened somewhat by six interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. [C4.]</p>
        <p>First Union Is Acquiring JWGenesis  First Union agreed to buy JWGenesis Financial, a brokerage firm with offices in 34 states, for as much as $110 million in cash to expand in the securities businesses. First Union, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., is seeking to halt two years of sliding earnings, and has exited the credit card business while beefing up securities units like brokerage, mutual funds and estate planning.
