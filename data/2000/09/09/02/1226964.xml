        <p>CHANG-David Jih-Yuan. With great sadness, we announce the passing of David Jih-Yuan Chang on September 7, 2000, in NYC after a brief illness.

A loving husband for over 30 years to Margarita; father to Rudolph; grandfather to Jonas; brother to Chi-Deu, Kenny, John, and Robert; son to K.; father-in-law to Jamie and brother-in-law to Ana. David also had a great love for the family's dogs, Badger and Dixie, and had countless friends. He will be sorely missed. For further information contact Beecher Funeral Home (914) 769-0001.</p>
