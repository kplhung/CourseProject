        <p>As a well-known member of Georgetown University's class of 1968, President Clinton has proudly shown his allegiance to the school during the last eight years, speaking on campus 12 times.</p>
        <p>As governor of Arkansas, he spoke at the university four times. He also appeared there the day before his inauguration in January 1993.</p>
        <p>So this week, when Mr. Clinton and his advisers needed a comfortable environment to make a major announcement on the future of the national missile defense program, there was one safe bet. The president decided on the site during his flight Wednesday from Cartagena, Colombia, to Washington.</p>
        <p>A White House aide said that Mr. Clinton had considered speaking before one of the many foreign policy organizations here, but was worried that news of the event might leak to the news media. The president was confident, the aide said, that Georgetown would keep the engagement quiet.</p>
        <p>The president has found Gaston Hall, a large lecture hall with stained glass windows and vaulting supports, to be a perfect auditorium: cozy, dignified and easy to fill with a friendly audience. The auditorium is in leafy Healy Circle, an area on the front side of campus where students often congregate.</p>
        <p>He has taken on serious topics at Gaston Hall, including the world AIDS crisis, Social Security reform, and youth violence. Mr. Clinton also spoke at the memorial service there for Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. from 1979 to 1995.</p>
        <p>Aides said Mr. Clinton had wanted to give a thoughtful speech that explained the reasons for his decision, which they thought would be more fitting for a university than the White House briefing room.</p>
        <p>''The president has a history of making important foreign policy announcements at Georgetown,'' said Joe Lockhart, White House spokesman, ''where there is a school of foreign service, students who are interested in national security and where the president happened to go.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lockhart also attended the university as an undergraduate.</p>
        <p>Today, before nearly 800 people, including many students and faculty, Mr. Clinton recalled his early days on campus, where he was elected president of his freshman and sophomore classes.</p>
        <p>''It was 35 years ago when, as a sophomore, I was in charge of the freshmen orientation,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''So I thought I should come and help this year's orientation of freshmen get off to a good start.''</p>
