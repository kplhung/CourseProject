        <p>After a decade of highly publicized legal wrangling, international negotiation and criminal indictments, the Quedlinburg art theft case has been quietly put to rest with the agreement by two Texans to pay a total of $135,000 in federal and state taxes, penalties and interest.</p>
        <p>The settlement was reached on April 20 in federal tax court but was not publicly announced.</p>
        <p>Legal experts and art professionals said the figure was surprisingly low since until recently the government had been seeking $8.6 million in federal taxes, $2.1 million in penalties and more than $40 million in interest from the heirs of Joe Tom Meador, a United States Army lieutenant who stole a group of priceless religious artworks while stationed in Germany in the final days of World War II. The heirs had been accused of trafficking in stolen property when they tried to sell some of the objects, but those criminal charges were thrown out several years ago, leaving only the tax case.</p>
        <p>Details of the settlement were provided by Don Lan, a tax lawyer in Dallas who represented the lieutenant's brother and sister, Jack Meador, 80, of Whitewright, Tex., and Jane Meador Cook, 66, of Mesquite, Tex., and the estate of Lieutenant Meador, who died in 1980.</p>
        <p>''It was a very favorable settlement,'' Mr. Lan said.</p>
        <p>Several experts said such settlements are not uncommon, and one offered a possible explanation for the striking reduction.</p>
        <p>''The government may well have had a strong case but recognized that there's no point in getting a major judgment if there's no realistic prospect of collecting it,'' said Stanley Johanson, a professor of law at the University of Texas at Austin and an authority on trusts and taxation. Jack Meador runs a hardware store, and his sister is the widow of a dentist.</p>
        <p>But lawyers and art experts familiar with the drawn-out proceedings expressed disappointment with the amount. ''It was a slap on the wrist,'' said Thomas R. Kline, a Washington lawyer who represented the German government in its efforts to recover the Quedlinburg treasures. ''It was a lost opportunity to encourage dealers, museum people and collectors to return stolen objects as a way of avoiding significant estate tax liabilities. The reverse message was sent.''</p>
        <p>Constance Lowenthal, director of the World Jewish Congress's Commission for Art Recovery, who followed the case closely, said she, too, was disappointed by the decision of the tax court but hoped that the case as a whole would act as a deterrent.</p>
        <p>''The Meadors have had 10 years without peace,' she said, ''and although the criminal case against them failed on technical grounds they must now realize that selling their brother's loot was the wrong way to go.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know if they repent or are regretful,'' she continued, ''but they are the poorer for it.'' Donald Roberts, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said that the disclosure provisions in tax law prohibited him from discussing the case.</p>
        <p>The Meadors also escaped the most serious criminal penalties that might have been handed to them. In January 1996, they and their former lawyer, John Torigian of Houston, were indicted on federal charges of illegally selling two of the treasures they had inherited, nearly three years after the German government had paid them $2.75 million for the entire collection. (The remaining artworks were not mentioned in the indictment.) Each defendant faced a possible 10-year sentence and a fine of up to $250,000.</p>
        <p>The indictment charged the three with conspiracy to sell 2 of the 10 treasures: the Samuhel Gospels, a gold, silver and jewel-encrusted 9th-century manuscript, and a 16th-century prayer book that is also of artistic and historical importance.</p>
        <p>Two years later, as the case was coming to trial in Sherman, Tex., a federal judge dismissed the charges on technical grounds, saying the prosecutor had collected evidence beyond the lawful time limit. When that decision was upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, the criminal prosecution came to an end. The artworks, long since returned to Germany, are part of a group of medieval treasures, many of which were kept for a millennium in the Schatzkammer, or treasure chamber, of the Quedlinburg cathedral in central Germany.</p>
        <p>They were moved to a nearby cave to shelter them when the Allies began widespread bombing of German cities in 1943. Lieutenant Meador helped himself to 10 of the best of more than 100 art objects in the cave.</p>
        <p>When returned to Germany in 1993 the treasures were exhibited triumphantly in Berlin before being returned to the Quedlinburg cathedral, which had been fitted with a modern security system.</p>
