        <p>GORDON-Lawrence. Born July 26, 1922, died September 8, 2000, of New York and Palm Beach, following a courageous battle with Alzheimer's and cancer. He was the devoted son of the late Harry and Etta Gordon and brother to Seymour. Lawrence is survived by his loving wife Janet and their children, Wendy, Scott, Peter and Petula, and from a previous marriage, daughter Kathy and grandson Eric. A decorated World War II veteran and a pioneer of industry, he was Chairman of the Board and CEO of Lehigh Valley Industries and Blue Ridge Winkler Textiles, among other Fortune 500 companies. Lawrence was a loving, charismatic, brilliant, dynamic, creative and adventurous man, and a champion golfer. Our lives have been blessed by his honor, integrity and love. He was a loving husband, father, colleague and friend, and he will be deeply missed by all who have known him. As Lord Tennyson wrote: ''Love is the only gold.'' Services will be held at Temple Emanu-El, 5th Avenue at 65th Street, Monday, September 11, 5 PM. A celebration of his life will follow the service. Contributions can be made to: Foundation of Neurologic Diseases, 10 State Street, Newburyport, MA 01950, Attn: Dr. Selkoe or to the Jacob Perlow Hospice, Beth Israel Health Care System, First Avenue at 16th St, NY, NY 10003-9973.</p>
