        <p>After riding a wave of publicity, an  animal rights group apologized yesterday to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for using his face on billboard advertising that linked milk consumption to prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>The group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, sponsored four billboards that appeared in milk-producing sections of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania last week. The ads, which were widely criticized, clearly angered the mayor, who said they were exploiting his illness.</p>
        <p>In a letter of apology to the mayor, PETA said the ads ''were not intended as an attack on you, and we're sorry they were taken that way.''</p>
        <p>The billboards, already taken down by the advertising companies that put them up, were ''intended to be provocative, not hurtful, a fine line that we regret we crossed,'' the group said.</p>
        <p>The apology elicited little response from City Hall yesterday. A spokeswoman for the mayor, Sunny Mindel, said Mr. Giuliani had not read the letter and would withhold comment.  Senior advisers to Mr. Giuliani, insisting that their names not be used, complained privately that PETA's intent was to attract more publicity.</p>
        <p>PETA, based in Norfolk, Va., has long been known for abrasive tactics in promoting animal rights. Its president, Ingrid E. Newkirk, said in an interview yesterday that the group had ''incurred a lot of wrath'' because of the ads using Mr. Giuliani's face with a milk mustache, but said that it had scored a publicity coup that exceeded its own expectations.</p>
        <p>She said 58,000 people had sought out PETA's Web site on the issue, www.dumpdairy.com, during the week since the dispute with the mayor made its way into newspapers and television reports. She added that of those who called or e-mailed their opinions, most had been sympathetic to the mayor.</p>
        <p>The squabble with PETA began on Aug. 24, when the mayor threatened to sue the group over its billboards, which were dominated by an oversized image of his face in a parody of the ubiquitous ''Got Milk?'' ads sponsored by the dairy industry. One line of text on PETA's ads read ''Got prostate cancer?'' Another read ''Drinking milk contributes to prostate cancer.''</p>
        <p>Besides threatening legal action, the mayor responded with ridicule.  He seemed to delight in the exchange, at one point spending two hours on stage at a town hall meeting last week in Midtown Manhattan with a half-gallon of milk by his side, and repeatedly drinking from a glass on his lectern.</p>
        <p>Despite PETA's apology to the mayor, Ms. Newkirk seemed yesterday to revel in the publicity, which she said had come at little cost. Because the advertising companies in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania had taken down the PETA billboards over the group's objections, she said the companies had now agreed to either refund PETA's money or erect new billboards that attack the dairy industry without using the mayor's face. PETA said it was already preparing a new campaign featuring Bill Maher, host of ''Politically Incorrect'' and a supporter.</p>
        <p>''The mayor drew more attention to this than we could have of our own devices,'' Ms. Newkirk said. ''People usually don't expect us to act like grown-ups, but they do expect it of him.''</p>
