        <p>HOGEN-Charles Robert, 92. Died on July 16 at his home in Lenox, Massachusetts. His surviving children are Timothy Hogen of New York City, Sherill Covian of Shelburne Falls, MA, Robin Hogen of Westport, CT, Lyn Mason of Seattle, Washington, and Jackson Hogen of Newbury, MA. Charles was born on October 8, 1907, to Fred Neff Hogen and Mae Ladd Hogen in Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Yale University and was on the varsity swim team that set the world record for the 250 yard relay in 1928. He graduated from Yale in 1929 and was active in alumni affairs. With his encouragement, his three sons all graduated from Yale. Upon graduation, Charles' first job was with the Holland American Line as entertainment director for Transatlantic voyages. This was how he met Carolyn Kirtland Hine of Cleveland, whom he married in 1933. In '34 he became an Account Executive for N.W. Ayer in New York City and stayed with this prestigious advertising firm for 38 years. He retired to Peru, Vermont, in 1972, where he enjoyed skiing, golf and his eight grandchildren. A memorial service will be held on September 30 in Lenox, Massachusetts. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Mountain Valley Center, (PO Box 310, Londonderry, VT 05148).</p>
