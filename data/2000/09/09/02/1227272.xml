        <p>Undaunted by a blistering sun, Gov. George W. Bush delivered a fiery denunciation of Vice President Al Gore's credibility today, telling more than 2,000 sweaty but boisterous supporters that the Clinton administration had repeatedly failed to fulfill its campaign pledges of the past.</p>
        <p>Focusing on a theme likely to be a central part of his fall strategy, Mr. Bush mocked his Democratic opponent for making pledges this year that sounded like ones he made in 1992: to cut taxes on the middle class and create a prescription drug benefit for the elderly.</p>

        <p>Undaunted by a blistering sun, Gov. George W. Bush delivered a fiery denunciation of Vice President Al Gore's credibility today, telling more than 2,000 sweaty but boisterous supporters that the Clinton administration had repeatedly failed to fulfill its campaign pledges of the past.</p>
        <p>Focusing on a theme likely to be a central part of his fall strategy, Mr. Bush mocked his Democratic opponent for making pledges this year that sounded like ones he made in 1992: to cut taxes on the middle class and create a prescription drug benefit for the elderly.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of like an echo from the past,'' Mr. Bush said. ''They're having to campaign on it again. But our message is: You had your chance, you have not led, and we will.''</p>
        <p>On a day when the Republicans began broadcasting a tough new commercial attacking Vice President Al Gore's character, Mr. Bush continued to vow that he would elevate political discourse in Washington if elected.</p>
        <p>''America's better days are ahead when we have leadership that will work to change the tone in our nation's capital,'' he said from a podium on the airport tarmac here.</p>
        <p>Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for the Gore campaign, said of Mr. Bush's remarks, ''It's hypocritical of Mr. Bush to talk about a change of tone in Washington while launching a negative personal attack.''</p>
        <p>The two weeks since the end of the Democratic convention have not been particularly good for Mr. Bush, who has seen his lead in most national polls evaporate.</p>
        <p>Yet in a morning news conference aboard his campaign plane, Mr. Bush expressed few concerns and said he felt that the campaign was ''in excellent shape.''</p>
        <p>''Not only do I feel we're in good shape, by looking at the polls, I feel our team is unified and enthused, and I'm very pleased with where we are in the campaign,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides often cite the size of his crowds as evidence of his momentum. He has drawn thousands of energetic supporters in the last few days. And while Mr. Bush seemed subdued early in the week, on Thursday and again today he looked loose, confident and animated.</p>
        <p>Accusing Mr. Gore of being unable to work with Republicans, Mr. Bush praised a Democratic senator from Louisiana, John B. Breaux, who has co-written a bipartisan plan for revamping Medicare that Mr. Bush broadly supports. Mr. Gore opposes the plan, which calls for introducing more private competition into the Medicare system.</p>
        <p>''It's time to bring Republicans and Democrats together to make sure the promise of Medicare is kept to our seniors,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Many people in the audience here were pleased with the Republicans' tougher tone this week, saying they were worried that Mr. Bush was slipping a bit.</p>
        <p>''I told him he has to go on the offensive,'' said Elaine Curry, 55, a secretary to an oil company who met Mr. Bush today. ''Dang, it's a campaign, and you have to fight.''</p>
