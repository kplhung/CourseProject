        <p>The Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica S.A. reported net profit for the first half of the year at 989 million euros ($881 million), a 3 percent drop from the period in 1999. The company said  positive results from its domestic cell phone operations and its international activities helped compensate for weakness in other areas, like traditional services. Earnings from Latin American operations were almost 125 million euros, up 31 percent, reflecting that region's improving economy. On the Madrid bolsa, Telefonica's share prices posted gains of as much as 8.7 percent at the news. Giving in to pressure from the board, Juan Villalonga, the chairman, resigned just over a month ago, ending months of uncertainty over the company's direction.</p>
