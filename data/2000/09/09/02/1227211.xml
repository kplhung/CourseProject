        <p>Public sculpture is a deeply contentious area, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani may have recently discovered when he created a ruckus by proposing to install a statue of Frank Sinatra in Times Square. Often the battle lines are drawn between those who favor abstract pieces and those who support more traditional, realistic works. In the summer 1999 issue of City Journal, Francis Morrone, the author of The Architectural Guidebook to New York City, looked at the debate over public monuments and made his own suggestions for commemorative statues for New York City. Excerpts from his article, ''Statues and Civic Memory,'' follow.</p>
        <p>Almost from the time that cities first arose, their inhabitants have filled them with statues and monuments, as if such adornments were an essential ingredient of civilized urban life.</p>
        <p>For the ancients, statues were the repository of civic memory, commemorating the great and good deeds that built the society. For every new generation, they spurred the ambitious to emulate such deeds, and they defined the virtues that the community thought  worthy of honor.</p>
        <p>For millennia, the Western world -- New York included -- has carried on the tradition of monument-making in this spirit. But in the years since World War II, the knack seems to have disappeared. The modernist aesthetic doesn't think much of decoration or of figurative sculpture. More important, today it is unfashionable, almost politically incorrect, to honor people so grandly. In our age of equality, we don't like the idea of heroes: we dwell more on the imperfections of our great men than on their uniqueness, and we believe that vast impersonal forces, rather than extraordinary individuals, are the makers of history.</p>
        <p>Has the great tradition of figurative, symbolic civic sculpture truly petered out? With few exceptions, such as the Javits Center's recently dedicated statue of its eponymous senator, our public sculpture since World War II has mostly been abstract. One thinks of the sundry works by Calder, Noguchi and countless lesser lights adorning sundry antiseptic plazas in front of glass office buildings. Philip Johnson's kitschy bronze clock, just installed across from Lincoln Center and looking like a refugee from Disney's ''Beauty and the Beast,'' at least tells the time, whereas Noguchi's famous orange cube in front of 140 Broadway, like most of its abstract brethren, signifies nothing; it has nothing to say about civic memory or civic ideals. Even worse, minimalist sculptor Richard Serra's ''Tilted Arc,'' a Cor-Ten steel wall that bisected Manhattan's Federal Plaza in the 1980's, expressed little but indifference, perhaps even hostility, to the concerns and aspirations of mankind. Workers in the Federal Building hated this steel wall, regarding it as a brutal and inconvenient intrusion in their daily lives. The General Services Administration eventually consented to their petition asking that the thing be removed -- to the horror of today's art world panjandrums, who decried the philistinism of the masses.</p>
        <p>Maybe for ordinary New Yorkers, like those who so often leave flowers at our war memorials, the great tradition never died. Perhaps, now that so many civic traditions once thought lifeless are again vigorously alive -- witness the magnificent restorations of Grand Central Terminal and the Public Library reading room or the breathtaking new ancient Greek galleries at the Metropolitan Museum -- we might try revivifying this one, too.</p>
        <p>Not a single monument or memorial -- not even a plaque or a street sign -- exists anywhere in New York to the three native New Yorkers who just happen to be America's three greatest novelists: Henry James, Herman Melville and Edith Wharton, the last of whom is as important a chronicler and definer of her city as Dickens is of his.</p>
        <p>New York has in general done a remarkably poor job of honoring its writers: a bronze bust, from the 1880's, of Washington Irving stands at the corner of Irving Place and 17th Street, in front of Washington Irving High School; a bronze statue, from the 1870's, of the obscure poet Fitz-Greene Halleck stands on Literary Walk in Central Park; a grand memorial to poet and civic leader William Cullen Bryant adjoins the Public Library in the park named in his honor; insubstantial lettering on a couple of street signs commemorates onetime city residents Edgar Allen Poe and Isaac Bashevis Singer. And, amazingly, that's about it.</p>
        <p>In so rich and philanthropic a city as this, can we not erect statues to honor the three greatest writers New York gave the world? Why can we not put them up in the mall in Central Park, to fill some of the gaping holes in never-completed Literary Walk -- a notion Parks Commissioner Henry Stern says he would welcome? Perhaps this modest step -- it would cost less than $1 million -- might spark a renaissance in the art of civic sculpture in New York. At the very least, as Henry G. Stebbins said of Central Park's statue of Shakespeare, it ''will remind coming generations that we were able to appreciate the genius and know how to fitly honor'' the memory of the world-renowned writers our own city nurtured.</p>
        <p>THINK TANK  Correction:  September 15, 2000, Friday  An article in Arts &amp; Ideas on Sept. 2 about public sculpture in New York City included a name erroneously among native New York writers to whom New York has no memorials. There is indeed a memorial to Herman Melville: a bronze bust with a plaque is set into the wall of 17 State Street at an outdoor sitting area and looks over the site of his birthplace at 6 Pearl Street.</p>
