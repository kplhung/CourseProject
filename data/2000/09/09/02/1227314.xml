        <p>Despite talk of a huge rally of prayer and protest, it was cheers for the boys in cleats that took center stage tonight under the Friday-night lights at the high school football field here.</p>
        <p>Many fans quietly recited The Lord's Prayer before the start of the game, an action designed partly to protest the Supreme Court ruling in June that forbade a pregame prayer routine led by students. But most of the noise came from clapping hands and shouts for the young football players.</p>
        <p>''The crowd is much, much, much smaller than we had feared it would be,'' said Gary Causey, the principal at Santa Fe High School, who noted that the school had more than two dozen fire trucks and ambulances on hand, in preparation for an overwhelming crowd of praying protesters.</p>
        <p>''In fact,'' Mr. Causey added, ''it's a much smaller crowd than we'd expect for an opening-night game. I think a lot of the locals stayed home because they didn't want to deal with a mess.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, perhaps a few hundred out-of-towners attended the game to make a point, many of them wearing shirts with religious inscriptions. Outside the football field fence, a group of about two dozen people sang hymns, while two men shouldered wooden crosses.</p>
        <p>It was clear that an overwhelming majority of people here supported the right to pray at the game, even if they did not join in themselves.</p>
        <p>''It's a defense of Christianity, basically,'' said John Patteson, a 65-year-old retired construction worker.</p>
        <p>Tom Taggart, a 40-year-old truck driver, said, ''It's not about praying anymore. It's about our rights and freedoms being taken away.''</p>
        <p>A group called No Pray, No Play had sent e-mail messages around Texas, encouraging people to come to Santa Fe and pray. And many people here, from Santa Fe and beyond, wore shirts inscribed with Bible verses. The high school booster club had shirts printed up with the wording ''Gotta Believe.''</p>
        <p>Hardly anyone in attendance said they were offended by the overtly religious signs and praying at a football game.</p>
        <p>But Candy Gerulis, a 43-year-old hair stylist from Santa Fe, was one who said the scene bothered her.</p>
        <p>''This is crazy,'' said Ms. Gerulis, who was raised Catholic. ''It makes me feel uncomfortable to have people stand up and start praying around me at a football game.''</p>
        <p>The game tonight -- between the Santa Fe Indians and the Hitchcock Bulldogs, which Santa Fe won 21-14 -- was the first in town after the Supreme Court ruling that prohibited the pregame prayers led by students in a ritual that amounted to an official ceremony.</p>
        <p>The 6-to-3 majority opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens said that even when attendance at a game was voluntary and even when the decision to pray was made by students instead of school-district officials, ''the delivery of a pregame prayer has the improper effect of coercing those present to participate in an act of religious worship'' and violated the Constitution's ban on state promotion of religion.</p>
        <p>Legal scholars generally agreed that the latest tack -- prayers led by people in grandstands, with no formal ties to the school -- probably falls within the framework of protected speech.</p>
        <p>While prayer at football games enjoys overwhelming support in Santa Fe, some local people have expressed misgivings about the pregame prayers being used by groups from out of town interested in making political hay.</p>
        <p>A local pastor who was a supporter of the prayers, the Rev. Eugene Easterly, said that the prayers were meant to be ''a simple expression of faith,'' not a forum for disgruntled religious leaders from around the country.</p>
        <p>Prayers have been featured at football games and venues in several Southern towns and cities recently.</p>
        <p>In Asheville, N.C., more than 25,000 people gathered last month at a high school football stadium in an event sponsored by a group called ''We Still Pray.''</p>
        <p>In most cases, prayer organizers have tried to abide by the court ruling by bypassing school administrators. But some districts have fairly flouted the court ruling. In Batesburg-Leesville, S.C., the student body president recently recited a prayer over the public address system before a football game. The school board in Searcy, Ark., voted to allow a Christian group to hold prayers around a flagpole before games.</p>
        <p>Around Santa Fe, the football prayer issue has become a matter of intense civic pride. At the entrance to town on Farm Road 646, a sign reads ''We Still Pray in Santa Fe.''</p>
        <p>The Busy Bee Cafe has a sign that reads, ''Good Luck Indians and God Bless America.'' And the Cowboy barbecue restaurant has a sign of support to the football team and fans, ''Our Prayers Are With You.''</p>
