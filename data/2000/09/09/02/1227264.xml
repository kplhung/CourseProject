        <p>The Seagram Company opened its books this week to prospective buyers of its drinks business in what is the first stage of a sale that may run through mid-October. Already, the biggest spirits companies are jockeying for position.</p>
        <p>The number of possible bidders has grown from two to six. Alliances have been formed, broken and reformed. Absolut vodka, the centerpiece of the Seagram empire, remains a wild card. And complex tax issues threaten the very idea of a breakup.</p>
        <p>''There are lots of people with lots of interests to defend,'' one executive close to the discussions said.</p>
        <p>Yet, even as the field may be confusing, most analysts expect just one  outcome. Allied Domecq P.L.C. was  considered the front-runner when Seagram first announced plans to sell its wine and spirits business in June as part of its plan to merge with Vivendi S.A., the French media and utility conglomerate. And the same holds true today.</p>
        <p>Working to Allied's advantage is its ability to bid for the business independently thanks to its financial muscle and lack of regulatory conflicts -- two issues that could handicap competitors.</p>
        <p>First, analysts say that Allied is the most likely partner for Vin and Sprit, the Swedish owner of Absolut vodka, which has hinted that it will use the change of ownership to secure a better deal, possibly with a new partner. Vin and Sprit's existing contract with Seagram is confidential, but analysts estimate that Absolut accounts for 10 percent of the beverage operation's total liquor sales, or $75 million to $100 million a year.</p>
        <p>But Allied's success -- which depends in part on its ability to raise debt or equity so that it may swallow a company with a market value nearly twice its own -- is far from assured. It is facing stiff competition from Diageo P.L.C. of Britain, which is flush with cash, and could easily match Allied in a bidding war that threatens to inflate the price to $9 billion -- a value at which analysts said most companies would be hard pressed to make the deal pay off.</p>
        <p>What is clear is that locking up support from Vin and Sprit will be crucial in the battle for one of the last gems in a rapidly consolidating industry.</p>
        <p>With brands ranging from Chivas Regal premium Scotch to Captain Morgan's rum, Seagram's wine and spirits business ranks third worldwide, behind Diageo, home of Johnnie Walker Scotch and Smirnoff vodka, and Allied Domecq, which owns Ballantine's Scotch and Kahlua liqueur.</p>
        <p>''Vin and Sprit doesn't want to be in this position again, where someone  decides to sell a business and carve it up,'' the executive close to the discussions said. ''They would like to get more control, either through  ownership, or some iron-clad rights agreement.''</p>
        <p>One way for Vin and Sprit to shore up its prospects is to take a stake in one of the bidders. Absolut declined to comment on the contract or the bidding process, as did Allied and Diageo.</p>
        <p>Diageo, which was formed through the merger of GrandMet and Guinness in 1997, could have less bargaining power than Allied. GrandMet used to own the global distribution rights to Absolut, but it lost them to Seagram in 1994, because Vin and Sprit did not want Absolut sold in tandem with the other GrandMet vodka label, Smirnoff.</p>
        <p>''Allied will retain the support of Absolut,'' said Graeme Eadie, an analyst with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eadie said he expected Allied to win the auction for three reasons: An alliance with Vin and Sprit, cost savings that will allow it to make the deal, and the flexibility that comes with bidding independently.</p>
        <p>Allied will be able to offer the highest price for Seagram's drinks business, he said, because it will also see the greatest cost savings. He expects Allied to save $:220 million a year, or $319 million, by pushing Seagram brands through its existing distribution system -- nearly double the savings seen for Diageo.</p>
        <p>As one of the few companies able to make an independent bid for Seagram, Allied has more freedom than does Diageo, which has chosen to make a bid jointly with Pernod Ricard of France. The two companies are expected to split the Seagram brands between them and in this way Diageo hopes to avoid antitrust issues.</p>
        <p>Consortiums have a greater chance of failure, Mr. Eadie noted, especially during the last phase of bidding, because it is often difficult to get the parties to agree on the fair value of a company.</p>
        <p>Allied, which is one of the few companies that could swallow Seagram whole, may have another advantage in the form of a giant tax bill that could be imposed on any company trying to split up the business -- an issue that flies against Diageo's strategy.</p>
        <p>''The tax implications are tremendously complicated,'' the executive close to the discussions said. The Seagram business was built ''without any thought of it ever being pulled apart.''</p>
        <p>As for the other players, the rum maker Bacardi lacks the financial muscle to bid independently, and after its initial talks with Diageo broke down over how to carve up Seagram, Bacardi has yet to find another partner. Remy Cointreau's strategy of buying ''tail brands'' on the cheap makes it an unlikely contender.</p>
        <p>Then there is the Bronfman family, who own 24 percent of Seagram, and is said to be keen on keeping the business that Samuel Bronfman bought in 1924. Even if the Bronfmans formed a consortium to finance the deal, analysts said, Allied and Diageo could easily outbid that group.</p>
        <p>The first bids are due by the end of the month.</p>
