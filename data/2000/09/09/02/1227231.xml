        <p>When Daniel Burgess saw the statue of Arthur Ashe, he was stunned and disappointed. It did not look like Ashe. It did not have a clear connection to tennis. And the man was naked.</p>
        <p>So Burgess, of Freeport, N.Y., decided to do something about it. Yesterday he handed out copies of a letter he drafted to the United States Tennis Association, requesting the ''immediate removal'' of the statue, which is on the grounds of the National Tennis Center.</p>
        <p>Burgess said he had already received more than 1,000 signatures from people across the country in a campaign that was being coordinated nationally through e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>In his letter titled ''Citizens to Uphold the Profound Legacy of Arthur Ashe,'' Burgess declared the sculpture a failure ''to depict the true essence of Mr. Ashe's life.''</p>
        <p>In response, the USTA issued a statement, saying, ''The USTA National Tennis Center is one of the premier tennis facilities in the world and believes that the latest addition to our grounds, the sculpture and commemorative garden in honor of Arthur Ashe, respects and honors the legacy of this great man.</p>
        <p>''The sculpture is not a depiction of Arthur, it is a representation honoring his legacy and memory. We believe the sculpture embodies the qualities of Ashe, dignity, powerful determination and uncommon grace.''</p>
        <p>Burgess praised the statue for its ''strength, power, boldness'' and beauty, but suggested that a museum would be a more appropriate venue.</p>
        <p>''Are you going to take a picture of your kid up there?'' he asked rhetorically. ''No, of course not. It's just not what we would like.''</p>
        <p>Larry Burgess agreed fully with his uncle's assessment.</p>
        <p>''It's not commemorative,'' Larry Burgess said. ''It doesn't reflect what he stood for. I think that he was a man who carried himself with pride. He was an athlete, but he also tried to help people less fortunate than himself. I think when you look at the statue, it's just a big naked statue. It's just sitting there. It doesn't have anything to do with Arthur Ashe.''</p>
        <p>More Than a Hobby</p>
        <p>When Wayne Arthurs was growing up in Australia, he squeezed tennis  practices around his studies. A few times a week he would wander to the  courts and hit with his father, Derek, a Davis Cup player for Ireland from 1962 to 1966. But it was an infrequent, if cherished, hobby and one he knew could never become anything more.</p>
        <p>''Maybe that's why I'm here now,'' the 29-year-old Arthurs said, after smashing his way past his fellow Australian Jason Stoltenberg, 2-6, 7-6 (2), 6-4, 6-4, to advance to the third round. ''I never thought I could be a tennis player, but I always wanted to. I always loved the game. School was ahead. I had the tennis background, but I never really in my mind thought I could play tennis at this level until I was playing tennis on this level.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night Arthurs, who qualified for the United States Open, upset second-seeded Gustavo Kuerten, slamming 26 aces that registered up to 134 miles an hour on the radar gun.</p>
        <p>The highest remaining seeded player between Arthurs and the semifinals is eighth-seeded Alex Corretja.</p>
        <p>Russian Finds His Niche</p>
        <p>Ten years ago Max Mirnyi arrived at Kennedy Airport and stared disbelievingly at a limousine. The player, then 13, had traveled to the United States from what is now Belarus for an opportunity to play tennis. He wondered why the car did not split in half. He had never seen such a thing.</p>
        <p>But after living 10 months in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, Mirnyi quickly adjusted to the wealth of America, a different language and new people. And he also discovered a Russian community in Brighton Beach.</p>
        <p>For the first time he had access to quality equipment, smooth courts and a supply of tennis balls in a country where competitive tennis could become a top priority.</p>
        <p>And it paid off. Yesterday the 58th-ranked Mirnyi advanced to the third round of the United States Open, after upsetting Albert Costa, 6-4, 6-1, 6-4. Mirnyi's blistering serve appeared to unnerve the 23rd-ranked Spaniard, who lost the second set at love on three straight aces that averaged 124 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>On Thursday Mirnyi and Anna Kournikova, friends since his second year in the United States, marched past Alicia Molik and Sandon Stolle, 7-6 (6), 6-2, in mixed doubles.</p>
        <p>Mirnyi, who became an American  resident this year, has already gone back to visit Brighton Beach, a pilgrimage he makes every time he comes back to New York.</p>
        <p>''It's bringing me this special feeling from almost 10 years ago from the first time I came over,'' he said. ''If I hadn't gone to New York, I wouldn't be where I am right now.''</p>
