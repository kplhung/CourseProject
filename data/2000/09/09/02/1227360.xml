        <p>BRIGGS-Taylor Rastrick. LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae, L.L.P., mourns with sorrow the September 1 passing of our dear friend, colleague, and former Chairman, Taylor Rastrick Briggs. An immensely gifted litigator, Taylor joined LeBoeuf in 1961, was made Partner in 1963 and served as Chairman for 10 years, from 1978 to 1988. He became Counsel to the Firm in 1995. A leader and mentor who exemplified integrity and grace, Taylor will be missed by all who knew him. We extend condolences to his wife, Jane, their four children, Cynthia, Jennifer, Pamela and Taylor, Jr., and nine grandchildren. A memorial service has been scheduled for 2 PM on Wednesday, September 6, 2000, at St. John's Episcopal Church in Williamstown, MA.</p>
        <p>BRIGGS-Taylor. The musicians, trustees, and staff of the Marlboro School of Music express their deepest sympathy to the family of Taylor R. Briggs. Mr. Briggs was a member of the Marlboro Board of Trustees since 1992 and played a vital leadership role, including his service as Marlboro's pro bono general counsel. He was a wonderful friend and host to young musicians and to all the Marlboro family. His wisdom, kindness, humanity, and gentility will be dearly missed by us all, and never forgotten.</p>
