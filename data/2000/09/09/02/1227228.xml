        <p>If last summer was like a sauna, this summer has been like a plunge into a chilly lake. This summer has made the Top 20 list of cool summers in New York; last summer, by contrast, was the hottest since 1876, when regular weather record-keeping began.</p>
        <p>This June, July and August, the meteorological summer as defined by the National Weather Service, have been the 19th chilliest in 124 years. June, with a high of 92 and an average temperature of 71.3, was only slightly cooler than usual. But in July and August, temperatures fell and did not rise above 89. It was the first July-August combination on record when the temperature never reached 90 degrees.</p>
        <p>The last July that was this cool was in 1914, when America was debating the merits of entering World War I. The average temperature this August was 72.7, three degrees below a 124-year average, making it one of the 30 chilliest Augusts on record.</p>
        <p>The average summer-months temperature in Central Park is 76 degrees.  The average over the last three months was 71.</p>
        <p>It was a wet summer, too, though perhaps not as wet as it seemed. Sixteen inches of rain accumulated in June, July and August, but that was only 4 inches more than the three-month average in New York.</p>
        <p>For many survivors of last summer's blistering heat, the extended cool days were a gift. But the long-lasting chill, the rain and the frequent mugginess were penetrating, affecting the moods, finances, eating habits and travels of New Yorkers and tourists.</p>
        <p>At Babbo, an upscale Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village, the carpaccio and cold grilled salmon remained in the refrigerator. Instead, customers asked for rich, meaty dishes like ribeye steak and oxtail gnocchi. In the past, those were considered winter meals and were taken off the menu until mid-fall, said Mario Batali, the chef.</p>
        <p>The glasses held wintry wines as well.</p>
        <p>''Always -- sauvignon blancs for the summer,'' said Mr. Batali. ''But when I checked the wine sales, I was blown away. Red is outselling white 3 or 4 to 1.''</p>
        <p>Red wines have been unusually popular at K and D Wines and Spirits on the Upper East Side, too. ''We've sold more red wine -- markedly,'' said Neil Weinstock, the manager. ''In the hot summer, I sell much more white. This year, it's even.''</p>
        <p>Other effects of the extended chill have run from the obvious to the unexpected. Unsurprisingly, electricity use (if not the bills) and seasonal-businesses profits are far below average. For purveyors of ice cream, beach paraphernalia, and seaside parking lots, it has been a lean three months.</p>
        <p>Far fewer people drove to the beach for the day or the weekend. The day trippers who buy meals and drinks at the Cull House while waiting for the Fire Island ferry in Sayville, on Long Island, have almost disappeared, said Fanny Whitfield, who has been a waitress there for 16 years. But the Fire Island regulars and the locals have kept coming.</p>
        <p>People who spend a week or two at a seaside resort every year went ahead with their vacations. Having paid their deposits, they made the best of their time, said Andrew Cripps, executive director of the Greater Wildwood Chamber of Commerce in Wildwood, N.J. ''Restaurants had the best year in memory,'' he said. ''But people who opened a brand-new water park -- I kind of feel for them.''</p>
        <p>At Cape May, N.J., where rooms are usually reserved a year in advance, vacationers turned to the little museums and guided tours of the historical courthouse -- places they ignored when the weather was hot and they were aching for the beach. At the Cape May zoo, attendance and contributions broke all-time records. The miniature golf courses were popular. So were the Ocean City Museum and Cold Spring Village, a replication of an 18th-century town. Visitors camping in recreational vehicles and vans lighted fires at night and gathered around to talk and sing.</p>
        <p>At Camp Killooleet in Vermont -- and, no doubt, at summer camps throughout the Northeast -- the children made more ceramic and stained-glass pieces and played more ''silly games,'' said Kate Seeger, the director. Swimming and tennis were out, but the campers still took hikes. ''It took days for their sneakers to dry,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Their parents were probably spending extra time mowing the lawn and trimming the hedges. Extra rain makes grass and bushes grow rapidly. Nevertheless, brown spots may appear on the lawns, just like the patches from last summer's drought. Too much rain fosters fungal diseases, while too little scorches the blades, said Eileen Boyle, director of horticulture at the New York Botanical Garden. ''They turn brown and curl up either way,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''It's been a one-two punch'' for most plants, from grasses and flowers to vegetables and fruit trees, she continued. ''Not only is this the coldest summer, last year was the hottest. The damage from the drought to the root system is compounded by the wetness.''</p>
        <p>The result is roses with black spots and powdery mildrew; fungal diseases and brown spots on peaches, and early lost leaves on sycamore and London plane trees in low-lying areas.</p>
        <p>But trees on high ground are doing quite well, and this should be a brilliant year for fall foliage. ''The bright color has to do with the amount of sugar in the leaves,'' she said. ''The more rain, the greener and happier the trees.''</p>
        <p>Ferns and weeds are flourishing. So are lettuce, beans, peas and cabbages, she said. Vine fruits like melons and pumpkins are liable to rot before they ripen, but tomatoes and peppers, which remained green through August, should ripen.</p>
        <p>The Northeast was not the only spot in the country experiencing a strange summer. The chill in New York and the heat in the West are related, said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University. ''Obviously, the world is all connected meteorologically,'' he said. ''The same weather that brought blistering heat to Texas and the Plains brought cool weather to New York.''</p>
        <p>The cause of the unusual weather, he said, is a vast high-pressure area centered over North Texas all summer. ''Usually,'' said Mr. Gadomski, ''these things move.'' Around the center, winds stretching from Texas to western Canada to the Atlantic Coast are spinning clockwise.</p>
        <p>With few clouds in the Texas skies to shield the relentless sun, the clockwise winds have pulled the extreme heat north into Montana and Idaho. Meanwhile, Mr. Gadomski said, thunderstorms boiled up in the mountains and the Western forests burst into flame when lightning struck the dry trees.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the winds cool as they circle through Western Canada to the Atlantic Coast. By the time they spin over the ocean, the once-stifling hot air has cooled considerably; when it reaches the New York metropolitan area, it has a definite chill.</p>
        <p>Despite the damp, Mr. Gadomski said: ''This is by no means a Top 10 wet kind of summer. It's just somewhat damp and notable for how frequently the winds blew in from the ocean, making it cloudy and dull.''</p>
        <p>The cool weather should persist through mid-September and intensify next week, said Mr. Gadomski. ''We're expecting a shot of cold air from eastern Canada,'' he said. ''It should be pleasant -- cool but not cloudy.''</p>
        <p>By then, the pools and public beaches, which had the lowest attendance in decades, will be closed. Day trips to the beach will have to wait until next year. Ms. Whitfield, waiting tables in Sayville, has barely missed the day trippers. ''There were hardly any this year,'' she said,  ''but then, they're the worst tippers of the bunch.''</p>
