        <p>A French team investigating the crash of an Air France Concorde in July issued a preliminary report Thursday night that included a chilling transcript of the exchange between the control tower and the cockpit but no conclusions about the accident, which killed 109 people in the plane and 4 on the ground.</p>
        <p>''Concorde 4590, you have flames, you have flames behind you,'' the control tower at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris warned the elegant needle-nosed aircraft just after it had soared off the runway.</p>
        <p>Seconds later, the Concorde's navigator said Engine No. 2 was malfunctioning and the pilot, apparently believing the engine was on fire, ordered it turned off. Then the co-pilot warned, ''Watch out, the indicator, the indicator, the indicator!'' meaning that the speed was dropping.</p>
        <p>''It's really burning,'' the air controller replied, ''and I'm not sure it's coming from the engine.''</p>
        <p>At that point Engine No. 1, just next to Engine No. 2, was losing power. That may have left the plane with too little thrust to fly. Investigators later found no marks of fire inside either engine; only the wing and fuselage were scorched.</p>
        <p>The first realization that Air France Flight 4590 was in trouble was in those exchanges, released late Thursday on the Web site of the French Bureau of Accident Investigations and discussed today at a news conference as investigators presented their preliminary report.</p>
        <p>They defended their theory that a tire popped by a scrap of runway debris had ruptured wing fuel tanks, starting a fire.</p>
        <p>It was also disclosed today that one of three daily runway inspections was skipped that day because of a fire drill. The runway thus had not been thoroughly inspected for about 12 hours before the supersonic jet took off, officials said.</p>
        <p>The crew did not remark aloud about Engine No. 1's problems. According to a data recorder analyzed later, its power waned, surged and waned again, for unknown reasons. After the pilot ordered No. 2 cut off, he was distracted by the landing gear's failure to retract. Meanwhile, the co-pilot kept drawing attention to the airspeed indicator.</p>
        <p>While those decisions were being made in the 77 seconds between 4:43:13 P.M. on July 25, when the controller spotted the fire, and 4:44:30, when the last sound was recorded, amateur photographers on the highways below were capturing the flight as it spewed flames and smoke, roaring low and slow over the suburbs and farms north of Paris.</p>
        <p>But then it banked sharply left and dived into a small hotel in the suburb of Gonesse. Four people there were killed.</p>
        <p>The final report will not be issued until the plane is rebuilt in a naval air base hangar, which could take a year. But investigators still believe that just as the Concorde had reached 195 miles an hour -- too fast to abort takeoff -- a stray piece of bent metal stabbed deep into one of its tires. The tire, hot from friction, exploded, sending chunks of rubber as heavy as eight pounds flying upward with such force that they punctured the huge triangular left wing.</p>
        <p>As the plane slowed, controllers were recorded scrambling the airport's fire brigade, clearing Runway 26 and telling the crew: ''4590, you have fierce flames behind you. At your convenience, you have priority to return to the runway.'' But it could not. With alarms gonging in the cockpit and a warning system crying, ''Whoop, whooop, pull up!'' the pilot, Christian Marty, was heard to say: ''Too late. No time, no.''</p>
        <p>The last recorded words were from the co-pilot, Jean Marcot: ''Negative. We're trying Le Bourget . . . no.''</p>
        <p>For about nine seconds, there were ''unclear sounds like exertion,'' and then the recording ended. It was the first fatal crash in the 26 years that Concordes have flown commercially.</p>
        <p>Investigators warned that any of France's five remaining Concordes, now grounded, could suffer the same burst-tire accident.</p>
        <p>''We cannot be certain that, if another Concorde were to make the same flight today, the same thing would not happen,'' Paul-Louis Arslanian, director of the air investigation bureau, said today.</p>
        <p>There have been six previous cases of damage to Concorde fuel tanks. In a 1979 incident at Dulles International Airport near Washington, rubber debris and wheel shrapnel tore through a wing, but the plane landed safely.</p>
        <p>British aviation officials said last month that their Concordes were modified in 1993 with landing gear deflectors to protect the wings in a tire blowout. French ones, they said, do not have this feature.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, a picture of the 17-inch strip of metal found on the runway that investigators believe slashed the tire was posted on the agency's Web site. It is long and thin and bent in a 7-shape, and it has pairs of holes, some of which contained ''cherry'' rivets, according to the report. The make of plane it came from has not been identified.</p>
        <p>A picture of reassembled pieces of the blown tire was also released; a 12-inch slice is clearly visible.</p>
