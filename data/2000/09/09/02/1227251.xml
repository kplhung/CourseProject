        <p>For four days this week, the United Nations and then the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel played host to an unusual assembly of religious figures from around the globe, who came together for an event called the Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders.</p>
        <p>As a body, these men and women -- 800 of them in all, according to the event's organizers, with around 1,000 other participants -- made a colorful sight, especially when seated in the United Nation's General Assembly hall in their robes, turbans and clerical collars.</p>
        <p>Despite the presence of some underlying tensions among some of the groups, the conference seemed to focus on its declared objective, getting the leaders to talk about world peace. And by Thursday, the closing day, many participants had signed a declaration pledging themselves to work for just that -- along with combatting poverty and pressing for environmental protection.</p>
        <p>But what was really accomplished by the conference -- sponsored by foundations and so not officially a United Nations' event -- remains to be seen, though several participants identified its primary value as simply allowing people of diverse religious backgrounds to meet and talk with each other.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the greatest challenge the organizers initially faced was dealing with strong criticism about the absence of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet, whose presence at the United Nations had been blocked by China. But the Dalai Lama's voice was not entirely absent from the proceedings.</p>
        <p>He wrote a message, delivered to participants, in which he declared that leaders of different faiths ''can play a pivotal role'' in creating peace by explaining to their followers the need to respect the beliefs of others.</p>
        <p>''We need to embrace the spirit of pluralism in the field of religions as well,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>But he also said there would be no peace ''as long as there is grinding poverty, social injustice, inequality, oppression, environmental degradation, and as long as the weak and small continue to be trodden by the mighty and powerful.''</p>
        <p>These are issues that religious leaders need to work together to eliminate, the Dalai Lama said, and ''are the enemies of peace and true tyrannies of our times.''</p>
        <p>His broad plea, for religious leaders to engage in interfaith understanding and cooperation, was echoed by many others. Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the chief rabbi of Britain, said that mass migrations and new communications technologies had brought people into close proximity who had previously been strangers to one another. And therein lay a theological challenge to believers.</p>
        <p>''God has brought us eyeball to eyeball with the diversity of His world,'' Rabbi Sacks said. ''And right now he is asking us: Can we recognize God's image in someone who is not in my image? Can strangers, even enemies, become friends?''</p>
        <p>The rabbi also struck a note that others at the conference voiced: that religious leaders around the world often have real influence, much more so than politicians.</p>
        <p>''Look at the conflict zones in today's world,'' Rabbi Sacks said, ''and you will see that they coincide almost exactly with zones of religious tension. The question is, Is religion part of the solution, or is it part of the problem? Let none of us doubt the difference we can make.''</p>
        <p>The Dalai Lama and Rabbi Sacks spoke as leading figures within geographically far-flung faith groups, Buddhists and Jews, who were well-represented at the conference.</p>
        <p>Some smaller faiths had, not surprisingly, far fewer representatives.</p>
        <p>The conference drew only a handful of Zoroastrians, for example, members of an ancient religious tradition that emerged in Persia, now Iran, nearly 3,000 years ago. One who came was Dastur Firzone M. Kotwal, a dastur, or high priest, who lives in Bombay, long the major center for the world's Zoroastrians.</p>
        <p>Asked what message his faith could offer the conference, Dr. Kotwal offered a reply drawn from its ethics: ''Zoroastrianism lays stress on a very good standard of morality. Do justice, fairness, honesty and righteousness. When you are standing, lift up the poor. God has given you wealth in excess, use it to help the downtrodden.''</p>
        <p>He estimated the number of Zoroastrians worldwide at about 135,000, nearly half of them in Bombay. ''We never convert,'' he said. ''In this time, this is the best policy. We believe you must follow the religion of your birth and seek salvation from your own religion.''</p>
