        <p>The pianist Orrin Evans creates his sets to leave a lot of room for ad-libbed group interplay, but in his music there is not one single connector between composition and improvisation. There are many: the band is trained to snap back with connective phrases so the listener is kept off balance, wondering about what is undirected and what is premeditated.</p>
        <p>Jazz is working harder these days to provide surprise, which has always been its stock in trade. Mr. Evans's direction is one way that small-group jazz is moving. His explosion of theme-solos-theme structure to put a new improvised structure in its place means a raising of the intuitive stakes.</p>

        <p>The pianist Orrin Evans creates his sets to leave a lot of room for ad-libbed group interplay, but in his music there is not one single connector between composition and improvisation. There are many: the band is trained to snap back with connective phrases so the listener is kept off balance, wondering about what is undirected and what is premeditated.</p>
        <p>Jazz is working harder these days to provide surprise, which has always been its stock in trade. Mr. Evans's direction is one way that small-group jazz is moving. His explosion of theme-solos-theme structure to put a new improvised structure in its place means a raising of the intuitive stakes.</p>
        <p>At the Up Over Jazz Cafe in Park Slope, Brooklyn, last Saturday night, Mr. Evans was accompanied by the bassist Reid Anderson and the drummer Nasheet Waits, with whom he has played a good deal in other people's bands. All three were familiar with one another's methods.</p>
        <p>The set began with Mr. Evans's ''Dorm Life,'' a Monk-like blues that is more a percussive rhythmic suggestion than a tune; it's completely different depending on who is playing it. The band resisted giving it formal shape. Every 30 seconds or so the musicians speeded up or slowed down, but they usually signaled the end of the 12-bar cycle. At a point before the cycle was resolved, the music stopped on a dime, according to a cue that was thoroughly invisible to the audience.</p>
        <p>The tricky ''Don't Fall Off the L.E.J.,'' which started as a ballad and then turned fast and physical, with soloing choruses in a seven-beat rhythmic pattern, made a blueprint for the rest of the set: after a grounding introduction, the band impatiently flew into a crescendo and gradually pulled apart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans's style is sticky, as opposed to smooth: you can sense his love of abruptness and fragmentation in his hard piano style, his insistent repetition of certain notes and phrases.</p>
        <p>Stickiness is the basis, too, of Mr. Waits's extraordinary playing, in which pulse is negotiable, and every number presents an opportunity to play a kind of agitated concerto for snare drum.</p>
        <p>It was physical playing, even too physical, and it routinely overpowered a club as cozy as the Up Over. But it had the freewheeling sharpness of rehearsal, and it was exciting.</p>
