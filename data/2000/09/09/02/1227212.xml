        <p>In Open Teams, the United States began the day leading Qualifying Group B. The team lost unexpectedly  to Greece, 14-16, but bounced back with a 25-0 victory over the Philippines. It retained the lead in the group, in which the scores are:</p>

        <p>9. Greece 252</p>
        <p>In the eighth round Wednesday, the American open team defeated the front-running Australians with considerable help from the diagramed deal.</p>
        <p>North and South were Steve Garner and Howard Weinstein, who reached a highly optimistic seven-heart contract after bidding that requires some explanation. Three no-trump showed slam interest, and four diamonds was Last Train, indicating a willingness to stop in game but some uncertainty. North's five-diamond bid showed three key cards, the heart king and two aces.</p>
        <p>South's five no-trump bid, suggesting seven, and North's acceptance  were both aggressive actions.</p>
        <p>The normal six-heart contract presents some problems, and seven hearts seems impossible. But South found a way. Since East had not doubled five diamonds, he inferred correctly that the diamond king was on his left. He won the opening trump lead in his hand, led the diamond jack, and discarded a club from dummy when West played low.</p>
        <p>He then ruffed his small diamond, cashed the spade ace and ruffed a spade. The diamond ace was cashed, and the diamond queen was ruffed with the heart king.</p>
        <p>Another spade ruff was followed by two trump winners, and West found himself squeezed in the black suits.</p>
        <p>This remarkable effort brought home the grand slam, gained 13 imps for the Americans and proved to be a match winner. They would have lost 17 imps and the match if the grand slam had failed, for in the replay Australia bid and made six hearts.</p>
