        <p>Without so much as a threat of a work stoppage, the new umpires' union has negotiated a new five-year labor agreement and has apparently forged a new relationship with Major League Baseball.</p>
        <p>''I regard it to be a very positive agreement for both sides,'' Rob Manfred, baseball's chief labor relations executive, said yesterday. ''It really lays the foundation for a real good, solid working relationship with this union, something we haven't had in a long time.''</p>
        <p>Late Thursday night, representatives for baseball and the World Umpires Association completed work on the agreement, which must be ratified by the umpires and the club owners, after an intense week of talks at baseball offices in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The agreement, the first negotiated for umpires by someone other than Richie Phillips, the ousted leader of the former union, does not cover the 22 umpires who lost their jobs a year ago today as a result of Phillips's failed resignation strategy.</p>
        <p>Negotiators for the new union had worked out a settlement under which 10 to 13 of the umpires would have regained their jobs as part of the new agreement and the others would have received retirement or severance packages.</p>
        <p>But the unemployed umpires rejected the plan, preferring instead to await the outcome of their arbitration hearing, most likely later this year. The umpires would have had to withdraw their grievance under terms of the proposed settlement.</p>
        <p>The new agreement includes two elements that are new to umpires' labor contracts: an annual escalation in pay and a neutral fact-finder for disciplinary cases.</p>
        <p>In past agreements, the negotiated pay scale remained in place for the life of the deal. In the new agreement, salaries will rise each year. Details were not disclosed in the announcement of the agreement, but one person with knowledge of it said the salary of the most senior umpires would rise from $225,000 in the contract that expired last Dec. 31 to about $250,000 for this year and on to about $340,000 in the fifth year, 2004.</p>
        <p>The establishment of a neutral fact-finder gives the umpires some recourse if they are fired, suspended for more than seven days or fined more than $2,000. Although not on the same level as the impartial arbitrator who decides player challenges to disciplinary action, the fact-finder will determine the underlying facts in a disputed case and report them to a baseball official.</p>
        <p>Findings on dismissals will go to Commissioner Bud Selig and findings on suspensions and fines will go to Sandy Alderson, executive vice president for baseball operations.</p>
        <p>Selig and Alderson will then decide whether the dismissal or discipline was justified. The union had sought the adoption of the arbitration system but settled for the fact-finder.</p>
        <p>A labor expert not involved in the negotiations said a fact-finder is a ''fairly standard device where you can't get independent arbitration but want to get a neutral view.'' The system can be especially helpful to the umpires, the labor expert said, because the findings become public.</p>
        <p>''If the facts are different than stated,'' the person said, ''it would be hard to uphold the disciplinary action.''</p>
        <p>The agreement, the result of six months of negotiations, also includes the creation of a joint committee to establish a new system of training umpires and evaluating them when they work in the major leagues. Evaluation has long been a sore practice with umpires.</p>
        <p>''It's been a long process,'' John Hirschbeck, the union president, said. ''But with the outcome I couldn't be happier for the profession, for all umpires and the working relationship we've established with Major League Baseball.''</p>
        <p>Hirschbeck and the union's other top officials, Joe Brinkman and Tim Welke, were joined in negotiations by two lawyers, Joel Smith and Larry Gibson.</p>
        <p>Hirschbeck and Brinkman led the group of umpires who worked to oust Phillips and the Major League Umpires Association and install a new union. The new union prevailed in a vote conducted last January by the New York office of the National Labor Relations Board.</p>
