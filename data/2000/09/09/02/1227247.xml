      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Two federal appeals court judges today halted the imminent release on bail of Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos scientist accused of mishandling nuclear weapons secrets.</p>
        <p>The delay in Dr. Lee's release, which had been scheduled for noon today, was a result of last-minute maneuvers by prosecutors that provoked charges of deception from defense lawyers at an unusually emotional court hearing here. The prosecutors denied any deception.</p>
        <p>The one-line order from the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver -- ''Release of appellee Wen Ho Lee is stayed pending further order of this court'' --  came as a district court judge in Albuquerque was starting to hear arguments on the prosecution's request that he further delay the release of Dr. Lee.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 24, the district court judge, James A. Parker, reversed an earlier order in which he had denied bail to Dr. Lee based on the government's assertions that he posed a grave threat to national security. In a recent hearing, an F.B.I. agent admitted to having testified incorrectly on several critical issues, making Dr. Lee appear deceptive when he had not been. Also, defense experts disputed the value of the secrets Dr. Lee is charged with illegally downloading from a government computer, prompting Judge Parker to order Dr. Lee released to home detention on $1 million bail. The judge had given  prosecutors until noon to appeal.</p>
        <p>At the noon hearing, when it was expected that the government would announce its appeal, a law clerk strode into the nearly empty courtroom and handed Judge Parker a piece of paper. Upon reading it, the judge announced that the appeals court had already issued an order temporarily halting Dr. Lee's release, circumventing the hearing.</p>
        <p>The order, which appeared to have taken the judge and Dr. Lee's lawyers by surprise, was a clear indication of the intensity of the government's desire to keep Dr. Lee imprisoned before his trial, which is scheduled to begin in November.</p>
        <p>John Cline, one of Dr. Lee's lawyers, leapt to his feet, and stated, ''If they filed something without telling us, I think it's an outrage.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cline explained that he had, as is common, insisted that he receive advance notice of any filing to give him time to respond, and that he had understood the prosecutors would do so. That the prosecutors had apparently done an end run around the defense and the district court here was, Mr. Cline insisted, an abuse of the normal process, under which the appeal would have been filed only after Judge Parker had issued his ruling and the hearing here ended.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cline said he had already prepared a response to any government motion to halt Dr. Lee's release. The motion was now all but useless.</p>
        <p>''That's not the way the system is supposed to work,'' Mr. Cline said, while Dr. Lee, sitting a few feet away, grimaced and closed his eyes.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker responded with the unusual admission that he had  planned to deny the government's request for any further delay in Dr. Lee's release, but that with the appeals court's ruling, it was out of his hands.</p>
        <p>''It is not clear to me that this is any longer under this court's jurisdiction,'' Judge Parker said dryly, and called a recess.</p>
        <p>But the hearing reconvened an hour later, and sparks again flew.</p>
        <p>The second hearing had been requested by the lead prosecutor, George Stamboulidis, to clear up, he said, the impression that he might have misled the defense or the court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stamboulidis explained that the stay, issued by Judges Deanell R. Tacha and David M. Ebel, was done on the appellate court's initiative as the noon deadline loomed. He suggested that the stay had taken him by surprise, too.</p>
        <p>''The government doesn't play dirty pool,'' Mr. Stamboulidis said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cline responded: ''What I think Mr. Stamboulidis has said is half-truths at best. It is part of a pattern of misleading conduct that, I think, is outrageous.''</p>
        <p>To that, Nancy Hollander, another  of Dr. Lee's lawyers, explained that she had just spoken with the clerk of the appeals court in Denver and had been given a different version of events. Ms. Hollander said she was informed that an official with the Department of Justice in Washington had called the court earlier in the day to say that a notice of appeal was being filed shortly in Albuquerque and Denver along with a request for a stay of Dr. Lee's release until the appeal was heard by a three-judge appeals panel. The request for a stay was the one that Judge Parker had already said he was prepared to deny.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hollander said she had requested and was given an assurance that she would be informed of any filings by the government and given a chance to respond. In any case, she said the appeals court judges had acted in response to the government's request, not on their own, as Mr. Stamboulidis had suggested.</p>
        <p>''It is the government circumventing this court and essentially not being truthful,'' Ms. Hollander said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stamboulidis rejected that claim.</p>
        <p>''Disappointment in a result is not justification for taking shots like that,'' he said. ''There was no sneakiness, no inappropriateness.''</p>
        <p>Although the government has insisted in several hearings that Dr. Lee was engaged in what amounted to one of the most serious cases of nuclear espionage ever, he is not charged with spying in the 59-count indictment. He faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment if he is convicted.</p>
        <p>Later today, Mr. Cline and Ms. Hollander faxed to the appeals court a response to the government's actions, noting their anger at what they said was deceptive behavior that violated some of the court's own rules. They asked the court to lift the stay.</p>
        <p>There was no immediate response from the court. The appeals panel is expected to consider motions by the prosecution and defense.</p>
        <p>After expecting to return home for the first time since December, when he was imprisoned, Dr. Lee returned to prison in Santa Fe. The prosecution has said his confinement, in harsh conditions, is essential because of concerns that he might find a way to spirit nuclear secrets to a hostile country.</p>
