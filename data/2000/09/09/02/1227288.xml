        <p>SO Labor Day is upon us, a good time to play those rousing union songs about the steel-driving John Henry and the scabbing Casey Jones and the martyred Joe Hill, who I dreamed I saw last night, alive as you and me.</p>
        <p>Hang on hang on hang on.</p>
        <p>Great as they are, those numbers have more whiskers than your granddaddy. Where are the new labor tunes? Where are the lyrics that speak to a micro-chipped, dot-commed, cell-phoned, video-crazed, Starbucks-bloated world?</p>
        <p>Funny you should ask, because it turns out that there has been a flowering of musical creativity in recent years, inspired by issues like globalization, child labor, downsizing, safety in the work place and jobs heading south thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement. These songs may not have a mass market, but they are around.</p>
        <p>''I would say that nowadays, you probably get more singing than was ever done except maybe in the days of the Wobblies,'' said Joe Glazer. He is known in union circles as ''labor's troubadour,'' having written and performed songs about workers since the 1940's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glazer is chairman of the Labor Heritage Foundation, a group based in Washington that supports the union movement through the arts. The foundation's executive director, Peter Jones, said college campuses are especially friendly territory for today's songwriters. There, you find many who agree that ''society is being divided into the super-rich and those having trouble getting past the minimum wage,'' Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>What are the new songs about? Not Harlan County coal miners, that's for sure. Try repetitive stress injuries.</p>
        <p>Physical pain in the meat-packing industry inspired John O'Connor, an organizer for the New York State Nurses Association, to come up with a number called ''Carpal Tunnel.'' It starts like this:</p>
        <p>''Early in the morning at the start of the day/I force my fingers 'round the handle of the blade/I start to cuttin' just as fast as I can/By the end of the day, I can hardly move my hands.''</p>
        <p>Another New Yorker, Bev Grant, wrote ''No Sweat'' with Pat Humphries. You get the point right away: ''We sew the clothes/ The ones that you buy/We can't afford them for ourselves/The price is too high.''</p>
        <p>And Kirk Kelly, who performed the other day for striking workers at the Museum of Modern Art, has a song called ''Service Economy.''</p>
        <p>''We sweated and we bled, but the jobs we knew have fled/And the workers never got what we deserved,'' it goes. ''Now that you are done, the factories don't run/And the nation doesn't build, it serves.''</p>
        <p>What many new songs have in common with those of yesteryear is sympathy with those who endure ''tedium on the job,'' Mr. O'Connor said.</p>
        <p>''Nothing much has changed,'' he said. ''Maybe you don't strain your back so much now, but you get carpal tunnel syndrome instead. It's the same old song.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly's take was this: ''The exploitation is the same. And the way you build a union is the same. And the reason you build it is the same. It's all about human rights.''</p>
        <p>The trick, Ms. Grant said, is to move people to anger, or to tears, while steering clear of lyrics that sound as if cribbed from a pamphlet.</p>
        <p>''First person is always good,'' she said. ''One of my strengths is that I do work. And I've been on welfare, and grew up poor. So I have enough experience to enrich my writing.''</p>
        <p>Some writers prefer original scores. But melding new words with familiar tunes is a tried-and-true technique to get juices flowing on the picket line. It goes at least as far back as the great labor anthem ''Solidarity Forever,'' written in 1915 to the melody of ''The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''</p>
        <p>Remember ''Stand By Me''? Think of its opening notes accompanying this offering from Julie McCall: ''When the boss calls me in/And the ax is about to fall/And the pink slip is all that I can see/I'm not afraid, no I'm not afraid/'Cause I know the union stands by me.''</p>
        <p>If you know ''After Midnight,'' you can sing this by Mark Levy: ''Afta Nafta, we gonna let your job go down/We gonna import cheaper labor/Send this plant to our southern neighbor/That is what this treaty's all about.''</p>
        <p>It is enough to inspire an amateur to try his own hand at this craft. How about an update of the classic ''Union Maid''?</p>
        <p>''Oh you can't scare me, I'm sticking to the union/I'm sticking to the union, till the day I die/Or till the boss offers me stock options or better health benefits or an I.P.O.''</p>
        <p>On second thought, maybe the act needs more work.</p>
