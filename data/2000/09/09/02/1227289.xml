        <p>One of the thorniest problems facing any New York City school is how to attract good teachers. But for academically troubled schools in the city's most impoverished  neighborhoods, where failure is often the norm, the challenge is even greater.</p>
        <p>So it seemed quixotic when the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, by bureaucratic fiat from Albany, proposed to solve the problem by simply directing all the most qualified teachers who are hired this fall to the nearly 100 schools that are considered the system's worst.</p>
        <p>It turns out that this policy, now supported by a court consent decree negotiated by the state, the teachers' union and the Board of Education, might have the unintended consequence of threatening longstanding yet below-the-surface hiring patterns that allowed the rest of the district's 1,100 schools to do better.</p>
        <p>Over the last week, as teachers seeking jobs in New York City schools have been offered the chance to work in failing schools or nothing, many of them have simply withdrawn, if only temporarily, from the job market. It has become clear that most teachers want to work in easier schools in better neighborhoods, where they are most likely to succeed and feel good about themselves. And there is little the chancellor can do about it, because his ability to deploy teachers where they are most needed is severely limited by the union contract.</p>
        <p>''The system should have a right, especially in emergencies, to put teachers where it needs them,'' said Seymour Fliegel, president of the Center for Educational Innovation, an educational policy group.</p>
        <p>''Take a military situation where there's a battle,'' he said. ''The commander doesn't say, 'Division 1, I would like you to go here; I think it's a very nice place for you.' And Division 1 doesn't say, 'No, we'd like to stay here on the Riviera; why should we go to Kosovo?' ''</p>
        <p>The court order, signed Aug. 24, sets out a series of steps for filling vacancies in the  city schools officially designated as failing, with the goal of ensuring that all teachers in those schools will be certified. A few hundred teaching positions, Mr. Mills said, are affected, out of 70,000 systemwide.</p>
        <p>David Klasfeld, the deputy chancellor, said yesterday that by giving failing schools priority, the order effectively freezes the hiring of certified teachers in other schools, at least until Sept. 7, the first day of school.</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials predicted yesterday that many schools that are marginal, yet not officially designated as failing, would be hurt by the policy. Barred from filling last-minute vacancies with certified teachers, those schools will open, some officials speculated, with substitute teachers at the head of many classes. Students will be hurt by the instability, while permanent teachers, when they finally arrive, may have a hard time asserting control.</p>
        <p>''It's a good idea to raise consciousness about the fact that you need good teachers -- whether certified or not -- in bad schools,'' said Robert Riccobono, a visiting scholar at New York University and former superintendent in District 19, in East New York, Brooklyn. ''But take District 19. There are 26 schools that are not on the failing list,  and every one of them needs new teachers.''</p>
        <p>Officials predicted that some prospective teachers, with the collusion of principals, will try to circumvent the court order, withdrawing from the job market until after Sept. 7, and then going to the school of their choice.</p>
        <p>On the positive side, the order has, perhaps, exposed some of the hypocrisy of the system. It has dramatized that getting good teachers is at the heart of the problem of fixing bad schools, and that there are not  enough talented teachers to go around.</p>
        <p>Although it appears that Mr. Mills is at war with Harold O. Levy, the city's schools chancellor, the state commissioner may in fact be carrying the water for a lot of things that Mr. Levy would like to do, but cannot. When he was first hired in January, Mr. Levy made it clear that he, too, would prefer to have certified teachers in the worst schools.</p>
        <p>But the union contract, officials said, prevents the chancellor from transferring teachers within the system against their will. So the most talented and experienced teachers cannot be told to go to the worst schools, where they might do the most good. The best Mr. Levy can do is threaten not to hire brand new teachers unless they go where they are told to go.</p>
        <p>''The union and the system,'' Mr. Fliegel said, ''have always taken care of the veteran teachers first, and cared the least for the newcomers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fliegel gives Mr. Mills credit for lending a sense of urgency to the job of fixing the worst schools. But the court order has also, he and other educators say, raised ethical questions about how teachers should be recruited and challenged pat assumptions about what makes a good teacher. And it has revealed the complicated devices and tricks that the best schools have used to attract the best teachers and command the most success.</p>
        <p>Nominally, New York City teachers are hired through a civil service system where they are anonymously matched to the next available schools. But in practice, the savviest principals at the best schools have been free to recruit their own teachers and do their own hiring.</p>
        <p>Judith Foster, principal of the Neighborhood School on the Lower East Side, recruits teachers not through Board of Education lists and hiring halls, but through her own newspaper advertising, through word of mouth, and by contacting teachers colleges and asking them to recommend their most promising graduates. Generally, officials said, it is the more troubled schools, which have the hardest time attracting teachers, that still have vacancies in late August. Similarly, the teachers who attend Board of Education hiring fairs tend to be the most desperate: either they have been rejected by the best schools, or they lack the knowledge and ability to work the system to their advantage.</p>
        <p>The culture of failing schools, educators say, is notoriously hard to turn around, and hiring certified teachers may not be enough to do it. It is sometimes better, principals said, to take an uncertified teacher straight out of school who can be molded to the philosophy and culture that the principal wants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mills, on the other hand, argued that certification was an indication of at least minimal qualifications for the job. ''It would never occur to us to have unlicensed nurses, attorneys, certified public accountants or cabdrivers,'' he said.</p>
