        <p>The New York Power Authority plans to spend up to $220 million to buy as many as 11 gas-turbine generators to avert a possible power shortage in New York City next summer.</p>
        <p>The generators are also intended to help stabilize the price of electricity -- which soared this summer in the city -- by increasing the supply.</p>
        <p>The authority's trustees voted  Tuesday to buy the generators, which are the size of tractor-trailers and are housed in steel structures. They are to be placed throughout the city, though the sites have not been chosen, an authority spokesman, Joseph Leary, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The authority's chairman, Clarence D. Rappleyea, said that although there were plans to build power plants in the city, ''the earliest that such projects are expected to be online is the summer of 2002.'' That raises the potential of an ''interim shortfall,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leary said that the gas-turbine units would add 520,000 kilowatts of generating capacity to the more than 10 million available from power plants that supply the city. That addition, he said, was expected to meet the requirement for the 11 million or so kilowatts  that the authority projected would be used in the city on peak-usage  days next summer.</p>
        <p>The generators are to remain even after new power plants are completed, becoming a permanent part of the city's electrical generating system, Mr. Leary said.</p>
        <p>He said that the electricity generated by the new units would be sold to Consolidated Edison and distributed through its system. Con Ed already buys some of the power it distributes from two of the authority's plants, in Queens and at the Indian Point complex in Buchanan, N.Y.</p>
        <p>At least 13 new power plants  across the city have been proposed in recent months by private companies that supply electricity and by local utilities and the Power Authority itself.</p>
        <p>The need to stabilize prices became clear in July when millions of Con Ed customers received bills  that were sharply higher than those of last summer, despite cooler temperatures.</p>
        <p>Under utility deregulation, Con Ed has been required to sell most of its power plants, though it continues to deliver electricity to its customers through its own grid. The company said that the higher bills stemmed from its having to buy electricity on the spot market because of a shortage of power plants locally. Mr. Rappleyea said that the gas-turbine generators could ''help to stabilize prices by providing additional generation as quickly as possible.''</p>
