        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak displayed no anxiety today about reported American concerns that Iraq might be preparing to attack Israel, calmly brushing aside the news that the United States has put a Patriot antimissile battery on alert for possible deployment in Israel's defense.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if this Patriot missile battery really needs to be bothered,'' Mr. Barak said, adding that he did not think Israelis should worry or be distracted by the reports. Indeed, there is no state of alert here, no palpable feeling that there is any cause of concern. The lead story on the evening news was the opening of the new school year.</p>
        <p>American officials confirmed today that the Pentagon had ordered an air defense artillery brigade in Germany to be prepared to move its Patriot antimissile battery to Israel. Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said, ''A decision was made that it would be prudent to put these batteries on a shorter leash time than ordinarily.'' The battery has 64 surface-to-air missiles built to intercept incoming missiles.</p>
        <p>The alert was first reported today in The Washington Post.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether the Pentagon had new information suggesting an imminent attack or was preparing for the possibility that Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, might consider the timing right for a move, with Americans preoccupied by the presidential election campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berger said that he knew of no threat against Israel from Iraq, adding that given ''vituperative statements'' that Mr. Hussein has made against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and the prospect of sending inspectors back into Iraq, the batteries were placed on alert.</p>
        <p>In Israel, an American Embassy official said: ''It's only put on alert -- and publicly put on alert. It's a way to send a message to Saddam Hussein that we're paying attention.''</p>
        <p>If Israel were attacked or threatened by Iraq, it would be unlikely to rely on a Patriot antimissile battery for its defense anyway, military experts say. An earlier model of the Patriot, deployed in Israel during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, proved ineffectual against the 39 Scud missiles that Iraq fired at Israel. In 1998, Israel deployed a new-generation Patriot missile that is said to be better at intercepting missiles.</p>
