        <p>Two federal prosecutors who helped send several Branch Davidians to prison may face prosecution themselves on charges that they withheld information about government actions in the siege at the group's compound near Waco, a lawyer involved in the case said today.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors, Ray Jahn and his wife, LeRoy Jahn, assistant United States attorneys in San Antonio who in 1994 won convictions against eight Branch Davidians in the group's deadly 1993 standoff with federal agents, have been told that they may be indicted by John C. Danforth, the special counsel investigating the government's actions, the lawyer said.</p>
        <p>Michael Kennedy, a lawyer for the former United States attorney Bill Johnston, another Branch Davidian prosecutor and the official whose charges of a possible government cover-up led to the Danforth investigation, said on Wednesday that Mr. Danforth's prosecutors planned to indict Mr. Johnston on charges of perjury, obstruction of justice and making false statements.</p>
        <p>Jan Diltz, a spokesman for Mr. Danforth, declined to comment on any aspect of the investigation or potential indictments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Danforth's recent preliminary report on the Waco matter largely absolved federal officials of wrongdoing. The report said that Mr. Jahn had acknowledged knowing that pyrotechnic tear gas rounds had been used in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's final assault on the Branch Davidians' home but had not revealed that information when he submitted a written statement to Congress in 1995. The report said Mr. Jahn admitted that his statement to Congress was ''false'' but that Mr. Jahn ''claims that he was merely 'negligent' in not disclosing'' that the pyrotechnic rounds had been used.</p>
        <p>The report also said the Jahns had not disclosed the use of pyrotechnics to defense lawyers in the criminal trial.</p>
        <p>The pyrotechnic rounds have become an important element in the continuing controversy over the siege because they could have contributed to the fire that consumed the compound. For years, Department of Justice officials denied the devices had been used at the site, but last year the agency was forced to admit  that some were used when they were found in evidence collected at the scene.</p>
        <p>After the devices were found by the producers of a documentary about the standoff, Mr. Johnston wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno to say that Justice Department officials may have withheld information about their use. Those accusations led to the appointment last year of Mr. Danforth as special counsel.</p>
        <p>Gerald H. Goldstein, a lawyer representing the Jahns, would not comment on the case, saying only, ''Unlike the Danforth commission, which issues press releases and interim reports even before they finish their inquiry, we would prefer to do our talking in the courtroom.''</p>
        <p>The possibility of indictments is the latest development in the continuing investigation into possible government wrongdoing during and after the standoff between the Branch Davidians and federal agents outside of Waco that ended with a fatal fire on April 19, 1993, killing some 80 Davidians.</p>
        <p>The bulk of Mr. Danforth's efforts appears to be focused on Mr. Johnston and what he knew about the F.B.I.'s use of the pyrotechnic rounds.</p>
        <p>Officials familiar with the case say that investigators are focusing on a memorandum saying that Mr. Johnston attended a meeting with other Justice Department officials, in 1993 or 1994, at which the use of rounds was discussed.</p>
        <p>Investigators are also looking at some of the handwritten notes Mr. Johnston made before the 1994 trial of the Branch Davidians. One page includes the note ''incind,'' apparently short for incendiary, which may indicate Mr. Johnston knew something about the use of the devices that he did not reveal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnston later withheld his handwritten notes from Mr. Danforth's investigators because he feared they would be used against him by his enemies within the Department of Justice, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnston has appeared before Mr. Danforth's grand jury twice.</p>
        <p>In 1993, during the 51-day siege, he wrote Ms. Reno to complain that F.B.I. agents had altered important evidence found at the compound. The letter he wrote to Ms. Reno last year ended his career with the federal government. He resigned his post in February.</p>
        <p>The threat of an indictment against Mr. Johnston appears to have caused a rift between Mr. Danforth and Judge Walter Smith Jr. of Federal District Court in Waco. Judge Smith, who is a friend of Mr. Johnston's, is overseeing the Branch Davidians' $675 million wrongful death lawsuit against the federal government.</p>
        <p>When the judge heard that Mr.  Johnston might be indicted, he quickly told investigators who were working for Mr. Danforth inside the federal courthouse in Waco that they could no longer carry their guns into the building, officials in the courthouse said. If the investigators tried to do so, the officials say the judge warned, they were to be arrested.</p>
