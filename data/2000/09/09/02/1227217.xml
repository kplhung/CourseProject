        <p>The afternoon came to a close on the streets of this small Long Island town much the same way it does on any sunny summer day -- with white men in trucks dropping off brown men on the corners, and the brown men walking home with cash in their pockets.</p>
        <p>Although the Suffolk County Legislature narrowly voted down a proposal Thursday night that the county file a federal suit to force the Immigration and Naturalization Service to move against illegal immigrants, the vote did little to calm the tensions in this town of about 15,000.</p>
        <p>And although the Legislature held an emotional public discussion on a proposal to revoke the licenses of contractors that hire undocumented migrant workers from street corners, the contractors were still out today trolling for help. The proposal will be revisited at a later date.</p>
        <p>''There is a booming landscaping and building business going on and there's nobody to do the work,'' said a contractor who was drinking beer at a 7-Eleven and would not give his name. ''Of course I'm going to hire these guys.''</p>
        <p>At the heart of the proposed bill to sue the I.N.S. to enforce illegal immigration laws was the claim that the 1,000 or so undocumented workers who flock to Farmingville each summer to mow lawns and patch roofs have caused a crime wave and that the Hispanic men standing on the street corners waiting for work harass women and young children.</p>
        <p>The bill, sponsored by Joseph Caracappa, a Republican county legislator from Selden, asked that the county be reimbursed an unspecified amount by the I.N.S. for the supposed crimes committed by the undocumented workers. Mr. Caracappa did not return calls left at his office today.</p>
        <p>The Legislature rejected his bill Thursday night by a vote of 9 to 8, with one abstention, at a standing-room-only meeting at the county building in Riverhead, where some Americans shouted, ''Stop the crime!'' and Mexicans held signs that said, ''Stop the Hate'' and ''We Cut Your Grass.''</p>
        <p>At the meeting, the Suffolk County police commissioner, John Gallagher, offered statistics that showed the number of arrests in the precinct that includes Farmingville had actually fallen to 436 in 1999 from 463 in 1995. Moreover, Mr. Gallagher said, the number of noncitizens arrested during that period dropped to 29 from 40.</p>
        <p>''There is no crime wave, period,'' said David Bishop, a Democrat lawmaker from Lindenhurst who voted against the measure. ''The police statistics just don't bear it out. The real goal, I think, was to force the hand of the I.N.S. I see some fear of people who are different than the established population in the area.''</p>
        <p>Mark Thorn, a spokesman for the I.N.S., would say only that ''it is our policy not to comment on any proposed or past legislation.''</p>
        <p>Drawn by wages that can top $15 an hour and brought into the village by smugglers at a cost of $2,000, the workers tried to appear restrained today. But when pressed, they expressed relief.</p>
        <p>''We are not here to make crime,'' said Dionicio Urbina, 20, who comes from the state of Michoacan in central Mexico. ''We are here because we have money problems at home. It would be nice to be brothers, but we have so many problems here.''</p>
        <p>He talked about a county proposal, defeated last year, that would have made it illegal for contractors to stop their vehicles on the streets to hire laborers. This year, the Town of Brookhaven, which includes Farmingville, did pass a law limiting the number of people who may occupy a rental house. To counteract the potential fines, Mr. Urbina's landlord increased the rent by $50 a month for each of the 30 men who live in his house, Mr. Urbina said.</p>
        <p>The day laborers are also picketed every Saturday by a group of Farmingville citizens, demanding that the men go home. The group, known as the Sachem Quality of Life, had pushed Mr. Caracappa to sponsor his unsuccessful bill.</p>
        <p>''I'm tired today,'' said a Sachem group member, Ray Wysolmierski. ''We knew we were up against it, the county suing the country. Our next move is not to let on what we're going to do.''</p>
