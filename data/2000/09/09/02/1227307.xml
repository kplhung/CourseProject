        <p>On an increasing number of occasions, Venus Williams's opponents have timidly stepped on the court and immediately searched for a foxhole. Usually, they duck well behind the baseline, counting on the distance to increase response time, using the extra space as a cushion against Williams's force.</p>
        <p>Maybe, just maybe, she'll miss. But these days, waiting out a mistake by Williams is a high-risk gamble. So the spindly Meghann Shaughnessy arrived at Arthur Ashe Stadium last night with a different strategy. She came with an attack plan.</p>
        <p>''I've seen matches of hers where the other person has been completely intimidated,'' said the 21-year-old Shaughnessy, who is ranked 48th. ''It's easy. She's much bigger, much stronger and hits the ball harder than just about everyone. I know that when I'm playing well, I can stay with players like her. It's just a matter of really believing I can win and that I will win.''</p>
        <p>For an hour, that faith sustained Shaughnessy. For an hour, she stood inside the baseline, came face to face with the helicopter-like blades on Williams's swing and did not flinch.</p>
        <p>Then came the deflating part. When she had a chance to serve for the first set, Shaughnessy could not find her nerve. Williams seized upon Shaughnessy's lapse, watched her opponent's spirits deflate, and went on to take her third-round match, 7-6 (3), 6-1, at the United States Open.</p>
        <p>It was Williams's 22nd consecutive victory, but Shaughnessy's defiant game plan unveiled a blueprint that might succeed against the hottest player in the game.</p>
        <p>''I definitely think she's beatable,'' Shaughnessy said. ''I mean, in that first set there, if I had just served well, who knows what can happen from there? Obviously, she's one of the best players in the game, and she's going to be tough to beat, but I definitely think it's possible.''</p>
        <p>Shaughnessy had proof. When Williams launched a backhand across the net, Shaughnessy took the ball early, converted the force into her own power and crushed it into the corner pockets of the court. When Williams inched toward the net with her intimidating wingspan, Shaughnessy zipped the ball right at her body. Suddenly, Shaughnessy was ahead, 3-0.</p>
        <p>And Williams was in tangles. Under pressure she has rarely experienced during her dominating streak, Williams's serve came unraveled for a moment. She served six double faults in the first set but managed to escape the tie breaker after Shaughnessy sent four straight ground strokes well off target. From there, Shaughnessy began to retreat, and Williams took control.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it was a wake-up call,'' Williams said. ''She did play well to get up, 3-love. It's not like I gave it to her. She hit some nice shots. She had a nice strategy. You expect people to come out and play well in a Grand Slam.''</p>
        <p>Some familiar names were on their games yesterday. Almost a decade ago, Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati arrived at the National Tennis Center as two giggling teenagers who were into stuffed animals, mall trips and pink nail polish. But they quickly belied their pastel-soft exteriors by unleashing ground strokes that were as strong as paint thinner. The year was 1991. In an epic semifinal played out at the United States Open, as one dared to top the other, Seles emerged as the winner. But instead of serving as an appetizer to a decade-long rivalry, the match stamped a date on the end of innocence. By 1993, they had vanished. In the same year that Seles was stabbed during a changeover at a match in Germany, Capriati became a victim of self-destruction.</p>
        <p>Now, they stand out as survivors. They have found their own routes out of dark periods to come back to the tour, then endured jabs about their fitness and doubts about their chances for success. But younger and slimmer players have been ushered out of the Open this week.</p>
        <p>Once again, Seles and Capriati are on their way to a reunion at the center of attention. Seles fought off Chanda Rubin in three sets, and Capriati dismissed Adriana Gersi in 49 minutes, leaving the two to meet in the Round of 16 tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''Certain players, it's strange how you play them always,'' said Seles, who defeated Capriati last year at the Open. ''Certain players, you never get to play them. Jennifer and I have played a lot of matches, more so here.''</p>
        <p>It was not easy for Seles to make this reunion. On a day that was drenched with humidity, she was a little woozy, but able to withstand Rubin in the third set.</p>
        <p>As Day 5 unfolded in the drooping heat, there was Greg Rusedski, laying on his stomach during a grueling five-set loss to the resilient Cedric Pioline, grimacing during an oncourt massage; and there was sixth-seeded Marat Safin, peeling off his shirt and handing the drenched fabric to a fan after withstanding a scare during his five-set victory against Gianluca Pozzi.</p>
        <p>The temperature also extended to Safin's temper. He bounced his racket off the court, cried out to the crowd on misses and grumbled about line calls.</p>
        <p>''When it happens once, O.K.,'' said Safin, referring to the calls. ''Four times, you want to kill the guy. I mean you say to him, 'Pay a little bit attention to the bounces, please.' ''</p>
        <p>Once Safin left the court, and before the rains came to wash out the late match between Mark Philippoussis and Jan-Michael Gambill, everyone's attention was on Williams. She was in trouble but did not seem too concerned. Instead of feeling panic, she dipped into her plentiful reserve of confidence. Just after her escape last night, Williams saw no reason for her streak to end. Can it really go on indefinitely?</p>
        <p>''Sure seems that way,'' Williams said. ''Who do I play next? Magui Serna? I prefer to play a higher-ranked player, but you can't pick the draw.''</p>
        <p>MATCH POINTS</p>
        <p>AMANDA COETZER, seeded 13th, could not navigate the powerful strokes of MAGUI SERNA, who served nine aces on her way to a 7-5, 7-6 (3) upset victory in the third round yesterday. . . . Although top-seeded ANDRE AGASSI and second-seeded GUSTAVO KUERTEN exited before the third round, third-seeded MAGNUS NORMAN continued to get through the draw unscathed. He picked apart CYRIL SAULNIER, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3, on his way to the third round, and he has yet to lose a set. Also advancing to the third round were eighth-seeded ALEX CORRETJA and 14th-seeded NICOLAS KIEFER, who both won in straight sets. . . . MARTINA HINGIS was asked why there are men (namely JOHN McENROE) who feel the need to issue challenges to female players. ''I could say something,'' Hingis said. ''But it's like kindergarten a little bit.''</p>
