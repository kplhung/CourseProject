        <p>Todd Martin was the afternoon headliner on and off the court at Arthur Ashe Stadium yesterday.</p>
        <p>His hair flecked with gray, the 30-year-old Martin was quick to the punch line and the net, serving with understated precision. If his deadpan wit is any measure of a man who is 6 feet 6 inches, Martin has become sharper and more seasoned with age.</p>
        <p>''I've finally mastered a monotone,'' he said somberly. ''It's taken a long time, but I've finally got it.''</p>
        <p>Martin showed more than a mastery of comedic timing yesterday, converting 43 of 44 points on his first serve and rendering 28-year-old Michael Chang flat-footed en route to a second-round victory, 6-4, 6-2, 6-4.</p>
        <p>''It was hard to make a dent in his serve,'' Chang said.</p>
        <p>Theirs was a match from another generation. These men share 25 United States Open appearances and a history of near championships. Chang's missed opportunity came in the final in 1996, at the height of his career, when a victory over Pete Sampras would have meant a No. 1 ranking. This year, Chang was ranked No. 24 in the world but made his third straight second-round exit at the Open. His 1989 victory at the French Open remains his only Grand Slam title.</p>
        <p>Martin, ranked 33rd, was last year's runner-up to Andre Agassi, and yesterday's performance showed that his game is climbing. Martin scored only his second victory in seven meetings against Chang, but it was the first time they have played since 1997.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say my game has changed a lot; I'm still right-handed,'' Martin said. ''I really feel like I'm a better tennis player. I don't do some things as well, but the general package is a smarter player.''</p>
        <p>Martin, who noted that Northwestern University would probably not allow him to enroll again based on the grade point average he had for two years, had some high marks yesterday. He won the point 90 percent of the time when he approached the net. ''Each and every year I develop a greater level of confidence at the net,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Chang had nothing but praise for Martin. ''With Todd, his game is so simple,'' Chang said. ''If you ever look at his strokes, his techniques, there's not much to it. He keeps things very simple, no extra movement, no wild, fancy stuff. He's just pretty much straight-up, good, basic, fundamental tennis.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes those fundamentals disappear. At Wimbledon in the second round this year, Martin was up by 5-1 in the fifth set against Agassi before losing. It was nearly a replay of Martin's 1996 Wimbledon semifinal loss to MaliVai Washington.</p>
        <p>But just last year at the Open, Martin recovered from a 4-1 deficit in the fifth set of a fourth-round match against Greg Rusedski, after which he required two liters of intravenous fluids. Yesterday, a reporter began to ask Martin if he bristled at the suggestion that he chokes since the Rusedski match showed that he has the ability to come back.</p>
        <p>''Does it irritate you . . .'' the reporter began, when Martin jumped in: ''When people compliment my serve after a good match? Yes.'' Martin also admitted that he is working on his late-match confidence.</p>
        <p>He will not have a rematch with Rusedski, who lost to Cedric Pioline yesterday, 6-7 (4), 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (6), 6-3. ''It is nice to occasionally recall some of those emotions I felt last year,'' Martin said. ''It's great to know that I'm in the process of doing it again.''</p>
        <p>Martin is advancing despite his lack of match play this year. He tore ligaments in his left ankle while playing basketball in February and did not play again until the French Open warm-up in Rome. He was just 4-4 in matches since Wimbledon, but yesterday Martin relied on experience.</p>
        <p>''I think a lot of it has to do with what I've learned and what I do differently than I did when I was in my 20's,'' said Martin, who turned 30 on July 8. ''Each and every year, about 20 new players that are in their teens come up and start beating up on us. I feel old, but I don't feel elderly. I feel like I've aged, and I feel like I've more or less improved with age. I still get a little kid's feeling when I go out and play the little kid's game.''</p>
        <p>He plays with maturity but speaks with more than a little levity. A reporter was trying to ask him about his wit when Martin cut off the angle again. The reporter's question began: ''Many people in the press corps feel that . . .'' when Martin chimed in, a wry smile forming on his face: ''I'm the greatest guy in the world? Thanks.''</p>
