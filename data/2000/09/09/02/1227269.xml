        <p>Officials of an independent commission that organizes the presidential debates told aides to Gov. George W. Bush yesterday that they would not revise the locations or schedules for three debates in October that the Bush campaign had sought to modify.</p>
        <p>Janet Brown, executive director of the Commission on Presidential Debates, said that the panel's position was spelled out at a meeting in Washington with Joseph Allbaugh, the Bush campaign manager, and two other Bush lieutenants involved in debate preparations. Ms. Brown said she told the Bush officials that the arrangements were far too advanced and the job of ensuring network coverage too complex for the process to be tampered with.</p>
        <p>''We discussed the extensive work that has already been done,'' she said. ''And we underscored things like the difficulty of this fall's television schedule, with the Olympics scheduled for so late in the year.''</p>
        <p>Bush campaign officials have recently indicated that they are not happy with some aspects of the debates organized by the bipartisan commission, which has supervised the presidential debates since 1988. They have said their objections include the plan to broadcast all three debates in prime time, and the holding of the first debate at the University of Massachusetts in Boston because the location is adjacent to the John F. Kennedy Library, an institution commemorating a Democratic president.</p>
        <p>Asked yesterday why he was reluctant to agree to the commission debates, Mr. Bush said, ''I'm looking at the options. You know, it seems like to me that there will be some really interesting formats other than what we're told will have to be the format.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's resistance is the sticking point in the October showdowns. Vice President Al Gore has already agreed to the commission's proposals; in fact, he has accepted invitations to more than 50 debates, though his campaign chairman, William M. Daley, added the stipulation yesterday that Mr. Bush must consent to the commission debates before other offers would be entertained.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Bush, meanwhile, have been exploring other options, meeting with officials of broadcast and cable networks this week to discuss debate formats.</p>
        <p>In a letter to the candidates on Thursday, Tom Johnson, the chairman of CNN, proposed Larry King as the moderator of a first debate, to be produced by his network.</p>
        <p>''One could not ask for a fairer, more balanced, more enthusiastic moderator,'' Mr. Johnson wrote.</p>
        <p>Other television networks have made similar approaches on behalf of their news broadcasters.</p>
        <p>Mr. King might well be the gentle sort of inquisitor that the Bush camp seeks. Mr. Bush is said to prefer formats in which the candidates can converse, rather than formally debate -- an activity at which Mr. Gore is generally thought to be the more skilled. Mindy Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman, would say only that CNN's proposal was ''one of the many letters that have come in.''</p>
        <p>But it is unlikely that one network would win such a coveted designation, because Mr. Gore -- who met yesterday in Nashville with Mr. Daley and others advising him on debate preparations -- says the commission's debates are his priority.</p>
        <p>''We believe the commission schedule is the best way to conduct debates, so that they are seen by the most people on free television,'' said Mark Fabiani, the Gore campaign's communications director. ''Once the Bush campaign agrees to the commission's presidential debates, we then would be pleased to consider these other opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brown said she told Mr. Bush's representatives that the commission had always been open to employing varying formats for the debates, which are to occur on Oct. 3 in Boston; Oct. 11 in Winston-Salem, N.C., and Oct. 17 in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>She added that the panel would consider Mr. Bush's proposal that a second vice-presidential debate be scheduled.</p>
