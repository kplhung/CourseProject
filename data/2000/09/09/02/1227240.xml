      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Scott Stapp obviously thinks he deserves to be a rock god. The frontman for Creed, the Florida-based band that packed Madison Square Garden on Monday and plays a sold-out show tomorrow at Jones Beach, works to project the aura of a champion.</p>
        <p>At the Garden, in a gleaming white shirt and leather hip-huggers that would have delighted his idol, Jim Morrison, Mr. Stapp made so many heroic moves, it seemed as if this was his qualifying routine for the frontman olympics. He pranced and crouched and swept his arms heavenward, straining his enormous baritone, a foghorn warning all contenders to watch out for his wake.</p>

        <p>Scott Stapp obviously thinks he deserves to be a rock god. The frontman for Creed, the Florida-based band that packed Madison Square Garden on Monday and plays a sold-out show tomorrow at Jones Beach, works to project the aura of a champion.</p>
        <p>At the Garden, in a gleaming white shirt and leather hip-huggers that would have delighted his idol, Jim Morrison, Mr. Stapp made so many heroic moves, it seemed as if this was his qualifying routine for the frontman olympics. He pranced and crouched and swept his arms heavenward, straining his enormous baritone, a foghorn warning all contenders to watch out for his wake.</p>
        <p>The Garden audience clearly supported his victory bid. Roaring along so enthusiastically that Mr. Stapp could regularly take microphone breaks and let them take over songs, Creed's fans reached their zenith on ''Higher,'' which rivals Santana's ''Smooth'' as the people's song of the moment. Audience members didn't just sing: they emoted, some nearly weeping, others raising their hands as if undergoing a conversion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stapp was raised in the Pentecostal faith, and although he says he is not a practicing Christian, his lyrics resound with a doubting Thomas's fear of God. ''Higher,'' which he says is about lucid dreaming, still has a decidedly biblical chorus about golden streets where blind men see. Such images are the meat of Christian popular culture and have contributed to the band's phenomenal success.</p>
        <p>That success is evident in the numbers. Creed's two albums, ''My Own Prison'' (1998) and ''Human Clay'' (1999), have sold a total of nearly 10 million copies, each spending almost a year on the Billboard charts. ''Higher'' is still in the Top 20 singles after 44 weeks, despite having never been officially released in that form.</p>
        <p>The sales are all the more notable because the band records for an independent label, Wind-Up, as do the much-touted teenage stars on Jive and the hip-hop artists on Cash Money and No Limit.</p>
        <p>Yet the praise the music business usually offers its cash cows eludes Creed. The group has won awards from industry publications like Billboard and technical magazines like Guitar World. But it has no Grammy, boasts only one nomination at next week's MTV Video Music Awards and has received middling-to-poor reviews in most publications. Even Spin's recent cover story on the band mustered only faint praise.</p>
        <p>Creed has not fared much better among its peers. Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit started a feud with Mr. Stapp when both bands performed at a KROQ-sponsored festival this summer, calling him an egomaniac. On its recent tour the pop-punk band Blink 182 made fun of Creed every night.</p>
        <p>And so Creed has become the latest rock pariah. Self-righteousness is part of its problem. Hipsters have little sympathy for spiritual quests, especially those that bear the mantle of Christianity. Mr. Stapp's lyrics, which have at times been anti-abortion and anti-affirmative action, don't help. Yet religious faith is hardly unusual in music. Lauryn Hill made a profoundly pious 1998 debut album and swept every awards ceremony. Even the pornography-loving members of Blink 182 embrace Christianity in interviews.</p>
        <p>Nor is it fair to say that Creed just makes bad music. The group's metallic rock plunders the outdated grunge style, but the guitarist Mark Tremonti has his own ethereal approach. Mr. Stapp's lyrics are overblown, but plenty of simplistic pop gets a big thumbs up from the overextended, product-hungry media.</p>
        <p>The problem with Creed is that Mr. Stapp is a true believer: perhaps not in Jesus, but in himself, and in the rock 'n' roll he discovered when he fled his church as a young man. He embodies the belief that rock music can change lives; it changed his, after all. He refuses to take it lightly. To many, his furtive embrace of rock cliches makes him a clown.</p>
        <p>Pop music now runs on an engine of subtle self-loathing. Its movers and shakers agree to believe that this is a degraded realm. Plastic teenage pop is admired for being calculated. Sexist and homophobic lyrics in hard rock and hip-hop are justified because they are offered in the spirit of a joke. The more self-consciously trivial an artist can be, the better: he will make for a better punch line on MTV or VH1.</p>
        <p>Earnestness is not completely dead. Artists like Bruce Springsteen or U2 have earned emeritus status and get away with it. Young geniuses like D'Angelo and Ms. Hill can be serious about soul music because of their sheer musicality. A few bands have taken up the countercultural torch, notably Rage Against the Machine and Pearl Jam. These groups survive the occasional jab because their fan base so strongly supports them.</p>
        <p>Every so often, though, a group like Creed plods into the spotlight, with not a whit of redeeming grooviness, and triumphs. Such successes shine a harsh light on a void: the lack of sympathy for better artists whose passions mount as high. The belief that popular music can raise consciousness is old hat. Everyone agrees, except the 10 million people, most more conservative than countercultural, who love Creed.</p>
        <p>The rise of Christian rock, by that or any other name, is a major story. Those who find Creed's pieties troubling might note that outside the periscope of fashionable pop, such sentiments are everywhere. The voices raised along with Mr. Stapp's prove that faith is still a strong force for change. But that faith need not only be self-righteous. It could as easily be pagan, radical and anarchistic. It can take as many forms as the culture industry allows.</p>
