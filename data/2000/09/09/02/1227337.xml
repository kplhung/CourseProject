        <p>The top two teams in the group will join the top two from two other groups in North and Central America and the Caribbean in a round-robin tournament next year to determine the three countries that will represent the region in the final stages of the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea.</p>
        <p>Mexico, Jamaica, Honduras and Trinidad and Tobago are the favorites to join the two countries that will move on from the group that includes the United States.</p>
