        <p>ALTMAN-David R. On August 30, 2000 in New York City. David loved life. Beyond all others, he made the everyday extraordinary. He found joy where others could not see it. He turned strangers into friends and friends into family. And then there is Floria. His wife, his life, of over 53 years. Floria and David. David and Floria. One and the same. Emily &amp; Dara had the matchless chance to be his children, with Floria, the loves of his life. He made his sons-inlaw, Michael Lennon and Michael Kahan, his sons. He cherished his grandchild Asher. He was dearest brother-in-law, more like brother, to Melvin Lasky. Brother-in-law to Joyce Lasky Reed. Incomparable uncle and great-uncle to Rosalind, Richard, Lionel, Samantha, Vivienne, Rachel, Adam, Oliver, Amanda, Nicholas, Sasha &amp; Carla. David walked among us and left very large footprints. We are fortunate to have walked with him. In memory of David R. Altman and in honor of Dr. David R. Schwartz for the benefit of the Medical Intensive Care Unit contributions may be made to Tisch Hospital, NYU Medical Center, Development Office, in care of Myra Biblowit, 550 First Ave, New York, NY 10016.
