        <p>The dream of a defense against ballistic missiles goes all the way back to the Eisenhower era. But it was in the thunder and flame of the gulf war, the world's first antimissile war, that support grew for the kind of system that the Clinton administration was considering.</p>
        <p>After the Republicans won control of Congress six years ago, momentum to field such a weapon grew rapidly. By 1996 the administration began an effort to ready a limited missile defense for deployment, its price tag eventually put at $60 billion.</p>
        <p>The range of its nonnuclear warheads was to be much greater than the old ground-based interceptors, because it was ''smart,'' small and lightweight. In theory at least, interceptors at one base could, for the first time, race out of their silos to defend the whole nation from an attack of up to a few dozen warheads.</p>
        <p>After being launched into space by a rocket, the so-called Exo-Atmospheric Kill Vehicle was to guide itself toward a target, using its tiny computer to analyze sensor readings and fire thrusters.</p>
        <p>From the start, the big challenge was whether it could ignore the decoys among the nuclear warheads that an enemy would inevitably deploy to outwit the defense system. The sensor was to be smart enough to pick the real warhead from the clutter, seeking out its heat rays. Then, zipping along at about two miles per second, the kill vehicle was to slam into the warhead and demolish it by force of impact.</p>
        <p>Experts, including some from the antimissile industry itself, said the plan would never work.</p>
        <p>Test flights began in 1997. Mock warheads were always launched into space from California, and interceptor rockets from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. The first two tests studied only sensor accuracy, the interceptors flying nearby to look at mock warheads among decoys.</p>
        <p>Then came intercept tests, the first last October. The Pentagon hailed the experiment as an unqualified success but later acknowledged that the kill vehicle had initially drifted off course and picked out a decoy rather than the warhead.</p>
        <p>In the second test, in January, the interceptor missed the target altogether because of a sensor coolant leak.</p>
        <p>The third try, in July, was meant to be the last before President Clinton's deployment decision. It, too, was a disappointment. The second stage of the two-stage interceptor failed to release the kill vehicle, and the two tumbled out of control.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's announcement yesterday that he had decided to pass the contentious issue on to his successor is likely to produce very different results depending on who wins the White House.</p>
        <p>Deploying space arms could cost hundreds of billions of dollars. So far all of the efforts over the decades have been nothing short of colossal and have cost more than $130 billion, according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a private group in Washington.</p>
        <p>The allure of space arms is that they could, in theory, hit rising missiles before they release payloads of warheads, chaff, balloons and other decoys, increasing the odds of success and offering protection against large strikes. But there are countermeasures, and global coverage could be hard.</p>
        <p>The idea for a national missile defense began in the late 1950's when President Eisenhower, facing the prospect of Soviet missile fleets, embarked on a secretive crash program of antimissile research that included ideas for space-based arms and in time involved thousands of the nation's top scientists.</p>
        <p>By the mid 1960's, designers had settled on a less ambitious approach that involved ground-based interceptors tipped with nuclear arms. In war, these were to thunder out of their underground silos and race skyward to battle incoming waves of enemy warheads, in theory incinerating them in nuclear fireballs.</p>
        <p>The Johnson administration, trying to seize a Republican issue before the 1968 presidential election, proposed plans for deploying such interceptors.</p>
        <p>But it was the Nixon administration that actually built them. Switched on in North Dakota in October 1975, the Safeguard system was meant to shield nearby missile fields from a disarming first strike. But the $25 billion weapon was abandoned after just 133 days as strategists concluded that Moscow could overwhelm it with a rush of new warheads then being fastened atop new missiles.</p>
        <p>The fear of just such costly spirals of antimissile action and reaction prompted Moscow and Washington in 1972 to sign the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which in time limited each side to one interceptor site. No matter how good the interceptors, experts reasoned, these single sites would be unable to defend large territories.</p>
        <p>The goal in hobbling defense was to reinforce the idea that all sides would lose in a nuclear war and thus to deter such an apocalypse.</p>
        <p>President Reagan's Star Wars plan, announced in 1983, was meant to see if enemy missiles could be rendered ''impotent and obsolete.'' The program pursued weapons that were quite advanced, including lasers and particle beams, and proposed to base them in space.</p>
        <p>That step sought to extend the antimissile reach beyond the range of ground-based interceptors and to produce many lines of defense, so in theory a shield might be nearly leakproof, even in a downpour.</p>
        <p>By 1989, after many programmatic zig and zags, and failures, a less futuristic and more realistic space weapon was proposed. Called Brilliant Pebbles, it was hailed as so cheap and small that as many as100,000 of them could be shot into orbit, always ready to ruin rising enemy missiles by force of impact.</p>
        <p>But as the cold war ended, political support for such plans evaporated. All the orbital arms initiatives came crashing back to earth after an expenditure of tens of billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Not until the gulf war, when waves of Patriot interceptors sought to blast short-range Iraqi Scuds out of the sky, did hopes revive for a missile defense system in the United States. That fiery duel in the Persian Gulf war helped build support for more advanced kinds of ground-based interceptors, including ones for nationwide defense.</p>
