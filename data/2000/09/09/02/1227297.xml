        <p>A St. Louis manufacturer agreed today to pay $192,500 to settle a civil rights suit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of eight Hispanic workers who were required to speak only English while on the assembly line. The settlement was the largest involving an English-only policy since the agency began tracking the practice among employers four years ago.</p>
        <p>The eight workers, employees of the Watlow Electric Manufacturing Company's radiator plant in Batavia, Ill., a Chicago suburb, will share the settlement, which provides back pay for seven who either quit or were fired as a result of the policy, as well as punitive damages.</p>

        <p>A St. Louis manufacturer agreed today to pay $192,500 to settle a civil rights suit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on behalf of eight Hispanic workers who were required to speak only English while on the assembly line. The settlement was the largest involving an English-only policy since the agency began tracking the practice among employers four years ago.</p>
        <p>The eight workers, employees of the Watlow Electric Manufacturing Company's radiator plant in Batavia, Ill., a Chicago suburb, will share the settlement, which provides back pay for seven who either quit or were fired as a result of the policy, as well as punitive damages.</p>
        <p>There is no federal law specifically prohibiting businesses from adopting English-only rules. Rather, the E.E.O.C. has sued to overturn some by invoking Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a provision that bars employment discrimination based on national origin.</p>
        <p>While the agency deems some such policies to have a sufficient basis -- to help maintain job safety by ensuring clear communication, for instance -- the suit against Watlow said that its employees had been unfairly disciplined for speaking Spanish to one another. One woman, it said, was fired simply for greeting another employee in Spanish.</p>
        <p>''Companies are finally learning a lesson about what they can and can't do with respect to requiring workers to speak English,'' said Jose J. Behar, the agency's main lawyer on the case.</p>
        <p>Watlow conceded no wrongdoing, saying it was settling to avoid costly litigation. Ed Jepson, a lawyer for the company, said that a third of the Batavia plant's workers were Hispanic and that the English-only rule had been adopted to improve communication on the assembly line. It never applied to any worker who was away from the line, Mr. Jepson said.</p>
        <p>''The company was having trouble with productivity and quality control because people weren't talking to each other,'' he said. ''This is a company that values diversity and encourages diversity.''</p>
        <p>The suit was filed in March 1999 and stemmed from a 1997 staff meeting where management distributed a two-page ''performance initiative,'' said Mr. Behar, of the E.E.O.C. Among ways to improve productivity, the document listed a ban on employees' speaking anything but English while working.</p>
        <p>The move provoked instant opposition from a handful of employees, three of whom were suspended and eventually fired for refusing to comply, Mr. Behar said. Ultimately, he said, all but one of the eight workers involved in the suit left the company.</p>
