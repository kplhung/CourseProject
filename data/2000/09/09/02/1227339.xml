        <p>Andre Reed, whose 941 receptions are second to Jerry Rice on the National Football League career list, left the Denver Broncos yesterday in hopes of finding a team in need of an experienced wide receiver.</p>
        <p>Broncos Coach Mike Shanahan told reporters he thought Reed was retiring after 15 seasons, but Reed's agent said that was not the case.</p>
        <p>''That whole thing with retiring was a miscommunication,'' the agent, Gary uberstine, said. ''They've since talked and cleared it all up. He's not retiring and Mike has granted him his release so he can pursue a more immediate opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Reed's departure came a few days after Shanahan told the receiver he would not be in uniform for Denver's season opener Monday night against St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Reed, who signed with the Broncos on the eve of training camp in June, narrowly made Denver's roster and was buried on the depth chart behind Ed McCaffrey, Rod Smith, Robert Brooks and Travis McGriff.</p>
        <p>Despite his situation, Reed seemed comfortable playing a backup role. When asked earlier this week about the prospect of watching from the sideline, Reed said he was willing to be patient if it meant a chance to win a championship.</p>
        <p>Although encouraged by Reed's positive attitude, Shanahan told him to think about his decision during the week. Two days of practice apparently prompted Reed to change his mind.</p>
        <p>Reed, 36, was the primary target for most of his career in Buffalo, catching 941 passes for 13,095 yards and 86 touchdowns. He was selected to seven Pro Bowls and played in four Super Bowls, but left the Bills saying he wanted a chance for more playing time.</p>
        <p>Uberstine said Reed has not received any immediate offers from another N.F.L. team. Depending on injuries to the Broncos and other teams after the first week of the season, Reed was hoping to get one more chance.</p>
        <p>''If this is the best opportunity out there, he's content to not participate,'' Uberstine said. ''It wasn't looking for greener pastures. He wasn't comfortable with not contributing on any basis.''</p>
        <p>CASE TO START FOR LIONS: Charlie Batch tried to talk himself into starting at quarterback for the Detroit Lions yesterday. In the end, his better judgment won out.</p>
        <p>Batch informed Lions Coach Bobby Ross yesterday morning that he would not be able to play against the New Orleans Saints tomorrow, meaning Stoney Case will start.</p>
        <p>''I left the deicsion up to Charlie, and he told me that he wouldn't be able to play,'' Ross said. ''He just didn't think his knee was strong enough. I'll support that decision fully.''</p>
        <p>Batch broke a bone in his right knee on June 5, and missed all of training camp and the preseason. As late as Monday, he said he felt that he would be able to play if he got medical clearance.</p>
        <p>BROWNS SIGN PEDERSON: Quarterback Doug Pederson, who considered retiring after being released by the Philadelphia Eagles, signed a two-year contract with the Cleveland Browns yesterday.</p>
        <p>Pederson started nine games last year for the Eagles before being benched in favor of the rookie Donovan McNabb. Pederson was booed mercilessly by Philadelphia fans, and the experience left the seven-year veteran contemplating retirement.</p>
        <p>However, after getting a call from the Browns, Pederson talked it over with his wife and decided to go to Cleveland.</p>
