        <p>''The rules have been broken; one of your kind has gone renegade,'' the good guy immortal, Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), of the clan MacLeod, is told in ''Highlander: Endgame.'' The evil immortal, Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne), has gone on a rampage. And such an earthshaking event hasn't transpired on Earth since, well, since the last ''Highlander'' movie, when the evil immortal Kane had to be stopped by good guy Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert), of the clan MacLeod.

        <p>Although ''Endgame''is only 95 minutes long, there is so much exposition that some may find it as confusing as the Samuel Beckett play of the same name. In the ''Highlander'' mythology immortals walk the earth; they modestly refer to themselves as ''the seeds of legend.'' Each time one is killed in battle -- his head has to be cut off, leading to a light show that could be right out of an Ozzy Osbourne concert -- his spirit and power enter the victor. I'm sure there's a lengthy monograph on the homoeroticism of ''Highlander'' somewhere at the Sorbonne, and ''Endgame'' lets Kell jokingly allude to it. This may be the only thing that will keep those unaware of the ''Highlander'' mythology interested.</p>
        <p>The mythology began in the 1986 fantasy film ''Highlander,'' which has the distinction of being one of the most overdirected films of that decade. The camera flies around so much you assume the camera operators were being paid by the mile. Mr. Lambert starred in the sequels, which lost whatever sprightliness the first one had, perhaps because that quality was embodied by Sean Connery, playing Mr. Lambert's mentor and, more absurdly, a Spaniard with a Scottish lilt. (The inappropriate accents are a big part of ''Highlander''; Connor seems to have been singled out to be an immortal because he has the least convincing Scottish accent in the country.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Connery's gargantuan, jovial presence -- he seemed to be in on some private joke -- was glimpsed briefly in the second ''Highlander,'' where he had a cameo that was such a brazen attempt to bring in an audience that he seemed to be cashing his check on the set. The other sequels have become increasingly grim and dolorous; it's no fun having to live forever. That's the theme of ''Endgame.'' And to set up this picture the producers use endless flashbacks, because the audience unfamiliar with ''Highlander'' movies and the spinoff television series, in which all of the immortals seemed to have moved to Canada, have to be brought up to speed.</p>
        <p>Connor, looking about as miserable as anyone who has lived for several centuries can, has gone into seclusion for 10 years, a revelation that means the movie sequels apparently never took place, since they were set in the 1990's. (''Endgame'' doesn't even bother to be consistent with its own phony past.)</p>
        <p>He leaves the sanctuary, called Sanctuary no less, to join Duncan so that together they can keep Kell from being the last surviving immortal. (The immortal creed is, There can be only one!) There's so much exposition that Mr. Paul, whose impish Duncan was the protagonist of the television spinoff, doesn't even appear until 10 minutes into the action.</p>
        <p>And the action is the best thing in the picture, taking place in warehouses and abandoned buildings that make the film look like an Einsturzende Neubauten stage show. It's nice to see mindless violence back in a B picture, where it belongs, and the swordplay is impressive.</p>
        <p>When ''Highlander'' sticks to the hand-to-hand battles and doesn't try to offer deeper thoughts on the life of an immortal, it works on its own terms. (No one explains how the two Britons, Connor and Duncan, learned sword-fighting techniques that look Japanese, but it's probably pointless to ask too many questions here.)</p>
        <p>''Highlander: Endgame'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes violence, including decapitations of immortals, and brief nudity.</p>
