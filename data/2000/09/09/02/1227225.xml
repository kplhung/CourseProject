        <p>Editorial praises US Open for being only Grand Slam tennis tournament to allot equal prize money to men and women</p>

        <p>It may not have Wimbledon's all-white dress code or perfectly manicured grass, but the United States Open is the classiest of all Grand Slam tennis tournaments. That is because the tournament, currently being played in Queens, is the only one to allot equal prize money to men and women.</p>
        <p>This gender equity is significant far beyond the tournament and the game's professional circuit.  Prizing the women's competition equally sends a strong message to millions of aspiring young girls: Your athletic pursuits are no less significant than those of your male schoolmates.</p>

        <p>It may not have Wimbledon's all-white dress code or perfectly manicured grass, but the United States Open is the classiest of all Grand Slam tennis tournaments. That is because the tournament, currently being played in Queens, is the only one to allot equal prize money to men and women.</p>
        <p>This gender equity is significant far beyond the tournament and the game's professional circuit.  Prizing the women's competition equally sends a strong message to millions of aspiring young girls: Your athletic pursuits are no less significant than those of your male schoolmates.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, the United States Open has been awarding equal prize money to women for more than 25 years. But this can no longer be considered a form of social engineering, or paternalistic altruism. The fact is, the tournament's female players  have become a stronger draw. For three straight years the women's championship match has garnered higher TV ratings than the men's. The men's game has been in a bit of a slump of late, while fans are engrossed by the intense rivalries and fine playing of Martina Hingis, the Williams sisters, Lindsay Davenport, Mary Pierce, Monica Seles and others.</p>
        <p>John McEnroe, the game's enduring enfant terrible, acknowledged women's enhanced marketing muscle when he quipped to The New Yorker last month that the men may eventually have to sue for equal pay. We hope it never comes to that. That would send the wrong message to millions of aspiring young boys.</p>
