        <p>New Jersey reported its first human case of infection with the West Nile virus yesterday, while New York reported its seventh, in a 61-year-old Staten Island man.</p>
        <p>Health officials in New Jersey said a 43-year-old Jersey City man was hospitalized last month with a headache and a 100-degree fever. Yesterday, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed a finding by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services that the virus had been detected in the man's blood and spinal fluid.  Health officials did not identify the man, but said he had been discharged from the hospital.</p>
        <p>The most recent victim in New York has also returned home, said Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city health commissioner, at a news conference yesterday. The man, who was not identified, lives in the Woodrow section of Staten Island, officials said. He was found to be infected after he was admitted to a hospital complaining of muscle fatigue and was given a diagnosis of encephalitis, a potentially fatal inflammation of the brain.</p>
        <p>Of the six other people infected in New York, only one, an 87-year-old Brooklyn woman who suffered seizures and lapsed into a coma shortly after becoming infected, remains hospitalized, city health officials said. The woman, still in critical condition, is also the only victim who does not live on Staten Island, which has become the epicenter of this year's West Nile outbreak.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen said New York City would continue efforts to combat the virus by spraying pesticides in areas where large numbers of infected mosquitoes have been trapped.</p>
        <p>On Staten Island, the city has found 67 such areas, compared with 7 in Manhattan, 3 in Queens and 2 in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Though the number of cases confirmed this year continues to lag behind the 10 cases reported by this time last year, health officials urged caution and said they were not ready to declare their strategy a success, especially with hundreds of thousands of people expected to be outdoors over the Labor Day weekend.</p>
        <p>''Since the past few weeks have been the peak time of the mosquito season,'' Dr. Cohen said, ''it would not be unexpected if we were to learn of additional cases.''</p>
        <p>Kristine Smith, a spokeswoman for the New York State Health Department, added: ''It was just about this time last year that we started discovering cases. It's certainly too soon to now say we have this thing beaten. We've got be vigilant for a number of more weeks.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, New Jersey health officials continue to discover infected birds, including 469 dead crows and one cockatiel so far. The state is awaiting tests on blood and spinal fluid from 19 people who have recently become ill and live near areas where the birds were found.</p>
        <p>In the face of yesterday's news, New Jersey health officials urged people not to panic. Instead, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the state health department, ''take the precautions.''</p>
