        <p>SPAIN: JUDGE INDICTS ARGENTINE -- Judge Baltasar Garzon indicted a former Argentine military officer on charges of genocide, torture and terrorism, acts he said were committed under Argentina's military government two decades ago. Judge Garzon, who led a drive to extradite the former Chilean dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, on human rights charges, acted after hearing testimony from Argentines in Europe who said they were tortured by the officer, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, pictured here. Mr. Cavallo is in Mexico awaiting possible extradition to Spain.</p>

        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: TROOP EXERCISES -- An elite Yugoslav Army unit whose stated goal is to return to the NATO-controlled Serbian province of Kosovo held war games in Petlovo Bojiste, Serbia, a show of force apparently meant to improve President Slobodan Milosevic's tarnished image ahead of elections. Backed by more than 200 tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters, about 1,000 infantry troops exercised with live ammunition in rain and fog before Yugoslav generals and a dozen foreign diplomats. The army's chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, reminded the troops that last year's Kosovo peace agreement between Yugoslavia and the United Nations permits the eventual return of Yugoslav forces. The agreement led to the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops and the deployment of NATO-led peacekeepers in June 1999.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: SPEED BLAMED IN SUBWAY ACCIDENT -- The derailment of a Paris subway car on Thursday was probably caused by excessive speed, investigators said, contradicting earlier reports. The speed limit on the curve leading into the station at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette was 19 miles an hour, and the train was going about 22 m.p.h. A national radio station reported that the driver, still not identified, had been disciplined several times for speeding. Twenty-four passengers were injured.</p>

        <p>GREECE: ULTIMATUM ON RELIGIOUS ID'S -- Prime Minister Costas Simitis vowed to press ahead with a decision to remove religious affiliation from new state identity cards despite a threat by the Greek Orthodox Church to mount a mass petition drive for a national referendum on the issue. The church, which led protest rallies in June, has given the government until midnight Sept. 14 to begin talks on the decision.</p>

        <p>CUBA: CASTRO TO VISIT U.S. -- Fidel Castro plans to travel to the United States for the first time since 1995 to attend summit talks next week at the United Nations. Cuba has requested visas for Mr. Castro and other top officials and has already discussed preliminary security arrangements with the United States Secret Service and the New York Police Department, the Foreign Ministry said. The meeting, which begins Wednesday, will bring together more than 150 world leaders.</p>

        <p>CANADA: VIETNAM RETURNS BODY -- Vietnam has handed over to a Canadian family the body of a woman who was executed in April for drug smuggling. The body of Nguyen Thi Hiep, a Canadian citizen, was missing an ear, family members said. Her mother was also released as part of a general amnesty. Both women were convicted in a trial in Hanoi that Canadian lawyers say ignored evidence that they were being used as unwitting couriers.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: DE KLERK'S WARNING -- Whites have a special responsibility to deal with racism in South Africa, but affluent blacks also have a duty to combat discrimination, former President F. W. de Klerk said. Mr. de Klerk, who repudiated apartheid in 1990 and shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Nelson Mandela, said in an interview in London that racism threatened to undermine political stability in South Africa and could lead to a backlash by Afrikaners if left unchecked.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: REBELS ASK U.S. FOR RANSOM -- A Muslim rebel spokesman demanded a $10 million ransom for Jeffrey Schilling, 24, an American kidnapped a week ago on a remote southern island. In a conversation with a government negotiator broadcast on a local radio station, the spokesman, Abu Sabaya, also asked for food and medicine to be sent for Mr. Schilling, who American officials say has serious health problems. American officials have ruled out paying a ransom.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: PRESIDENT PRESSES FOR TRIAL -- President Abdurrahman Wahid said the corruption trail of former President Suharto must proceed even though the former leader failed to attend its opening, citing ill health. But Mr. Wahid repeated his promise to pardon Mr. Suharto, 79, once the trial is completed, ''on condition he returns all of the wealth he illegally collected during his presidency.''</p>

        <p>EAST TIMOR: 19 NAMED IN VIOLENCE -- Indonesian state prosecutors named 19 civilians and military officers as suspects in the killings, kidnappings and destruction that ravaged East Timor last year. The list excluded several prominent names, most notably the former military commander, General Wiranto, who was implicated by an earlier fact-finding commission.</p>

        <p>NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA: ACCORD ON MILITARY TALKS -- After extending talks in Pyongyang for a fourth day, North and South Korea agreed to ease tensions on the divided peninsula by opening a dialogue among military officials, according to a statement released in Seoul. With the talks under threat of ending without a significant agreement, South Korea's unification minister, Pak Chae Kyu, traveled by train to a remote province of North Korea to meet its leader, Kim Jong Il, a move considered pivotal in reaching an accord.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: ACCUSATION DENIED -- The opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe denied accusations made by President Chandrika Kumaratunga that he knew in advance about a suicide bomb attack on her last December by Tamil rebels. Mr. Wickremesinghe said the president was trying to smear him in advance of Oct. 10 elections. ''I deny this false allegation completely,'' he said in a letter to Mrs. Kumaratunga.</p>
