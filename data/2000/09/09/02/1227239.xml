        <p>Kevin O'Neill, a college head coach for the past 11 years, has been hired by the Knicks to replace Brendan Malone as an assistant coach on Jeff Van Gundy's staff, General Manager Scott Layden announced yesterday. Malone resigned last month to join the Indiana Pacers' coaching staff. O'Neill, 43, spent the last three years at Northwestern, where he led the Wildcats to a 30-56 record. He has also been the head coach at Tennessee and Marquette. His career record is 190-197.</p>
        <p>''I look forward to the challenge of the N.B.A.,'' said O'Neill, a native of Chateaugay, N.Y. ''I'm very excited to be with one of the premier organizations in the league and to work with one of the premier coaching staffs, especially Jeff Van Gundy.''</p>
