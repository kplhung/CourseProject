        <p>Arson investigators continued rummaging today through the rubble of a sprawling, unfinished apartment complex ravaged by a fast-spreading fire Wednesday night, trying to determine whether the blaze was an accident or intentionally set.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing definitive yet,'' Joseph Green, a spokesman for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said late this afternoon. The agency routinely dispatches its fire investigators to the sites of major blazes that cause more than $1 million in damage and significantly disrupt a town, Mr. Green said. Two of the bureau's investigators are working with members of the Bergen County prosecutor's office.</p>
        <p>The fire destroyed 240 apartments under construction in the $70 million complex, known as Avalon River Mews, and nine one- and two-family homes across Undercliff Avenue on the project's western edge. Several other houses and a two-story apartment building were damaged by the intense heat.</p>
        <p>Dozens of residents were left homeless. Barbara Rae, the borough  clerk in Edgewater, said 59 people had registered for emergency housing with the Red Cross through this morning and several others signed up for assistance this afternoon. Other homeless residents of Undercliff Avenue have taken refuge with families or friends.</p>
        <p>Those who registered with the Red Cross are staying at two motels in the Edgewater area, Ms. Rae said. Costs are being shared by the Red Cross and the owner of the Avalon River Mews complex, AvalonBay Communities of Princeton, she said.</p>
        <p>The arson investigators focused their attention this afternoon on debris in the complex's southwestern corner. Residents of Russell Avenue, on the northern border of the development, said Wednesday night that they saw the fire begin there about 8 p.m. and spread rapidly northward. They said the flames consumed the entire complex in about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>The Bergen County executive, William P. Schuber, said Thursday that officials considered the fire suspicious because it moved so rapidly through a site that few people, except workers, had access to. The apartments in the complex were unoccupied.</p>
        <p>But William M. Connolly, director of New Jersey's Division of Codes and Standards, which oversees the state's uniform building code, said he believed that the fire spread so quickly because only 60 of the project's 240 apartments had fire-retardant wallboard covering their interior walls, as is required by the state code. In the 180 others, only the wood frames of interior walls had been erected. Because of all the exposed framework, oxygen, vital to the fire's growth, flowed in unimpeded, Mr. Connolly said.</p>
        <p>''The fire struck while the building was at a very vulnerable stage,'' he said. ''Of necessity in construction, there has to be a brief period when all this stuff is exposed, and that's when the fire hit.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Green, of the A.T.F., said the arson investigators were trying to  pinpoint the spot where the fire started. If they find it, he said, they will look for signs of accidental causes, like electrical malfunctions. If the investigators rule out an accidental cause, they will search for arson clues using dogs trained to detect the odors of gasoline and other accelerants.</p>
