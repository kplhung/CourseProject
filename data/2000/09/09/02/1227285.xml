        <p>With many new democracies and some old ones under strain because of economic setbacks, rebellions and unsatisfactory political leadership, lawmakers from around the world have spent the last three days urging one another to make legislative bodies at every level of government stronger institutions.</p>
        <p>The lawmakers were part of the first ''summit'' meeting of more than 150 presiding officers of the world's legislatures, an event that leaders of the United States Congress chose not to attend.

        <p>With many new democracies and some old ones under strain because of economic setbacks, rebellions and unsatisfactory political leadership, lawmakers from around the world have spent the last three days urging one another to make legislative bodies at every level of government stronger institutions.</p>
        <p>The lawmakers were part of the first ''summit'' meeting of more than 150 presiding officers of the world's legislatures, an event that leaders of the United States Congress chose not to attend. Throughout the conference, the speakers, who for the most part were elected by grass-roots constituencies, repeatedly addressed the question of how to give their voters a more direct sense of involvement in national policymaking.</p>
        <p>Speakers of both lower and upper houses of parliament at the conference, organized by the Geneva-based Inter-Parliamentary Union, said that in an era of globalization, ordinary people often seemed to feel that political and economic power was moving farther away from them, even in established democracies.</p>
        <p>''If there is one broad, general trend discernible at this critical juncture of world history,'' said Bichai Rattakul, speaker of the Thailand House of Representatives, ''it must surely be the awakening of the people, the common man, from rich and poor nations alike, who are now clamoring and positioning themselves to have more say in the determination of their livelihoods and well being, and demanding more transparency in the execution of the affairs of state.''</p>
        <p>Sir Ramesh Jeewoolall, speaker of the National Assembly of Mauritius, took the argument a step further. ''Let us remind ourselves,'' he told his fellow legislative leaders, ''democracy carries with it the idea of free debate of issues, as well as free choice of a legislative body, which has the sole power to legislate on behalf of the people.''</p>
        <p>But he also cautioned against allowing legislatures to become too parochial.</p>
        <p>Worldwide, democratically elected legislatures share some growing problems, some speakers said. G. M. C. Balayogi, speaker of the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian Parliament, catalogued the concerns as ''the growth of the executive, disproportionate to the oversight functions of parliaments; the growing influence of power-brokering groups and lobbies; the nexus in some societies between politics, bureaucracy, business and crimes; and the declining probity and standards in public life.''</p>
        <p>The point was brought home by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of the Cambodian National Assembly, who clings to his political space through his legislative title against a strong central government that has tried to crush most political opponents. In his speech, Prince Ranariddh pleaded for stronger support from a range of civic organizations and the media.</p>
        <p>Working together, parliaments could play a larger part in correcting political abuses, said Luciano Violante, president of the Chamber of Deputies in Italy.</p>
        <p>''Parliaments should champion respect for and implementation of the U.N. conventions on international humanitarian law,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''I think the time is right,'' Mr. Violante said, ''for a concise charter of the duties of states, which could initially represent a purely moral restraint against inhumane treatment and for the protection of all minorities, against corruption and for assigning a reasonable share of public resources to the eradication of poverty, and for education and health care.''</p>
        <p>In an age of special interests, said Raymond Forni, speaker of the National Assembly of France, the role of promoting citizens' causes should not be left to nongovernmental organizations, however welcome a phenomenon they are in most places.</p>
        <p>Although the United States is a founding member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, it has not paid its dues since 1996. The United States was criticized not only for its absence, but also because Washington had denied visas to two national speakers, from Cuba and Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>That decision, a statement from the union president, Dr. Najma Heptulla of India's upper house, said, ''is all the more regrettable in that it has occurred on the occasion of this historic parliamentary summit.''</p>
