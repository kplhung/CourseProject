        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>Q. So what main themes do you hit now?</p>
        <p>A. ''A couple of things. One, here's what I want to do. Here's my agenda. It's an agenda that you've heard before, perhaps others haven't. I'm going to discuss it again. Military preparedness. Health care -- I'll be talking about it next week. Social Security agenda . . .</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from an interview with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>Q. So what main themes do you hit now?</p>
        <p>A. ''A couple of things. One, here's what I want to do. Here's my agenda. It's an agenda that you've heard before, perhaps others haven't. I'm going to discuss it again. Military preparedness. Health care -- I'll be talking about it next week. Social Security agenda . . .</p>
        <p>''I'm going to say -- and I'm going to continue talking about -- missed opportunities by this administration. I find it amazing, and I think America will, too, that some of the same campaign issues they ran on in '92 are issues they run on in the year 2000: a middle-class tax cut. That was the cornerstone of their fiscal policy in '92; they said, vote for us, we'll give you a middle-class tax cut. Al Gore is saying, vote for me, I'll give you a targeted middle-class tax cut. Prescription drugs and Medicare. Social Security reform. These are issues that still exist; my opponent has to campaign on them because they haven't been solved.'' . . .</p>
        <p>On Campaign Ads</p>
        <p>Q. How does the new R.N.C. ad fit in with a changed tone?</p>
        <p>A. This is politics. The idea of working with John Breaux and Bob Kerrey and concerned Democrats about doing what's right for Medicare is, in my judgment, a different issue. It's a tongue-in-cheek ad. It is a way to defend, for Republicans to defend me, against $30 million of negative advertising or whatever you want to call it.</p>
        <p>Q. Those ads stuck to your record and issues, though.</p>
        <p>A. But there are some interesting implications to it. If this is what's going to happen in the campaign, we've got to lay the groundwork: this is a fellow that will say anything. They went after my education record. Objective people have said the education record in Texas is superlative. The point is, this is a way to help inoculate me about what has come and is coming.</p>
        <p>Q. So it's a defense against specific claims of a guy who you say will distort?</p>
        <p>A. Exactly.</p>
        <p>Q. But what about your campaign's promise to ''change the tone''? Won't this potentially alienate the very nonpartisans, women, swing voters you need?</p>
        <p>A. If they do, then -- I read where someone said this is going to cost me the election, this ad. Let's let the public judge. The public will judge.'' . . .</p>
        <p>On the Closeness of the Race</p>
        <p>Q. You've said this will be close. As close as Nixon and Kennedy race in 1960?</p>
        <p>A. I don't know. It's hard to tell right now. But I think it's going to be a close race. And if you had asked me a year ago: ''The economy's strong, we're at peace, you're running against an incumbent,'' basically running against an incumbent, willing to wear the mantle, except in times where it didn't go so well, and you say, ''You're even with 60 days to go or however many, 65 days to go, would you take it?'' Yes.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you defeat a guy like this? How do you convince voters to change administrations during good times?</p>
        <p>A. Because they realize there are failed opportunities. Failed opportunities. They have not led. We will.</p>
        <p>Q. You've said you sometimes get tired, and these next weeks are going to be exhausting. So how do you get through them without slips, bloopers and the like?</p>
        <p>A. I'm going to concentrate and focus. But I'm in good physical condition. I'm upbeat. And part of how I, what I do on the stump is how I feel, and I feel good. Obviously, this is a long, long pull. It's been an interesting experience. It's going to be really fascinating coming down the stretch . . . It's been a great journey. I'm going to look back on these days. It's an amazing experience. I understand what's coming up, but I've been in tough races before. '94. I understand the pressures. And, you know, I've got great faith in the American voter. I do. I've got faith in the voters. They are going to discern. They are going to make a judgment call as to who best to lead this country, and that includes changing the tone in Washington, that includes setting the right goals for the country, that includes watching us all, watching both of us, as we head toward the finish line. And I trust the judgment of the people. I don't necessarily like their judgment at times. I didn't like it in '92, obviously. But I trust them. And it's like on this ad, I told you, there's a filter and that's your job, that's your purpose, but the American people will judge whether this is harsh or not. I trust the people's judgment. I do.</p>
        <p>Q. And if they judge for Gore?</p>
        <p>A. Seriously, I would respect that. I'm not going to like it. But this is democracy. I love the system and I love the country. I love what America stands for. I don't want to sound Pollyanna-ish about it, but I do. This is an important country and an important process. And it's long and it's exciting and you've got to grip all of that, hours on the plane, policy, it is an important part, an important part of what this country's about. I am so honored to be one of two coming down the stretch. I am. And I think Americans can see my enthusiasm for what this country stands for.</p>
        <p>Q. Why are you getting teary?</p>
        <p>A. I'm not teary. I'm tired.</p>
        <p>On the Debates</p>
        <p>Q. How important are debates? Sway undecideds?</p>
        <p>A. I think they're a very important part of the process.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you think they'll sway a lot of votes?</p>
        <p>A. I think they'll confirm votes.</p>
        <p>Q. Undecided people will watch and decide?</p>
        <p>A. They may. Listen, ask the debate experts. I view debates as part of the process.</p>
        <p>Q. Why not just end the debate over debates?</p>
        <p>A. Because I think there may be some better formats. I want to explore all options.</p>
        <p>Q. Better how?</p>
        <p>A. It's hard for me to say until I hear what all the different options are . . .</p>
        <p>On Military Preparedness</p>
        <p>Q. You and Cheney have been making an issue of military preparedness. If you become president, would you pull troops immediately out of Kosovo and Bosnia?</p>
        <p>A. No, I wouldn't. I've said that publicly. I would not. Because I understand the commitment to which we'll be bound, but I will work with our allies to lay the groundwork to begin to take up more of the peacekeeping role in Bosnia and Kosovo. The model that I thought made a lot of sense was the East Timor model where the United States provided needed logistical support to, in this case, Australian troops, to help keep the peace. We need to review all the missions. I think Haiti was a failure -- $2 billion. And our point is that the mission needs to be focused and Clinton, the Gore campaign, is trying to say we're the strongest military in the world. Yeah. That's not the question. I think people recognize that. The question is, will we be the strongest in the world to the point where we can keep the peace. I look forward to this debate. I'm going to continue bringing up the issue. It is a real issue. It is an important issue. And it's not only what the military looks like today, it's what the military will look like tomorrow.</p>
        <p>This is a good opportunity for us to refashion the military. It'll help bring some fiscal sanity to the defense budget if we have a strategic plan that redefines, begins to define, what the military will look like in the long term. There are some very difficult decisions that have to be made about aircraft and the missions and how we move combat troops. Those decisions would better be made, best be made, in the context of a larger strategic plan, and one of the first things I'm going to do is work with the Secretary of Defense, military planners, to develop a cohesive long-term strategy as to where to spend research and development money. This is an important issue for me. . . .</p>
