        <p>Orlando Hernandez induced Cristian Guzman's grounder to Tino Martinez in the first inning, but he started late in covering first base and then stopped running when the ball got to Martinez. But Martinez bobbled the ball, and Hernandez was out of position, about 30 feet from the base. Guzman was safe. Hernandez bowed his head and tapped his hand against his chest, as if to say, ''My bad.''</p>
        <p>It was the last time that El Duque had to admonish himself last night. It was almost the last time that the Minnesota Twins had anything that resembled a scoring threat against Hernandez, who pitched superbly again in guiding the Yankees to a 4-2 victory at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Yankees began a draining period in which they have 31 straight games without a day off, and one player who needs to show them that he can still be a significant contributor in the postseason is El Duque.</p>
        <p>Slowly, Hernandez is doing that. He won his third consecutive start by tossing eight strong innings in which he gave up two runs and five hits.</p>
        <p>''The important thing to me is the game that he threw tonight,'' Paul O'Neill said. ''Everybody knows that he can do it going down the stretch and into the playoffs. That's the guy you want out there. He's done it before.''</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre explained that he could see the gradual improvement in Hernandez as he got ''a little sharper'' in each start and raved, ''That's vintage stuff.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill ripped a two-run homer in the first inning and Martinez and Bernie Williams also socked homers off Brad Radke, a pitcher who did not endear himself to the Yankees with comments he made in July. After the Yankees battered Radke and beat the Twins, 9-5, on July 28, he rationalized the defeat by saying: ''They have a $150 million payroll. They should win every game.''</p>
        <p>Not only was Radke wrong by about $40 million, he also offended several Yankees. The Yankees took it personally that Radke was basing their incredible success strictly on payroll. Obviously, the Yankees have been superb, in part, because of George Steinbrenner's willingness to spend. But the players also know there is more to winning than who has the fattest payroll. The Baltimore Orioles are a perennial example of spending and not succeeding.</p>
        <p>This has been a trying season for Hernandez, who went more than five weeks without a victory in July and August because of ineffectiveness and injuries. Hernandez irritated the Yankees when he was activated by saying that a member of the Yankees' coaching staff had said that he was not ''as hurt as much as I thought.'' Hernandez later apologized.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees do not care about what Hernandez said previously or how he pitched previously. The Yankees do need him to pitch reliably for the last month of the season so they can again depend on him in October.</p>
        <p>Hernandez is 5-0 with a 1.02 earned run average in the last two postseasons and he is finally giving the Yankees reasons to believe that he might do that again. He struck out six, did not walk a batter and pitched his best game since topping the Mets, 2-1, on July 7.</p>
        <p>''I think he feels better and when you feel better you tend to challenge people a little bit more,'' Torre said. ''I think he was prouder of his stuff. Tonight, I thought he was back to where we want him.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez offered brief responses to reporters and would not even say if he is 100 percent healthy and concluded: ''I feel comfortable. I feel good. I hope to help the team achieve our goals.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill ran sprints in foul territory yesterday while the Yankees started batting practice and still felt pain in the hip pointer that has bothered him for more than a week. O'Neill is a hitter, not a sprinter. So, as O'Neill sprinted, he never let go of his 35-ounce bat.</p>
        <p>The first chance to use it came in the first and O'Neill did not waste it as he blasted Radke's 1-1 fastball over the left-field fence to make it 2-0. O'Neill swung, dropped his head like he always does, peeked out to left and looked away again.</p>
        <p>''I was surprised it went out,'' said O'Neill, who is still slowed by the hip and played only seven innings.</p>
        <p>David Ortiz's bloop double in the fifth ended Hernandez's streak of retiring 10 in a row and he later scored on Jacque Jones's booming double. Ortiz's homer produced another run in the seventh, but Hernandez pumped a fastball by Jones to preserve the 4-2 edge.</p>
        <p>Hernandez trudged off the mound each inning like a man who was carrying two kegs on his back. His shoulders slumped, his eyes focused on the grass and his feet taking one small step at a time, he was not in a rush. Maybe Hernandez was conserving energy, which the Yankees should appreciate. This is going to be a long month and he must be rested and ready for the Yankees to be totally ready for the postseason.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>In addition to activating CHUCK KNOBLAUCH and RAMIRO MENDOZA, the Yankees also recalled outfielder RYAN THOMPSON and reliever CRAIG DINGMAN from Class AAA Columbus. General Manager BRIAN CASHMAN said reliever JAY TESSMER would probably be promoted today while infielder ALFONSO SORIANO and pitchers DARRELL EINERTSON and RANDY KEISLER are expected to be summoned next week. The rescheduled Old-Timers' Day is today, with DON MATTINGLY coming back to Yankee Stadium for the game for the first time since he retired.</p>
