        <p>In the end, Billy Traber decided, he just wanted to play baseball. If he turns out to be a No. 3 starter in the majors, as the Mets believe, he will recoup the substantial difference between what he thought he would receive as a first-round draft choice and what he signed for today.</p>
        <p>Traber, a left-hander from Loyola Marymount University, signed with the Mets for about $400,000, roughly $1.3 million less than what the Mets were willing to pay before a routine M.R.I. test revealed potential problems with his pitching elbow.</p>

        <p>The decision to sign was difficult for the 20-year-old Traber, who was chosen with the 16th overall pick in the June draft. He could have started classes for his senior year this week, but that would have essentially ended negotiations with the Mets and delayed the start of his professional career. And with the revelation that he could one day tear an elbow ligament and require the same type of ligament replacement surgery that Tommy John made famous -- which usually requires a year of recovery time -- Traber probably had no chance to improve his negotiating position.</p>
