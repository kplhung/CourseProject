        <p>The Mets do not have a stolen base sign. Most players steal on their own, sometimes with input from the Mets' career stolen base leader, the first base coach Mookie Wilson. This can apply to all the Mets, including the speedy rookie Timoniel Perez, who made a very costly decision tonight in his first major league game.</p>
        <p>Perez, who played in Japan last year and was not expected to rise above Class AA this season, slapped a two-out single in the ninth inning at Busch Stadium. Edgardo Alfonzo was batting and Mike Piazza was on deck in a 5-5 game, but the Cardinals' bullpen was stifling the Mets.</p>

        <p>The Mets do not have a stolen base sign. Most players steal on their own, sometimes with input from the Mets' career stolen base leader, the first base coach Mookie Wilson. This can apply to all the Mets, including the speedy rookie Timoniel Perez, who made a very costly decision tonight in his first major league game.</p>
        <p>Perez, who played in Japan last year and was not expected to rise above Class AA this season, slapped a two-out single in the ninth inning at Busch Stadium. Edgardo Alfonzo was batting and Mike Piazza was on deck in a 5-5 game, but the Cardinals' bullpen was stifling the Mets.</p>
        <p>''We have a don't-go sign, and that wasn't a don't-go situation,'' Wilson said.</p>
        <p>So Perez went. And Cardinals catcher Mike Matheny threw him out to end the inning. That was the Mets' last chance: with the left-hander John Franco out because a sore pectoral muscle, Pat Mahomes pitched the ninth and gave up a one-out home run to Jim Edmonds that gave the Cardinals a 6-5 victory, their first in seven games with the Mets this year.</p>
        <p>Because the Atlanta Braves also lost, the Mets held on to their half-game lead in the National League East.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine seemed to blame himself for Perez's daring on the basepaths. ''I don't like to see that out made with Fonzie and Mike'' coming up, Valentine said. ''But I didn't hold him.''</p>
        <p>Through an interpreter, Perez said he regretted his decision: ''Thinking about it, yeah, I wouldn't do it. The No. 3 hitter could hit a double or a home run. In another situation, it would be different.''</p>
        <p>Mahomes (4-3) believed this game would be different for him. The right-hander had a dreadful August, and he spent Thursday's off-day at home in Tyler, Tex., trying ''to get all the bad thoughts out.'' His mind was clear and he had renewed confidence in his fastball, deciding to stay with a pitch he had abandoned.</p>
        <p>In the ninth, he retired J. D. Drew on groundout off a cut fastball. Then, Mahomes got ahead of Edmonds with two fastballs, and he thought he could beat Edmonds with the pitch. Instead, it became Edmonds's 37th home run.</p>
        <p>''I tried to make the pitch I wanted to make, up at his chest, inside and high -- he got it,'' said Mahomes, who has been scored on in each of his last nine games. ''I may think about it a little bit tonight, but when I come to the park tomorrow, it'll be what it is -- in the past.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had lost the lead in the seventh, when Edmonds singled in a run off Dennis Cook to tie it, 5-5. They had gotten the lead two innings earlier, when Matt Franco, who was outrighted to Class AAA Norfolk in mid-August, delivered in his first plate appearance since returning today.</p>
        <p>After Robin Ventura led off the sixth with a home run that tied the game, 4-4, Franco pinch-hit for starter Bobby J. Jones with one out and runners at second and third. He lined Mike James's pitch the opposite way, and left fielder Ray Lankford leaped for a twisting catch. But the sacrifice fly scored Jay Payton to put the Mets ahead, 5-4.</p>
        <p>Franco stayed in the game at first base when Rick White relieved Jones, who allowed four runs on seven hits and a walk. He also allowed a pair of stolen bases as the Cardinals showed off a new strategy.</p>
        <p>St. Louis attempted no steals in three games against the Mets in July. But the first three Cardinals to reach base all ran on Jones and Piazza, the catcher, and all three reached base before the throw.</p>
        <p>Lankford, however, overslid second base in the second and was tagged out for the second out of the inning. But Edgar Renteria walked and promptly reclaimed second with a steal. One batter later, Mike Matheny doubled him in to make it 1-0.</p>
        <p>The lead did not last long, partly because Jones improbably sustained a rally. The pitcher, who hit .313 last year came into the game 0 for 33 this year, bounced a curveball up the middle for a single, moving Darryl Hamilton to third.</p>
        <p>After another out, Lenny Harris chopped a ball halfway up the third base line. Craig Paquette fielded it, and his throw seemed to beat Harris to first. But Harris was safe, the run scored and the Mets had tied it, 1-1.</p>
        <p>They took a 3-1 lead the next inning, when Jay Payton lined a fastball into the left-center field bleachers for a two-run home run. The Cardinals got a run back in the fifth on a one-out single by Fernando Vina, then went ahead, 4-3, when J.D. Drew powered Jones' first pitch 416 feet to right for a two-run homer.</p>
        <p>Jones did not watch its flight, descending the mound with his head down as soon as Drew connected.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Right fielder DEREK BELL had a magnetic resonance imaging test on his strained right hip Friday, and BOBBY VALENTINE said the results were good. Bell, who also has a bruise of his left knee, could play by Sunday. . . . Starter AL LEITER (strained backside) will throw in the bullpen Saturday and said he expects to make his scheduled start Monday. Reliever JOHN FRANCO (sore pectoral muscle) threw 60 pitches in the bullpen Friday with no reported problems, but he will not be ready to pitch Saturday. . . . The Mets promoted infielders MATT FRANCO and JORGE TOCA, catcher VANCE WILSON and pitchers ERIC CAMMACK and RICH RODRIGUEZ from Class AAA Norfolk on Friday. . . . Cardinals first baseman MARK MCGWIRE, who has not played since July 6 because of patella tendinitis in his left knee, took early batting practice for 30 minutes, an encouraging sign to Manager TONY LA RUSSA, who thinks there is a chance McGwire could return this year as a pinch-hitter.</p>
