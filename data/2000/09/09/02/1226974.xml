        <p>KAPLAN-Judith. On Septe mber 6, 2000 of lung cancer. Survived by mother Rose W. Kaplan, brother Robert, three cousins and a legion of devoted friends in the West Village. A memorial service will be announced. Donations in her memory to The American Cancer Society Manhattan/Bronx Office, 19 West 56 St., NY, NY 10019-3984.</p>
        <p>KAPLAN-Judy. A S immons College graduate and politically active resident of Greenwich Village for 37 years, passed away September 6 at St. Vincent's Hospital. Although born in Philadelphia, it was on Barrow Street that Ms. Kaplan shared her life with Robert Ziegler, an unusually eclectic group of friends, and her ever-present cats. Mr. Ziegler died suddenly on September 2nd. Ms. Kaplan was a tireless activist for both popular and unpopular causes, lending her name, time and energy to a wide variety of issues. Her presence will be sorely missed, not only at sit-ins, rent strikes, marches for justice in Central America, and demonstrations for Mumia, but also at Village jazz clubs (especially if there was an old-time bebop artist), the theatre (off-off Broadway a favorite), the library (a more frequent borrower would be hard to imagine), and Coney Island. Somehow she also found time to travel extensively. Judy touched everyone and leaves a legacy of friendship to all who knew her. Ms. Kaplan is survived by her mother and brother, residents of Philadelphia. A memorial will be announced.</p>
