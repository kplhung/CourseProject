        <p>''The growing and dangerous intrusion of this new technology,'' Jack Valenti said, threatens an entire industry's ''economic vitality and future security.'' Mr. Valenti, the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, and he was ready for a rhetorical rumble. The new technology, he said, ''is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston Strangler is to the woman alone.''</p>
        <p>It was 1982, and he was talking about videocassette recorders.</p>
        <p>But the woman in this instance survived, and even flourished. ''It is fair to say,'' declared Charles S. Sims, a lawyer at Proskauer Rose who represents the industry in Internet-related litigations, ''that as things worked out, the studios did not lose control of their products'' through home taping on VCR's. Indeed, video rental income now rivals box-office receipts.</p>
        <p>Still, adaptation was not the industry's first response to the new technology. Its first response was to sue.</p>
        <p>Some hear an echo of Mr. Valenti's doom-saying in the entertainment industry's recent lawsuits against Web sites that allow users to swap music and movies and to decrypt DVD's. In July, Marilyn H. Patel, a federal judge in San Francisco, effectively signed a death warrant for Napster, a Web site through which users share music files. Asserting that it had ''contributed to illegal copying on a scale that is without precedent,'' she said: ''Any destruction of Napster Inc. by a preliminary injunction is speculative compared to the statistical evidence of massive, unauthorized downloading and uploading of plaintiffs' copyrighted works -- as many as 10,000 files per second, by defendant's own admission.''</p>
        <p>An appellate court deferred the enforcement of that order until it hears arguments.</p>
        <p>Last month Lewis A. Kaplan, a federal judge in New York, forbade Eric Corley, a computer hacker, and his company, which publishes a magazine and maintains a Web site, to post or even provide hyperlinks to sites containing a computer code for decrypting DVD's. Judge Kaplan was unmoved by the general availability of the code on countless Web sites. ''If a plaintiff seeks to enjoin a defendant from burning a pasture,'' he wrote, ''it is no answer that there is a wild fire burning in its direction.''</p>
        <p>Nor was he impressed by the defendants' First Amendment arguments: ''The Constitution, after all, is a framework for building a just and democratic society. It is not a suicide pact.'' He was echoing a similar statement by Justice Robert H. Jackson in a 1949 Supreme Court decision.</p>
        <p>Unlike Judges Patel and Kaplan, however, jurists have generally been reluctant to wade into fast-evolving technical issues. Existing law can fit poorly with technological developments, mostly because the legislators who drafted the laws did not anticipate them.</p>
        <p>The VCR case, for instance, caused the Supreme Court considerable anguish. The court heard arguments twice, and finally, a year and a half after it had agreed to decide the case, it issued a 5-to-4 decision allowing home taping. The court's uneasiness with the technical aspects of the case was evident in its description of the device under attack. ''The pause button, when depressed,'' Justice John Paul Stevens solemnly found, ''deactivates the recorder until it is released.''</p>
        <p>The only point on which the justices on both sides agreed was that the courts were the wrong forum for regulating technological advances. ''Like so many problems created by the interaction of copyright law with a new technology,'' Justice Harry Blackmun said in dissent, ''there can be no really satisfactory solution to the problem here, until Congress acts.''</p>
        <p>Legal experts have no trouble thinking of similar examples from the past. Susan P. Crawford, who specializes in Internet issues at Wilmer, Cutler &amp; Pickering in Washington, noted the sheet music industry's challenge to the new player piano technology in 1908. The Supreme Court of that era held that perforated paper was not a copy of musical notations for purposes of the copyright law.</p>
        <p>While the court observed that the case was ''of very considerable importance'' because it involved ''large property interests'' and ''the rights of composers and music publishers,'' it held that existing law did not prohibit the new technology. As in the VCR case, the court said the issue was for Congress to decide.</p>
        <p>Ms. Crawford went on to identify what seems to be a recurring theme in the litigation in this area: ''The older industry lost.''</p>
        <p>Legal scholars are sharply divided on whether litigation is the appropriate vehicle for resolving these clashes. Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that judicial resolution of cases like the one against Napster ''is what law is all about.'' He said that ''it is a good and acceptable thing if business people address the violation of their legal rights by seeking judicial relief.''</p>
        <p>He dismissed concerns that Napster or at least its decentralized cousin Gnutella is unstoppable as a practical matter. ''It's important not to take a nirvana-or-the-abyss attitude about these things,'' he said. ''Any attempt to enforce the law is going to be imperfect.''</p>
        <p>Others are warier of judicial intervention. ''This is a technology that is enormously exciting, with enormous potential,'' said David G. Post, a law professor at Temple University, referring not only to Napster but to all file sharing. ''It has the potential to fundamentally alter people's relation to information on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>The legal system, he continued, should ''allow this thing to grow and move off into all those new applications and somehow figure out how to compensate those who are harmed.''</p>
        <p>Lawrence Lessig, a law professor at Stanford and the author of ''Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace,'' also questioned the wisdom of a rush to judicial judgment. He told Judge Patel in a report filed at Napster's request that the record companies' ''apparent aim is to use the law to fit the Internet into their traditional business model.'' Mr. Lessig urged the court to act cautiously before attempting ''judicial regulation on net architecture.''</p>
        <p>There are other problems as well. Napster, like the VCR manufacturers before it, is accused of ''contributory infringement,'' a concept invented by judges as a sort of short cut. It allows a single suit against a central facilitator rather than thousands of suits against individual infringers.</p>
        <p>''It's almost like a class action,'' Mr. Post said. And as in class actions, he went on, courts should be concerned about the interests of those not before the court. In the Napster case these absent voices include people who merely retrieve from remote locations music they already own, musicians who welcome the opportunity to distribute their work and even copyright holders who think that sampling will encourage buying.</p>
        <p>''The other thing about litigation is that the future is not present either,'' he said. ''The courts are inherently retrospective institutions.''</p>
        <p>If nothing else, he continued, this much is clear about the future: ''The people who will make money are not those saying, 'You're infringing my technology.' The people making money here are those thinking, 'This is a really neat idea.' ''</p>
