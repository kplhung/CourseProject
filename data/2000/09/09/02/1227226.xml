        <p>Dudley Clendinen, in Editorial Observer column, holds that in Florida, where 25 percent of state's population is expected to be over 65 by year 2010, there is 'crisis' in providing long-term care for aged (M)c</p>

        <p>In Florida, where retirees have been flocking since the 1920's and where 25 percent of the state's population is expected to be over 65 by the year 2010, there are growing feelings of strain and exhaustion among the managers, the nurses and nurses' aides who care for the old and frail. The word most often heard in conversations with elder-care professionals these days is ''crisis.'' With a population calculated to be aging at a rate 20 years ahead of the nation as a whole, the Sunshine State has become a harbinger for a nation growing old and facing problems with long-term care for the aged.</p>
        <p>As the average life span lengthens, people seem healthier in old age than ever before. The question is how to serve those who become infirm or ill. In Florida and in the nation, most of that burden falls, as it always has, on families, usually on a woman caring for an older one. In Florida, a study four years ago found that almost 80 percent of the frail elderly were cared for at home. African-American and Hispanic families are more likely to care for their own, says Larry Polivka, director of the Center on Aging at the University of South Florida, whereas more whites seek professional help. But there is no way to know what quality of care the people at home actually get, or what sacrifices their care-givers have to make to give it.</p>

        <p>In Florida, where retirees have been flocking since the 1920's and where 25 percent of the state's population is expected to be over 65 by the year 2010, there are growing feelings of strain and exhaustion among the managers, the nurses and nurses' aides who care for the old and frail. The word most often heard in conversations with elder-care professionals these days is ''crisis.'' With a population calculated to be aging at a rate 20 years ahead of the nation as a whole, the Sunshine State has become a harbinger for a nation growing old and facing problems with long-term care for the aged.</p>
        <p>As the average life span lengthens, people seem healthier in old age than ever before. The question is how to serve those who become infirm or ill. In Florida and in the nation, most of that burden falls, as it always has, on families, usually on a woman caring for an older one. In Florida, a study four years ago found that almost 80 percent of the frail elderly were cared for at home. African-American and Hispanic families are more likely to care for their own, says Larry Polivka, director of the Center on Aging at the University of South Florida, whereas more whites seek professional help. But there is no way to know what quality of care the people at home actually get, or what sacrifices their care-givers have to make to give it.</p>
        <p>What is known, Professor Polivka says, is that more than 88 percent of the public money spent to support long-term care in Florida now goes to nursing homes, where the remaining 20 percent of the frail elderly reside. Nationally, in the last fiscal year about $39 billion in public money for long-term care went to nursing homes, where the average age of the residents is 85, where 42 percent are demented, and 72 percent are women.</p>
        <p>Virtually no one seems happy about the current state of affairs. The federal government has found substantial evidence of fraud and mismanagement in nursing home chains, as well as consistent patterns of neglect and abuse. The nursing homes feel over-regulated, under-compensated, unable to hire and keep employees, and over-sued. The nursing home employees, who are called on to do difficult work with compassion, feel underpaid and unfairly maligned. The families of the residents increasingly sue on charges of mistreatment. And a growing body of consumer advocates accuse the state and federal governments of having no sensible policy of long-term care.</p>
        <p>It is, in a word, a mess.</p>
        <p>Although four-fifths of Florida's nursing homes are in business to make a profit, and tax dollars pay for 90 percent of their charges, 23 percent of the beds are now managed by companies gone bankrupt. In 11 other states, the percentage is even higher.</p>
        <p>But Florida, which allows residents to sue for violation of their patient rights under state law -- and allows attorneys to collect fees separate from the damages -- leads in another national trend, the soaring rate of lawsuits against nursing homes. It began 11 years ago, when a Tampa attorney, Jim Wilkes, filed his first suit in behalf of a resident. He won. He has since expanded to seven other states, helped persuade Arkansas to pass a similar law, put up billboards on highways to solicit cases, and says he currently has 800 to 1,000 lawsuits in process, seeking a total of about $1 billion.</p>
        <p>He is out, Mr. Wilkes says, to destroy the industry. ''There are no good nursing homes,'' he says. He is wrong. There are bad ones. There are also many good and caring homes, particularly the nonprofit ones. But Mr. Wilkes and the other lawyers who have followed his lead have had an effect. A study conducted this year for the Florida Health Care Association of for-profit homes found that the annual liability cost per occupied nursing home bed has now reached $6,283 -- eight times the national average.</p>
        <p>Liability insurance premiums have ballooned. Mary Ellen Early, director of the state's group of nonprofit homes, cited two cases: a central Florida retirement community with its own nursing home, whose premium has gone in a year from $33,000 to $545,000; and a group of three homes, whose premium just jumped from $159,000 to $1.7 million. Some insurers are canceling. A dozen or more nursing homes in Florida now operate with no liability insurance at all.</p>
        <p>A 17-member task force headed by Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan, who called the situation ''frightening,'' is expected to recommend some changes to the state legislature by the end of this year. As Ruben King-Shaw, head of the state Health Care Administration, has said, ''We are witnessing the disintegration of the long-term-care system before our very eyes.''</p>
