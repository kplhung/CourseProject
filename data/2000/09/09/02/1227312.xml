        <p>President Clinton said today that he did not believe that the technology was yet ready for an effective national defense system, and passed the decision on moving ahead with the politically charged and diplomatically delicate project to his successor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton insisted that the threat of future missile attacks from states like Iraq or North Korea ''is real and growing'' and that the United States had to search for new defenses. But after two failed tests and strong resistance from Russia, China and America's closest allies in Europe, the president announced that he would not authorize even initial construction on the missile shield.</p>
        <p>''We have made progress, but we should not move forward until we have absolute confidence the system will work,'' he said, announcing one of his most important foreign policy decisions in a hastily arranged speech at Georgetown University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton laid out his case, both in politics and substance, for why it was dangerous to plunge headlong into a $60 billion program that would violate a landmark arms control treaty with Moscow. [Excerpts, Page A10.]</p>
        <p>''A national missile defense, if deployed, should be part of a larger strategy to preserve and enhance the peace, strength and security we now enjoy, and to build an even safer world,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's decision comes just before the Labor Day holiday weekend, while Congress is still in summer recess, and just days before he is to meet world leaders in New York at the United Nations. He has taken off the table an issue that might have soured his scheduled meetings with other leaders, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</p>
        <p>The decision is also likely to open up much broader debate on the issue between the presidential contenders, who have adopted starkly different approaches toward missile defenses. [Page A8.]</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential nominee, has largely embraced the administration's stand of building a limited land-based system without withdrawing from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. The Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush, favors a broader system that could include sea- and space-based arms.</p>
        <p>On May 23, Mr. Bush signaled his support for Mr. Clinton's leaving the decision to the next administration rather than committing the country to a course based on incomplete information, saying, ''No decision would be better than a flawed agreement that ties the hands of the next president and prevents America from defending itself.''</p>
        <p>But today, Mr. Bush adopted a much sharper tone, criticizing the administration's handling of the missile defense program. ''I welcome the opportunity to act where they have failed to lead by developing and deploying effective missiles to protect all 50 states and our friends and allies,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Gore said he supported Mr. Clinton's decision, which aides said he had discussed with the president, and implicitly criticized Mr. Bush's plan, which would require the United States to withdraw from the ABM Treaty. The accord bars Washington and Moscow from building national missile defenses, unless Moscow agrees to changes, which it has refused.</p>
        <p>''As president, I would oppose the kinds of missile defense systems that would unnecessarily upset strategic stability and threaten to open the gates for a renewed arms race with Russia and a new arms race with China,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, leaders throughout Europe, who had been caught between America's ambitions for missile defenses and the strong opposition from Russia and China, applauded Mr. Clinton's decision. Russian officials expressed satisfaction that their diplomatic campaign, mainly by Mr. Putin, to galvanize opposition against the American program had apparently helped persuade Mr. Clinton to abandon it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said the Pentagon would continue develop and test the system, noting that only 3 of the 19 flight tests have been conducted so far.</p>
        <p>The immediate upshot of Mr. Clinton's decision is that the Pentagon's 2005 target date for having a limited means of defending all 50 states against attack by a small number of ballistic missiles has been scrapped.</p>
        <p>Intelligence officials have warned that North Korea could have the capability to hit the United States with nuclear or chemical-tipped ballistic missiles by that date.</p>
        <p>To stick to that ambitious schedule, Mr. Clinton would have had to authorize the Pentagon by December to award contracts for initial construction on Shemya Island in Alaska of a powerful new radar that would provide the missile-tracking ability needed for an effective defense. Now those contracts will not be awarded.</p>
        <p>An independent panel led by a retired Air Force general, Larry D. Welch, determined earlier this year that because of the program's enormous technical complexity and the likelihood of technical glitches and other delays, a deployment date of 2006 or 2007 was more likely.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton seized on that analysis to assert that his decision ''will not have a significant impact on the date the overall system could be deployed in the next administration if the next president decides to go forward.''</p>
        <p>But in reality, Mr. Clinton's decision probably means that work on the Shemya radar cannot begin before 2002, which insures that a national missile defense could not be completed before 2006 at the earliest. The decision gives the next president leeway to restructure the program or reorder its priorities.</p>
        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen, the lone Republican in Mr. Clinton's cabinet, was the administration's most forceful advocate of fielding missile defenses as soon as possible. He recommended to Mr. Clinton last week and in a White House meeting on Tuesday that he go ahead with the initial construction.</p>
        <p>In a short statement, Mr. Cohen said, ''I have noted on many occasions that several emerging threats warrant the deployment of an effective missile defense program as soon as technologically feasible.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials had previously said the final decision to field a missile defense system would rest with Mr. Clinton's successor.</p>
        <p>But even the preliminary step of breaking ground and pouring a concrete foundation at the Alaska site could have been interpreted as a violation of the ABM Treaty, according to some legal analyses prepared by administration lawyers.</p>
        <p>Russia has refused to permit the United States to change the treaty, a cornerstone of cold war-era arms control policy, and Mr. Clinton was loath to have his name in the history books as the president who withdrew the United States from the accord.</p>
        <p>Fearing the diplomatic repercussions, Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, as well as Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, and her deputy, Strobe Talbott, the chief American negotiator with Russia, opposed permitting the initial construction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berger telephoned several Congressional leaders late Thursday to alert them to Mr. Clinton's decision. Ms. Albright also called several world leaders and lawmakers today, and Mr. Clinton informed President Jacques Chirac of France.</p>
        <p>In Congress Democrats, scores of whom had urged Mr. Clinton to defer all decisions on the system, applauded the move.</p>
        <p>''The president's decision gives us time to perfect our political approach to the ballistic missile threat, as well as our technology,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
        <p>Republican reaction was mixed, with some of the program's biggest backers decrying another delay. ''Because of the president's misguided decision, our children will remain completely unprotected against the weapon of choice for rogue nations and terrorist groups -- the missile,'' said Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican.</p>
        <p>Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, said, ''This is yet another example of the Clinton-Gore administration's legacy of missed opportunities.''</p>
        <p>But two prominent Republican members of the Foreign Relations Committee, Gordon H. Smith of Oregon and Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, praised Mr. Clinton's choice. ''The president made the right decision today,'' Mr. Hagel said. ''There will be dangerous consequences for America and the world if we rush to meet arbitrary decision deadlines.''</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Clinton said American security was based on the three pillars of diplomacy, deterrence and defense. ''No one suggests that N.M.D. would ever substitute for diplomacy or for deterrence,'' Mr. Clinton, using the abbreviation for national missile defense ''But such a system, if it worked properly, could give us an extra dimension of insurance in a world where proliferation has complicated the task of preserving the peace.''</p>
        <p>The president and his top advisers established four criteria to judge whether to move the system ahead: threat, cost, technology and impact on American security, including arms control agreements.</p>
        <p>''This is a balancing act that has to be taken,'' Mr. Berger told reporters after Mr. Clinton's speech. ''The way I ask the question is, will we be more secure or less secure?''</p>
        <p>Administration officials did not quarrel about the reality of the threat, even though Mr. Clinton noted that North Korea had refrained from testing new long-range missiles. And while the cost of the system's initial phase, consisting of 100 missile interceptors along with early-warning radars, had increased by about $4 billion in recent months, to a total of $25 billion, rising federal budget surpluses had eased concern about that.</p>
        <p>But the system had run into a number of technical problems. After a largely successful first test last fall, the next two tests failed, including the latest on July 7. Pentagon officials say the next test has been postponed from October or November, to next January.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton noted that crucial elements of the program, like the booster rocket for the missile interceptor, were behind schedule. Experts still had concerns whether the interceptors could adequately distinguish enemy warheads from decoys.</p>
        <p>''We simply cannot conclude, with the information that is available to us today, that we have enough confidence in the technology and operational effectiveness of this entire system to move ahead with deployment,'' Mr. Berger said.</p>
        <p>Finally, China, Russia and NATO allies voiced fears that even beginning the construction could violate the ABM Treaty and trigger a new arms race, especially in Asia.</p>
        <p>Given the potential diplomatic consequences, administration officials said, there was little reason to push ahead with even the preliminary construction when chances that an effective system could be up and working by 2005 were slim.</p>
        <p>In the last several months, the domestic political landscape changed as well. With Republicans like Senators Hagel and Smith calling for Mr. Clinton to defer, Mr. Gore was shielded to some extent from any fallout if the administration left the decisions to the next president.</p>
        <p>The administration has always been ambivalent about a limited missile defense system, arguing for years that the threat did not warrant spending billions of dollars on unproven technology, which had its origins in the vaunted Star Wars proposal of the Reagan years.</p>
        <p>But the White House did an abrupt about-face in mid-1998 after two things happened. First, a bipartisan commission headed by Donald H. Rumsfeld, a Republican and former defense secretary, warned that within five years North Korea and Iran could conceivably reach the United States with long-range missiles.</p>
        <p>Then six weeks later, as if on cue, North Korea surprised American intelligence experts by testing a three-stage missile with perhaps enough range to hit North America.</p>
        <p>By early last year, the White House was pledging its conditional support and $10.5 billion over six years to a limited system. Last summer, Mr. Clinton signed into law the National Missile Defense Act, which requires the United States to field a national defense against a limited strike when technologically feasible.  An original sponsor of the legislation was Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat who is now Mr. Gore's running mate.</p>
