        <p>Slocum, in his 12th season as the Aggies' coach, has heard rumblings about his job security grow louder after an 8-4 season in 1999.

        <p>They coached together, jogged together, even caught a livestock show or two together while calling College Station, Tex., their home and the Aggies their team. Now Texas A&amp;M Coach R. C. Slocum and Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie will face each other Saturday in an emotional opener.</p>
        <p>Slocum, in his 12th season as the Aggies' coach, has heard rumblings about his job security grow louder after an 8-4 season in 1999. It does not matter that he has won 100 games faster than anyone except Oklahoma's Barry Switzer and Nebraska's Tom Osborne, or that his 102 victories represent an average of nine a season. Aggie fans do not like their team getting shut out in secondary bowls, as Texas A&amp;M was by Penn State in the Alamo Bowl.</p>
        <p>''Well, if he's under fire, I'm under ashes,'' said Davie, who was Slocum's defensive coordinator before joining Lou Holtz's staff at Notre Dame in 1994. ''I'm already burned and toasted.''</p>
        <p>Davie, in his fourth year as head coach, is indeed feeling the pressure.  The Irish lost their final four games last season to finish 5-7, their most losses since 1963. The National Collegiate Athletic Association handed Notre Dame its first penalty -- probation for two years and the loss of two scholarships -- because of gifts accepted by players from a convicted embezzler in the Holtz years.</p>
        <p>The combined trauma was enough for the university to hire Kevin White from Arizona State as its new athletic director and to realign the department so that the athletic director reports directly to the university's president, the Rev. Edward A. Malloy.</p>
        <p>''You know the reality is we lost our last four games last year, and regardless of the reasons, that's not acceptable here at Notre Dame,'' said Davie, who is 21-16 as head coach. ''I can certainly see why there may be a perception on the outside that I need to win X amount of games to save my job.''</p>
        <p>Many people will be tuned to marquee games like Alabama, ranked No. 3 in the Associated Press news media poll, at U.C.L.A., and No. 22 Southern Mississippi at No. 13 Tennessee. Many more will watch Davie and the Irish begin what could be a march toward oblivion. Notre Dame's first five games feature tough opponents.</p>
        <p>''I think this year playing Texas A&amp;M, this is probably even bigger, not just because of how we finished last year, but we have so many personal ties when it comes to this football game,'' Davie said. ''We have 20 players on our team from Texas, 7 of them starters, 2 of them captains.''</p>
        <p>The Aggies are ranked No. 25 in the A.P. poll. Like the Irish, Texas A&amp;M will start an unproven quarterback, Mark Farris, who is a 25-year-old former minor league baseball player. The Irish will counter with Arnaz Battle, a junior, who has thrown only 35 passes in the past two seasons as a backup to the departed Jarious Jackson.</p>
        <p>But Grant Irons, one of Notre Dame's captains, said the team knew its mission.</p>
        <p>''We didn't come to Notre Dame to be 5-7,'' said Irons, a defensive end.</p>
        <p>Slocum understands his former assistant's precarious position. But Slocum's response about the stakes of Saturday's game shows he is confident Davie can overcome it.</p>
        <p>''Come late Saturday afternoon,'' Slocum said, ''one of us will feel pretty good and the other is going to be miserable.''</p>
        <p>Davie does not want his team to be distracted by the discussion of his job status.</p>
        <p>''I do think we made progress as a football team, and I'm not going to spend a second thinking about how many wins this football teams has to have for me to be back here as the head coach,'' said Davie, who received a five-year contract extension last year. ''I'm going to focus on each game, and let it rip, and let's go play.''</p>
