        <p>Questioning the truthfulness of statements made by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, a federal judge has awarded $1 million in punitive damages to a small Connecticut company that brought an antitrust suit against Microsoft.</p>

        <p>Questioning the truthfulness of statements made by Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, a federal judge has awarded $1 million in punitive damages to a small Connecticut company that brought an antitrust suit against Microsoft.</p>
        <p>The ruling late Thursday in Bridgeport, Conn., was hailed as a vindication by the plaintiff, Bristol Technologies. Bristol was the developer of a ''software bridge'' intended to ease the creation of programs that could run on both the Unix operating system and Microsoft's industrial-strength counterpart, Windows NT.</p>
        <p>The company accused Microsoft of an unfair effort to change the terms of their business relationship after Windows NT gained a foothold in the market and Microsoft lost its incentive to foster the use of Unix.</p>
        <p>In July 1999, a jury found that Microsoft committed a deceptive act that violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, but rejected the rest of Bristol's case. And rather than the hundreds of millions of dollars in damages that Bristol sought, it awarded the company just $1. Microsoft executives at the time hailed the jury's finding and minimal fine as a validation of the company's business practices.</p>
        <p>But Judge Janet C. Hall, who was permitted to award punitive damages under last year's verdict, ruled Thursday that the deceptive conduct in which Microsoft had engaged ''rises to the level of reckless and wanton indifference to the harm it caused Bristol and others.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, she noted that a $1 million penalty against a company like Microsoft, with $14.5 billion in revenue, would be unlikely to deter it in the future.</p>
        <p>In any case, the Connecticut ruling is another legal problem for Microsoft, which is appealing the landmark antitrust case brought by the Justice Department and 19 states.</p>
        <p>''Given Microsoft's resources, this is an extraordinarily light-handed sanction,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school. ''But it is something that Microsoft must continue to watch. It's conceivable that the state courts will pay close attention to her findings.'' Microsoft faces a number of class-action suits by consumers in the wake of the federal antitrust decision in April.</p>
        <p>Judge Hall specified that the decision in the Justice Department case was not relevant to the issues at the heart of the Bristol case. But she was critical of Microsoft's business practices, asserting that Mr. Gates gave an intentionally false statement during a 1996 speech in which he assured other software companies and customers that Microsoft would continue to provide its latest products for conversion to Unix programs.</p>
        <p>''Stripped from the veil of Microsoft's protestations that it merely engaged in highly competitive behavior,'' she wrote, Microsoft's deceptive statements ''are, at their core, like a classic bait-and-switch tactic'' against independent software vendors, developers and ''Unix users whom Microsoft sought to convert to Windows.''</p>
        <p>In the suit, Bristol said that when renegotiating the contract for its link-up software, Microsoft did offer Bristol a new license, but charged four times the previous price and granted far less access to Microsoft technology.</p>
        <p>Microsoft officials said yesterday that the company planned to appeal the judge's decision.</p>
        <p>For its part, Bristol, a small software company based in Danbury, Conn., said that based on the Bridgeport ruling, the company planned to ask for a new trial. ''This is a vindication that we were right,'' said Jean Blackwell, Bristol's vice president for sales and marketing.</p>
        <p>In addition, a Bristol lawyer said Microsoft might find itself in a more difficult position in a European Commission antitrust investigation into the company's business practices.</p>
        <p>''This ruling is a brief to the European Commission,'' said the lawyer, Patrick Lynch. ''It involves exactly the area where they have focused their investigation.''</p>
        <p>Bristol entered into a contract with Microsoft between 1994 and 1997 under which Microsoft was to provide Bristol with access to the programmers' instructions for an early version of Windows NT.</p>
        <p>But as Microsoft's power in that marketplace began to grow, the company had less interest in letting companies like Bristol develop products that would ease the integration between Windows and Unix, which had gained an earlier foothold.</p>
        <p>In her ruling Thursday, the judge cited a 1994 open letter by a Microsoft manager stating the company's commitment to make its application program interfaces ''universally available'' for Unix computer systems. Application program interfaces are the keys to an operating system that enable programmers to make their software run efficiently.</p>
