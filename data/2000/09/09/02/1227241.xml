        <p>Ben W. Perkins Jr. was surprised that his 2-year-old filly Stormy Pick was sent off as the 9-2 second favorite to a maiden in today's 109th running of the $200,000 Spinaway Stakes. Perkins, however, was not startled by the result.</p>
        <p>Ridden by Jose Ferrer, Stormy Pick scored an easy, front-running victory over the 31-1 shot Nasty Storm to take the first Grade I juvenile stakes race of the season. For Stormy Pick, the dark bay Florida-bred daughter of Storm Creek and the Peterhof mare Program Pick, the victory was her fourth in five career starts for the owner Raymond Dweck.</p>

        <p>Ben W. Perkins Jr. was surprised that his 2-year-old filly Stormy Pick was sent off as the 9-2 second favorite to a maiden in today's 109th running of the $200,000 Spinaway Stakes. Perkins, however, was not startled by the result.</p>
        <p>Ridden by Jose Ferrer, Stormy Pick scored an easy, front-running victory over the 31-1 shot Nasty Storm to take the first Grade I juvenile stakes race of the season. For Stormy Pick, the dark bay Florida-bred daughter of Storm Creek and the Peterhof mare Program Pick, the victory was her fourth in five career starts for the owner Raymond Dweck.</p>
        <p>After covering the seven furlongs in a sharp 1 minute 24.33 seconds to win by two lengths, Stormy Pick returned $11.40 on a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>''She was the most experienced and tested horse in the race, and we said we would just take it to them,'' said Perkins, who shipped in Stormy Pick from Monmouth Park, his home base in Oceanport, N.J.</p>
        <p>Stormy Pick did just that. The third-place finisher, Seeking It All, was the 7-5 favorite despite never having won a race. As for the lack of respect from the bettors, Perkins said ''it was kind of hard to figure out.''</p>
        <p>It should be less difficult to predict  the favorite in Saturday's 96th running of the Grade I $200,000 Hopeful for 2-year-old colts at seven furlongs. Only three horses have swept Saratoga's three major juvenile stakes for 2-year-old colts and geldings. Only one, Dehere in 1993, has netted the hat trick since Campfire in 1916. The other horse to do it was actually a filly: Regret, in 1914, the year before she became the first filly to win the Kentucky Derby.</p>
        <p>The Linda Rice-trained City Zip has a chance to duplicate the feat. City Zip, a chestnut colt, has reeled off three graded stakes victories in a row under Jose Santos: the Grade III Tremont at Belmont on July 3, the Grade II Sanford here July 27, and the Grade II Saratoga Special on Aug. 16.</p>
