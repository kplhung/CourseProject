        <p>For 12 years, Al Groh has had the same game-day routine and he is not about to deviate from it now. He craves stability, so there will be no quirky rituals, nothing to mark the extraordinary nature of this particular Sunday in Green Bay, Wis. His wife, Anne, will stay home and watch on television her husband's first game as the head coach of the Jets.</p>
        <p>''Business trip,'' was Groh's explanation when asked why he was being a minimalist for the occasion.</p>
        <p>That is the message Groh sent in training camp: all business. Almost every player -- and even some coaches -- said Groh's training camp was one of the toughest they had experienced, and some of them grumbled about it. In one practice, receiver Yatil Green attempted to catch a pass by fully extending himself. Green, who did not make the catch,  bounced up and spoke to Groh for a few moments as he passed him. Groh never looked away from his list of things to accomplish.</p>
        <p>So far, this approach seems to have befuddled some of his players. If they are comfortable knowing that most of the personnel and schemes are the same as they were under the former coach Bill Parcells, then they are still trying to figure out what to make of Groh. Center Kevin Mawae compared the process of getting used to a new coach as similar to settling into a new car.</p>
        <p>''We're still looking, still trying to figure it out right now,'' Mawae said. ''His coaching style is a lot different than a lot of players are used to. That's one of the things we've been trying to adjust to. Practices are a little bit quieter than they used to be, for one.''</p>
        <p>Parcells was known for his bluster and banter. Groh's style is marked by his incredible attention to detail. Groh's talks to the players after several practices during training camp lasted nearly 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Bill was just being Bill,'' Groh said of Parcells. ''Players had to respond to Bill being Bill. I'm just being me. Ultimately, players will have to respond to that. As you look around the league at coaches who have been successful, there are two or three things they have in common. They all coached the team the way they think it should be coached. They're all tough minded and they're all demanding.''</p>
        <p>Groh has deliberately avoided shaking up the Jets. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde has noticed only subtle changes in practice schedules and routines. Groh seems hesitant to tinker with what brought Parcells success. The two have known each other for 30 years, and Groh has no trouble admitting that many of his coaching priorities -- if not his personal style -- derive from Parcells's formulas.</p>
        <p>''Put yourself in Al's shoes,'' defensive lineman Ernie Logan said of his coach. ''What good is it going to do you to worry about the guy you're coming after? You just have to put the team together the best you can. I think he's learned from some of the mistakes other coaches who followed Parcells have made, and I don't think he's going to make the same mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Said running back Curtis Martin: ''He's emphasized a lot of characteristics the team already has. One of the things I commend him on is he didn't try to rebuild just to let you know it's Al's team. He has the respect; we know it's Al's team. He came in and built upon what we do well. We worked very hard in this camp.''</p>
        <p>That has not been lost on anyone. When asked if players had seen the lighter side of Groh during practice, left tackle Jason Fabini raised his eyebrows and shook his head firmly.</p>
        <p>''I don't really know Al that well,'' receiver Wayne Chrebet said. ''I guess this is his philosophy: go out, get the work done and we'll have a few laughs later on.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps. Linebacker Dwayne Gordon predicts that the entire coaching staff will loosen up after the first game.</p>
        <p>''They're seeing just what Al Groh is all about,'' Gordon said. ''They're seeing a guy who is very detailed in his work, who doesn't leave a stone unturned, who is very diligent in his preparation -- which helped us linebackers last year. He makes sure that nothing you see in a game is a surprise. In the press conferences, I'm sure he's very stern. But behind the scenes, when he pulls you aside, he can be funny and warm. All those things a normal person would be. He's got a good grasp of what the team needs, but he can throw in a joke. I'll tell you this, if we win this game in Green Bay, he'll be smiling on Monday.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>JASON FABINI, who won his appeal on Friday, does not have to pay the $14,900 fine that the National Football League levied against him for his role in a bar fight last summer that led to JUMBO ELLIOTT's one-game suspension. . . . The newly acquired long snapper, BRAD BANTA, who beat out the Jets' former snapper JOHN HUDSON for the job, will also serve as the third tight end behind the starter FRED BAXTER and the rookie ANTHONY BECHT.</p>
