        <p>Residents of Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif, who have by choice picked up their mail at post office--opting for routine of bumping into one another and avoiding confusion of carriers delivering mail to houses without addresses--are up in arms over decision by Postal Service to begin free home delivery pending assignment of street numbers; houses in small community have always been identified either by name or folksy descriptions of their location; map; photo (M)</p>

        <p>This is a town that cultivates eccentricity like a rare organic tomato. Ever since it was discovered by artists, writers and assorted free spirits nearly 100 years ago, people have been drawn to this precious-as-a-poodle community beside the Pacific Ocean for the touches of modernity it does not have: street lights, illuminated signs, parking meters, neighborhood sidewalks, street addresses and door-to-door mail delivery.</p>
        <p>As long as there has been a Carmel-by-the-Sea (not to be confused with Carmel, the broader area surrounding this one-square-mile ''urban forest'' that tourists flock to see), residents have, by choice, picked up their mail at the post office, opting for the routine of bumping into one another among the oaken post boxes and avoiding the confusion of carriers delivering mail to houses without addresses. Houses here, many of them elfin cottages with thatchlike roofs in the Late Troll style, have always been identified either by name -- like Tide Pool or Tinkerbell -- or by folksy descriptions of their location (second house southwest of 7th on Camino Real).</p>

        <p>This is a town that cultivates eccentricity like a rare organic tomato. Ever since it was discovered by artists, writers and assorted free spirits nearly 100 years ago, people have been drawn to this precious-as-a-poodle community beside the Pacific Ocean for the touches of modernity it does not have: street lights, illuminated signs, parking meters, neighborhood sidewalks, street addresses and door-to-door mail delivery.</p>
        <p>As long as there has been a Carmel-by-the-Sea (not to be confused with Carmel, the broader area surrounding this one-square-mile ''urban forest'' that tourists flock to see), residents have, by choice, picked up their mail at the post office, opting for the routine of bumping into one another among the oaken post boxes and avoiding the confusion of carriers delivering mail to houses without addresses. Houses here, many of them elfin cottages with thatchlike roofs in the Late Troll style, have always been identified either by name -- like Tide Pool or Tinkerbell -- or by folksy descriptions of their location (second house southwest of 7th on Camino Real).</p>
        <p>Thus, a significant tempest in a Teapot (the name of another house here) ensued when, after months of aggressive lobbying by a determined citizen, the United States Postal Service announced at a packed City Hall last month that free home delivery, pending the assignment of street numbers, would finally be offered in Carmel-by-the-Sea.</p>
        <p>To Joe Steinfeld, the choice is clear. Mr. Steinfeld, who is 71, has led the campaign for mail delivery since he moved here last year from nearby Big Sur, visiting Postal Service headquarters in Washington twice, telephoning members of the service's board of governors at home and picketing the post office here with a sign that said ''Choice Not Boxes.''</p>
        <p>''I can get pizza delivered to my house, but not the mail,'' Mr. Steinfeld said. ''They call it a quaint tradition. It's not quaint. We're paying for something we're not getting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinfeld, a retired antiques dealer who ran unsuccessfully for the City Council on the mail issue, became frustrated about lack of home delivery after an illness left him bedridden and unable to pick up his mail.</p>
        <p>Among his supporters is Tom Conmy, 66, a packaging broker, who does not see the charm in threading his car through about 25,000 summertime tourists a week strolling to the 111 art galleries and perusing 15-carat Cartier diamond rings -- all to get to the post office.</p>
        <p>But many in town see Mr. Steinfeld's quest as an assault on a cherished community tradition that has larger reverberations.</p>
        <p>''It's just another step towards the homogenization of Carmel,'' said Alice Englander, 54, a computer programmer, who has taken to calling her town ''Stepford-by-the-Sea.''</p>
        <p>''It's the difference between McDonald's and a roadside cafe,'' she said. ''Next, the mailmen will need street lights to see the boxes, then sidewalks for safety, and soon we'll be one of those places that used to be wonderful but aren't anymore, like La Jolla or Laguna Beach.</p>
        <p>''This is one square mile that's different,'' she added. ''The people who don't want that can live in the rest of the country.''</p>
        <p>The post office here looms large. It is ''like the old cracker barrel of a general store or neighbors talking over a backyard fence,'' said Steve Bardin, 56, who has occasionally found a lipstick pucker mark on the window of his box after a spat with a girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Here, Carmelites encounter Dan Tarallo, 64, ''the whistler,'' who improvises tunes from his ''inner radio'' twice a day on the post office bench, and neighbors like Kathleen and Isabel Blythe, 75-year-old twins who use the excursion as an excuse to ''get out of the house every day, have lunch and throw out the dumb catalogs before we go home,'' in Kathleen Blythe's words.</p>
        <p>The post office is a public spot in a famously private town.</p>
        <p>''It creates connections between people,'' said Barbara Bolgard, who is 66. ''It's, 'I had a dream about you last night -- are you all right?' Well, the mailman is not going to do that.''</p>
        <p>Carmel-by-the-Sea is one of about 4,400 independent post offices, including rural offices, that do not have carrier delivery, said Mark Saunders, a spokesman for the Postal Service in Washington. Indeed, Mr. Saunders said, the service was not legally obligated to provide home delivery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinfeld has threatened to file a class-action suit on behalf of Carmel-by-the-Sea's box renters, who he said were entitled to a 97-year refund, which he has calculated as $30 million, for having paid rental fees for post office boxes throughout the town's history when mail delivery, he said, is ''supposed to be free.''</p>
        <p>In fact, box holders in Carmel-by-the-Sea, who pay about $14 a year, are entitled to a fee refund dating from June 1997, when free post office box service became available to qualifying municipalities, Mr. Saunders said. (Mr. Steinfeld collects his mail at nearby Pebble Beach because there is a long waiting list for Carmel boxes.)</p>
        <p>Among the strongest supporters of street numbering here, which would be required for mail delivery, is the city's fire chief, Bill Hill, a third-generation Carmelite who estimates the price of idiosyncrasy as ''about a minute longer'' in emergency response time.</p>
        <p>The 911 dispatchers are based in Salinas, about 30 miles away. ''Put yourself in their hands,'' Chief Hill said, when a caller explains where the emergency is to be found by saying, ''Well, there's a blue Volvo parked in front.''</p>
        <p>David Louie, a longtime United Parcel Service driver, said that new drivers avoid Carmel-by-the-Sea. ''Sometimes a customer gives out an address and even they don't know where they live,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The politics of mail isn't new in this formerly bohemian community, once home to Upton Sinclair and Robinson Jeffers and today better known as the hideaway of Doris Day, Kim Novak and the football announcer John Madden. Former Mayor Clint Eastwood, whose rugged profile adorns tote bags and mugs here, now lives up the coast in Pebble Beach.</p>
        <p>In 1926, the city adopted an ordinance to number its houses, but the measure was ignored until it was officially repealed in 1940. Thirteen years later, the city threatened to secede from the state over a gas-tax bill that would have required it to number its streets. The bill failed.</p>
        <p>Throughout its history, the town has, in effect, legislated uniqueness, a boon to tourism. For instance, Carmel has a ''high heels'' ordinance, inspired by the town's crooked, uneven streets, requiring a permit to wear shoes with heels more than two inches high and with less than ''one square inch of bearing surface.''</p>
        <p>Now Carmelites will have a choice of mail delivery. But the debate is not over: this week the City Council will decide whether to ban street numbers or mailboxes on streets, potentially challenging the postal service. The service says it will deliver, regardless.</p>
        <p>In anticipation, Mr. Steinfeld has put a mailbox up in front of his house. But others in town, like J. B. Williams, who describes herself as ''ancient'' and walks very slowly to the post office each weekday with her cane, say they will continue to pick up mail, by hook or crook.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to give up Box 12,'' she said resolutely. ''It belonged to the family.''</p>
