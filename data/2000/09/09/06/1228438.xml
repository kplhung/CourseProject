        <p>New Haven geared up for the Eastern League playoffs by taking the last three games of a four-game series with the Binghamton Mets, the Ravens' opponent in the three-of-five-game Northern Division championship series that begins tonight in Binghamton, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The designated hitter JUAN THOMAS homered, a 12th-inning grand slam, in his third consecutive game Monday, as the Ravens won the last game of the regular season, 9-3.

        <p>New Haven geared up for the Eastern League playoffs by taking the last three games of a four-game series with the Binghamton Mets, the Ravens' opponent in the three-of-five-game Northern Division championship series that begins tonight in Binghamton, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The designated hitter JUAN THOMAS homered, a 12th-inning grand slam, in his third consecutive game Monday, as the Ravens won the last game of the regular season, 9-3. With his 27th homer of the season, Thomas was the fifth consecutive batter to reach base in the six-run inning. JAKE WEBER also had two homers for New Haven, including one in the 12th.</p>
        <p>Thomas had two home runs Sunday in a 5-2 victory over the Mets, who still finished first in the division. The right-hander GREG WOOTEN notched his league-high 17th victory. New Haven clinched a playoff spot with an 11-4 victory on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Reading, the Southern Division leader, will play the winner of last night's one-game playoff between Akron and Harrisburg, which finished in a tie for second.</p>
        <p>The regular season did not end nearly as well for the Ravens' in-state rival at New Britain. Trenton's MARC LEWIS was one of five hitters to drive in two runs during an 11-run second inning Monday, sending the Rock Cats to their league-worst 17th straight defeat. Since Aug. 21, the Minnesota Twins affiliate is just 6-28. The right-hander KYLE LOHSE dropped his final 14 decisions. Over the last several weeks, the Rock Cats lost their top hitter, outfielder BOB KIELTY, and the reliever SAUL RIVERA to promotions when the players were sent to Class AAA Salt Lake City. In addition, the team lost the left-handed starter BRAD THOMAS to the Australian Olympic team.</p>
        <p>The Trenton Thunder, meanwhile, became the first Class AA team to draw more than 400,000 fans in six consecutive seasons.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK-PENN LEAGUE</p>
        <p>The Pittsfield, Mass., franchise, slated to move to Troy, N.Y., next season, will play one more season at the 81-year-old Wahconah Park in Pittsfield after the ownership group, the National Pastime Corp., reached an agreement with the city. The team, which will lose its Mets affiliation after this season, will move into a new facility on the campus of Hudson Valley Community College in Troy for the 2002 season.  Staten Island's CHIEN-MING WANG fired a six-hit shutout in beating Oneonta by 7-0. Wang, a 20-year-old from Taiwan, struck out 11.  The Yankees got more solid pitching Monday when the left-hander ANDY BEAL struck out a season-high 13 in a 2-1 victory over the New Jersey Cardinals. Beal, a fifth-round pick out of Vanderbilt University, is 5-1 in his last six starts.  The Vermont Expos set a team record with 10 stolen bases in a 6-4 victory over Lowell. The Expos, who were not caught stealing in the game, stole home three times and completed a triple steal. The team has a league-leading 172 thefts in 71 games.</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL LEAGUE</p>
        <p>ALFONSO SORIANO tuned up for an expected September call-up to the Yankees with four hits and five runs batted in Sunday for Columbus in the Clippers' 12-7 loss to Toledo. Soriano hit a pair of two-run homers and added a run-scoring double.  Norfolk's DENNIS SPRINGER pitched his first complete game of the season Monday, a 5-0, five-hit shutout of Richmond.</p>
        <p>MAKING THE MOVE</p>
        <p>The Lakewood, N.J., BlueClaws, the South Atlantic League team that will move from Fayetteville, N.C., next season, unveiled their logo last week. The team's caps will feature a crab cradling a baseball with various shades of blue and some red, which was adopted from the parent Phillies.</p>
        <p>The team, formerly known as the Cape Fear Crocs, had a sorry finish in Fayetteville, now the largest metropolitan area in the state without a pro baseball team. The team's final three home games of the season were rained out. So the franchise's farewell home game was a 4-1 loss before a crowd of 187.</p>
        <p>INDEPENDENT LEAGUES</p>
        <p>Madison was four games out of first place with four to play, all against Duluth-Superior, the leader of the Northern League's Central-East Division. So naturally the Black Wolf forced a one-game playoff for the second-half title by completing a four-game sweep on ERIC METZGER's R.B.I. double in the bottom of the ninth Friday night. The Dukes' ANTHONY LEWIS put an end to Madison's magic, however, clinching the league's triple crown in a 6-3 victory in the playoff. Lewis went 3 for 4, including his 33rd homer. He also hit .365 with 89 R.B.I.  Somerset's BILLY HALL stole his Atlantic League-record 90th base Saturday.  The Atlantic League's Long Island Ducks drew their 52nd sellout of the season and their 39th in a row Sunday when 6,049 filled EAB Park in Central Islip, N.Y., for the Ducks' 5-1 victory over Lehigh Valley.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ROBERT STRATTON, selected 13th over all by the Mets in 1996, drove in five runs in St. Lucie's 11-2 victory over Vero Beach. Stratton has a team-high 29 homers this season but leads the Class A Florida State League with 179 strikeouts in 377 at-bats.  J.P. WOODWARD, a 14th-round pick of the Padres this year, drove in 11 runs Saturday in a 25-12 Idaho Falls victory over Ogden in a Class A Pioneer League game. Woodward had two three-run homers among his six hits.</p>
