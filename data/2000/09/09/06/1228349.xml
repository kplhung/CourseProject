        <p>Now we know what Dennis Miller sounds like in a great game when he has consciously dialed back his shtick.</p>
        <p>Mediocre. Maybe not even necessary.</p>
        <p>Miller Lite is not what ABC was looking for when it hired Miller for ''Monday Night Football.'' Yet that is what he provided during St. Louis's exciting 41-36 victory over Denver. Dan Fouts became the undisputed No. 2 voice in the booth, and Miller reduced himself to comments like, ''Not surprising that the ball may be slippery for a guy named Griese.''</p>
        <p>Or, trying to be statistically profound, he said, ''Testimony to Terrell Davis's greatness: He didn't play last year and he's still averaged 1,000 yards a year for the past two.'' Sorry, babe, he did play last season, rushing for 211 yards in four games before tearing up his knee, although he did gain 2,008 yards in 1998.</p>
        <p>Or, this nugget of wisdom that my gym coach once told me: ''You can't teach quicks.''</p>
        <p>Miller's travails Monday night may be traced to nerves or the vintage 1970's banana-yellow ''Wide World of Sports'' blazer he wore. But ABC's Miller Dilemma is this: it dreams of having classic games like Monday night's, and yet such riveting broadcasts will restrict Miller's verbal reveries and point him toward too much football analysis, at which he is deficient.</p>
        <p>Viewers simply don't need Miller to tell them that Kurt Warner, the Rams' quarterback, is ''impervious'' to a pass rush or ''downright contemplative in the pocket,'' unless he's prepared for a rapid analysis that goes beyond saying the former Arena Football League player ''must feel like he's coming from the bumper pool table to the snooker table.''</p>
        <p>When Al Michaels noted that the Denver offensive line lacks anyone weighing more than 300 pounds, Miller added that the Broncos' offensive line coach is light, too. When did players start reflecting the physical characteristics of their coaches? Did any of the old Jets reflect Weeb Ewbank's short, dumpy look? Did any New Orleans Saints adopt Hank Stram's hairdo?</p>
        <p>Sad to say, the Miller imitator mocked mercilessly during the Fox pre-game show on Sunday was funnier than the real Miller on Monday night. Regrettably, I must report chuckles emanating from my mouth during Jimmy Kimmel's segment with ''Miller,'' who said, ''Hey, Kimmel, nice place you've got here. It's like Gepetto and his brotherhood of Italian puppeteer Local 257 set up shop in a Kosovar bomb shelter, babe.''</p>
        <p>Miller encroached into the troubling terrain of overfamiliarity. Four times he labeled Denver Coach Mike Shanahan a genius and twice he referred to him as Shanny. Maybe that's the swingin' Rat Pack way of doing things, but hearing Miller sound like he has been swapping offensive schemes with Shanahan for decades pushes the comedian's ''analyst'' role.</p>
        <p>And if you're going to shill your network's programs, be accurate. ''Let's hope Charlie Sheen is the comeback player of the year in sitcoms,'' Miller said, regarding Sheen's addition to the ''Spin City'' cast. Sheen has never been in a sitcom.</p>
        <p>Miller needs the room to be funny and obscure, to make people wonder what planet he's from and to use the game as his foil. Like Warner, he's got to air it out, and the producer Don Ohlmeyer has to give him the room to do it, even in tight, exciting games. Because if Miller is to be the 21st century Howard Cosell, or at least someone provocative enough to make people watch to hear what he will say next, he will not do it by saying, ''Shanny's got to love the resiliency of his team.''</p>
        <p>As for Fouts, well, he's still just an O.K. analyst. Ohlmeyer said he had detected a breakthrough in the last preseason game, but Fouts seemed to be offering up the obvious most of the time on Monday night. In one play early in the game, he praised Denver's Rod Smith for reaching back to catch the ball on a long reception. Isn't that what a wideout is supposed to do?</p>
        <p>Fouts also lauded the ''makeup speed'' of the St. Louis cornerback Dexter McCleon when he batted away a Griese pass. But the replay clearly showed the ball was too high to be caught and was coming back McCleon's way.</p>
        <p>Michaels displayed his usual mastery of play-by-play, and called Miller ''baby'' only once. Because Miller wasn't very funny, Michaels wasn't laughing. He also did what was necessary to describe the four felony charges against the Denver linebacker Bill Romanowski, who is accused of using diet drugs prescribed for his wife and a friend.</p>
        <p>Down on the sideline, Melissa Stark wasn't creating a new paradigm for her role. She delivered the news about Davis's ankle injury, but asked softball questions of Paul Tagliabue, the National Football League commissioner.</p>
        <p>Eric Dickerson, the other sideline reporter, was so smartly underused Monday night that he all but disappeared from ABC's radar. What he contributed was nearly useless and badly presented. Last week, Ohlmeyer said he regretted pushing Dickerson into a reporter's role so quickly and was converting him to a sideline expert analyst. He's no better at that, and his on-the-job training is painful to watch.</p>
        <p>The production, led by Ohlmeyer and the new director, Drew Esocoff, looked sharp. The use of the tiny camera on the umpire's cap revealed some terrific shots, and the cameraman toting the ''Steadicam'' produced excellent angles of sideline scampers. Does that guy have 4.4 speed? The halftime program improved simply by not being set in an ESPN Zone restaurant, but showed a lack of creativity with a stale compilation of NFL Films bloopers. Doesn't everyone have that video at home?</p>
        <p>The game produced a 15.9 overnight Nielsen rating, down from a 16.2 for last season's first game, which was played a week later, but up 8.9 percent from a Labor Day opening game two years ago.</p>
