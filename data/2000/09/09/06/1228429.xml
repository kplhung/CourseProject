        <p>After a doctor struggled to shove David Cone's left, nonthrowing shoulder back into place tonight, Cone stifled the inevitable sadness over his latest setback and mustered some levity. ''I guess this makes your decision about the post-season roster a lot easier,'' he joked to Yankees Manager Joe Torre, while sitting on the trainer's table.</p>
        <p>Despite dislocating his shoulder while making a diving catch in the third inning, there is a chance that Cone could come back in the last two weeks of the season. He could start a game or two and make a last bid to participate in the playoffs, at the end of his sixth and perhaps final year with the Yankees. If that does not happen, Cone will feel as if this is a fitting end to a horrible season.</p>
        <p>When Cone was helped off the field in agony, the gate to the visitors' bullpen in left field swung open and Dwight Gooden jogged across the outfield here to relieve his longtime teammate, to help his own chances of being on the post-season roster. Gooden threw five and a third innings and collected his 194th career victory as the Yankees dumped Kansas City, 10-5. Clay Bellinger, David Justice and Scott Brosius each slugged home runs among 17 hits for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Cone walked into the clubhouse after the game shirtless, without any wrapping whatsoever on his left shoulder. But as he pulled on an olive-colored shirt, the trainer Gene Monahan stepped through a throng of reporters. ''Let me put this on first,'' Monahan said, holding a sling.</p>
        <p>Cone raised both hands to his chest as Monahan eased the sling over his left elbow, then buttoned his shirt. Cone, who will have an M.R.I. exam Wednesday morning, spoke hopefully of a return this season, reporting what he was told, that there does not seem to be any additional damage. He keeps his hands below his shoulders in his pitching motion; maybe it would just be a question of how much pain he could stand, or whether he could raise his left arm quickly enough to protect himself.</p>
        <p>Cone also mentioned other possibilities, that he would not pitch again this year. ''I definitely do not want my career to end this way.''</p>
        <p>Pitching in the third inning against his former team, in his hometown, Cone rushed off the mound in pursuit of a bunt popped up by the Kansas City shortstop Rey Sanchez; moving toward third base, Cone extended his left-handed glove and dove, parallel to the ground. He caught the ball in midair -- and landed heavily on his left elbow. Cone immediately rolled over in pain, writhing, his left arm prone at his side, panicked, realizing his shoulder was out of its socket, yelling at Monahan to not touch him. ''It felt like my shoulder was in my neck,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Cone's body slumped toward his left side, in the direction of the damaged shoulder, as Monahan quickly helped him to his feet and off the field, Cone's body slumped toward his left side. Royals fans, who cheered for Cone when he broke into the majors in 1986, and again in 1993 and 1994 after he signed with Kansas City as a free agent, clapped in support of Cone as he departed. His father and mother, Ed and Joan Cone, watched from the stands before heading for the Yankees' clubhouse.</p>
        <p>Steve Joyce, the Royals' team doctor, worked for 15 minutes to maneuver Cone's shoulder back into place; Joyce was having so much trouble that at one point, there was talk of moving Cone to the hospital for the procedure.</p>
        <p>Cone was eventually taken to a local hospital for X-rays, which revealed no fractures, and his teammates were surprised to see him moving his left hand and arm after the game. ''I feel like I dodged a bullet,'' Cone said. ''Judging by how I feel now, I feel pretty lucky.''</p>
        <p>The injury comes at a time when the 37-year-old Cone seemed to be rebounding, in the last weeks of what has been a frustrating year. Cone, 4-11 with a 6.16 earned run average over all, had no victories for more than three months, his record 1-10 after the Minnesota Twins pounded him for nine hits and eight runs in five innings on July 27. Cone went to the Yankees' minor league facility in Tampa, Fla., on the orders of the Yankees' owner George Steinbrenner, worked on his mechanics and regained some confidence.</p>
        <p>Cone ended his streak without a victory Aug. 10, and in his five outings leading up to tonight's game against the Royals last night, Cone was 3-1 with a 3.86 E.R.A., contributing to the Yankees' recent surge in the American League East standings.</p>
        <p>With the Yankees closing in on their third consecutive division title and their sixth straight appearance in the post-season, it appears as if Cone will not be part of the post-season rotation, regardless of the condition of his shoulder and how it impacts what he does. Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte, Orlando Hernandez and Denny Neagle are likely to make up the Yankees' rotation in October.</p>
        <p>Still, Cone seemed to be building his case to be part of the Yankees' pitching staff in October. The injury has changed everything, of course. He will be evaluated closely in his last outings this season -- if he has any more outings. When Gooden approached and asked how Cone was doing after the game, Cone mentioned to Gooden, half-joking, that he must have done something wrong to somebody to deserve everything that has happened to him this year.</p>
        <p>Clemens, Pettitte and Hernandez are already signed for next year, and Neagle -- acquired in a major post-season deal -- is negotiating a multiyear deal, and the Yankees may well decide against retaining Cone for next year.</p>
        <p>Cone has not said explicitly that he intends to pitch again next year, but he is 16 victories short of reaching 200 for his career -- this could be a benchmark for his Hall of Fame credentials -- and his late-season effectiveness has convinced him he is capable of winning in the big leagues. He admitted he was in no frame of mind tonight to worry about all of that.</p>
        <p>''I'm still hopeful I can help this team,'' Cone said. ''If that's not the case, I've got some hard thinking to do.''</p>
