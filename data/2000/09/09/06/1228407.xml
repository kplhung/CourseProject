        <p>Now, the producers of the CBS reality series ''Big Brother'' are getting really serious.</p>
        <p>Determined to get someone now in the ''Big Brother'' house to quit the show, the producers intend to increase a cash offer to contestants to more than $20,000.</p>
        <p>The money will go tonight to the first one who is willing to quit the camera-filled house in which he or she has been locked for the last two months.</p>
        <p>The idea is to create an opening so a new contestant, a 22-year-old woman named Beth, can be inserted in the house -- and, the producers fervently hope -- stir things up. But after word that $10,000 would be offered was reported on Monday, several fans of the current cast took to displaying signs around the house to tell the participants the offer was coming and urging them to reject it.</p>
        <p>That is the last thing the Big Brother producers want to see happen. So they plan to up the ante further.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the number will ''certainly go higher than $20,000,'' said Eddie Michaels, a spokesman.</p>
        <p>All of this is intended to light some kind of fire under what is considered an increasingly sparkless show. At a time when the ratings had been expected to improve because the number of possible winners was down to six, they are slipping.</p>
        <p>How far will the producers go to squeeze someone out of the house? Mr. Michaels would not say. But the show's winner is to get $500,000, with $100,000 going to the second-place finisher and $50,000 to the third.</p>
