        <p>State Senator Larry B. Seabrook, who is a candidate in a bitter race for Congress, allowed reporters yesterday to see his tax documents, which indicated that he had filed joint tax returns for two years after his divorce became official in 1993.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester, made his tax documents from 1992 through 1999 available in the Bronx office of his lawyer, Armando Montano. For weeks, the tax issue has dominated Mr. Seabrook's highly charged race against United States Representative Eliot L. Engel, a six-term congressman.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Seabrook acknowledged that he had continued to file the joint returns after his divorce became final, but said that his lawyer had failed to notify him when the  divorce became official. Mr. Seabrook said that although he and his wife, LaVerne, were estranged, he continued to live in the basement apartment of the four-family building where they lived, while she remained in an apartment upstairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook said that once he learned that the divorce was final, he moved from the apartment in the Bronx and began filing returns in his name only. ''In that year, my daughter graduated from high school and went to college,'' he said. ''I had fulfilled my promise to her not to leave the house until she did.''</p>
        <p>He listed an apartment in Half Moon, N.Y., near Albany, as his address for the two years after he began filing single returns. He said  that he later moved into an apartment in Co-op City in the Bronx. Mr. Montano took responsibility yesterday for failing to inform the senator when his divorce became final.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seabrook reiterated his charge that information regarding his taxes and his divorce were leaked to the press by Mr. Engel, his opponent in the Democratic primary. ''We know that this is something that people close to Mr. Engel are responsible for,'' Mr. Seabrook said. ''And this is politics in the lowest form.''</p>
        <p>He called on Mr. Engel to release his tax documents. Joseph O'Brien, a spokesman for Mr. Engel, said the representative's accountants were preparing his documents to be released in the next few days. Mr. Engel has maintained that he had no knowledge of what was contained in Mr. Seabrook's tax statements.</p>
        <p>The Bronx Democratic Party is backing Mr. Seabrook, breaking with its tradition of supporting incumbents.</p>
