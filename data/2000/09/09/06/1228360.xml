        <p>As foreign dignitaries around for the United Nations summit meeting began to descend on the streets of New York City yesterday, the police issued their post-rush hour traffic diagnosis with a sigh of relief: the run-up to the gathering was, more or less, a success.</p>
        <p>''Things were much better than we anticipated,'' said Inspector James Hegarty, who commands the traffic control division of the New York Police Department. ''We did not have any serious major gridlock situations.''</p>
        <p>But the authorities predict major gridlock today and tomorrow, as the three-day gathering of world leaders begins in earnest. Delegates are expected to clog roadways as they travel in motorcades among their hotels, United Nations headquarters, private meetings and cocktail parties. But yesterday, Inspector Hegarty said, New Yorkers appeared to have heeded the warnings of the police and the mayor, opting for public transportation and, in general, staying off of the roads.</p>
        <p>''Less than typical Christmas traffic'' is how he summed it up.</p>
        <p>About 150 traffic control agents and police officers patrolled the streets of Manhattan yesterday. Even so, there were a few snags, with the most prominent points of congestion occurring near political demonstrations.</p>
        <p>A group protesting the Iranian government stopped traffic as it made its way from 43rd Street and Madison Avenue to 47th Street between First and Second Avenues. Although the marchers confined themselves to the sidewalks, traffic was temporarily held up as they walked across streets and avenues, the police said. The police kept the traffic flowing, albeit slowly, by alternating the right of way between drivers and marchers.</p>
        <p>Another group protesting Iran caused further disruptions at 5 p.m, when 18 demonstrators dashed into the street at 49th Street and First Avenue, sat down and refused to leave, the police said. When the police arrived, they arrested the 10 men and 8 women, charging each with disorderly conduct. Traffic was backed up for at least half an hour, Inspector Hegarty said, and the police had to back some cars out of the First Avenue tunnel.</p>
        <p>Fidel Castro caused backups at several points between noon and 4 p.m., as his motorcade drove to the Cuban mission, on Lexington Avenue and 38th Street, and also paid visits to several other delegations, the police said. Traffic was cleared on Lexington Avenue between 38th and 48th Streets, they said.</p>
        <p>Drivers on the West Side also felt the brunt of the world's leaders yesterday, as traffic diverted from closed-off East Side streets gravitated westward. The Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue were backed up, the police said.</p>
