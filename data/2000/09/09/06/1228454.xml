        <p>If you were a youngster in the 1940's or 1950's, you may remember the expression ''mystery meat'' coming up in the school cafeteria line. (At least there was a carton of milk -- sometimes even chocolate.) Nostalgia buffs, or younger folk curious about The Time Before Pizza, might want to visit an exhibition on the federal school lunch program running through October at the Staten Island Ferry terminal in St. George.</p>
        <p>Mounted by the NY Food Museum, an organization that sponsors food-related exhibitions, it surveys how federal lunch programs came to be in the 1930's, and how politicians, farmers and food companies all had a role in shaping them. It also looks at the relationship between good nutrition and learning.</p>
