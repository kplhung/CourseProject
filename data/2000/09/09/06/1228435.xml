        <p>Twenty-five years ago, Martina Navratilova left the U.S.T.A. National Tennis Center after losing in the semifinals to Chris Evert, and traveled to the Immigration and Naturalization Service office to ask for political asylum. The 18-year-old from Czechoslovakia did not tell her family that she was defecting.</p>
        <p>''Mostly what I remember is what I see in press conference blurbs on TV, how very thick my accent was then,'' Navratilova, now 43, said yesterday. ''I had no idea how big it was. I didn't know it was such a pivotal point. I knew it was pivotal point for me personally, but I didn't realize it was such a big point in my life as a public person.''</p>

        <p>Twenty-five years ago, Martina Navratilova left the U.S.T.A. National Tennis Center after losing in the semifinals to Chris Evert, and traveled to the Immigration and Naturalization Service office to ask for political asylum. The 18-year-old from Czechoslovakia did not tell her family that she was defecting.</p>
        <p>''Mostly what I remember is what I see in press conference blurbs on TV, how very thick my accent was then,'' Navratilova, now 43, said yesterday. ''I had no idea how big it was. I didn't know it was such a pivotal point. I knew it was pivotal point for me personally, but I didn't realize it was such a big point in my life as a public person.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, she and Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario lost in the third round of the Open to seventh-seeded Anke Huber and Barbara Schett, 6-3, 6-2.</p>
        <p>During her retirement, she learned to fly, tried her hand at carpentry and had a photo exhibition in Prague. But she wanted to play tennis again, and has been stunned by the reception she has received.</p>
        <p>''What I'm getting from the crowd I never got in my life, even the last couple of years on the tour,'' she said. ''This is special. This is good.''</p>
        <p>When asked if there was anything else she wanted, her eyes began to water. ''I want to be a better person,'' she said. ''I have a long way to go for that.''</p>
