        <p>KINN-Phillip. The League Treatment Center mourns the loss of Phillip Kinn, Jewish Holocaust resistance fighter, born in Iwje, Poland. Through his great acts of courage and loyalty Phillip was relentless in saving family and friends. He fought in three armies against the Nazis, and as a resistance fighter blew up bridges and train tracks. He was a hero. He and his late wife Sonia, also a resistance fighter, will be profoundly missed by his son Dr. Mark Kinn, daughter, author Gail Kinn, daughter-in-law Hannah Achtenberg Kinn, and her sister Linda, and his treasured granddaughter Sarah Frieda Kinn. His strength remains an inspiration. Funeral services were held Tuesday, Sept. 5 at 11:30 AM at Parkside Funeral Home, 2576 Flatbush Ave, Broooklyn, NY.</p>
        <p>KINN-Phillip. The Board of Trustees of The League Treatment Center mourns the passing of Phillip Kinn.
