        <p>To help meet growing demand from business customers that outsource management of their Internet operations to I.B.M.'s Global Services unit, I.B.M. said it agreed to lease space in nine AT&amp;T data centers . I.B.M. said that the deal, valued at $450 million, would allow it to begin selling Internet services and computer capacity at AT&amp;T centers in the New York, Chicago, and Phoenix areas by the end of the year and in six other cities by the third quarter of 2001. I.B.M. now operates 12 Web-operation sites in the United States, 6 of them in partnership with other vendors. Earlier this year, it announced plans to create 56 more sites around the world, including 28 sites in the United States with Qwest Communications.</p>
