        <p>When Edson Arantes do Nascimento was 18, he used to run onto the soccer field with a 130-pound sack of coffee beans on his back. Even then, in the days before Colombia's Juan Valdez stole the limelight from Brazilian coffee, the young man known as Pele was already using his fame to promote his country's products abroad.</p>
        <p>Some things never change. In a new role as good-will ambassador for the Brazilian oil giant Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, Pele, who turns 60 next month, is lending the considerable weight of his name to another company with international aspirations.</p>
        <p>''Petrobras is a Brazilian company that made good, just like Pele is a Brazilian who made good,'' Pele said in an interview here. ''I can help Petrobras project that image abroad.''</p>
        <p>Petrobras is one of a growing number of Brazilian companies that have become competitive enough in recent years to turn their sights toward the international market. Like most of the others, though, the oil company is hard pressed to come up with the investment capital in Brazil needed to finance its efforts. So Petrobras has sought international investors.</p>
        <p>The problem, though, is that Petrobras, the world's seventh-largest publicly traded oil company, is not well known outside Brazil. The fact that most of the company's oil is used by Brazilians has not helped. Nor did the company's 45-year reign as a state-owned monopoly.</p>
        <p>Petrobras formally lost its monopoly five years ago, and Brazil is now in the process of opening the energy market to full competition. To compete against the likes of Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon Mobil, the company is increasingly feeling the pressure to go global. Indeed, Petrobras has plans to spend $33 billion over the next five years to double its current production and buy up oil exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of West Africa.</p>
        <p>''We want to expand abroad,'' said Henri Philippe Reichstul, the president of Petrobras, when the promotion contract was announced. ''Pele, his legend, will be our ambassador.''</p>
        <p>But the job will not be easy. In years past, Brazil has gotten more headlines abroad from its political antics, violence and environmental damage than its business acumen.</p>
        <p>Pele said that in his many years of travel, the most frequent question he has been asked is how Brazil is going to overcome its chronic corruption.</p>
        <p>''I am sad about the negative propaganda that our politicians create for Brazil abroad,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, the administration of Brazil has been terrible, and it is just starting to get better now.''</p>
        <p>Petrobras also has its own baggage. The company was responsible for two extensive oil spills this year that have tainted its reputation in and outside Brazil. The first spill, in January, flooded Guanabara Bay in Rio de Janeiro with 325,000 gallons of oil, blackening some famed beaches and endangering a fragile nature preserve. After a thorough mea culpa by Mr. Reichstul, Petrobras thought it had put the troubles behind, when another spill, this time on the Iguacu River in July, sent a million more gallons of oil into Brazilian waterways.</p>
        <p>That is where Pele comes in, with 43 years as an international icon.</p>
        <p>''Pele is without a doubt the most well-known Brazilian in the world,'' said Washington Olivetto, president and creative director of W/Brasil, a leading advertising agency in Sao Paulo.</p>
        <p>Prominent in his resume are Pele's efforts to help put Pepsi-Cola behind both the Iron Curtain and the Great Wall of China. He turned MasterCard International, with which he has a continuing relationship as spokesman, into something approaching a household name. And perhaps most challenging, for a short time in the late 1970's, his efforts on behalf of the North American Soccer League brought early attention to professional soccer in the United States.</p>
        <p>After a stint as Brazil's minister of sports from 1995 to 1998, during which he tried to remake the legislation that governed the country's soccer teams, Pele has settled into roles as good-will ambassador for several United Nations agencies and spokesman in Brazil for the Finnish cellular phone giant Nokia, among other things.</p>
        <p>He is already hard at work for Petrobras. Last month, in his first ambassadorial mission, he made a personal appearance at the New York Stock Exchange for the company's newest share offering. The government sold about $4.4 billion in stock, or 17 percent of Petrobras, to domestic and foreign investors.</p>
        <p>''For a Brazilian company to be understood as being Brazilian, Pele is an extremely efficient spokesman,'' Mr. Olivetto said. ''It is much easier to explain what Petrobras is to foreigners by using Pele.''</p>
        <p>Over the two years of his contract, he will take part in commercials, publicity campaigns, speeches and personal appearances for Petrobras.</p>
        <p>''Although, running with a barrel of oil on my back,'' Pele remarked with a grin, ''now that could get a little complicated.''</p>
