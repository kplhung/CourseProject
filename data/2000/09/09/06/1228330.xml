        <p>THE INTEREST GROUPS</p>
        <p>ATTACKING BUSH ON GUNS -- Handgun Control Inc., a nonprofit lobbying group, will begin running a television advertisement in five swing states on Wednesday that sharply criticizes Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Handgun Control plans to spend more than $1 million on the effort, the largest in its history, said Joe Sudbay, the organization's political director. Mr. Sudbay said the commercial would initially run in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee and St. Louis, the largest cities in five of the most closely contested states.</p>
        <p>The 30-second spot, which is similar to one the group ran earlier, says Mr. Bush signed laws that allow Texans to carry concealed handguns. It then cuts to Kayne Robinson, first vice president of the National Rifle Association, saying that if Mr. Bush wins, ''We'll have a president where we work out of their office.''</p>

        <p>Dan Bartlett, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, objected to the portrayal. ''Governor Bush has said he will be the only one working out of the office,'' Mr. Bartlett said.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY -- On a swing through Midwest battleground states, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut said yesterday that Democrats were the best stewards of the economy, while Republicans would return the government to huge deficits. Speaking to the breakfast crowd at a diner in Peoria, Ill., and at a forum in a St. Louis suburb, Mr. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said that Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, had promised tax cuts and new spending that would leave the federal government more than $1 trillion in debt.</p>
        <p>''After their tax cuts, there's no money left over in the till, unless you're going to go back into deficit again,'' he said at Oakville Senior High School. And Mr. Lieberman called the Medicare prescription drug plan unveiled by Mr. Bush today unworkable. ''I don't know where Governor Bush is going to get the money,'' he said. ''There's nothing left after the big tax cut.''</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>SUPPORT FOR HEMP -- Ralph Nader on Tuesday joined people who want to grow and market industrial hemp in criticizing federal agencies for making it difficult to grow the crop. Mr. Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate, also spoke out against a recent raid on a South Dakota Indian reservation in which federal agents seized at least 2,000 plants the owner said were industrial-grade hemp.</p>
        <p>Hemp cannot be grown commercially in the United States because it is in the same family as marijuana, although Mr. Nader pointed out that the levels of hallucinogenic THC are far lower in hemp than in marijuana. ''It is analogous to consuming poppy seed bagels or nonalcoholic beer,'' he said. ''Although these foods both have a small psychoactive component, people do not abuse them.'' Mr. Nader said the Drug Enforcement Administration was proposing rules requiring that a product containing any THC be listed in the same category as heroin and LSD.</p>
