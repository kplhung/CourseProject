        <p>Echoing a familiar refrain in the Web consulting industry, Xpedior warned that it expected revenue in the third quarter to drop about 10 percent from the $62.9 million in the second quarter of this year, largely because of diminished demand from dot-com clients. Wall Street, in turn, reacted as it did when it first heard that concern last week from two other companies: Xpedior's stock dropped $2.56, or 23.7 percent, to close at $8.25, well off its 52-week high of $34.75. It did not seem to matter that the company estimated that third-quarter revenue would climb 65 percent from the $34.5 million posted in the 1999 quarter.</p>
