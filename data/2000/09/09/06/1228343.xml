        <p>As a battle between supporters and opponents of democratic reform rages at home, President Mohammad Khatami of Iran came to the United Nations today to promote his campaign for a global ''dialogue among civilizations'' and to praise his country as one of the world's oldest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khatami, a midranking cleric who was swept to victory in a popular election three years ago on a platform promoting the rule of law, delivered a highly theoretical speech that offered no concrete proposal on how to promote global dialogue, no talk of his promises to promote reform at home and no mention of any country except his own.</p>

        <p>As a battle between supporters and opponents of democratic reform rages at home, President Mohammad Khatami of Iran came to the United Nations today to promote his campaign for a global ''dialogue among civilizations'' and to praise his country as one of the world's oldest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khatami, a midranking cleric who was swept to victory in a popular election three years ago on a platform promoting the rule of law, delivered a highly theoretical speech that offered no concrete proposal on how to promote global dialogue, no talk of his promises to promote reform at home and no mention of any country except his own.</p>
        <p>Wearing a clerical robe and cloak and the black turban signifying that he is a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, Mr. Khatami instead quoted from the Koran and the 14th-century poet Hafiz and spoke of the importance of artists and poets, mystical thought and Islamic civilization and of the lack of empathy and compassion in the world.</p>
        <p>''Let us hope that enmity and oppression should end, and that the clamor of love for truth, justice and human dignity should prevail,'' Mr. Khatami told an audience of several hundred, including a number of heads of state and invited Iranian expatriates.</p>
        <p>He also warned about the dangers of unlimited globalization, saying, ''Global culture cannot and should not overlook the characteristics and requirements of local cultures with the aim of imposing itself on them.''</p>
        <p>Seated in the front row of the audience a few yards away from Mr. Khatami was Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who came to New York early today to hear his 30-minute speech.</p>
        <p>She applauded him twice -- when he was introduced and again at the end of his speech -- and left the conference room before any of the other speakers took the podium.</p>
        <p>Despite the vagueness of much of the speech by Mr. Khatami, who was trained in philosophy at the University of Isfahan, Dr. Albright later called it thought-provoking and interesting.</p>
        <p>A senior State Department official explained that Dr. Albright had attended because ''there is no official dialogue with Iran at this point and we wanted to send a signal to the Iranians that we're willing to listen to what they have to say.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Albright also wanted to be present after she learned that Mr. Khatami would be seated in the General Assembly hall on Wednesday when President Clinton addresses the Assembly's 55th session, the official added.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Albright and Mr. Khatami steered clear of each other at a reception just before the conference today, and Mr. Clinton will not try to meet his Iranian counterpart on Wednesday, the State Department official said.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has pressed Iran to open an official dialogue as a first step toward drawing a ''road map'' for the eventual normalization of relations, but Iran has repeatedly refused.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Khatami became president in 1997, one of his main themes has been the need for a ''dialogue among civilizations,'' code words for bridging the gap between an Islamic government like Iran's, which is still subject to American economic sanctions, and secular nations around the world.</p>
        <p>He proposed making 2001 the year of such dialogue in his maiden speech before the General Assembly two years ago. Today's event was the kickoff of that endeavor as well as the prelude to the opening of the annual Assembly session and the three-day summit meeting that will bring together more than 150 world leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khatami's appearance today was dramatically different from his United Nations debut two years ago. Back then he had been president for a little more than a year, and he wooed a receptive global audience with talk of how freedom-loving and law-abiding Iran was becoming.</p>
        <p>Now, Iran's reformist press is shut down, many of its reformist journalists and clerics have been imprisoned and its judiciary, dominated by ultra-conservative clerics, is determined to punish any behavior it considers un-Islamic.</p>
        <p>Last month, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, who under the country's Constitution wields much more power than Mr. Khatami, stunned the nation when he directly intervened in the affairs of the newly elected Parliament, ordering it not to consider amending a restrictive press law.</p>
        <p>More recently, vigilantes forcibly prevented two reformist leaders from speaking in the western industrial city of Khurramabad, touching off days of rioting in which a policeman was killed and more than 100 people were injured.</p>
        <p>Near the Iranian mission to the United Nations today, at about the same time that Mr. Khatami was speaking, a rally sponsored by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations demanded the release of 10 Iranian Jews convicted of espionage in July.</p>
        <p>Among the speakers were Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, Representative Rick Lazio, the Republican candidate for the Senate in New York, and a number of Democrats including Representative Nita M. Lowey, also of New York.</p>
        <p>''We are here to send a message to the president of Iran and the people of Iran,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''The 10 do not stand alone. We are in solidarity with them.''</p>
        <p>''No more caviar and Iranian rugs while our brothers are kept in jail,'' said the New York City public advocate, Mark Green, referring to the recent easing of the economic embargo against Iran to allow Americans to import Iranian caviar, carpets and pistachios.</p>
        <p>A few blocks away, across the street from the United Nations, more than 1,000 Iranian protesters representing the United States-based National Council of Resistance of Iran stood under a cloud of red, white and green balloons, protesting Mr. Khatami's visit and demanding the overthrow of the Tehran government.</p>
        <p>''Death to Khatami!'' the protesters chanted as they waved the flags of the People's Mujahedeen, Iran's main armed resistance organization, which the State Department classifies as a terrorist group. One of their signs read, ''Murder, torture and execution continues in Iran.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Mr. Khatami met with a handpicked group of 500 Iranian businessmen, academics, students and artists, stoking their Persian pride and exhorting them to invest in their homeland.</p>
        <p>''Our hearts are beating for the love of one place, and this place is Iran,'' Mr. Khatami said.</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Khatami spoke, five expatriates delivered their own speeches.</p>
        <p>''Cultural freedom is not relative,'' said R. K. Ramazani, professor of government at the University of Virginia. He warned of ''national suicide'' if the Iranian people's demands for freedom are overlooked.</p>
        <p>Jahangir Ghaznavi, who heads a Pittsburgh investment company, drew loud applause when he suggested ways to attract Iranian expatriates back home.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Khatami, open the economic doors,'' he said. ''Make coming and going in and out of the country easier. Try to guarantee investments as is done in other countries. Remove political obstacles for investments.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago Mr. Khatami held a similar meeting with hundreds of expatriates. But that time he allowed the audience to ask questions in what turned out to be an extraordinarily freewheeling exchange. This time, in a sign of the times in Iran perhaps, no questions were allowed from the floor. There was only a box into which guests could deposit their questions and comments.</p>
