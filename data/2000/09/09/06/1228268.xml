        <p>MONTGOMERY-Robert H., Jr. The Board and Staff of the Alliance for the Arts mourn the passing of our beloved Chairman, Robert H. Montgomery, Jr. Since 1986, Bob guided us with gentle wisdom and steadiness. He was fatherly in his compassion, lawyerly in the clarity of his advice, but above all, elegant in his dealings with everyone. Having led a remarkable life, as friend and counsel to many important people, he was the most modest of men, always interested in others. His pride was in the accomplishments of his wife and children. We offer our profound sympathy to Henriette, Margaret and Sam. Bob was a mentor to many in his profession and encouraged the staff of the Alliance to think for themselves and to aim high. Our cultural life is diminished by his loss, but the Alliance will continue its work in Bob Montgomery's honor. We will miss him. Paul Beirne, Acting Chairman Randall Bourscheidt, President Anita Contini, Vice Chairman Karen Gifford, Vice Chairman</p>
