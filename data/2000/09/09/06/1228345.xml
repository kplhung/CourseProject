        <p>Infonet, a data communications company in California, has had exploratory talks about buying Equant, the Dutch telecommunications company born from an airline reservations system, people close to the talks said today.</p>
        <p>The discussions are in early stages and a deal is not imminent, people close to the situation said.</p>
        <p>Equant has talked with various telecommunications players over the summer including France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and Global Crossing, the telecommunications company based in Hamilton, Bermuda. None of those discussions resulted in a deal, although France Telecom is still interested in Equant, people close to the company said.</p>
        <p>Analysts have said Equant could be sold for 10 billion euros, or $8.9 billion.</p>
        <p>Both Infonet, based in El Segundo, Calif., and Equant provide telecommunications services to multinational corporations, and both have experienced red ink because of heavy costs to build networks. Combining the two would not only bring together complementary networks but would allow them to share the infrastructure costs.</p>
        <p>Equant shares have rebounded from their low of 37.8 euros in late July on speculation that the company might soon receive a bid. Shares rose 2.1 euros, or 4.2 percent, to 51.7 euros. Shares of Infonet rose 50 cents, to $15.38.</p>
        <p>Infonet raised $1 billion in January when it sold 17 percent of its shares. The remainder of the company is owned by other telecommunications firms, including Telefonica of Spain, KPN of the Netherlands, Telia of Sweden, Swisscom, KDD of Japan and Telestra of Australia.</p>
