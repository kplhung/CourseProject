      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of August 29 article and September 3 editorial regarding falloff in support for Boy Scouts because of their exclusion of gays</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A front-page article on Aug. 29 and an editorial on Sunday about a falloff in support for the Boy Scouts because of their exclusion of gays misstated two cities' reactions to the ban. Chicago no longer lets the Boy Scouts use parks, city buildings and schools without charge. The public schools of San Francisco no longer sponsor Scout recruitment drives or other programs during school hours. The Scouts are not barred from using parks, schools and other sites.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the timing of those restrictions. They began before the Supreme Court upheld the ban in June, not afterward.</p>
        <p>The article also cited one city erroneously among those that bar the Scouts from their facilities. Although one San Jose elementary school district, Alum Rock Union, does not permit recruiting or other Scout programs during school hours, the ban is attributed to demands on instructional time, not to the Scouts' policy.</p>

        <p>The article also misstated the number of United Way organizations that have stopped raising funds for the Scouts. It is about a dozen, not dozens.</p>
        <p>In addition, the article misstated the Roman Catholic Church's stance on the ordination of gays. Ordination requires a promise to live a celibate life. While the church condemns homosexual activity, it does not have a policy against ordaining gay men.</p>
