        <p>ROMILLY-Christopher James K. Beloved husband of Linda Jean Abbey, and inspirational friend to those who knew and loved him, Christopher James Kenworthy Romilly passed away September 5, 2000 after a long and brave battle with cancer. Chris will be remembered for his giant heart, his broad intellect, his great kindness, wide-ranging curiosity, and enormous passion for living. We thank the staff at Memorial Sloan-Kettering for their compassionate assistance in Chris's battle. Chris is also survived by his aunt and uncle, Alice and Peter Peterson, and his cousins: Charles Hunt, John Hunt, Sara Hunt, Peter Romilly, Martin Romilly, Mary Bain, John Peterson, Larry Peterson, and Sara Romilly. A memorial service will be held at a future date. Charitable donations in Chris's memory can be made to the S. Kent Legare Library at Suffield Academy, Alumni Office, Suffield, Connecticut.</p>
