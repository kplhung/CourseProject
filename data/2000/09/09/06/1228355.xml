        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>VATICAN: CATHOLICISM'S ROLE -- The Vatican issued a strong statement seeking to affirm and ''clarify'' Roman Catholic teaching on the uniqueness of Christianity and the Catholic Church. The document, written by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, says that salvation is available only through Jesus Christ and that Christ's church ''continues to exist fully only in the Catholic Church.'' It also says Christ's church is ''present and operative'' in other churches provided that they share a Catholic understanding of the Eucharist and preserve an ecclesial structure in which bishops trace their authority to the Apostles.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: TWINS CASE DELAYED -- Citing the complexities of the case, the Court of Appeal said it would be next week before it could decide whether a High Court judge was correct in giving doctors permission to proceed with an operation separating joined twins that would sacrifice the life of one to save the other. The parents, identified only as Catholics from a ''remote'' European community, said their faith compels them to let nature take its course even if it means the death of their children, born last month.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: DIANA GUARD'S NEW ROLE -- Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard who survived the crash three years ago in Paris that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, her boyfriend Emad Mohamed al-Fayed, known as Dodi, and their driver, Henri Paul, has taken a job with the United Nations as a security officer working with peacekeeping troops in East Timor, Indonesia. ''He's just getting on with his life,'' his lawyer, Ian Lucas, said of Mr. Rees-Jones, 32, a former paratrooper.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: OFFER TO EASE FUEL TAX -- The government and leaders of trucking unions agreed to reduce fuel taxes after two days of truck drivers' blockades of fuel depots led to widespread rationing. But the proposal still has to go before protesting union members, who have been calling for deeper cuts.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>ARGENTINA, CHILE: JOINT MANEUVERS -- The Argentine and Chilean navies, long suspicious rivals that almost went to war in 1978, conducted joint maneuvers in Argentine waters for the first time. After Chilean commanders aboard the Chilean frigate Condell were allowed to watch the Argentine Navy conduct antisubmarine maneuvers as well as precision artillery exercises, they and their Argentine colleagues pledged to build trust and friendship in the future.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: WAHID INQUIRY -- Parliament set up a 50-member panel to investigate the involvement of President Abdurrahman Wahid in two financial scandals. One concerns the disappearance of $4 million from the state logistics agency; the other concerns the president's use of a $2 million personal donation from the sultan of Brunei.</p>
        <p>Seth Mydans</p>
        <p>MYANMAR: WEST ACCUSED -- The government accused some Western nations and their diplomats of trying to stir up trouble in their defense of the pro-democracy leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been confined to her home this week. Apparently alluding to the United States and Britain, a top official said, ''They are creating unrest in the country by agitating a handful of disruptive and subversionist groups who will follow their dictates.''</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: KIDNAPPERS REJECT OFFER -- Muslim rebels holding an American hostage in a southern Philippine jungle refused to exchange him for a suspected guerrilla. Jeffrey Schilling, 24, of Oakland, Calif., ended a hunger strike and is being held in a heavily guarded bamboo hut, said a government envoy who visited the rebel camp.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>INDIA: FLOOD THREAT -- Thousands of victims of prolonged flooding in eastern India are without safe drinking water and are at serious risk of disease, according to a Red Cross delegation to the area. More than 10 million people have been affected by the rains and more than 300 lives lost in the states of Assam, Bihar and West Bengal.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: HEAVY LOSSES -- Government forces and the Tamil Tigers conceded heavy losses during the latest round of intense fighting in the northern peninsula of Jaffna. The attacks came as nominations closed for Oct. 10 parliamentary elections.</p>

        <p>PALESTINIANS: CRITICIZED ON RIGHTS -- Amnesty International said in a report that the Palestinian Authority had jailed without trial dozens of critics of its policies in the six years since it was set up. The report said human rights advocates, journalists, clerics and even government officials had been detained for weeks, even months, after speaking or writing about corruption, questioning peace talks or criticizing Yasir Arafat.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>NIGERIA: WARNING ON OIL -- The government said it would send troops within two weeks to the oil-producing Niger Delta if increasing vandalism against oil pipelines by black-market thieves did not stop. Pipeline explosions have killed hundreds of people scooping up leaking fuel. In the last deployment of troops to the delta, in November, soldiers destroyed the town of Odi, where 12 police officers had been killed.</p>

        <p>SENEGAL: BRITISH TROOPS FLY IN -- Britain sent 100 members of the Parachute Regiment to Dakar, Senegal, as efforts continued to free six British soldiers kidnapped by renegade militiamen in Sierra Leone. A British official, denying military action was imminent to free the hostages, said the paratroopers were being sent as a ''contingency'' measure.</p>
