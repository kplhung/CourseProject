        <p>This is a new 15-second commercial, called ''The Ringer,'' that the Lazio campaign began broadcasting statewide yesterday. The advertisement responds to a recent commercial by the New York State Democratic Party that says it features interviews with ''real'' New Yorkers, who express surprise and dismay with the voting record of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for United States Senate. The Lazio commercial tries to sharply question the credibility of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, pointing out that one of the ''real voters'' featured in the Democratic advertisement is a former employee of the Democratic-controlled State Assembly.</p>

        <p>This is a new 15-second commercial, called ''The Ringer,'' that the Lazio campaign began broadcasting statewide yesterday. The advertisement responds to a recent commercial by the New York State Democratic Party that says it features interviews with ''real'' New Yorkers, who express surprise and dismay with the voting record of Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for United States Senate. The Lazio commercial tries to sharply question the credibility of his Democratic opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, pointing out that one of the ''real voters'' featured in the Democratic advertisement is a former employee of the Democratic-controlled State Assembly.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Murphy Pintak Gautier Hudome Agency.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- A single shot of Mrs. Clinton appears at the top of the screen with images of the people featured in the recent Democratic commercial underneath. Then the image shifts to one person interviewed in the Clinton advertisement, a woman who was identified as Carol. As the Lazio advertisement continues, the following words flash across the screen: ''Carol -- 8 Years on the Democratic Assembly Payroll.'' The commercial's final words appear as white text on a black screen, saying: ''Hillary Clinton. You just can't trust her.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''Seen Hillary Clinton's new negative ad? Just who are these real voters? Meet Carol: eight years on the Democratic Assembly payroll. Another phony ad from Hillary Clinton. You just can't trust her.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- No one disputes that the woman featured in the Democratic advertisement, Carol Madow-Kolberg, once worked for a Democratic assemblyman as an office manager, as was first reported on Monday in Newsday. But the agreement ends there. The Lazio advertisement strongly suggests that the Democrats did not, as they insist, choose Ms. Madow-Kolberg randomly during a series of ''man on the street'' interviews. Instead, the Lazio commercial suggests, the Democrats planted her in the ad to get the kind of anti-Lazio reaction they needed. But state Democratic Party officials say they had no idea that she had worked for a Democratic member of the State Assembly. Democrats say that Ms. Madow-Kolberg, now retired, was chosen at random at a supermarket in White Plains, along with other people who appeared in the ad.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- What was most striking about the recent Democratic advertisement was that it claimed to feature interviews with ordinary New Yorkers reacting with alarm to Mr. Lazio's voting record in Congress. But the Lazio advertisement released yesterday raises the possibility that at least one interview had been staged, portraying Ms. Madow-Kolberg as nothing more than a plant. In the process, the advertisement focuses attention on what has become one of Mr. Lazio's biggest themes of the campaign: Mrs. Clinton's credibility. Hence the commercial's final words: ''You just can't trust her.'' Mr. Lazio has raised the issue of credibility in other ads, and he will no doubt continue to do so.</p>
