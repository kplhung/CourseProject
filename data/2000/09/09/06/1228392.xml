        <p>The Conservative leader, William Hague, set out 100 policy proposals today that his party hopes will help it defeat Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Labor Party in the coming national election.</p>
        <p>Titled ''Believing in Britain,'' the 32-page document stressed the party's determination to hold off any consideration that the country adopt the euro as its currency in common with continental nations and pledged legislation to halt what it said was the relinquishing of British sovereignty to a ''European superstate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hague accused the Labor government of squandering ''the rights and independence that so many of our countrymen lived for and sweated for and died for'' and concluded, ''Say whatever else you like about a Conservative Britain, but at least a Conservative Britain will still be Britain.''</p>
        <p>It is expected that Mr. Blair will call the next election for May, a date that will mark four years since Labor took power with a huge majority of 179 seats in Parliament. For three years, Labor has held onto a lead of almost 20 percentage points over the Conservatives in voter polls, making Mr. Blair the most enduringly popular prime minister in British history.</p>
        <p>But a series of government internal leaks and policy spats in May and June and simultaneous moves by Mr. Hague associating himself with emotive populist causes like law and order and blocking asylum seekers brought him within single digits of Mr. Blair.</p>
        <p>New polls now show Labor with the support of more than 50 percent of voters and the Conservatives with less than 30 percent, a margin that would produce an even larger government majority in Parliament than it gained in its landslide in 1997.</p>
        <p>Labor appears to have won back its following with proposals to overhaul the ailing National Health Service and to sharply step up funding for deteriorating public services. Mr. Hague, meanwhile, was obliged during the summer to abandon an absolute tax-cut pledge and sacrificed credibility as a future prime minister by giving an interview in August to a men's magazine in which he claimed he used to drink 14 pints of beer a day as a young man working on a truck making deliveries to pubs.</p>
        <p>On the contentious question of Europe, Mr. Blair has said he is in favor of the principle of Britain's joining the monetary union but will not schedule a promised referendum on the matter until he is convinced that entry would be economically advantageous to Britain. Mr. Hague argues that there should be no thought of proposals to adopt the common European currency whatever the circumstances until at least the end of the next Parliament, or 2006.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hague is focusing on Europe as the crucial election issue, aware that it is the area of most distinct contrast with Labor and that polls show two-thirds of the British public opposed to abandoning the pound for the euro. But his hard-line position causes him problems in his own party, some of whose more traditional members said today they believed in a less confrontational stance.</p>
        <p>A former Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Heseltine, said the party was being destabilized by ''rigid Euroskepticism,'' and the former Foreign Secretary Lord Howe said he found Mr. Hague's proposals to take back powers from Brussels ''deeply disturbing.'' He said that the European Union could not function ''if every member state claimed the right to interpret or limit its E.U. obligations to suit its own wishes.''</p>
