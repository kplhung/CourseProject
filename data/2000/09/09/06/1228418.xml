        <p>President Clinton is planning to hold separate meetings with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in New York on Wednesday, but none of those three parties to the long-suffering peace negotiations are optimistic that things will advance much.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton will certainly try to impress upon them, particularly on Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, a sense of urgency. But as they did at the close of the Camp David summit meeting in July, the two sides remain both closer to and farther than ever from a permanent peace agreement, frozen at a decisive moment that represents a test of their political strength and their will.</p>
        <p>Before them on the negotiating table still lies Jerusalem, waiting to be carved up. Only an unexpected shift in either side's position on the holy city's future status will allow them to progress to another summit meeting at the close of the United Nation's gathering of world leaders, American officials say.</p>
        <p>Despite several Israeli and American proposals for sharing sovereignty, Mr. Arafat has remained immovable on his longtime demand for full sovereignty over what is known in Arabic as Haram al Sharif, the sacred, bitterly contested nerve center of Jerusalem's walled Old City that Jews call the Temple Mount.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who met for 45 minutes tonight with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright in New York, is unwilling and too weak politically to concede what is considered the holiest Jewish site.</p>
        <p>After the meeting, Mr. Barak, in a statement issued in New York, ruled out any breakthrough unless Mr. Arafat changes his stand on the terms of a settlement. The statement said they ''agreed that without an open and realistic attitude'' by Mr. Arafat ''it will not be possible reach a breakthrough toward an agreement.''</p>
        <p>An American official said after the meeting that President Clinton's sessions with both Middle East leaders on Wednesday could be critical. He said there were still differences on all the core issues, including the future of Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>At Camp David, the parties had all forecast a gloom-and-doom scenario for September if this standoff continued. But the Israelis and the Palestinians are not, as predicted, at the precipice of bloody conflict. After failing to win international backing for his stance, Mr. Arafat appears prepared to postpone the declaration of statehood from his deadline of Sept. 13. That eliminates the prospect of an imminent collapse of the peace effort and a spasm of violence.</p>
        <p>Still, it is a matter of at most a few months before another moment of reckoning is upon the leaders. The Palestinian Central Council will meet this weekend to debate whether the statehood deadline should be pushed back to Nov. 15 or year's end. Mr. Clinton's presidency is drawing to a close.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Barak, his government in tatters, is starting to give up on reaching an agreement, close associates say. Publicly, he puts his chances at 50-50. ''But I feel him shifting focus,'' a close associate said. ''Not that he's lost interest. Obviously peace has been his obsessive priority. But his political situation is desperate, and he has to be realistic.''</p>
        <p>American and Israeli officials say they are having trouble reading Mr. Arafat right now. Is he engaging in brinkmanship, or is he genuinely unwilling to be budged from his longtime core positions?</p>
        <p>Palestinians, however, say Mr. Arafat's feelings seem quite clear. ''I think he's developing some negative attitudes toward your American president,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political expert. ''And if he's going to give the honor of a peace agreement, he'll give it to someone else at a later time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat's public statements, Palestinians say, represent a genuinely unwavering stance on East Jerusalem -- ''the heart of Palestine, the heart of Arabs, the heart of believers,'' as he told Arab foreign ministers in Cairo last weekend. His speech there emphasized that he would not be rushed into a bad deal.</p>
        <p>Some Palestinian experts say Mr. Arafat thinks it less risky to protract the conflict than to seal a deal that would be perceived as selling out not just Palestinian, but also Arab and Muslim rights. Many in the Arab world still believe that the Palestinians have the right to all of the former Palestine, not only the West Bank and Gaza Strip but what is internationally recognized as Israel, too. Mr. Arafat, the experts say, has been putting forth the compromise position of United Nations resolutions that call for Israeli withdrawal from all territory occupied in the 1967 war -- which includes all of East Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>''He has been fighting the extremists by the argument you have to abide by international legality -- not more,'' Mr. Khatib said. ''How can he tell them to live with less?''</p>
        <p>Experts also say Mr. Arafat is calculating that he can out-bluff Mr. Barak and outlive him politically. At the helm of a minority government, Mr. Barak is holding on to office by a thread -- one legislative vote -- until Parliament reconvenes at the end of October.</p>
        <p>The Americans are portraying Mr. Barak, who is willing to reconfigure Jerusalem along ethnic lines, as Mr. Arafat's dream peace partner. But the Palestinians are not as appreciative of his concessions as the Americans and the Israelis would like them to be, and they contend that the American and Israeli positions have become indistinguishable -- and allied against them.</p>
        <p>Having offered to guarantee unlimited access to the Western Wall, the Palestinians do not see why the Israelis cannot concede to them legal sovereignty over the Temple Mount, which they already control in practical terms. They dismiss as ideologically unacceptable and impractical the proposals on the table, which include declaring ''divine sovereignty'' over the Temple Mount -- that is, both sides would agree that God owns the site in all its layered history.</p>
        <p>The idea is reportedly under serious consideration, although many Israelis, too, scoff at it. ''Would God then pick up the garbage?'' an Israeli columnist asked this week. ''Whose God?'' another asked.</p>
        <p>Additionally, some Palestinian experts say, Mr. Arafat does not necessarily fear a right-wing Israeli government. Under the rightist government of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Palestinians enjoyed the embrace of ever fuller international support for their claims. Mr. Barak, on the other hand, has courted world opinion and regained Western backing for Israel, successfully portraying himself as a peacemaker willing to risk his hold on power to secure an agreement.</p>
        <p>But world opinion cannot keep Mr. Barak in power, and his domestic problems are severe -- so severe that it is unclear whether any agreement he achieved could stand the test of time. This is something else that the Palestinians know, robbing the moment of its urgency for them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak remains confident that he can win the Israeli public's backing for a far-reaching agreement that includes the reconfiguration of Jerusalem. Getting Parliament's support, however, would be difficult, if not impossible. So Mr. Barak would probably call for new elections, using an agreement as a platform, political experts say. Then, in order to get a more supportive Parliament elected, he would have to campaign not only for himself but for a center-left coalition.</p>
        <p>Without an agreement, Mr. Barak is on unsteady ground. He has indicated that he may put aside his peacemaking efforts and shift to his domestic agenda, undertaking the so-called civic revolution he proposed two weeks ago that would challenge many of the powers and privileges of traditional religious parties. He would seek to accomplish this by forging a unity government with the rightist Likud Party and others, he said.</p>
        <p>But this is problematic. ''It is almost impossible to shelve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for starters, and then the Likud has said that it is not interested,'' said Joseph Alpher, an expert on Israeli diplomacy who served as Mr. Barak's adviser during Camp David. Still, Ariel Sharon, the former general who heads the Likud, might be tempted into a transitional alliance if he is assured that no territorial concessions to the Palestinians would be made in the near future, Mr. Alpher said.</p>
        <p>Those complexities are sobering for peace advocates who see Camp David as a breakthrough, engaging the Israelis and the Palestinians in their most substantive discussions yet of the thorniest issues.</p>
