        <p>PROTECTING the rain forest. Ending child labor. Preserving a healthy planet. They all sound like political promises made by candidates. But they are also subjects touched upon in the first national campaign for Stonyfield Farm Inc. Yes, that's right, the company that sells yogurt.</p>
        <p>In this print campaign, there will be no beauty shots of delectable yogurt dripping off a spoon or any boasting about the brand's tasty flavors.

        <p>PROTECTING the rain forest. Ending child labor. Preserving a healthy planet. They all sound like political promises made by candidates. But they are also subjects touched upon in the first national campaign for Stonyfield Farm Inc. Yes, that's right, the company that sells yogurt.</p>
        <p>In this print campaign, there will be no beauty shots of delectable yogurt dripping off a spoon or any boasting about the brand's tasty flavors. Instead, the campaign takes on a more serious tone and centers on celebrities who are advocates of environmental causes or other projects, using them as the link between commendable causes and Stonyfield's own goal to change the world.</p>
        <p>Since the company was started 17 years ago, its dual mission has been to sell organic yogurt, while at the same time promoting social and environmental causes.</p>
        <p>''I have become confident that we're able to communicate our dual message,'' said Gary Hirshberg, the president and chief executive of Stonyfield Farm, based in Londonderry, N.H. ''When you put your personality out there through the medium of advertising, it can work.''</p>
        <p>Stonyfield Farm and other companies like Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc. and Body Shop International P.L.C. have been embracing environmental themes or offering to help organizations in a tactic known as cause-related marketing, which allows them to sell their products while enhancing their appeal to consumers.</p>
        <p>The motivation for the new campaign came from a concept created by Mr. Hirshberg that he calls ad-tivism, which combines advertising and activism. An ad formula was born and was then developed by eFlicksMedia in Boston into a campaign known as ''I do.''</p>
        <p>''What excited me was this possibility of being activists, but using advertising media and also taking advantage of the power of celebrity, which as we know, is sort of a dominant force in our culture,'' Mr. Hirshberg said.</p>
        <p>At a minimum, the use of celebrities could ''stop people from turning the page,'' Mr. Hirshberg said. But it could ''potentially do a lot more than that,'' demonstrating, for example, ''that the folks whom we admire and revere in fact have other sides and in fact use their power and their fame to do good,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One of the five print advertisements features Trudie Styler, an actress who is the wife of the musician Sting. A head shot of Ms. Styler is the main display set against a background of a rain forest. The ''I do'' headline is prominent, accompanied by descriptions of what she is ''committed to'' like: ''Protecting the rain forest and the people who live there. A sustainable environment. Healthy living through mind, body and soul. Organic gardening. Organic Luscious Lemon Yogurt. My family. Businesses run by people who care.''</p>
        <p>Another ad features Kerry Kennedy Cuomo, who is described as an author and activist. Her commitments are listed as: ''Human rights defenders. Stopping child labor. People who speak truth to power. A healthy planet for all children.  YoSqueeze yogurts for kids. Companies that take a stand.''</p>
        <p>The three other ads in the campaign feature Ken Burns, the filmmaker and historian; Rick Bayless, a restaurateur; and Mr. Hirshberg himself. In each of the ads, the product is placed strategically at the bottom of the ad accompanied by the tagline, ''Stonyfield Farm. Yogurt on a mission.'' The small print on the bottom states that no fee was paid to the subjects and that a contribution was made to their nonprofit environmental causes.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that immediately caused these activists to jump on board is that Stonyfield Farm was not paying them,'' Mr. Hirshberg said. ''Our proposition to the talent has been, 'How would you like to use your name, your activism and your positions to help put some money into causes you and we believe in?' So, frankly a number of nonprofits have already seen this as an opportunity to solicit their folks.''</p>
        <p>The campaign, with billings estimated at $2 million, began running in the September issues of magazines including Cooking Light, Gourmet, House &amp; Garden, Parenting, Martha Stewart Living and Utne Reader. The ads will run until the holidays and resume later with another batch of celebrities. As the campaign grows, the target audience will also broaden. Mr. Hirshberg said that the company was also thinking about radio ads.</p>
        <p>Selling yogurt with a cause has proved to be profitable. Over the last two and a half years, Stonyfield Farm has grown from being a regional brand to a national player, ranking No. 5, with 3.1 percent of the $1.95 billion national yogurt market. Stonyfield, with sales at $60.7 million, competes with major brands like Yoplait, the leader, which has 31.5 percent of the market, with sales of $614.2 million; Dannon, with 27.7 percent of the market and sales at $540 million; Breyers, with 8.2 percent and $159 million; and Colombo, with 4.1 percent and $80.4 million in sales.</p>
        <p>Just to get to that point, the company has relied greatly on word-of-mouth guerrilla marketing tactics that include passing out yogurt to consumers and asking pediatricians to spread the word on the product's nutritional benefits.</p>
        <p>The company has made inroads in luring both new customers and those of its rivals through efforts like its yogurt lid campaign, which carries ''call to action'' messages for everything from organic farming to gun control. Its charitable donations, which are 10 percent of its profits, go to groups like Share Our Strength, the antipoverty and hunger organization, and the Jane Goodall Institute, which promotes wildlife research and preservation.</p>
        <p>''When you feel good about choosing a product that is actually advancing the environment, then you develop a stronger loyalty than you'd ever develop from a company that's just saying, 'Hey, we just got a new flavor,' '' said Martha Shaw, the president and creative director at eFlicks.</p>
        <p>The national campaign is not the first advertising effort for the company. A year ago, it started a conventional product and brand-building effort in some regions created by Lynch Jarvis Jones in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>''I would have to say the results were mixed at best,'' Mr. Hirshberg said. ''We did not see that spike that one likes to see, and so as an advertising skeptic, I just felt that added more fuel to my fire that your message has to be perfect and your medium has to be perfect, and I don't think we got either right.''</p>
        <p>''If I hadn't come up the ad-tivism idea, I doubt we would be doing a national campaign,'' Mr. Hirshberg added. ''My hope is that the ad-tivism campaign will have legs. I feel it absolutely represents us, whether it sells more yogurt is the question.''</p>
