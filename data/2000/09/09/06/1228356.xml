        <p>Pauline Rhodd-Cummings won her seat in the State Assembly two years ago by prevailing in a special election against three other candidates. Five months later, she beat back a primary challenge, and then defeated two other candidates in the general election.</p>
        <p>But even after winning all those votes, Ms. Rhodd-Cummings continued to be viewed as a vulnerable member of the Assembly, though she has the backing of the Queens Democratic Party hierarchy.</p>
        <p>The primary on Tuesday offers no respite. Ms. Rhodd-Cummings is being challenged by a college professor who is a first-time candidate running a vigorous campaign that has undercurrents of ethnic politics.</p>
        <p>The challenger, Taj Rajkumar, teaches remedial reading at the Borough of Manhattan Community College. Mr. Rajkumar, who was born in Guyana, is looking for support from the growing number of Guyanese immigrants in the 31st Assembly District, which includes the southeastern Queens neighborhoods of South Ozone Park, Richmond Hill, Springfield Gardens and, across Jamaica Bay, Far Rockaway.</p>
        <p>The district is about 55 percent black and about 15 percent Hispanic. Luther Blake, a consultant on demographics, estimates that Guyanese immigrants are nearly 30 percent of the population. ''But how many of these immigrants are registered is the question,'' Mr. Blake said.</p>
        <p>Despite her incumbency and the party support she has received, the Jamaican-born Ms. Rhodd-Cummings said she was taking her challenger seriously. For one thing, Mr. Rajkumar has amassed twice as much campaign money as she has.</p>
        <p>And if, as expected, turnout is low, operating a campaign with a vigorous get-out-the-vote operation is considered critical to winning.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Rajkumar, 43, has raised about $40,000 to be used in the primary campaign, roughly half of which is from a loan he secured.</p>
        <p>He said Ms. Rhodd-Cummings had not provided effective leadership in her two years in office and that he would place far greater emphasis on developing educational programs, clinics to assist immigrants and programs to help residents get jobs.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rhodd-Cummings said she had raised nearly $20,000, and added that she would have to rely on her campaign foot soldiers and her record to make up for the shortfall.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rhodd-Cummings, a former bookkeeper in the garment industry, won her first political victory two years ago in the special election to fill the seat vacated by Gregory W. Meeks, who had just been elected to Congress.</p>
        <p>Before being elected to the Assembly, Ms. Rhodd-Cummings was the chairwoman of the economic development committee of her local community board. Her principal political benefactor is City Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins, who asked her to run for the Assembly seat.</p>
        <p>In this campaign, Ms. Rhodd-Cummings has highlighted not so much broad themes describing her views on issues, as much as her ability to deliver bread-and-butter services to the district. She speaks, for example, of her success at working with other leaders to have the old, coal-burning furnace removed from Far Rockaway High School and in obtaining $500,000 to renovating a building to be used as a technical college.</p>
        <p>She also talks of having the state's five-year capital budget include money to renovate the Mott Avenue subway station in Far Rockaway.</p>
        <p>''The fact of the matter is that I am the candidate that has the community's interest at heart,'' she said. ''My emphasis is to deliver to the people the things that they need to improve the conditions in the district. And I have been doing that.''</p>
        <p>The intensity of the campaign can be seen throughout the district's major thoroughfares, where posters of both candidates seem to be everywhere. Mr. Rajkumar's signs are most prominent along Liberty Avenue, which is dotted with markets and roti shops owned by Guyanese immigrants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rajkumar speaks with pride of his journey from being a newly arrived immigrant working in a garment district factory in Manhattan to earning a doctorate and becoming a college professor. ''My campaign is geared toward the needy, the poor, the homeless and the elderly,'' he said. ''I want to represent the people who have been forgotten.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rhodd-Cummings has been endorsed by Representative Meeks as well nearly every elected official in southeastern Queens, which leads most Queens politicians to predict that she will prevail. Still, Mr. Rajkumar said that what he lacked in political endorsements had been made up by the dozens of volunteers who have worked the streets of the district on his behalf every day.</p>
        <p>Both candidates maintain that they are not targeting any one group to the exclusion of another. ''My campaign is designed to appeal to everyone in this community,'' Ms. Rhodd-Cummings said. ''This is not an ethnic campaign. I'm running hard, and running everywhere in the district.''</p>
