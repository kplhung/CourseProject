        <p>IF you are one of those pessimists who react with fear and trembling to even the slightest sign that the economy is cooling, take some comfort from Bordeaux wine. Prices are just as high as ever.</p>
        <p>What follows is a personal selection of Bordeaux wines, all of them good and all of them selling for $30 or less. I won't call them bargains; for many people $30 is a lot of money to pay for a bottle of wine. It's only in comparison with top of the line Bordeaux that this gathering of bottles will begin to look good. The first growths continue to exist on another planet: the 1998 Lafite-Rothschild is around $175, and the 1998 Haut-Brion around $275. Both the Petrus and the Chateau Le Pin 1998's hover around $1,000 a bottle.</p>

        <p>IF you are one of those pessimists who react with fear and trembling to even the slightest sign that the economy is cooling, take some comfort from Bordeaux wine. Prices are just as high as ever.</p>
        <p>What follows is a personal selection of Bordeaux wines, all of them good and all of them selling for $30 or less. I won't call them bargains; for many people $30 is a lot of money to pay for a bottle of wine. It's only in comparison with top of the line Bordeaux that this gathering of bottles will begin to look good. The first growths continue to exist on another planet: the 1998 Lafite-Rothschild is around $175, and the 1998 Haut-Brion around $275. Both the Petrus and the Chateau Le Pin 1998's hover around $1,000 a bottle.</p>
        <p>The down-to-earth wines recommended here are mostly from the 1997 vintage, a very good year in Bordeaux if not a memorable one. The classic Bordeaux ploy -- figure out what the market can bear, and add 20 percent -- applied to 1997. The wines were overpriced. But there are some moderately priced ones and, for the most part, they are ready to drink now. After the movies and most restaurants, isn't it pleasant not to have to wait for something?</p>
        <p>For good Bordeaux at reasonable prices, it's usually prudent to look first to the lesser appellations like Fronsac and Canon-Fronsac. But good wines can be found in more prestigious places, too. In the Margaux appellation, for example, Chateaux d'Angludet, du Tertre and d'Issan are all priced at $30 or less. All offer the warmth, soft tannins, medium body and good fruit characteristic of this vintage.</p>
        <p>Prieure-Lichine, in Cantenac, which is part of the Margaux appellation, gained a reputation for good, occasionally outstanding wines under the late Alexis Lichine. The 1997 is light, pleasant and . . . well, inconsequential. Better, perhaps, to opt for the appealing and more substantial 1997 Chateau Giscours at about the same price -- $27 -- and wait for the 1998 Prieure, which I'm told is a blockbuster.</p>
        <p>From Moulis, one of the towns just west of Margaux, I like Malmaison, a property rejuvenated by the late Edmond de Rothschild as a companion piece to his Chateau Clarke. Poujeaux, long a worthy competitor for wines far better known, is my favorite here for its intensity. But for the price, around $20, the more rounded Malmaison provides some very pleasant drinking. The Poujeaux is selling for around $27.</p>
        <p>A third Moulis property worth mentioning is Chateau Chasse-Spleen, whose 1997 is a bit more tannic than the two above and a trifle leaner. Many people like that in a Bordeaux. It's about $20.</p>
        <p>Among the famous communes of the Medoc, St.-Julien has always been noted for its rounder, more approachable wines. Much in that image is the 1997 Les Fiefs de Lagrange, the second wine of Chateau Lagrange. Lagrange itself is a full, elegant wine with firm but not harsh tannins. Les Fiefs has the same charm but is softer and more one-dimensional. A most attractive wine at about $22.</p>
        <p>From Pauillac, I liked the Carruades de Lafite, at just $30. This is the second wine of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and, as expected, it offers Lafite finesse if not the Lafite depth or length in the mouth.</p>
        <p>At the opposite end of the scale is an interesting little Pauillac property called Chateau Bernadotte. In 1997, May-Elaine de Lencquesaing, the owner of Chateau Pichon-Lalande, bought Bernadotte and set about reviving the house and vineyards. The wine is getting better, and it's about $15.</p>
        <p>The Medoc road turns inland just after it passes Lafite, and the vineyards of St.-Estephe, specifically Cos d'Estournel, come up on the left. Cos is beyond our reach here, but St.-Estephe is not without its $30-and-under charms. Chateaux Meyney, Les-Ormes-de-Pez and Phelan-Segur range from about $25 to about $30.</p>
        <p>Meyney at times can be rough and tannic. Not so this wine. Like many St.-Estephes, it has a rough edge, but it is mostly supple and rounded, with plenty of body and fruit and a long finish. Les-Ormes-de-Pez is owned by Jean-Michel Cazes and his family, and its wines regularly display qualities of their Lynch-Bages.</p>
        <p>As for Phelan-Segur, I liked it before the Gardinier family bought it from the Delons in 1986, and I've watch it improve steadily. The 1997 is solid, well made, with a lovely bouquet. It is less concentrated than it might be and shows a bit of typical St.-Estephe muscle, but it's worthy.</p>
        <p>Having mentioned Fronsac and Canon-Fronsac, I'm obliged to suggest a wine from there. I particularly liked Chateau Canon Moueix, a minor star in the Moueix family's collection of chateaus. The wine displays the familiar 1997 softness, but there is richness and some succulent fruit as well. It's about $20.</p>
        <p>I've never been much of a fan of half-bottles, but if you like the idea, there are plenty around. Certainly, they're a way to move up in quality. Among the 1997 Bordeaux in half-bottles hovering around $25 are Grand-Puy-Lacoste, Leoville-Barton and Leoville-Poyferre. Calon-Segur is about $15, Brainaire-Ducru $20 and Lafon-Rochet $15.</p>
        <p>Should you choose to go right to the top, in half-bottles, of course, Haut-Brion and Lafite are both around $72; Chateau Margaux is $110 and Mouton-Rothschild $129.</p>
        <p>They say good things come in small packages. O.K., but I'd prefer a Lynch-Bages at around $50 to any of these pint-size heavy hitters.</p>
