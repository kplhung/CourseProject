        <p>A Chinese spokesman attacked Taiwan's president today for suggesting that his island's unification with China is not inevitable, calling the remarks ''very dangerous.''</p>
        <p>The spokesman also indicated in a news conference that China's patience with the president, Chen Shui-bian, since he took office in May is beginning to wear thin.</p>
        <p>''Viewing his first 100 days, we think he is not moving toward accepting the one-China principle and is instead moving in the direction of Taiwan separatism,'' said Zhang Mingqing, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Zhang did not indicate that Beijing was taking any new steps to threaten Taiwan, which it considers a part of China that was separated by civil war and must some day return.</p>
        <p>China was deeply concerned about Mr. Chen's election because his Democratic Progressive Party has long advocated Taiwan's formal independence. But before and after his election, Mr. Chen eased tensions by making clear that he would not declare independence unless China attacked Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Since taking office, Mr. Chen has sought to differentiate his position as national leader from that of his party and, in a gesture of friendship toward China, has offered to discuss closer economic ties.</p>
        <p>The Chinese government continues to shun discussions with Mr. Chen's party, the Democratic Progressive Party, and today the spokesman in Beijing said, ''We will not have any contact with the D.P.P. until it revises its pro-independence platform.''</p>
