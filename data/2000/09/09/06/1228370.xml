        <p>The United Nations Millennium Summit this week brings to New York City the largest gathering ever of world leaders to address the most serious of global afflictions. It is an occasion calling for hope and perseverance, but most New Yorkers cannot get past the ominous numbers: 91 scheduled protests, at least 175 motorcades, 245 dignitaries requiring Secret Service and police protection, and 3 days of President Clinton stopping traffic in Manhattan. It is no wonder many residents welcome the meeting with the same grousing accorded the West Nile virus, the Atlanta Braves or a ride on the No. 4 subway line.</p>

        <p>The United Nations Millennium Summit this week brings to New York City the largest gathering ever of world leaders to address the most serious of global afflictions. It is an occasion calling for hope and perseverance, but most New Yorkers cannot get past the ominous numbers: 91 scheduled protests, at least 175 motorcades, 245 dignitaries requiring Secret Service and police protection, and 3 days of President Clinton stopping traffic in Manhattan. It is no wonder many residents welcome the meeting with the same grousing accorded the West Nile virus, the Atlanta Braves or a ride on the No. 4 subway line.</p>
        <p>If the United Nations were headquartered in Tulsa or Des Moines, people might line the streets to greet the caravans ferrying foreign leaders with homemade signs wishing them well in their fight against illiteracy, AIDS and poverty. Kids would offer the delegates fresh lemonade, and signs at local high school football stadiums would read ''Bobcats for Globalization!'' or ''Go Kofi!''</p>
        <p>But not in New York. Though the city gains cachet and, by its own estimate, more than $3 billion a year in economic activity from housing the U.N., New Yorkers feel no compulsion to be grateful, or to pay a price, for the honor of being designated as the world's capital. More than a few residents think New York adds more to the U.N. than the world organization adds to New York.</p>
        <p>But imagine the city without a United Nations. The constant stream of foreign leaders convening in New York, and their permanent representatives there, help to transform the city from mere financial center to world capital. Images of Nikita Khrushchev pounding the desk with his shoe and of countless other world leaders from Fidel Castro to Nelson Mandela addressing the General Assembly are an indelible part of the city's history. In contrast to some cases of town-gown friction, New York's U.N. campus is a fitting mirror of the city's own history as a mixing point of cultures and aspirations. It is as much a monument to New York's heritage as Ellis Island is.</p>
        <p>Though New York is the perfect home for the United Nations, it did not have a lock on being chosen. Certainly if the U.N. were created today, it would more likely be based in Geneva or The Hague.  Only in the immediate aftermath of World War II could a majority of nations have accepted the notion of the world's diplomatic forum being established in the United States.</p>
        <p>Even among American cities, New York was not the initial front-runner for the U.N.'s permanent home. The American foreign-policy elite considered San Francisco, site of the organization's founding convention in 1945, the most desirable candidate, providing a more idyllic setting and a less Euro-centric perspective than New York or Washington. Though the U.N. had made New York its temporary home in the fall of 1946, Boston and Philadelphia were deemed stronger East Coast contenders.</p>
        <p>To his credit, New York City's mayor at the time, William O'Dwyer, felt that getting the U.N. to stay for good was ''the one great thing that would make New York the center of the world,'' but he had little to offer in the way of choice real estate or cash.</p>
        <p>The solution came from Robert Moses, William Zeckendorf and Nelson Rockefeller. The three New Yorkers worked frantically in the week before the U.N.'s final headquarters decision, in December 1946, to cobble together a deal whereby John D. Rockefeller Jr., Nelson's father, would pay Mr. Zeckendorf $8.5 million for a plot of land on once-blighted Turtle Bay on Midtown Manhattan's East Side and the Rockefellers would then turn it over to the U.N. Mr. Moses, the longtime public servant who headed a blue-ribbon committee to keep the U.N. in New York, was able to secure some other goodies from the city and state. The rest, as they say, is Midtown congestion, and a shining spot in the diplomatic firmament.</p>
