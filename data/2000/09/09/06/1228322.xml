        <p>Democrats took the offensive today and said they would remain on Capitol Hill as long as necessary this year to push their agenda, from overhauling managed care to bumping up the minimum wage.</p>

        <p>Democrats took the offensive today and said they would remain on Capitol Hill as long as necessary this year to push their agenda, from overhauling managed care to bumping up the minimum wage.</p>
        <p>''Not only are we going to hold the bar high enough, we're also going to ensure that we have the time it takes to address these issues,'' Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, warned shortly after a meeting with President Clinton at the White House. ''And we're in no hurry to go anywhere.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, Senate Republican leaders were drawing their own line in the sand, saying they would not approve a rise in the minimum wage without accompanying tax cuts for small businesses and assuring that a Democratic bill to overhaul managed health care would go nowhere.</p>
        <p>And in a turnaround, Senate Republican leaders also pushed a revised bill on prescription drugs, written by Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, that had gained little traction in July, a sign both of the issue's potency among voters and of perceptions that Mr. Roth is vulnerable in his campaign for re-election. The legislation would immediately make drugs more affordable for the low-income elderly, independently of Medicare.</p>
        <p>Democrats propose a measure to help all of the elderly pay some of the costs of prescription drug coverage. House Republicans have already passed their own separate bill.</p>
        <p>''We want to do it in such a way that it doesn't cause major problems for Medicare,'' said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. ''The president wants to subsidize it for everybody. And he wants to do it, and Al Gore wants to do it, without any Medicare changes. That is a major problem. That's like putting more passengers on the Titanic as it's headed down.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton, Mr. Daschle, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the minority leader, and other Democrats met today at the White House to discuss strategy for closing out the Congressional session before the November election. Congress is officially scheduled to break on Oct. 6, a target date that is likely to come and go.</p>
        <p>For now, the strategy appears simple: Push the Democratic agenda, criticize Republican tax cuts as too expensive and hold the Republicans' feet to the fire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle said Democrats were unlikely to embrace Mr. Roth's prescription drug bill. ''We are unwilling to accept a bill that does not meet at least the minimum criteria,'' he said. ''We've said it had to be universal.''</p>
        <p>And he said he would push for another vote on a bill to overhaul managed care that Democrats favor and that has already passed the House. The bill could pass the Senate this time around, with the arrival of Senator Zell Miller, a Georgia Democrat who replaced the late Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican.</p>
        <p>As for minimum wage, Mr. Daschle expressed reservations today about a Republican proposal to include tax breaks for small businesses, which he said totaled $76 billion.</p>
        <p>Republicans in the Senate said they were ready to do battle, if necessary, and shot back at Democrats today.</p>
        <p>''Every time an appropriations bill comes up, just about, we have 100 amendments,'' Mr. Lott said. ''You know it's a magic number -- 100.''</p>
        <p>''I'm concerned, he added, ''that the White House wants to create a mess at the end of the session for pure political reasons.''</p>
