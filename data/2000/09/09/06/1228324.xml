        <p>Latest U.F.T. Bid for Higher Pay</p>
        <p>In its latest attempt to prove that New York City teachers need fatter paychecks, the United Federation of Teachers has released a survey suggesting that most young people have no interest in a teaching career.</p>
        <p>Of the 300 high school and college students surveyed, only 25 percent said teaching was an appealing option. Of those willing to consider teaching in the metropolitan region, 19 percent said New York City public schools would be their first choice.</p>
        <p>RANDI WEINGARTEN, president of the union, will likely use the results as ammunition in the negotiations that start today for a new teachers' contract.</p>
        <p>But getting higher salaries will not be easy. MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI said yesterday that he would seek more productivity. The mayor will also insist on a merit pay program, something the union strongly opposes.</p>
        <p>2 Colleges Plan High-Tech Learning Center</p>
        <p>In an unusual collaboration, a private college and a public college are teaming up on a high-technology learning center that both will use. DAVID J. STEINBERG, president of Long Island University, and BILL LACY, president of Purchase College at the State University of New York, last week marked the start of construction on the center on Purchase's campus in Westchester. L.I.U. is putting up the money for the $2.7 million building, which will contain two computer labs and 14 classrooms wired for computers. Purchase College will use the center for training and continuing education during the day; L.I.U. graduate school students will occupy it at night.</p>
        <p>CUNY Library to House Durst Materials</p>
        <p>SEYMOUR B. DURST, the real estate developer, started collecting historical materials on New York City in 1960. By the time he died in 1995, they filled his five-story town house. Tomorrow, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York will dedicate a library and reading room in his name to house some of those materials, which include some 9,000 books, 3,000 photos, 20,000 postcards, and other items spanning four centuries. KENNETH T. JACKSON, the Columbia University historian and author of ''The Encyclopedia of New York City,'' will speak at the dedication.</p>
        <p>More Studies Planned for Mars Project</p>
        <p>When NASA decided earlier this year to cancel its next landing on Mars, scheduled for 2001, STEVEN SQUYRES was a man with some very expensive instruments designed to explore Mars and no way of getting them there. But Dr. Squyres, a Cornell University astronomy professor who was responsible for designing the scientific payload for the Mars mission, got some better news in August when NASA decided to schedule not one but two Mars launchings in 2003. Once the 2001 launch was called off, he knew that it would take at least two years before another could be scheduled. Opportunities to launch to Mars come only every 26 months, when the planets are correctly lined up.</p>
        <p>While Dr. Squyres waits, he will oversee the construction of a second set of instruments to study the planet's climate and search for water (past or present). He will also draw about a dozen undergraduates into the Mars project.</p>
        <p>Polytechnic Focus on Wireless Computers</p>
        <p>Polytechnic University in Brooklyn has become both all wired and all wireless.</p>
        <p>Starting this semester, all 475 freshmen have been issued an I.B.M. laptop computer. Over four years, the curriculum will be made compatible with the computers, which will be leased to students in each succeeding class for $500 a semester. Students can use their computers to access the Internet in three ways: by plugging them into a high-speed jack at wired campus buildings, by using a wireless function inside the buildings or  by dialing through a modem off-campus.</p>
        <p>Polytechnic officials say it is one of the few universities to use wireless computers so widely on campus.</p>
