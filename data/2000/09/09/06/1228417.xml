        <p>The police said the black teenagers were part of a group of 10 young men who surrounded six white teenagers in West Brighton at 8 p.m. Monday and shouted profanity-laced, antiwhite remarks.

        <p>In an attack that the authorities described as a hate crime, three black Staten Island teenagers were charged with assault and robbery yesterday in an attack on a group of white teenagers.</p>
        <p>The police said the black teenagers were part of a group of 10 young men who surrounded six white teenagers in West Brighton at 8 p.m. Monday and shouted profanity-laced, antiwhite remarks. The taunting descended into violence, the police said, when three black teenagers began to punch three of the white youths.</p>
        <p>''The motivating factor behind the attacks was that the victims were white,'' one investigator said. ''They said they had a problem with white people being in their neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>The attacks occurred near the intersection of Post Avenue and Clove Road, the police said.</p>
        <p>One of the attackers was wearing brass knuckles, the police said. One victim, a 14-year-old boy, had a concussion, and another had extensive cuts on his face. The attackers robbed the victims of a silver bracelet, a MetroCard, a personal stereo and $16 in cash, the police said.</p>
        <p>Two of the teenagers -- Anthony McCoy, 17, and his brother Peter McCoy, 16, both of 45 Holland Avenue -- were charged as adults with multiple counts of second-degree assault and aggravated harassment. A third teenager, 14, faces the same counts but his name is being withheld because he was charged as a juvenile.</p>
        <p>All three were also charged with robbery.</p>
