        <p>HIRSCH-Steven J., 105. Died in San Francisco, September 2nd. Mr. Hirsch was born in New York City, January 25, 1895 and was a resident of New York for 101 years before moving to San Francisco to be with his family. He is survived by two daughters and their husbands, Barbara and John Rosston and Dorothy and James Loebl, as well as five grandchildren, Steven and Gregory Rosston, Jeffrey Loebl, Susan Grasso, and Ellen Loebl, and seven great-grandchildren. He was a member of Princeton University's Class of 1917 and became the oldest living alumnus of the University. He served in both World War I and World War II and left the service as a Lieutenant Colonel. For his service in France in World War I, the French government recently awarded him the Legion of Honor. During his long life, he worked in investment management and was an ardent opera enthusiast and golfer. He was devoted to his family, friends and in recent years his caregivers. Mr. Hirsch's wife Dorothy Bloch, the love of his life, died in 1964. Services are private. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in his memory to The Steven J. Hirsch '17 Scholarship fund at Princeton University, Office of the Recording Secretary, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, or a charity of choice.</p>
