        <p>As failing schools in New York City and State have increasingly turned to costly prepackaged school improvement programs as an answer to their shortcomings, local school officials have failed to evaluate how well those programs work, according to an audit released yesterday by the state comptroller.</p>
        <p>While the city and state have studied the programs in schools where they have been adopted, officials have focused on how well the programs are carried out rather than whether they improve the achievement of students, the report said.</p>

        <p>As failing schools in New York City and State have increasingly turned to costly prepackaged school improvement programs as an answer to their shortcomings, local school officials have failed to evaluate how well those programs work, according to an audit released yesterday by the state comptroller.</p>
        <p>While the city and state have studied the programs in schools where they have been adopted, officials have focused on how well the programs are carried out rather than whether they improve the achievement of students, the report said.</p>
        <p>''These programs cost more than $9 million'' from 1996 to 1998, said H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller. ''But nobody can say for certain if they actually work.''</p>
        <p>As part of his audit, Mr. McCall surveyed 11 schools where sixth-grade reading scores had improved by at least 20 percent. The audit found that six had used an improvement program -- like Success for All, the reading program used in many New York City schools -- and five had not.</p>
        <p>''Moreover,'' the report said, ''we were consistently told that the improvement in reading was the result of the staff's extra effort rather than any special program. Therefore, some schools may be able to improve their performance without the help of costly prepackaged improvement programs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall also criticized the New York City Board of Education for hiring the same consultants who developed school improvement programs to evaluate their effectiveness. For example, Johns Hopkins University got a contract to review  the Success for All program, which it developed, and the review did not include an analysis of the students' performance on state standardized tests. Another consultant, Lightspan Partnership, also evaluated programs it had developed.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Rizzo, deputy chancellor for instruction of New York City schools, disputed the findings of the audit, saying that it was not appropriate to try to attribute gains in student test scores to any one factor, like a school improvement program.</p>
        <p>State education officials agreed with the audit on most counts and noted that the state was developing a new computer database that would identify and track the academic performance of each student statewide.</p>
