        <p>If the 150 or so national leaders assembled at the United Nations yesterday were curious about where globalization was really taking the world, they could have ambled over to Town Hall, the concert auditorium on West 43rd Street.</p>
        <p>There, opinions abounded:</p>
        <p>''The current stage of the world economy is the cancer stage.''</p>
        <p>''We should continue in cutting back the powers of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.''</p>
        <p>''What is the global economy doing to the Earth? It's killing it.''</p>
        <p>The remarks came during a teach-in organized by the International Forum on Globalization, a group based in Northern California that opposes the spread of an unregulated free-market economy.</p>
        <p>More than 900 people came to hear about the evils of American- and European-dominated financial institutions like the World Bank, the I.M.F. and the World Trade Organization. Issues mentioned in the forum, ''Globalization and the Role of the United Nations,'' ranged from dam building in the Philippines to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement on the world monetary system.</p>
        <p>Many involved had taken part in the protests in November that tied up a meeting of the World Trade Organization in Seattle. In April, many of the same people, who represent causes ranging from environmental protection to the needs of indigenous cultures, took to the streets of Washington during a meeting of the World Bank and I.M.F.</p>
        <p>But there were no black masks or tear gas in evidence yesterday, and the attendees appeared as well mannered as their counterparts in the United Nations complex overlooking the East River. An usher took tickets ($20 for general admission) and organizers handed out sheets the audience could use to rate panels (poor to excellent in various categories).</p>
        <p>Relative calm prevailed partly because the teach-in was intended to be a discussion, not a demonstration, and partly because many attending were not ready to write off the United Nations as an unwitting tool of American corporations.</p>
        <p>''The United Nations has traditionally had a mandate of social justice and peace and human rights,'' said Jerry Mander, founder of the forum. ''But we've lately begun to worry that that mandate was weakening, and that the same ideologies that drive the W.T.O. will appear in the United Nations.''</p>
        <p>For the anti-globalization movement, the teach-in was not only a place to assess the role of the United Nations but also allowed participants to reflect on how far the movement had come since Seattle, and how much farther it had to go.</p>
        <p>Many speakers said they did not oppose globalization per se because, in their view, the era of nation-states is coming to its inevitable end. But they oppose an emerging world economy where global policies are made by large corporations. Those policies, the speakers said, are paving the way for big business to exploit developing countries.</p>
        <p>''We have entered the era of corporate rule,'' Mr. Mander said to the audience. ''The familiar homily is this: The rising tide will lift all boats. Actually, it lifts yachts.''</p>
        <p>The four speakers on a panel introduced by Mr. Mander congratulated the movement for making its roar heard during the Seattle protests, but also rattled off a list of goals and strategies. Several panelists said economic boycotts would be the most effective way to get their message across to business executives.</p>
        <p>Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, an advocate for indigenous people in the Philippines, implored listeners to urge the United Nations to adhere to its original goals. ''More and more, we are seeing that the United Nations is abdicating its role in terms of social improvement, in terms of poverty alleviation,'' she said. ''It is our role to still insist and assert that the United Nations is not a body that should be siding with the interests of capitalists or the interests of powerful corporations.''</p>
        <p>In some ways, the speeches at Town Hall echoed the goals of this week's summit meeting at the United Nations. The meeting there is intended as a forum where the voices of the smallest countries can be heard alongside those of the most powerful.</p>
        <p>Hours before the teach-in began, President Muhammad Khatami of Iran said in his speech at the United Nations, ''Global culture cannot and should not overlook the characteristics and requirements of local cultures with the aim of imposing itself on them.''</p>
        <p>And yesterday afternoon, a Matthew Garrington, 23, who grew up in Olympia, Wash., a world away from the Middle East, picked up several brochures on a table outside the teach-in and said, ''Obviously globalization is going to happen, and I want to make sure it happens responsibly.''</p>
