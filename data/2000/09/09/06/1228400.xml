        <p>The key, Todd Zeile said this afternoon, is to realize you will come out of it eventually. Don't lose confidence. Don't change the mechanics of your swing. Don't panic. The hits have come before, said the Mets' first baseman, and they will come again.</p>
        <p>The Mets are in an offensive free-fall, and Zeile has been one of the fastest to plummet. But if the Mets' four-game losing streak to start September stirred memories of past stretch-drive failures, Zeile is oblivious. He is in his first season with the Mets.</p>
        <p>''Everyone's thinking, who's going to make the big pitch or the big play,'' Zeile said, after delivering a game-winning home run in the 10th inning to lift the Mets to a 3-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. ''When the team collectively struggles, at times you can collectively press. But one of the strengths of this team is the fact that so many guys have so much experience that I don't think it'll ever become a landslide type of situation.''</p>
        <p>Zeile, who was batting .146 since Aug. 17 before tonight, had two hits, including a two-out single that drove in the Mets' first run. His homer came with one out, on a 3-1 fastball from Scott Sullivan (2-6). It gave the Mets the margin of victory in a close, low-scoring, well-pitched game -- the usual recipe.</p>
        <p>''Those are the kinds of wins that we had at home before we went on the road,'' Zeile said. ''We weren't knocking anybody down, definitely. It was key hits here and there, solid defense and great pitching, which was kind of an indication of what happened here tonight.''</p>
        <p>The Mets built a 2-0 lead after four innings but let the Reds tie the game on a single by Chris Stynes in the seventh. Cincinnati nearly won in the ninth, when Ken Griffey Jr. pulled a high fastball from Turk Wendell a few feet foul down the right field line.</p>
        <p>Wendell, who was an eight-year-old New England kid when the Boston Red Sox' Carlton Fisk famously waved his home run fair in the 1975 World Series, waved Griffey's smash foul.</p>
        <p>A desperate act, but Wendell was a desperate man -- the Mets had lost all three games in St. Louis last weekend on the last pitch, and Wendell did not want to do so again.</p>
        <p>''I dropped the Carlton Fisk on 'em,'' Wendell said. ''I'm sure a lot of guys were thinking, 'Oh, geez, I don't want to walk off the field again.' It's just nice to get rid of the skid that we're on.''</p>
        <p>Armando Benitez followed Wendell with a 1-2-3 10th for his 37th save, and the Mets won for the eighth time in Rick Reed's last 10 starts.</p>
        <p>With the victory, the Mets increased their lead in the National League wild-card race to five games over the Arizona Diamondbacks, who lost in Atlanta. The Mets trail the Braves by one game in the N.L. East.</p>
        <p>The most pertinent return was that of the setup man John Franco, who missed two weeks with a sore left pectoral muscle. Franco worked one and a third scoreless innings, and though he felt some discomfort in the muscle near the end of his outing, team trainers told him that was only natural.</p>
        <p>''After two weeks off, I probably just overworked it a little bit, just trying to be perfect,'' Franco said.</p>
        <p>Reed left with a throbbing sensation in his right forearm that is not considered serious. He avoided trouble with fine defense and one Reds base-running blunder. Dmitri Young led off the second with a single, and third baseman Robin Ventura charged a Michael Tucker grounder and threw him out at first. Young got to second on the play, and Chris Sexton singled to right.</p>
        <p>Young chugged to third and was waved home by the third-base coach, Ron Oester.</p>
        <p>Timoniel Perez did not make an especially accurate throw -- it was several feet up the line -- but Young was even further away from the plate. Catcher Mike Piazza tagged him for the out, and the inning ended one batter later.</p>
        <p>Reed held the Reds hitless until the fifth, when Sexton led off with a double. Jason LaRue followed with a shot down the third base line, but Ventura leaped to his right for a diving catch. Pokey Reese singled in Sexton with two outs, but the damage could have been worse had Ventura not prevented an extra-base hit.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The antibiotics Mets outfielder DEREK BELL took on Monday worked wonders on his bruised left knee. Bell, who developed an infection in the knee that led to a groin injury, said the swelling in his knee is greatly reduced. He missed five games but returned as a defensive replacement tonight.</p>
