        <p>A federal judge in Manhattan refused yesterday to dismiss a legal challenge to New York State's laws barring the direct shipment of wine  from out-of-state wineries.</p>
        <p>Although the state's ban on interstate wine sales was found constitutional 30 years ago, Judge Richard M. Berman of United States District Court cited the evolution of both law and technology, including the advent of sales on the Internet, as a basis for re-examining the issue.</p>
        <p>''Technological advancements facilitate -- as never before -- the commerce between and among states,'' the judge wrote. ''The Internet increasingly is responsible for direct sale and shipment of goods to consumers.''</p>
        <p>The judge noted that the United States Supreme Court had held that the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition and allowed states to regulate liquor sales, was not intended ''to empower states to favor local liquor industries by erecting barriers'' to competition.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, one of several around the country challenging state bans on interstate wine sales, has been seen as a national test case in part because New York is the second biggest wine market in the country after California and is also a major wine producer.</p>
        <p>Judge Berman's ruling was preliminary. No legal discovery has taken place in the case, and the judge did not address the merits of the suit. And for purposes of making his ruling, Judge Berman said he was ''constrained to assume'' that the plaintiff's allegations were true -- that the New York law is economic protectionism.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed by two wineries in Virginia and California and three consumers in New York, says that the ban on interstate shipments violates the commerce clause of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of commerce. The suit also contends that the law violates the First Amendment, in banning advertising that solicits such sales.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs are represented by a libertarian legal advocacy group in Washington, the Institute for Justice, whose litigation director, Clint Bolick, called the ruling a victory for consumers and small wineries.</p>
        <p>''It's David 1, Goliath 0,'' Mr. Bolick said.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for New York State and members of its liquor industry retailers and wholesalers, union workers and a prominent religious figure who argued that the law promotes temperance expressed confidence yesterday that the law would not be overturned.</p>
        <p>They argue that the Supreme Court has held that the 21st Amendment gives states wide latitude in regulating interstate sales of liquor. They also cited the preliminary nature of yesterday's ruling, which allows the case to proceed to discovery and trial.</p>
        <p>Two lawyers who argued on behalf of the defendants said in a statement that New York had ''good reasons'' for its ban: ''to ensure accountability and responsibility, to promote temperance, to provide orderly market conditions and to collect taxes.''</p>
        <p>''Those are legitimate state interests that our Constitution protects,'' said the lawyers, Randy M. Mastro and Howard Graff. The Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, the pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem,  also filed legal papers defending the law, saying its overturning would have ''devastating consequences.''</p>
        <p>''Minors will be able to order alcohol from out-of-state suppliers at the click of a mouse on the Internet or over the telephone,'' Mr. Butts said in the court papers. He did not return a telephone call seeking comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>One of the plaintiffs, Juanita G. Swedenburg, the co-owner of a small family winery in Middleburg, Va., said she was delighted with the ruling. She said tourists from New York and other states who visited her vineyard often asked her to ship bottles of wine to their homes.</p>
        <p>''And the public cannot figure out why it's illegal,'' she said, ''when they call me and say, 'I love that chardonnay and send me a case.' And I say, 'I can't do that.' ''</p>
