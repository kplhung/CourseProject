        <p>In the early 1990's, the United States Postal Service had an employee crisis on its hands. Not the workplace shootings that made headlines and added the phrase ''going postal'' to the American vocabulary of violence. Those incidents, while often deadly, were isolated.</p>
        <p>What really threatened the agency's productivity and morale was an avalanche of complaints by angry, frustrated employees to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. For years, charges of racial discrimination, sexual harassment and other management abuses poured into the watchdog agency from the Postal Service, and the volume of informal complaints had built up to an incredible 30,000 filings a year, more than from any other single employer. Some of the complaints escalated into costly litigation, while others festered.</p>
        <p>But in 1994 as part of a settlement of a class-action lawsuit, lawyers at the Postal Service, one of the nation's largest employers, started one of the most ambitious experiments in dispute resolution in American corporate history. They created a program called Redress to settle disputes using neutral outside mediators, and tested it in a few cities before rolling it out nationally in 1997.</p>
        <p>The results were spectacular: in the first 22 months of full operation, from September 1998 through June of this year, 17,645 informal disputes were mediated under Redress and of those, 80 percent were resolved.</p>
        <p>During the same period, formal complaints, which peaked at 14,000 by 1997, dropped 30 percent. The lawyers estimate that the program has saved the agency millions of dollars in legal costs and improved productivity, to say nothing of the gains in intangibles like job satisfaction.</p>
        <p>Now, two of the Postal Service's lawyers, Cynthia J. Hallberlin, former chief counsel, and Mary S. Elcano, former general counsel, have left for private practice at the Brown &amp; Wood law firm in Washington, and are taking a similar program, which they have named Wins, on a road show. They are convinced that if mediation worked wonders for the Postal Service, it could do so at any company or organization.</p>
        <p>Already, the World Bank has signed on for a review of its mediation program, and others, including investment banks, dot-coms and recognized brand-name manufacturers, are interested, the lawyers say. What is selling them, they say, is Redress's record.</p>
        <p>Corporate America certainly needs the help. High-profile racial discrimination and sexual-harassment class-action lawsuits filed in recent years against industry giants like Texaco and Coca-Cola are only the tip of the litigation iceberg. Employment discrimination cases nearly tripled between 1990 and 1998, to 23,735 filings in federal district courts, according to the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>To be sure, companies are not sitting on their hands. A survey of Fortune 1,000 companies in 1997 by the Cornell Institute on Conflict Resolution found that the majority were doing some form of what is known as alternative dispute resolution to avoid litigation.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Elcano and Ms. Hallberlin say they possess one thing that no one else can offer, a huge database of statistics and exit surveys, which they say proves how valuable their form of mediation, called transformative mediation, was to postal workers.</p>
        <p>In it, the parties involved control the process and the outcome.</p>
        <p>''We have found that companies are very interested in transformative mediation,'' Ms. Hallberlin said, ''because of its promise to not just solve the problem at hand, but to help the parties communicate more effectively in the future.''</p>
        <p>Before Redress was created, Postal Service employees embroiled in disputes with their bosses followed procedures that could drag on for years. Generally, they would begin by filing an informal E.E.O.C. complaint. They then had the choice of dropping the matter or going down the bureaucratic path of filing a formal grievance, starting an official investigation with all its affidavits and hearings. Ultimately, they might file a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The Redress program aimed to short-circuit that process by offering disgruntled workers mediation. If a person who filed an informal complaint agreed, a meeting would be set up, a mediator would hear both sides of the dispute and, in most instances, help propose a solution within a day.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, all the worker wanted was for his boss to say he was sorry. ''The power of an apology became very significant,'' Ms. Elcano said. ''People would walk away from litigation with that because they felt it was an honest give and take.''</p>
        <p>For example, one supervisor called all of his mail carriers by a number, Ms. Hallberlin said. One carrier thought it was demeaning and filed a complaint. When confronted about it in mediation, the supervisor said he had had no idea that some people found the practice offensive and said he would stop it immediately. Case closed.</p>
        <p>''You're never going to get rid of conflict,'' Ms. Hallberlin said, ''you just want to handle it better.''</p>
        <p>Robert A. Baruch Bush, a law professor at Hofstra University who helped design a training program for the 3,000 outside mediators in Redress, said the goal was to shift conversations between employees and their supervisors from destructive to constructive. ''If that happens,'' he said, ''it becomes a more open corporation, and then the parties themselves in most cases will be able to define what's bothering them and how to fix it.'' Resolution is a byproduct, he added.</p>
        <p>Redress is intended to make mediation available at any stage of the grievance process, not just at the beginning. In one class-action racial-discrimination lawsuit that had originated in an E.E.O.C. complaint, black postal workers in Florida accused a white postmaster of making racist remarks about their work habits. They sought his dismissal, Ms. Hallberlin said.</p>
        <p>It never came to that or to a dollar settlement, she said, because both parties agreed to bring in an outside mediator. In the end, the postmaster apologized, wrote a check to the N.A.A.C.P. and joined the Postal Service's diversity committee. ''In future dealings, he had a more harmonious post office,'' Ms. Hallberlin said.</p>
        <p>Elaine Kirsch, an outside mediator working in New York, recalled a case involving a postal supervisor and an employee, both women, one white and one black, neither willing to back down. The dispute was over the employee's repeated lateness, Ms. Kirsch said, but really it was about a lack of communication. After yelling at each other for one and a half hours, she said, the two became quiet.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kirsch said she took the opportunity to point out that the two had more in common than they had thought. Sometime after that, she said, the supervisor and employee returned to hammering out particular issues and rehashing events. Finally, one said words to this effect: ''You never lied. You always say what you mean.''</p>
        <p>The ice was broken, Ms. Kirsch said, ''and from then on it was easy as pie.'' It turned out that the employee was often late because she had trouble finding care for her asthmatic child. She agreed to call her supervisor when this happened and her supervisor agreed to be more understanding.</p>
        <p>To keep tabs on Redress's progress, the Postal Service hired Lisa Bingham, director of the Conflict Resolution Center at Indiana University. ''Quantifying has been one of the problems with the field of dispute resolution for some time,'' Ms. Bingham said.</p>
        <p>Her exit-survey research showed that postal employees and their union representatives and supervisors were highly satisfied with the process and the mediators. And, to a lesser degree, the parties were satisfied with the outcome.</p>
        <p>Mary P. Rowe, an adjunct professor at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T., said Redress ''was large, elaborate and better evaluated than virtually any other component or system like it.''</p>
        <p>And, said Professor Rowe, a longtime ombudsperson at M.I.T., there was no reason that programs like Redress should not thrive in the private sector. ''Conflict management programs should function in every milieu,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is a big fan of mediation, of course, least of all the plaintiffs' bar. ''Damages are often the best way to make up for how someone has been harmed,'' said Pamela Coukos, a lawyer for Mehri, Malkin &amp; Ross, the Washington firm handling the class-action lawsuit against Coca-Cola. ''Money can be a measure of how much respect you are given by a company.'' At the very least, Ms. Coukos said, workers with grievances should have a choice between litigation or some type of nonjudicial dispute resolution.</p>
        <p>And in fact, such dispute resolution is widespread. Of the 606 companies surveyed by Cornell, for example, 88 percent reported using mediation at least once in the preceding three years and 79 percent reported using arbitration, which like mediation employs outside neutral parties, but unlike mediation, reaches a binding solution.</p>
        <p>Today, said David B. Lipsky, the Cornell professor who conducted the 1997 survey with Ronald L. Seeber, companies are moving from a piecemeal approach to unified programs.</p>
        <p>A little more than a year ago, for example, the Prudential Insurance Company of America in Newark, started its own program called Roads to Resolution. Oliver B. Quinn, the program director, said Prudential took the step to develop a system that offered mediation and arbitration in light of the litigation erupting elsewhere.</p>
        <p>And as part of its settlement of a multimillion-dollar racial discrimination case, Texaco created an Ombuds Program in February 1998. Later that year, the company folded it and other programs like mediation and arbitration into a problem-resolution system.</p>
        <p>As a result, Carole A. Young, director of the Ombuds program, said a court-appointed task force had determined that litigation had been reduced by nearly half in the first year.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the good news continues for the Postal Service. Karen Intrater, one of the lawyers who came up with the idea of Redress, said the program had been so successful it was catching on among government agencies.</p>
        <p>''It's not a magic pill, but you can see the difference,'' Ms. Intrater said. ''I've never seen anything that has such a potential for change as this.''</p>
