        <p>The Food Network is unveiling six new shows this season. Two were not available for preview: a dessert show called ''Sweet Dreams,'' scheduled for next month, and one yet unnamed starring Wolfgang Puck, to have its premiere in January. I watched episodes of the other four. All times are Eastern.</p>

        <p>The Food Network is unveiling six new shows this season. Two were not available for preview: a dessert show called ''Sweet Dreams,'' scheduled for next month, and one yet unnamed starring Wolfgang Puck, to have its premiere in January. I watched episodes of the other four. All times are Eastern.</p>
        <p>B. SMITH WITH STYLE -- Weekdays at noon.</p>
        <p>Barbara Smith, the lifestyle guru and owner of B. Smith's restaurant in the theater district, is the host of a show on entertaining and cooking. Watch if you want to know whether dry shampoos are an option for braided hair that comes loose in water. Don't watch if you want to grill a chicken; Bobby Flay, a guest, promised it would take only 14 minutes to cook. Mine was still pink after 35.</p>
        <p>MELTING POT -- Weekdays at 3:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>A rotating group of five sets of chefs explore various ethnic cuisines. I watched Aaron Sanchez, the former chef at Isla in Greenwich Village, and Alex Garcia, executive chef at Calle Ocho on the Upper West Side, prepare a Latino cocktail party. The menu included white anchovy salad, habanero-marinated shrimp and yucca fritters. Mr. Garcia confided, ''I love to be a guest at my own party.'' Maybe that explains all the dancing in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>MING'S QUEST -- Thursdays at 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.</p>
        <p>Ming Tsai, the star of ''East Meets West With Ming Tsai,'' demonstrates his athleticism as well as his chopping skills as he farms ostriches in Texas or dives for lobster in Massachusetts, then cooks his catch. The lobster, for example, was grilled with garlic and black pepper, with the sea in the background and the wind ruffling his bangs.</p>
        <p>NAKED CHEF -- Preview on Oct. 29 at 10 p.m.; premiere on Nov. 4 at 9:30 p.m.; it will then be shown on Saturdays at 9:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>The winsome Jamie Oliver is the latest cooking sensation from the BBC. We see him shop for food, and for clothes. His parties are casual, and so are his cooking techniques: for instance, to avoid a spatter of lime juice and garlic from a monster-size mortar and pestle, he drapes a plastic grocery bag over the top of the bowl.</p>
