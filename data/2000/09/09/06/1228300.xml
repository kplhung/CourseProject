        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Clinton's decision to put off deployment of a national missile defense system (front page, Sept. 2) is good news for arms control advocates. After all, the only thing a missile defense system is likely to destroy is the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, a cornerstone of nuclear nonproliferation since President Nixon was in the White House.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Clinton's decision to put off deployment of a national missile defense system (front page, Sept. 2) is good news for arms control advocates. After all, the only thing a missile defense system is likely to destroy is the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, a cornerstone of nuclear nonproliferation since President Nixon was in the White House.</p>
        <p>Perhaps now the focus can turn to the real arms threat: the thousands of American and Russian nuclear weapons still on hair-trigger alert.</p>
        <p>In a time of crisis or perceived attack, decision makers on both sides have just minutes to decide whether to launch a nuclear strike. The security of the United States and the world rests with deteriorating Russian nuclear command and early warning systems.</p>
        <p>The recent Russian submarine tragedy reminds us that we are just an accident away from nuclear war, but the message has yet to reach our leaders.</p>
