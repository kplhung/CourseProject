        <p>For the next week, and perhaps a few days more, Bernie Williams's life at the ballpark will consist of heating pads and other medical treatment. Williams again aggravated a strain on the right side of his rib cage while swinging Monday.</p>
        <p>Yankees Manager Joe Torre, wanting to make sure that Williams will be healthy for the postseason, said before tonight's game that he did not expect the center fielder to play in any of the remaining six games on the team's current road trip.</p>
        <p>Torre asked Williams if he had felt any soreness before reinjuring himself. Williams assured him that he had not. But by asking the question, Torre was reiterating the importance of Williams taking care of his touchy injury.</p>
        <p>''I think he understands he could reinjure himself and let everybody down,'' Torre said.</p>
        <p>Williams first strained his rib cage on Aug. 18 and was sidelined for about a week. ''It feels better, but I still feel it,'' he said today.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch, who has not played in a major league game since Aug. 2 because of pain in his right elbow, could return to the Yankees' lineup Wednesday or Thursday. Torre would like to get him some game action before the Yankees face the Red Sox Friday in Boston, where Fenway Park fans have been abrasive in their treatment of the second baseman.</p>
        <p>Ramiro Mendoza could pitch against the Red Sox this weekend; his next appearance will be his second since June.</p>
        <p>The Yankees also called up the infielder Alfonso Soriano and pitcher Randy Keisler from Class AAA Columbus. The left-hander Ted Lilly -- most likely the last minor leaguer to be promoted for the final month of the season -- is expected to join the Yankees Wednesday. To make room for Keisler on their 40-man roster, the Yankees placed Darrell Einertson on the 60-day disabled list, after it was discovered today that he needs elbow surgery.</p>
