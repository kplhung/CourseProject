        <p>As they strode out of a Staples office supply store here, Bart Cirino lugged a plastic bag full of folders and binders, while his mother, Anna, clutched a yellow list that she had been carrying for more than two months.</p>
        <p>Parents at Jefferson Elementary School in Hawthorne, where Bart will enter the fifth grade on Wednesday, were given the list at the end of the last school year. It was intended to ''enable you to avoid the mad shopping rush in September,'' the principal had written at the top.</p>
        <p>But here it was, the day before the first day of school, and Ms. Cirino was hurrying to finish her back-to-school shopping. The bill for Bart's supplies was $35 for a haul that included a highlighter marker pen, a pencil box, a box of crayons and five book covers.</p>
        <p>Throughout the region, thousands of parents were engaged in the same last-minute scramble to get their children ready for school. Classes in many of New Jersey's public school districts begin on Wednesday. Others start on Thursday, as they will in New York City's public schools and in many other parts of New York State. Many classes in Connecticut began last week.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the ritual of shopping for school supplies has not changed in decades, with children seeing the promise of a new year of learning in their unsharpened No. 2 pencils and spiral-bound notebooks.</p>
        <p>But some parents say the lists of supplies required by schools are growing as more work is assigned in all grades and subjects, and advances in learning make new equipment a necessity.</p>
        <p>Barbara Fitzpatrick, who was dashing into an Old Navy store here to buy some orange cargo pants for her son, said the lists of supplies for her two children were considerably longer than last year's.</p>
        <p>''We had two pages of things to buy for the fifth grade,'' she said, referring to the shopping list for her daughter, Brianna, 10. That list called for a calculator, a pen with erasable blue ink and another with erasable black ink, most of which was bought at a Wal-Mart near the Fitzpatricks' home in Newton.</p>
        <p>''We had to buy a lot of folders and binders,'' she said. ''They're assigning a lot more work now, so maybe that's why they need more notebooks. I spent $55 for my two kids.''</p>
        <p>Roberta Cricco-Lizza of Montville  had to buy her daughter Carla, 17, a graphic calculator, a gadget required by many teachers to help students solve problems involving angles.</p>
        <p>''We never had those in school,'' Mrs. Cricco-Lizza said as she sat at the food court of the Willowbrook Mall here with her four children and two of their friends.</p>
        <p>Schools are not solely responsible for the growing lists of back-to-school purchases, said John Kirchberger, the principal of Hanover Park High School in East Hanover, N.J. Students are coveting more in this technologically driven age, he said.</p>
        <p>As more students conduct research for school assignments on the Internet, and more teachers reach students through e-mail, more students want computers at home, he said.</p>
        <p>Also, while beepers are illegal in New Jersey schools, many students carry their own cell phones. Some students are even showing up with their own personal digital assistants, hand-held organizers to help them keep track of homework assignments, Mr. Kirchberger said.</p>
        <p>''It's the old peer pressure. They say, 'Well, so-and-so has it, why can't I?' '' he said.</p>
        <p>At the Willowbrook Mall, Pat Freed said none of her three daughters had received a list of required school supplies yet. Their schools in Rutherford, like many others, wait until classes start before teachers pass out supply lists.</p>
        <p>So, Mrs. Freed and her girls have spent their shopping time looking for bargains in book bags, shoes and other clothes for their many activities -- fancy attire for band concerts, athletic wear for soccer practices, and everyday tennis shoes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Freed said she has finally learned that she should not buy all the clothes and shoes that her girls -- Kate, 15, Michele, 10, and Kelly, 8 -- will need for an entire school year before classes begin.</p>
        <p>''We'll buy most of our stuff in a month, because they'll have a growth spurt in September,'' she said. ''And if we buy too much now, then they get upset because they see what everyone else is wearing when they get to school, and it's not what they got.''</p>
