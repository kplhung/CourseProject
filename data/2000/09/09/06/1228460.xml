        <p>So the long vacation is over, classes have resumed, and the French are once again being bombarded with books. Not schoolbooks, please note, but no fewer than 557 new novels, all published within a two- or three-week period, all timed to coincide with ''la rentree'' -- the return -- to work, to school, to the theater, to restaurants -- that takes place en masse across France in early September.</p>
        <p>True, publishers everywhere know the seasons that are best for business, yet ''la rentree litteraire,'' or literary return, seems peculiarly French because it is not good for business.

        <p>So the long vacation is over, classes have resumed, and the French are once again being bombarded with books. Not schoolbooks, please note, but no fewer than 557 new novels, all published within a two- or three-week period, all timed to coincide with ''la rentree'' -- the return -- to work, to school, to the theater, to restaurants -- that takes place en masse across France in early September.</p>
        <p>True, publishers everywhere know the seasons that are best for business, yet ''la rentree litteraire,'' or literary return, seems peculiarly French because it is not good for business. Editors, booksellers and critics agree that the market cannot absorb the flood of new books, that many are doomed to sink even before they appear. But the tradition goes on: since 1991, the  wave of fiction has grown by 50 percent, with a new record being set this year.</p>
        <p>''It's uneconomical,'' said Pierre-Louis Rozynes, the news editor of Livres Hebdo, a French weekly devoted to the publishing industry. ''It's simply illogical to bring out so many books at a moment when the French have no money left after the vacations, when they're busy readjusting to school and work. But it's like the fashion shows: all the publishers want to parade their authors, always hopeful that one will catch the public's eye.''</p>
        <p>Certainly it is hard for the annual phenomenon to go unnoticed by the reading public. As in previous years, since late August weekly magazines and daily newspapers have been proclaiming its arrival with special supplements and lengthy articles in which the books of a lucky few novelists have been singled out for praise. No less typically, articles have also been lamenting what Le Monde last week called the ''permanent inflation'' of new books every fall.</p>
        <p>Press coverage is itself one good reason to publish at this time. A book is more likely to be reviewed and an author more likely to be profiled now than at any other time in the year, although Mr. Rozynes, for one, believes this does more for egos than sales.</p>
        <p>''The press, book critics and authors belong to the same world that is basically talking to itself,'' he said. ''But the relationship between articles published and books sold is quite disproportionate.''</p>
        <p>These articles nonetheless serve to draw up an initial list of 20 or 30 French novels -- this year's crop comprises 347 French and 210 translated novels, plus 460 nonfiction books -- considered worthy contenders for the literary prizes awarded here every November. Indeed, because these prizes, notably the Goncourt, Femina and Renaudot, virtually guarantee sales of 200,000 or more copies of winning novels, they too stimulate the onslaught. In reality at least half the time the top prizes go to novels from one of the three main ''literary'' publishers, Gallimard, Grasset and Le Seuil, yet this does not prevent smaller or more commercial houses from joining the race in the hope of a surprise. The ''literary'' three, though, frequently select and promote their novels for this season with the prizes specifically in mind.</p>
        <p>''The timing is the choice of the publishers,'' said Antoine Audouard, whose new novel, ''Adieu, Mon Unique,'' or ''Goodbye, My Only One,'' has just been published by Editions Gallimard, ''and what they have in mind -- and what I have in mind if I want to be honest -- is one of the prizes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Audouard is in an unusual situation, however, in that barely a year ago he was on the other side as director general of Editions Robert Laffont/Fixot. As an author, he admitted, he was delighted that his book was one of Gallimard's 15 ''rentree'' novels. But when he was a publisher, he recalled, he felt that the seasonal  tradition verged on the absurd.</p>
        <p>''The long-term trend is smaller print runs and more new titles,'' he explained, ''so it becomes like gambling. If you have more chips your chance of having one that makes money is higher. But it doesn't help the trade, the quality, the critics or the readers. It's just a panic. If you talk to any publisher, they'll say it's wrong. They think that in principle it's right to produce less -- but that's for others.''</p>
        <p>Olivier Nora, who recently took over as president and publisher of Editions Grasset, said there was an overproduction of novels throughout the year, although the ''inflation'' was coming less from established houses than from new publishing ventures, which see the seasonal push as an opportunity to be noticed.</p>
        <p>But many authors contribute to the autumnal glut by insisting that their books be released then. ''''That puts you in a delicate position because you can lose them if you refuse,'' Mr. Nora said.</p>
        <p>For publishers, then, the scramble is to have their books noticed, first by the press, then by booksellers. As a result books are being printed earlier each year so they can be sent out,  in final form, by late June to give critics and booksellers time to read them. ''Since it's costly to print just a few,'' Mr. Nora noted, ''you print all your fall books in the spring. That means you order your print run before you know the views of your sales people.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, because bookshops have limited display and shelf space, many books timed for the season are now distributed in mid-August in the hope that they will beat others for good display places. Struggling to manage the flood of new novels, booksellers frequently complain that the situation is out of hand, and that it is increasingly difficult to separate the good from the bad.</p>
        <p>''From June, we go to meetings organized by publishers, often with authors present, to discuss 'la rentree litteraire,''' said Pierrette Berthaume, the fiction buyer for a Left Bank shop that is owned by Gallimard but also sells books by other houses. ''We know some authors have a following. Some salesmen may have a good track record. I also took about 40 books home to read over the summer. We order at least one copy of every new novel. But inevitably there are good books that we miss.''</p>
        <p>With serious fiction, though, it is apparent that bookshops play an important promotional role, less through eye-catching displays common in, say, American book chains than through recommendations to regular clients. Ms. Berthaume, for instance, said that she and her colleagues gave a special push to books they admire in much the same way that independent bookshops do in the United States. ''Booksellers have growing influence,'' Mr. Nora said. ''In the past they'd call journalists for tips. Now journalists call them to ask what is good.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the sales strategies, there is no disguising that ever more books are chasing a fairly static number of readers. Further, polls show that the number of ''big readers'' -- of more than 20 books a year -- is falling, while the number of ''small readers'' -- 1 to 5 books a  year -- is growing, figures that suggest that serious fiction sold in bookshops is losing out to paperback potboilers sold in supermarkets. Mr. Rozynes estimated that 60 percent of the new novels (there are 76 first novels among this year's French crop) would sell fewer than 5,000 copies each.</p>
        <p>Much as France's protected and subsidized movie industry produces more films than the local market can handle, the abundance of books also reflects rules designed to help French publishing. Convinced that independent bookshops are good for society, the government not only supports them with subsidies but also blocks the emergence of discount  chains by requiring that books be sold at their cover price.</p>
        <p>The government also believes it is helping authors by banning book advertising on television, the theory being that television advertising would encourage the phenomenon of best sellers to the detriment of scores of other less-publicized books. The power of television is nonetheless demonstrated by book programs that invite authors to discuss their work, with competition particularly intense to appear on Bernard Pivot's weekly ''Bouillon de Culture.''</p>
        <p>The absence of a cutthroat business culture in French publishing is no less evident in the way editors and writers deal directly with each other rather than through literary agents. A handful of agents sell foreign books for publication in translation, but the idea of a literary agent hawking a book to various publishers in search of a mega-advance is still unheard of here.</p>
        <p>''When I go to book fairs some of my foreign colleagues ask me what I have bought,'' Mr. Nora said. ''My job is not to buy a book from an agent. It is to convince an author to write a book. The right question is, what have I commissioned?''</p>
        <p>For all the singularity of the way French publishing operates, it does have the effect of defending French culture. Just as the French can see more locally made movies than other Europeans, French authors are featured more prominently on national best-seller lists than their fellow writers in, say, Germany, Italy or Spain. And if ''la rentree litteraire'' is true to form, this will be even more the case between now and Christmas.</p>
