        <p>Time was when freshman orientation consisted largely of campus tours and introductions to the football team and the student newspaper.

        <p>Last week, for example, after the briefest of welcomes, incoming students at Baruch College were greeted on their first day with a discussion of the massacre of nearly one million Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994.

        <p>Time was when freshman orientation consisted largely of campus tours and introductions to the football team and the student newspaper. But in recent years, college officials have been trying to squeeze extra mileage out of those early hours on campus when students are most open to new ideas and experiences, offering them serious social issues to digest, not just choices of fraternity rushes.</p>
        <p>Last week, for example, after the briefest of welcomes, incoming students at Baruch College were greeted on their first day with a discussion of the massacre of nearly one million Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994. Rather than being asked over the summer to pore over lists of dormitories and teams, the students had been asked to read ''We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families: Stories from Rwanda.'' And Philip Gourevitch, the author of the book, was the freshman convocation's featured speaker.</p>
        <p>For the 1,350 freshmen at Baruch, a campus of the City University of New York, this somber introduction to the world of current events was like a plunge into an icy lake. It caught their attention.</p>
        <p>While the subject at Baruch was especially sobering, students at other colleges were also being steeped in the problems of the world. At the University of Pennsylvania, freshmen attended seminars on topics from eating disorders to bribery and corruption. Incoming students at Mount Holyoke College will be pounding nails with Habitat for Humanity. At Defiance College in Ohio, freshmen are fanning out to the community to register voters.</p>
        <p>Barnard freshmen are cleaning up a local playground and helping at local charities like the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and the Gay Men's Health Crisis. And in one of the more inventive twists on diversity, the Barnard freshmen joined students at Columbia last Wednesday for an evening of theatrical monologues reflecting differences in cultural practices based on essays from some of the freshmen's own college applications. The monologues reflected the experiences of an Iranian woman growing up in a traditional home, a Taiwanese student adjusting to the United States, a secular Jew dining with Orthodox Jews, an Asian woman attending a predominantly Cuban high school in Florida, and a black man discovering pride in the color of his skin.</p>
        <p>''Colleges are looking to recreate common experiences, particularly intellectual experiences that set an academic tone and raise expectations,'' said John N. Gardner, a senior fellow at the National Resource Center for the First Year Experience at the University of South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Such experiences were common 40 or 50 years ago, he said, when there was greater homogeneity of students and more commonality in the curriculum, but eroded in the 60's and 70's. ''Midcentury, it was easier to make assumptions about a body of knowledge that the students could relate to,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At Baruch, which had not assigned a summer reading before this year, Myrna Chase, the acting provost and a historian, said she had wanted a book that would ''make the students think about the world, about ethical concerns and about their responsibility for each other,'' issues she hoped the students would keep in mind throughout their college years.</p>
        <p>For nearly an hour last Wednesday, in Baruch's ornate auditorium at Lexington Avenue and East 23rd Street, Mr. Gourevitch, a slender, dark-haired man of 38, offered the students a kind of template for learning by relating his own odyssey from his days as a Cornell freshman in 1979 -- when he was excited and anxious ''about all that seemed possible'' -- to his exploration of the horrifying complexities of Rwanda.</p>
        <p>In words, he took the students with him on the physical journey to Rwanda -- flying for hours on end over the Swiss Alps, across the Mediterranean Sea and then across the ''vast immensity of the Sahara desert.''</p>
        <p>But he also tried to take them with him on the intellectual pilgrimage that began with questions about why the Hutu majority had killed 800,000 members of the ruling Tutsi minority, how the killings had been allowed to occur, and ''what hell was like.''</p>
        <p>He said he kept hearing that the genocide was chaos, but could not believe it ''because it seemed obvious that it required the opposite of chaos to achieve such terrible and widespread destruction in such a concentrated fashion.''</p>
        <p>Over and over again, he seemed to be telling the students that it was all right not to have all the answers when starting out, so long as one looks for ways to find them.</p>
        <p>Pushing students to think critically has become a major theme for colleges. Like Mr. Gourevitch's quest for answers in east Africa, the students' passage through college may also seem bewildering at times. In his preface to his book, before he even gets to the decomposed cadavers and still-clothed skeletons in a church on a rocky hill in eastern Rwanda, Mr. Gourevitch says: ''This is a book about how people imagine themselves and one another -- a book about how we imagine our world.''</p>
        <p>The worlds that Baruch students  come from are diverse. The college has admitted nearly 200 foreign students this year, as well as many immigrants who now call New York City home. There are nine from Africa (none from Rwanda), and many more from Asia, Eastern Europe and the Caribbean islands.</p>
        <p>Some faculty members and administrators, including the college's new president, Edward V. Regan, had feared that genocide in Rwanda might be too grim a welcome to college life or seem too far removed from the students' own lives.</p>
        <p>''When I first heard about the book, I said: 'Wait a minute. A lot of these kids open their front doors and see violence every day,' '' Mr. Regan said last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>But he said he had become convinced that Rwanda was ''a different order of magnitude'' and was pleased that Mr. Gourevitch ''wasn't wagging a finger at the students and telling them to go out and find out what the world is about.''</p>
        <p>In small group sessions after the convocation and later that afternoon, the students expressed mixed reactions to the book. Some had read all 353 pages. Others dipped into a few chapters. All had strong feelings.</p>
        <p>Kevon L. Logie, a 19-year-old freshman who came to New York from Trinidad last month, said the tensions between the more economically successful Tutsis and the less wealthy Hutus in Rwanda reminded him of the tensions between Indians and blacks in Trinidad.</p>
        <p>''He said it is not about class lines, but I believe it is,'' said Mr. Logie, referring to Mr. Gourevitch. ''Basically it was a class struggle.''</p>
        <p>Shanaz Gannie, 21, a junior who was one of the upperclassmen serving as counselors, said that while the book was a ''weird'' choice for a freshman summer reading, she thought it was a good one.</p>
        <p>''You can ask what genocide has to do with me, if you are planning to go into business,'' said Ms. Gannie, who was born in Guyana. ''But it helps you know there's another world out there. If you are going into marketing, you know that there are different kinds of markets.''</p>
        <p>Juliya Chernetsky, 18, said she definitely saw parallels with Russia, which she left when she was 7.</p>
        <p>''A lot of things were promised to people if they would turn against their own people,'' she said, alluding to the Rwandans who killed friends and neighbors.</p>
        <p>She added, however, that she did not think anything like the genocide in Rwanda could happen in America.</p>
        <p>But in a small seminar after his lecture, Mr. Gourevitch told students that they could find parallels in American history, too.</p>
        <p>''It's useful to think of the early American West,'' he said. ''Think of the desperado bands. The Indian killers.''</p>
        <p>Baruch officials pronounced themselves well satisfied with the Rwanda discussion, and said they hoped that students and faculty members would return to the issues in the months to come.</p>
        <p>David Potash, a history professor and director of academic services in the provost's office, said he planned to use the book in his American history courses in discussions about race.</p>
        <p>''There is no attempt to make people use the book in their classes,'' he said. ''But we hope it will come up and be a foundation experience for the students.''</p>
