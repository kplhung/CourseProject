        <p>Food for mind and body is on the menu in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, at the Read, 158 Bedford Avenue (North Eighth Street), a slightly threadbare but friendly used-book store and cafe. There, you might find an old copy of ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' by Kurt Vonnegut, to read while nibbling the chicken-walnut salad sandwich ($6) named after him. (Don't worry: the Melville sandwich features tuna, not whale.)</p>
        <p>The cafe has tables for about 20, with some more in a garden in the back. It serves every espresso-based drink imaginable. A highlight among the desserts is fresh peach cobbler, $3.50. New periodicals are as diverse as The Economist, Self and Punk Planet.</p>
