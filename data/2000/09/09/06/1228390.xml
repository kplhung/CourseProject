        <p>A study released last week on post office violence also sheds light on aggressive behavior in other industries. And there was plenty to report.</p>
        <p>First the good news: Asked what frightened them most in the workplace, 54 percent of the 3,000 nonpostal workers surveyed said they had no fears at all. And in fact, the chances of being murdered on the job were just 1 in 130,000.</p>

        <p>A study released last week on post office violence also sheds light on aggressive behavior in other industries. And there was plenty to report.</p>
        <p>First the good news: Asked what frightened them most in the workplace, 54 percent of the 3,000 nonpostal workers surveyed said they had no fears at all. And in fact, the chances of being murdered on the job were just 1 in 130,000.</p>
        <p>One striking finding: You're a lot safer from murderous rage in some blue-collar trades than in banking or just about anywhere else; homicide rates for construction and factory workers were less than one-third the rate for all occupations. Another: Taxi drivers are five times as likely to be slain on the job as police officers.</p>
        <p>But if violence resulting in injury or death is relatively rare, menacing conduct is widespread. Of those surveyed, 5 percent said they had been physically assaulted at work in the last year. Of those cases, 53 percent of people reporting attacks said they had been pushed, hit or kicked; 43 percent said something had been thrown at them; and 14 percent said they had been threatened with a weapon.</p>
        <p>In the study, conducted by Columbia University for the Postal Service, 16 percent said they had been sexually harassed in the last year, though the majority of incidents were verbal -- from lewd comments about the victim's body to unwanted date requests.</p>
