        <p>It used to be that an appearance by Mariano Rivera comprised three batters, one or two strikeouts and at least two broken bats. More and more, however, there have been hits and walks and some runs.</p>
        <p>The dip in Rivera's performance is relative, of course.</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly the game's best closer last year, when leadoff batters hit 3 for 62 (.048) against him and he converted 45 of 49 save opportunities, Rivera has been merely one of the best this year.</p>
        <p>Rather than completely overpowering hitters, he has created more jams for himself and has blown a higher percentage of save opportunities.</p>
        <p>Called on to preserve a 4-3 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning Monday, Rivera allowed a couple of hits and a walk and was somewhat fortunate when the Royals' Mike Sweeney -- who took confident, healthy swings, just missing a high fastball and fouling it straight back -- lined out to center field to end the game.</p>
        <p>Rivera does not like to discuss details of what he might be doing differently, what might be reducing his dominance. But even he appeared a little perplexed about why it has been tougher for him to get out hitters this year.</p>
        <p>''This year's been kind of wild,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nobody seems to have any true understanding of why this is. In the span of two sentences, Yankees Manager Joe Torre speculated that Rivera's velocity was not quite as consistent as it had been in the past, and then he mentioned that Rivera's control had been somewhat flawed -- compared with 1998 and 1999, when his command was virtually flawless.</p>
        <p>These are the symptoms:</p>
        <p>*The movement on Rivera's cut fastball has not been as good this year. Rivera simply buried left-handed hitters by pounding his sharply veering cutter inside, breaking their bats. From time to time this year, Rivera's cutter has floated over the plate, rather than dart inside. Left-handers have made much better contact against Rivera this year, although again, this is relative. They are batting only .221 this year, compared with .143 in 1999.</p>
        <p>*Rivera's control has been more erratic. He issued a total of 18 walks last year, and this year he has already allowed 23. And sometimes he has trouble keeping the ball down in the strike zone.</p>
        <p>*His velocity can be inconsistent, as Torre mentioned. Last week in Seattle and again Monday, Rivera was clocked repeatedly at 95 to 96 miles an hour. Perhaps because of mechanical trouble, he will suddenly mix in a fastball at 91 to 92 m.p.h., as if he has had difficulty maintaining the same arm slot.</p>
        <p>These could be the sources of the symptoms:</p>
        <p>*Rivera has had an unusual workload this year -- more innings, but his outings are coming in bunches. Sometimes he will pitch once in a week, other times he will be asked to get more than three outs twice a week. In 1998 and 1999, the starting rotation and other relievers were so consistent that Torre was able to reduce and regulate Rivera's responsibilities. Not so in 2000: Rivera has pitched 65 2/3 innings, after throwing 69 during the entire 1999 season and only 61 1/3 innings in 1998. It figures that as the Yankees wrap up a playoff bid, Torre will rest and regulate Rivera to keep him as fresh and refined as possible for the playoffs.</p>
        <p>*Rivera mentioned early in the year that he was having trouble gripping the ball, a problem that would have significant impact on his cutter. After Monday's game, however, he said that this was no longer an issue.</p>
        <p>*Hitters have adjusted to Rivera. ''He throws at one speed in predictable locations,'' one American League hitter said last week. ''He's not easy to hit against, but you know how he's going to pitch to you, and that at least gives you a chance.''</p>
        <p>There have been perhaps a half-dozen Kansas City closers in Sweeney's time with the Royals, from Jeff Montgomery to Ricky Bottalico to Jerry Spradlin. Sweeney seemed a little taken aback, then, when asked why Rivera has not been quite as dominant as he was the last two years.</p>
        <p>''I still think he's the best closer in baseball,'' Sweeney said. ''His ball is cutting really well. He's not going to walk guys. He throws hard. There are a few people who throw as hard as he does, but not many who have his command.''</p>
