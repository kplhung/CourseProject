        <p>An article on Sunday about plans by the Museum of Modern Art for a large expansion misstated the position of the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, toward zoning changes that would allow it. Ms. Fields supports the changes; she does not oppose them.</p>
        <p>In discussing public opposition to the project, the article also omitted the position of Community Board 5. On July 13 the board voted 27 to 3 in support, with one abstention.</p>
