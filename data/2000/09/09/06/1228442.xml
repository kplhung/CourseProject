        <p>Robert Krulwich, a ''Nightline'' correspondent, shows a group of teenagers a snapshot of Al Gore and draws a collective blank. Then he pulls out a photograph of Russell Simmons, a corporate executive. Instant recognition all around!</p>
        <p>If you do know who Al Gore is, you may not know that Mr. Simmons was one of the founders of Def Jam Records, the rap music label. He is also chairman of Rush Communications, whose holdings include Phat Farm. With these overlapping music and fashion franchises, you could call Mr. Simmons the C.E.O. of hip-hop.</p>
        <p>In his three-part impressionistic series on hip-hop for ''Nightline,'' Mr. Krulwich almost immediately establishes himself as a Gore-recognizing fogy. He begins his wry report with the image of the rapper LL Cool J grinning from his limousine at his enthusiastic fans in New York, who include a fawning policeman. ''LL Cool J has been famous for 15 years, or that is what I'm told, because frankly I am not a rap fan and I am a little old,'' declares Mr. Krulwich. Later he says with puzzlement, ''If you're over 40, this world's a mystery.''</p>
        <p>But the music that came shouting defiantly out of the ghetto 25 years ago has become a huge international business, and economics is one of Mr. Krulwich's reportorial specialties. So he plunges in -- or rather, saunters in, approaching his subject in the deliberately confounded style of Peter Falk as the eccentric detective on ''Columbo.'' (That series went off the air in 1977, just as rap was taking hold.)</p>
        <p>On tonight's episode, ''Hip-Hop Grows Up,'' using Mr. Simmons and his Phat Farm as the centerpiece, Mr. Krulwich slyly demonstrates how roaring capitalist success has harnessed this revolutionary form of gangster-celebrating music (or co-opted it, depending on your point of view).</p>
        <p>Mr. Simmons began his career 20 years ago as a young man promoting raucous parties in the Bronx. Now, at 42, he has become a caricature of a nouveau riche mogul. He has a much younger -- and, of course, fabulous-looking -- wife, the 23-year-old fashion model and television hostess Kimora Lee. He shops with The Robb Report, which specializes in brands like Boucheron and Cartier (''ridiculously lavish'' brands, to use Mr. Krulwich's description). He denies his own fallibility, as rich people tend to. ''What do you mean my body's going to change shape?'' he responds defiantly when Mr. Krulwich asks him if, as a trendsetter for people ages 15 to 25, he's worried about growing older and wider. Luckily, Phat Farm's baggy hip-hop fashions give middle-aged men plenty of deniability in the love-handles arena.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krulwich captures the supreme self-confidence and accessibility that has helped Mr. Simmons acquire a net worth of $200 million. As supremely self-confident people do, he has a trademark outfit -- a baseball cap and sparkling Adidas, even when he's otherwise dressed in more-or-less conventional evening clothes. Yet when young recording star hopefuls greet him at the elevator in his sleek corporate office building, he listens politely to their rap and takes their demo tapes. He met Kevin Leong, the 23-year-old former graffiti artist who is now Phat Farm's chief clothing designer, on the elevator. (Mr. Leong is featured in the third episode.)</p>
        <p>On camera, as Mr. Krulwich follows him through his workday, Mr. Simmons is breezily arrogant, as if he had been bred in Hollywood instead of in Hollis, Queens, by middle-class teachers. Asked him why a white 50-year-old banker in Des Moines isn't hip-hop, Mr. Simmons replies dismissively -- and quickly because he's about to pick up the phone (again): ''You are going to buy at Old Navy, you're going to be corny, you ain't got no flavor, you don't know what's new and hot.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Krulwich, whose fashion preference is the rumpled look, gives Mr. Simmons's emphasis on clothes and on what's ''new and hot'' a friendly sociological spin. ''Hip-hop culture was born in poor neighborhoods where people dream of owning things that instantly confer status -- the right clothes, hot logos, brand names,'' he observes.</p>
        <p>But he does seem to wince when a clothing designer describes the Simmonses' personal extravagance as an important marketing tool for Phat Farm. Becoming what you buy, the designer explains, is ''the American dream.'' The correspondent says dubiously, ''Well, it's an American dream.''</p>
        <p>Showing how enmeshed rap has become in the culture, the issue of rap-related violence doesn't emerge until Part 2, to be shown tomorrow night. Listening to the lyrics of a Jay-Z song about rough sex with a prostitute and murder, Mr. Krulwich says, ''I find this music offensive.''</p>
        <p>But for the cagey reporter, stating an opinion is just another way of opening an inquiry. Lyor Cohen, Mr. Simmons's partner in Def Jam Records and the son of Israeli parents, says that Mr. Krulwich should find the music offensive because destroying the establishment is a time-honored tradition in music.</p>
        <p>That acknowledged, Mr. Krulwich still distinguishes rap from other once-revolutionary forms of music like rock 'n' roll, jazz and ragtime. He questions the merits of rap lyrics that are often dirty and graphically violent. ''How could this have any lasting value?'' he asks. (You'll have to watch the program to learn the answer. The second half of Part 2 wasn't available for screening.)</p>
        <p>This is an amicable investigation, however, so in Friday's episode Mr. Krulwich also manages to find a quiet, poignant figure in the highly charged, materialistic hip-hop world. Joseph Sadler, known as Grand Master Flash, was the man who found his calling in the breaks between the grooves in records. For three years in the 1970's he sat in his room spinning records, composing riffs that could be tucked inside the beat. He developed ''scratching,'' an improvisational style that became intrinsic to hip-hop music. There was no money in it then, just an idea about music. Imagine that.</p>
