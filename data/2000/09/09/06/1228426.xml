        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: POLICE LEADERS SWORN IN  Bernard B. Kerik was sworn in yesterday as New York City's 40th police commissioner, and he pledged to work to improve the Police Department's troubled relationship with the community and to develop a way to measure progress toward that goal. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani administered the oath to him and to the new first deputy commissioner, Joseph P. Dunne, in the presence of officials including United States Attorneys Mary Jo White of Manhattan and Loretta E. Lynch of Brooklyn, who are investigating possible civil rights abuses by the department.  William K. Rashbaum (NYT)</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: SUPPORT FOR CITY CASINO  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said during a news conference yesterday that he would welcome a casino in Manhattan built by Donald J. Trump or ''anyone else'' as long as there was no involvement with organized crime and the profits benefited New York City. Yesterday's New York Post quoted Mr. Trump as saying that he might work with an Indian tribe to develop ''the world's largest casino'' on the Upper West Side. Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge called the idea ''preposterous'' and said that Mr. Trump's ''childish threat'' was issued because he disliked the idea of a casino in the Catskills competing with his casinos in New Jersey.

        <p>BRONX: MAN SLAIN IN APARTMENT  One man was shot dead and another critically injured in an apparent robbery attempt at an apartment, the police said. The shootings happened around 6:10 p.m. at 1370 Virginia Avenue in Parkchester, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. One man, 31, died after being shot numerous times in the bathtub. The other man, 24, was in critical condition at Jacobi Medical Center, Detective Pentangelo said. Neither victim's name was released. It was not clear if anything was taken from the apartment, the detective said. The police found a large amount of an unspecified drug in the apartment, an investigator said.  Andy Newman (NYT)</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN: SUBWAY PUSHER SEEMED 'NORMAL'  The man who pushed Edgar Rivera into the path of a subway train that severed both his legs seemed ''normal,'' ''clean'' and ''not drunk'' at the time of his arrest, the arresting officer testified yesterday. The man identified as Mr. Rivera's attacker, Julio Perez, has a history of mental illness, and his mental health at the time of the incident is expected to be an important factor in his trial in the fall. The officer, Julio Agron, testified at a hearing in Manhattan Criminal Court that Mr. Perez admitted to pushing Mr. Rivera, but that his explanation was not particularly lucid.</p>

        <p>ALBANY: TOP ASSEMBLY AIDE QUITS  Patricia Lynch, the longtime press secretary for the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, is resigning as of January. Ms. Lynch, 42, who went to work for the speaker, Sheldon Silver, seven years ago, is considered one of the most influential people in state government. She helped shape political strategy for the 98 Democrats who make up the Assembly's majority.  Raymond Hernandez (NYT)</p>
        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>HARTFORD: STATE SURPLUS QUADRUPLES  A report on the state's fiscal health released yesterday by Gov. John G. Rowland's office put the surplus for fiscal year 2000's $11.6 billion budget at $300.4 million, more than four times the 1999 surplus. Most of it is scheduled to pay for school construction. The report also said that 21,000 nonagricultural jobs had been created between July 1999 and July 2000. The state's July unemployment rate, 2.4 percent, remained well below the 4 percent national average, the report said.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>TRENTON: FRANKS GETS POLICE ENDORSEMENT  Robert D. Franks, the Republican candidate for the United States Senate, has received the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police, a union representing 14,000 New Jersey law enforcement officers. The union president, Richard Whelan, said yesterday that Mr. Franks's voting record during eight years as a representative from Union County supported tougher sentencing laws and an increase in the number of police officers. In accepting the endorsement, Mr. Franks noted that he supported the death penalty, unlike his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine.</p>

        <p>HOBOKEN: RAIL PARTNERSHIP QUESTIONS  Transportation officials in Pennsylvania and New Jersey have yet to decide how to divide the costs of passenger rail service between Scranton and Hoboken, scheduled for 2004. Federal financing expected to arrive next month would pay 80 percent of the preliminary engineering costs, but the states must negotiate an agreement, subject to federal approval, to share the responsibility for capital and operating costs. The rail line would carry passengers from Scranton and three stations in Monroe County, Pa., across the Delaware River into Warren, Sussex and Morris Counties in New Jersey. Passengers could then take New Jersey Transit trains that are already in service to Hoboken.  (AP)</p>
        <p>TRENTON: BRATTON HIRED AS CONSULTANT  The former New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, brought his team of law enforcement consultants to Trenton yesterday to begin a 6- to 12-month, $134,000 review of the city's police. Mayor Douglas Palmer said the city had hired the group to cut crime, lift police morale and improve cooperation between law enforcement and civilians. Mr. Bratton said that his group would do a ''cultural diagnostic, like a CAT scan,'' of staffing levels, union contracts and deployment practices of Trenton's 374-member department.</p>

        <p>TRENTON: EXPERTS, LAWYERS AND VIDEOTAPE  Trying to get civil trials to court more quickly, a committee of the State Supreme Court issued rules effective yesterday that limit lawyers to one postponement when an expert witness is unavailable. Under the rule, after the postponement the expert's testimony may be given as scheduled on videotape, or not at all. Although videotaping has been allowed for 20 years, some lawyers oppose it, saying it is not as effective as live testimony.</p>
