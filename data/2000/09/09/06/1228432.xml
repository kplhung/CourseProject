        <p>The Empire Paper Group will spend $20 million to buy the century-old Appleton Coated Paper Mill at Newton Falls in Potsdam, N.Y., preserving 130 jobs and creating an additional 120, state officials have said.  The mill's operation shrank last year when part of it was shut down, and the former owner had threatened to close it altogether if it could not find a buyer.</p>
        <p>Empire Paper Group was formed by Marquette Paper, a paper merchant in Elmhurst, Ill., and individual investors for the purpose of acquiring the mill, which will revert to its original name, the Newton Falls Paper Company. The state, under its Empire Zones business development program, has agreed to provide the company with property-, wage- and sales-tax credits, and the company can apply for a $450,000 grant from the state's Empire State Development Corporation.</p>
