        <p>Al Groh was watching for the signs Sunday: a flicker of fear, a moment of indecision.</p>
        <p>Instead, the rookie defensive end Shaun Ellis showed he belonged on Lambeau Field on opening day against Brett Favre, who has a street named for him in Green Bay.</p>
        <p>Now the Jets' top draft pick begins to prepare for another significant appearance -- Monday night against the Patriots at Giants Stadium. Ellis could be in an even better situation against Drew Bledsoe, who was sacked six times by Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Groh is big on symbols, and Ellis showed the continued improvement the Jets expected when they made him the first of their unprecedented four first-round draft picks.</p>
        <p>To Groh, Green Bay was more important than even the ''W'' that the Jets earned. To a team like the Jets -- a new head coach, new assistants and a rusty 36-year-old quarterback -- a good performance in a loss at Green Bay would have meant more than, say, a victory at New Orleans. But Groh got both, and he got something special out of his top-rated rookie.</p>
        <p>With the game tied early in the opening quarter, with the Packers having returned a kickoff 28 yards to get the Cheeseheads in the stands back into the game, Ellis entered the game. He recovered a fumble forced by Rick Lyle. It brought momentum back to the Jets. New York did not score, but Ellis immediately deflated the Pack, and their pack, again.</p>
        <p>On the first play of Green Bay's next possession, Ellis sacked Favre, forcing a fumble. The ball was recovered by Green Bay, but the Packers' went nowhere that drive. Ellis had set the tone not only for the defense, but for himself.</p>
        <p>''A nice start,'' Groh said. ''What I liked was dealing with him on the sidelines. He had the sense, 'Gee, I really belong here.' ''</p>
        <p>Groh said Ellis was one of several players he scrutinized on the sideline for their confidence level. ''Of course,'' he said, ''nothing could be better for a young player to cause a fumble and recover a fumble on successive plays.''</p>
        <p>Also, there was another sack by Ellis -- but it didn't count. Ellis dumped Favre on a third-and-10, but Aaron Glenn was penalized for holding.</p>
        <p>And yet, Groh does not say he will start Ellis against the Patriots. Ellis started three games at left end during the preseason, but on opening day Groh decided to return Rick Lyle to left end and use an off-season acquisition, Shane Burton, at right end. Ellis saw action on passing downs, replacing Burton with Lyle moved to right end. He played all the time at the end of the game, when the Pack was in a come-from-behind passing mode.</p>
        <p>Ellis has taken in stride his first few months for pay. He survived the withering harangues of the defensive line coach, Ray Hamilton, who often questioned his heart and his smarts during practice.</p>
        <p>''Don't you ever quit on me!'' Hamilton shouted in practice during one aborted quarterback rush.</p>
        <p>Was Ellis bothered by Hamilton?</p>
        <p>''No, he's my coach,'' the rookie explained.</p>
        <p>Thus, in that matter-of-fact way, his N.F.L. debut was no big deal.</p>
        <p>''I was just going out to play,'' Ellis said. ''I made a play, just doing football things.''</p>
        <p>Of course, he says, this is different from the University of Tennessee, ''where we just went, period. Here you have to be more aware and thinking all the time.''</p>
        <p>In addition to his sack, he had two other tackles, which gave him the most of any Jets defensive lineman against Green Bay.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't so different,'' he said. ''No surprises. We just did what we practiced.''</p>
        <p>He sounded as if he expected to make it happen again. Groh thinks so, too.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>AL GROH praised his new defensive coordinator, MIKE NOLAN, one of three key Jets figures who will be on especially hot seats this season because of who was replaced. The others, of course, are WAYNE CHREBET for KEYSHAWN JOHNSON and Groh for BILL PARCELLS. Nolan's unit (which had been under the direction of BILL BELICHICK, now the Patriots' coach), held the Pack to mere 4-of-11 success on third downs. ''You can't fall into the genius syndrome, and try to call your team to victory,'' said Groh, in explaining how Nolan had given his players some latitude in execution. . . . This began linebacker MARVIN JONES's eighth season; he has played for five head coaches. Jones led Jet tacklers with nine, including seven solos. . . . This will mark the fourth straight year that the Jets will face the Patriots in prime time.</p>
