        <p>The popular thought in the off-season was that teams would take the offense of the St. Louis Rams and dismantle it, the way scientists stick bacteria under a microscope and investigate its genetic structure for weaknesses. Based on what the Rams did Monday night against the Denver Broncos -- displaying an offensive explosion rarely seen in the sport -- apparently no defensive coordinator has yet to devise the football equivalent of penicillin.</p>
        <p>Denver tried everything to slow down St. Louis in the 41-36 track meet on the speedy artificial turf of the Trans World Dome. The Broncos felt that the best defense was to attack quarterback Kurt Warner relentlessly. This season, St. Louis was supposed to be vulnerable to pressure. Blitz, blitz, blitz, and Warner would wilt like week-old roses.</p>
        <p>That was the theory, and then the game begins, and the speed of the Rams is overwhelming. Their quickness cannot be reproduced in daily practices by third-string duds on the scout team. Warner made the right reads on almost every blitz, especially on a screen to running back Marshall Faulk, who took the pass and raced 72 yards for a third-quarter touchdown. It was the kind of quick strike that exemplifies how potent this Rams offense remains.</p>
        <p>''That's the name of our game,'' Warner said. ''That's what we do. We spread it around. We get it to everybody and take advantage of what defenses are doing to us.''</p>
        <p>Another popular thought in the off-season was that the Rams were fat after winning the Super Bowl and would lose their toughness. That hasn't happened, either. Defensive end Ray Agnew was hit by a Denver offensive lineman on the side of his leg near his knee. It wasn't the first time that happened to Agnew or his defensive teammates during the game. Rams players felt Broncos offensive linemen were purposely hitting low, a complaint that has been leveled against Denver many times by other teams.</p>
        <p>St. Louis defenders often responded to the questionable blocks by getting into the faces of Denver defenders, which led to a shoving match or two. The Rams wanted to make their objections clear.</p>
        <p>''If anyone has any question about our toughness this year, we didn't put up with that nonsense,'' defensive lineman D'Marco Farr said of the Broncos' blocking. ''They were trying to destroy our knees. That's not cool. Everyone in this league is trying to earn money for their families and when you play Denver, those guys try to take that away.''</p>
        <p>Farr added: ''But what goes around comes around. Those guys will get theirs. If we see them in the Super Bowl, we'll see what happens. But if we don't, other teams will watch what they were doing to us on film, and will make those guys pay for how they block. No player in the league will put up with that sort of thing.'' Yesterday, it was announced that Farr is out a month with torn knee cartilage.</p>
        <p>The Rams were so angered by what linebacker Mike Jones called ''blocks that if you didn't use your hands to protect yourself, your career was going to go up in smoke'' that defenders began pleading to game officials to call penalties, as did Coach Mike Martz. Rams players did not like the Denver offensive linemen's blocking techniques.</p>
        <p>The Broncos deny they use anything but legal blocks. A player cannot purposely go after another player's knees, and players cannot use ''high-low'' techniques. That means it is forbidden for one offensive player to hit a defender high while another simultaneously hits the same person below the thigh. Game officials, unfortunately, sometimes miss those questionable moves.</p>
        <p>Is that tough enough for everyone? Any feeling that the 2000 Rams would not resemble last season's champions is wrong. Forty-one points wrong. Three touchdowns of at least 78 yards wrong. Over 400 passing yards from Warner wrong. It wasn't simply the jaw-dropping speed that made the Rams' first game on the road to defend their title so impressive, it was their toughness, mentally and physically. On offense, they withstood a brutal blitzing attack, and on defense, the Rams endured what they called illegal blocking schemes.</p>
        <p>St. Louis's performance should not be seen through a pessimistic prism, but a positive one. Warner did throw three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown, and the defense did give up 424 total yards. But Denver quarterback Brian Griese had a career night and the Broncos played what will probably turn out to be one of their best regular-season games of the year.</p>
        <p>St. Louis responded not by falling apart in the face of Griese's darts, or those nasty blocks, but by scoring 41 points, having three players with at least 100 receiving yards, a first for the organization since 1951, and sacking Griese twice late.</p>
        <p>Forty-one points. That's more than Seattle, Pittsburgh, New Orleans, San Diego, Cleveland and Tennessee all scored on Sunday combined.</p>
        <p>Yes, St. Louis will be just fine. This is a 14-victory team, maybe even 15. The best approach in trying to beat the Rams? Don't blitz -- and stay away from their knees. Otherwise, you'll just make the Rams angry.</p>
