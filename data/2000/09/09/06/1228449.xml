        <p>Homework was never this delicious. Colorfully iced sugar cookies in the shape of the letters A, B and C, a pencil, an eraser, an apple and a sheet of lined paper (but, alas, no Pokemon cards) are tucked into a small tin lunchbox from Once Upon a Tart, 135 Sullivan Street (Prince Street).</p>
        <p>Once the cookies are polished off, the box easily holds a sandwich and a carton of juice. It's $21.</p>

        <p>And going back to school was never this much fun: the bakery will hold baking classes for children 6 though 13 on Mondays from Sept. 18 through Oct. 30 from 3:45 to 5:15 p.m. The cost, $75, benefits the Sharing Foundation, which aids Cambodian orphanages. Reservations: (212) 387-8869.</p>
