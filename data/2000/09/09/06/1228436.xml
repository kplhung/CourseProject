        <p>Martina Hingis called Jan-Michael Gambill on Monday night with the bad, but expected news, that she was pulling out of their mixed doubles partnership, which meant an abrupt end to Gambill's 2000 Open. He was not pleased.</p>
        <p>While Hingis could go on to concentrate on her quarterfinal singles victory over Monica Seles, Gambill said that playing mixed doubles contributed to his third-round singles loss to Thomas Johansson.</p>
        <p>''It was getting late for her and she had three late matches in a row,'' Gambill said. ''She really wanted to play, but then she thought the best thing for her was not to play. It's unfortunate,'' Gambill said. ''I thought we could go far and maybe win the whole thing. It's O.K., we're still friends.''</p>
