        <p>The campaign of Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic nominee for the United States Senate in New Jersey, began running two new commercials on New York and Philadelphia television stations on Monday. Both ads -- ''Diner'' and ''Our Values'' -- present his major proposals while saying he is in touch with the traditional values and everyday concerns of middle-class families.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Shrum, Devine &amp; Donilon.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Like many of the commercials Mr. Corzine ran during the Democratic primary, both use now-familiar footage of  Mr. Corzine walking in diners, schoolhouses and police stations as an acoustic guitar plays in the background. They show him mingling with an assortment of  racially and ethnically diverse citizens, nearly all of whom look at him with adoring smiles as he chats, shakes hands and, in one case, engages in a rather ungainly ''high five.''</p>
        <p>SCRIPT -- ''Diner''</p>
        <p>''From diners, to the Shore, to senior centers, to our schools, he's sat with us, listened to us, talked with us and told us what he'd do. Jon Corzine.</p>
        <p>''He's the candidate who says we have to put Social Security in a lock box where the politicians can't touch it. He's the one who supports a guaranteed prescription drug benefit under Medicare and a real patients' bill of rights for all our citizens. He's the one who favors universal preschool and setting higher standards in our schools. He's had the courage to call for licensing and registering all guns and to stand up to protect the rights of us all. He has the fiscal discipline of a successful businessman and the faith in the American dream of someone who had to work for everything he's gotten in life. Standing with us.  Fighting for us. Jon Corzine in the Senate.''</p>
        <p>''Our Values''</p>
        <p>''It's about standing up for the things that matter most to us. Jon Corzine is the one Senate candidate who supports guaranteeing quality, affordable health care for us all. The one who supports putting Social Security in a lock box. The one who favors a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. The one who wants to invest in universal preschool and Hope scholarships for college. The only one who favors licensing and registering all guns. Standing with us. Fighting for us. Jon Corzine. Our values in the Senate.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The commercials accurately reflect major planks of  Mr. Corzine's platform. But they give the impression that he alone favors proposals for a Social Security ''lock box,'' despite the fact that his Republican opponent, Robert D. Franks, voted for it as a congressman.  And while Mr. Corzine was indisputably a successful businessman, the reference to his ''fiscal discipline'' is open to debate on several fronts. He is proposing huge increases in social spending that could strain the federal budget. Mr. Corzine also spent $35 million of his own money in the Senate primary.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- By dipping into his deep pockets and starting commercials nine weeks before the election, Mr. Corzine has the luxury of defining himself to voters who don't know him. These also seek to put a more moderate face on a platform that is among the most liberal of any major party Congressional candidate. The look, script and upbeat tone of these ads are all similar to the commercials in the primary that helped vault Mr. Corzine from political obscurity into national recognition. As Mr. Corzine's spending totals mount, however,  he runs the risk of offending voters who are concerned about the rising cost of campaigns.</p>
