        <p>''LOOK at me!'' the Olympic fencing champ and coach Peter Westbrook is demanding.</p>
        <p>He's telling a heck of a story, a swashbuckling story, involving a sword and a crime and, as is not unusual for the old, unredeemed Mr. Westbrook, a great rage. His visitor would not want to miss a word and thus, head down, is taking notes, but this is not good enough for Mr. Westbrook, a man of formidable will.</p>
        <p>''Look at me!''</p>
        <p>O.K., is everybody looking at Mr. Westbrook? Age 48, lean and muscular, making his pitch at his apartment in Harlem. He has a fine shine on his shoes, having spent much of his life in sales -- in a way, he's still selling. He's also much in demand, as he trained three of the nine members of the United States Olympic fencing team, who will compete in Australia this month.</p>
        <p>Now the story: It is the mid-1980's, and Mr. Westbrook is living in Greenwich Village, and late one night a burglar climbs through his apartment window. Mr. Westbrook grabs a saber and gives chase.</p>
        <p>''I'm running down the street with this sword in my hand,'' Mr. Westbrook is saying. ''I was going to stick him with the sword, I knew exactly where. I would have, too, if he hadn't been fast. So I'm running down the street and people are looking at me like'' -- here he makes a terrified face -- ''like they think it's me, that I'm the one who's crazy. And you know what? It was me.''</p>
        <p>There are those who still believe that fencing is the exclusive domain of wealthy, privileged white people. They have not been paying attention. Mr. Westbrook, once a poor kid from Newark, part Japanese, part black, participated in six Olympics before retiring, earning the bronze in 1976.</p>
        <p>In 1991, determined to bring minority children into the sport, Mr. Westbrook used $10,000 of his savings to create the Peter Westbrook Foundation, which operates out of the New York Fencing Club facilities in Chelsea, tutoring 100 children weekly, most free of charge. Four of the country's top five saber fencers are graduates.</p>
        <p>What is Mr. Westbrook's secret?</p>
        <p>''The secret is there are a lot of kids out there people do not -- what's the word? -- look at as being valuable. They're unwanted, unappreciated, seen as undeserving. To most people they are nobody they would ever seek to find.'' The sound of a onetime I.B.M. marketing man. ''I go out with a marketing plan. There's so much raw talent to create not just Olympians, but lawyers, doctors, engineers.''</p>
        <p>And later:</p>
        <p>''When you asked me about why inner city kids are the best fencers, there was something I left out: They've got more rage, more anger, great fighting spirit. That anger and rage is what it takes to be an Olympic champion.''</p>
        <p>YOU don't have to look very hard to find the root of Mr. Westbrook's own rages: just go back to the Hayes Homes, the Newark housing project where he grew up. Mr. Westbrook's father, Ulysses, had been a G.I. during the Korean War; his Japanese mother, Mariko, was a war bride, and Mr. Westbrook's memories are of violence: His father putting out cigarettes in his mother's face; his father beating his mother; his mother on the floor, her leg bleeding.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Westbrook was 4 his father left. Mariko Westbrook supported Mr. Westbrook and his younger sister with factory work. When there was no money for food, she knocked on the neighbors' doors. She worked as a maid for a priest and they attended Catholic schools free.</p>
        <p>The young Mr. Westbrook was a thief and a fighter -- a very good fighter, he says; taunted because of his mixed race, he had to be. He started fencing, at Essex Catholic High School, only because his mother bribed him with $5.</p>
        <p>''I loved it,'' Mr. Westbrook says. ''Remember, I always loved fighting.''</p>
        <p>Success came early and fast. Mr. Westbrook was a statewide champion in high school, received a full athletic scholarship to New York University, attended his first Olympic Games in 1976 at age 24.</p>
        <p>Sometimes there were racial slurs. Mr. Westbrook used them for his game. If he had a white opponent, he conjured up a white face and rememberd an insult from a white man. If he faced the rare black opponent, in competition usually an Afro-Cuban, he pictured a black face. He never saw his father's face as he was lunging. His father hurt him indirectly, he explains. The insult had to have been made directly at him.</p>
        <p>But the rage was dangerous.</p>
        <p>''I could have killed somebody every day,'' Mr. Westbrook says. ''It's great fuel for the sport, but it started to seep out in life. Somebody might step on my toes in the subway, I'd start a fight with my fists.</p>
        <p>''I never put my hands on a woman. But you can beat women down verbally, emotionally. Just beating them down, making them feel bad when you should be uplifting them.''</p>
        <p>He went into therapy.</p>
        <p>His triumphs in the game continued. Mr. Westbrook met a woman, whom he would marry. But there was still a void in his life. He created his foundation and recruited aggressively, for students and funds.</p>
        <p>As for training, he says he uses all kind of tactics. ''They know we love them to death. We hug these kids, we kiss these kids. We do everything we can to nurture these kids.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Westbrook is creating what he wishes someone had given him as a boy?</p>
        <p>''Exactly.''</p>
