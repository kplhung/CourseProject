        <p>It was well after 1 a.m. when a few hundred huddled but hardcore tennis junkies inside Arthur Ashe Stadium witnessed the resilient 30-year-old, fist-pumping Todd Martin pull off a spellbinding comeback to advance to the quarterfinals of the United States Open with a 6-7 (3), 6-7 (7), 6-1, 7-6 (6), 6-2 victory against Carlos Moya of Spain early this morning.</p>
        <p>Once the 4-hour-15-minute match ended, an elated Martin took a jubilant victory lap around the court, high-fiving and hugging the fans who pushed him through the night.</p>
        <p>After back-to-back heartbreaks at the end of intense tie breakers, Martin steeled himself against elimination by seizing upon a letdown by his opponent in the third set and then whipping a wicked cross-court winner by past Moya to take the fourth-set tie breaker, 8-6.</p>
        <p>A crestfallen Moya had nothing left. As the match crossed the four-hour mark, the American took control. While completing his stunning revival, Martin conjured up images of one year ago when he survived a two-sets-to-none deficit to Greg Rusedski in the fourth round. After that match, Martin went on to lose to Andre Agassi in the finals.</p>
        <p>Under eerily similar circumstances last night, Martin defied the gray around his temples and looked fresher as the match grew longer against the 24-year-old Moya. With the compact but rowdy crowd cheering wildly between every point, the adrenaline fed Martin's youthful exuberance. He unearthed an unending flurry of passing shots that eventually left Moya numb with disbelief. Creating his own opportunities, Martin converted 6 of 22 break points while Moya managed 1 of 6. He also came up with crucial serves when he needed them and served 24 aces in what was the longest duel of this year's U.S. Open, outlasting the five-set, 4-hour-6-minute meeting between Max Mirnyi and Magnus Norman in the third round.</p>
