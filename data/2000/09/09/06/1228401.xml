        <p>Responding to a patent infringement lawsuit filed last week by Intel, Broadcom issued a statement saying the suit was specious litigation aimed at discouraging Intel employees from seeking jobs at Broadcom. Broadcom said that it had not infringed upon any Intel patents. ''The notion that we need to misappropriate Intel's technology to compete is nonsense,'' Henry T. Nicholas, Broadcom's president and chief executive, said in the statement. He said it was ''widely recognized in the industry and investment community that Broadcom, not Intel, is the leader'' in digital cable TV, cable modem ''and other key 21st-century technologies.'' Mr. Nicholas said Broadcom would defend itself vigorously.</p>
