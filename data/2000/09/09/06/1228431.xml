        <p>A New York State appeals court has ruled that the Foster Wheeler Corporation, a construction and engineering company, has no grounds for suing Broome County in upstate New York over the collapse of a deal in which the company was to build and operate a garbage-to-energy plant in the county.</p>
        <p>A four-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, in Albany, ruled unanimously on Thursday that the county's Resource Recovery Agency had not breached its 1988 contract with Foster Wheeler after a new county executive's opposition to the project killed it.</p>

        <p>A New York State appeals court has ruled that the Foster Wheeler Corporation, a construction and engineering company, has no grounds for suing Broome County in upstate New York over the collapse of a deal in which the company was to build and operate a garbage-to-energy plant in the county.</p>
        <p>A four-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, in Albany, ruled unanimously on Thursday that the county's Resource Recovery Agency had not breached its 1988 contract with Foster Wheeler after a new county executive's opposition to the project killed it.</p>
        <p>The official, Timothy Grippen, who took office in January 1989, contended that the proposed plant was too large and not economically feasible, and he persuaded the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to deny a permit for the plant.</p>
        <p>Foster Wheeler, based in Clinton, N.J., had sought millions of dollars in damages, its general counsel, Thomas O'Brien, said yesterday. He said no decision had been made on whether to appeal.</p>
