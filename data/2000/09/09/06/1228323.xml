        <p>A grandson of President Harry S. Truman died on Monday from injuries he suffered when a cab hit him on Park Avenue in the East 70's over the weekend, his family said. The accident is still under investigation.</p>
        <p>The victim, William Wallace Daniel, 41, was the son of the novelist Margaret Truman, the only child of President Truman, and Clifton Daniel, the former managing editor of The New York Times, who died in February. The second of four brothers, Mr. Daniel was a psychiatric social worker at the New York State Psychiatric Institute at Columbia University.</p>
        <p>The police would not discuss the investigation, but his family provided a copy of the police report, which said Mr. Daniel was trying to cross Park Avenue at East 76th Street at 2:40 a.m. Saturday when the yellow cab struck him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniel was hit just a few feet from the Park Avenue apartment building where his mother lived, said his oldest brother, Clifton Truman Daniel of Chicago, who flew to New York after the accident. ''He was just coming to spend the night, to sleep in his old bed,'' he said. ''We have no clue what happened. We don't know how fast the cabby was driving or whether he was even speeding.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniel died at New York Hospital on Monday from a head injury, family members and a spokeswoman for the hospital said. Besides his mother and older brother, he is survived by two other brothers, Harrison Gates Daniel of Manhattan and Thomas Washington Daniel of Starksboro, Vt.</p>
        <p>The police report said the cab involved in the accident was traveling north on Park Avenue, when Mr. Daniel, walking south, stepped into the street. The driver, Mohamed A. Dawoud, 29, of Manhattan, did not return telephone calls to his home yesterday, but he told a police officer that Mr. Daniel was crossing against the light, according to the report. A spokesman for the cab's owner, Kinky Cab Corporation, would not comment, saying officials had not yet reviewed what happened.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniel's friends and colleagues recalled his good humor. ''He was always the captain of everyone else's good time,'' said Mimi Gaber, his girlfriend. ''He was always arranging something or doing something spontaneous; the kind of guy who would hang glide across the Grand Canyon if someone challenged him.''</p>
        <p>At the psychiatric institute, Mr. Daniel was the coordinator and a chief researcher for a study aimed at reducing risky sexual behavior among mentally ill men at risk of H.I.V. infection, said Dr. Ezra Susser, who is overseeing the study. Dr. Susser, chairman of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia, said Mr. Daniel's co-workers only just learned he was the grandson of a president.</p>
        <p>''We had no idea who he was,'' Dr. Susser said. ''He never told anyone. I guess he wanted to be known for his work, not his family background.''</p>
