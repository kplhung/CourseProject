        <p>Greg Comella joined the Giants two years ago as a free agent. He toiled on special teams, banging around the frenzied free-for-alls until someone noticed. Now, after two seasons of anonymity, Comella is the starting fullback.</p>
        <p>Although his resume may not read like a blue-collar player -- Comella has a psychology degree from Stanford and spent his summers interning at venture capital firms -- his heart is rooted in the working man's life.</p>
        <p>And so is his choice in cars. He was driving a beat-up Ford Taurus more than a decade old, but upgraded to a Honda Accord at the start of training camp.</p>
        <p>''I guess at fullback you expect more of a blue-collar guy, a state school guy, not some elitist school,'' said Comella, who was not drafted out of Stanford in 1998. ''But my approach will never change as to the seriousness of the game. As a free agent, certainly there's a sense of urgency to make plays immediately. But that sense of urgency, for the good players, never dies. That's something that always stays with you.</p>
        <p>''You look at a guy like Jerry Rice, a guy like Michael Jordan, a guy like Tiger Woods, and they have accomplished so much and still their sense of urgency is higher than everyone else's. That's what makes them so good.''</p>
        <p>Comella, who is 25, added: ''Despite the fact that things have changed now -- I'm not a free agent anymore; my job isn't predominantly to go down there on special teams -- I'm now in the backfield and I'm now an important part of this offense. With all that being said, my focus, my preparation, the basics that got me to this level can't change. That can't ever change.''</p>
        <p>While Comella may have played at Stanford under Bill Walsh, he said he hardly fits the image that is more befitting of someone like Woods, whom he once shared a class with.</p>
        <p>''He was in one of my classes and there was a half-dozen of us sitting around studying the night before one of the finals, and of course, we're talking about spring break,'' Comella recalled of Woods. ''Guys are talking about going to Arizona, Mexico or wherever, and we get to Tiger and he said, 'Well, I'm going to Augusta.'</p>
        <p>''Now you have to understand there are a lot of good athletes at Stanford -- Olympians, basketball and baseball players -- so the average person didn't know who Tiger Woods was. We knew he was good, but we didn't have any idea. I really showed my greenness by turning to him and saying, 'Wow, you know the Masters is the toughest ticket in sports to get.' He looked at me and said, 'I'm playing in it.' ''</p>
        <p>Comella, who was never a full-time starter at Stanford, earned his starting job with the Giants this season, partly through hard work and perhaps partly through the process of elimination. Last year's starter, Charles Way, was forced to retire because of chronic knee problems. Comella may still be overshadowed, with Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne dominating the attention in the backfield in the Giants' 21-16 victory against the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday.</p>
        <p>But Comella did contribute, leading the team in receptions with five catches for 42 yards and also throwing key blocks on each of the three rushing touchdowns.</p>
        <p>''If the opportunity comes my way, I love receiving,'' Comella said. ''As a fullback, my job first and foremost is to block. But I think it's something I've always loved to do. It's always been one of my strengths. I played some receiver in high school and we had a big-time quarterback in Matt Hasselbeck, who is a backup with Green Bay now.''</p>
        <p>Coach Jim Fassel said: ''I think Greg is an athlete. He's got good hands. He played a heck of a game. He really did play well for us. He gives us a sense of quickness and athleticism. I think he can be a solid starter. He's got good technique. He's strong. He's tenacious. I think he fits what we're trying to do.''</p>
        <p>Way, who has worked with the running backs, added: ''He did everything that was asked of him. He's done what it has taken to develop into someone who deserves to start in the National Football League. On this team, blocking and catching is what being a fullback is about because we've got two backs that are going to have to get their touches. He's a glorified lineman, that's what he is. And he has made himself into that.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Giants re-signed cornerback RAMOS MCDONALD. To open a spot on the roster, the team waived tight end BRODY HEFFNER-LIDDIARD and then re-signed him to the practice squad. Fullback MICHAEL JONES was waived from the practice squad.</p>
