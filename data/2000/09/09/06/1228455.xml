        <p>AT the Greenmarket, where a long attention span is difficult to keep, it is easy to overlook them as your eyes search for peaches, tomatoes and corn. What you may miss are Tristar strawberries, tiny berries with an unusually late harvest and a flavor that makes regular strawberries seem dull. They taste like a cross of strawberries, fraises de bois and raspberries -- a mixture that's juicy and concentrated, almost jammy in the thimble-size ones.</p>
        <p>Most strawberry varieties produce buds in the spring and stop flowering, and thus producing fruit, after June. In the 1970's, Royce Bringhurst, a plant breeder in California, reconfigured the strawberry's internal clock by crossing it with wild strawberries from the Rocky Mountains, which flower through the summer. The result was a berry that lasted three seasons.</p>

        <p>AT the Greenmarket, where a long attention span is difficult to keep, it is easy to overlook them as your eyes search for peaches, tomatoes and corn.

        <p>Most strawberry varieties produce buds in the spring and stop flowering, and thus producing fruit, after June. In the 1970's, Royce Bringhurst, a plant breeder in California, reconfigured the strawberry's internal clock by crossing it with wild strawberries from the Rocky Mountains, which flower through the summer. The result was a berry that lasted three seasons.</p>
        <p>A few years later, Gene Galletta, a plant breeder in Maryland, developed varieties suited to the Northeast climate. The Tristar was among these; it produces fruit -- a small berry, fat and round at the top with a conelike bottom -- until early October.</p>
        <p>Tristars have not exactly been a commercial success, though. Because they are small, they cost more to harvest, and growers have had to battle pests. But the greatest obstacle has been home cooks who can't seem to accept late summer as strawberry time.</p>
        <p>Don't be among them. Besides, it is not a terrible thing to extend the strawberry shortcake season, as well.</p>

        <p>Pints of Tristar strawberries are about $3 at the Union Square Greenmarket.</p>
