        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The political debate about American military force readiness (front page, Sept. 4) is really about the readiness of the Army: neither the Air Force nor the Navy sends planes or ships into harm's way unless they have full crews and arsenals. Historically, an Army unit is deployed if needed, whether it is ready or not.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The political debate about American military force readiness (front page, Sept. 4) is really about the readiness of the Army: neither the Air Force nor the Navy sends planes or ships into harm's way unless they have full crews and arsenals. Historically, an Army unit is deployed if needed, whether it is ready or not.</p>
        <p>Since no unit is ever 100 percent ready, readiness status should be measured by the time that it will take a unit to become ready.</p>
        <p>Some advocate a change in accounting readiness -- for example, requiring units to be prepared to fight only one regional conflict instead of two. But by lowering our strategic objectives, we tempt would-be aggressors to take advantage of our inability to fight on two fronts simultaneously.</p>
        <p>A better solution would be a strategy that could support a continuing war and deter a wider war, as advocated by President Harry S. Truman at the beginning of the Korean War.</p>
