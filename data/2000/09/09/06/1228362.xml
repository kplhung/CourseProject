        <p>Life got real again yesterday. Bummer.</p>
        <p>The bleak summer of New York's discontent washed away with the conclusion of the Labor Day weekend, and that meant it was time to get serious about the arguable joys of uninterrupted work and homework. But what a slap in the face the city gave everyone. When you stepped outside the first thing in the morning, it was downright chilly. It was especially obvious that it wasn't summer anymore because the sun was out and there was a bright-blue sky.</p>

        <p>Life got real again yesterday. Bummer.</p>
        <p>The bleak summer of New York's discontent washed away with the conclusion of the Labor Day weekend, and that meant it was time to get serious about the arguable joys of uninterrupted work and homework. But what a slap in the face the city gave everyone. When you stepped outside the first thing in the morning, it was downright chilly. It was especially obvious that it wasn't summer anymore because the sun was out and there was a bright-blue sky.</p>
        <p>Next came a heavy dose of one of New York's favorite recreational activities: gridlock. Yes, the United Nations was holding its big summit meeting, 150 world leaders bounding into town, and the streets were backed up. The subways were crowded. Buses were slow. Inconvenience is a reliable fact of life in New York, but does it have to start on Day One? The summer ends, back to work, back to school, and this mess!</p>
        <p>The day after Labor Day tends to capture the temper of the fall, of the homestretch drive that wraps up the year. It could have been a better day.</p>
        <p>Dan Squicciarini knows that. He was standing outside the Verizon telephone offices on the Avenue of the Americas across the street from Bryant Park, slurping an ice cream cone in brash defiance of summer's end. He's 35 and a Verizon manager. Rackety demonstrators displeased with one of the world leaders were marching around the corner, invading his psychic space. A sizable portion of Bryant Park was closed, because workmen were erecting the tents for next week's fashion show. Nice way to bid goodbye to an abhorrent summer.</p>
        <p>''Naturally, Labor Day marks the end of the summer,'' Mr. Squicciarini said. ''Then you have to ask yourself, what summer? It was crazy weather. Yesterday it was high humidity and rain, and then I woke up today and it's cold. Soon we'll be freezing. Then the traffic was awful today. Summer is over, and then you have to deal with this U.N. deal and the fashion business. It's a little depressing.''</p>
        <p>He takes the bus in from Staten Island, but as it approached his office, it slowed to a crawl. He hopped off several blocks early and beat it to his office on foot. In front of the bus were several tractor-trailers lugging material for the fashion tents.</p>
        <p>It was obligatory to feel sullen, if not outright angry, about summer's ending, but could you rightfully mourn a summer that so betrayed vacationers? Mr. Squicciarini had mapped out a perfectly nice summer, scheduling all his Fridays off in July and August. Some of those Fridays were marred by, of course, rain. And Verizon workers went on strike in August. He worked 14 days straight. ''That was fun,'' he said. ''Some summer.''</p>
        <p>Jean Thies, 65, would have to agree. She runs a home import business (Buddhist items) with her husband out of her Upper East Side apartment. Last week, she returned from a two-week vacation in Vermont that was less than perfect. ''Rain, rain, rain,'' was her succinct description.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, she was at her country place in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She and her husband assembled their tomatoes and beans to freeze them for the winter, a stark reminder of the waning of summer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thies spent the rest of the weekend parked in front of the television watching United States Open tennis matches. Yesterday, she was ready to plunge into work, only to find everyone else doing the same thing and getting in her way. ''I went to the post office and the bank, and the lines were terrible,'' she said. ''It was a half-hour at each place.''</p>
        <p>Luckily, she steered clear of the United Nations, though it wasn't easy avoiding its repercussions. It was troublesome enough that all the world's dignitaries were coming to town at the same time. Among various pieces of bad road news, the police helpfully told everyone that any street between 34th and 110th and any avenue between First and Sixth could be closed for a motorcade. With how much notice? None.</p>
        <p>The dignitaries also meant controversy. Controversy meant picketing. Demonstrators unhappy with leadership in one country or another were out in full throat, further backing up traffic, making the city even noisier. Down 47th Street toward the United Nations, row upon row of demonstrators gave voice to their specific grudge. They were against Castro. Or Khatami. They were in favor of Taiwan. There were drums. Placards. Flags. The whole bit. Tourists snapped pictures. Police officers watched.</p>
        <p>Workers in surrounding office buildings preferred not to watch. They preferred to complain, a very popular New York hobby. They complained that they couldn't get across the streets to get to work or to buy a bagel. They complained that the noise made it hard to think. One woman, a lawyer, said that the whole thing was a total injustice. It was impossible for her to get back to her apartment in midday to walk her dog. She didn't care about a summit meeting, she said, nor did her dog.</p>
        <p>Some people began the next phase of the year in queasier shape than others. Jimmy Powers, 23, a construction worker in the city, decided to conclude his summer in emphatic fashion. With 10 friends, he went on Monday night to the Bardy Barn in Hampton Bays on Long Island. Beer was only a dollar, so he had a lot of beers. It was a diverting place. You wrote on people. You poured beer on people. You bought candy necklaces that women bit off your neck. Needless to say, he got home late.</p>
        <p>''I woke up at 5, still drunk, and had a long, hard day,'' he said yesterday after he finished his work. He said he didn't begin to recuperate until about noon, when he had an egg sandwich, a bottle of Gatorade, a bottle of milk and a banana.</p>
        <p>People made the transition in the fashion that best suited them. Eugene Heinlein, 48, an accountant from Wantaugh, N.Y., who comes into the city on and off to see clients, was sitting in Bryant Park, reading the Bible. ''It's a source of peace and a source of answers to questions that shall come up,'' he said. There were, of course, plenty of questions about what went wrong with this summer.</p>
        <p>He and his family -- he has three young children -- like to spend summer weekends at a cabin they have in upstate New York. ''With the weather, we didn't get up as much,'' he said. They needed to put a new roof on their Long Island home, but the weather slowed the pace of work and some of the materials got ruined.</p>
        <p>''As I get older, every summer gets shorter,'' he shrugged. ''This is my oldest year, so it seemed like the shortest summer.''</p>
        <p>September also suggests the start of the earnest part of the political season, when, if you plan to fulfill your civic duty, you have to focus on the issues, you have to sort through the verbiage and decide who really will drastically cut your taxes -- you have to figure out who the candidates even are. It's one more preoccupation.</p>
        <p>Casey Rode knew that was the case. She was just beginning her senior year at Manhattan College. She was from Baltimore and new to New York, thus perhaps assuming it was an annual ritual to have 150 world leaders in the city the day after Labor Day. She found all the traffic and horn honking exciting, because she had never seen so many cars together.</p>
        <p>She knew politics was on the agenda in some of her new classes. ''Yeah, I'm going to have to start thinking about it now,'' she said. She had to speak up. Demonstrators were going by, shouting, ''U.N., say yes to Taiwan!''</p>
        <p>''I'm not one way or the other yet,'' she said. ''I've got to do a lot of thinking. I hope I'm up to it.''</p>
