        <p>The Gore campaign today released a detailed economic blueprint for the next decade, including a new proposal for a $300 billion hedge against overly optimistic budget projections.</p>
        <p>The document also reiterates the vice president's commitment to eliminate the national debt and lists a broad variety of socioeconomic goals -- like increasing home ownership, reducing poverty and narrowing the pay gap between men and women -- that he hopes to achieve through proposals he previously announced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's idea for a $300 billion  reserve fund -- money that would not be spent from the federal budget surplus -- is intended to be a cushion against shortfalls in projections by the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates a surplus of $1.8 trillion over the next decade, exclusive of the surplus reaped by the Social Security system.</p>
        <p>While the Gore and Bush campaigns both assume the $1.8 trillion projected by the C.B.O., the Clinton administration uses the more conservative estimate of the White House Office of Management and Budget: $1.4 trillion.</p>
        <p>''If more conservative O.M.B. projections are met,'' the Gore blueprint says, ''this will allow an additional $300 billion of debt reduction. If unexpected costs materialize, this surplus resource will prevent us from going back to the days of big deficits, high taxes and deep spending cuts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's plan otherwise synthesizes proposals that he has made over the last several months into a variety of national goals. He is to discuss it in a speech here on Wednesday, and details are being published in a 200-page book, unique in modern presidential campaigns in that it is essentially a budget proposal that will serve as an economic and political manifesto.</p>
        <p>The number-heavy and footnoted book, which was made available to The New York Times, underscores Mr. Gore's determination to supply specifics in his policy proposals. In that regard, it is intended to serve as a counterweight to the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, which the Gore camp regards as feather-thin on policy and based largely on personality.</p>
        <p>The plan, which Gore advisers denied was timed to offset Mr. Bush's proposal today to overhaul Medicare, was drafted for months with help from Clinton administration experts like Robert E. Rubin, former treasury secretary; Laura D. Tyson, former chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and Gene Sperling, President Clinton's top economic adviser. Mr. Rubin is to join Mr. Gore for the presentation here on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign said its blueprint was the road to continued economic expansion. And realization of the goals that the vice president laid out, like reducing the poverty level to below 10 percent for the first time in history, and increasing the college graduation rate to 75 percent of high school graduates from the current level of 66 percent, depends on that  continued prosperity.</p>
        <p>The sum of Mr. Gore's spending initiatives, as presented by his campaign, is about $1.4 trillion, although  Republicans said it appeared to them that his proposals would mean new spending that totaled more than the  surplus of $1.8 trillion envisioned by the Congressional Budget Office. An analysis prepared by the Senate Budget Committee, headed by Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said Mr. Gore had proposed such extensive spending that he would have to dip into Social Security to pay for his programs.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign has also proposed targeted tax cuts that it says amount to $500 billion over 10 years.  But Republicans say these are illusory and so complicated that no one can be sure how much anyone would save.</p>
        <p>The Gore campaign said that its plan was sound and would eliminate the publicly held federal debt by 2012, while Mr. Bush's, it said, would leave the government $2.8 trillion in debt.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the centerpiece of the Gore plan is to eliminate the debt, through use of Mr. Gore's proposed reserve fund and the Social Security and Medicare surpluses. Mr. Gore would protect those surpluses by barring their use for any other purpose.</p>
        <p>One of the plan's socioeconomic goals is to double the number of families, to 65 million from 32 million, that have at least $50,000 in savings.</p>
        <p>Other goals include lowering the income tax burden on the typical family to the lowest level in 50 years, reducing the poverty level to below 10 percent, raising the number of families who own homes to more than 70 percent, reducing the gap between what men and women earn by 50 percent and creating 10 million high-technology jobs.</p>
        <p>To achieve those goals, the plan offers numerous tax credits and tax deductions for expenses like college, day care and long-term care, and to encourage savings.</p>
        <p>The plan says that through increased productivity, a Gore administration could raise family incomes by one-third over the next decade. It estimates productivity growth at 2.8 percent a year, by paying down the debt, investing in biomedical research and computer technology, and opening more markets abroad.</p>
        <p>His plan says Mr. Gore would reduce the poverty rate to below 10 percent by 2004 from its current level above 12 percent. He would achieve this by raising the minimum wage, expanding the earned-income tax credit and creating more welfare-to-work programs.</p>
        <p>The plan also sets a goal of cutting the gap between pay for men and women.</p>
        <p>Women now earn 73 cents for every dollar earned by men, according to the Council of Economic Advisers. The Gore plan would cut that gap of 27 cents by almost half, to 14 cents, through various plans that provide training programs to move women into higher-paying, high-tech jobs and more loans to help women start their own businesses.</p>
