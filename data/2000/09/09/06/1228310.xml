        <p>As the summer ends, the corporate earnings outlook is being undermined by signs that the economy is slowing. And some stock market analysts are warning that while profit growth will remain strong, the current projections for the last quarter of this year and the first of next year are too optimistic.</p>
        <p>The employment data released on Friday reinforced the belief that the economy was cooling after six rate increases by the Federal Reserve. In August, nonfarm payroll jobs, excluding census workers and strikers, rose just 140,000, well below the 222,000 average for the first seven months of the year. Manufacturing jobs actually declined, and manufacturing activity shrank after 18 months of growth, according to a purchasing managers' index. The big automakers are cutting production. Home appliance manufacturers, like Whirlpool, say slowing demand will cut into their profits the rest of the year. Department stores, already beleaguered, are warning of a weak end to the year.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, surges in the prices of crude oil and home heating oil for this winter will cut into consumers' ability to spend. Crude oil is now $33.83 a barrel, near a 10-year high and up 32.1 percent since the end of last year. Home heating oil is also near a 10-year high, at 97.97 cents a gallon, and already 41.2 percent above the average price of last fall and winter.</p>
        <p>While these factors suggest slower economic growth, the good news is that a slowdown does not have to be as sharp as in the past to be successful in curbing inflation. Put another way, the soft landing that the Federal Reserve desires can come at a higher growth rate than in the past.</p>
        <p>This means that the economy could be growing at a pretty brisk pace of 3.5 percent or 4 percent when the soft landing arrives and that the Fed could be finished with interest rate increases.</p>
        <p>''That's a fair point,'' said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Banc America Securities. ''The economy may not slow down that much.'' Even though he has one of the more bearish earnings forecasts, he still thinks the weakest quarters for corporate profits in the near future will be a 7.5 percent increase in operating earnings in the fourth quarter of this year and no increase in the first quarter of 2001. Then he expects earnings to begin growing again, with an 8 percent jump in the second quarter of next year and a 10 percent rise in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>According to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that third-quarter operating earnings, which exclude one-time charges and other nonrecurring items, will be 17.3 percent higher than a year earlier for the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. While that estimate has been trimmed from the 18.1 percent forecast in April, it is still very strong. For the fourth quarter, the growth forecast is 15.8 percent. The expectations of 17 percent and 15 percent gains follow a very strong first half, in which earnings surged 23.6 percent in the first quarter and 21.6 percent in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>One reason an economic slowdown has not showed up strongly in the numbers collected by First Call/ Thomson Financial is that it has been offset in part by the surging expectations for companies in the oil industry.</p>
        <p>The earnings prospects for the energy sector, including companies like Exxon Mobil and Texaco, have more than doubled with the rise in oil prices. Earnings are now expected to surge 77 percent in the third quarter, up from a 29 percent growth expectation in April and 62 percent in July. Excluding the energy sector, the earnings growth forecast for the S.&amp; P. 500 would be 14.7 percent, instead of 17.3 percent, Mr. Hill said.</p>
        <p>But after breaking down the averages, there are signs that Wall Street analysts are beginning to factor in an economic slowdown. For consumer cyclical companies, including Caterpillar, Dow Chemical and International Paper, analysts have reduced their earnings growth estimates to 6 percent for the third quarter, from 14 percent on April 1 and 12 percent on July 1.</p>
        <p>Earnings estimates for companies making consumer staples, including General Mills and Kellogg, are also falling. The current forecast is for growth of 7 percent in the third quarter, down from 15 percent in April and 12 percent in July.</p>
        <p>Another drag on earnings, though it is difficult to calculate, is the impact on the Ford Motor Company from the tire recall by Firestone. Because Ford recently went through a recapitalization, measuring the decline in earnings estimates cannot be easily done, said Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call. ''Clearly, analysts are lowering estimates,'' he noted, ''because Ford is cutting back production because of the Firestone issue.''</p>
        <p>Technology earnings estimates have held up, despite warnings of a weak second half from several companies, including Lucent Technologies, Xerox and Unisys. The current forecast is for growth of 35 percent in the third quarter, compared with expectations of 33 percent in April and 36 percent in July. Generally, as the quarter approaches, analysts trim their estimates as they get more information from companies.</p>
        <p>The suggestion that the economy need slow only modestly to curb inflationary pressures is a result of the surprising increase in worker productivity over the last couple of years. Because productivity has grown, the potential noninflationary growth rate of the economy has risen, a fact that has been acknowledged by Federal Reserve policy makers.</p>
        <p>When productivity gains were running at 1.5 percent to 2 percent, the noninflationary growth rate of the economy was thought to be 2.5 percent to 3 percent. The total allowed for about a percentage point from the normal annual growth in the country's labor supply. So to get a soft landing, economic growth would have to be slowed to about 2.5 percent, or less, to take the pressure off wages and prices.</p>
        <p>Now, Federal Reserve officials seem to agree that the noninflationary growth rate for the economy is as high as 4.5 percent because the trend line for worker productivity is approaching 3.5 percent. And Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, indicated that he was confident that the economy could continue growing at a high, noninflationary pace when he said in August that it was ''still difficult to find credible evidence in the United States that the rate of structural productivity growth has stopped increasing.''</p>
        <p>James E. Glassman, the senior United States economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, sees beauty in a modest slowdown. ''Corporate earnings don't have to slow down so much,'' he said, ''if achieving a soft landing today means slowing growth to 4 percent instead of 2.5 percent.''</p>
