        <p>About a year ago Ken Burns, the documentary filmmaker, sat down with his public relations advisers as well as executives from General Motors, his corporate sponsor, and PBS to figure out how best to promote his  documentary ''Jazz,'' which is to begin running on PBS in January.</p>
        <p>The 10-part series tracks the history of jazz from its inception -- during the days of the slave trade -- through  current times.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burn's first two major documentaries, ''The Civil War'' and ''Baseball,'' which ran several hours over several nights, had been shown before the Internet was a part of everyday life for so many and before cable was so aggressively programming against the broadcast networks and PBS.</p>
        <p>When ''The Civil War'' made its debut in 1990, and even in 1994 with the debut of ''Baseball,'' it did not take so much promotional work to convince people to watch a lengthy documentary on public television, Mr. Burns said.</p>
        <p>For those films, Mr. Burns said, ''you could probably put ads in the paper, get a couple of feature stories  and you had a huge percentage of the audience primed and geared.''</p>
        <p>''Now, you have to yell a little bit louder,'' he said. ''Just to get, maybe, even less.''</p>
        <p>With that in mind, Mr. Burns and his associates came up with what they are calling an unusually intensive corporate promotional and marketing campaign for a PBS series, one that is akin to those undertaken by corporate behemoths like the Walt Disney Company. It was put together by reaching out to various industries for which the documentary could be of interest.</p>
        <p>For instance, after being approached by General Motors representatives, Sony Music and Verve Music Group, the major competing distributors of jazz in the United States, have agreed to jointly produce 24 separate jazz compilations based on the documentary. Those compilation CD's will be offered for sale in record stores starting in November.</p>
        <p>Starbucks coffee shops, where the documentary will be advertised, will offer a ''Jazz'' CD for sale in January. Some of the proceeds from those sales are to go to the United Negro College Fund.</p>
        <p>Dan Klores, General Motors' public relations and marketing specialist, enlisted another one of his clients, the National Basketball Association, to promote the film with halftime jazz performances at basketball arenas throughout the fall. The N.B.A. will also produce television spots promoting the documentary.</p>
        <p>G.M. will sponsor jazz concerts and screenings of the documentary around the country and has signed on as a sponsor of the 2000/2001 season of Jazz at Lincoln Center. It also plans to underwrite a jazz education program for middle-school pupils around the nation.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Knopf is publishing a ''Jazz'' book by Mr. Burns and Geoffrey C. Ward, based on the documentary. It is to go on sale in November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns and PBS executives said they hoped that all the promotion would help the documentary reach wide swaths of the television audience that PBS does not normally draw.</p>
        <p>No doubt PBS has much riding on its success.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns's documentaries typically double, or even triple, PBS's average ratings. That kind of draw is more meaningful than ever to PBS' executives, considering that it now faces new competitors on cable, like A&amp;E and the History Channel, which show programs similar to those that were once the sole purview of PBS.</p>
        <p>Underscoring the importance of ''Jazz'' to PBS, the network was originally planning to show the documentary in the fall. But it instead decided to show it in January to move it out from under the shadows of the Olympics and coverage of the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>While the promotional campaign goes far, Mr. Burns said, it does have limits. ''We're holding off on the cups and the lunchboxes,'' he said. ''I don't think there's a Happy Meal in our future.''</p>
