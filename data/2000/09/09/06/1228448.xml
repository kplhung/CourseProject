        <p>CREAMY horseradish sauce is everywhere these days, from fast-food joints to serious restaurants. It doesn't seem to be in the repertory of many home cooks, however, even though it's absurdly easy to make with not much more than horseradish and sour cream.</p>
        <p>Horseradish-laced sauces are traditionally used with roast beef, and this version would be wonderful with a good piece of meat. But I love it on a fillet of crisp fish, sauteed, grilled or broiled. The best fish is one with edible skin and good, firm texture -- local striped bass is perfect, as are sea bass, red snapper and grouper.</p>

        <p>CREAMY horseradish sauce is everywhere these days, from fast-food joints to serious restaurants. It doesn't seem to be in the repertory of many home cooks, however, even though it's absurdly easy to make with not much more than horseradish and sour cream.</p>
        <p>Horseradish-laced sauces are traditionally used with roast beef, and this version would be wonderful with a good piece of meat. But I love it on a fillet of crisp fish, sauteed, grilled or broiled. The best fish is one with edible skin and good, firm texture -- local striped bass is perfect, as are sea bass, red snapper and grouper.</p>
        <p>I use prepared horseradish for my sauce because it works fine. You can use fresh horseradish if you prefer; just peel it and grate it (don't touch your eyes until you wash your hands well). But it won't make the sauce stronger. If you want more horseradish flavor, use more horseradish.</p>
        <p>And if you want it to remain strong, don't cook it -- horseradish loses its intensity as it cooks, becoming mild, even timid. (A chef friend of mine cooks horseradish as a vegetable, simmering it in water until it is tender, and then pureeing it. The result is not unlike turnip puree; if anything, it's milder.) Add it to the sauce at the last minute, and make sure the sauce is not too hot. Sour cream is perfect for this, because  it only needs to be gently warmed to become saucelike. Once the horseradish is stirred in, the sauce is done.</p>
        <p>The fish can be sauteed or grilled, but broiling is easiest. It takes less than 10 minutes and so little attention that you can prepare the sauce while the fish is cooking, making this one of the quickest elegant dishes I know.</p>
        <p>STRIPED BASS  WITH HORSERADISH SAUCE  Time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon neutral oil, like canola, grapeseed or corn  1 1/2 to 2 pounds fillet of striped bass (or red snapper, sea bass or grouper), skin on and scaled  Salt  Cayenne pepper  1 cup sour cream  1 tablespoon prepared horseradish, or to taste</p>
        <p>1/4 cup snipped chives, plus a few chives for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the broiler and adjust the rack so that it is within four inches of the heat source. Oil the surface of the broiling pan and place the fillets on top, skin side down. Sprinkle with salt and cayenne and broil until firm and lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes, depending on thickness. (The fish is done when it is just about opaque all the way through, and offers no resistance to a thin-bladed knife.)</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, gently warm the sour cream over very low heat in a small pan, stirring occasionally. While it is heating, add some salt and cayenne. The sour cream need not get hot and it should certainly not boil; you just want to take the edge off its chill and thin it out a bit. Keep it warm while the fish finishes cooking.</p>
        <p>3. When the fish is done, stir the horseradish and snipped chives into the sour cream. Taste and add more horseradish, salt or  cayenne if necessary. Serve the fillets with a bit of the sauce on each, garnished with a couple of chives.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
