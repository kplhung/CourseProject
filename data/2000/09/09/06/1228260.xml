        <p>LAFFEY-Eileen P. (Brouthers/ Johnson). Beloved wife of James, born to Mary (Cudahey) and Addison J. Brouthers on August 18, 2000. Died on her 81st birthday, August 18, 2000. Eileen attended St. Joan of Arc Parish and School in Jackson Heights and graduated Newton High School with honors. Eileen's only brother, Addison F. Brouthers was killed May 23, 1944 in Italy during W.W. II. Within months, she was devastated, learning her husband Lt. Howard W. Johnson had been killed in France, August 18, 1944. Being a ''dyed in the wool'' baseball NY Giants fan inherited from her grandfather, a member of the Cooperstown Hall of Fame, ''Big Dan'' Brouthers. Eileen perservered, elevating herself to General Office Manager of the most preeminent management consulting firms of its day. On April 22, 1950, James and Eileen were wed in a ceremony at St. Boniface RC Church. Eileen subsequently applied for and was accepted serving as Librarian for several years at Hunter College. Suffering from osteoporosis necessitated total hip replacement of both hips. After the operations, it became necessary for her to retire. Congestive heart failure developed, necessitating hopsitalization on several occasions. She persisted until visiting New York Presbyterian Emergency Room. After receiving her last rites, she passed on to her heavenly reward. Friends and relatives called at John Krtil Funeral Home at 1297 First Ave., NY, NY on Monday August 21, 2000 from 25PM and 7-9PM. Mass of Christian Burial was celebrated at 10AM August 22, 2000 at St. Catherine of Siena Church, 411 East 68 St. Interment followed at Gate of Heavenly Cemetery, Valhalla, New York.</p>
