        <p>The Bridgestone/Firestone tire defect now blamed for 88 deaths, mainly in Ford Explorers, eluded detection for so long because it occurred infrequently, even though it proved deadlier than many problems that occur more often in vehicles, Ford Motor and Congressional investigators said today.</p>
        <p>The deadliness of the tire problems, combined with a low rate of warranty claims for poor quality tires, is focusing attention on whether the design of the Explorer makes it especially vulnerable, the investigators said. The high death rate associated with a fairly small number of tire failures is striking because the nation's last big tire recall, in 1978, involved Firestone tires that failed frequently but were linked to less than half as many deaths.</p>
        <p>The investigators, who portray Ford and Firestone as both culpable in the crash deaths, also distributed copies today of an internal Ford memorandum from March 1999 that showed that Firestone opposed a tire recall in Saudi Arabia for fear that the tire maker would have to report it to United States regulators.</p>
        <p>Ford said it decided to recall Explorers in Saudi Arabia anyway, at its expense, to replace the tires. But Ford also said it did not tell United States regulators about the decision after Firestone assured it that the rate of accident claims on identical tires in the United States was average.</p>
        <p>House and Senate committees will conduct hearings on Wednesday to look into what Firestone, Ford and federal regulators knew about the tire problems, when they knew it and how they reacted.</p>
        <p>Congressional investigators and Ford disagreed today about the significance of the fact that Firestone customers turned in few of the millions of tires for replacement under warranty, yet Firestone received a high number of claims of property damage, personal injury and death.</p>
        <p>Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of one of the subcommittees holding hearings on Wednesday, said that the problem was ''a lethal combination of a somewhat unstable vehicle'' with tires prone to shed their treads at high speed. His own Ford Explorer, a green 1992 model, has been sitting in his garage for a month, he said, because he cannot find replacement tires for it.</p>
        <p>In 1978, Firestone replaced 17 percent of the 23 million tires in dispute to settle warranty claims even before that recall. Though Ford and Firestone have not provided warranty figures for the current recall, they have said that the figures are not markedly different from other tires, which typically are replaced under warranty at rates of one-tenth of 1 percent or less.</p>
        <p>Ford denied this evening that a low rate of warranty complaints, coupled with numerous crash claims, implied that anything was wrong with the Explorer. Jon Harmon, a Ford spokesman, said that many of the crashes involved tires on which the warranty had expired, so that warranty data would not have provided a clue about the problem.</p>
        <p>He pointed out that Explorers equipped with Goodyear tires from 1995 to 1997 have had virtually no problems. Even with the tire problems, Explorers have a lower death rate in rollovers per million vehicles on the road than did other midsize sport utility vehicles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harmon also noted that the current dispute has drawn national attention for only a month and warranty claims might rise; in 1978, the recall took place after 18 months of disagreement between Firestone and regulators, but that disagreement attracted much less attention than now.</p>
        <p>Helen O. Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for environment and safety issues, said that the warranty data was not always appropriate for spotting safety problems because it included a lot of ''chaff.''</p>
        <p>''People will complain, 'I don't like the way the white lettering is,' or 'it's noisy,' '' Mrs. Petrauskas said. ''If you have property and injury claims, chances are you've captured the more serious thing that has happened with the tires.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tauzin also complained that Ford had replaced tires for its customers in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Malaysia, among other places, without telling the United States Transportation Department.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Petrauskas said in a briefing with reporters that Ford voluntarily informs American regulators of recalls abroad ''if there's reason to believe that there's a safety defect in the vehicle.''</p>
        <p>But the company accepted Firestone's assurances that the problems in those countries were not relevant to conditions in the United States, after Firestone engineers dissected sample tires shipped back to Akron, Ohio, Mrs. Petrauskas said. Citing Firestone analyses that failures in Saudi Arabia, in particular, were caused by improper repairs and severe underinflation, she said she was still not convinced that tire problems overseas were relevant to problems in the United States.</p>
        <p>Ford and Firestone still refuse to recall in the United States the 16-inch Wilderness tires that were recalled in Saudi Arabia, saying that they have a low rate of crash claims here. Plaintiffs' lawyers dispute this.</p>
        <p>Ford today released a sampling of documents intended to show that it carefully examined tires when foreign customers complained about them, but it failed to spot a pattern.  Firestone, which is owned by the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan, repeatedly said that the problem was improper repairs or extended operation at extremely low tire pressures, or both, she said.</p>
        <p>Ford said that rollovers had occurred in 85 of the 1,424 American tread separation cases involving  tires now being recalled, which are 15-inch ATX and ATX II tires of the P235/75R15 size plus Wilderness tires of the same size that were made in Decatur, Ill. Most of the deaths, however, occurred in rollovers.</p>
        <p>Firestone, which will probably face criminal charges in Venezuela, had no comment before the hearings. Fleishman-Hillard Inc., Bridgestone/Firestone's public relations firm, resigned on Sunday and refused to say why.</p>
        <p>Ford and Bridgestone are both liable for damages resulting from crashes, Mr. Tauzin said today.</p>
        <p>A Bridgestone/Firestone presentation at the International Tire Exhibition and Conference two years ago in Akron reviewed the tire maker's experiments with a Ford Explorer equipped with the kind of tire that was recalled last month. A tire company engineer concluded that if the tread separated, the result was ''well within the range of a driver's ability to control a vehicle.''</p>
        <p>Ford provided a copy of the document, but plaintiffs' lawyers, and even some Ford officials, say that the bang that accompanies the tire failure could startle a motorist into swerving or braking sharply, either one of which could be fatal.</p>
