        <p>Martina Hingis sat in traffic for one agonizing hour yesterday afternoon getting to the United States Open.</p>
        <p>But when she finally took the wheel last night, she found herself halfway to the semifinals of the United States Open in an eye-blinking 14 minutes, joy riding on a superhighway littered with Monica Seles's unforced errors.</p>
        <p>Seles, a two-time United States Open winner, could only win a total of six points in the first six games. In the face of a precision-timing expert like Hingis, Seles's look was as blank as her first-set score.</p>
        <p>Yet the woman who has overcome more than just a one-set deficit recovered to give Hingis a challenge, if not better practice for the next round.</p>
        <p>Hingis, who won the Open in 1997, needed 48 minutes for the second set before she forced Seles to strike a backhand wide that gave Hingis a 6-0, 7-5 victory and her fifth straight United States Open semifinal berth.</p>
        <p>She will entertain a rematch with third-seeded Venus Williams, who rode a far bumpier path to their semifinal meeting, eventually undoing No. 8 Nathalie Tauziat, 6-4, 1-6, 6-1. Williams won her last match with Hingis, a quarterfinal at Wimbledon, en route to her first Grand Slam title in July.</p>
        <p>But while Williams clunked to her 24th straight victory yesterday, committing 31 unforced errors, Hingis committing only 13 errors and revealed very little vulnerability.</p>
        <p>If anything, Hingis even admitted that she was too good.</p>
        <p>''When you focus that much in the first set, I was cruising through, everything was happening so fast, I almost got scared, like 'Please slow it down, somehow,' '' Hingis said.</p>
        <p>Seles, meanwhile, was just looking to stop time before it was too late.</p>
        <p>''I really started off the match sluggishly,'' she said. ''My balls were flying all over the place. Maybe I panicked a bit. Against Martina, you're not going to get any free points. I started making so many unforced errors and the set was gone probably in 10, 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>''I thought: 'This is really bad. It could get worse. I could bag it in.' But at least I kept fighting and made it a better second set.''</p>
        <p>When Seles badly mis-hit an overhead shot long in the second set, bonking it off the racquet, the crowd groaned in sympathy and encouraged her to make another comeback. She started to attack Hingis, breaking her at 3-1, and then, when Hingis was serving for the match at 5-4, Seles battled to force six break points. On the final one, Seles was successful, sounding an alarm for her opponent.</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden it was 5-all and you're like, 'I've got to take control of the match again,' which I did,'' Hingis said.</p>
        <p>While Seles departs the Open for the fourth straight year in the quarterfinals, Hingis seems to arrive in the semifinals in top form. Yet she, too, has doubts, especially since she faces a powerful nemesis in Williams. If she gets past Williams for the 10th time in 16 meetings, as she did in last year's exhausting three-set semifinal, will she have enough left for either Serena Williams or Lindsay Davenport, tonight's quarterfinal opponents.</p>
        <p>''I felt like I was playing well so far,'' Hingis said. ''It was kind of a little test: Is it enough against Monica, or will it be enough against, Venus?''</p>
        <p>It could be enough if Williams is as giving with her errors as she was yesterday in her quarterfinal. In one telling moment, leading by 4-0 in the third set, Williams had just allowed Tauziat to break her serve for the fifth time, following her 10th double fault with her 29th unforced error, delivering a backhand into the net.</p>
        <p>But her biggest miss was yet to come.</p>
        <p>With an irritated harumph, Williams plunked her 6-foot-1-inch frame into her folding chair, only the chair was not there. It was three inches behind her. Williams sprawled onto the court, offering a snapshot of her game yesterday, a bit ungainly and out of sync.</p>
        <p>''I really missed,'' Williams said, at least able to poke fun of herself afterward. ''I was just angry. I just couldn't see.''</p>
        <p>When necessary -- no more so than in the final two games of the third set -- Williams played well enough, flinging her limbs to smash overheads and reach volleys, and rifled two stunning backhand passing shots on the way to winning her 24th straight match this summer.</p>
        <p>But her errors combined with her first-serve percentage of 52 did not seem to bode well for her semifinal rematch against Hingis.</p>
        <p>''I don't think she is going to win if she plays like this,'' said Tauziat, known for being blunt since her tell-all book about the women's tennis tour caused a small stir this summer. ''I think if she is to win the tournament, she needs to improve her level.''</p>
        <p>Even Williams agreed. ''I guess I'll have to play a little bit better,'' she said. ''I'll always play better when it comes to the big match.''</p>
        <p>Against the eighth-ranked Tauziat, Williams admitted she was less than inspired. She would roll her eyes petulantly after struggling with her first serve, and looked supremely uninterested during the second set. ''I wasn't competing,'' she said</p>
        <p>In Williams's third-round victory, a gritty Meghann Shaughnassy was the one testing her. Yesterday, she fought herself and her own frustration, losing her first set in the tournament.</p>
        <p>''I never get upset,'' Williams said. ''I was trying hard not to stomp my feet, swing my racquet around. Some players show a lot of emotion, but usually I don't.</p>
        <p>''That was maybe the main battle for me, why I didn't play well. I was too busy thinking about the points before, not focusing ahead. I don't feel I had my best performance. In the end, the win is on the record. I move forward.''</p>
