        <p>Technology stocks fell broadly yesterday, sending the Nasdaq composite index lower. Intel led the decline after an analyst said that its sales growth would be slower than forecast.</p>
        <p>Weakness in drug stocks, meanwhile, coupled with the slide in technology shares, dragged down the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. But the Dow Jones industrial average posted a gain, despite the weakness in Intel.</p>
        <p>The first day after Labor Day is often seen as a time when America gets back to business. But traders and analysts were reluctant to attribute much significance to yesterday's price action.</p>
        <p>''Given the strong gains Nasdaq recorded in August, when it was up 11 percent, the index was clearly vulnerable to profit taking,'' said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq fell 91.15 points, or 2.2 percent, to 4,143.18. Declines in Intel, Cisco Systems and JDS Uniphase accounted for more than one-third of the Nasdaq price drop.</p>
        <p>The S.&amp; P. 500 index slumped 13.69 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,507.08.</p>
        <p>But the Dow industrials rose 21.83 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,260.61, helped by a bullish forecast from Coca-Cola and gains in stocks like Home Depot and Proctor &amp; Gamble.</p>
        <p>Intel was the most active stock. The shares fell $4.69, to $69.25, after Ashok Kumar, an analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, cut his ratings on the stock to ''buy'' from ''strong buy.''</p>
        <p>The forecast for sluggish Intel sales brought down shares of other semiconductor manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Xilinx fell $2.81, to $89.06. And Applied Materials fell 38 cents, to $84.44.</p>
        <p>Analysts were reluctant to write off Intel, despite the downgrade.</p>
        <p>''Absolute fortunes have been lost trying to market-time Intel,'' said Philip S. Dow, a managing director in equity research at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis. ''This is a buy-and-hold stock until you know the world is coming to an end.''</p>
        <p>WorldCom fell $3.19, to $33.75. The company, a long-distance phone service provider, agreed to buy Intermedia Communications for about $3 billion in stock and will assume $3 billion in debt to gain a controlling stake in Digex Inc., which helps to operate Web sites.</p>
        <p>Drug stocks fell after an analyst at Banc of America Securities recommended that investors pare holdings in pharmaceutical companies.</p>
        <p>Merck slipped $1.13, to $68.06; Pfizer fell $2.16, to $41; Eli Lilly declined $2.94, to $69.75; and Pharmacia closed at $56.44, down $1.94.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola had its biggest one-day gain since June 22, rising $1.75, to $56. The company said sales should rise 5 percent to 6 percent this year and as much as 7 percent in 2001.</p>
        <p>Ciena was another drag on the Nasdaq yesterday. The company, a maker of telephone equipment, said it would take a charge against fourth-quarter earnings because a British customer, Iaxis Ltd., probably would not be able to pay its bills. Ciena closed at $216.33, down $13.80 on the day.</p>
        <p>But Niagara Mohawk Holdings rose $1.88, to $15.75, after the National Grid Group, which owns a power transmission network in England and Wales, agreed to buy the utility owner for $3 billion, or about $19 a share.</p>
        <p>''Utility stocks traded well,'' said Jonathan Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''There is evidence the economy might be weaker than we thought it was, so people are looking for a defensive tilt to their portfolios.''</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Treasury Prices Fall</p>
        <p>(By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices declined slightly yesterday in sluggish trading as players cast a cautious glance at rising oil prices and an impending onslaught of corporate debt.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32, to 108 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.67 percent from 5.66 percent on Friday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 2/32, to a price of 100 16/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 5.68 percent.</p>
        <p>Treasury prices fell early in the session as dealers returned from the long Labor Day weekend in a consolidative mood after weak economic data released Friday fueled hopes that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest rates for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>But the market clawed back from almost all its losses. Dealers cited the Fed's purchase on the open market of a scant $498 million of longer-dated Treasuries as a partial catalyst for the rebound.</p>
