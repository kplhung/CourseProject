        <p>The United States will not send observers or financial aid to Haiti for that country's presidential elections in November, a senior American diplomat said today, citing the Haitian government's unwillingness to recalculate the results of recent legislative elections that gave an overwhelming and disputed majority to the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>
        <p>Washington will also scrutinize all other development aid to Haiti to ensure that it does not go directly to the Haitian government, but through private nongovernmental organizations, said Luis Lauredo, the American ambassador to the Organization of American States. And it will review hundreds of millions of dollars in loans pending before international financial institutions.</p>
        <p>The measures were announced during a meeting in Washington of the O.A.S., which issued its own critical report of a recent mission to Haiti that failed to nudge the Haitian government towards resolving the political crisis. Other countries have repeatedly criticized the Haitian government for installing a Parliament  chosen using a controversial methodology that gave Mr. Aristide's Family Lavalas party 18 of 19 Senate seats. Electoral observers said that 10 of those seats should have gone to a runoff, but Haitian electoral officials have rejected their demands.</p>
        <p>''Absent new concrete steps to end the impasse, the United States will not be able to conduct 'business as usual' with Haiti,'' Mr. Lauredo said at today's meeting.</p>
        <p>A senior State Department official said that American diplomats visited Haiti last week to warn Haitian officials, including Mr. Aristide and his protege, President Rene Preval, of the impending measures. Among the points they pressed were the need to reconsider the contested election results as well as to name an electoral council that would have the confidence of the Haitian people.</p>
        <p>The last president of the provisional electoral council resigned and went into exile soon after the May elections, saying he had been pressured to ratify questionable results.</p>
        <p>However, the Haitian government's decision to proceed with the new Parliament, the first since January 1999, left the United States with few other options.</p>
        <p>While the official could not specify how much money would be withheld, the United States provided about $25 million for the last elections. The American refusal to provide financial assistance for the presidential elections could further hamper the image of Mr. Aristide, who is presumed to be seeking re-election to the office. ''Without aid it is going to cast further doubts on the credibility of the process,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>It would also present logistical problems, because poverty-stricken Haiti needs to register voters and candidates, set up polling places and hire poll workers. Many poll workers have yet to be paid for their work in the May elections, American officials said.</p>
        <p>Cesar Gaviria, the secretary general of the O.A.S., said that while the international community was willing to help foster a dialogue, the Haitian government needs to show its willingness to participate.</p>
        <p>''It seems there is no political will to resolve the problems of the May elections,'' he said. ''That increases the skepticism and the worries of the international community and some segments of Haitian society about democracy in Haiti and democratic institutions in Haiti.''</p>
