        <p>Editorial says ice-free traversal of Northwest Passage fulfills a 19th-century dream but raises new concerns for the Arctic's delicate ecology now deprived of its ice shield</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To some ears, the Northwest Passage still sounds like an old-fashioned geographic fiction, an article of faith for which men died rather than a real path through real waters. Victorian England never showed its true colors more truly than in its fervent response to the disappearance of Sir John Franklin's last Arctic expedition, which sailed from England on May 18, 1845, in search of the Northwest Passage and whose fate remained essentially unknown for a dozen years afterward. Rescue missions were staged, poems written, funds raised, theories proposed and contested. The very duration of uncertainty about Franklin became an element of the region in which he and his crew perished.</p>
        <p>All this makes the recent voyage of the St. Roch II, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police boat, the more remarkable. It traversed the Northwest Passage in a month without running into any ice. Moreover, it was one of at least three vessels to cruise the Northwest Passage this summer. On its voyage, the St. Roch II also came across the bodies of six of Franklin's crew -- bodies found with the aid of an Inuk hunter who was relying on old tribal stories.</p>

        <p>To some ears, the Northwest Passage still sounds like an old-fashioned geographic fiction, an article of faith for which men died rather than a real path through real waters. Victorian England never showed its true colors more truly than in its fervent response to the disappearance of Sir John Franklin's last Arctic expedition, which sailed from England on May 18, 1845, in search of the Northwest Passage and whose fate remained essentially unknown for a dozen years afterward. Rescue missions were staged, poems written, funds raised, theories proposed and contested. The very duration of uncertainty about Franklin became an element of the region in which he and his crew perished.</p>
        <p>All this makes the recent voyage of the St. Roch II, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police boat, the more remarkable. It traversed the Northwest Passage in a month without running into any ice. Moreover, it was one of at least three vessels to cruise the Northwest Passage this summer. On its voyage, the St. Roch II also came across the bodies of six of Franklin's crew -- bodies found with the aid of an Inuk hunter who was relying on old tribal stories.</p>
        <p>There is an almost bewildering convergence of time scales here. The alarm at Franklin's silence was not seriously sounded until more than a year after he sailed, simply because there was no way that news of his fate, good or bad, could have returned to England sooner. Sgt. Ken Burton, the skipper of the St. Roch II, relied on maritime telephone for instantaneous communication. Louie Kamookak, the Inuk hunter, depended on ancestral lore reaching back more than a century and a half.</p>
        <p>The voyage of the St. Roch II raised the possibility of a northwestern thoroughfare for seagoing traffic, the very thing first sought by John Cabot half a millennium ago. What unsettled earlier ages was the thought of a frozen North, capable of defeating the will even of men as energetic and resourceful as Sir John Franklin. What unsettles us is the thought of an ice-free passage through an unfrozen North, a world whose ecological delicacy has been protected through the centuries mainly by its inaccessibility.</p>
