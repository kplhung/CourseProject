        <p>It is no secret that gifted choreographers have been in short supply in recent years. Ballet has suffered most. Traditionally ballet choreographers have been dancers who developed simply by working with performers in their companies. Today, however, ballet is more a profession than a vocation and, with unionization, the days of sometimes brutal open-ended rehearsals are gone.</p>
        <p>Ballet has recently drawn on modern-dance choreographers for the new works it needs to sell a season. But some new ballet choreographers are developing from within companies like Dance Theater of Harlem, which opens at City Center tonight.</p>
        <p>The company will perform works by George Balanchine, Geoffrey Holder and other contemporary choreographers, as well as ballet classics like ''Creole Giselle'' that have been restaged for new times. But the centerpiece of the two-week season is a world premiere by Augustus van Heerden, a former principal with the Harlem company who is now its balletmaster. The repertory also includes a recent piece by Robert Garland, a former company member who is on hiatus from the Harlem troupe.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. van Heerden and Mr. Garland have solid training and performing experience in classical ballet. Mr. van Heerden studied the English Cecchetti style in schools in South Africa, his native country. In the United States he performed with the Boston Ballet during the 1970's and in 1976 partnered Margot Fonteyn, at her invitation, in a new work presented by the Scottish Ballet. Mr. van Heerden joined Dance Theater in 1983 and has worked as balletmaster for the last decade. He also restages ballets for the choreographer Glen Tetley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garland fell in love with ballet early on, he said, but ''trained in everything'' at the North Philadelphia School of Performing Arts and at the Philadanco school. He went on to the Juilliard School in New York City, but sneaked into classes at the New York City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet in the same building, where he also watched Balanchine rehearse. ''I liked the importance of ballet,'' Mr. Garland said.</p>
        <p>Balanchine has been one of his great inspirations. Joining Dance Theater of Harlem, which has a large Balanchine repertory, meant that he could embrace the ballets in a new way. Another kind of connection came as co-choreographer of ''Tributary'' with the City Ballet principal Robert LaFosse for City Ballet's salute to Dance Theater of Harlem in the spring. ''I was floored by Kyra Nichols, one of Balanchine's hand-picked dancers,'' Mr. Garland said of the ballet's lead female dancer. ''She gave me back my art.''</p>
        <p>Mr. van Heerden is a relatively new choreographer, having created his first ballet, a section of the three-part ''South African Suite,'' in 1998. Mr. Garland has had more experience. His first piece, he said laughingly, was for his little sister. He  choreographed it two months after he started studying dance.</p>
        <p>''It was to a song by Phoebe Snow,'' he said. ''We were both crazy about her.'' His next ballet was for an AIDS benefit, and the following one was the 1995 ''Joplin Dances'' for Dance Theater of Harlem, where he danced from 1985 to 1997. His second company work, the 1999 ''Return,'' will be performed at City Center.</p>
        <p>The opportunity to work on ''South African Suite,'' also choreographed by Laveen Naidu and Arthur Mitchell, the director of the Harlem troupe, came about with unnerving suddenness. ''I had always wanted to choreograph,'' Mr. van Heerden said. ''Mr. Mitchell had fallen in love with music he heard performed in South Africa by the Soweto String Quartet. As sometimes happens, one day without any warning he said, 'I think we should do a ballet to that music I loved so much in South Africa.' ''</p>
        <p>The score for the ballet is in part South African folk pennywhistle and ''bicycle shop'' music. ''It was composed on pennywhistles and sold only at bicycle shops,'' Mr. van Heerden said. ''Now the Soweto String Quartet have made wonderful recordings of the music, so I was familiar with it.'' In the time-honored fashion, he learned on the job, coming to the studio with planned structures and developing the steps there with the dancers.</p>
        <p>''Memento Mori'' was initiated with another sudden visit from Mr. Mitchell six weeks ago. ''You know we said you should choreograph more?'' Mr. Mitchell asked Mr. van Heerden. ''Would you?'' Luckily, Mr. van Heerden had been listening to a lot of music. He was drawn to a string quartet by the Latvian composer Peteris Vasks. ''It is dedicated to his sister and is called 'Musica Dolorosa,' '' Mr. van Heerden said. ''It is described as his most personal work. It is very beautiful and moving in places.''</p>
        <p>''Memento Mori'' is for three couples and a figure of death. ''In the ballet one person gets chosen, or gets ready to be chosen,'' Mr. van Heerden said. ''I had been recently thinking about death. My sister Dolores passed away not long ago. She visited from South Africa and loved this music.''</p>
        <p>Music is also of great importance for Mr. Garland. Know music history and theory, he tells choreography students. If they're not willing to pay attention to that, they shouldn't be choreographing. ''It breaks my heart to see kids using pop music and what they've heard in ballet class because that's all they know,'' he said. His ballet ''Return'' is set to songs sung by Aretha Franklin and James Brown, but for a reason.</p>
        <p>''Return'' was inspired by social dancing. ''There are lots of things in African-American culture that are not exposed enough,'' Mr. Garland said. ''One of them is the African-American social dance aesthetic. I am interested in seeing just how that fits into ballet. I had been wanting to explore black vernacular dance and its history. I hope to develop a vocabulary, to connect the dots in a new way.''</p>
        <p>That is not such a stretch as it might sound, he said. ''Alfredo Corvino, one of my teachers at Juilliard, told me never to forget that ballet always had the principles of modern dance in it. The two basic principles are drop and recovery and being off-balance. Balanchine used them so finely, whether it was instinctual on his part, which I suspect, or whether he was inspired by the modern-dance world around him. I think those qualities were lost somewhere in the migration of choreographers from Europe and in the resetting of classical works.''</p>
        <p>Something much simpler is at the heart of Mr. van Heerden's ''Memento Mori.'' ''I'm always grappling with the idea of dance as communication,'' he said. ''Sometimes we work so hard at being dancers that we forget dance is a complete communication. Dance is a complete art and the strength of it, possibly, is that even when you are just doing pure dance it communicates something.''</p>
