        <p>When John McCain lost the New York Republican presidential primary last spring, he placed a large part of the blame on what he asserted was an illegal $2.5 million advertising campaign that attacked his environmental record and had been financed by two wealthy Texas brothers with close ties to Gov. George W. Bush, Mr. McCain's opponent.</p>
        <p>One of those two brothers, Charles J. Wyly, popped up again on the New York political scene today. This time, he was allied with Rick A. Lazio, whom Mr. McCain, the senator from Arizona, has energetically promoted in television ads and appearances in the congressman's Senate race  against Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio acknowledged in this Rochester suburb today that Mr. Wyly is a sponsor of one of three out-of-state fund-raisers he is attending on Wednesday, this one in Dallas. Mr. Wyly is one of nine signatories to a letter asking Texans to attend the fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>''Many people believe that Mrs. Clinton is the driving force behind some of the most radical ideas put forth by the Clinton administration,'' the letter said. It went on to solicit contributions of $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for couples.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyly and his brother Sam are longtime associates of Mr. Bush. Using a loophole in federal election laws, they financed television ads that attacked Mr. McCain's environmental record. The ads were placed by an independent committee, ''Republicans for Clean Air,'' and were widely criticized as inaccurately portraying the environmental records of Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain filed a complaint about the ads with the Federal Election Commission. Mr. McCain, as a candidate for president -- and while campaigning with Mr. Lazio -- has championed curbing what he describes as campaign finance abuses.</p>
        <p>Through a spokesman, the senator said he had no comment on Mr. Wyly's role in Mr. Lazio's campaign.</p>
        <p>Asked about the fund-raiser, Karen Dunn, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, urged Mr. Lazio to cancel it. ''Rick Lazio wins hypocrite of the year award, soft money division,'' Ms. Dunn said. ''In New York, he's running an ad promoting campaign finance reform. But in Texas, behind closed doors, he's raising money from one of the worst abusers of campaign finance laws.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, here to promote his tax cut plan, noted the money being collected was so-called hard money, or money used to finance individual campaigns, which is regulated by the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Lazio has attacked Mrs. Clinton for raising what is called soft money, largely unregulated campaign funds raised by political committees, to  promote her candidacy indirectly.</p>
        <p>''All I can tell you about that is that this is all clean, hard donors,'' he said before flying to Mobile, Ala., for the first of the fund-raisers. ''These are all disclosed dollars. These are dollars that are protected under campaign finance reform.''</p>
