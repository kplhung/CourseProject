        <p>The Democratic National Committee announced yesterday that it would begin running a new commercial tomorrow that takes a critical look at Gov. George W. Bush's record of providing health care for children in Texas. The 30-second spot is to run in nine states that Democrats and Republicans have focused on most heavily : Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>

        <p>The Democratic National Committee announced yesterday that it would begin running a new commercial tomorrow that takes a critical look at Gov. George W. Bush's record of providing health care for children in Texas. The 30-second spot is to run in nine states that Democrats and Republicans have focused on most heavily : Arkansas, Delaware, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Democratic Victory 2000.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Video footage of Mr. Bush appears and dissolves. Cut to the faces of several young children. Then a gavel comes down and the words ''corrective action'' are superimposed on the screen. More shots of children are seen, followed by a final, scowling portrait of the governor.</p>
        <p>SCRIPT -- Announcer: ''George W. Bush has a plan for children's health care. But why hasn't he done it in Texas? Texas ranks 49th out of 50 in providing health coverage to kids. It's so bad a federal judge just ruled Texas must take immediate corrective action. The judge's findings: Bush's administration broke a promise to improve health care for kids. The needs of abused kids are neglected. Texas failed to inform families of health coverage available to a million children. The Bush record. It's becoming an issue.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The spot's central accusation is the citation of a ruling by a federal court judge in Texas on Aug. 14. The judge, William Wayne Justice, ruled the state had failed to abide by a 1996 consent decree and provide appropriate health care for more than 1.5 million Texas children who were eligible for Medicaid. What the spot does not mention is that the ruling was based on a class-action suit filed on behalf of Texas children in 1993, two years before Mr. Bush took office. The data that puts Texas 49th in the nation comes from Texas newspaper articles in 1999 that said only Arizona had a lower percentage of children without health insurance. The Bush campaign calls the spot a serious distortion, saying that last year, the governor ''supported and signed'' a bill that provides health insurance to 423,000 Texas children.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Much as the condition of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis's Massachusetts became a focus for Mr. Dukakis's Republican opponents in 1988, the eyes of Democratic advertising people will be upon Texas in 2000. Indeed, the commercial's closing line hints at more commercials of the kind to come. The Democratic spot is different in tone from the latest spot by the Republican National Committee, which, in a marked departure for this campaign, uses humor to take a swipe at Mr. Gore's character and play up the perception of him as a man who exaggerates his achievements. The effort in this new spot is to take on Mr. Bush on the issues, a form of attack that those who study political advertising say is often effective.</p>
