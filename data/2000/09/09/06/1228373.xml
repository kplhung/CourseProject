        <p>In an attempt to bring Nassau County back from the brink of bankruptcy, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta released an outline today showing how he would cut about $75 million from the 2001 budget by laying off more than 350 county employees and raising property taxes by an average of $33 per household.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said he expected that further savings would increase that figure to the $143 million in cuts  required in 2001 to help the county back to solvency, although he did not detail where those savings would come from. Additional budget cuts will be required in 2002 and 2003,  bringing the total to $293 million.</p>

        <p>In an attempt to bring Nassau County back from the brink of bankruptcy, County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta released an outline today showing how he would cut about $75 million from the 2001 budget by laying off more than 350 county employees and raising property taxes by an average of $33 per household.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said he expected that further savings would increase that figure to the $143 million in cuts  required in 2001 to help the county back to solvency, although he did not detail where those savings would come from. Additional budget cuts will be required in 2002 and 2003,  bringing the total to $293 million.</p>
        <p>Today's proposal met with a wait-and-see attitude, along with some criticism, as county legislators and a representative of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority began to study it. The authority, which had set today as the deadline for Mr. Gulotta to submit his plan, is an independent oversight board set up by the state to help the county restructure its debt, estimated at more than $2 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, proposed a $20 million increase in taxes, the first he has recommended since 1992. Mr. Gulotta had previously said he would not raise taxes.</p>
        <p>''For the last eight years I have either cut or frozen property taxes,'' he said, ''and I said I would only increase property taxes as a very last resort, as we explored our final options.''</p>
        <p>The County Legislature passed legislation raising property taxes 9.4 percent last year; Mr. Gulotta's proposal would amount to about a 4 percent rise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta estimated that the layoffs would save the county more than $20 million. Nearly 70 of those laid off would be nonunion employees, and more than 300 would be union members. Mr. Gulotta did not say which departments would be hit hardest, although he did say the cuts would not affect those departments that save the county money, like the Health Department does by investigating welfare fraud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's proposal would not require the layoffs of any police officers, although his outline includes $20 million in cuts in the Police Department: $10 million in concessions from the Police Benevolent Association, $2.5 million in concessions from the detectives' union, and $7.25 million from administrative reductions.</p>
        <p>The county executive said another $10 million could be saved through early retirement and severance programs for county employees, and $5 million through mergers of county departments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta must submit a proposed budget to the County Legislature by Sept. 15. If by the end of next month he does not come up with the cuts required by the state over the next three years, the finance authority will become a control board, taking control of the county's finances.</p>
        <p>Gary Lewi, a spokesman for the authority, said the group had not yet received enough documentation to form an opinion about the proposal.</p>
        <p>''We are hopeful that the document will pass muster,'' he said. ''It is in everybody's interest.''</p>
        <p>County lawmakers gave the proposal mixed reviews.</p>
        <p>''Certain elements of it look positive, as far as mergers and the consolidation of different departments,'' said Judith A. Jacobs, the leader of the Democratic majority in the County Legislature. ''We are concerned with layoffs. There was no impact statement attached.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot of analysis to do before we make a statement that's positive, negative or somewhere in the middle. I feel it will be somewhere in the middle.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jacobs said Mr. Gulotta had also talked about freezing the budget of Long Island Bus, for a savings of $6 million.</p>
        <p>The response was also lukewarm from Mr. Gulotta's own party, once dominant in the county and now under fire.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to react when you don't have all of the details,'' said Robert Lazaro, a spokesman for the Republican caucus to the County Legislature. He said more analysis needed to be done on the more than $60 million in additional budget shortfalls that were discovered on Friday, in debt service obligations, higher-than-expected public transportation costs and deficits at the Nassau County Medical Center.</p>
        <p>''It would appear that some of that may be inaccurate,'' he said, referring specifically to debt service costs of $25 million. ''How could the administration be that far off?''</p>
        <p>As for the tax increase, Mr. Lazaro declined to comment until he received more details.</p>
        <p>''My reaction is the same as to everything else,'' he said, adding that he wanted to know where the additional tax revenue would be spent. ''It's a mystery to us. Is anyone happy with a tax increase? No.''</p>
