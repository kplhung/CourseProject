        <p>PALLEY-Julie and Samuel. The trustees and staff of the Museum of American Folk Art record with deep sorrow the sudden loss of their dear friends and valued colleagues, Julie and Samuel (''Sandy'') Palley, devoted supporters of the Museum and thoughtful advocates of its growth and development as a major cultural institution. A member of the Board since 1995, Julie captured our hearts from the first day of her service as a trustee with her generosity of spirit, resourcefulness and respect for excellence. In her commitment to the Museum, Julie was joined by Sandy, her husband and true partner in life. His engaging wit, ready smile and quiet wisdom never failed to encourage us. Their tragic deaths deprive the Museum of the strength and inspiration of two of its brightest lights. They will always be remembered with affection and respect by a grateful Museum family. To their daughters, Margot, Kyra and Alix, we extend our most profound and heartfelt condolences. Ralph O. Esmerian, Chairman L. John Wilkerson, President Board of Trustees Gerard C. Wertkin, Director</p>
        <p>PALLEY-Samuel and Julie of Huntingdon Valley, PA. The American Folk Arts Society wishes to express its deepest sympathy to the family of Samuel and Julie Palley on the loss of their parents. They were wonderful friends who will be greatly missed.</p>
