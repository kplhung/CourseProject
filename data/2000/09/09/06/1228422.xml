        <p>Germany's defense minister was injured and briefly hospitalized today after a steel security barrier sprang up beneath his motorcade as it arrived for an honors ceremony at the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>The defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, suffered a scrape on his head and a cut on his foot when his car was struck by the retractable barricade, just after 4 p.m. The defense attache at the German Embassy, Brig. Gen. Peter Goebel, and an American security aide were also slightly injured.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said that the injuries were not serious but that all three men were taken to Arlington Hospital in Virginia for tests. ''His condition is, I think, very good,'' Mr. Bacon said. ''His spirits are very high.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scharping was released after slightly more than three hours at the hospital, where his eyesight was tested and he was reported to be fine. He received several stitches in his foot, according to Maj. Tim Blair, a Pentagon spokesman.</p>
        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen was with Mr. Scharping throughout his treatment, the spokesman said. Mr. Cohen canceled a dinner that had been scheduled in Mr. Scharping's honor, but they discussed business in the hospital, the spokesman said..</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Scharping ''was alert and in high spirits and was not in a great deal of pain.''</p>
        <p>It was the second time in two years that the Pentagon's security system had injured a visiting defense minister. In September 1998, Japan's defense minister, Fukushiro Nukaga, and five others were injured in a strikingly similar accident at the same barricade.</p>
        <p>That accident, attributed to a faulty sensor, prompted the Pentagon to install a new system for controlling the barricades, which were installed in 1992 to prevent terrorists from driving too close to the building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bacon noted that thousands of cars had passed through the barricades. ''We had no problems with the system until today,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Cohen arrived at the gate, Mr. Scharping was lying on the ground outside the car, which remained hoisted on the barricade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bacon said an investigation had begun, adding, ''We're always looking for the right balance between security and access, and unfortunately, the system here failed to provide access when it was required to do so.''</p>
