        <p>Clyde Haberman NYC column discusses controversy over Anti-Defamation League national director Abraham H Foxman criticizing Sen Joseph I Lieberman, Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, for repeatedly invoking God and faith on campaign trail (M)</p>

        <p>IT was sorely tempting to go straight to the source and ask God what he (or she, if you prefer) thinks about being dragged so boldly into the presidential campaign. But then a friend pointed out how it is obvious from ample evidence that God never speaks to columnists.</p>
        <p>That led to Plan B, which was to head yesterday to the police-saturated neighborhood around the United Nations and the offices there of the Anti-Defamation League. It was the league's national director, Abraham H. Foxman, who stirred the latest ruckus over religion in politics by criticizing Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, for repeatedly invoking God and faith on the campaign trail.</p>

        <p>IT was sorely tempting to go straight to the source and ask God what he (or she, if you prefer) thinks about being dragged so boldly into the presidential campaign. But then a friend pointed out how it is obvious from ample evidence that God never speaks to columnists.</p>
        <p>That led to Plan B, which was to head yesterday to the police-saturated neighborhood around the United Nations and the offices there of the Anti-Defamation League. It was the league's national director, Abraham H. Foxman, who stirred the latest ruckus over religion in politics by criticizing Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, for repeatedly invoking God and faith on the campaign trail.</p>
        <p>As luck would have it, Mr. Foxman answered the first question before it could even be asked: what has been the fallout from his slapping the Lieberman wrist, an interesting case of a Jewish organization going one on one against the first Jew on a major national ticket?</p>
        <p>A caller must have asked the same thing, because Mr. Foxman was heard saying into the phone:</p>
        <p>''We get calls from people saying they're never going to give us money again. Nine out of 10 of those cases are people who've never given. Others say, 'I'm resigning my membership.' We don't have members.''</p>
        <p>After hanging up, Mr. Foxman elaborated on the reactions to his contention that Mr. Lieberman had crossed the line of acceptable political discourse by linking morality to religious faith, a position from which he then retreated somewhat.</p>
        <p>(The senator also invoked the biblical injunction to honor your father and mother in explaining his support of subsidized medication for the elderly. It would not be a surprise, Mr. Foxman agreed when the point was raised, to hear someone using the same commandment to justify assisting the suicide of a terminally ill parent. The Bible tells many people many different things.)</p>
        <p>''What's happening in the Jewish community is coming out of two streams, both of them insecure,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''There are those who congratulate us: thank God you did this. They don't want religion out there because he's Jewish. It's his Jewishness that's the issue, and they feel uncomfortable with it being out there. The other side is unhappy with us also because of insecurity, and this is that they just don't want Jews to attack Jews. Both trouble me.''</p>
        <p>''What I found,'' he said, ''is a gap between America's preparedness to have a Jew up front and the Jewish community's readiness for it.''</p>
        <p>Of course, a debate over God's proper role in American politics goes well beyond an intramural Jewish dust-up. The issue has been around for as long as the country, and it has percolated this entire year. The Republican primaries were filled, Mr. Foxman said, with ''competition over who loves God more, who's more faithful to Jesus and his principles.''</p>
        <p>To him, talk of that kind flies in the face of America's pluralistic traditions. While it no doubt comforts many people, ''it also frightens a lot of others,'' he said, and hearing repeated professions of faith from a Jewish candidate doesn't make him feel any better.</p>
        <p>''What troubled a lot of people is that he used the line that the Constitution provides for freedom of religion and not from religion,'' Mr. Foxman said. ''That's a religious-right line. And it's not true, because it does protect us from religion.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''I think the American people are a religious people individually, probably more than any other Western nation. But most people also understand that we have no mandated religion and don't want a mandated religion.''</p>
        <p>BUT surely Mr. Lieberman's goal is not imposed religiosity.</p>
        <p>''That's the rationale,'' Mr. Foxman said. ''It's O.K. if he does it. But it reinforces and legitimizes that type of talk. The reason the Falwells and Robertsons come to his defense is because they understand that he softens the turf. They are a majority, and they do want their Christian -- what they now say is Judeo-Christian -- religion as the religion.</p>
        <p>''It's very dangerous waters.''</p>
        <p>All right, try this one on: Might not his attacks on Mr. Lieberman actually be a clever ploy to get a fellow Jew elected? ''I heard that on the talk shows, that this helps him,'' Mr. Foxman said. ''People believe in conspiracy theories on all kinds of things.''</p>
        <p>So this is not part of some Jewish conspiracy?</p>
        <p>''Not yet,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>For the irony-impaired, he meant that as a joke, so help him You-Know-Who.</p>
