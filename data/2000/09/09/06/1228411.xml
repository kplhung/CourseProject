        <p>President Clinton may have deferred the question of whether to build a national missile defense system to his successor, but opponents of such a system are not satisfied. In television advertisements that are to begin running on Wednesday, the nation's largest pro-disarmament group is attacking candidates in 13 competitive House and Senate races who favor a missile shield.</p>
        <p>The four-day ad campaign is the centerpiece of efforts by the group, Peace Action, formerly known as SANE/Freeze, to recover a measure of the political influence it held during the arms race of the early 1980's but quickly lost with the end of the cold war.</p>

        <p>President Clinton may have deferred the question of whether to build a national missile defense system to his successor, but opponents of such a system are not satisfied. In television advertisements that are to begin running on Wednesday, the nation's largest pro-disarmament group is attacking candidates in 13 competitive House and Senate races who favor a missile shield.</p>
        <p>The four-day ad campaign is the centerpiece of efforts by the group, Peace Action, formerly known as SANE/Freeze, to recover a measure of the political influence it held during the arms race of the early 1980's but quickly lost with the end of the cold war.</p>
        <p>The ads are being paid for by the Peace Voter Fund, an entity organized by Peace Action under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code so it could raise money without having to disclose its contributors. It was set up last year with $250,000 in seed money from a handful of wealthy benefactors whom officials of the group refuse to name.</p>
        <p>The ads criticize the positions of the Republican candidates in the 12th Congressional District in New Jersey and in the United States Senate races in New Jersey and New York.</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, Richard A. Zimmer, a Republican who was a congressman in the 12th District from 1991 until 1996, is challenging the freshman incumbent, Rush D. Holt, a Democrat.. Mr. Zimmer favors missile-defense programs, while Mr. Holt, a physicist, is a member of Peace Action's New Jersey affiliate and opposes the programs.</p>
        <p>In the state's Senate contest, the ad is aimed at Representative Robert D. Franks, who is giving up his seat to run for the Senate. He voted in the House this year to deploy a missile defense as soon as it was technically feasible.</p>
        <p>Another version of the ad names Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate for Senate in New York and will run on cable stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Nassau and Suffolk counties, Albany and Syracuse.</p>
        <p>The commercials, which will run on CNN during prime time through Saturday, zero in on what critics say is a crucial shortcoming in antimissile technology. They show a balloon with a smiling face floating skyward as a female announcer intones, ''This is a Mylar balloon. It is not a nuclear warhead. Trouble is, the Star Wars missile system the Pentagon is pushing can't tell the difference. In fact, top scientists say the Star Wars technology is fatally flawed and easily fooled. Fifty Nobel Prize winners warn it will start a new arms race.''</p>
        <p>The announcer urges viewers to call the specific candidate mentioned and tell him or her ''to come down to Earth, to stop wasting our money on Star Wars and invest that money instead in our children's schools and our parents' health care.''</p>
        <p>Frank J. Gaffney Jr., a leading proponent of a national missile defense who heads the Center for Security Policy in Washington, called the ads misleading but said he welcomed ''anything that can be done to help bring the issue of America's vulnerability to missile attack to the attention of the American people.''</p>
        <p>Van Gosse, an official with Peace Action, said the group had nearly 200,000 paid members at its peak in the late 1980's. With about 70,000 members now, it seeks to regain the level of influence that it held in 1984, when Walter F. Mondale endorsed a nuclear freeze during his presidential run.</p>
        <p>''We're not in this to defeat or elect anybody,'' Mr. Gosse said. ''We're in this to make all of them pay attention to us, to understand that this is a constituency that is capable of being politically active. Can you imagine any political force being taken seriously today if it didn't run ads?''</p>
        <p>Nationally, the ads are mostly aimed at Republicans, including Senators Spencer Abraham of Michigan, John Ashcroft of Missouri, Slade Gorton of Washington, Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Representatives Charlie Bass of New Hampshire, Connie Morella of Maryland and Jim Rogan of California.</p>
