        <p>Leaning back in his seat, coffee in hand, Gregory Schmidt was savoring the ride on the first day of a long-awaited ferry service for Manhattan-bound commuters. No more traffic jams. No parking hassles. And best of all, no Tappan Zee Bridge.</p>
        <p>''It's just one big parking lot,'' said Mr. Schmidt, 29, a liquor salesman from Garnerville, as he pointed out the silvery bridge in the distance. ''That's the dreaded bridge now. I can see the cars sitting at the toll booths. So long, suckers.''</p>

        <p>Leaning back in his seat, coffee in hand, Gregory Schmidt was savoring the ride on the first day of a long-awaited ferry service for Manhattan-bound commuters. No more traffic jams. No parking hassles. And best of all, no Tappan Zee Bridge.</p>
        <p>''It's just one big parking lot,'' said Mr. Schmidt, 29, a liquor salesman from Garnerville, as he pointed out the silvery bridge in the distance. ''That's the dreaded bridge now. I can see the cars sitting at the toll booths. So long, suckers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt was one of 77 commuters who left their car keys at home this morning to try out a new ferry that connects Rockland and Westchester Counties across the Hudson River. The ferry departs from here, on the Rockland side of the river, four times every weekday morning for the 25-minute ride east to Ossining, where passengers can board Metro-North express trains for the 45-minute trip to Grand Central Terminal. (There are no direct trains from Rockland.) The ferry also makes four return trips in the evenings.</p>
        <p>The ferry service, a partnership between New York Waterway and Metro-North Railroad, is one of several measures taken by state transportation officials to accommodate commuters and alleviate congestion in this fast-developing region. A state task force has advocated replacing the aging Tappan Zee with a wider, $4 billion bridge and rail system. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has also pledged $41 million during the next five years to improve train service west of the Hudson.</p>
        <p>This week, the ferry service is offering free rides to encourage local residents to climb aboard the 98-foot-long, 90-ton John Jay, named after the nation's first chief justice. It will usually cost $3 each way for an adult, with a combined ferry-train ticket  available for $193 a month. The service is being subsidized with $2 million in state and federal grants during the next two years.</p>
        <p>Despite chilly winds and gray skies, 15 eager commuters started arriving here around 4:30 today to catch the first crossing at 5:05 a.m., which was followed by others at 6:19, 7:17 and 8:41 a.m. The biggest crowd all morning was for the 7:17 ferry, though those 39 commuters left plenty of room on the 149-seat boat.</p>
        <p>At the station, they huddled in three partly enclosed glass shelters, and warmed themselves with coffee and doughnuts from a snack stand strategically placed next to the ticket window.</p>
        <p>''I've got to get used to this new commute,'' said Roy Hansen, 49, an information systems director from Haverstraw, as he reached for a cup of steaming coffee. ''But I like it already, if that's what you're asking.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hansen, neatly dressed in a black suit, said he had been waiting since the early 1990's for a ferry service that would shorten his daily two-hour car trip. ''Of course, I wanted a direct ferry to Midtown, like a high-speed catamaran,'' he said. ''But I'm still happy. I've been commuting for 15 years, and it's always been an issue, something to worry about. I think this is a great start.''</p>
        <p>As the trim blue-and-white ferry pulled up next to the dock, passengers filed down an L-shaped aluminum gangway. Two ferry workers helped them aboard as officials with New York Waterway and Metro-North made sure that everything went smoothly. At exactly 7:17, the ferry eased into the river and cruised along at 22 knots. Twenty-five minutes later, it arrived on the other side.</p>
        <p>Capt. Mark Summers, at the wheel, said there had been no problems so far, and only one delay of three minutes after he returned to the dock for a passenger who arrived after the ferry had pulled away. (He  made up the time during the crossing.) To make sure that the ferry started on time, he even slept on board last night, curling his 6-foot-2 frame into a row of seats.</p>
        <p>''I knew the ferry would start, but I wasn't so sure about my car,'' said Captain Summers, who lives an hour and 45 minutes away in Bayonne, N.J.</p>
        <p>Most of the passengers stayed in a heated indoor cabin with vinyl blue booths and wooden tables covered with nautical maps. Glenn Kaufman, 33, a financial analyst who lives in New City, gazed out the window at the Hudson River rolling by, and discussed the merits of the ferry versus the bus with another passenger, Ellen Ford, who sat beside him.</p>
        <p>''When you have a pleasant ride across,'' he said, ''it makes you actually forget you're going to work.''</p>
        <p>Will he become a regular? Yes, though he hoped that the ferry would  expand its service to include more frequent departures. ''Right now, you really have to time it well,'' he said. ''If you miss that, too bad, and I get lazy sometimes.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ford, 52, a textbook editor from Garnerville, nodded in agreement. ''If you work even five minutes late, you have to wait another hour,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Daniel O'Connell, assistant marketing director for Metro-North, said later that transportation officials would consider adding more departures and operating the ferry on weekends if there were enough passengers. ''If the ridership increases, we'll expand the service,'' said Mr. O'Connell, who also rode the ferry this morning.</p>
        <p>As the sun came out, several passengers ventured upstairs to the open deck for lovely views of rocky cliffs and bobbing sailboats on the horizon. Ronald Turner, 40, an insurance agent from Haverstraw, brought along his camera and asked another passenger to take his picture.</p>
        <p>''Hey, this is a Kodak moment,'' Mr. Turner said. ''It's the first day, and I figure, this is my opportunity to try it. So far, I like it. I think it's very nice.''</p>
