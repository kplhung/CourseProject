        <p>IT took a few twists and turns before Kurt Gutenbrunner found his way back to Austria. He intended to take the direct route, moving from Bouley, where he served as sous chef for five years, to the post of executive chef at Danube, David Bouley's ambitious, bejeweled shrine to the cooking of Austria-Hungary. When the project stalled, however, Mr. Gutenbrunner became restless and left. He took over the kitchen at Monkey Bar, putting a Viennese spin on the menu that never felt quite right, given the restaurant's roots in the New York of the 1930's and 40's. Now he has found a new setting in Wallse, a corner restaurant in the far West Village that he has turned into a modest showcase for the Austrian cooking he grew up with.</p>
        <p>The Bouley-Gutenbrunner split works out very nicely for New York diners, who can now take their Austria deluxe, or in the relaxed, homey version offered at Wallse.

The decor is chaste, with white walls, black banquettes and black chairs that have just the hint of an Art Nouveau wiggle in their design and a jolt of unexpected color on their neon-yellow and red seats. A single mauve calla lily at the center of each table, illuminated by a small candle in a silver mesh box, strikes an exotic note.</p>

        <p>IT took a few twists and turns before Kurt Gutenbrunner found his way back to Austria. He intended to take the direct route, moving from Bouley, where he served as sous chef for five years, to the post of executive chef at Danube, David Bouley's ambitious, bejeweled shrine to the cooking of Austria-Hungary. When the project stalled, however, Mr. Gutenbrunner became restless and left. He took over the kitchen at Monkey Bar, putting a Viennese spin on the menu that never felt quite right, given the restaurant's roots in the New York of the 1930's and 40's. Now he has found a new setting in Wallse, a corner restaurant in the far West Village that he has turned into a modest showcase for the Austrian cooking he grew up with.</p>
        <p>The Bouley-Gutenbrunner split works out very nicely for New York diners, who can now take their Austria deluxe, or in the relaxed, homey version offered at Wallse. (The name comes from Wallsee, Mr. Gutenbrunner's hometown, with a Frenchified spelling to make it easier to pronounce: it's VAHL-zay.) The decor is chaste, with white walls, black banquettes and black chairs that have just the hint of an Art Nouveau wiggle in their design and a jolt of unexpected color on their neon-yellow and red seats. A single mauve calla lily at the center of each table, illuminated by a small candle in a silver mesh box, strikes an exotic note.</p>
        <p>The menu and the wine list seem perfectly suited to what is, in effect, a glorified neighborhood restaurant. Mr. Gutenbrunner keeps his rather short list of dishes relatively simple, but within his self-imposed limits, he achieves splendid results. A light, elegant riesling sauce adds distinction to a straightforward salad of asparagus and chanterelles, and a similarly light touch with horseradish cream makes a salad of smoked trout and eel a highlight on the menu. The trout's pungent, smoky tang and very firm texture perfectly complement the soft, unctuous eel, with a heap of watercress freshening each bite.</p>
        <p>Again and again, Mr. Gutenbrunner hits on a happy idea that elevates his down-home Austrian sources. The result is a highly personal style that qualifies as high bistro. Yellow pike, its skin seared to a thick crackle, comes laden with thick strips of lightly marinated green and yellow squash accented with lemon thyme. Viennese rostbraten, a workaday sort of dish based on sirloin in a sweet and sour vinegar and wine sauce, would look ridiculous putting on airs. Instead, Mr. Guttenbrunner has paired it with a hearty kohlrabi gratin, a multilayer affair with sheets of slick, firm root vegetable (it squeaks when you chew it) alternating with thick cream, cheese and onion. Wiener schnitzel at Wallse is nothing more than Wiener schnitzel, but it comes with butter-coated, waxy-textured parsley potatoes, each the shape and size of a perfect quail's egg. Halibut, which wins my vote as the most consistent underachiever among fish, takes on new allure at Wallse, with an assertive, sharp sauce of cucumber, dill and wild mushrooms.</p>
        <p>Tafelspitz, rather bland slices of boiled beef in a thin broth, perk up with their sharp topping of apple horseradish, and a giant round of potato rosti (hash browns with a German accent) certainly doesn't hurt -- but the ingenious touch here is a reinvented steakhouse staple, creamed spinach, which Mr. Gutenbrunner reinterprets as a velvety puree, thick enough to form peaks.</p>
        <p>Not every dish rises to the occasion. Chilled tomato and red pepper soup, with a crayfish floating in the middle, was searingly vinegary the night I tried it. And nothing can dampen enthusiasm faster than limp spatzle, a leading player at Wallse, where the goulash comes with spatzle made with Austria's mild quark cheese and where sauteed rabbit with peas gets a little heft from herb spatzle. I ordered both on a night when the spatzle came out softer than spaghetti from a can. The experience was doubly disappointing because the rabbit, when the spatzle is cooked right, may be the best appetizer on the menu.</p>
        <p>In most restaurants, you can tell when waiters know they are pushing a winner. At Wallse, the telltale signs (shiny eyes, a ring of conviction in the voice) appear when the dessert menu comes out. On my first visit, the restaurant's exuberant French sommelier stepped into the act, pleading with my table to order the quark dumplings. ''I eat one of these every single night,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If I could, I would, too. Banish every association that ''cheese dumpling'' suggests, and start afresh. In Mr. Gutenbrunner's hands, the combination of quark and flour translates into a feather-light sphere, not too sweet, that melts on the tongue like manna. It comes with fat apricot halves that are roasted and stuffed with red currants. One night the currants came on the branch, and were frosted in sugar.</p>
        <p>The quark dumplings get a run for their money from the chocolate-hazelnut cake, another off-sweet triumph with a texture halfway between a layer cake and a steamed pudding, and a so-called strudel that consists of paper-thin rounds of crisp pastry spread, napoleon style, with pastry cream and plump, fresh berries. It's a much better bet than the restaurant's traditional but not particularly exciting apricot strudel.</p>
        <p>After settling the dessert question, the sommelier had something else to be excited about, the wine list. He is French, the restaurant is Austrian, and somehow the twain meet in an admirably chosen, well-priced list that presents some exciting rieslings and blauburgunders (German for pinot noir), along with wines from local grapes like gruner veltliner and blaufrankisch, and a representative selection of French wines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gutenbrunner may have missed the boat on Danube. But drifting downstream a bit, he has managed a very happy landing. New York never knew it needed Austrian cooking. Now it may not be able to live without it.</p>
