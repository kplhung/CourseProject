        <p>In one hermetically sealed pocket of Manhattan, Nicolas Kiefer spent an unsettling Sunday night in a hotel where guards were eyeing everything but the floor tiles, where security alerts were shaking his sense of safety, and where the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, had taken up residence for the United Nations Millennium Summit.</p>
        <p>How was Kiefer supposed to sleep?</p>
        <p>In a cozy corner of the National Tennis Center, Magnus Norman spent the same steamy Sunday night inside a crammed Grandstand stadium, where he kept shaking out his cramping legs as if they were rumpled bed sheets, where he nearly expired in the fourth hour of his intense third-round match, and where he finally escaped the wingspan of Max Mirnyi to exit intact.</p>
        <p>How was Norman supposed to recover?</p>
        <p>Yesterday, both players arrived for their Round of 16 match on Day 9 of the United States Open in varying states of decay. The 14th-seeded Kiefer was sleep deprived, while the third-seeded Norman was battling fatigue and a sore throat.</p>
        <p>Somehow, there is always something standing in the way of consistency on the men's tour. Instead of stamping himself as a certified star in yet another Grand Slam opportunity to make a bigger name for himself, Norman became another victim of top-seeded extinction at the United States Open once a more aggressive Kiefer put him away, 6-2, 6-7 (3), 6-1, 6-3.</p>
        <p>In an instant, Norman joined the No. 1-seeded Andre Agassi and the No. 2-seeded Gustavo Kuerten in his premature exit. This is the first time since the beginning of the Open Era (1968) that the top three seeded men have failed to outlast the fourth round. And with the quarterfinals set to begin today, only two of the top eight seeded men remain: fourth-seeded Pete Sampras and sixth-seeded Marat Safin. Safin, the affable young Russian, was a 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 winner yesterday over Juan Carlos Ferrero, but only a few spectators were there to witness it in a nearly vacant Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>
        <p>The crowd was only another sign of apathy toward a men's tour struggling to conjure up the star power that has propelled the women's success.</p>
        <p>''I think the spectators, they have some other things to do,'' said Safin, who arrived on the court after Venus Williams exited with a victory and took the fans with her. ''I think if they're not here, they have to be somewhere, no?''</p>
        <p>They weren't around for Norman's struggle, either. He was in trouble from the beginning of his match against Kiefer. Out of sorts, Norman could not keep his ground strokes down in a swirling wind and failed to put a good punch on his volleys. By the time he trailed, 4-1, in the first set, Norman had committed 10 unforced errors, while an under-control Kiefer had just two.</p>
        <p>Only a questionable line call in the second-set tie breaker gave Norman hope. He was down by 3-1 when an apparent ace by Kiefer was overruled. Visibly upset, Kiefer lost a string of six straight points to hand the tie breaker to Norman. That was the last moment of relief for Norman. For the rest of the match, he was unable to control his wild swipes at his forehands, even crushing one short ball against the back wall of the court on the fly.</p>
        <p>Out of answers by the middle of the fourth set, Norman even went to his duffel bag for some psychological help. He pulled out the same Lifesaver-red shirt he wore when he came back from two sets down to beat the mighty Mirnyi late Sunday night.</p>
        <p>''It seems like I'm more on fire when I'm playing with that shirt,'' said Norman, perhaps taking his cue from Tiger Woods's tradition of wearing red on the final day of a tournament. ''Makes me hot, you know?''</p>
        <p>In this case, it did not work. After 59 unforced errors, Norman became just another top man ushered out of the tournament. He had hoped for much more. So had the marketing department of the men's tour. Officials were looking to launch their photogenic young phenoms (about a dozen of them, it seemed) into the American consciousness during the United States Open. But only Safin and ninth-seeded Lleyton Hewitt remain. Unseeded Arnaud Clement and Thomas Johansson, who also won his fourth-round match yesterday, are also in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>During this shakeout of the top, Sampras remains as the one steady name at the top of an increasingly homogeneous group trying to string together two good months in a row. At times, Sampras, long removed from making a No. 1 ranking his top priority, has wondered if the up-and-coming players have the attention spans to be consistent.</p>
        <p>Right now, no one has stepped forward to dominate. While Norman has occupied the No. 1 ranking at times, and won five tour titles last year, he has yet to become a household name by winning a major.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, it will be a great help,'' Norman said. ''You know, I'm  a little tired of answering that question about my status.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Norman was weary on the court, as well. He admitted he had enough energy even after battling Mirnyi, but the sore throat that began creeping up on him Monday night did not help. He said he had trouble with the wind and chill, but his mind was not as focused as it could have been during the match.</p>
        <p>''Today my rhythm wasn't there,'' Norman said. ''My head wasn't really there. My body wasn't really there. But he didn't make it easy for me either.''</p>
        <p>A livelier Kiefer fought through his fatigue. He was the one with the crisper ground strokes and snappier footwork. On this occasion, he was able to handle his ordeal a little better than Norman.</p>
        <p>''I had a bad night,'' said Kiefer, who switched hotels Monday morning. ''It was only stress for me. I couldn't relax one minute.''</p>
        <p>Nothing is ever easy in the men's draw. Thus far, none of the women have complained about the various locations of their accommodations. In fact, when Williams was told of Kiefer's tribulations in the neighborhood of the United Nations, she sighed and said, ''That's a bad choice.''</p>
