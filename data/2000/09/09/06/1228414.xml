        <p>Lawyers for the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee filed a brief today with the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver urging that it reject as disingenuous government arguments against granting bail to Dr. Lee, because prosecutors had shaped many of the terms of his proposed home detention.</p>

        <p>Lawyers for the former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee filed a brief today with the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver urging that it reject as disingenuous government arguments against granting bail to Dr. Lee, because prosecutors had shaped many of the terms of his proposed home detention.</p>
        <p>In an earlier motion, prosecutors had said the conditions for granting bail were inadequate, since they still would not prevent him from using his wife to spirit nuclear secrets to a hostile power. Under those conditions she would be allowed to come and go, with permission, from their house.</p>
        <p>In its motion today, the defense argued that since the government itself had proposed some of the more stringent terms of Dr. Lee's home detention, like the placement of video cameras in his garden, it could not now say those terms were inadequate.</p>
        <p>The trial judge handling the case, James A. Parker of Federal District Court in Albuquerque, issued an order on Aug. 24, saying he had decided that Dr. Lee, who is charged with illegally downloading a large number of nuclear weapons secrets while at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, should be released to a strict form of home detention on $1 million bail. Judge Parker's order reversed his ruling of last December, when he agreed with the government that Dr. Lee posed such a threat to national security that he had to be jailed until his trial, scheduled for November.</p>
        <p>But in a confusing twist, the judge raised questions about whether his written decision granting bail had been improperly made public. Last Thursday, Judge Parker wrote a new 17-page opinion, stating why he had changed his mind, and it was filed with the court that day. But it was placed under seal so government officials could determine if it contained classified information.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend the new opinion became public when it was included with a motion filed by the United States attorney in Albuquerque seeking an appeal of the bail decision. Once prosecutors filed their appeal, they handed the order to defense attorneys and said it was now public, and it was distributed.</p>
        <p>In describing his order's becoming public, Judge Parker said today that he did not believe anyone intended to violate his order but added that he was concerned because his written opinion had slipped out in a way that seemed contrary to his aim of distributing his orders more straightforwardly.</p>
        <p>''I don't think there were bad intentions on anyone's part,'' he said. But, he added, ''I honestly don't know the status of it now.''</p>
        <p>Classifiers at the Department of Energy apparently reviewed the document, deleted a few details and gave it to the United States attorney on Friday.</p>
        <p>The United States attorney then attached the opinion, which pokes numerous holes in the government's case, to its emergency appeal.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lee remains in prison pending the appeal.</p>
        <p>The judge's decision has still not been posted on the federal court's official Web site or released at the courthouse. Patricia Chavez, the spokeswoman for the United States  attorney, said the office would have no comment.</p>
        <p>The opinion is important in part because it casts deep doubts about many of the government's assertions about Dr. Lee's supposed deceptiveness and the value of the secrets he is accused of downloading, issues at the heart of the prosecution's case.</p>
        <p>''The totality of the information of which I now have knowledge presents a tableau different from that described by the government last December,'' the judge wrote. ''Instead of being confined, as it was then, to an umbral area of pitch-black darkness, the relevant information has shifted to a penumbral region that is a somewhat mottled shade of gray.''</p>
        <p>Originally, government witnesses had testified that Dr. Lee had downloaded the ''crown jewels'' of the United States' weapons program, but in his order Judge Parker said that new information presented at the latest bail hearing demonstrated that the information ''no longer is so clearly deserving of that label.'' He pointedly quoted a defense expert who called the government's assertions ''unbridled exaggeration.''</p>
        <p>The judge said he was still concerned about some of Dr. Lee's actions, particularly a meeting in a Beijing hotel room in 1988 with two senior Chinese nuclear weapons scientists that was not fully disclosed to the government for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>But Judge Parker said he now either had dismissed many of the government's other claims about Dr. Lee's alleged deceptions or had grave doubts about them. For instance, he said, he had been most influenced by an F.B.I. agent's testimony in December that Dr. Lee had lied to a colleague to gain access to a computer he needed to download the secret data. That agent, Robert Messemer, admitted in court several weeks ago that Dr. Lee had not lied.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker also noted that Mr. Messemer had testified earlier that he anticipated that there would be a sharp increase in efforts by enemy agents to find seven missing computer tapes on which Dr. Lee had placed much of data he improperly downloaded. In the latest hearing, Mr. Messemer conceded that no such activity had materialized.</p>
        <p>The judge also wrote that he had changed his mind about granting bail because of the government's new charge that Dr. Lee had committed the acts not because he was spying but in an effort to help him get a job at some foreign scientific institutes, most in countries like Australia, Singapore and Switzerland.</p>
        <p>''Enhancing one's resume,'' Judge Parker wrote, ''is less sinister than the treacherous motive the government, at least by implication, ascribed to Dr. Lee at the end of last year.''</p>
        <p>He also wrote that Dr. Lee had not only done little to conceal his downloading, and also knew full well that there were monitoring systems that would detect what he was doing. At one point when he was trying to erase some files, however, Dr. Lee called an open help line at the laboratory to seek assistance.</p>
        <p>''This suggests that Dr. Lee's actions may not have been as surreptitious, clandestine, and secretive as the government originally indicated,'' Judge Parker wrote.</p>
        <p>And in a long footnote, he expressed anger that the government ''seems to have procrastinated in removing unduly onerous conditions of confinement'' that he had asked be eased at the beginning of this year.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker described some of the conditions as ''demeaning.''</p>
        <p>He noted, however, that, more than eight months later, the conditions have been improved, and he assured the government that his dismay over the slow response had not colored his decision to free Dr. Lee on bail.</p>
