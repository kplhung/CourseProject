        <p>The West Indian American Carnival Parade, held in Crown Heights each year on Labor Day, has long attracted its share of public drinkers. So when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Police Department announced last month that they were banning alcohol sales and drinking at city parades, they  expected to catch a few offenders.</p>
        <p>They were right. In all, 87 people were issued summonses for drinking alcohol in public. But the authorities could hardly have expected this: two veteran police officers, assigned to watch over the parade and enforce the alcohol ban, were caught sneaking drinks as well.</p>

        <p>The West Indian American Carnival Parade, held in Crown Heights each year on Labor Day, has long attracted its share of public drinkers. So when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Police Department announced last month that they were banning alcohol sales and drinking at city parades, they  expected to catch a few offenders.</p>
        <p>They were right. In all, 87 people were issued summonses for drinking alcohol in public. But the authorities could hardly have expected this: two veteran police officers, assigned to watch over the parade and enforce the alcohol ban, were caught sneaking drinks as well.</p>
        <p>The officers -- Anthony Zayas, 36, and Kevin Kryzak, 39 -- were suspended without pay yesterday after being caught with open bottles of beer, the police said. The suspensions come after Mr. Giuliani was pilloried and booed at the parade by revelers and vendors opposed to the ban.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the two officers reported to work at 6:40 a.m. Monday. After a long day, a sergeant who was supervising them thought he smelled alcohol on their breath about 9:30 p.m., the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The sergeant followed them as they walked into the Rodriguez Grocery Store at 1478 Bedford Avenue in Crown Heights, and when he caught up with them inside the store, he found each man holding a half-full bottle of beer, said Lt. Sean Crowley, a police spokesman. Both officers were in uniform.</p>
        <p>Jose Rodriguez, a cashier at the grocery store, which is owned by his brother, said he had been at the counter when the officers were caught. He said police officers often visited the store.</p>
        <p>''A lot of police officers ask me if they can come in and go to the bathroom,'' he said. ''So I say, 'O.K., it's in the back.' But I didn't know these two were drinking. It was busy. I didn't have time to go back and see.''</p>
        <p>The police said the officers were found with three empty bottles of beer but were not believed to have been intoxicated. ''It appears only five beers were involved with the two men,'' a police official said.</p>
        <p>The officers were charged with consuming alcohol in uniform, a violation of Police Department regulations. Both have been members of the department since the mid-1980's, and are normally assigned to patrol duties in the 44th Precinct in Morris Heights, the Bronx.</p>
