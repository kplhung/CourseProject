        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Founders and the Torah,'' by Michael Novak (Op-Ed, Sept. 4):</p>
        <p>Mr. Novak laments that ''historians, political theorists and lawyers pay far too much attention to the least religious founders, like Jefferson.'' So much for the author of the Declaration of Independence and his view, often repeated by the Supreme Court, that the First Amendment erected ''a wall of separation between Church and State.''</p>
        <p>Is James Madison, the draftsman of the Constitution, to be similarly dismissed? The author of the Virginia ''Memorial and Remonstrance'' opposing any tax levy for the established church was also less ''religious'' than may make Mr. Novak comfortable.</p>
        <p>But surely Mr. Novak asks the wrong question. We turn to Jefferson and Madison for guidance not because of the degree of their religiosity but because of the dominant roles they played in the founding of our country and the continuing centrality of their writings to the resolution of contemporary problems.</p>
        <p>FLOYD ABRAMS  New York, Sept. 4, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a constitutional lawyer.</p>
