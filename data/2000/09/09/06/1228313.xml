      <abstract>
        <p>Geoffrey Forden Op-Ed article on the danger posed by Russia's crumbling early-warning satellites, which could fail and permit an accidental launch of its nuclear weapons; says US should spend $160 million to help launch five Russian early-warning satellites that are ready to go but languishing on the ground for lack of resources; says US should also make a firm commitment to financing joint research with Russian into new, less costly satellite missile sensors that Russia could more easily afford</p>

        <p>Now that decisions on deploying a missile defense system will be put off until at least early next year, it's time to deal with a less sweeping but more immediate life-and-death issue: the crumbling of satellites that can prevent accidental launches of Russia's nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>For a picture of what these satellites are intended to do, consider a famous near-disaster on the American side in 1979. A training tape simulating a massive Soviet nuclear attack was accidentally run on the computers of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Everyone thought it was real, and crews prepared to launch American missiles in retaliation. What stopped them were our early-warning satellites, which showed there were no Soviet missiles in the air.</p>

        <p>Now that decisions on deploying a missile defense system will be put off until at least early next year, it's time to deal with a less sweeping but more immediate life-and-death issue: the crumbling of satellites that can prevent accidental launches of Russia's nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>For a picture of what these satellites are intended to do, consider a famous near-disaster on the American side in 1979. A training tape simulating a massive Soviet nuclear attack was accidentally run on the computers of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Everyone thought it was real, and crews prepared to launch American missiles in retaliation. What stopped them were our early-warning satellites, which showed there were no Soviet missiles in the air.</p>
        <p>On at least two other occasions, once each in the United States and Russia, space-based sensors played the same lifesaving role after other systems sent mistaken warnings.</p>
        <p>Russia and the United States still have thousands of missiles ready to launch at each other on a few minutes' notice. American leaders still have satellite warning systems to prevent accidental launches when other systems give false warnings.  But most of Russia's early-warning satellites have stopped functioning or wandered out of their assigned orbits.</p>
        <p>In 1995, when the Russian system was still in good repair, some Russian military people misinterpreted a NASA research rocket as an attack designed to blind their radars to incoming American missiles. Fortunately, their satellite warning system, still providing 24-hour space-based surveillance of American missile fields, showed them they were wrong.</p>
        <p>Satellites and sensing devices are expensive and technically complex, and they need regular maintenance and replacement. Russian factories that produced the parts have closed, and scientists who know how to work with the systems have been forced to seek other jobs. Clearly, it's in the American interest to step in.</p>
        <p>The United States should immediately spend about $160 million to get five Russian early-warning satellites -- ready to go but languishing on the ground -- into space. Next, we should make a firm commitment to financing joint research with Russia into new, less costly satellite missile sensors that Russia could more easily afford. The Clinton administration has tied its backing to demands for Russian concessions on missile defense.</p>
        <p>Getting Russian satellites functioning would be far more effective than a joint early-warning center in Moscow that was also proposed by the Clinton administration. At this center, American and Russian military personnel would sit side by side, looking at computer screens displaying the data from their own early-warning systems but free to look over each other's shoulders. If Russia suspected the United States was launching a missile attack, would its leaders really believe American computer screens that did not show it?</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether a missile defense is eventually approved, the relatively inexpensive safety systems needed to prevent a mistaken attack from Russia's still powerful missile force cannot be allowed to fail.</p>
