        <p>Here at The New York Times, we were exceedingly dismayed at the news that George W. Bush had called our redoubtable reporter Adam Clymer ''a major-league (expletive deleted).''</p>
        <p>It caused quite a tizzy. How could we cope with that sort of insult?</p>
        <p>By midday yesterday we had searched our hearts and come to grips with the delicate problem.</p>
        <p>Al Siegal, our estimable arbiter of language, sent a memo to the editors on the political desk: ''Folks: If we have to refer to it again, let's call Bush's word a vulgarity, not an obscenity. It has nothing to do with sex. Nor is it profane, having nothing to do with religion or the deity.''</p>
        <p>Many people find reporters more worthy of censure than auto mechanics. But at least in the old days, pols insulted journalists with flair: We were pusillanimous pussyfooters. Or nattering nabobs of negativism. We were elevated to an Enemies List. Now W. reduces us to an uninspired vulgarity, a mere aside employed in some puerile display of male bonding with ''Big Time'' Dick Cheney.</p>
        <p>The Bushes have a fractious relationship with reporters because they have a bedrock belief in their own goodness. So they get deeply offended when reporters challenge their deeds, rather than simply accepting them as nice, decent people bred to rule.</p>
        <p>That's why they failed to fathom press criticism of Mr. Cheney for his nihilistic voting record on apartheid and Head Start. W.'s baptism into Washington politics in '88 was not based in policy; it was to make sure the Bush campaign was responsive to those who had been, in Junior's favorite phrase, ''loyal to all Bushes.''</p>
        <p>Dick Cheney was loyal to all Bushes. That was the only litmus test that mattered to them.</p>
        <p>Journalists are not in a position to be loyal to all Bushes. W. was angry at Adam Clymer for an article in April reporting on Texas's abysmal health care record, and for a piece last week that rated the accuracy of a new Republican ad on prescription drugs ''zero'' on its central claim.</p>
        <p>W.'s comment came before the reporter he denigrated had had a chance to carry out his Monday assignment -- asking Mr. Cheney why he had given such a piddling amount of his oil windfall to charity.</p>
        <p>The really troubling part of W.'s epithet was not the noun we are not allowed to print. The Bushes always resort to a little oil-riggers' swagger when they feel threatened. As in the father's ''kick a little (expletive deleted)'' line after his debate with Geraldine Ferraro. The Skull &amp; Bones men feel more manly when they can play beef jerkies, crabbing about Harvard types from elitist, liberal institutions.</p>
        <p>Heaven forbid that anyone think the Bushies are just flighty preppies thriving on name and connections, looking for a splash more coffee.</p>
        <p>No, the really troubling part about the epithet was the adjective we are allowed to print: ''major-league.''</p>
        <p>That conjured up the old W. that his handlers keep trying to hide, the inner frat boy, the undisciplined and vindictive smart aleck.</p>
        <p>As a friend of mine put it, it's Deke terminology: ''We're scoring a two-kegger with the Tri-Delts. There'll be some major-league drinkage and some totally awesome babe-age. Be there, Dubya, and score some treats.''</p>
        <p>President Smirk can't get elected. If W. is not mature enough to hold his tongue around an open microphone during the big kickoff day in a week when he desperately needs to turn things around, how do we know he won't get up to his old frat pranks in the Oval Office, chasing world leaders around bilaterals, trying to brand them with hot metal coat hangers?</p>
        <p>W. has built his whole campaign on that famous Bush breeding. As Dick Armey recently told The L.A. Times, ''George Bush is going to demonstrate a new axiom: Good manners make good politics.''</p>
        <p>Since W. cannot argue that the country isn't thriving, he is running on a promise to restore civility and bring a new tone of collegiality.</p>
        <p>After his insult was broadcast Monday, the candidate of manners refused to apologize. His campaign bragged that he was just delivering what he promised: ''plain speaking.''</p>
        <p>W. is at his least appealing when he's down. He's only lucky that Al Gore is at his least appealing when he's up. The vice president is letting that supercilious tone creep back.</p>
        <p>Before W. makes any more snide cracks about the major leagues, he should remember he's in them.</p>
