        <p>Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to redesign Medicare and offer drug benefits to the elderly puts him squarely in line with his party's drive to reshape the program by reducing the role of government, increasing the role of insurance companies and giving elderly people more choices.</p>
        <p>The proposal is also meant to serve an important political purpose: to fend off attacks by Democrats who contend that Mr. Bush has no true commitment to elderly people squeezed by rising drug costs. The elderly, long a key part of the Democratic coalition, are considered a crucial swing vote this year.</p>
        <p>Like most Democrats, Mr. Gore sees Medicare as one of the greatest achievements of American social policy and basically approves of the course it has followed since its creation 35 years ago. Mr. Bush, by contrast, sees Medicare as a prime example of government regulation run wild.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore offers a uniform, standardized package of benefits with the same premiums for most beneficiaries. Mr. Bush would subsidize a variety of health plans offering different drug benefits and charging different premiums and co-payments.</p>
        <p>On the surface, Mr. Gore's plan appears to offer more certainty, more security and more generous benefits. But the total cost to the government would be higher, and the Bush campaign asserted that under Mr. Gore's proposal ''half of all seniors will pay more in annual charges than they will receive in prescription drug benefits.''</p>
        <p>And with his proposal today, which he outlined in a speech in Pennsylvania, Mr. Bush has set the stage for a reprise of the health care battles of the last decade, revolving around a fundamental question: which do voters fear more, the government or the insurance industry?</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush wants to make greater use of private industry, including insurers and health maintenance organizations, to deliver drug benefits and other medical services to the elderly. The government would still pay most costs, though, and would supervise insurers, approving or disapproving all plans. In essence, Mr. Bush envisions a large expansion of the role of H.M.O.'s, which now cover 6.2 million of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Relying on private health plans carries some risk, given the recent experience of many Medicare beneficiaries. In the last two years, H.M.O.'s have dropped hundreds of thousands of elderly beneficiaries, saying the government did not pay enough for their coverage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's approach relies more on the traditional Medicare program to deliver drug benefits.</p>
        <p>Both candidates agree that drug benefits should be voluntary -- an option available for an extra charge.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Bush's proposal, the government would pay at least 25 percent of the cost of premiums for drug coverage, even for the most affluent beneficiaries. Under Mr. Gore's proposal, the government would pay at least 50 percent.</p>
        <p>While both proposals would offer some assistance with drug costs to all beneficiaries, neither would relieve the elderly of the total cost.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's plan, the government would pay all pharmaceutical costs after a beneficiary had spent $4,000 out-of-pocket on drugs in a year. Mr. Bush says that under his proposal, the government would pick up all costs after a beneficiary had spent $6,000 on health care of all types. Both plans would subsidize part of the cost of prescription drug insurance for people who elect it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would pump much more money into Medicare and drug benefits for the elderly in the coming decade. But Mr. Bush's plan would cost far more than a bill passed by the House in June to offer drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush says his plan would offer assistance quickly because he would offer money to the states -- $12 billion a year for four years -- to provide immediate assistance to people with low incomes.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, described the difference this way: ''Governor Bush would provide seniors with options and choices. Vice President Gore focuses on a one-size-fits-all solution to the need for drug benefits.''</p>
        <p>Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, described the Gore plan's uniformity of premiums and benefits as a virtue. ''Under the Bush plan, there would be wide variations across country,'' she said, serving as spokeswoman for the Gore campaign. ''It simply is not a Medicare benefit. It's not available to everyone in every part of the country at the same price.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Dr. Shalala argued, ''George Bush suggests seniors have a big problem with the bureaucracy of the Health Care Financing Administration,'' the agency that runs Medicare. ''What they really have a problem with is the bureaucracy of H.M.O.'s.''</p>
        <p>It is difficult to compare the Bush and Gore proposals. Mr. Bush would encourage Medicare beneficiaries to obtain drug coverage and other services through private health plans subsidized by the government. Mr. Bush did not specify the level of drug benefits that would be available under his proposal, nor did he specify the premiums and co-payments for which the elderly would be responsible. Those amounts could vary from one plan to another, he said.</p>
        <p>By contrast, under Mr. Gore's proposal, the government would specify a standardized package of benefits. Medicare would pay half the cost of each prescription, with no deductible. The maximum federal payment would be $1,000 for $2,000 of drugs in 2002, rising to $2,500 for $5,000 of drugs in 2008. Monthly premiums would start at $25 in 2002 and would rise to nearly $51 in 2009.</p>
        <p>A summary of Mr. Bush's plan, issued by his campaign, indicates that drug benefits would be offered to Medicare recipients in the original fee-for-service program, as well as to those in H.M.O.'s. All health insurers in Medicare, including government-sponsored plans, ''will have to offer an expanded benefit package, including outpatient prescription drug coverage,'' the document says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleischer said that under the Bush plan, ''the existing standard Medicare benefit package would be expanded for the first time to provide prescription drugs for those who remain in the fee-for-service program. You would not have to leave Medicare to get prescription drug benefits. But you would be free to shop around, choose and compare.''</p>
        <p>The plan was praised by insurance executives. Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, said, ''It's a serious proposal that will help make prescription drugs more affordable for those most in need.''</p>
        <p>Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, which represents H.M.O.'s, said her industry could ''play a role, definitely, in delivering this benefit.''</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates and Democrats were just as quick to criticize the Bush plan. Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group, said the record of H.M.O.'s and other private insurers in delivering drug coverage to the elderly was ''at best, spotty.''</p>
        <p>Of the broader market-oriented changes contemplated by Governor Bush, Mr. Pollack said, ''We fear that this would wither away the fee-for-service system that five out of six seniors depend on today.''</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Bush's plan achieves its political purpose may depend less on its specific details than on how skillfully he marshals facts, figures and arguments in support of it -- in televised debates and in his ads.</p>
        <p>Prescription drugs loom large politically because they are a top concern of critical constituencies -- the elderly, and the generation aging just behind them. Republican strategists said that Mr. Bush's plan would change the debate, which had taken a toll in recent weeks on his support among older women.</p>
        <p>Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who also works for the drug industry, said: ''Now, there's a legitimate debate about which plan is better. That's a very different debate, with significant merits on the side of what Governor Bush has introduced.''</p>
        <p>But Democrats argued that Mr. Bush's plan had huge vulnerabilities.  The private sector marketplace that Mr. Bush envisions, Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, said, was ''an abstraction and an unknown quantity that provides no comfort or reassurance to seniors.''</p>
