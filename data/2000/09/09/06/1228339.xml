        <p>MORE and more, the password in sports is ''stadium.'' If a franchise doesn't have a new or renovated stadium or arena, it wants one. The Yankees and the Mets do.

        <p>MORE and more, the password in sports is ''stadium.'' If a franchise doesn't have a new or renovated stadium or arena, it wants one. The Yankees and the Mets do. The Jets and the Islanders do. The Devils and the Nets want to share one. There has even been talk of a new Madison Square Garden for the Knicks and the Rangers. New ballparks opened this year in Detroit, San Francisco and Houston; another will open next year in Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Even in Green Bay, Wis., the talk isn't so much about the Packers as it is about next Tuesday's county referendum on financing more than half of the club's proposed $295 million renovation of Lambeau Field for the 2003 season.</p>
        <p>But voters' approval of a half-cent sales tax is as up in the air as a field-goal kick.</p>
        <p>''It's very tight; it could go either way,'' said Bob Harlan, the Packers' chief executive officer, referring to local polls and surveys. ''The word 'tax' bothers some people, even though the state fiscal committee has estimated it would cost the average citizen about 13 cents a day, about $46 a year.''</p>
        <p>The renovation proposal, to which the publicly owned Packers would contribute $126 million, would give 43-year-old Lambeau Field a retro facelift: outside red brick walls with green accents and glass; a five-story atrium with a stadium club; and 10,000 additional seats for a capacity of 71,000, including 4,000 single-game tickets.</p>
        <p>But part of the Packers' contribution would come from one-time seat-user fees ($1,400 for those with a seven-game season package, $600 for those with a three-game package).</p>
        <p>Every so often during the Jets' 20-16 victory there last Sunday, the scoreboard reminded, ''Vote Yes on Sept. 12.'' One bedsheet banner implored: ''Save Our Stadium. Vote Yes.'' Another pleaded: ''Save Our Lambeau Field. Vote Yes.'' In a Sunday editorial, The Green Bay Press-Gazette also urged its readers to vote yes.</p>
        <p>You wouldn't think a ''Yes'' campaign would be necessary in an area with the National Football League's deepest roots.</p>
        <p>The Green Bay Packers were organized in 1919, a year before the N.F.L. was formed. With a record 12 championships, the Packers are the Yankees of pro football; the Chicago Bears are next with 9; the Giants third with 6. Because of the N.F.L.'s willingness to share network television income equally among its franchises, the Packers have endured in a Wisconsin town with a population of slightly more than 100,000.</p>
        <p>But even with a salary cap, an N.F.L. club's roots are only as deep as its cash flow. And the Packers' argument for the Lambeau Field renovation is that they need what is called ''stadium income.''</p>
        <p>''If the referendum passes, our stadium income would increase by anywhere from $23 million to $30 million annually,'' Harlan said. ''If it is turned down, we would have to go back to the city, which owns the stadium, to work out another plan. We can't move the franchise, but we could die if we got to the point where the N.F.L. didn't want us.''</p>
        <p>Of the 11 other N.F.L. stadium-related referendums in recent years, two were rejected, in Pittsburgh and Arizona. But a new stadium in Pittsburgh is being built with a revised plan. Arizona voters will vote on a new referendum in November.</p>
        <p>For all of Lambeau Field's sellouts, for all the area's devotion to the Packer legend, not everybody is a Packer Backer. Green Bay is a conservative, blue-collar area where some people resent ''taxation without representation,'' the words that fostered the Declaration of Independence. Even when the tax would help the Packers.</p>
        <p>Some voters just don't care if Lambeau Field is renovated. They don't go to the games anyway. Even those who would like to obtain season tickets know the waiting list is too long.</p>
        <p>Some voters resent the idea of multimillion contracts for football players, especially when Vince Lombardi's teams won five N.F.L. titles for what would now be peasant wages.</p>
        <p>Some voters also resent the alleged behavior of Mark Chmura, the tight end who retired from the Packers while awaiting a sexual assault charge involving a 17-year-old girl.</p>
        <p>And if the Green Bay referendum is rejected, it would be a reality check for pro football and all sports. Not everybody is a fan. Not everybody cares about the local franchise. Not even in Green Bay.</p>
