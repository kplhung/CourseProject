        <p>Following are excerpts from remarks prepared for delivery today by Gov. George W. Bush in Allentown, Pa., announcing his plans for revising Medicare:</p>
        <p>When Medicare was passed in 1965, President Lyndon Johnson said: ''No longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years.''</p>
        <p>Thirty-five years later, it is time for our nation to come together and renew that commitment.</p>
        <p>My party has often pointed out the limits and flaws of the Great Society. But there were successes as well, and Medicare is one of them. Before 1965, fully half of American seniors lacked health insurance. They were just an illness or accident away from destitution. Since 1965, more than 80 million American seniors have found a measure of security -- a measure of confidence and dignity -- in Medicare.</p>
        <p>By history and by choice, our nation makes a promise: We will honor our fathers and mothers by providing quality health insurance to every senior citizen. Keeping the promise of Medicare, and expanding it to include prescription drug coverage, will be a priority of my administration.</p>
        <p>Seniors on Medicare know Medicare is showing its age. Its current benefits were modeled on a good private insurance plan -- from 35 years ago, in 1965. Back then, the primary concern was hospital costs. Today, many seniors are treated at home, or in a doctor's office, with drugs and new medical technologies. . . .</p>
        <p>Medicare is an enduring commitment of our country. It must be modernized for our times. . . .</p>
        <p>Vice President Gore talks about the ''people'' versus the ''powerful.'' For eight years, he has been the powerful, and, on health care, he has little to show for it.</p>
        <p>The vice president said he has been involved with every decision for the past eight years. And after eight years of his active involvement, 8 million more Americans are left without health insurance than in 1993 -- a 20 percent increase. Forty-four million Americans now have no health insurance; 2.4 million more children have no health insurance. And nothing has been done to reform Medicare or provide prescription drug coverage. Now the vice president has adopted the president's prescription drug proposal and has challenged America to compare our plans. I welcome the comparison, because there is a lot Vice President Gore isn't telling you.</p>
        <p>The vice president calls for a new access fee for prescription drugs. If you make as little as $12,500 a year, you will pay an additional $24 a month, rising to $50 a month by 2008. This is on top of the premiums, deductibles and co-payments you already pay for Medicare. In return, the government would pay no more than half of the costs of your prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>Here are the practical problems with Al Gore's plan:</p>
        <p>The Gore plan forces seniors into a government-chosen H.M.O. for their drugs -- and if you don't like the plan the Washington bureaucracy puts you into, too bad. You have no other options.</p>
        <p>For the majority of seniors, those who use less than $576 in prescription drugs a year, you will actually lose on the Gore plan: the combination of additional premiums and a high co-pay will force you to pay more than you get back in benefits. Some seniors may want different options -- a higher deductible on drugs, say, in exchange for vision coverage. Under the Gore plan, you're out of luck. You have only one choice: the one that government makes for you. The Gore plan gives seniors just one chance to buy into drug coverage -- at age 64 and a half. If you want coverage at age 67, or you change your mind, you're again out of luck. It's the Gore plan for life, or nothing at all.</p>
        <p>Even if the Gore plan passes, no one will get the full drug benefit for eight years. That's a detail you don't hear much in the vice president's speeches. . . .</p>
        <p>Here is my plan:</p>
        <p>We will keep the guarantee of health care security. Every senior, without exception, will be entitled to the current set of Medicare benefits. We will give all seniors a number of additional options, so they can choose a better policy that meets their individual needs, including benefits like preventive care, vision care and dental care. Some new benefits packages will be traditional fee for service. Others may be networks run by doctors. All must offer the minimum Medicare benefits, and can add additional services to compete for customers. You can choose to keep your current Medicare benefit, exactly the way it is, or you can add to and improve it.</p>
        <p>Every health plan that participates in Medicare must also offer a policy that includes prescription drugs. And every senior will get assistance to make that coverage affordable.</p>
        <p>Seniors with incomes less than $11,300,  couples making less than $15,200 will pay no premium for their medical insurance, and will get prescription drug coverage at no cost. Those just above that income level will get a substantial subsidy to help them afford prescription coverage. Twelve million low- to moderate-income seniors will have a strong insurance plan, including a prescription drug benefit.</p>
        <p>And all seniors, at every income level, will get help with at least 25 percent of their premiums for prescription drug coverage.</p>
        <p>All the policies available through Medicare will be approved by the federal government, to ensure that the proper benefits are offered, and to provide seniors with clear information to compare the plans. And these reforms will be made without increasing the eligibility age for Medicare or increasing the payroll tax. My position is clear. No age increase. No tax increase. That is my commitment to the American people.</p>
