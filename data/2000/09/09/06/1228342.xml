        <p>More than 78,000 New York City public school teachers reported for work yesterday, preparing for the arrival tomorrow of 1.1 million students.</p>
        <p>In a perfect world, those teachers would be assigned classes of no more than 15 students each, a size that would provide maximum opportunities for interaction between teachers and students as they try to meet the state's new, more rigorous educational standards.</p>
        <p>Most students, however, will find themselves in classes nearly double that size: 24 per kindergarten class, 27 for most elementary school classes,  and close to 30 for junior high and high school classes.</p>
        <p>Which raises the questions: Where are all those teachers, and what are they doing?</p>
        <p>The answers are not easy to ascertain. The Board of Education regularly boasts of its 78,000 teachers in publications and on its Web site (www.nycenet.edu), but board officials admit that, in fact, many of those 78,000 are acting  administrators and other educators with a teaching license who never spend time in a classroom.</p>
        <p>According to recent board statistics, the number of classroom teachers is closer to 70,000, or 90 percent of the total. Because principals are responsible for assignments in their schools, and superintendents maintain authority over how teachers are used in their districts, the Board of Education does not control what each of its teachers is actually doing.</p>
        <p>That does not sit well with some critics of the school system, who say that too many teachers are spending too much time doing other things, like performing administrative tasks and training young, unlicensed teachers -- many of whom might not be needed if all of the licensed teachers were in the classroom themselves.</p>
        <p>The issue has been a major point of contention in a continuing lawsuit filed by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a civic group, which charges the state with failing to provide New York City schoolchildren with an adequate education. A decision in the case is expected this fall.</p>
        <p>In its final written arguments in the case, the state claimed that 50,000 of the 78,000 city teachers oversaw general-education classrooms, and 12,000 were assigned to special-education classes. ''This leaves approximately 16,000 teachers,'' or 20 percent of the total, ''who are not teaching the classroom,'' the state said. ''No one from the Board of Education could explain what these thousands of teachers are doing.''</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials, testifying for the plaintiff during the trial last spring, disputed that calculation. But they conceded that licensed teachers performed duties other than student instruction.</p>
        <p>Most of the difference between the average class size and the ratio of students to teachers expected in city classrooms can be traced to the need for teachers to spend part of the school day preparing their lessons. All teachers get one period per day to work on lessons, and high school teachers get a second period to cover administrative tasks, meaning that it takes at least 1.2 to 1.4 teachers to cover a full day with each class.</p>
        <p>In addition, special-education classes are required by law to be far smaller than mainstream classes, and on average are about one-third the size.</p>
        <p>Away from the classroom, teachers perform a variety of tasks. Beverly Donohue, the board's chief financial officer, testified during the trial that they might provide literacy programs to small groups of students, or come into a class for part of the day to teach a specialized subject, like art or music. About 1,000 teachers serve as education evaluators, she said, to determine what programs work most effectively.</p>
        <p>Other teachers might be on sabbatical, Ms. Donohue said, or serving as attendance teachers, finding truants and encouraging them to attend school. Still others serve as acting supervisors while they await formal appointment as a supervisor.</p>
        <p>In addition, Ms. Donohue said, teachers serve on crisis intervention teams, helping to manage students with behavioral problems. And some people remain listed on the Board of Education rolls as teachers to maintain their seniority, while in fact they are serving in other jobs in the school system, like librarian or guidance counselor.</p>
        <p>According to the Board of Education, the two biggest groups of teachers outside the classroom are those who assist other teachers, in evaluation, training and the like (about 3,100), and those who work at district or central headquarters (about 2,600). The remainder teach specific subjects in small groups or are on sabbatical.</p>
        <p>Reports from two Bronx districts, introduced as evidence in the civil trial, show that about 90 percent of their teachers spend regular time in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Community School District 10, for example, reports 2,913 teachers on its rolls, but only 2,565 of those are regular classroom or subject teachers. Of the remaining 348, 167, or nearly 6 percent of the total, are staff developers; 67 are resource room teachers who work part of the day helping students with learning disabilities; 62 are teachers of speech; 21 are deans, who oversee academic departments; 15 deal with students who need special help with the English language; 8 perform other administrative duties; 5 monitor attendance and truancy; 2 deal with student and teacher health issues; and one is a teacher trainer.</p>
        <p>Professional development, or teacher training, is an area that is frequently under fire by critics, who say that teachers spend too much time away from students. Eric Nadelstern, principal of International High School, a specialized high school in Long Island City, Queens, that primarily serves immigrants, said training for teachers was as important as it was for students.</p>
        <p>Still, the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit policy group, said in a report issued last week that New York City teachers spend less time teaching than their counterparts in the rest of the state, and they have shorter workdays than teachers in many other large cities.</p>
        <p>Officials of the United Federation of Teachers, the city teachers' union, say their goal is to get as many fully prepared teachers as possible in the classrooms. But being fully prepared means allowing teachers to use preparatory periods, the officials say.</p>
        <p>Randi Weingarten, president of the union, said that while the union had successfully exempted teachers from a large number of non-classroom duties, including monitoring bathrooms, schoolyards and lunchrooms, some of the time teachers are spending outside the classroom is mandated: for example, the State Education Department requires that uncertified teachers have mentors who work with them for a specific period of time.</p>
        <p>The fact that teachers need to spend time doing something other than teaching was evident yesterday at International High School. At the first faculty meeting of the year, teachers learned that just weeks ago, a student entering his senior year  had committed suicide by hanging himself. Suddenly, teachers found themselves adding sessions in grief counseling to their planned routines for the first week of school.</p>
        <p>''Our students here -- and all New York City high school students -- need a lot of help,'' said Alice Boso, a humanities teacher at International. ''It's not just the education; it's how to negotiate New York City, how to deal with family issues, and how to let them know that somebody cares about them.''</p>
