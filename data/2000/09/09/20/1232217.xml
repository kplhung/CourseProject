        <p>U S West, now part of Qwest Communications International Inc., announced a series of complicated technical initiatives yesterday meant to help new local phone companies connect to its network. Qwest said it would allow its competitors to put more of their equipment in Qwest's facilities and would withdraw 17 lawsuits it had filed against state regulators challenging their ability to force the company to open its systems. The announcements could begin a thaw between Qwest and the competitive local carriers, but Qwest will still remain by far the laggard among the Bells in opening its systems and in its prospects for winning entry to the long-distance market.</p>
