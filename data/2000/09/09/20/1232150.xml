        <p>The other day, Kevin F. Gill, the Board of Education's chief of food and transportation, made a genial host at a $2.18 lunch, the best the New York City school system has to offer.</p>
        <p>Barbara Gulotta, the Martha Stewart of school lunches, presided over the test kitchen in Long Island City, Queens, dressed in a chic black shift, with red lipstick setting off her  sweeping auburn hair.</p>
        <p>For an appetizer, there was a Belgian waffle stick, meant to be held with the fingers and dipped in syrup. Asked for butter, Ms. Gulotta, the director of food technology, chided: ''We don't add butter or salt, only seasonings. We try to keep the fat content below 30 percent of the calories per week.''</p>
        <p>Next, an assistant in a navy blue apron laid out Florentine fish, encased in cream and spinach, then dipped in breading. Angelo Navarra, a bus inspector and lunch guest, carefully scraped off the cream. ''Italians don't trust anyone else's sauces,'' he said apologetically.</p>
        <p>Finally, there was a ''hot pocket,'' dough stuffed with tiny meatballs, cheese and tomato sauce. Mr. Gill left his untouched.</p>
        <p>Tough customers.</p>
        <p>But the point, Mr. Gill said, is that students, who are even tougher customers, do eat the school lunch, at least parts of it, and then come back for more, 860,000 meals a day, 4.3 million a week. And this week, Mr. Gill's confidence, which some would call overweening, in his product got some outside confirmation in a survey of customer satisfaction commissioned by Chancellor Harold O. Levy.</p>
        <p>Rated by more than 1,000 teachers, principals, superintendents and other managers for qualities like courtesy, accuracy, professionalism and quality, Mr. Gill's operation, which includes transportation, came out at or near the top of eight school-related services run from central headquarters. It was beaten on some measures by the Division of Budget Operations and Review (though skeptics might say that nobody dares criticize the budget office, as one bureaucrat remarked).</p>
        <p>Given that Mr. Gill is allocated $2.18 for each lunch -- 45 cents per entree, 8 cents per vegetable, 7 cents per bread, 9 cents per fruit and 17 cents for milk, with the rest going for supplies and labor -- there is, he says, very little margin for improvement. ''It's very easy to take a free kick against school lunch,'' Mr. Gill said Monday. ''It's just about the easiest kick you can make. Except maybe George Bush.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gill's is the face that launches 5,500 buses (more than New York City Transit, with 3,867 buses) and 860,000 hamburgers, fondly known as murderburgers, every day for the city's public schools. As executive director of food services and transportation, he oversees a budget of $878 million, 20,000 employees and dozens of bus contractors, without benefit of an M.B.A. The only agency with a bigger noncommercial food operation is the Defense Department, he says.</p>
        <p>Over the last 18 years, he has taken his share of hits, which he has handled with the impudence perhaps required of an agency trying to persuade 8-year-olds to eat Hollis Wonder, as Monday's lunch of roast chicken was titled in the Queens schools.</p>
        <p>The nadir came in June 1995, when Edward F. Stancik, the independent schools investigator, issued a report accusing Mr. Gill of shipping rancid turkeys to public schools. To Mr. Gill's enduring frustration, the story of the supposedly rotten meat was more prominent on the evening news than the anniversary of the United Nations that week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stancik called for Mr. Gill's dismissal, a recommendation that few have survived. Mr. Gill fought back, and to the amazement of many colleagues, he won.</p>
        <p>In a four-volume response, Mr. Gill countered that Mr. Stancik had built a case through guilt by association. His operation, he said, had been trying to convert whole frozen turkeys into patties, but abandoned the idea when testing showed that the patties turned rancid during processing. The turkeys were donated to hospitals and prisons, where they were served with no ill effect, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gill, who keeps a portrait of Teddy Roosevelt in his office, views the investigation as a case study in how politics infiltrates the school system. At the time, Ramon Cortines, the schools chancellor, was feuding with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.  Mr. Gill said he believed that Mr. Stancik made him a target to discredit Mr. Cortines. Mr. Cortines announced his resignation a week before the Stancik report came out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stancik said yesterday that he does not do political favors.</p>
        <p>A 6-foot-3-inch cross between Bill Bradley and Chevy Chase, Mr. Gill,  54, is one of the school system's Vietnam War generation, known as rebels, intellects and cynics. He was hired as a teacher at the age of 21 with, he jokes, ''just two talents: shooting hoops and teaching.''</p>
        <p>He discovered that he was good at dealing with disruptive youths, and became the supervisor of one of the city's first alternative junior high schools for troubled students. ''I had two kids who murdered other kids in the evening, and came to school the next day,'' he recalled. ''These were not kids throwing spitballs.''</p>
        <p>He moved on to a job in personnel, then caught the attention of Chancellor Frank Macchiarola, becoming his assistant. He took over food services in 1984, adding transportation to his portfolio in 1989.</p>
        <p>He lives in New Jersey with his wife, Kathleen, a nurse. His daughter, Adrienne, is a senior at Princeton University and captain of the women's golf team. His son, Timothy, works on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>In the last year, Mr. Gill has set up one of the most sophisticated Board of Education Web sites, which tells parents what their children will be eating for lunch every day and where and what time to meet buses. Internally, it tracks every student by identification number, name, birth date, address, school and bus route.</p>
        <p>A crew of 20 to 40 customer service representatives, many in wheelchairs, works the telephones from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m., taking calls from parents, some with real complaints but many just anxious because their children are a few minutes late getting home from school. On the first day of school this year, they fielded 6,400 telephone calls, Mr. Gill said; since then, the volume has leveled off to 3,000 to 4,000 a day.</p>
        <p>His standards for washing buses are as strict as the ones for washing food. ''That's not our bus,'' he barked as he climbed into his official Ford Explorer outside a Queens school on Monday. ''It's too dirty.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Navarra, the bus inspector, who was driving, was quick to make the same point. ''We would not have a bus that looks like that.''</p>
