        <p>The White House said yesterday that Russia had suspended a contract to sell Iran sophisticated laser technology that Washington says can be used to make fuel for nuclear weapons. But the Russian scientific institute involved says it still plans to make the sale.</p>
        <p>In an e-mail response yesterday to questions from The New York Times, Boris Yatsenko, director of the Science and Technology Center of Microtechnology, a unit of the government's D. V. Efremov Institute of St. Petersburg, said his institute was planning to sell the equipment, which he said was solely for ''medical, industrial, and scientific purposes.''</p>
        <p>''As we believe, Iran will use lasers and some electrophysical equipment deliverable by us for the scientific, industrial and medical purposes,'' Dr. Yatsenko said in the e-mail. ''Our scientists and technicians will execute maintenance and guarantee support of the deliverable equipment during agreed periods.''</p>
        <p>Because the equipment was purely for nonmilitary purposes, the e-mail added, ''we do not need the government's approval.''</p>
        <p>P. J. Crowley, spokesman for the National Security Council, said: ''We will continue to work with the government of Russia to ensure that no Russian entities provide support to the Iranian nuclear weapons program. We're moving in the right direction, but clearly this remains a work in progress.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials have said they have been trying for three months to persuade Russia to cancel the sale. They said yesterday that Russia had agreed to suspend, but not cancel, the sale at a meeting of experts in New York earlier this month, just before President Clinton and President Vladimir V. Putin met.</p>
        <p>''We were assured at the United Nations summit in New York two weeks ago that the Russian government had ordered a suspension of this sale pending a joint investigation into whether the laser technology could help Iran acquire a nuclear capability,'' a White House official said. ''I think the institute's e-mail indicates some of the problems that the Russian government may be having in trying to rein in some of the more cash-strapped scientific centers.''</p>
        <p>''We think that the Russian government is negotiating in good faith,'' the official said. The official said he was convinced that the ''Russian government has the authority to stop the sale if it chooses to do so.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington, informed that the institute believed that the sale was proceeding, said he could not comment on that issue since ''the dialogue between the White House and the Kremlin is confidential.''</p>
        <p>An administration nuclear expert said he believed that the American team of experts had made a ''very persuasive technical case'' that the equipment the institute is trying to sell Iran could not be used efficiently for other than military purposes. ''I cannot conceive of this type of equipment being used for any other purpose other than the once we are concerned about,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>An expert in nuclear technology said there were many types of lasers, only some of which pose proliferation concerns.</p>
        <p>In his message, the institute director said his center was ''planning to supply to Iran the laser equipment of different types for the medical and scientific purposes by an average power of 15-20 W,'' with the letter standing for watts.</p>
        <p>The expert in nuclear technology said that the Nuclear Suppliers Group -- which identifies the technologies that require international safeguards because they are of proliferation concern -- said the threshold for the type of ''copper vapor'' the institute is planning to sell Iran is 40 watts.</p>
        <p>While the institute's lasers are less powerful than the suppliers group threshold, ''they can still be of concern,'' he added. ''It depends on how Iran is planning to use them, on what other equipment Russia is selling, and what the entire system looks like.''</p>
        <p>American officials have long believed that Iran is trying to acquire nuclear technology for a weapons program. Iran denies that, and asserts that it has forsworn nuclear weapons and is under international safeguards.</p>
