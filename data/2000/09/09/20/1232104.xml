        <p>IN the beginning, images didn't matter. The Internet as first conceived was just a way for government agencies, universities and libraries to share information, and what they shared was fairly mundane: catalog entries, data files, e-mail messages. Animation and movement didn't enter into it.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1990's, the Internet had become the World Wide Web, and word and image were mingling in everything from news to advertising to online video games. But computer users, raised on the high-speed kinetics of television and film, found the experience underwhelming at best, frustrating at worst. ''Animated'' Web sites tended to be slow to load, jumpy and awkward to view.</p>
        <p>Enter Flash, an animation and development tool that three years ago began breathing life into the Web and is now considered the industry standard for Internet design. Flash software, said John Caserta, a designer at Quokka.com, a site dedicated to sports, ''has really increased the palette that artists and Web designers work from.''</p>
        <p>The program, developed by Future-Wave Software in 1995 as an illustration application and now owned by Macromedia Inc., allows designers to embed animated objects directly into their sties. In the past, this would have made Web sites too large and complex for most model connections, but Flash uses special graphics and compression tools that render the finished files remarkably small and easy to download.</p>
        <p>''Flash basically turned me over to the Internet,'' said David Well, a developer at Egomedia.com, a Web design firm based in New York. ''It brings an incredible amount of interactivity to what used to be the static world of Web coding.''</p>
        <p>Some home users, however, may still long for those simpler days. Flash's very flexibility is tempting many designers to create lush, multi-megabyte files that can no longer be considered modem-friendly. The program also requires a plug-in, a special companion program that works with a Web browser; while most browsers now include the plugin, some users will inevitably be left with a blank space where the Internet's latest bells and whistles are supposed to be.</p>
        <p>Below, a look at how Flash works, and where to see it in action.</p>
