        <p>Bobby Valentine was leaning back in his office chair with his feet crossed on the desk in front of him last night at Turner Field. A picture of Valentine would have shown a manager who seemingly looked relaxed, but that was not true. Valentine was still seething inside, the rage just not being shown outwardly anymore.</p>
        <p>A few minutes earlier, Valentine had followed the Mets' embarrassing 12-4 defeat to the Braves by admonishing his players quickly and strongly. Valentine rarely calls team meetings, but after watching the Mets lose for the 20th time in the last 22 games here and lose in a hideous manner, Valentine spoke to them about showing that they are a postseason-bound team.</p>
        <p>It is about time Valentine addressed the Mets in a stern manner. They are letting a season that looked so magical three weeks ago crumble like a stale cookie. They made more mistakes in Atlanta's seven-run second inning than solid teams, teams like the Mets of August, make in a week. It was painful to watch, especially for the manager.</p>
        <p>''Tonight was a brand that I hope we never see again,'' Valentine said. As much as his words were necessary and were designed to remind the Mets that they are a great team, they will seem hollow if the Braves complete the three-game sweep tonight. Valentine can remind the Mets that they are tampering with their aspirations by slip-sliding through September, but he cannot throw a pitch to Chipper Jones or swing at Tom Glavine's fastball. Valentine can vent and hope, so he did.</p>
        <p>''It was a human thing,'' Valentine said. ''I'm being human here. If someone doesn't think I'm allowed to be ticked off, it's their mistake. It's my right and I exerted it.''</p>
        <p>No one was surprised by Valentine's outburst. Characterizing how the Mets played last night is easy. Pick an adjective: Awful. Lousy. Horrendous. The Mets are supposed to be chasing the Braves, but they played in slow motion while the Braves played with urgency. Derek Bell pursued a sure double so deliberately that it became a certain triple. Glendon Rusch threw several fat pitches, one wild pitch and looked like a high school pitcher who forgot to look runners back as the Braves twice stole third base. Robin Ventura had a grounder carom off him.</p>
        <p>''What it takes to regenerate ourselves remains to be seen,'' Todd Zeile said. ''Maybe it takes getting embarrassed by Atlanta in a national forum.''</p>
        <p>Mike Piazza said: ''I've run out of things to say. Obviously, we're playing bad baseball.''</p>
        <p>When Piazza was asked if Valentine's message was needed, Piazza said, ''I don't know if it was needed. We just need to win.''</p>
        <p>That has been almost impossible against the Braves, who have five red, white and blue banners draped along the walls of their clubhouse, showing the years when they won the National League Championship Series in the 1990's. There is also a yellow, red, white and blue banner that is in the most prominent spot because it signifies the World Series title the Braves earned in 1995.</p>
        <p>The Braves see these banners every day. They are constant reminders of how successful the Braves have been in the last decade.</p>
        <p>Glavine sat below the solitary World Series banner yesterday, discussing how the Braves have thoroughly quieted the Mets here and how there is not much difference between the two teams. It is incredible how the Braves have tamed the Mets because, although the Braves have been superior, they have not been so much better that winning 20 of 22 at Turner would seem remotely possible.</p>
        <p>But Glavine knows how the Mets feel, maybe even better than the Mets know these dreary feelings. The competitive side of Glavine wants the Braves to keep beating the Mets to keep those doubts swimming in their minds. The personal side of Glavine knows that the doubts that are following the Mets like stray dogs now will trail the Braves in October. Champions or Chokers? The Braves have been labeled both. In September, the Mets are only gagging.</p>
        <p>''Sure it hinders you,'' Glavine said. ''What they're going through right now is the same thing we go through every postseason. Why haven't you won more? Are you going to win this year or lose again? You start hearing that and it's in the back of your mind. You're trying to play more not to lose then you're playing to win. That's not how you want to play.''</p>
        <p>With those great achievements that are draped across the walls have come great disappointments for the Braves, too. Glavine recalled how virtually every postseason series turned on one play and knows that the Braves might have more than one World Series banner if one play a year evolved differently.</p>
        <p>We are not much different than the Mets, Glavine kept suggesting. The Mets would like to believe that, but they sense something else. When they keep hearing how they cannot stymie the Braves, they desperately try to change that and then they lose again. Glavine is inaccurate in saying the Mets and Braves are similar. The Braves never looked this bad. Even Valentine knows that.</p>
