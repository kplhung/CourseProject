        <p>Aficionados might swear it is impossible to improve on an Oreo cookie or a Hostess cupcake. But two upscale bakers in New York may have done so. Dean &amp; DeLuca is selling dark, dark chocolate sandwich cookies with a white cream filling, which are much richer than Oreos. The filling is softer and sweeter, and the cookie is not so salty, more like chocolate shortbread. They are made by Amy's Cookies (no relation to Amy's Bread), for Dean &amp; DeLuca and Grace's Marketplace. Leslie Nelsson of Cafe St. Bart's in Manhattan and Sage American Kitchen in Queens, is baking excellent chocolate cupcakes with more texture than the packaged prototype and with a filling using cream cheese. They are definitely better than the original.</p>

The cupcakes are $3 each to take out at the bar at Cafe St. Bart's, Park Avenue and 50th Street, and at Sage American Kitchen, 26-21 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City.</p>
