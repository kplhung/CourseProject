        <p>DAVE WOLFF now has a computer (sort of), which puts him ahead of where he was a year ago, when we followed his first steps into the world of e-commerce. With help from me, a high school friend and an avid but amateur Webmaster, Dave put his small-town Main Street coffee shop, The Fine Grind, online. He hoped to sell coffee and coffee-related items on the Web, research sources for supplies, lure customers to the cafe with promotions and increase a sense of community in the rural area around Bel Air, Md., 45 miles northeast of Baltimore.</p>
        <p>To say that this was done on the cheap understates the situation considerably. We built the Web page for nothing using Netscape Composer, a Web-page-construction program, and my personal computer, because Dave did not have one. We spent $70 to register a domain name, www.finegrind.net, and used a free virtual-domain hosting and forwarding company, MyDomain. We got a free e-mail account through Yahoo; a couple of times a day, Dave ran down the street to the Harford County public library to check and send e-mail messages. (Now he checks his e-mail once a day on his own computer, actually a collection of scrounged parts that usually works.)</p>

        <p>To say that this was done on the cheap understates the situation considerably.

We spent $70 to register a domain name, www.finegrind.net, and used a free virtual-domain hosting and forwarding company, MyDomain.

(Now he checks his e-mail once a day on his own computer, actually a collection of scrounged parts that usually works.)</p>
        <p>To say that it was a learning experience also understates the situation considerably. We started with all the Web production bells and whistles that we could cram onto the site -- moving images, a scrolling news ticker and a big printable coupon. What we learned is that each of these features slowed the loading of the page, so we eliminated all but the coolest moving image, a cup of swirling coffee with biscotti. We got rid of the events calendar, too, because updating it was incredibly time-consuming. We also dropped the menu changes and stopped the weekly coffee specials. We kept the links, which include local organizations, weather radar, traffic updates, store location map and e-mail to the shop. We moved the coupons to a separate page. We made a background of close-up pictures of coffee beans, which gave the site a professional look.</p>
        <p>These days, the site is low-maintenance and low-cost, which is a good thing, because the site has been a disappointment in terms of revenue. It turns out that people do not want to buy coffee online from Dave.</p>
        <p>''They want to see and smell the beans grinding and hold the gift mugs,'' Dave explained. ''They also want to get away from their desks.''</p>
        <p>The social payoff from the site has been considerable, with people e-mailing to inquire about the shop, its coffee, its art exhibits and how to go about setting up a similar small-town business. As Dave puts it, ''Not much cash flow, plenty of talk flow.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''You know, I'm glad I didn't spend any money, but I still would love to find a killer coffee item that would sell on the Web.''</p>
