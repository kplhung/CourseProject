        <p>A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit yesterday by PepsiCo that accused Coca-Cola of unfairly wielding its influence to control the beverages served in restaurants, movie theaters and other businesses.</p>
        <p>Filed two years ago in United States  District Court in Manhattan, the lawsuit challenged Coke's widespread use of ''loyalty'' contracts with food-service distributors, the independent vendors who provide restaurants, convenience stores and sports arenas with everything from cups to ketchup to the syrupy concentrate used in fountain drinks. Through these agreements, Pepsi asserted, Coke pressed the distributors to carry its fountain syrup exclusively, effectively barring Pepsi's ability to compete in a $2.3 billion category that is outpacing the rest of the soda market.</p>
        <p>Judge Loretta A. Preska discounted Pepsi's contention, saying the company failed to present enough evidence to warrant a trial. ''By this measure, PepsiCo's brew falls flat,'' she wrote in her decision.</p>
        <p>Pepsi officials said they ''obviously disagree'' with the ruling, but fell short of saying they would appeal it. Many analysts expect PepsiCo will have little choice but to challenge the court's decision, because the company lags so far behind Coca-Cola in an increasingly important segment of the soft- drink business.</p>
        <p>While Coke claims roughly 44 of the overall market, compared with slightly more than 31 percent for Pepsi, much of its lead can be attributed to its ubiquity in restaurants, sports complexes and movie theaters. Anchored by long-standing alliances with fast-food giants like McDonald's and Burger King, Coke commands an astonishing two-thirds of the fountain drink business, roughly three times the size of Pepsi's share, according to Beverage Digest/Maxwell, which tracks the industry.</p>
        <p>On the retail side, the two are locked in a perpetual tug of war, with Coke only a few percentage points ahead of Pepsi. But as consumers shy away from higher soda prices at the supermarket, forsaking the cans and bottles that have long been the industry's core, the pressure to sell more at restaurants and movie theaters has never been greater. Last year, fountain drinks accounted for 23 percent of all soft drinks sold in the United States, up 10 percent from a decade ago. In convenience stores, sales of fountain drinks are growing faster than any other product, except for cigarettes and gasoline, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores.</p>
        <p>Pepsi officials acknowledge that their courtroom challenge represented an integral part of their plan to gain a greater foothold in the fountain business, where many of their expansion efforts have been thwarted in the past. As the former owner of Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell, Pepsi once found it difficult to convince other restaurant chains to serve drinks that were owned and operated by the parent company of their rivals.</p>
        <p>That changed somewhat in 1997, when Roger A. Enrico became Pepsi's chairman, spun off the company's restaurants as Tricon Global Restaurants, and thus increased the number of outlets where Pepsi was sold. At the same time, Pepsi also revamped its contracts with bottlers, allowing the company to sell the concentrate directly to the independent food-service distributors that were at the heart of its legal claims.</p>
        <p>In its suit, Pepsi said Coke had a monopoly in the restaurant business and that the distributors often did not carry its concentrate. But Judge Preska disagreed, saying restaurants and other businesses can -- and often do -- buy their fountain syrup directly from the Pepsi bottlers, without paying more or suffering retribution from suppliers.</p>
