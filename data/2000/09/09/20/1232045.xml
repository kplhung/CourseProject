        <p>FOR the last decade, Jim Long, a second-generation hog farmer near London, Ontario, has sold his pigs through phone and fax orders sent to his company, Baconmaker.</p>
        <p>But about 10 months ago, Mr. Long also returned to selling pigs the way his father had -- at auction. Unlike those earlier auctions, which were live and have largely been abandoned, the ones Mr. Long participates in are online, at Farms.com.</p>
        <p>For some industries that have traditionally used auctions, like livestock, antiques and repossessed cars, the move online seems to be a natural extension of business. But online auctions, many with increasingly sophisticated formats, are also turning up in other industries.</p>
        <p>In the last year, 2,000 electronic marketplaces for everything from plastics to biomedical equipment to shipping have gone online, according to the Gartner Group, an Internet research firm in Stamford, Conn.</p>
        <p>More and more, these marketplaces are using auctions to determine prices for goods -- like used DNA sequencers -- that might not otherwise be put up for sale. Online auctions are proving to be the best way to match the right buyer with the right seller under the right conditions.</p>
        <p>If, for example, Mr. Long wants to find the best price for his pigs but also wants to find a buyer who needs a certain number and whose farm is within a day's drive, an auction lets him do that.</p>
        <p>But for some transactions, auctions may never take hold, and the traditional face-to-face negotiations will most likely continue, namely for items like special recipes for food manufacturers or certain computer parts.</p>
        <p>For many industries, auctions are a good way to sell extra inventory and used goods, especially for products that might instead go unsold. For example, Chemdex.com, which began in 1997 and was one of the earliest marketplaces for life sciences products, recently joined with BioBid.com, a life sciences auction site, and plans to offer auctions.</p>
        <p>David Weber, Chemdex's vice president for marketing, said the auctions would probably be used for excess inventory and used products. For instance, a typical big-ticket item, a DNA sequencer, can cost nearly $100,000, and companies like to try them out before they buy them.</p>
        <p>''We bring equipment in and demonstrate it,'' Mr. Weber said. ''We put bodily fluids through it that could contaminate the machinery, and you can't ethically sell the machinery as new.'' Academic institutions, like university research laboratories, however, buy demonstration goods, and setting up auctions is a good way to tap into that market.</p>
        <p>''In our industry, technology is always changing,'' Mr. Weber added. ''Auctions are a great way to get rid of last year's technology.''</p>
        <p>Auctions are also useful in matching customers with the largest possible number of suppliers, raising or lowering the cost of goods according to the market.</p>
        <p>At GoCargo.com, a shipping marketplace, importers and exporters bid for space on cargo ships.</p>
        <p>''The shipping industry is extremely inefficient,'' said Eyal Goldwerger, the chairman and chief executive of GoCargo.com. ''Offline, you send a fax to your favorite carrier to see how fast they could take your shipment, how much it would cost and what the logistics and price would be. In a couple of days, you get a response, and then you decide.''</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Goldwerger said, ''Every trade route on the planet is full in one direction and less full in the other.''</p>
        <p>With an online marketplace, he said, auctions improve efficiency. Importers and exporters ''go to a Web site, put in a request, and instantly that request is visible to 2,000 -- not 3 or 4 -- service providers in the world.''</p>
        <p>''In several minutes, instead of two, three or four days, you get quotes,'' he said. ''You sit back and you watch people bid for your business.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldwerger said that cargo on the site is split between one-time shipments, which tend to be small, and large, yearly contracts. He would not provide figures on the amount of cargo being moved using the site.</p>
        <p>GoCargo.com, which Mr. Goldwerger said operated tens of thousands of auctions each day, uses technology from Moai, one of the few major auction and online negotiations software companies that has not been acquired by an e-marketplace maker. Mr. Goldwerger said, however, that GoCargo also developed much of its own software -- something that is typical for the industries going online.</p>
        <p>''A large degree of customization is required to meet the specificity of the industry,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As the technology becomes more sophisticated, marketplaces are looking to auction-based negotiations to replace some of the face-to-face, or phone-to-phone, negotiations that take place offline.</p>
        <p>''Auctions are evolving to reflect business processes; they reflect decisions that are complex,'' said Emily Andren, a senior analyst at the Gartner Group.</p>
        <p>For example, at GoCargo, importers might need to find a certain amount of space to move goods from Nebraska to Taiwan in refrigerated containers on a certain date. Online auctions need to take such factors into account.</p>
        <p>Including all the elements that could go into an offline business transaction is a technological challenge.</p>
        <p>I.B.M., which has a preliminary version of its auction software on the market, is using work that the company had done on human gene analysis to develop software that will, eventually, search the Web for products with detailed specifications.</p>
        <p>''Business transactions can require the same amount of complex analysis as human genes,'' said Ed Kilroy, the general manager of electronic commerce at I.B.M.'s software group.</p>
        <p>Even with the most sophisticated software, however, some business transactions will probably never be automated.</p>
        <p>Consider MetalSite.com, a marketplace for the metals industry. It started in 1998 as an auction site for surplus metals and does more than half its business in auctions.</p>
        <p>But Patrick Stewart, the company's chief executive, said that he did not expect to see online auctions entirely replace face-to-face negotiations, which can take months in the metals industry. ''It's not a software issue,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''A car company can spend years co-engineering the hood of a car with a metal producer. Then it's just a matter of sitting down and being rational and talking about how much it costs. How could you auction that? Nobody else has the know-how.''</p>
        <p>The Bidding Can Be About More Than Price</p>
        <p>ONLINE, business-to-business auctions are adopting ''multi-attribute'' or ''multidimensional'' bidding formats, in which buyers do not just bid for goods according to price.</p>
        <p>Instead, bidding is contingent on several factors, including shipping costs, the quality of the goods, delivery time, quantities, payment schedules, insurance rates and past dealings with a supplier. The building blocks for complex online bidding are traditional offline auction formats.</p>
        <p>Some of the most popular formats showing up online are forward auctions, where one seller fields bids from multiple buyers. Here is a summary of some of the most popular:</p>
        <p>ENGLISH AUCTIONS -- In English, or ''ascending bid,'' auctions, potential buyers bid for an item until the highest bid wins. Emily Andren, an analyst with the Gartner Group, said that cattle and other livestock, used equipment and vehicles, real estate and antiques were commonly sold online in English auctions. A variation on the English auction is the Yankee auction, where a number of goods -- say 200 repossessed cars -- are auctioned piecemeal to the highest bidders.</p>
        <p>DUTCH AUCTIONS -- The Dutch, or ''descending bid,'' auction is also common on the Web. In a traditional, offline Dutch auction, so-called because it is modeled on the Dutch flower-market auction, the price of, say, tulips, drops at regular intervals until all the tulips are sold.</p>
        <p>''Dutch auctions are a good way to liquidate things quickly -- things like stock shares or surplus equipment that you really want to get rid of in a hurry,'' Ms. Andren said.</p>
        <p>While this declining price format is used on the Web, eBay calls its ascending-price multi-unit auctions Dutch auctions, too. In eBay-style Dutch auctions, copies of the same item are offered for sale and, in the end, are typically distributed to multiple bidders. Instead of the highest bidder winning the item, the highest bidders win the items but only pay the lowest amount that was bid among them.</p>
        <p>REVERSE AUCTIONS -- Unlike forward auctions, reverse auctions have one buyer and many sellers. Online, reverse auctions can replace ''requests for proposals.'' As Ms. Andren said, ''Somebody looking for something specially designed and who wants competitive bidding for the project might use a reverse auction.''</p>
        <p>SEALED-BID AUCTIONS -- Sealed-bid auctions can be either forward or reverse auctions. In sealed-bid auctions, only the auctioneer can see the bids that have been submitted. Chemical plants sometimes use sealed-bid auctions to preserve bidders' anonymity in a market in which many companies know one another, Ms. Andren said.</p>
