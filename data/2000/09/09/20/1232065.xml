        <p>A new cheese in town has the ecru color and smooth texture of Appenzeller but an herbal twist. The rind is rubbed with herbes de Provence, infusing the cheese, which is fruity tasting, with the aroma of thyme. The cheese, an artisanal import from Switzerland, is called Le Marechal. It is made for a glass of sauvignon blanc. Zabar's, Broadway and 80th Street, is selling Le Marechal for $8.49 a pound. It is $14.95 a pound at Ideal Cheese, which moved this summer from Second Avenue and 63rd Street to 942 First Avenue (52nd Street).</p>
