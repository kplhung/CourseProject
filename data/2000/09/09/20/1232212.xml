        <p>Several agencies are making changes involving public relations operations.</p>
        <p>The Interpublic Group of Companies in New York is reorganizing the public relations divisions of its Allied Communications Group.</p>
        <p>The technology practices of Weber Public Relations Worldwide in Cambridge, Mass., will be merged with Shandwick International in New York to form Weber Shandwick Worldwide in New York, which will specialize in technology, public affairs and entertainment. Weber Shandwick will have 2,500 employees in 68 worldwide offices working for clients like Microsoft and Monster.com; it will probably be the largest worldwide public relations agency, with estimated revenue of $300 million.</p>
        <p>Larry Weber, 45, chairman and chief executive at Allied Communications, was named to the additional post of chief executive at Weber Shandwick. Scott Meyer, 50, chief executive at Shandwick International, becomes chairman at Weber Shandwick and Marijean Lauzier, 41, president and chief executive at the Weber Group unit of Weber Public Relations, becomes president and chief operating officer at Weber Shandwick. Mr. Meyer and Ms. Lauzier report to Mr. Weber.</p>
        <p>The other major public relations division of Allied Communications -- Golin/Harris International in Chicago -- is expanding with the addition of 14 Weber offices in Asia, Europe and the United States. Golin/ Harris continues under its current top management: Al Golin, 71, chairman; Rich Jernstedt, 53, chief executive; and Dave Gilbert, 60, president.</p>
        <p>Also, Havas Advertising in Paris is acquiring a 60 percent stake in Hudson Sandler in London, a financial public relations consulting company. Terms of the cash deal were not disclosed. Hudson Sandler, with 25 employees working for clients like Royal Dalton, will be part of the Diversified Agencies Group unit of Havas. Michael Sandler, 52, continues as chairman.</p>
