        <p>IRIS WEINSHALL has worked in New York City government for almost 20 years. In conversation, she uses phrases like ''maintaining the momentum of the process,'' ''exciting new challenges'' and ''skills sets'' without so much as blinking an eye. She talks about computerizing municipal personnel forms with the kind of joy that most people reserve for talking about their vacations.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Weinshall herself puts it, ''I actually went to graduate school in public administration.''</p>
        <p>Maybe, then, it is only natural that when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani asked her to take a high-profile new job two weeks ago, Ms. Weinshall responded with an immediate act of bureaucracy: She called a meeting.  She gathered her two daughters, Jessica, 16, and Alison, 11. She called in her husband, Chuck. She announced, ''I'm probably going to have to work harder than I've worked before.'' She added: ''I'm going to need everyone's consensus in this.''</p>
        <p>And when the consensus was reached, she moved ahead, as a good manager should, to make sure the transition would go smoothly -- with her husband. ''I said to him, you may have to go to a few more PTA meetings and a few more soccer games to cover for me,'' she recalled. ''And he said, 'That's fine. You've been covering all these years. I'm happy to help out.' ''</p>
        <p>Of course, this is all standard operating procedure for any hard-charging, ladder-climbing, cell-phone wielding, two-income-with-kids New York family. In this case, however, the husband, Charles E. Schumer, happens to be a United States senator for the third most populous state in the nation.</p>
        <p>And the wife's new job is that of commissioner of the Department of Transportation, in a city so bountifully jam-packed that the words ''city'' and ''transportation'' usually don't seem to belong anywhere near each other.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Weinshall, 47, does not seem worried about any of this, it is only because she has spent the better part of three decades studiously preparing for a post just like this, moving through a series of jobs at places with complicated, bureaucratic-sounding names -- the Council of State Governments, the Citizens Union, the state's Urban Development Corporation, the city's Department of Environmental Protection and, finally, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, where she was first deputy commissioner. It was all part of a plan, she said, one that didn't always go as planned, to do what she had known she wanted to do since college, ''to work in government and make government work.''</p>
        <p>''I know it sounds hokey,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Of course, when she has helped her husband campaign, as she did for six weeks during his Senate race in 1998 -- ''All on my own annual leave time,'' she pointed out -- she has run into those people who are a little surprised that she has a role outside that of political spouse. ''People would say, 'What do you do? And I would say, 'I work in city government.' And they would sort of raise their eyebrows.''</p>
        <p>BUT more frequently in her domain, it happens the other way around. ''There were still people in city government, up until the mayor appointed me D.O.T. commissioner,'' she said, ''that I think did not know I was married to Chuck Schumer.'' And if they do, and ask her about it, she does not beat around the bush. ''I say to people, 'I come into work every day -- and work 8 and 10 and 12 and 14 hours -- not Chuck Schumer. It's me making these decisions, not him.' ''</p>
        <p>By the same token, she does not spend any time talking about what it is like to be a Democrat working for a take-no-prisoners Republican mayor, especially one who had intended to run for the other Senate seat from the third most populous state. ''I've always done my job,'' she said. ''I've always worked hard. I haven't played politics in any way.''</p>
        <p>She sat in her office yesterday, where her name had already been painted on the door and the family pictures had been arranged on the windowsill. On her conference table was something that looked like a congratulatory bouquet of flowers, but it was a bouquet of cookies. ''I'm dreading opening it,'' she said. ''I'm trying to lose weight here.''</p>
        <p>And then, almost as if the gods of journalistic symbolism were obliging, the interview that followed was frequently accompanied by choruses of angry car horns, emanating from traffic jams on Broadway below. ''There's a lot of honking all over the city,'' she conceded, and added that her first priority as she took over the department would be trying to ease the growing traffic congestion that seemed to be choking the city.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Weinshall admits she does not have much experience with traffic, she did have some early experience with it that she feels counts more than technical knowledge. Her father, and two of her uncles, were cabdrivers. And so most of what she knows about the city, and even some of what she knows about government, she says, she first learned from a cabdriver's perspective.</p>
        <p>''When you're a cabdriver, you get people in your cab all the time who are talking about what's going on with the city,'' she said, ''what's working, what's not working.''</p>
        <p>''And that's where I really learned what government means to people,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, Ms. Weinshall accompanied her mother in a visit to her father's grave. ''And my mother looked at me and said, 'So did you tell your father the news?' And I looked at her and said, 'He knows.' ''</p>
