        <p>Minutes before the fourth-period bell rang, Kathy Aborn, a computer sciences teacher at East Boston High, laid into school district officials about their contract offer, saying the city's teachers were dead serious in threatening to go on strike next month.</p>
        <p>''I think their offer is pitiful,'' she said. ''They're trying to take away the few extra privileges we have.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Aborn complained that the school district wanted to eliminate many of the privileges that the most senior teachers had in choosing where they taught and had proposed a wage increase of less than 10 percent over three years. She says teacher salaries have lagged far behind those of other professionals.</p>
        <p>Tensions are running so high that Boston's 6,500 public schoolteachers narrowly defeated a motion to go on strike on the first day of school. Instead, they set Oct. 11 as a strike deadline and adopted a ''work to rule'' strategy that calls for doing nothing beyond what the contract specifically requires.</p>
        <p>''I would say teachers are the angriest I've ever seen them,'' said Edward Doherty, president of the Boston Teachers Union.</p>
        <p>But the anger, part of which may well be a negotiating tactic, is not limited to Boston. It is a tense autumn in school districts across the nation, including in three of the nation's largest cities, New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where teachers' contracts have expired or are about to expire.</p>
        <p>Teachers, feeling left behind by the economic boom and emboldened by the teacher shortage, are pushing for large raises. School boards, swept up in the nationwide push for educational reform, are pushing back, demanding far-reaching changes to improve performance, including merit pay, longer school days and an end to seniority.</p>
        <p>In Buffalo, 4,000 teachers went on strike for two days, while 21,000 Philadelphia teachers are threatening a walkout later this week. In Los Angeles, teachers have also warned of strikes if negotiations break off, while in New York City, the 80,000-member teachers' union is already holding demonstrations, even though its contract does not expire until November.</p>
        <p>There have been teacher strikes in half a dozen smaller communities, including Hamilton, N.J., Punxsutawney, Pa., and Richmond Heights, Ohio. While there are fewer strikes this fall than was the case a decade ago, this is largely because state officials have made clear to teacher leaders that they will be jailed or fined if they spearhead strikes.</p>
        <p>Teachers say that the nature of the negotiations is more complex than in many previous rounds. In New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Los Angeles, officials are seeking large-scale change in the face of louder and louder calls for charter schools and vouchers. As a result, while negotiations in the 1990's often focused on details like whether a raise should average 2 percent a year or 2.5 percent, this time around school officials have more ambitious goals.</p>
        <p>In New York, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has proposed that teachers be paid based on the test results of the students in their classrooms. In Philadelphia, the school board is also demanding performance-based merit pay, adding 75 minutes to each school day, adding five days to each school year, and getting rid of some of the seniority preferences that base school staffing not on what a principal thinks is best, but on how much seniority a teacher has.</p>
        <p>''Some of the reforms that bear on teachers are beginning to gain some traction on the ground, and teachers' organizations don't like that at all,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., an education expert at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization.</p>
        <p>Many teachers say that after they accepted salary freezes or low pay increases during times of recession and budget deficits, in today's prosperous times, negotiations should focus on giving teachers large raises and increasing starting salaries, usually just above $30,000, to attract the two million new teachers the nation will need over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Sandra Feldman, president of the million-member American Federation of Teachers, said, ''I think you're seeing teachers feeling that they're being totally left out in a period when the economy is booming and when there are surpluses at every level of government, when demands on them are greater than ever and when they go to the bargaining table, all anybody wants to talk about is merit pay.''</p>
        <p>''It's like everything we won over the years they just want to take it away,'' said Marie Ann Adduci, a first-grade teacher at William E. Russell Grammar School in Boston's blue-collar Dorchester neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The teachers at that school, cited last year as one of Boston's best, say they are angry that after putting in so many extra hours to improve the school, the school district wants to place restrictions on their daily preparation time and add up to 30 extra hours onto their school year.</p>
        <p>''On the Richter scale, I'd say the tensions are about an 8,'' said Jim Fay, an elementary school math teacher for the past 31 years. ''A lot of teachers feel funny that their children in their entry-level jobs are earning twice what they do.''</p>
        <p>Thomas W. Payzant, superintendent of Boston's schools, said his negotiating goals were not to squeeze teachers but to improve education. And he and several other school officials acknowledged that if they wanted to persuade state legislatures to increase financing for their financially strapped districts, they needed to push for some of the changes that legislators wanted.</p>
        <p>''There is great pressure on public schools here and across the country to improve, and that means we've got to focus on the things we do well and change those things we don't do well,'' Mr. Payzant said. ''We have to find a way to be flexible and nimble in schools to compete with charter schools and those who are advocating vouchers.''</p>
        <p>For example, he said loosening seniority rules would make it easier for principals to assemble a faculty that they believed to be most appropriate for their schools.</p>
        <p>Pedro Ramos, president of the Philadelphia School Board, said:  ''This isn't just about modifying 35 years of work rules. This is about the future of public education in Philadelphia. We know that if all we do is keep the status quo, the school district will not survive financially or academically.''</p>
