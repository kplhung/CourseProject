        <p>Editorial urges Congress to approve $2.8 billion sought by Pres Clinton for ambitious new strategy to protect nation's forests and grasslands from runaway fires</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>What President Clinton has called ''one of the worst fire seasons in memory'' has yielded at least one tangible benefit -- an ambitious new firefighting strategy aimed at protecting the nation's forests and grasslands from runaway fires like those that have scorched more than 6.7 million acres in the last two months. It has also produced a rare moment of bipartisan harmony in an otherwise rancorous election year. Meeting in Salt Lake City, six Western governors, five of them Republicans, joined with administration officials in urging Congress to approve Mr. Clinton's $2.8 billion request to get the plan under way. Congress should heed their plea, while resisting the temptation to reopen an unproductive debate over the administration's earlier proposals to protect millions of acres of federal forests from commercial logging.</p>
        <p>The plan would provide $1.6 billion in new money beyond the existing $1.2 billion firefighting budget. Of the new money, $900 million would replenish funds depleted by the high cost of fighting this summer's fires, leaving $700 million for prevention. The prevention strategy has two main components. It would expand the current policy of controlled burns, fires deliberately set to reduce combustible underbrush and shrubs. More important, it will greatly increase the mechanical thinning of overgrown forests by removing the smallest, most fire-prone trees while leaving the largest, most fire-resistant ones behind. Current thinning efforts cover just 2.4 million acres a year, a fraction of the 40 million acres judged to be at serious risk.</p>

        <p>What President Clinton has called ''one of the worst fire seasons in memory'' has yielded at least one tangible benefit -- an ambitious new firefighting strategy aimed at protecting the nation's forests and grasslands from runaway fires like those that have scorched more than 6.7 million acres in the last two months. It has also produced a rare moment of bipartisan harmony in an otherwise rancorous election year. Meeting in Salt Lake City, six Western governors, five of them Republicans, joined with administration officials in urging Congress to approve Mr. Clinton's $2.8 billion request to get the plan under way. Congress should heed their plea, while resisting the temptation to reopen an unproductive debate over the administration's earlier proposals to protect millions of acres of federal forests from commercial logging.</p>
        <p>The plan would provide $1.6 billion in new money beyond the existing $1.2 billion firefighting budget. Of the new money, $900 million would replenish funds depleted by the high cost of fighting this summer's fires, leaving $700 million for prevention. The prevention strategy has two main components. It would expand the current policy of controlled burns, fires deliberately set to reduce combustible underbrush and shrubs. More important, it will greatly increase the mechanical thinning of overgrown forests by removing the smallest, most fire-prone trees while leaving the largest, most fire-resistant ones behind. Current thinning efforts cover just 2.4 million acres a year, a fraction of the 40 million acres judged to be at serious risk.</p>
        <p>One novel feature is the plan's organizing principle. It calls for sharing responsibility among various levels of government, which appealed to the Western governors. The Forest Service and the Interior Department would provide overall supervision, making sure that the thinning strategy is not used to expand commercial logging beyond federally mandated levels or undercut broad conservation goals. The states will play a central role in deciding which areas, including state and private lands, most need thinning.</p>
        <p>Once these priorities have been set, local governments will be asked to do the actual work, possibly through community agencies. In the words of Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, these agencies could provide ''jobs in the woods for local residents,'' much as the Civilian Conservation Corps created jobs during the 1930's. In any case, the big timber companies would not be invited to participate. The administration fears that they would insist on cutting enough big trees to meet their profit targets, and cutting big trees is exactly the wrong strategy. Indeed, as a Congressionally mandated report released three weeks ago makes clear, heavy logging in years past has left the forests vulnerable to big fires by leaving behind dense stands of flammable small trees and underbrush.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, there are signs that a few Western senators will use the administration's budget request to open a broader debate on forest policy and to make the case, however shaky it may be, that the best way to make forests healthier is to allow more timber sales on public lands. One senator, Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho, has called for hearings on the subject. This is not where Congress should be putting its time and energy. As of yesterday, 33 fires were still burning throughout the West. What the country needs is not an acrimonious debate over timber sales but a solid strategy for preventing fires.</p>
