        <p>At 6 feet 7 inches, with a thin waist and cantilevered chest, Tom Malchow takes a 42 extra long in the new high-tech swimming bodysuits. He trains ferociously, even pulling a 10-gallon bucket through the water to increase drag, just as track sprinters trail parachutes during workouts.</p>
        <p>He holds the world record in the 200-meter butterfly, and no one appeared capable of beating him in the Olympic final on a night of sustained brilliance and swift redemption. But Malchow felt oddly nervous after his warm-up, his stomach churning like the water that he roils with his rapacious windmilling stroke.</p>
        <p>Don't go out too fast, his coach, Jon Urbancek, told Malchow. ''No one can catch you coming home,'' he reminded him.</p>
        <p>Swimming a wonderfully controlled race, Malchow restrained the urge to chase the leaders early and took over the 200 butterfly in the final 50 meters, winning a gold medal in 1 minute 55.35 seconds, an Olympic record and the third-fastest time ever. It was the sixth victory for the United States in swimming at the Sydney Games.</p>
        <p>''For four years, I've wanted that moment,'' an ecstatic Malchow said. ''The world record was great, but this is unreal.''</p>
        <p>The most stunning swim tonight occurred in the 100-meter freestyle semifinals, when Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands shattered the world record in 47.84. In a race in which records are usually lowered by hundredths of a seconds, he shaved more than three-tenths of a second from the previous standard of 48.18. It was the 10th swimming world record set at these Olympics.</p>
        <p>The Dutch star seemed as astonished as he had been on Monday after defeating Ian Thorpe, Australia's boy wonder, in the 200-meter freestyle, matching his own world record of 1:45.35. He had hardly slept after the victory, he said, and he felt tired having to swim again today in the 100 freestyle. The final is Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''I didn't expect this at all,'' van den Hoogenband said. ''I wasn't going full speed. I can go at least a tenth of a second faster.''</p>
        <p>Because swimming has been tarnished through the years by drug cheats, van den Hoogenband's time is certain to raise some suspicions. But Gary Hall Jr., the 1996 Olympic silver medalist in the 100 freestyle, said he had no doubts that the Dutch swimmer was clean. Van den Hoogenband has a history of impressive speed, having finished fourth in the 100 freestyle at the Atlanta Games and having won six gold medals at the 1999 European championships.</p>
        <p>''He is clean, in my opinion,'' Hall said after qualifying for Wednesday's final in sixth place. ''He's proven it in the past. It's not like he came out of nowhere.''</p>
        <p>After being upset in the 200 freestyle, Thorpe recovered assertively tonight, swimming the leadoff leg for Australia's 4x200-meter relay team, which broke its own world record in 7:07.05. Thorpe gave the Australians a three-second lead after completing his leg and won his third gold medal of the Olympics. The Americans finished a distant second in 7:12.64. The Netherlands took the bronze in 7:12.70, with van den Hoogenband swimming the anchor leg.</p>
        <p>Thorpe is expected to seek a fourth gold in the 4x100-meter individual medley relay.</p>
        <p>Australia took its second gold medal tonight and fourth of the competition when Susie O'Neill, the defending Olympic champion in the 200-meter butterfly, won the 200 freestyle in 1:58.24. Martina Moravcova of Slovakia won the silver (1:58.32) and Claudia Poll of Costa Rica the bronze (1:58.81).</p>
        <p>Yana Klochkova, an 18-year-old from Ukraine, became a double winner by taking the 200-meter individual medley in 2:10.68. She set a world record in the 400 individual medley last Saturday. Beatrice Caslaru of Romania was second tonight in 2:12.57.</p>
        <p>The bronze in the 200 individual medley went to Cristina Teuscher of New Rochelle, N.Y., in 2:13.32. After her senior year of high school, Teuscher won a gold medal on the American 4x200-meter freestyle relay team at the Atlanta Games. She grew unnerved by pressure during her individual performances, however, finishing sixth in the 200 freestyle and eighth in the 400 freestyle.</p>
        <p>''This shows I've definitely matured a lot,'' Teuscher said.</p>
        <p>She could have attended any of the major collegiate swimming powers, such as Stanford or Southern Cal, but she remained close to her parents and attended Columbia University. She recently graduated with a degree in psychology. She said that tonight's performance confirmed that her decision had been the correct one.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't ever a question in my mind,'' Teuscher said. ''You can't complain when you get a medal in the Olympics.''</p>
        <p>At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Malchow was the youngest American swimmer at 19. A native of St. Paul, he won a silver medal in the 200 butterfly and was known as Puppy Chow. Now he is the big dog, having posted 8 of the 12 fastest times in the event, including the world record of 1:55.18 in June.</p>
        <p>Malchow attended the University of Michigan but did not win any collegiate titles even though he was an Olympic silver medalist by age 19. Tall and thin, he was ''all arms and legs,'' Urbancek, his college and club coach, said. Weight training and workouts with a medicine ball helped strengthen Malchow's torso, and he now swims with a smoothly undulating stroke. ''He hugs the water like a fish,'' Urbancek said.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Malchow wore a sleeveless version of a bodysuit that covered him from neck to ankles. In June, he became the first American to set a world record in the new suit by Speedo, known as the Fastskin, which mimics sharkskin in that it contains tiny V-shaped ridges to help water pass more efficiently over a swimmer's body. By compressing the muscles, the suit is also said to reduce the buildup of lactic acid, which causes fatigue. Malchow said he rides higher in the water, encountering less resistance and holding his form as exhaustion sets in, like an infection, in the final churning meters of the butterfly.</p>
        <p>The suit also provides a psychological edge, he said, adding that he feels a bit like Clark Kent changing into Superman.</p>
        <p>''The mental edge is important,'' he said. ''I feel like my body is sliding through the water. I feel like I imagine a shark does.''</p>
        <p>Just as the new suit has helped him, so has a rule change that does not allow a swimmer to remain underwater for more than 15 meters at the start and off the turns. Denis Pankratov of Russia remained underwater for 30 to 35 meters with his dolphin kick in winning the 100 and 200 butterfly at the Atlanta Games. Tonight, Pankratov set a searing early pace but faded to seventh.</p>
        <p>''The rule change helped Tom a lot,'' Urbancek said. ''He was not very good underwater.''</p>
        <p>As do many swimmers, Malchow first climbed into the water because of childhood bouts of asthma, which were eased by breathing the warm, humid air of an indoor pool. But he was growing so fast as a 10-year-old and his knee became sore, so his right leg was placed in a cast for about a month to help strengthen the hinge joint.</p>
        <p>In 1984, Malchow watched the Los Angeles Games on television and read that Michael Gross, the German swimmer known as the Albatross for his avian wingspan, had been awarded a Porsche for his gold-medal winning performances in the 200 freestyle and the 100 butterfly.</p>
        <p>Malchow's father told him he would give him a Corvette if he won an Olympic gold medal of his own. Not only did Malchow grow up to be the same height as Gross, he became an Olympic champion in the butterfly.</p>
        <p>''I guess I've got to pay up,'' Tim Malchow said of his son. ''I dodged a bullet in '96. But it's a pretty good trade.''</p>
        <p>After 50 meters tonight, Malchow sat in fifth place, which may have seemed disappointing, but a restrained start had been planned. He had gone out too quickly at the Olympic trials in July and had struggled home. In the Olympics, Malchow bided his time, moving to third place, then second with 50 meters remaining, before drawing away down the homestretch, finishing nearly a half-second ahead of Denys Sylant'yev of Ukraine (1:55.76). Justin Norris of Australia took the bronze in 1:56.17.</p>
        <p>''My strength is the back half,'' Malchow said. ''If I was within half a body length, no one was going to catch me coming home.''</p>
