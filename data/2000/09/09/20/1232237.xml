        <p>Lenny Krayzelburg is swimming toward another Olympic gold medal. Jenny Thompson would settle for one individual one of her own.</p>
        <p>Krazyelburg, who already has one gold at the Sydney Games, cruised to an Olympic record in preliminaries of the 200-meter backstroke this morning at 1 minute 58.40 seconds.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't thinking about the record,'' Krayzelburg said. ''I just wanted to swim a good race.''</p>
        <p>Thompson, American's most-decorated female gold medalist, qualified third in the 100 freestyle preliminaries -- her last chance to win an individual gold. It won't be easy with Inge de Bruijn in the field. The world record-holder was top qualifier in the morning at 54.77. Dara Torres of Beverly Hills, Calif., was second, 55.12, followed by Thompson's 55.22.</p>
        <p>In the 100 fly, Thompson was expected to be De Bruijn's top challenger but faded to fifth as the Dutch superstar blew away the field. The 27-year-old American did win the sixth gold medal of her career, anchoring the 400 freestyle relay to pass Bonnie Blair for most golds by an American woman. But all of Thompson's gold medals have come in relays. Her only individual medal was silver in the 100 freestyle at the 1992 Barcelona Games.</p>
        <p>Krayzelburg, world record-holder in the 200, broke the Olympic mark of 1:58.47 set by Spain's Martin Lopez-Zubero eight years ago. Krayzelburg won gold Monday in the 100 backstroke and is an overwhelming favorite in the 200.</p>
        <p>Krayzelburg, a native of Ukraine who became an American citizen in 1995 and lives in Studio City, Calif., should face his toughest challenge from 17-year-old Aaron Peirsol of Irvine, Calif. He was second-fastest in qualifying at 1:59.10, advancing to the 16-man evening semifinals.</p>
        <p>Tom Dolan of Arlington, Va., followed up a world-record performance in the 400 individual medley by qualifying second in the 200 individual medley at 2:01.55. Italy's Massimiliano Rosolino was first in 2:00.92.</p>
        <p>Agnes Kovacs of Hungary set an Olympic record in the women's 200 breaststroke prelims at 2:24.92, wiping out the mark of 2:25.41 set by South African Penny Heyns four years ago. Kristy Kowal of Reading, Pa., was second fastest (2:26.73) and Amanda Beard of Irvine, Calif., placed eighth in 2:27.83.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, Heyns struggled home in 20th at 2:30.17 -- about 6 1/2 seconds off her 1999 world record -- and didn't make the semis. (AP)</p>
        <p>BASEBALL  Cubans Finally Lose</p>
        <p>After 21 Olympic games, the mighty Cubans finally struck out.</p>
        <p>Cuba took its first Olympic baseball loss today, shut down by a team from the Netherlands that had never experienced such a moment. The ex-New York Yankee Hensley Meulens's bases-loaded double drove in three runs in a four-run third and the Netherlands held on for a 4-2 victory.</p>
        <p>It was a watershed in Olympic baseball history. Cuba (3-1) had breezed through the first two official tournaments unbeaten, winning the gold in Barcelona and Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Ken Brauckmiller held the Olympics' top lineup to seven hits in eight innings, leaving to a standing ovation after Miguel Caldes reached on a throwing error to open the ninth.</p>
        <p>Patrick Beljaards relieved, gave up a walk and got a forceout at second, bringing up the top of the order. Luis Ulacia hit into another forceout as a run scored, bringing up Yobal Duenas.</p>
        <p>The center fielder took a ball, fouled one off, then hit into another forceout at second, with Ralph Milliard cradling the ball in his glove for a moment before the Netherlands (2-2) held surprisingly low-key congratulations. Milliard, a former Met, also had a run-scoring single. (AP)</p>
        <p>TENNIS  Davenport Advances</p>
        <p>Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport returned to Australia and the Olympic stage today by beating Paola Suarez of Argentina, 6-2, 6-2. Davenport is the reigning Australian Open and defending Olympic champion.</p>
        <p>But of the seeded men, two lost. Seventh-seeded Tim Henman was ousted, 6-3 6-2, by Karol Kucera of Slovakia, and No. 12 Marcelo Rios of Chile was defeated by Argentina's Mariano Zabaleta, 6-7 (8), 6-4, 7-5. And Michael Chang of the United States fell to the Canada wild card Sebastien Lareau, 7-6 (6), 6-3. The only American man to win his initial match was Jeff Tarango, 31, who defeated Diego Camacho of Bolivia 6-0, 6-1. (AP)</p>
        <p>DRUG NEWS  First Positive Tests</p>
        <p>The Bulgarian weight lifter Ivan Ivanov was stripped of his silver medal today for using a banned substance. The vice president of weight lifting's governing body called Ivanov an idiot and said he had disgraced the sport.</p>
        <p>The International Olympic Committee stripped the medal from Ivanov, a 1992 Olympic champion, who had tested positive for furosemide, a diuretic, after Saturday's 123-pound competition. Diuretics are used to flush fluid from an athlete's body to reduce weight, but also can mask the presence of other performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
        <p>Sam Coffa, the vice president of the International Weight Lifting Federation, said: ''He's an old lifter, he probably was having trouble making weight and he said, 'I'll take a chance.' Why, I don't know. He must have been smelling too many smelling salts or got too much chalk in his brain,'' he said. ''To do something like this was stupid.''</p>
        <p>Also banned was the hammer thrower Vadim Devyatovsky from Belarus. He tested positive for nandrolone in an out-of-competition test in the Olympic village. (AP)</p>
        <p>SHOOTING  A Shoot-Off for Gold</p>
        <p>Richard Faulds of Britain won the men's double trap in a shoot-off with the defending gold medalist Russell Mark of Australia. Mark, the 1996 Atlanta double trap champion, led most of the way today but faltered in the final regulation round and the playoff. (AP)</p>
