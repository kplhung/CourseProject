        <p>From the start, the two Mexican immigrants who were attacked Sunday with a shovel, a crowbar and a knife had a bad feeling about the white men who had lured them to an abandoned building with the promise of work.</p>
        <p>It looked more like a ghost town than a construction site, they said today as they sat in Brookhaven Memorial Hospital, one wearing a neck brace, the other with bandages around his punctured neck and slashed left wrist.</p>
        <p>''I told my friend, 'I don't like this one minute,' '' said Magdaleno Escamilla, 28, a native of Hidalgo state in Mexico, who had come to the United States a few months ago to find work. ''I told him to pay attention. It didn't look like there was much work here.''</p>
        <p>The next thing Mr. Escamilla remembers was being beaten unconscious with what he believes was a crowbar. He awoke when he heard the screams of his friend and housemate, Israel Perez, 19. ''He was screaming, 'Help me, help me!' And the man who attacked me started running away,'' Mr. Escamilla said. ''My friend was wrestling with the knife. So I took up the crowbar and the other man ran. I honestly don't know how we got away.''</p>
        <p>The incident, which the police are investigating as a bias crime, has become the talk of this Long Island hamlet of 15,000, which  was already electric with racial tensions. Tonight, despite a soaking rain, immigrant workers and supporters held a march here to draw attention to their cause, trading shouts and taunts with protesters opposed to immigrants. In all, about 150 to 200 people attended, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the events leading to the beating began at dawn on Sunday, when two white men first tried to hire another Mexican man who was standing in a field next to a 7-Eleven, one of the most popular spots on Long Island for day laborers and contractors to barter for labor.</p>
        <p>According to the victims' account, this Mexican man was a friend. He had already arranged work for himself that day, so he led the two white men to the house that the three Mexicans share with a dozen others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Escamilla said he was lured into a silver station wagon by the promise of work. The men never discussed money, he said. The workers were taken to an abandoned warehouse off Exit 68 of the Long Island Expressway in Shirley, and were told to start digging.</p>
        <p>Fifteen minutes later, the two wounded workers managed to stumble to the expressway. ''We saw cars, but seeing our condition, the people did not want to stop,'' Mr. Escamilla said. Finally, a man who thought the pair had been in a car accident stopped and called the police on his cell phone.</p>
        <p>''It is being treated as a bias attack,'' said Detective Sgt. Robert Reecks of the Suffolk County Police. He also said it appeared as though the ambush was carefully planned.</p>
        <p>''It appears as though the assailants were trying to kill them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The attackers were each described as unshaven, about 5-foot-9 and in their late 20's. One man is thin, the other heavyset, Sergeant Reecks said. He added that the authorities were following up on dozens of leads. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was advising investigators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Escamilla was treated and released. Mr. Perez underwent surgery for a severed tendon in his left wrist Monday and was listed in stable condition at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital. He was expected to be released this evening.</p>
        <p>''I came with a great American dream that all Latinos have,'' Mr. Perez said, lying back in a wheelchair and appearing disoriented. ''It is a great country, but I want to forget this happened. I guess I will go home and I won't be back.''</p>
        <p>The attacks added fuel to already smoldering tensions in Farmingville, said the immigrants, their advocates and local politicians.</p>
        <p>Each summer, more than 1,000 Hispanic workers flock here looking for work as landscapers and handymen. They are picketed by a group of Americans every Saturday morning.</p>
        <p>These residents say the day laborers are responsible for all kinds of problems, from a decrease in property values to a spiraling crime wave that the police say does not exist.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the Suffolk County Legislature narrowly voted down a proposal to file a federal suit to force the Immigration and Naturalization Service to move against illegal immigrants. And this year, the Town of Brookhaven, which includes Farmingville, passed a law aimed at illegal immigrants, limiting the number of people who may occupy a rental house.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the day laborers said, they are often not paid by contractors and must endure insults and racial slurs directed at them by morning commuters.</p>
        <p>Joseph Caracappa, a Republican county legislator from Selden, who sponsored the bill to sue the I.N.S., did not return calls left at his office today. The group that urged Mr. Caracappa to sponsor the legislation, said they did not believe their rhetoric had inflamed racial hatred in the community.</p>
        <p>''This was inevitably going to happen whether we existed or not,'' said Ray Wysolmierski, a leader of the group, called the Sachem Quality of Life. ''People wait on the corner for people to hire them. Those who hire them aren't going to win a Nobel Peace Prize. As far as I'm concerned, they're all criminals.''</p>
        <p>Paul Tonna, the Republican majority leader of the Suffolk County Legislature, said the bill only deepened divisions. ''It demonstrated how much easier it is to destroy a community rather than build one,'' said Mr. Tonna, who voted against the measure. ''After I voted against it, people picketed my home carrying signs that called me a papist.''</p>
        <p>At tonight's march, the workers and their supporters asked that the authorities allow them to build a clean, safe hiring hall where they would be better shielded from attacks.</p>
        <p>''It's been such a bad summer already with the rain,'' said Moises Recendiz, 19. ''I'm trying to live a dream that is turning into a nightmare. But no matter what, I'm not leaving.''</p>
