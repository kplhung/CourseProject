        <p>WHEN I read Stephen King, I expect to be frightened, possibly sleep with the lights on, even believe I will be attacked by my blender. But I don't expect to pull a hamstring.</p>
        <p>I am lying on my desk, staring up at the computer screen. In this position, I am reading Mr. King's new online-only book, ''The Plant,'' an engrossing tale about satanic mass ritual slaughter. But I am deeply concerned that I will pull a leg muscle on my dismount.</p>
        <p>In Stephen King's world, people and machines mutate into all manner of maniac and monster. But in the real world, my computer actually has mutated. It has become a book, and more -- a radio, a television, a video game console, a compact disc and DVD player. It is capable of conveying a vast range of entertainment, making it the uber-appliance.</p>
        <p>But the question is, can the PC truly substitute for its Old World forebears? Can it satisfy the soul?</p>
        <p>It may seem the primitive appliances win this debate hands down. But for all their welcome ways and conveniences, our traditional devices have their drawbacks, collectively consuming batteries, paper and space, offering programming options limited by airwaves and cable stations, and, frequently, leading to fisticuffs over who holds the remote.</p>
        <p>To give it a sporting chance, I have decided that for three days the PC, along with a high-speed Net connection, will be my sole source of entertainment. At the end of that period I will make a choice. I will vote either the computer or my old appliances off the island. I only hope I am not attacked by my blender.</p>
        <p>Day 1</p>
        <p>My quest to kick back with a good book leads me to Stephen King's site. One of the best-selling authors of all time has written ''The Plant'' to test the Internet market. It works like this: he has written the first 5,000 words of the book, and he asks that readers pay $1 to download it. Mr. King says this is on the honor system but hastens to add that if people don't pay, he'll quit writing the story. On the upside, he says, if readers pay, we together can become ''Big Publishing's worst nightmare.''</p>
        <p>I am torn. On the one hand, I never really aspired to stick it to the publishing industry. Then again, I believe you should always respect the copyright of someone who writes about satanic mass ritual slaughter.</p>
        <p>The righteous person seeking to read ''The Plant'' must then take two steps. The first is to pay the $1. One way to do so is to visit Amazon.com, register, then submit a credit card.</p>
        <p>It seems like a pain, but I'm feeling pretty good because I can use my United Airlines affinity Visa card, which gives me one frequent-flier mile for every dollar I spend. If Mr. King, whose prefaces are longer than ''War and Peace,'' writes 20,000 more segments, as I believe he can, I'll earn a free trip on United, and the right to have flight plans delayed or canceled on the way to any city in the domestic United States.</p>
        <p>The second step is to download a program called Adobe Acrobat from the Internet. Such programs, which are used to display text or play music, animation or video, are called plug-ins. A user downloads the plug-in to the hard drive, finds the directory where it was downloaded, then installs the plug-in. This takes anywhere from 10 minutes to three weeks. If Mr. King wanted to write about something really scary, he should write about plug-ins.</p>
        <p>In this case, though, the process is fairly seamless. It takes about an hour to find the book, pay for it, download the plug-in and download the book. But soon I am reading.</p>
        <p>The only problem is that I am not particularly comfortable, sitting in my computer chair. I like to recline when I read. First, I try to lie on the desk. Then I decide to drag my computer to the couch, perch the monitor on my chest and read that way.</p>
        <p>''I would advise against doing that,'' said the reference librarian at the San Francisco Public Library. I had called to ask for advice on how to  read an e-book comfortably. I explained that the monitor was probably no heavier than one of Mr. King's hardcovers, but the librarian had a larger concern. ''You should get out of the house,'' she said. ''It's good to hang out with other people.''</p>
        <p>Still, at the end of the day, I believe I have made progress. I have paid for, downloaded and digested entertainment online. This experience will serve me well in the coming days, as I set due course for more elaborate media, like audio and animation.</p>
        <p>Day 2</p>
        <p>At my fingertips are 3,500 radio stations, which send their programming live on the Internet. There are stations from every state, and many nation states. There is sports talk, car talk, home improvement talk. There are stations in Spanish, German, French, Russian, Korean, you name it. One station, ABS radio, calls itself ''Australia's premier Arabic radio station.'' Amazing. With the reach of the Internet, you don't even have to travel to Australia to get your fill of Arabic.</p>
        <p>In the spirit of internationalism, I log on to the Web site of Internet 101, which purports to be ''the only rock radio in Russia!'' This turns out to be untrue, as I find at least one other station in Moscow that plays rock music.</p>
        <p>To rock on either of them requires downloading a plug-in. The radio station Internet 101 directs me to a page, operated by Netscape, that contains a list of plug-ins that will work on the site. But when I scroll down to the area that lists the applicable plug-ins, a note informs me there are ''0 matching plug-ins.''</p>
        <p>Giving up on Russian rock, I log on to the Web site of KBCO, a station in Boulder, Colo., where I grew up. In this case, the download goes smoothly and I am soon not just listening to KBCO but watching it. The online programming includes a three-inch screen with animated ''channels'' purporting to correspond to various moods. For instance, the ambience called ''bubble'' features undulating blue bubbles, while ''dizzy'' features blue waves.</p>
        <p>Next, I turn my attention to the controversial music file-sharing service Napster. I really want to give it a try, but I fear I am missing two things and I'm not sure how long it will take to get them. One is the  software, which I must download. The other is a law degree with a specialty in intellectual property.</p>
        <p>I have heard that if I participate on Napster, the recording industry will consider me a thief. But there is the other side of this technological, legal and ethical debate: all the other kids are doing it.</p>
        <p>Alas, I am unable to resolve my feelings on the subject because I fail in repeated efforts to register for Napster. After filling out the registration, I receive the words, ''connecting to server,'' but that connection is never made. My lesson from the second day: music selections online are vast, but the quality and accessibility vary greatly.</p>
        <p>Day 3</p>
        <p>There are numerous sites offering short films, animation and TV-style programming on the Internet.</p>
        <p>First I visit Mediatrip.com, where I watch the acclaimed short film ''George Lucas in Love,'' which is about the real inspiration for the ''Star Wars'' story. The film starts out great. Then it stops. Then it starts. Then it stops.</p>
        <p>During each interruption, I get a message indicating that there is ''Net congestion.'' Then I realize the genius of it all. The constant interruptions have made it an apt metaphor for ''Star Wars'' by turning this five-minute film into its own trilogy.</p>
        <p>I watch a half-dozen other films and short series, including ''Zombie College'' (at www.icebox.com), about a school where life is mostly great except for zombies who eat students' brains after dark.</p>
        <p>The problem in each of these cases is that the programming appears in a three-inch display on my monitor -- roughly 24 inches smaller than my TV. This turns out to be particularly unsettling when watching C-Span, which I am able to view live over the Internet. The announcer instructs viewers who are interested in finding future programming schedules to look at the bottom left of the video screen, which is like telling people to read a flight schedule printed on the side of a passing jet.</p>
        <p>There are a number of Internet-only television programs, too. For instance, there is NASA television! This promises round-the-clock coverage of NASA-related meetings, hearings and . . . Uh, where am I? Oops, sorry, I fell asleep in the middle of that sentence.</p>
        <p>I also discover that numerous television stations nationwide have provided live streams of their local news programming. Out of loyalty to my grandparents, I tune in to KSEE24, their local news station in Fresno, Calif. I am greeted with upsetting news. If I understand the lead story correctly, a fire has broken out at Old Jackie's farmhouse in the nearby town of Dinuba.</p>
        <p>I call my grandmother, who sounds alarmed.</p>
        <p>''A fire broke out at Old Jerry's farm in Denver?'' she asked, suggesting neither the farm nor its locale is particularly significant to the residents. Disconcerting. If the locals can't get excited about their news, maybe those of us hundreds of miles away watching on a three-inch screen should leave well enough alone.</p>
        <p>Say, Grandma, have you heard about the brain-eating zombies?</p>
        <p>Epilogue</p>
        <p>I gather my old-style appliances -- radio, TV and CD player -- in one corner of the room. It's time to take stock of my experience and make a decision.</p>
        <p>This will not be easy. The PC has presented an interesting case, offering a seemingly bottomless array of text, audio and entertainment options. And the international flare is Olympic in scope.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, I'm not sure entertainment should be this hard. I don't want to download, wait or learn a programming language. I want to relax and heed the urge to laugh or cry without having to call for technical support. Simply put, entertainment should be defined as an activity you can do while using both hands to eat snacks. I want to be amused. I don't want to build character.</p>
        <p>And I want to be amused at length. Programs should be more than five minutes. You would have to string about 10 of those animated shorts together to make a sitcom.</p>
        <p>In the end, I am forced to conclude that the PC is something less than the sum of its parts. It is a great utility player, capable of many things, but unable to do any of them as well as a specialist like Roger Clemens. Or my VCR.</p>
        <p>As I turn away, I sense that my computer is sad. It might even want to cry -- but that probably would require a plug-in.</p>
