        <p>The Skyscraper Museum finally has a skyscraper to call its own.</p>
        <p>Since 1997, in exhibitions, books, lectures and Web pages, the museum has chronicled buildings: old buildings and new buildings, famous buildings and common buildings, razed buildings and planned buildings, slender buildings and jumbo buildings.</p>
        <p>Only one thing has been missing. A building.</p>
        <p>Without a permanent home, the embryonic institution has bounced from 44 Wall Street to 16 Wall Street to 110 Maiden Lane (its last  whereabouts as of yesterday evening), depending on the kindness of landlords and the brief availability of empty retail space for temporary rent-free quarters.</p>
        <p>So it was with particular satisfaction that Carol Willis, the founding director of the Skyscraper Museum, bicycled up to the curving concrete shell of the 38-story Ritz-Carlton hotel and condominium apartment tower, now rising at Battery Park City, and pointed to the ground-floor space.</p>
        <p>''This is my corner right here,'' Ms. Willis said.</p>
        <p>At least it will be late next year, when the museum opens, a month or so after the completion of the $200 million Ritz-Carlton project, developed by Millennium Partners on a 70-year land lease from the Battery Park City Authority.</p>
        <p>Through Philip E. Arons, a principal in Millennium and a museum board member, the developers will donate 5,800 square feet to the Skyscraper Museum, space that Mr. Arons estimated would be worth $3 million were it put to retail use.</p>
        <p>Bidders for the hotel site, the southernmost parcel on the 92-acre Battery Park City landfill, were encouraged by the authority to include a public amenity in their plans.</p>
        <p>''One of the reasons Millennium Partners were selected was because of their partnering with the museum,'' said Timothy S. Carey, president and chief executive of the authority. ''We're in essence creating a museum district.''</p>
        <p>Directly across Battery Place from the site of the Skyscraper Museum is the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, which opened in 1997 and is planning an addition. One block north, Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed the Museum of Women: The Leadership Center. The authority will request development proposals for that site early next year, Mr. Carey said.</p>
        <p>Battery Park City was not what Ms. Willis had in mind when she asked Mr. Arons to join the board. She met him in the 1980's when he and her husband, Mark A. Willis, worked in the Koch administration. And she admired the developer's interest in the arts.</p>
        <p>One day in 1997, she recalled, Mr. Arons telephoned. ''He said: 'Hi, Carol. I'm putting the museum in my proposal for Battery Park City. Is that O.K.?' Of course, he knew it would be. It was that simple.''</p>
        <p>But there is nothing simple about trying to tell the towering story of the skyscraper in space the size of a bistro or a duty-free shop.</p>
        <p>That challenge led Roger F. Duffy, an architect in Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, to propose what may be the museum's most striking feature: polished stainless-steel floors and ceilings, a vertical hall of mirrors. Because the display cases will be flush with both surfaces, they will appear to extend limitlessly overhead and under foot; reflection in reflection in reflection.</p>
        <p>''Skyscrapers are always getting bigger, taller, higher,'' Mr. Duffy said. ''Our reflection gives you infinity. There's nothing bigger than that. The vitrines that house the artifacts also become skyscrapers of improbable proportion and infinite height.''</p>
        <p>To keep the ceiling surface uninterrupted, Mr. Duffy is incorporating ambient lighting in the display cases. Cooling and ventilating may take advantage of submarine technology, he said, with conditioned air expelled from high-pressure ducts in the display cases rather than through ceiling diffusers.</p>
        <p>As far as the effect on the floor of foot traffic, Mr. Duffy said visitors might be given scuff-proof booties to wear. ''We're going to make you polish the floors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The reflective theme will be carried over to a 15-foot-long display area on the mezzanine level that will, if the Buildings Department approves, cantilever over the sidewalk. With a two-way mirror at one end and a one-way mirror at the other, this room will give the impression of infinite space.</p>
        <p>Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, which is otherwise busy designing the new New York Stock Exchange, the new Pennsylvania Station and the Time Warner Center on the site of the New York Coliseum, donated its services, worth $300,000 to $400,000, to the Skyscraper Museum.</p>
        <p>Not everything comes free. Ms. Willis is hoping to raise $3.5 million to complete the space and to design and install the permanent exhibition and $2.5 million for an endowment to cover operating expenses on a continuing basis.</p>
        <p>Ms. Willis, 51, a Columbia-trained art historian and an adjunct professor in Columbia's School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, said the design was ''perfectly, poetically fitted'' to the museum, of which she also happens to be curator.</p>
        <p>''The overall idea is breaking the boundaries about a subject that is too large for its space,'' she said. To Ms. Willis, the museum is a starting point, an orientation center for the city's collection of skyscrapers. Owners of landmark towers may expect to hear from her in coming years, as she would like to install vitrines in buildings around town that tell the story of the host structures and, of course, alert viewers to the Skyscraper Museum.</p>
        <p>The museum's identity will be tied not only to its real estate at First Place and Battery Place -- critical though that is for getting into guide books and attracting donors -- but also to its curatorial approach.</p>
        <p>Instead of focusing exclusively on architecture, the museum concerns itself with economics, technology, engineering, personalities, politics and marketing techniques, which also shape the skyline. Looked at this way, a tenant roll can be just as important as a blueprint, a photograph of a typical office module more insightful than a view of the ornate boardroom.</p>
        <p>The first exhibition in 1997, ''Downtown New York: The Architecture of Business/The Business of Buildings,'' was held in space at Wall and William Streets that is now a Charles Schwab brokerage branch. ''Building the Empire State'' (1998-99) and ''Big Buildings'' (1999) were held in a soaring, wood-paneled banking hall at Wall and Nassau Streets that is now an Equinox health club.</p>
        <p>For the moment, the exhibition ''Design/Development: Times Square'' is in a utilitarian former bank branch at Maiden Lane and Pearl Street that the Rudin family has set aside until they sign a paying tenant. (Even after the museum moves out, it can still be found at www.skyscraper.org.)</p>
        <p>''We are happy to provide the space,'' said William C. Rudin, the president of Rudin Management Company. ''New York City should definitely have a Skyscraper Museum.''</p>
        <p>The Rudins are not alone in falling under Ms. Willis's persistent and persuasive spell, as she struggles -- sometimes, it seems, by dint of willpower alone -- to create a new cultural institution out of thin air.</p>
        <p>''The museum lives and breathes because she's devoted her time and energy and has worked for years without any remuneration,'' Mr. Arons said, ''and in my opinion has created an institution of extraordinarily high standards.''</p>
        <p>He said Ritz-Carlton executives were as enthusiastic as he was about the prospect of a museum on the ground floor. ''This might be the kind of thing that would draw people to the hotel on weekends and holidays,'' Mr. Arons said.</p>
        <p>The Ritz-Carlton Downtown will occupy the lower 13 floors of the tower, with 298 rooms. It will have a restaurant, lobby lounge, bar, fitness center and ballroom. The hotel will offer its services to the 122 apartments in the high-rise tower, which will be called the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton. These range in size from 809 to 4,300 square feet and in price from $600,000 to more than $6 million. About 50 have been sold.</p>
        <p>Clearly, for the Skyscraper Museum, institutional adolescence is nearing an end. ''It started with, 'Hey, kids, let's put on a show,' '' Ms. Willis said. ''Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney in a barn. On Wall Street.''</p>
        <p>''We're jumping,'' she said, ''to a whole new scale.''</p>
