        <p>LAST Saturday, The Associated Press sent out a short report datelined Salt Lake City that began with this astounding sentence: ''A passenger who tried to break into the cockpit during a Southwest Airlines flight was killed by other passengers who restrained him, and not by a heart attack, an autopsy has concluded.''</p>
        <p>The report didn't get much attention nationally, even though it drastically revised initial accounts of the Aug. 11 incident, which said that the unruly passenger had died of a heart attack.</p>

        <p>LAST Saturday, The Associated Press sent out a short report datelined Salt Lake City that began with this astounding sentence: ''A passenger who tried to break into the cockpit during a Southwest Airlines flight was killed by other passengers who restrained him, and not by a heart attack, an autopsy has concluded.''</p>
        <p>The report didn't get much attention nationally, even though it drastically revised initial accounts of the Aug. 11 incident, which said that the unruly passenger had died of a heart attack.</p>
        <p>Reading the updated news story, you might have the same reaction as I did, to wit: Excuse me? Passengers on a domestic airline killed someone in mid-August? And we're just now hearing about it?</p>
        <p>If this had happened on a city street, there would be a clamor for the facts. But it happened in the isolated, tightly controlled environment of an airplane. In that case, and given that the death has been ruled a homicide, do the authorities and the airline have a duty to fully inform the public about the circumstances in which 19-year-old Jonathan Burton was beaten, choked and killed aboard Southwest Airlines Flight 1763 from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City on Aug. 11?</p>
        <p>No, say Southwest Airlines and the federal law enforcement authorities who investigated the homicide and decided it didn't warrant criminal prosecution. They are refusing to disclose exactly what happened on that one-hour flight.</p>
        <p>Business travelers are among those frequent fliers who are considered most likely to ultimately witness an incident of ''air rage,'' a loosely defined category that can include anything from an angry verbal exchange with a crew member, to a berserk passenger's attempt to break into the cockpit.</p>
        <p>There isn't any question that the incident was a serious one, or that some passengers and crew members believed that Mr. Burton was acting in a dangerous manner that justified their attempts to physically restrain him until the plane landed.</p>
        <p>Here are facts that aren't in dispute: Mr. Burton of Las Vegas was flying to Salt Lake City to visit a relative when he became involved in an argument with a flight attendant. The situation deteriorated. A group of about eight people on board the plane wrestled with him and restrained him. He died of asphyxiation, an autopsy found. His body had multiple bruises and contusions on the chest, legs, arms and face.</p>
        <p>After the autopsy, the Utah state medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, defined as an intentional act that causes another's death. Subsequently, the United States attorney's office in Salt Lake City decided that there was no evidence of criminal intent, and declined to bring charges.</p>
        <p>The dead man's mother, Janet Burton, didn't know that her son had been suffocated until she obtained the autopsy report last week, said Kent W. Spence, a lawyer who is representing the family. Mr. Spence, who said he had been unable to interview witnesses or get an account of the incident from authorities, said that the dead man had no history of violence, had not been in trouble previously, and was not known to be suffering from any physical or mental illness.</p>
        <p>''When I read an autopsy that says he was placed face down in the aisle, with compression of the neck and torso by multiple individuals; when I read about abrasions of the neck, soft-tissue hemorrhage around the left carotid artery, blunt-force injuries of the face and extremities -- that sounds to me like somebody who got the heck beat out of them,'' Mr. Spence said.</p>
        <p>''It just doesn't make sense to me, under any circumstances, that someone has to die in a situation like this, even if they needed restraint,'' he said. ''I don't have any evidence that he needed restraint, but even if that was the case, especially since there were so many people apparently involved, couldn't they have restrained him without standing on his neck and choking the life out of him? Couldn't Southwest Airlines' flight attendants see that he was unable to breathe and that somebody needed to step in there and say, get off this guy, let him breathe, he's turning blue?''</p>
        <p>Southwest Airlines said its employees acted responsibly in a very difficult situation. ''We stand behind the conduct and actions of our flight crew, and we understand and appreciate the feelings of the passengers on board, including those who took steps to protect themselves and others,'' said Linda Rutherford, a spokeswoman. ''We believe the decision of the U.S. attorney's office not to pursue charges against anyone involved is a good and correct one in this case.''</p>
        <p>She added that ''several'' passengers were involved in restraining Mr. Burton, who she said ''assaulted a couple of passengers'' in the aisle. ''This was a stressful situation resulting from Mr. Burton's repeated attempts to kick through the cockpit door,'' she said. ''The lives of 137 people were in the balance.'' She would not discuss any further details.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence stressed that he wasn't making judgments on the case because he didn't have the facts. But serious questions ought to be answered, he insisted.</p>
        <p>''How did this end up as a killing?'' he asked. ''Strangulation is a slow process, a slow death. What happened? Why won't they just come out and tell us what the facts are? The truth is the truth. Whether there's a potential civil lawsuit or not, why not just let the facts out to fall where they may?''</p>
