      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Good pianists face shrinking prospects on the concert circuit, but the wisest of the good put roots down in academe, travel and perform where the opportunities present themselves. Lori Sims played at Alice Tully Hall on Saturday night in a thoughtfully conceived event. Ms. Sims gave us her thoughts on Schumann's ''Kreisleriana'' and the Beethoven ''Eroica'' Variations, played Sofia Gubaidulina's early Chaconne and chose 7 of Curtis Curtis-Smith's 12 Etudes for Piano. Mr. Curtis-Smith is Ms. Sims's colleague at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo.</p>
        <p>She is a satisfying performer. The technique is big and powerful, tending toward the heavy-handed when pressed by such fearsome pieces as the Schumann Toccata but capable of considerable delicacy as well. More important, Ms. Sims's phrases make sense. The proportions are nicely calculated and sincerely articulated, and there is never a hint of the self-aggrandizing effect or the superfluous musical gesture. She showed further wisdom by playing Mr. Curtis-Smith's etudes out of order and ending with No. 5: a reticent, flowing piece and perhaps the most affecting of the lot.</p>

        <p>She is a satisfying performer. The technique is big and powerful, tending toward the heavy-handed when pressed by such fearsome pieces as the Schumann Toccata but capable of considerable delicacy as well. More important, Ms. Sims's phrases make sense. The proportions are nicely calculated and sincerely articulated, and there is never a hint of the self-aggrandizing effect or the superfluous musical gesture. She showed further wisdom by playing Mr. Curtis-Smith's etudes out of order and ending with No. 5: a reticent, flowing piece and perhaps the most affecting of the lot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curtis-Smith is a careful student of past innovators at the piano. The textures and movement recall Chopin and Debussy and yet the language is at a distance from their diatonic moorings. This contemporary composer likes dense brittle chords, chiming ornamentation and is happy to uses popular music and jazz as undercurrents. These are interesting pieces.</p>
        <p>The Gubaidulina is dark and militant, filled with marching chords and urgent virtuosity. The rhetoric is taken wholly from the past, and with much more literalness than the Curtis-Smith Etudes. Indeed, the Chaconne operates as parallel universes. The form advertises classic modulations and big dominant-tonic climaxes; the music itself plays altogether different notes, offering a kind of dissonant parody to accompany the older language.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sims's audience was attentive and of a very decent size. Its members seemed to know her or know her work. As a much decorated veteran of the competition wars (including a 1998 first prize at the Gina Bachauer International Competition in Salt Lake City) Ms. Sims may still be aiming high, but from my brief glimpse of her, she already has a career to emulate. Her playing was a pleasure to hear, and it is comforting to think that such sound judgment and high standards are being passed on to her students.</p>
