        <p>The details were sordid: A leading judge on the Irish Supreme Court, a 40-year veteran of the bench and a onetime candidate for chief justice, was accused of arranging the early parole hearing and eventual release of a family acquaintance who had been convicted of killing a young mother while driving drunk.</p>
        <p>The judge denied doing anything improper but refused to cooperate with a parliamentary investigation. In April 1999, threatened with impeachment, he resigned.</p>
        <p>But one year later, he found himself nominated by the government for a job with the European Investment Bank, complete with a $161,000 salary. The former judge, Hugh O'Flaherty, 61, might not have had the financial experience typical for most top officials at the bank, but he accepted the nomination.</p>
        <p>The Irish people, however, did not. The nomination, made in May by the finance minister, was widely perceived as an act of the dominant political party, Fianna Fail, in looking after one of its own. The resulting wave of public anger eventually forced Mr. O'Flaherty to withdraw.</p>
        <p>Last week, the government nominated a replacement, a lifelong civil servant from the finance ministry. But the affair has undermined confidence in the government, which is drawing more criticism than at any other time during its three years.</p>
        <p>The bank position is one of more than 2,000 jobs that the government distributes each time a new administration takes office. According to Dermot Keogh, professor of history at University College Cork, such appointments have little to do with qualifications.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Flaherty's nomination failed when the public reaction made its way to the bank's headquarters in Luxembourg, prompting officials there to notify the government that for the first time, they would reject a government's nominee.</p>
        <p>As soon as the nomination became known, an editorial in The Irish Times declared that ''the public's confidence in the institutions of the state is at rock bottom,'' and that the nomination ''betrays the whole concept of accountability in a democracy.''</p>
        <p>In June opposition parties offered a no-confidence motion in the parliament, which the government survived by a handful of votes. In July, a legal challenge to the nomination by a teacher from Limerick reached the Supreme Court before it was rejected. But it succeeded in stalling the process for months, and encouraged more than a dozen Irish citizens to apply for the job directly with the bank, and countless more to send letters of protest.</p>
        <p>Facing a tide of angry voters, the government simply stuck to its guns, although Prime Minister Bertie Ahern called on Mr. O'Flaherty to explain the 1998 scandal.</p>
        <p>''The government was doggedly and persistently insisting on ignoring public opinion,'' said Tom O'Malley, a law lecturer at the National University of Ireland in Galway.</p>
        <p>''Arrogance'' became the most common term used to describe the man initially behind the nomination, Finance Minister Charlie McCreevy. Mr. McCreevy refused to acknowledge any problems with the appointment until after Mr. O'Flaherty withdrew, when he held a rare news conference to admit that he had ''got it wrong.''</p>
        <p>Professor Keogh said he hoped the affair would fuel cries for government reform. One such change could see the introduction of parliamentary hearings to approve political appointments. ''It won't go away,'' he said. ''It's one of these issues that has deeper public ramifications.''</p>
