        <p>Chancellor to Receive Housing Stipend</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor HAROLD O. LEVY has still not signed his contract with the Board of Education, but one of the most contentious details has been settled: his housing allowance. Board officials said Mr. Levy will get about $9,000 a month for housing even though he owns his apartment on the Upper West Side. He asked for the stipend because previous chancellors had lived free in a board-owned town house in Brooklyn. The board plans to put the town house up for rent and use the proceeds for the stipend.</p>

        <p>Sites for Schools in Bronx and Queens</p>
        <p>The Board of Education and the School Construction Authority have settled on sites for two new elementary schools in District 29 in southeastern Queens and two specialized high schools in Queens and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The board will ask the City Council to approve its buying property for Public School 270, a 700-seat elementary school at 234th Street and Merrick Boulevard; P.S. 268, a similarly sized school on Jamaica Avenue between 175th and 176th Streets; the High School for Hospitality and Business Management, a 1,360-seat school on 20th Avenue between 45th and 46th Streets in Queens; and the High School for Law, Government and Justice, a 730-seat school on Sherman Avenue at 163rd Street in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Director of Parent Advocacy Replaced</p>
        <p>Saying that the Board of Education has not done enough to encourage parent involvement, Schools Chancellor HAROLD O. LEVY has removed MICHAEL CARTER as director of the office of parent advocacy. He was replaced by JAMAL L. YOUNG, assistant to BIRDIE BLAKE-REID, director of funded and community services.</p>
