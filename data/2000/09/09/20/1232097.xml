        <p>The parabuilding, a new addition to an older structure, continues to entrench itself as a vibrantly contemporary architectural type. The Brooklyn Museum of Art has unveiled the genre's most recent example: a monumental main entrance for the museum's Eastern Parkway facade.</p>
        <p>Designed by James Stewart Polshek of the Polshek Partnership, architects of the Rose Earth and Space Center at the American Museum of Natural History, the project draws its visual impact from the contrast between its assertively modern forms and the museum's classical Beaux-Arts design. But the architectural value of this parabuilding lies in the stunning rigor with which it reveals the founding principles of the Beaux-Arts School.</p>
        <p>The $55 million project, which was presented yesterday before the city Landmarks Preservation Commission, replaces the long-vanished staircase originally designed by McKim, Mead &amp; White for their 1897 building. The stairway was amputated when the entrance lobby was demoted from the building's piano nobile, on the third floor, to its decidedly ignoble basement. The surgery left scars: a blank-faced entrance, with classical columns dangling their feet in the air overhead.</p>
        <p>The new design grows out of the 1986 master plan developed by the Polshek Partnership in collaboration with Arata Isozaki &amp; Associates of Tokyo. As much a work of landscape as of architecture, the design is an asymmetrical composition that plays against the classical symmetry of the museum's facade.</p>
        <p>The semicircular plan radiates outward from the center of the existing stone facade. Its most conspicuous feature is a roof of clear glass that sweeps across the facade in a series of ascending, overlapping arcs. A finely tuned engineering system of metal struts and cables holds the glass aloft.</p>
        <p>The museum's main lobby, which is to be completely remodeled, lies directly beneath the roof. It is entered from the right side, as you face the building, through a row of bronze-and-glass doors. The remainder of the project fans outward from the entrance lobby in an arrangement of outdoor public spaces that extend the semicircular shape toward Eastern Parkway. Proceeding around the semicircle from left to right, these include a sloping lawn, an amphitheater for outdoor performances, a fountain of towering, vertical plumes, and expanse of grass steps, in effect a park in the shape of a ziggurat.</p>
        <p>The steps are interrupted by a grand, ceremonial walkway that leads from Eastern Parkway and the subway entrance to the museum's front door. A passerelle, or aerial promenade, skirts the perimeter of the glass roof, creating something of a U.F.O. silhouette.</p>
        <p>This concept reverses the hierarchical associations of the traditional Beaux-Arts stairway. Instead of symbolizing an ascent into the privileged realm of high culture, the design transforms the steps into people places. In addition to leading the eye toward the museum's entrance, the design invites visitors to sit down and gaze outward toward the parkway and neighboring Crown Heights.</p>
        <p>This panorama deserves to be seen as a work of art in itself: Eastern Parkway, designed by Olmsted and Vaux in 1870-74, was the first parkway built in the United States. The adjacent Prospect Park, which Olmsted and Vaux considered more successful than their Central Park, is a landmark in the physical engineering of modern democracy. Polshek's parabuilding reflects a fundamental change in the relationship between the museum and the community. Rather than a self-contained entity secure behind its rows of classical columns, the museum now exercises centrifugal force. But it reinvigorates the democratic ethos of the 19th-century park movement.</p>
        <p>As many New Yorkers are aware, the Brooklyn Museum of Art represents only a fraction of the building originally envisioned by Charles McKim. In the grandiose spirit of the Gilded Age this was intended to be the largest museum in the world. The dome that rises over the museum's portico is one of a quartet that were designed to surround the building's central space, an immense rotunda surmounted by a hemisphere twice the height as the one actually built.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polshek and Mr. Isozaki derived their inspiration for the semicircular plan from a staircase designed by McKim for an eastern entrance to the building. Like that earlier scheme, the Polshek design echoes the dome motif. For the historically minded the design also recalls the Salle des Prix, a room at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the progenitor of the values for which McKim, Mead &amp; White are known. We must look to this room, and the ideas issued from it, to appreciate the intelligence of the Polshek design.</p>
        <p>The room, also known as the hemicycle, has been described by the historian Joseph Rykwert as the school's ''spiritual center.'' It was here that students were indoctrinated with ideas first enunciated in the early 19th century by Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Rykwert has written, Durand was a child of the Enlightenment and the Revolution. He was a rationalist, that is to say, a man who believed that architecture should be subject to laws as strict, logical and absolute as those governing science. He proposed that abstract geometric forms, like those used by Newton in his scientific calculations, be adapted for architectural use. Of these the circle and the sphere symbolized supreme perfection. That is the idea represented in the semicircular form of the Salle de Prix, in the dome of the Brooklyn Museum's rotunda and in the new Polshek design.</p>
        <p>To the uneducated eye the Polshek design may at first appear to violate the classical tradition evoked by McKim's Beaux-Arts building. In fact, as Mr. Rykwert has persuasively argued, that tradition was shattered by the Beaux-Arts itself.</p>
        <p>Durand's insistence on abstract geometric form introduced a novel and wholly ahistorical approach to architectural design. When he and his pupils employed the classical orders, their intention was not to reinforce continuity with the past. Rather they believed that the orders were suited to serve the transcendent ideal of absolute reason. Neither the Greeks, nor Vitruvius, nor Alberti and the great builders of the Renaissance would have understood this approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polshek has. He has grasped it more firmly than McKim, Mead &amp; White. The Brooklyn Museum is a steel-framed building. The structure adheres to a far more rational logic than the stone facades laid atop it. By exposing the structure of the parabuilding, Mr. Polshek has revealed the rational system that enables the museum to stand up.</p>
        <p>More important, it coaxes into full view the ideal of geometric abstraction articulated in the Salle des Prix. By a happy bit of symbolism, the museum's classical columns will appear to rise from the abstract, transparent semicircle of the new roof, as if the founding ideas of the Beaux-Arts have at least been accorded their proper place.</p>
        <p>Something else will undoubtedly be coaxed into view by this thoughtful, handsome design: the intolerance of knee-jerk preservationists toward new works that exhibit a far more profound grasp of the tradition they claim to represent. When the clamor dies down, it will be seen that the Brooklyn Museum is a living institution that has added a major new work to its collection.</p>
        <p>In the meantime we should keep in mind Mr. Rykwert's observation on the Beaux-Arts school and its impact on classical architecture: ''The Ecole des Beaux-Arts has stood for a century and a half as an all-too-solid monument to the classical tradition. But some of us think that if it were dismantled, the tomb might turn out to have been empty all the time.''</p>
