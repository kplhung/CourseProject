        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign began broadcasting this 30-second advertisement last night.</p>
        <p>TITLE -- ''Stand Up''</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Team Hillary</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The ad features clips of Mrs. Clinton in the various situations mentioned in the script, including meeting with schoolchildren, visiting a hospital and speaking in China. It also shows the cover of her book ''It Takes a Village.'' The words ''fought,'' ''worked,'' ''spoke out'' and ''gave'' appear with the camera shots.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- ''They tried to get her to back down on teacher testing. She wouldn't. They tried to make her give up after health care reform failed. She kept working. They tried to silence her in China. But she spoke out for women's rights as human rights. They criticized her book about children. She took the proceeds, nearly $1 million, and gave it to children. All her life, Hillary has stood up for what she believes in. For better schools, better health care. Now she'll stand up for us.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Mrs. Clinton has run into roadblocks during her public life, including teachers in Arkansas in the 1970's who opposed competency tests, members of Congress who defeated her plan in 1994 to overhaul health care, the Chinese authorities who accused her of meddling in 1995, and conservative Republicans who criticized her book in 1996 as too light on family values. Mrs. Clinton's opponents say the list of conflicts is a stain on her career, not something to boast about, but they do not dispute the ad's central claim that she did not give up on the causes.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The ad, which is paid for by her campaign, not the soft-money committees that support her, builds on Mrs. Clinton's post-debate effort to depict herself as a victim who despite great odds sticks to her principles and fights for the right thing. It dovetails with her insistent refrain that her opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, takes his marching orders from the Republican leadership and has no grounding of his own. Positive and sunny, it projects the feel-good Mrs. Clinton while strongly suggesting that the bad guys are out to get her. By using the word ''they,'' instead of naming her critics, it also creates the impression of a common, conspiratorial enemy, when, in fact, her detractors were quite varied.</p>
