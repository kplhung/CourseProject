        <p>Face to face with 300 of their most generous contributors, Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman muted their criticism of the entertainment industry on Monday night as they sought to reassure Hollywood that their calls for stricter marketing practices were not an effort to squelch creativity.</p>
        <p>''We will nudge you,'' Mr. Lieberman, the vice-presidential nominee, said gently. ''But we will never become censors.''</p>
        <p>''Al and I have tremendous regard for this industry,'' Mr. Lieberman added. ''We're both fans of the products that come out of the entertainment industry -- not all of them, but a lot of them. And the industry has entertained and inspired and educated us over the years. And it's true from time to time we will have been, will be, critics, or noodges, but I promise you this: We will never never put the government in the position of telling you by law, through law, what to make.''</p>
        <p>He and Mr. Gore spoke from a stage set up under a huge white tent on the fairway-size lawn of Ron Burkle, the supermarket magnate and longtime Democratic contributor.</p>
        <p>And the crowd of Southern California moguls, magnates and marquee names responded by giving $4.2 million to the Democratic National Committee, a record amount for a political fund-raising dinner at a private home. Among the guests were actors like Tom Hanks and Dustin Hoffman, studio executives like Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks, Alan Horn of Warner Brothers and Robert K. Shaye of New Line Cinema and comedians like Garry Shandling, Paul Reiser and Larry David.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was a bit more circumspect than Mr. Lieberman in his comments, praising Rob Reiner, the director, for paving the way for their visit and referring obliquely to ''the controversy of the previous week.''</p>
        <p>That ''controversy'' was the threat by Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman that, if elected, they would take action against industry executives who did not ''clean up their act'' on marketing violent movies, music and video games to children within six months.  Mr. Gore said then that his administration would seek sanctions through legislation or regulatory action against the industry for deceptive advertising practices.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman began their push just over a week ago, they have been attacked by their Republican opponents as hypocrites for chastising Hollywood by day and taking its money by night.</p>
        <p>Dick Cheney, the Republican vice presidential nominee, said that Mr. Gore was raising ''millions of dollars from the same media moguls who are corrupting our children.'' The entertainment industry is the fifth-biggest contributor to Democratic campaigns.</p>
        <p>In response, the Gore campaign said the point Mr. Gore and Mr. Lieberman were making was essentially the one they had been making in recent weeks. ''Al Gore and Joe Leiberman will not hesitate to tell their friends and supporters when they're wrong,'' said Mark Fabiani, a spokesman for Mr. Gore. ''This message has been consistently delivered loud and clear. Just because they went to the event doesn't obscure the point.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Lieberman said in his Congressional testimony on Sept. 13 that he and Mr. Gore were talking about voluntary measures first, governmental regulation second and legislation only as a last resort.</p>
        <p>But before the studio executives on Monday night, any talk of regulation was gone, as was the stern tone. Rather than focus on Hollywood's marketing practices, they focused on their shared values as parents seeking to ''do what's right'' for their children.</p>
        <p>''It's true that we feel strongly about the responsibility that the entertainment industries need to take when it comes to marketing inappropriate material to children,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Joe and I believe this very deeply. And if I'm entrusted with the presidency, we're going to fight to change that. And I know a lot of you will be standing with us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reiner, who has worked assiduously on Mr. Gore's behalf and helped organize the fund-raiser on Monday, delivered a similar message.</p>
        <p>''We don't only have our parochial interests at heart,'' Mr. Reiner told the contributors, with Mr. Gore seated nearby. ''We care about the same things that all Americans care about. We care about making sure our children get a good education, we care about making sure that we have health care. We care about a woman's right to choose, about protecting the environment and making sure that we have meaningful gun-control laws.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''That's the reason we're supporting Vice President Gore and Senator Lieberman, because they are in sync with us on all of these issues.''</p>
        <p>The audience had been warmed up with music by members of the Eagles and endless Jewish jokes. Mr. Lieberman, who has made Catskill humor a part of his stump appearances, told the gathering at one point that ''my rabbi, Jesse Jackson, is here tonight.'' And his comfort level appeared high as he thanked Mr. Reiner for trying to bridge the gap between Hollywood and the real world.</p>
        <p>''In addition to doing the creative work that you do, in addition to being producers, and directors and actors and actresses and writers, you are parents, you are citizens,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''Your support here tonight really moves and encourages me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said: ''I thought, Rob, you put it exactly right in talking about all of the things that we have in common.'' He spoke at length, but mostly about other subjects. He mentioned his support for abortion rights three times and emphasized that the next president could appoint three or four new justices to the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>And as a student of stagecraft, he could not help but comment on an earlier moment in the evening, when Carl and Rob Reiner, father and son, crossing each other on stage, had embraced and kissed.</p>
        <p>''Incidentally,'' Mr. Gore said, ''the only thing I would change -- when you two kissed up here? You might want to hold that a little longer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was headed tonight to another fund-raising dinner, this one in Silicon Valley, where he was expected to raise more than $3 million.</p>
