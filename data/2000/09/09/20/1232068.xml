        <p>EVERY Mexican restaurant above the taco-stand level must answer a fundamental question at the outset. Will it take the pledge and swear to serve fine food, with a respect for regional differences and prime ingredients, or will it saunter down the cash-strewn path to Margaritaville?</p>
        <p>Rosa Mexicano, the Lincoln Center offshoot of Rosa Mexicano on First Avenue, tries to be virtuous. ''As Rosa Mexicano presents classic Mexican cuisine,'' the menu warns, ''some of the popularized Americanized dishes often associated with Mexican food are not included on our menu.'' No burritos here, in other words. No combination platters. Dishes are listed in Spanish first, English second.</p>

        <p>EVERY Mexican restaurant above the taco-stand level must answer a fundamental question at the outset. Will it take the pledge and swear to serve fine food, with a respect for regional differences and prime ingredients, or will it saunter down the cash-strewn path to Margaritaville?</p>
        <p>Rosa Mexicano, the Lincoln Center offshoot of Rosa Mexicano on First Avenue, tries to be virtuous. ''As Rosa Mexicano presents classic Mexican cuisine,'' the menu warns, ''some of the popularized Americanized dishes often associated with Mexican food are not included on our menu.'' No burritos here, in other words. No combination platters. Dishes are listed in Spanish first, English second.</p>
        <p>It all sounds admirably high-minded, but then you hear the slurping sound of a thousand slushy cocktails going down the hatch, the din of euphoric young voices lubricated with premium tequila, and there you are: cruising in an aqua convertible with Jimmy Buffett.</p>
        <p>But there are worse ways to pass the time. Overall, the cooking at Rosa Mexicano is pallid and dull. It lacks the snap and the vibrancy that make Mexican cuisine approachable and popular. The kitchen seems incapable of getting food to the table hot. The use of spices is timid, and it's hard not to feel that the menu has been smoothed out to avoid giving offense. It's Latin without passion or flair, but with enough bright spots along the way to offer hope.</p>
        <p>The best comes first. When a guacamole cart comes rolling by, hail it. Specify the degree of hotness you want. Then watch as the cart superintendent constructs a superlative avocado experience, layer by layer, mashing ingredients in the traditional lava-stone molcajete, and achieving the perfect creamy-lumpy balance.</p>
        <p>It would be tempting, but a mistake, to order ceviche next. There are two varieties, red snapper in a citrus, tomato and jalapeno marinade, and a sweeter mixed seafood ceviche of scallops, baby shrimp and squid marinated in lemon juice, mango, honeydew and red peppers. There is very little margin for error in ceviche. Seafood can wind up either too tough or mushy, and at Rosa Mexicano it usually does.</p>
        <p>Among other appetizers, flabby ravioli filled with chicken, tomato and onion float serenely in a peculiar sauce made with poblano chilies and Champagne, dotted here and there with islands of melted manchego cheese.</p>
        <p>For whatever reason, the kitchen seems most successful with deep, earthy flavors. A small appetizer casserole of sauteed mushrooms, tomatoes and onions is flavored with garlic, serrano chilies and the pungent herb epazote. The entire savory mess lies on a moist bed of cornmeal, a neutral layer with just the right counterbalancing sweetness. Huitlacoche (here spelled cuitlacoche), Mexico's renowned corn fungus, shows its dark, smoky splendor after being sauteed with onions, garlic,  chilies and epazote and simply placed on a crisp tortilla chip. The one fish success story among the appetizers is the tacos de pescado, small tortillas filled with crisp pieces of pan-fried lenguado, or rex sole, topped with a tangy lemon-jalapeno dressing.</p>
        <p>The menu makes a fuss over its main courses from the grill. They are unexceptional. Hefty skewered shrimp, marinated in garlic vinaigrette and served over rice with onions, tomatoes and serrano chilies, are slightly dry but otherwise inoffensive. Tuna makes a better showing. It comes in thick steaklike chunks marinated in achiote and bitter orange and then topped with pickled onions.</p>
        <p>The nongrilled entrees make, at most, a mildly pleasing impression, except for an appalling lamb shank coated in pasilla, ancho and guajillo chilies and then steamed in a parchment bag. It looks like an oversize, stew-filled beggar's purse. Steaming, strangely enough, does not take the toughness out of the lamb. Red snapper Veracruz style, baked in a tomato sauce flavored with capers, poblanos and green olives, has almost enough personality to linger in the memory, and huitlacoche comes to the rescue once again, this time in the stuffing of a chicken roulade covered in poblano chili sauce. The budin azteca, a layered tortilla pie filled with shredded chicken and cacciota cheese, has a sort of fascinating blandness, like Charles Grodin, that makes it stand out from the featureless landscape of chicken with mole sauce, enchiladas with mole sauce, and shrimp crepes topped with mild chili sauce and melted cheese.</p>
        <p>Desserts are very sweet and very forgettable, except for the delicia de chocolate, a tall column of velvety mousse resting on a crunchy chocolate and peanut butter disk. The coffee flan, on my first visit, was also an exception: it was the worst I have ever eaten in my life. I ordered it a second time, and it had made a giant leap to mediocrity.</p>
        <p>David Rockwell's design for the restaurant has a splashy exuberance that's missing from the food. The colors tingle and vibrate, and he outdoes himself in the restaurant's most memorable feature, a glittering blue tile wall with a thin sheet of water running over its two-story surface. Up and down the wall, hundreds of little white plaster divers are deployed in precise ranks, ready to spring outward. Maybe they're trying to jump ship.</p>
