        <p>The Rev. Reginald T. Jackson knows how to move an audience, whether it is the parishioners of his congregation in Orange, N.J., or a nation outraged by allegations of racial profiling on the New Jersey Turnpike.</p>
        <p>As director of the Black Ministers Council, which represents 600 churches statewide, Mr. Jackson's relentless agitation helped spur an investigation into the systematic stopping of black and Hispanic motorists and led to the firing of the state police superintendent, Carl A. Williams, for disparaging comments about blacks.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jackson and the council's reputation as a nonpartisan advocate for racial justice may have been compromised by the disclosure yesterday that he accepted money from Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, four months before giving Mr. Corzine his influential endorsement.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Jackson says the $25,000 contribution helped pay for the opening of council offices in Trenton, he and Mr. Corzine remained silent when a reporter asked about such contributions last April. At the time, several ministers angrily objected to the suggestion that they would accept money from a political candidate.</p>
        <p>No one has accused Mr. Jackson of any wrongdoing, but some black leaders say his acceptance of Mr. Corzine's generosity could hurt the council's ability to navigate the state's political waters. Politically savvy but strenuously independent, Mr. Jackson has been admired for his ability to work with both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>''It somehow gives the idea that there was a quid pro quo, that political favors were exchanged for money,'' said Walter Fields Jr., a former president of the N.A.A.C.P. in New Jersey who once worked for Jim Florio, the Democrat who lost to Mr. Corzine last June. ''It compromises your ability to speak forcefully. People look at you cross-eyed.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview from Boston, where he was attending a conference, Mr. Jackson said he regretted not revealing the source of the donation sooner, but said he did not because the money came from Mr. Corzine's charitable foundation, not his political campaign. He also said he feared that disclosing Mr. Corzine's name might improperly influence some of the 20 council members who later endorsed him. ''In hindsight, I wish I had spoken up sooner,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he rejected suggestions that the episode would compromise his independence. ''If you take a look at my record, there have been politicians I have been close to personally and I have supported and endorsed and with whom I later disagreed with,'' he said. ''I am not for sale. Black preachers are not for sale.''</p>
        <p>But many of his colleagues said they were troubled by the incident. The Rev. Calvin McKinney, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Garfield and one of the council members who said he had not accepted money from Mr. Corzine during the April news conference, said he was angry that he was left in the dark. ''I stood there flat footed, standing my ground, and the two of them didn't tell me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinney said he did not think the group's reputation would be harmed by the episode, however. ''If there's any credibility that's going to be shot, it's probably Reggie Jackson that will face the brunt of it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the two years since four unarmed basketball players were shot and wounded by state troopers on the turnpike, Mr. Jackson, 46, has emerged as the state's most prominent black leader. He is skilled at dealing with the press and with politicians, who value his support at election time. ''He is probably the top spokesman for African-Americans in New Jersey,'' said Richard J. Codey, a state senator from Essex County. ''As far as I'm concerned, he's beyond reproach.''</p>
        <p>Several ministers and elected officials said they thought excessive attention had been placed on Mr. Jackson, who they said should be praised for keeping Mr. Corzine's donation anonymous. Other criticized the suggestion that Mr. Jackson controls the state's black vote.</p>
        <p>''Parishioners aren't going to vote for John Doe because the pastor says so,'' said the Rev. M. William Howard Jr., the pastor of Bethany Baptist Church in Newark. ''That's just not the way it works.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson suggested that he was being singled out, and asked why other religious leaders have not been grilled about charitable donations from candidates. ''It's a double standard,'' he said. ''There's a stigma on black ministers.''</p>
        <p>That stigma was raised after the 1993 gubernatorial race, when Ed Rollins, Christine Todd Whitman's campaign manager, attributed her victory to black ministers who, he said, had been paid to discourage  parishioners from voting. Mr. Rollins boasted that the campaign had secretly spent $500,000 on the effort, which helped give Mrs. Whitman her narrow margin of victory over Mr.  Florio, a Democrat. Mr. Rollins later retracted his statement, but it still haunts black political leaders.</p>
        <p>''We just can't seem to escape that age old notion that black ministers can be bought off,'' Mr. McKinney said. ''I wish it would go away.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 21, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, director of the Black Ministers Council in New Jersey, which has campaigned against racial profiling by the state police, misstated the number of black and Hispanic men shot and wounded by state troopers during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in April 1998. It was three, not four.</p>
