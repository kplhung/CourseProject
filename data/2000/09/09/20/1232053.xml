        <p>A YEAR ago, Suzanne Richie embarked on her Internet adventure.</p>
        <p>A former photo editor at The New York Times, Ms. Richie had quit her job and begun selling antiques -- in particular, early-American pattern glass -- from her home in Woodstock, N.Y.</p>
        <p>She also had a booth at the nearby Coxsackie Antiques Center, sold items on eBay and had just started a Web site, www. richieantiques.com, featuring her best glass items and other merchandise.</p>
        <p>Much -- and little -- has changed in the intervening year. Ms. Richie estimated that it had cost about $7,000 to design and maintain the Web site, with revenue, so far, of only about $1,000. Still, she thinks that the Web site is valuable.</p>
        <p>''It is my front man,'' Ms. Richie said. ''It gives me legitimacy, credibility and a professional look. It's like a portfolio. You have to have it.''</p>
        <p>Searching for the right formula and perhaps even profitability, she has substantially revised her online offerings. The focus of the site is now strictly glass, replacing the miscellaneous antiques that Ms. Richie now thinks cluttered her site. She also added an electronic shopping cart and a free e-commerce service to handle transactions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Richie said that she viewed her Web site with equal parts fondness and exasperation. It is her showcase, the place where she displays her finest pieces, not to mention her expertise.</p>
        <p>Yet, she said, ''Keeping it up to date is a challenge.''</p>
