        <p>IF you are unsure about which of the 100 different flower arrangements at Proflowers.com is right for you, just ask Emily.</p>
        <p>Emily is the very picture of a smiling, helpful sales associate. She will ask whom the flowers are for and how much you want to spend. She will also ask whether there is a special reason for the purchase and will go so far as to ask if you are sending flowers because you are ''in the doghouse.'' Then she will suggest a few arrangements from the inventory and warn you if you have ordered too late for delivery on a particular date.</p>

        <p>IF you are unsure about which of the 100 different flower arrangements at Proflowers.com is right for you, just ask Emily.</p>
        <p>Emily is the very picture of a smiling, helpful sales associate. She will ask whom the flowers are for and how much you want to spend. She will also ask whether there is a special reason for the purchase and will go so far as to ask if you are sending flowers because you are ''in the doghouse.'' Then she will suggest a few arrangements from the inventory and warn you if you have ordered too late for delivery on a particular date.</p>
        <p>Yet if Emily is the picture of helpfulness, she is also literally a picture. Down deep, she is a complex assortment of logic exercises, HTML code and market research. She is the Web's equivalent of a department store's personal shopper -- a cybercreation that can assist you in your buying, recall your preferences and notify you when something goes on sale. She is an electronic agent who performs what analysts call ''guided selling,'' or ''directed selling,'' in which a Web site answers questions and advises buyers on a purchase. If this were software, it might be called ''Salesman in a Box.''</p>
        <p>The Internet has evolved into an effective hunting guide for online shoppers. In addition to obtaining prices, shoppers can learn whether an item is in stock, immediately available and comparable to other items on the site or on the Web. In short, the Web is maturing as an adviser, not just a bargain finder.</p>
        <p>Emily is the creation of Kana Communications of Manchester, N.H., a company that focuses on ways to link customers and companies on the Web. ''People want to buy from people,'' explained Stefania Nappi, a Kana vice president. ''The question they want answered is, 'Tell me why.' If you didn't need help, you wouldn't be looking for information.''</p>
        <p>Besides wanting their questions answered in a nuanced and detailed way, customers want to associate purchases with a seller. The reasons range from a basic desire for personal attention to the option of after-sales contact and follow-up. The electronic adviser could be a fictional character like the bearded Dudley caricature who dispenses technical advice for Dell Computer, or it could be identified with a photo of an actual sales clerk whom shoppers could also call or visit.</p>
        <p>Proflowers.com has seen sales soar to double or even triple the usual average when a significant number of visitors consult the adviser, Ms. Nappi said.</p>
        <p>The electronic advisers can only suggest purchases based on each company's inventory, Ms. Nappi said. In the future, though, she envisions sellers, and even third-party sites, that will be able to offer advice about products whether they offer them or not. The goal, she said, is to win customers and loyalty by offering service comparable to that provided by the fabled retailer Nordstrom. Sites like BizRate.com already offer advice on which shopping sites different types of users might prefer, so extending that knowledge to the products is the logical next step.</p>
        <p>''Personalization'' is the term that is preferred by Matthew W. Calkins, the chief executive of the Appian Corporation of Falls Church, Va., a consulting firm that advises companies on the systems that facilitate personal interaction online. Some examples are filters that can ask users which books or movies people like and correlate the results to create profiles. Mr. Calkins points out, however, that for less frequent purchases,  like vehicles, homes or appliances, a consumer's needs or circumstances play a greater role than their tastes.</p>
        <p>Simple electronic systems exist that can, for example, identify buyers of computer printers at the point of purchase. But they cannot yet persuade a customer to buy a more expensive model or make a related purchase, like a savvy, experienced salesman who might offer deals on paper, ink cartridges or cables. Nor have these electronic systems made the leap into decisions like helping users choose which type of paper or length of cable is best for their needs.</p>
        <p>''Personalization as a technology is not yet where people hoped it would be,'' Mr. Calkins said. ''Assumptions made from data mining or other review of sales data can be misleading. Price is just not the sine qua non of Internet retailing. There's so much more contextual information.''</p>
        <p>While still in its infancy, personalization is more useful to buyers than to sellers, counters Chris Selland, vice president for e-business strategies at the Yankee Group, a telecommunications research and consulting firm in Boston. ''It is important and it does add value, but it's being overhyped,'' Mr. Selland said. ''When a customer is on your Web site in a buying mood, you're not selling. They're buying. The Internet was built for research, not for commerce, and that's how people are using it.''</p>
        <p>Just as the shortcomings of voice mail versus live receptionists took time to determine, Web retailers are trying to find the ideal combination of automated and live assistants. Retailers are adding features like ''click to chat'' with a live person or ''click to talk'' to schedule a call from a sales agent. And the debate over which personalization tools to use is as robust as the different methods for achieving it.</p>
        <p>Kana's software uses several basic questions to elicit some information about each buyer. Using logic devised by an English mathematician, Thomas Bayes, in the 18th century, it links those responses to a larger database of profiles to intuit details to questions that have not been asked.</p>
        <p>Bayes's logic exercises are being rediscovered by companies like Microsoft as a way to bridge the chasm between having too much information about a customer, like the entire transaction history, and not enough useful details. Bayes's theorem is the mathematical law governing logical inference. It determines what degree of confidence to have in possible conclusions based on limited evidence.</p>
        <p>Other companies are using natural-language search tools, hoping to humanize shopping. Through Soliloquy, based in New York, Web users can speak, through voice or keyboard, with electronic ''experts'' to help them select items.</p>
        <p>There are also combination efforts like the one used by the Calico Corporation, which teams search engines with adviser software. Another strategy personalizes transactions by using shared information from a company's disparate divisions or product lines, bringing together credit limits, past transactions, preferences and other details to create a custom transaction that can be delivered by e-mail, phone or personal digital assistant.</p>
        <p>For example, www.oneswoop.com helps buyers in the United Kingdom compare, choose, order and finance cars from other European countries online.</p>
        <p>As with any data trail, assumptions made from data mining or past sales can be misleading. Merchants do not want to know what was bought, they want to know why. And personalization, like customer service, is interpreted differently by everyone who experiences it.</p>
        <p>''People are realizing there are commodity markets, but even in commodities there are quality concerns,'' said Christopher Meyer, the director of the Cap Gemini-Ernst &amp; Young Center for Business Innovation. ''The ability to start the conversation online, where buyers and sellers can express their wants, needs, budgets and other concerns, will expand the attention that can be paid to even the most routine transaction.''</p>
