        <p>An electrical fire in a train tunnel under the East River caused a brief shutdown and extensive rush-hour delays on the Long Island Rail Road last night and sent smoke billowing into Pennsylvania Station, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Russ Hall, a spokesman for Amtrak, which operates the tunnel, said that it might not be reopened until after the start of the morning rush, which could wreak havoc for commuters.</p>
        <p>The fire, in one of the four tunnels between Manhattan and Queens used by the railroad, started in a conduit housing third-rail cables around 5:40 p.m., fire and transit officials said.</p>
        <p>The tunnel was shut down as firefighters arrived on a special train from Queens to fight it, said Firefighter Robert Calise. But as they did, the smoke drifted west and into the station.</p>
        <p>The station was not evacuated, but from 6:20 to 7 p.m. commuters were not allowed to enter it , said Brian Dolan, an L.I.R.R. spokesman. Service was halted from 6:20 to 6:35, and was limited until 8 p.m., when it returned to normal, with trains using the other tunnels, Mr. Dolan said.</p>
        <p>The damaged tunnel remained closed last night, however, as Amtrak worked to repair cables and tracks, Mr. Dolan said. He urged commuters to listen to the radio for updates. Fire officials said that no one was injured and that they did not know the cause of the fire.</p>
        <p>Tom Oliva, a lawyer who said he had hoped to catch the 6:20 to Port Washington, said that at one point, the smoke ''got so thick I couldn't see the end of the platform.'' The passengers did not panic, though, he said.</p>
        <p>At 7:40, Mr. Oliva was still waiting for his train, and the bouquet of purple irises he clutched was wilting. ''I bought flowers for my wife,'' he said, ''and they're dying.''</p>
