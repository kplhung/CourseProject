        <p>SO far, much of the entertainment action on the Web has come from the dozens and dozens of dot-com start-ups that have struggled to attract audiences by transmitting short pieces of video and animation -- minifilms, cartoons, soap opera installments, sitcoms -- that usually last no longer than a few minutes. It has been a hard slog. Some big names in Hollywood were recruited to create these new entertainments for various sites, and while most of the productions have been quite raw and awkward to view on a computer, a few have been extraordinarily clever.</p>
        <p>Now, however, the thinking seems to be shifting. There is a growing suspicion that streaming vignettes, no matter how clever, are unlikely to ever draw a mass audience away from its television sets.

        <p>SO far, much of the entertainment action on the Web has come from the dozens and dozens of dot-com start-ups that have struggled to attract audiences by transmitting short pieces of video and animation -- minifilms, cartoons, soap opera installments, sitcoms -- that usually last no longer than a few minutes. It has been a hard slog. Some big names in Hollywood were recruited to create these new entertainments for various sites, and while most of the productions have been quite raw and awkward to view on a computer, a few have been extraordinarily clever.</p>
        <p>Now, however, the thinking seems to be shifting. There is a growing suspicion that streaming vignettes, no matter how clever, are unlikely to ever draw a mass audience away from its television sets. If all the Web is doing is creating jerky, inferior versions of the stories that make up movies and TV shows, why should people pay attention?</p>
        <p>''Right now, I am not entertained by anything on the Web,'' said Scott Ross, the president of Digital Domain, one of Hollywood's leading computer-effects houses. ''Nothing. Because it's too constrained by the technology.''</p>
        <p>An inevitable result is that these dot-coms are growing increasingly serious about finding new ways to generate entertainment that is less like television and more geared to the Web. With the help of a series of breakthroughs that are expected to be available in the coming months in software, in hardware and in fresh creative thinking about how to use them, entertainment companies are expected to give increased emphasis to figuring out ways to better exploit the most fundamental power of the Internet -- its interactivity.</p>
        <p>''It's like we've been at the same stage as television was in its early days, when they were basically just making televised versions of radio programs,'' said Fred Angelopoulos, the chief executive of Pulse Entertainment, which develops interactive entertainment for the Web. ''Whenever a new technology comes along, its first inclination is always to make new versions of the previous technology. In early television, they made radio programs. Today, on the Web, the tendency is to make little stories, like movies or television programs.''</p>
        <p>Yes, both TV and the Web involve people watching images on a screen. But the essentially passive nature of watching television is turned topsy-turvy on the Internet. With the Web, the user can talk back. With television, you can change the channel, but you can't change the channel.</p>
        <p>''It's got to be something other than television,'' said David Wertheimer, the president of Wirebreak.com, a Web-entertainment company that has also focused on interactivity. ''Why do things on the Web if it's just like watching a TV show?''</p>
        <p>Now, however, there are many who think that, with the advent of new three-dimensional software and the ubiquity of more powerful home computers and soon-to-be-released game consoles like Sony's Playstation 2, the holy grail of truly interactive entertainment may be within reach.</p>
        <p>''I think that all of these early efforts on the Web were important to help us get to this next step,'' said John Hegeman, a co-founder of Distant Corners, a recently introduced entertainment Web site aimed at young horror and science-fiction fans. ''There is a conditioning process that is necessary with the audience.''</p>
        <p>The earliest efforts at interactive storytelling were on computer games, especially after the CD-ROM format made it possible to include videos and high-quality sound. Most of these were so-called branch stories, where players might move through a castle and come to a corridor with three doors in it, then choose which door to open and move the story in that direction. Instead of one linear story line, there were numerous permutations. But the stories were also inherently limiting; instead of being able to freely explore that virtual castle or interact at will with other characters, the user had only a small series of options, leaving a sense of limitation rather than one of freedom.</p>
        <p>Many of the interactive entertainments on the Web have followed the same multiple-choice format, although some recent examples are more sophisticated. Wirebreak, for instance, is producing a program called ''Wire Breaking Point,'' in which two actors with digital cameras act out a ''Candid Camera''-like situation with an unsuspecting person, with the audience voting on how the person will react.</p>
        <p>Another kind of early nonlinear story was the so-called Easter egg model, in which users worked their way through a virtual environment, searching for clues and pieces of treasure hidden like Easter eggs in imaginary chambers.</p>
        <p>''We're going to see a lot more sophisticated gaming environments, too, with a lot more multiuser games,'' said Mr. Hegeman of Distant Corners. ''And not just the traditional kinds of games, but some that are more like intellectual scavenger hunts.''</p>
        <p>Others are trying to find ways to let Web users interact with filmmakers to shape the stories from the very beginning. ''We are in discussions with one filmmaker who wants to create a series of shorts which would be produced with feedback from consumers,'' said Joseph A. Cantwell, the executive vice president for new media at Bravo Networks in New York. ''Maybe not in real time, but during the production cycle in the creative flow. We like it conceptually and are trying to find a way to make it happen. It's unwieldy, though, very hard to do.''</p>
        <p>OTHERS think that interactivity can best be exploited by empowering users to shape the look and content of what appears on their screens, a kind of supercharged version of personalized home pages.</p>
        <p>Another start-up, Television.com, intends to offer a Web site that will allow people to plug their cable or satellite TV connection into their computer and watch programs over a Web page. ''The idea is to use the interactivity of the Web to give people more power over what they see on the screen, and to connect them to people who are having the same experience,'' said Larry Namer, chairman of Television.com and one othe the founders of the E! Entertainment network. Viewers could adjust the size of the image, have stock quotes and other news appearing on the screen at the same time and have links to chat rooms about whatever program is being watched or to previews of coming programs.</p>
        <p>And many are predicting that there will be less distinction in the future between entertainment-only sites and commercial sites. To be competitive and keep users hooked, information and shopping sites will also have to have a strong interactive entertainment component.</p>
        <p>By the end of the year, a select smattering of computer users will begin to receive odd-looking e-mail messages, the first step in a marketing campaign through which LifeFX hopes to introduce its technology for creating three-dimensional, photorealistic, interactive human ''stand-ins'' on the Web.</p>
        <p>Those who receive LifeFX's e-mail messages -- and then, it is hoped, make new ones and pass them along -- will first wait while their computer downloads the LifeFX media player and then watch as a realistic three-dimensional face appears on the screen, reading and emoting along with the the message. These people will then be able to write their own e-mail messages to friends, messages that will be read aloud to the recipients by a digital actress who is programmed to look angry, happy or distraught at key points in the message.</p>
        <p>This is just the first step, said Lucy Salhany, LifeFX's chief executive. By next year, people will be able to have three-dimensional images of themselves (or of their children) created from regular photographs, which can be turned into talking e-mail messages or home pages and, eventually, become part of fully immersive, interactive environments. E-commerce sites will be able to employ a cybersales staff.</p>
        <p>''That's always been the dream, to be able to talk to a computer screen and have it talk back,'' said Paul Charette, a director of research and development for LifeFX.</p>
        <p>And once people have 3-D images of themselves loaded into their computer, they will even be able to try on clothes, change their hairstyles and watch their cyberselves explore virtual worlds and interact with other 3-D humans and creatures.</p>
        <p>The crucial term, besides interactivity, is immersive. Many think that the increasing viability of three-dimension computer animation and of photorealistic effects, along with related developments in interactive sound and in haptics -- in which tension is added to the mouse, joystick or game pad to give the illusion that images on the screen have weight and force -- will slowly create Internet entertainment experiences that drag the user into the virtual world.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is abandoning tried-and-true storytelling formats, of course, though even those sites are devising ways to inject a sense of interactivity into the experience.</p>
        <p>Stan Lee, the co-creator of comic book classics like ''The Amazing Spider-Man,'' ''The Incredible Hulk'' and ''X-Men,'' has morphed into Stan Lee Media, a dot-com company in California that is developing animated features for the Web. ''The Seventh Portal'' is one such early effort. In it, players in a multiuser gaming environment are sucked into a cyberspace world where they must save us all from an evil force.</p>
        <p>''In our Webisodes, we don't have the user actually determining what our characters do,'' Mr. Lee said. ''We want them to watch our story.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Lee said that his company had opted to exploit the Web's interactivity with some of the ancillary components that surround his stories, like chat rooms and minigames that users can play while waiting for the Webisodes to download.</p>
        <p>In general, though, most people in the industry expect a vigorous expansion in coming months in the interactive nature of the online entertainment experience, in terms of breaking the boundaries of linear storytelling and in enabling users to control the shape and scope of what they see.</p>
        <p>''I think you are going to find original content that is truly unique to the Internet prevalent throughout the online experience before the end of the year,'' said Mr. Hegeman of Distant Corners.</p>
        <p>Of course, that does not mean that there will not be bumps in the road, as the shuttering of Pop.com, the Internet partnership between Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg of DreamWorks and Ron Howard and Brian Grazer of Imagine Entertainment, showed earlier this month.</p>
        <p>''There will be a lot of failed attempts,'' said Mr. Hegeman of Distant Corners. ''Remember, the first person who tried to build a plane wasn't the Wright Brothers.''</p>
