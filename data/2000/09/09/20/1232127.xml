        <p>When the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges collapsed last week, the participants were left to confront an odd reality: those markets, it turned out, could not beat the market.</p>
        <p>Essentially, the London-Frankfurt deal had been a hurried attempt to construct a ''merger of equals'' between unequal partners, riven by national and cultural differences, regulatory distinctions and concerns over technology and back-office clearing and settlement procedures. And, when it came to making a final decision on the merger -- it was challenged by a rival bid and by opposition from retail traders and brokers -- the deal dissolved, bringing down with it the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, who resigned on Friday.</p>
        <p>But, even as Europe's traditional exchanges maneuver for position in a complex consolidation, some bankers and analysts maintain that the market has already moved on, seeking simpler, cheaper trading from more nimble Internet-based trading systems, leaving the Continent's equities markets facing a lengthy and uneven odyssey in pursuit of the vision of a pan-European market.</p>
        <p>''This is just the opening shot in a process that is going to be very messy because you have all kind of forces coming into play,'' said a senior British banker. ''We have opened Pandora's box.''</p>
        <p>Some stock-trading experts have even come to question the basic premise that mergers like the proposed fusion of the London-Frankfurt bourses are workable.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe merger is the way out, or whether it even makes any sense,'' said Narayan Naik, a professor of finance at the London Business School.</p>
        <p>Rather, as Europe's traditional exchanges weigh possible combinations, some traders have begun to turn to alternatives like Tradepoint Financial Networks P.L.C., an electronic market with a portfolio of pan-European blue-chip stocks that is aiming to secure 20 percent of Europe's cross-border equities trading by late 2002. And it is the challenge from such trading organizations  known as electronic communications networks, or E.C.N.'s, that will increasingly put pressure on traditional exchanges to devise their own pan-European solutions.</p>
        <p>''The future is E.C.N.'s,'' Professor Naik said.</p>
        <p>The collapse of the London-Frankfurt deal was accelerated when OM Gruppen A.B., operator of the Stockholm exchange, made a hostile bid for the 200-year-old London market. But even before then, the fault lines in the London-Frankfurt merger, particularly in London, had been clear. Retail brokerage firms feared it would hurt them. Regulators in Britain and Germany raised alarms about the integrity of the merged markets, which would have traded European blue chips in London and high-growth stocks in Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>The all-stock merger bore little resemblance to a conventional merger where the interests of shareholders presumably are the most important. ''The deal was done in smoke-filled rooms behind closed doors,'' the British banker said.</p>
        <p>The question, though, is whether any future consolidation effort in Europe will be stymied by the same combination of national and vested interests and other hurdles. Apart from fighting OM Gruppen's hostile bid, the London exchange, which has been completely electronic since 1986, is also a potential takeover candidate for other predators -- including the parent of its former merger partner, the Frankfurt exchange,  Deutsche Borse in combination with the Milan and Madrid exchanges, and by a combination of the Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels bourses called Euronext.</p>
        <p>That has provided an opening for Tradepoint and other E.C.N.'s. ''Rather than having 200 years of history, we created our E.C.N. from a clean sheet of paper,'' said Steve Wilson, Tradepoint's director of business development. ''We asked: What does the market want? And the market said: We want a cheap and efficient way to trade, clear and settle equities in Europe across borders, and that's what we do.''</p>
        <p>''While the traditional exchanges are looking at new business models, we are able to get one with implementing our business plan,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That includes a deal, to be carried out next year, for the SWX Swiss Exchange to take a 38 percent equity stake in Tradepoint in a venture to trade Swiss blue-chip equities on Tradepoint, giving it 10 percent of cross-border European trading volumes, Mr. Wilson said. The exchange plans to change its name to virt-X.</p>
        <p>Tradepoint, like other E.C.N.'s, has been established with backing from the same big American and European banks that dominate trading on the London exchange and ultimately call the shots for many smaller traders. The backers of Tradepoint, who control 54 percent of its stock, include Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Deutsche Bank and J. P. Morgan. But their influence is dependent on their own prospects for growth.</p>
        <p>And, while E.C.N.'s are seen as a challenge to formal exchanges, they are unlikely to displace the big exchanges either in some regulatory functions or as the prime source of liquidity that sets prices.</p>
        <p>''It's possible that many of the major current exchanges will be supplanted by much more nimble, lower-cost Internet trading systems,'' said Ruben Lee, director of the Oxford Finance Group, a consulting firm. ''However, the need to regulate markets means that these new systems will have to adopt similar regulatory functions and so will be called exchanges. It's not that exchanges will go away, but will morph into something different.''</p>
