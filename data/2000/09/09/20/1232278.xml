        <p>DAVIS-Sophie. American Friends of The Hebrew University and The Hebrew University of Jerusalem mourn the passing of Sophie Davis. Sophie and her husband Leonard have been long time supporters and Benefactors of The Hebrew University as well as many secular and Jewish causes in Florida and New York. Many programs at the University have benefited from their generosity, most notably the Leonard Davis Institute for International Relations and the Sanford F. Kuvin Center for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases. Their wise counsel and dedicated support have provided the foundation for AFHU activities in Palm Beach, Fl. We extend our deepest condolences to her husband Leonard, her sons Alan and Michael, her four grandchildren, and the entire family. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Professor Menachem Magidor, President Professor Menahem Ben-Sasson, Rector Yigal Arnon, Chairman of the Board of Governors American Friends of The Hebrew University Ira Lee Sorkin, President Keith L. Sachs, Chairman of the Board Barbara A. Mandel, Honorary President Adam B. Kahan, Executive Vice President</p>

Their generosity has extended through the twenty years of the Hall's existence with an annual gift that has been critical to the mission and sustained life of Aaron Davis Hall, Harlem's Principal Center for the Performing Arts. We offer our sincere condolences on her passing to her husband and partner Leonard, her sons Alan and Michael, their families, and her friend and colleague Marilyn Hoadley.</p>

Klein, Exec. V.P.</p>
