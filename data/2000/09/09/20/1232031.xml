        <p>LAUREL WELLS, a co-founder and the marketing director of Gurl.com, an Internet magazine for teenagers, is a study in bohemian chic.</p>
        <p>Dressed in a raspberry silk shirt from India, her hair a nimbus of coppery curls, she looks like an anti-geek, not at all the type you would expect to be besotted with gadgetry.</p>
        <p>But besotted she is. Like many of her colleagues in the Internet world, Ms. Wells is obsessed with electronic gizmos as gorgeous and stylish as they are smart. The rarer and more novel the gadget, the more fanciful and streamlined in design, the more she must have it -- or better yet, wear it.</p>
        <p>Her current fixation: a clear blue plastic Bic-like cigarette lighter that a colleague brought back from Japan. It flames when you flick it -- and spouts a Japanese phrase. ''I'm always asking my friends to bring one back the next time they're in Tokyo,'' Ms. Wells said longingly.</p>
        <p>She and her counterparts at Internet offices everywhere share a lust for the last word in tech -- objects so racy, clever and compact that they double as fashion statements. The most desirable gadgets are small and easy to use, said Christine Harmel, the chief executive of Interactive Resources, a company in Manhattan that matches Web site developers with clients.</p>
        <p>But their status spikes if they are sleek enough to tote or to wear.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harmel plans to invest in a Sony NW-E3 Network Walkman. ''You can interchange the music, and it's also downloadable,'' she said. But best of all, she added, ''it's the size of a candy bar,'' something she can stash in her purse and pop out when she needs to make an impression.</p>
        <p>In the democratic, all-casual-all-the-time Internet workplaces, the urge to stand out may surface with a vengeance, finding an outlet in what's known as ''cool stuff.''</p>
        <p>Manufacturers have responded to the craving for sleek, wearable or totable designs with offerings like the Nokia 8860, a cell phone so compact and shiny it might be mistaken for a cigarette lighter. Costing from $500 to $800, it also functions as a conversation piece, which is a major part of its appeal.</p>
        <p>The new Nokia 8200 series takes the fashion formula even further. The three-ounce 8210 phone, introduced at the Kenzo show in Paris last fall, has six interchangeable faceplates. Such style-driven innovations have pumped the company's sales and fattened profits; Nokia says that since introducing its sleeker, smaller models, sales have jumped to 78.5 million phones in 1999 from 40 million in 1998.</p>
        <p>Sony has also leaped on the trend of  wearable gadgetry.</p>
        <p>This year the company introduced its newest MP3 player, a next-generation Walkman that is actually a necklace. It downloads music from the Net without wires and can be fitted, at the user's whim, with a tiny mobile phone among its digital baubles.</p>
        <p>So hot is wearable tech that it is about to take to the runways in an even bigger way. At the Internet World Conference in New York, one of the industry's biggest events, which will take place Oct. 23-27, a reprise of last year's highly popular fashion show will be staged.</p>
        <p>Fashionmakers have also heeded electronics' siren call. In Europe, the Levi Strauss Company and Philips Technology have collaborated on the ICD Plus collection, which includes a jacket with a built-in phone and an interactive MP3 player.</p>
        <p>Of course, if looks were everything, the new Claudia Schiffer-designed aqua Palm  hand-held device would be geek chic's dernier cri. It's not. ''I thought it was kind of silly and pointless,'' Ms. Harmel said. ''Basically it's a nice color.''</p>
        <p>In many companies, owning a gadget that combines great looks and brains actually signals a person's place in the office pecking order.</p>
        <p>The smarter the pager, cell phone or laptop, the higher it rates in the hierarchy of cool.</p>
        <p>Jason McCabe Calacanis, the founder of the Silicon Alley Reporter, a monthly magazine, favors devices that allow him to respond, wherever he may be, to some 200 phone calls and 400 e-mail messages a day. ''I can't be out of contact,'' he confided.  ''There are three things on my belt at all times: a StarTac cell phone, a Motorola GSM and a Blackberry pager.'' The last, a hybrid between a pager and a personal digital assistant, allows people on the move to receive long e-mail messages and can act as a Web browser.</p>
        <p>Wearing such a bandolier's burden of gadgets sends a powerful signal about the wearer's status in the company.</p>
        <p>The most coveted gadget in the office of Bruce Rayvid, the marketing director of Boo.com, an Internet fashion marketer, is a wireless headset that creates the illusion of solitude. ''I sit in a bullpen with the chairman and chief technical officer,'' Mr. Rayvid said. ''None of us have our own office, so the big thing here is a cordless XLT from Hello Direct. It's a status symbol,'' he added, ''not just because few of us have one, but because when you wear one you can actually walk around the room and have a private conversation.''</p>
        <p>At the office, Anthony Lappe, the vice president for news at Polyverse, a youth-market Internet media company, wears a relatively discreet earpiece he bought at Staples. Wee as it is, it makes him seem a titan, with a personal line to some unseen high command.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lappe keeps his radar trained on what he and his colleagues call ''the next big thing.'' ''All of us have Verizon Web-enabled StarTac,'' he gloated. ''The next thing is getting text messages on a wireless network that delivers e-mail over the phone.'' His company is experimenting with UPOC.com, which provides services to wireless Net users. So advanced is the network, Mr. Lappe pointed out, that it hasn't been offered to the public.</p>
        <p>MARK HURST, the president of Creative Good, a Web site consulting company in Manhattan, totes his Apple Powerbook in his ''geek pack,'' a multipocket backpack he has issued to everyone in his company. ''At client meetings, we all unzip our geek packs, pull out our Powerbooks and flip them open at the same time,'' he said. ''The reaction from clients is, 'Whoa!' Those Powerbooks glow. Visually, they are impressive machines.''</p>
        <p>To Mr. Calacanis of the Silicon Alley Reporter, there are few things sexier than his StarTac or his slender and luminous Palm. Recently though, he stopped using it. ''I actually got an assistant,'' he confided. ''A human assistant! Now that is the ultimate status symbol.''</p>
