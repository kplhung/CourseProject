        <p>Joel I. Klein, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division and chief architect of the government's case against the Microsoft Corporation, announced today that he would be stepping down at the end of next week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein's departure will come within days of the Supreme Court's decision whether to review the order proposed by the government to break up Microsoft after a court's findings that the company bullied competitors, stifled innovation and repeatedly violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.</p>
        <p>Since he will be succeeded by A. Douglas Melamed, his chief lieutenant and right-hand man in the Microsoft matter and other major pending cases, officials said the resignation would have no impact on the direction of the antitrust division. Mr. Klein's departure had been widely expected as the Clinton administration entered its final months.</p>
        <p>While administration officials said today that Mr. Klein, 53, could command a top position should Vice President Al Gore become president, Mr. Klein suggested that it was time to leave government, after nearly eight years as an official in the Clinton administration. He had joined the administration in 1993 a few months after Mr. Clinton came to Washington, replacing Vincent W. Foster Jr. as deputy White House counsel after Mr. Foster committed suicide.</p>
        <p>Appearing relaxed in an open-collar shirt and blue blazer, Mr. Klein said today in an interview in his office that he had no idea where he would land next, other than that he was ''exploring options throughout the private sector.''</p>
        <p>''This is the chance of a lifetime, to spend time and talk to a lot of people about what to do next,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein leaves the Justice Department with a formidable track record. While less aggressive than some earlier antitrust chiefs -- particularly those during the 1960's and earlier in the century -- he challenged some of the nation's biggest businesses, forcing corporate captains to take notice of Washington when contemplating mergers, joint ventures, business expansions and pricing policies.</p>
        <p>During his tenure, the Justice Department announced a number of record-breaking antitrust fines, recouping nearly $2 billion in total, an unparalleled sum for one of the department's smaller divisions. (The annual budget of the division is about $100 million.)</p>
        <p>Among the proposed mergers or joint ventures that were abandoned in the face of challenges by Mr. Klein were Lockheed Martin-Northrop Grumman, WorldCom-Sprint, and Northwest-Continental. The division also has pending a number of important civil cases, including a monopoly maintenance suit against American Airlines and an anti-competition case against Visa and MasterCard.</p>
        <p>In the criminal arena, the department broke up a major global vitamins cartel and began an investigation of Sotheby's and Christie's.</p>
