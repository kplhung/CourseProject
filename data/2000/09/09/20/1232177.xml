        <p>MANY urban teachers' unions have negotiated the right for senior members to pick the schools where they teach. Some have gone further. In Los Angeles, teachers can even choose which classes to teach. And in Boston, principals cannot rehire promising first-year teachers if senior instructors want the novices' jobs.</p>
        <p>School boards have been aiming to end these practices, leading to conflicts with unions. Boston teachers are now refusing extra duties to protest district proposals. The Philadelphia union has taken a strike vote, partly over a seniority dispute.</p>
        <p>It is clear that union-negotiated transfer rights can conflict with good educational management. Rigid rules for filling vacancies can harm principals' efforts to meld teachers into effective teams. But seniority is also becoming something of a scapegoat.</p>
        <p>Without flexible teacher pay policies and better principal selection, abolishing seniority will not help.</p>
        <p>New York and other cities often place new teachers in the poorest and lowest-scoring schools, which senior teachers can avoid. These sites have openings because teachers transfer out of them, selecting schools deemed more desirable, with children who are easier to teach.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles used to spend less on schools in poorer neighborhoods because many teachers in them, new to the job, had lower pay. But a court order has forced schools with above-average spending to fill openings with newer hires.</p>
        <p>In August, the New York State Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills, sued to force New York City to place certified teachers, regardless of their wishes, at low-scoring sites. Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy replied that there were too few certified teachers to go around, and that he could not force on them placements they did not want.</p>
        <p>In a compromise this year, Mr. Levy hired new certified teachers for low-scoring elementary schools, before other schools were allowed to offer them jobs. The dispute will arise again in 2001.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy was correct. It is foolish to ignore senior teachers' preferences. If assigned involuntarily, they may move to suburban districts or leave teaching.</p>
        <p>Some racially biased teachers may think good schools are those with few minority pupils. Such teachers should be urged to use seniority rights to transfer; if they stay, they could harm children for whom they have low expectations.</p>
        <p>But teachers may also want to work closer to home, or seek easier jobs with pupils more ready to learn. As teachers age, desires for lighter burdens are normal. These are good reasons to honor seniority.</p>
        <p>There is a better way to move good teachers to difficult schools. Market forces suggest raising salaries at sites that are hard to staff. Then, experienced teachers will want to move into difficult schools, not out of them. But big boosts are needed. Rudy Crew, the former chancellor of New York City schools, offered a 15 percent bonus to volunteers for the lowest-scoring schools, but still could not fill the jobs. Board officials now guess it would take about a $20,000 differential to attract high-quality teachers to the most difficult places.</p>
        <p>Pay differentials can also solve science, bilingual and special-education shortages. Higher pay would lure mathematicians to teaching and encourage more undergraduates to major in math.</p>
        <p>Unions usually resist this idea, typically accepting only token increments for bilingual teachers or those in poor neighborhoods. Union leaders recall old fights to win single salary schedules in systems that paid men more than women and whites more than blacks. But this history should not preclude sensible differentials today.</p>
        <p>Salary and seniority reform alone will not staff the most difficult  schools. A surprise discovery in the Los Angeles litigation was the low  turnover in some sites in low-income neighborhoods, while it was high in some seemingly desirable schools. The same is true in New York.</p>
        <p>The most challenging schools that still retain teachers have principals with clear goals who establish order and inspire teachers to accept difficult challenges. When good teachers bail out, it may indicate a lack of leadership.</p>
        <p>Choosing principals who can build high-performing teams is the most important task of district leaders. Then, with pay differentials for difficult schools in place, principals, perhaps in consultation with other staff members, should be able to select compatible teachers without seniority as a deciding factor.</p>
        <p>Unions typically say experienced teachers can work anywhere. But just as some principals are more effective, teachers also vary.</p>
        <p>A few districts have changed the way seniority works. In St. Paul, senior teachers once claimed openings, but now principals can reject applicants who do not seem to fit. Seattle, Columbus and Milwaukee have made similar changes.</p>
        <p>To get the best teachers for difficult schools, limiting seniority is only a partial solution. Also needed are pay differentials when volunteers are scarce and principals who make good teachers want to stay.</p>
