In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to Colgate University or the Photography Department of the Santa Barbara Museum of Art or the Photography Department of the Museum of Modern Art.</p>
        <p>LITTLE-William Brian. We mourn the untimely passing of Brian Little, a favorite and honored client who became an esteemed friend. His warmth and gentleman's manner were ever a joy and his generosity of spirit such that he repaid loyalty and friendship a thousand fold. We extend our deepest condolences to Judy and his family at this time of great saddness. The Trunzo Family</p>
        <p>LITTLE-Wm. Brian. The employees and Board of Directors of ScreamingMedia mourn the death of our friend and colleague, Brian Little. Brian's wise advice, unwavering support, and tremendous warmth will be greatly missed. To his wife, Judy, and his children, Gregg and Jackie, we extend our deepest condolences.</p>
        <p>LITTLE-Wm. Brian. Wm. Brian Little first came to know Department 56, Inc in 1992. He took a keen interest in our giftware and collectibles business, and many of us met him at our home offices in Minneapolis or at trade shows in New York. He was amiable, straight-forward, practical-minded, and a pillar of excellence. Brian was a loyal supporter of Department 56 and its people and we will miss him greatly. The Employees and Board of Directors of Department 56, Inc.</p>
        <p>LITTLE-Wm Brian. The Board of Directors, Musicians, and Supporters of the Bridgehampton Chamber Music Festival sadly mourn the loss of our colleague, benefactor, and dear friend Brian. We send our love and heartfelt sympathy to Judy and the family. Kenneth S. Davidson, Chairman Marya Martin, Artistic Director Elizabeth Ellis Hurwitt, Exec. Dir.</p>
