        <p>Mike Bailey, a professional, waded into a pool, grabbed an eight-foot alligator by the tail and started tugging it back and forth like a wet mop as tourists watched from behind a steel fence at the Seminole Okalee Indian Village and Museum.</p>
        <p>''Wait,'' screamed 3-year-old Ryan Keats. ''You can't!''</p>
        <p>But for $12 an hour, Mr. Bailey does.</p>
        <p>He reached into the water, wrapped his arms around the squirming, hissing, 220-pound alligator and carried it to a spit of sand.</p>
        <p>''Is he gonna bite?'' Ryan screamed.</p>
        <p>''He's gonna try,'' grunted Mr. Bailey, straining to pin the alligator to the sand.</p>
        <p>The alligator opened its jaws to show two U-shaped rows of flesh-rending teeth, 40 on the top, 40 on the bottom.</p>
        <p>There are, said officials of the Seminole Nation, immediate openings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey grabbed the alligator's open jaws in his hands.</p>
        <p>Health insurance, Seminole officials pointed out, is available.</p>
        <p>But despite decent pay and benefits, ''we just don't have enough alligator wrestlers,'' said Alexandra Frank, operations manager at Seminole Okalee Village, a small museum and tourist stop between Miami and Fort Lauderdale on the Seminole Reservation.</p>
        <p>For decades, Seminoles here have entertained tourists -- and relieved them of their vacation dollars -- by wrestling alligators. But now, Seminoles said, they must attract people like Mr. Bailey because there is a shortage of young people in the tribe who want to go into the line of work, preferring college, e-commerce, casinos and, well, anything else.</p>
        <p>So, tribe officials are trying to recruit alligator wrestlers, and ''just because someone's not a Seminole, doesn't mean we'll look down on them,'' Ms. Frank said.</p>
        <p>The tribe even advertised in The Sun-Sentinel newspaper in Fort Lauderdale: ''WANTED: Alligator wrestlers. Must be brave and a risk taker. Males and females O.K. No experience needed.''</p>
        <p>So far, only a few people have applied.</p>
        <p>''Ain't very many of them going to have a chance of getting a job,'' said Mr. Bailey, a powerfully built 22-year-old who is not a Seminole but does have a stepfather who is part Choctaw. ''Most of them just weren't any good.''</p>
        <p>And, said Mr. Bailey, the village's head alligator wrestler, there is really no such thing as a bad alligator wrestler.</p>
        <p>''They'll kill you in a second,'' he said, ''or if you're lucky, they'll just tear your fingers off.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, a Seminole chief, James Billie, lost a finger while wrestling an alligator in a tourist stop in the Everglades, as about 100 tourists looked on.</p>
        <p>''More and more, Seminoles pursue other careers,'' Ms. Frank said. ''They're being told again and again to go pursue a college education. It would be nice to keep it a tradition, but it's their choice.''</p>
        <p>One applicant was Lance Holmquist, 39, who owns a charter boat company in Key Largo, Fla.</p>
        <p>''They never really asked us if we were qualified for the job,'' said Mr. Holmquist, who had an interview recently along with a few others. ''Their only big concern was if we had any kind of heart problems.''</p>
        <p>He said he was not doing it for the money, but the adventure.</p>
        <p>''Basically, I like to take risks,'' he said. ''I like to chase hurricanes and ride fierce waves. I like to ride my motorcycle in heavy downpours. I love to go spearfishing, being surrounded by sharks in the water.</p>
        <p>''I hope they hire me.''</p>
        <p>Seminole officials said his application was still being considered.</p>
        <p>''I'm still waiting for the call back,'' Mr. Holmquist said.</p>
        <p>Alligator wrestlers put on four shows a day at the Okalee Village, and every move, they said, is carefully thought out.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bailey grabbed the alligator's tail and began to swing the gator back and forth in the water, he was not trying to make it mad, but to make it tired, so that it could be more safely handled.</p>
        <p>It is all for show, but it was not always so.</p>
        <p>Alligator wrestling runs deep in Seminole history, long before the tourists came. Once, the Seminoles  captured the alligators and kept them as a ready source of food, much the same way sailors once stowed live turtles in ship holds on long journeys.</p>
        <p>''You can't domesticate them,'' said Michael Osceola, 26, who is the only Seminole who wrestles alligators at the Okalee Village. ''They don't know you, and they'll definitely never love you. They're dangerous animals. Anything they eat, they swallow whole. They don't know us and they'll never get used to us. They don't think like that. They have a brain the size of a sweet pea.''</p>
        <p>He has been drawn to alligator wrestling all his life.</p>
        <p>''It's part of my culture,'' said Mr. Osceola, as he watched Mr. Bailey wrestle an alligator named Scratch. ''It's not something you can read out of a book and learn how to do. I'm still learning. I train every other day.</p>
        <p>''A lot of Seminole Indians choose not to do what I'm doing,'' he said. ''They're going to college. They're choosing other careers. They're going off to better themselves. I also thought that. I went off to college and got my degree in electronics. But this is what I love, what I'm hungry for.''</p>
        <p>For decades, tourists passing through South Florida have paid -- the going rate now is $5 -- to watch the spectacle.</p>
        <p>Animal rights activists have complained that the wrestlers abuse the alligators during the shows, which end with the wrestler sitting on the animal's back, gripping its snout.</p>
        <p>But the alligators are difficult to hurt. ''I don't believe there's any physical harm done,'' at least to the alligator, said Kent Vliet, an alligator biologist at the University of Florida. ''But the animals definitely don't like it. They try to turn and run. I think they'd prefer to be left alone.''</p>
        <p>Back in the alligator pit, Mr. Bailey straddled Scratch's back as Ryan tried to climb his father's leg in the audience, begging to be picked up.</p>
        <p>''Don't worry,'' said his father, Steve Keats. ''I'll protect you.''</p>
        <p>Most people have no idea of how dangerous an alligator is, Mr. Osceola said. They move faster across dry land than a person can, and if they attack in the water, they are even more deadly.</p>
        <p>He once wrestled three of them in one day. ''I knew I was alive,'' he said, when it was all over and he was still intact. ''I was still alive.''</p>
        <p>Applications are still being taken.</p>
