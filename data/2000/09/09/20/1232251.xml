        <p>Lance Armstrong said today that he was largely recovered from a cracked neck vertebra he sustained when he was hit by a car three weeks ago while cycling in Nice, France, and would race next week in the 148.4-mile Olympic road race and 29-mile individual time trial.</p>
        <p>''The neck is still a slight problem,'' he said. ''It's a little stiff, but it's 90 percent, which is enough.'' He added: ''It's not a risky fracture. I'm not at risk by riding with it.'' He said the injury would affect his preparation for the road race more than for the time trial.</p>

        <p>Lance Armstrong said today that he was largely recovered from a cracked neck vertebra he sustained when he was hit by a car three weeks ago while cycling in Nice, France, and would race next week in the 148.4-mile Olympic road race and 29-mile individual time trial.</p>
        <p>''The neck is still a slight problem,'' he said. ''It's a little stiff, but it's 90 percent, which is enough.'' He added: ''It's not a risky fracture. I'm not at risk by riding with it.'' He said the injury would affect his preparation for the road race more than for the time trial.</p>
        <p>He said he was reassured by his victory last Saturday at the Grand Prix of Nations in France. ''I did a 70-kilometer time trial at 50k per hour,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone in cycling can do that.'' Still, he admitted, ''The scary part is trying to avoid another neck injury.''</p>
        <p>Armstrong is a third-time Olympian, but did not fare especially well in the 1992 and 1996 Summer Games. Now, after winning the Tour de France in 1999 and 2000 and overcoming testicular cancer, he is expected to win -- cracked vertebra or not. ''Barcelona feels like a really long time ago,'' he said. ''I didn't have a lot of experience in the Olympics or in cycling then. In Atlanta, I was very sick, but I didn't know it. To come back here is special. It feels better this time. I didn't feel at home in Barcelona or Atlanta.''</p>
        <p>His status on the Olympic cycling team is such that during a news conference today, no questions were asked of his four teammates for 45 minutes. When one was asked, it was to inquire about what it is like when the news media ask questions of no one but Armstrong.</p>
        <p>Armstrong was irked by questions about the International Olympic Committee's testing to detect the banned performance-boosting drug EPO. While pleased that negative test results will validate cyclists' results, he said: ''Cycling has been criminalized and singled out in this issue. It exists in all sports, not just in cycling.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I'm tired of having to defend the sport. I don't think the problem is as widespread as it was believed to have been. In the end, we will prove to be one of the cleanest sports because of what we've done. Cycling has done more than any sport to combat drugs. I truly believe that.''</p>
