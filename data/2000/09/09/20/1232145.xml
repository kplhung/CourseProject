        <p>George Bell, one of the first executives to leave a traditional media company to seek his fortune on the Internet, said yesterday that he would step down as chief executive of Excite@Home.</p>
        <p>A statement by the company, which operates one of the most frequented Web sites and offers high-speed Internet service through cable television systems, said Mr. Bell would remain its chairman through 2001.</p>
        <p>The shift is the latest of a series of changes in management or strategy at Excite@Home since it was formed in May 1999 through the merger of Excite, one of the first Internet search engines and portals, and At Home, which offers high-speed Internet access through cable systems.</p>
        <p>At first Tom Jermoluk, the chief executive of At Home, had that role in the combined company. Mr. Bell, who had been chief executive at Excite since 1996, became president. In January of this year, Mr. Bell became chief executive, leaving Mr. Jermoluk the role of chairman, a position he held until May, when he left the company.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the company has wrestled to work out a comfortable relationship with AT&amp;T, its largest shareholder, and the other cable companies it works with, many of whom own minority stakes. Late last year, the company proposed splitting into two separately traded divisions, a plan it abandoned when AT&amp;T agreed to increase its ownership stake.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell, a former Times Mirror Company magazine executive, said in a statement that yesterday's move was ''a natural evolution of the executive management team as a company grows,'' adding, ''I look forward to assisting the company in its growth as full-time chairman.''</p>
        <p>William Randolph Hearst III, a partner in Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, the venture capital firm that was instrumental in creating both Excite and At Home, said Mr. Bell had personal reasons for stepping down. He had moved his family to Boston last year and spent two weeks a month at company headquarters in Redwood City, south of San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''George was trying to live in Boston and be C.E.O. of this company,'' Mr. Hearst said. ''That's hard to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hearst added that the board hoped to recruit a new chief with experience running a large company. He noted that with 2,700 employees, Excite@Home is a far different company from the tiny start-up that Mr. Bell joined.</p>
        <p>On the Instinet electronic trading system, Excite@Home dropped after hours yesterday to $15.52 from its regular-session close of $16.19, soon after it said it would search for a replacement for Mr. Bell.</p>
