        <p>THE pinot family of grapes is a large and hospitable one. And like many families, it's also a bit unstable. We all know -- and a lot of us love -- pinot noir, the head of the clan. And a lot of us like the offspring, pinot gris, which in Italy goes by the name pinot grigio. Gris and grigio, in case you were wondering, both mean gray.</p>
        <p>Don't get me started. Pierre Galet, the French ampelographer (from ampelos, Greek for grapevine), cites at least 100 kinds of pinot -- including pinot Beurot, an ancient name for pinot gris; pinotage, a South African grape invented back in the 20's by crossing pinot noir and cinsault; and even pinot chardonnay, a name that went out of fashion when it finally dawned on the experts that chardonnay has nothing to do with the pinot family. And then there are the cousins clinging to the old-fashioned spelling, pineau, that appears most frequently in the Loire Valley.</p>

        <p>THE pinot family of grapes is a large and hospitable one. And like many families, it's also a bit unstable. We all know -- and a lot of us love -- pinot noir, the head of the clan.

        <p>Don't get me started. Pierre Galet, the French ampelographer (from ampelos, Greek for grapevine), cites at least 100 kinds of pinot -- including pinot Beurot, an ancient name for pinot gris; pinotage, a South African grape invented back in the 20's by crossing pinot noir and cinsault; and even pinot chardonnay, a name that went out of fashion when it finally dawned on the experts that chardonnay has nothing to do with the pinot family. And then there are the cousins clinging to the old-fashioned spelling, pineau, that appears most frequently in the Loire Valley.</p>
        <p>No, I want to talk about pinot blanc. It just may be the grape, and the wine, you've been looking for if you've ever wondered if there is life after chardonnay. Like pinot gris, which is also a white wine, pinot blanc is a mutation of pinot noir -- I told you pinots were unstable -- that first appeared in Burgundy vineyards in the last century. It looks like chardonnay, but produces a different style of wine: full-bodied but with little of the floweriness and pungent bouquet common to the better-known white grape. Even when aged in oak, pinot blanc gives an impression of leanness and restraint not found in chardonnay.</p>
        <p>There is very little pinot blanc in Burgundy anymore; but there is plenty of it in Alsace, where it is sometimes called klevner. It's not as subtle and elegant as Alsatian riesling or as aggressively flowery as Alsatian gewurztraminer. Nor is it as distinguished as the local pinot gris. Still, when matched with simple, hearty foods, it makes a better and certainly more reasonably priced companion than any of them.</p>
        <p>Pinot blanc is produced in impressive quantities in Central and Eastern Europe, and is particularly popular in Austria, where it is known as weissburgunder. Austrian wines are enjoying a certain vogue these days, here in New York anyway, but there doesn't seem to be much weissburgunder around. Perhaps the importers are too busy unloading that old Viennese workhorse gruner veltliner at $35 or more a bottle.</p>
        <p>There is some terrific pinot blanc made in this country, but the grape has had a difficult time of it on our shores. For years, California growers mistakenly cultivated vines of the melon grape thinking they were pinot blanc. It wasn't their fault: the University of California at Davis, which grew the original rootstock, somehow misidentified the two plants. Melon, also known as melon de Bourgogne, is found mostly in the Loire-Atlantique, where it is made into muscadet.</p>
        <p>Our old friend Pierre Galet discovered the mistake in 1980, and the university owned up to the error in 1984. Soon thereafter, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms told the winemakers, ''Look, you've got to stop calling this stuff pinot blanc.'' After the mixup became known, a few California wineries opted to continue making their wine in the same way but labeling it as melon, at least until they could pull out or graft over the impostors and plant certified pinot blanc. Apparently, telling the difference between the two is not easy, and some vintners say that melon is probably still growing and being used in some pinot blanc.</p>
        <p>There are those who claim it really doesn't make that much difference. Especially when both the melon and the true pinot blanc are made the way good chardonnay is made -- with barrel fermentation, oak aging, that sort of thing. These coddled pinot blancs are much prized by connoisseurs, but the ordinary wine fan might very well misidentify them as chardonnays.</p>
        <p>The best bargains are some of the Alsatian wines from producers like Schlumberger, Albrecht, Hugel, Marc Kreydenweiss, Domaine Ostertag, Trimbach and Domaine Weinbach. I particularly liked a Schlumberger '98 at about $7.50. Yes, $7.50. Also a Marcel Deiss Bergheim pinot blanc for about $15.</p>
        <p>Among the California producers, Chalone Vineyards, in Monterey County, makes a pinot blanc that has always been a favorite of mine. Chalone's Reserve pinot blanc exhibits the way Old World tradition blends with the latest technology. The wine is made from whole-cluster grapes that are pressed, not crushed in the usual manner, then aged in French oak. It's a chardonnay competitor for the most elegant dinner table.</p>
        <p>One of the best American sources of good pinot blanc is the legendary Bien Nacido Vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley in Santa Barbara County, north of Los Angeles. One of the finest Bien Nacido pinot blancs comes from Jim Clendenin at Au Bon Climat; another is made by Jedidiah Steele at Steele Wines in Lake County, and yet another comes from Benziger Winery and Vineyards in Sonoma County. California pinot blancs range in price from about $30 for the Chalone down to about $20 for the Benziger.</p>
        <p>Oregon winemakers who have labored long to put their pinot gris forward as a serious white wine have also produced some delectable pinot blancs, most in the $15 range. Erath Vineyards, Bethel Heights and Amity Vineyards are a few in the Willamette Valley. Given the so-so quality of much Oregon chardonnay, it's a pity that more of its vintners don't turn to pinot blanc. But chardonnay is a difficult habit to break.</p>
