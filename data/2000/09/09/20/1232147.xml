        <p>The University of Chicago's newest classroom building seems like a riddle unto itself.</p>
        <p>It is not actually new; it originally opened in 1885. It features not gargoyles and spires, as the university's neo-Gothic campus does, but gold-plated carvings and hand-painted tiles. And it is not anywhere near Chicago. In fact, it sits directly across the street from the offices of the current president of Singapore.</p>
        <p>But sure enough, some 84 students filed into the building -- a former plantation house owned by a Chinese spice merchant who lived in Singapore -- this week to start a two-year M.B.A program that is part of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. The students, mostly executives in their 30's, represent the new campus's first class, and they personify the expansionist dreams of the best-known American business schools.</p>
        <p>Imitating the companies they study, some of the business schools are spending millions of dollars to set up satellite operations around the globe. The schools' rationale for expansion mimics the goals of international companies as well: they hope to find new sources of revenue, establish a brand name in far-away places and learn lessons about how other markets function.</p>
        <p>Chicago's Singapore building is modeled after one in Barcelona that the school built in the 1990's. Last month, Duke began offering classes in Frankfurt and will open a campus there in January. The Harvard Business School has set up research centers in Hong Kong and Buenos Aires and plans to add another in Europe. Northwestern and the University of Pennsylvania are collaborating with McKinsey &amp; Company, the consulting firm, to create the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad next year.</p>
        <p>Some of Europe's top schools have undertaken similar initiatives. The London Business School and Columbia are accepting applications for the first class of an M.B.A. program they will jointly run. Meanwhile, not far from Chicago's Singapore campus, Insead, a 40-year-old business school based in Fontainebleau, France, opened its own M.B.A. program at the start of 2000.</p>
        <p>''If you're going to be a major business school,'' said Gary D. Eppen, a deputy dean at Chicago who oversees the Singapore program, ''we think it's important that you be represented in the major economic cities of the world.''</p>
        <p>Much of the activity is in Asia, where there is no internationally known M.B.A. program but where thousands of students want the degree. ''There's going to be a great talent pool to tap,'' said Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who sits on the advisory board of the Indian School of Business along with the top executives of DaimlerChrysler, GE Capital, Royal Dutch/Shell and other large companies.</p>
        <p>''These economies are changing rapidly, and we all need business leaders who understand the dynamics of technology-driven global marketplaces within the context of their own business realties,'' Mr. Paulson said.</p>
        <p>For the universities, the new campuses also represent one of the most elaborate experiments yet undertaken in so-called distance learning -- the use of the Internet to teach classes. The new M.B.A. programs are something of a middle ground between traditional on-campus courses of study, which require students to live near one another and their professors, and the less expensive online-only degrees now being offered by for-profit schools like Jones International University.</p>
        <p>Instead, at most of the foreign outposts, students spend a week or two studying with professors who have flown in from the home campus to teach them. They then take about a month off from classes, return to their jobs and do homework at night and over the weekend. They use e-mail to bounce ideas off one another and to pose questions to teachers living thousands of miles away.</p>
        <p>In essence, the schools are betting that there is a substantial number of managers in other countries who are willing to pay a large premium to receive a prestigious American degree, rather than attending a local school that awards M.B.A.'s.</p>
        <p>Jeanette Wong is a typical customer. A native of Singapore who has worked for J. P. Morgan the last 14 years, she runs its office there and helps manage its foreign exchange, bond and other markets-oriented businesses. But Ms. Wong still thought she needed the kind of detailed training that rarely comes on the job.</p>
        <p>''The world is changing so fast,'' she said. ''I'm looking for fresh insights.''</p>
        <p>Given her experience, she was not sure she would learn enough at any of Singapore's local M.B.A. programs to justify the time it would take to earn the degree. Traveling to Hong Kong or another city for a part-time program was out of the question, she added, because she and her husband have 10-  and 12-year-old sons.</p>
        <p>So Ms. Wong applied to the first class of Chicago's new program -- largely because of the school's reputation for quantitative rigor, she said -- and is paying out of her own pocket $65,000 for the two-year program. The tuition is more than twice what another program in Singapore would have cost, she said.</p>
        <p>Yet in contrast to students in those other programs, Ms. Wong will have only limited access to her teachers. Once every six weeks, two Chicago professors will fly to Singapore to teach five days of intensive classes in marketing or finance and then return to the United States.</p>
        <p>That schedule, which is similar to Chicago's in Barcelona and Duke's in Frankfurt, contains potential problems for both the students and faculty members. The students will have much less of an opportunity to have impromptu discussions with their teachers -- and each other -- than they would at a full-time program. Schools, meanwhile, have to convince their professors to fly halfway around the world every year to keep the programs afloat. Otherwise, they must rely on part-time teachers and can no longer credibly say that the programs are similar to the American versions.</p>
        <p>The programs can become a large new revenue stream for the schools, however. Because companies often pay the tuition bills for their executives, business schools are sometimes able to charge considerably more for part-time programs than they do for full-time programs.</p>
        <p>Deans say most of the difference covers additional lodging and technology costs. Still, the numbers can quickly become attractive for academic institutions with modest budgets. For example, Duke will take in about $15 million this year solely from the students in its two international programs, one that meets both in Frankfurt and on the Duke campus in Durham, N.C., and the other that meets in several cities around the world over two years.</p>
        <p>There are intangible benefits, too, deans say.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the combination of a strong economy and a relatively small number of people in their 20's has caused applications to full-time M.B.A. programs to drop at most top schools the last two years. Without the continuing boom in foreign applicants, particularly from Asia, the drop would be even steeper. By building campuses overseas, the schools tap new pools of students who do not want to move to the United States for a full-time M.B.A. program and also broadcast their names to those who are considering a move.</p>
        <p>In addition, the new programs force faculty members to put their research in the context of another country. ''We can't just take our notes and use them in Europe or Asia without any changes,'' said Robert S. Hamada, Chicago's dean.</p>
        <p>This is not the first time that business schools have looked overseas. About a decade ago, as students and corporate executives were criticizing M.B.A. programs as too focused on the United States, some schools began offering classes abroad, too.</p>
        <p>One of the first was the University of Michigan, which began teaching M.B.A. classes in Hong Kong in 1991. It limited enrollment to the executives of a small group of companies that had agreed to support the program. Other schools, like Northwestern, have signed partnerships with foreign schools and award degrees jointly. But the Asian financial crisis delayed some of the most expensive projects, like Chicago's Singapore campus.</p>
        <p>Arguably the most ambitious of the current round of efforts is the Indian School of Business. Conceived by Rajat Gupta, a native of India who is McKinsey's managing director, the school plans to open next year in Hyderabad, a technology-heavy city in the south-central part of the country.</p>
        <p>The program will last one year and, unlike the Chicago and Duke programs, and will require students to quit their jobs to enroll full time. For faculty, the Indian school will rely on other universities -- mainly Northwestern and Pennsylvania -- for half of its teachers and hire its own professors for the other half.</p>
        <p>Tapping the local talent pool helps solve one of the biggest problems facing the globalization of the American business school: a decided lack of wanderlust on the part of some research-minded professors. ''The main challenge is how do you get your faculty to go to these locales year after year,'' said Russ Winter, a professor of marketing at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, who is on a committee now trying to decide whether the school should start a program in Asia. ''Two weeks or three weeks in a foreign locale is not conducive to research productivity.''</p>
