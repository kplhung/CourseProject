        <p>WHAT in the world can you do about the Internet?</p>
        <p>That's the question movie studios are pondering. On the one hand, the Internet could pose stiff competition for the movies, eventually enabling users to dial up whatever film they might like to see on demand, or, even more frightening to the studios, enabling young filmmakers to produce movies specifically for the Internet on the cheap. On the other hand, the Internet could prove to be more provender for the movies, with the studios not only getting a large cut of the on-demand action but also sponsoring those young Internet producers.</p>

        <p>WHAT in the world can you do about the Internet?</p>
        <p>That's the question movie studios are pondering. On the one hand, the Internet could pose stiff competition for the movies, eventually enabling users to dial up whatever film they might like to see on demand, or, even more frightening to the studios, enabling young filmmakers to produce movies specifically for the Internet on the cheap. On the other hand, the Internet could prove to be more provender for the movies, with the studios not only getting a large cut of the on-demand action but also sponsoring those young Internet producers.</p>
        <p>The problem is that the studios have no better idea of where the Internet is headed than anyone else. They must decide whether to take the initiative and steal a march on the future, with the enormous financial risks that entails, or wait to see what evolves, with the equally enormous risk that they will be left floating helplessly in the wake.</p>
        <p>This is hardly the first time that the studios have been confronted by a new and vexing technology. Indeed, the history of the movies is filled with technological threats that the studios either had to surmount or absorb. How the old moguls dealt with these seemingly seismic changes might even provide a lesson for the way their successors could deal with the Internet.</p>
        <p>The movie studios were especially sensitive to change because they owed their own existence, in large measure, to the myopia of the media establishment. When they first arrived early in the 20th century, movies were disdained by respectable Americans and corporate America as a novelty that appealed exclusively to the poor and uneducated in the nation's cities.</p>
        <p>That establishment could not imagine that the movies might endure and eventually lure the middle classes, which is why film production was originally left to Jews, Roman Catholics and other so-called marginal Americans. As one film publicist at the time put it, ''From the dregs and failures of every line poured the hordes out of which was to be welded mighty moviedom.''</p>
        <p>Even stage producers who might have forged useful alliances with the movies by lending their stars and material generally waited until it was too late, when the balance of power had already shifted to the studios. By the early 1920's, the very people who had sniffed contemptuously at the movies, the theater impresarios and Wall Street bankers, were desperate to invest in them.</p>
        <p>It would be more than a decade before the movies faced their own technological challenge: sound. For years there had been experiments linking sound to image -- Thomas Edison had conducted some of them -- but the major studios were reluctant to destabilize what was, by the mid-20's, a lucrative and rapidly expanding business.</p>
        <p>As long as no one studio pursued sound, all of them were content to let it simmer quietly despite the fact that Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, had devised a system linking recorded discs to projected film and was marketing it aggressively.</p>
        <p>As with most new technology, the only companies that had a stake in it were those that were not benefiting from the current system. Warner Brothers at the time was a small studio whose biggest star was Rin Tin Tin. Fox Pictures was larger and more successful than Warner Brothers, but its chief, William Fox, had designs on being the most powerful mogul of all and was searching for an angle that would enable him to do so. Both studios embarked simultaneously on plans to do movies with sound. Warner Brothers began in April 1926 with a sound-on-disc system called Vitaphone, which it licensed from Western Electric. Three months later, Fox started with a sound-on-film system called Movietone, which used an optical soundtrack like the ones used today.</p>
        <p>The major studios, called the Big Five, greeted these developments with bravado. After trying unsuccessfully to buy 50 percent of Vitaphone from Warner Brothers, they decided to boycott the service to hinder the renegade studio and to develop a sound system of their own under the auspices of the Radio Corporation of America, a division of General Electric. But while the Big Five dillydallied, Warner Brothers was outfitting its theaters with Vitaphone equipment and making Vitaphone films, and Fox was buying the new Roxy Theater in New York as a showcase for its Movietone system.</p>
        <p>By the time ''The Jazz Singer'' had its premiere in October 1927, and Al Jolson uttered the legendary words ''You ain't heard nothin' yet,'' the idea of sound was already well established. Largely on the strength of Vitaphone's prospects, Warner's stock skyrocketed in three years, to $132 a share from $21. At the same time, Fox was emboldened to engineer a takeover of MGM, the biggest and most successful studio.</p>
        <p>THAT Warner Brothers and Fox failed to drive the competition from the field had more to do with the corporate influence of the Big Five than with their ability to play catch-up. As William Fox later told it, the head of MGM, Louis B. Mayer, who was a big contributor to the Republican Party, used his contacts with the Hoover administration and the Justice Department's antitrust division to derail Fox's attempted takeover. At the same time, Western Electric, under pressure from the Big Five, contrived to cancel its exclusive Vitaphone contract with Warner Brothers. While Western Electric was extricating itself from its deal with Warner Brothers, RCA continued to develop a sound-on-film system for the major studios. Its Photophone would become the industry standard.</p>
        <p>So what can be learned from this? In the end, Warner Brothers was rewarded for its boldness and innovation, catapulting itself into the ranks of the majors. The Big Five dragged their feet, but by letting Warner Brothers and Fox lead the sound movement, they were able to wait until the bugs were worked out and an industrywide standard was accepted at very little risk or cost to themselves. Of course, they could do this because the government let them collude and bully. Even William Fox gained something after being punished by Louis Mayer for his hubris. Though he was later driven from the film business, Fox managed to obtain valuable German sound-on-film patents. In effect, everyone was a winner except Western Electric, which had pioneered the sound technology.</p>
        <p>Television, when it arrived 20 years later, proved to be a much more daunting challenge to the film industry than sound because it was not a technological addition; it was potential competition that threatened the very basis of the business.</p>
        <p>At its inception, however, television was viewed as an ally -- ''visual radio,'' some called it. Paramount had experimented with television technology and as early as 1938 had invested in the DuMont television company. Warner Brothers, MGM and Fox all filed applications for TV station licenses, and Paramount operated the first commercial station in Los Angeles. MGM even conducted negotiations to buy the Mutual Broadcasting Company, while 20th Century Fox negotiated with the American Broadcasting Company.</p>
        <p>What turned television from ally to enemy were the government's suspicions. The major film studios had been targets of an antitrust suit accusing them of collaborating to force theaters to accept films that exhibitors did not want in order to get films that they did want, and of squeezing out independent exhibitors by distributing their movies to their own theaters. The studios agreed to stop these practices under a consent decree, but the studios violated the decree and the government ordered them to sell their theater divisions in 1948. Their behavior, the Federal Communications Commission said, disqualified the studios from the television field. (Part of this animus was the thinking that the movie industry, which was unregulated by the F.C.C., catered only to majority tastes, while radio networks, which were regulated, had a history of heeding minority tastes should the networks enter television.)</p>
        <p>Television was suddenly a rival, especially because movie attendance, affected by postwar suburbanization and alternative entertainment options, dropped from 80 million admissions a week in 1946 to 50 million in 1949 -- just as television was making its appearance.</p>
        <p>Unable to own networks or stations, the studios declared war, refusing to sell films to television, opting instead to devise television of their own -- first with pay-per-view broadcasts of special events in specially equipped theaters, then with a home pay-per-view system that was a forerunner of cable. These experiments failed, and a standoff ensued -- television asking for films, the studios stubbornly refusing.</p>
        <p>What ended the stalemate was an agreement in 1954 between Walt Disney and ABC, then languishing in third place among networks, for a weekly television program, which, Disney said, would help advertise his movies. (ABC also agreed to help finance Disneyland.) This deal showed the possible synergies between the old medium and the new one, and other film companies reluctantly joined in, fearing they might be left behind.</p>
        <p>In 1955, the studios successfully defended themselves against another antitrust suit accusing them of colluding to withhold films from TV, but by then a sea change had occurred. The studios were not only selling their films to television, they were producing programming for it. By 1962, MCA, a former talent agency that had become a television production company, bought Universal Pictures -- symbolism that could hardly be lost on Hollywood. A young, ascendant medium had bought an older, declining one.</p>
        <p>The moral of this story is that even if the studios might have reaped greater profits had they conceded the issue and joined forces with the television networks earlier, there was no particular premium to those who jumped first, like Warner Brothers and Disney, and no particular penalty to those who bided their time. And that is the larger point as well. Whether an old conglomerate embraced the new technology or dithered made little difference in winning the media race as long as the conglomerate remained flexible.</p>
        <p>Unlike in the past, when the biggest studios hesitated over sound and then television, today's studios, almost all of which are parts of media conglomerates, are eager to embrace the Internet, lest they seem to be behind the curve. They just don't know what form that embrace should take -- whether the Internet is just a new and more nimble delivery system for traditional movies or a new medium or both. As a result, most are rushing headlong into the fray, figuring that if they do a little bit of everything, they won't be caught unawares. That is why studios are simultaneously preparing for on-demand systems and contracting with young filmmakers to produce short pictures for the studios' Web sites.</p>
        <p>It is a scattershot approach and it may prove costly, but studios don't feel they have the luxury of waiting to see where the Internet is really headed. In truth, no one knew where sound was headed or what television would ultimately become. Rather than invest in a course of action, the studios in the past decided to keep their options open as the technology evolved. Possibly because they operated in a kind of loose conspiracy that doesn't exist today, they felt they could advance together to the benefit of all. The strategy worked.</p>
        <p>In the final analysis, the studios realized that when it comes to new technology, it is not who gets there first that truly matters. What is most important is how one reacts once the technology is established and what one does with it. That is something today's studio heads might want to consider as they wade into the mysterious Internet future.</p>
