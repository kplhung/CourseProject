        <p>Two Stern's stores -- at 33rd Street and the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan and at the Nanuet Mall in Rockland County -- will close in March, the parent company, Federated Department Stores, announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Company officials said sales at the two stores had not grown enough to offset the costs of operating in those locations. The eight-story Manhattan store is hampered by limited space for selling and stocking goods, while the Nanuet store is too big, Federated said in a statement.</p>

        <p>Two Stern's stores -- at 33rd Street and the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan and at the Nanuet Mall in Rockland County -- will close in March, the parent company, Federated Department Stores, announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Company officials said sales at the two stores had not grown enough to offset the costs of operating in those locations. The eight-story Manhattan store is hampered by limited space for selling and stocking goods, while the Nanuet store is too big, Federated said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The two stores were formerly operated by A &amp; S.</p>
        <p>About 340 people work at the 33rd Street store and 126 at the Nanuet store. The company said employees in good standing would be given severance packages and priority in hiring at other Stern's stores. The company is opening a new Stern's store in South Brunswick, N.J., this fall and is remodeling other stores in Bay Shore, N.Y., Paramus, N.J., and Jersey City.</p>
