        <p>KYOCERA knives have all the cachet needed to persuade home cooks to plunk down $100: the endorsement of Ming Tsai, a celebrity chef; great press; a novel material (ceramic in the blades); and a beautiful design.</p>
        <p>Just one thing is missing: quality.</p>
        <p>The revolutionary ceramic blade, which is not supposed to need sharpening, has a decent edge. But it has almost no flexibility, so it will not bend as you work around the bones when carving a chicken, for instance.</p>
        <p>The largest knife, which is just six inches long, is also extremely light, which is not good when you're chopping. The problems were the same with all sizes of the knives, from a three-inch parer to a six-inch serrated bread knife.</p>
        <p>Oh, and by the way, these knives are fragile. The documentation that comes with them instructs you not to cut anything too hard and not to bang the knives or they may chip.</p>
        <p>''Lasts many months or years without sharpening,'' the pamphlet states, but then it offers no information about how to sharpen them.</p>
        <p>My stainless steel knives need sharpening -- a pleasurable skill worth learning. But they can also be banged against a cutting board to flatten a clove of garlic and can survive a fall to the floor without breaking my bank account.</p>
        <p>Kyocera ceramic knives are available from Professional Cutlery Direct, (800) 859-6994 or www.cutlery.com. Prices are $44.99 (three-inch parer) to $229.99 (six-inch chef's knife). At Broadway Panhandler, 477 Broome Street (Wooster Street), (212) 966-3434, they are $49.95 to $239.95.</p>
