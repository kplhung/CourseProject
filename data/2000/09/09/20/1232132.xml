        <p>The Honda Motor Company today became the third major Japanese company in the last month to issue an extensive product recall, warning owners of 551,924 vehicles that they might have potential oil leaks or audio wiring flaws that could cause fires.</p>
        <p>The recall was announced against a background of heightened sensitivity in corporate Japan about defective products.

        <p>The Honda Motor Company today became the third major Japanese company in the last month to issue an extensive product recall, warning owners of 551,924 vehicles that they might have potential oil leaks or audio wiring flaws that could cause fires.</p>
        <p>The recall was announced against a background of heightened sensitivity in corporate Japan about defective products. Earlier this month, the Transport Ministry punished the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation for systematically concealing consumer complaints about its cars and trucks for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>Honda said the recall had no relation to Mitsubishi's scandal, which resulted in the recall of one million Mitsubishi vehicles. ''It's just that the timing of the announcement came at this moment,'' Honda said through a spokesman. ''It's best to do it fast, but we had to study and assess the case before submitting it.''</p>
        <p>Honda, the No. 2 Japanese automaker behind Toyota Motor, said the recall affected vehicles sold mostly in Japan but included some Accord models sold in the United States.</p>
        <p>The company said wiring in audio equipment supplied by Alpine Electronics for 320,710 of its 1991-97 models that include the Accord, Prelude and Legend could overheat and cause speakers to ignite. Eleven instances of flare-ups or burning had been reported since June but no deaths or injuries.</p>
        <p>Honda said a defective oil seal that could cause leaks affected 231,214 of its 1993-95 models that include the Odyssey minivan and the Accord. No deaths or injuries were associated with the problem.</p>
        <p>Recalls are considered particularly embarrassing to Japanese manufacturers, historically known for their quality products.</p>
        <p>Automotive recalls in particular have been rising in Japan for years. According to the Ministry of Transport, there were 45 recalls in 1995 involving 150,000 vehicles. By last year, there were 132 recalls affecting 1.85 million vehicles.</p>
        <p>Takaki Nakanishi, an automobile analyst with Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, said the growth in recalls also reflected efforts by manufacturers to cut costs. ''They may use the most economic materials or cut certain phases of physical tests,'' he said. The surge in recalls, he said, ''are the flip side of the coin.''</p>
