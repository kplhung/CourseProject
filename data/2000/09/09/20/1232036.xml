        <p>MOST of his peers look at the Internet and see a threat to their livelihood, but Frank Armstrong sees a medium for spreading the gospel of financial discipline to those he could not reach otherwise.</p>
        <p>When he is not managing the finances of his wealthy clients from his office in Miami, Mr. Armstrong is serving as the chief investment strategist for DirectAdvice, an Internet company that says it is a low-price substitute for financial planners like Mr. Armstrong. DirectAdvice is one of several electronic services that have sprung up over the last year, offering investors advice on what to do with their money for as little as $50 a year.</p>
        <p>Many financial planners dismiss these start-ups as one-size-fits-all answers to problems that require personal attention and custom solutions. They also worry that investors will be attracted by the much lower fees these new services are charging.</p>
        <p>Clients can be dazzled by the speed and sophistication of the computerized tools these sites offer and begin to question why their planners charge so much more and do not offer them the tools as well. Most planners charge fees of 0.5 percent to 2 percent of their clients' assets.</p>
        <p>''There is no possible way I can take on a client relationship for $75 a year,'' said Mr. Armstrong, the president of Managed Account Services, whose clients typically have at least $1 million to invest. ''All those people who can't afford to come in and put $1 million on the table at this office still need advice.''</p>
        <p>The electronic feedback they could get from DirectAdvice for an annual fee of $75 or $100 may seem colder and more impersonal than the help they would get in face-to-face sessions with a human adviser, but it is still fairly sophisticated. These sites have graduated from the simple calculators that are available free throughout the Internet.</p>
        <p>Most take the same approach: they start by asking clients to fill out detailed electronic forms that outline their finances and their plans for spending and saving. In short order, they spit back suggestions of how to spread their money among stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Some, including AdviceAmerica and Financial Engines, recommend certain mutual funds to buy.</p>
        <p>AdviceAmerica, which is offering its services directly to consumers and through online brokerage firms, started out this year offering a one-year subscription to its online advisory service for just $49. That is half the price it plans to charge starting Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>Financial Engines, founded by the Nobel Prize-winning economist William F. Sharpe, was the first of these electronic services to throw a scare into financial professionals. It offers a free financial plan for subscribers, followed by an unlimited number of updates on their progress, for as little as $55 a year. So far, the service is limited to tax-deferred retirement savings accounts, like 401(k) plans.</p>
        <p>Michael McNamara, a consultant with Datamonitor in New York, said that these services were ''very useful at a basic level.'' He said that most of them seemed to provide smart advice on how investors should spread out their money, though some do not give detailed guidance on which stocks or mutual funds to buy.</p>
        <p>They may be good sources of advice for people with less than $100,000 to invest, Mr. McNamara said, but they cannot compete with brokers and planners who specialize in managing money for wealthy people. ''Things do become too complicated for any type of automated response,'' he said. ''The golden rule of brokers is 'know your customer.' But it's impossible for these types of services to really know you. They just know that you fit in Category D or Category A.''</p>
        <p>Even so, most financial planners feel threatened by these new competitors and the technology behind them, said Ed McCarthy, a retired financial planner and editor of the Financial Planning Association's Yourbiz Web site. ''The concern is the clients are going to look at them as not being on the cutting edge,'' he said. ''Clients are starting to request services that they are seeing online that the advisers might not have considered offering.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCarthy said that planners were frequently hearing questions from clients about Monte Carlo simulations. Normally, any mention of Monte Carlo would cause a planner to shudder, fearing that a client might gamble away his retirement savings. These inquiries make planners shudder for a different reason: a Monte Carlo simulation is what number crunchers call a program that calculates the likelihood that a client's retirement-savings plan will support his dreams for his golden years. Users can ask for a recalculation based on different variables, like a higher inflation rate or a lower savings rate.</p>
        <p>As sophisticated as they are, these tools are popping up on more and more Web sites, where they can often be used at no charge. Their easy availability is just one more factor that is contributing to the pressure on financial planners to make use of the Internet and other new technology or risk losing clients. Even advisers who do not think these electronic services are necessary or even helpful are providing them for fear of seeming too stodgy.</p>
        <p>With a tone of resignation, Michael Howard, the president of Emery &amp; Howard Portfolio Management in Burlingame, Calif., said his firm was preparing to grant clients the ability to electronically check on their accounts whenever and as often as they choose.</p>
        <p>''Most savvy investors don't want information that rapidly,'' said Mr. Howard, whose firm caters to multimillionaire entrepreneurs and executives in Silicon Valley. ''A lot of people don't even look. But you get a few who always look.''</p>
        <p>He dismisses the prospects of Internet-based companies, like MyCFO.com, a start-up backed by the Netscape founder Jim Clark, that hope to use a technological edge to lure wealthy clients away from traditional financial advisers. The financial lives of most affluent people are too complicated to be satisfied by impersonal, electronic systems, he said.</p>
        <p>But in running his own business, Mr. Armstrong has been surprised at how many people will turn over management of large sums of money to somebody they have never met. He said only about 20 percent of his clients lived in the Miami area. The rest are scattered worldwide, some as far away as China, and he communicates with them mostly through e-mail.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Armstrong said, most of his clients no longer listen in on periodic conference calls that he conducts to share his views on the financial markets. Now they can dial in to his Web site and hear and see the presentations when they want.</p>
        <p>Instead of a threat to his livelihood, the Internet ''is a humongous opportunity,'' he said. ''One hundred percent of my business comes from the Internet and my entire e-commerce initiative costs $58 a month.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Armstrong sees electronic advisers as a way of bridging the growing gulf between investors who can afford planners like Mr. Howard and the masses.</p>
        <p>As competition has squeezed prices, advisers have set their sights on richer clients whose fees will cover the costs of running their operations. Those costs include computers and servers to stay in constant touch with the brokerage firms that execute and process their trades, and software that manages bookkeeping and creates account statements.</p>
        <p>In raising their account minimums, Mr. Armstrong said, ''We've left orphan the entire middle class. The people who serve and build and make this country run.''</p>
        <p>AdviceAmerica estimates that almost 75 percent of American households do not have financial advisers. That is only in part because of the high cost, which can run into thousands of dollars a year.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of people with a lot of money who will never pay a financial adviser,'' Mr. Armstrong said. ''I'm surprised at the number of people with real wealth who use the DirectAdvice model. We get clients with amazing amounts of wealth.''</p>
