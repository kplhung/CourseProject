        <p>Derek Jeter was a rookie the first time he slapped his glove against the chest of Joe Torre during pitching changes, a silly and constructive tradition that usually extracts a small smile from his manager. But not tonight.</p>
        <p>Jeter tagged Torre with his mitt in the sixth inning of a humiliating 16-3 loss to Toronto, and Torre's concrete-block expression never changed. Torre was angry and disappointed, and in his mind, he was probably already formulating parts of the lecture he delivered after the game.</p>
        <p>''It was just bad,'' Torre said. ''It was just ugly, really ugly. We have to do something about it. It was terrible -- manager, coaches, players.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees embarrassed themselves with stunningly poor defense, allowed 19 hits and the margin of defeat matched the largest of the season for the defending champions. They cannot pass this wipeout off as an isolated instance, either; the Yankees have been saddled with one-sided defeats. They have lost five of their last six games by a composite score of 50-16.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, when the Yankees were on their way to a record 125 victories, they punctuated a brief September malaise with a horrible performance against Tampa Bay, and Torre stalked into the clubhouse after the game and launched into a blistering tirade, something he rarely does. He was more measured after tonight's game, measured but direct, insistent that his team start increasing it's level of energy. ''We've been a club that's pretty much taken the bull by the horns,'' he said, ''and we need to do that again.''</p>
        <p>Jeter said: ''We're playing terrible, and that's the bottom line. We're not hitting, we're not pitching, we're not playing defense.''</p>
        <p>Jeter speculated that perhaps the Yankees had begun to rely on their large lead -- ''a luxury,'' he called it -- and assumed they will make the playoffs and merely coast through the rest of the schedule. Bernie Williams added: ''Any time you go out and lose by that many runs, it's kind of like a wake-up call.''</p>
        <p>Only three alarms, so far. The Yankees' advantage over Boston in the American League East is a formidable six games with only 13 games remaining, so they are in no serious jeopardy of losing their post-season berth. But they are playing poorly at a time when they should be gaining momentum, and if their performance is not stabilized, they could forfeit home-field advantage to the winner of the A.L. West in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had a slam-dunk matchup tonight. Before the game, Torre got a message from the Toronto Manager Jim Fregosi, who called to say David Wells was scratched from his start because of gout in his big toe. Wells might pitch Thursday, but the right-hander Steve Trachsel was tabbed to start in his place tonight. Williams was in the lineup, his first action against a right-handed pitcher in two weeks. Pettitte was shooting for his 19th victory.</p>
        <p>But Pettitte struggled early -- he blamed himself for not taking charge and setting a tone -- and the Yankees' defense undermined him. Chuck Knoblauch fielded a grounder in the first inning, and the first baseman Tino Martinez set himself as he usually does when preparing for Knoblauch's throws: Feet set wide apart, arms at his sides, as if he's about to tackle a heifer. Knoblauch tossed the ball right at Martinez's feet, directly in front of him, and Martinez, caught in an awkward position, dropped the ball for an error.</p>
        <p>With one out, Carlos Delgado lifted a high fly to left, where Luis Polonia drifted over for the ball, looking completely in control, calm and confident right up to the moment that the pop bounced 20 feet from him for a hit. A run scored. Shannon Stewart beat out a infield hit in the third to spur a two-run rally, and Scott Brosius fumbled a grounder in the fifth. Pettitte (18-8) was knocked out in the sixth, replaced by Jason Grimsley, having surrendered seven runs (five earned) on eight hits and three walks, and Pettitte failed to produce a strikeout.</p>
        <p>Faced with another huge deficit, the Yankees' hitters barely dented Trachsel, who allowed four hits, two walks and three runs over seven and one-third innings. Toronto led by 7-2 after six innings and it felt like 77-2, and that was before the Blue Jays feasted on the rookie relievers.</p>
        <p>Ted Lilly, one of the rookie left-handers contending for a spot on the postseason roster, faced four batters in the seventh and couldn't get an out, and Toronto built its lead to 11-2 after seven. Randy Choate, another rookie left-hander, faced three batters and couldn't get an out, and threw so poorly that Torre yanked him even with the left-handed hitter Brad Fullmer coming to bat. Craig Dingman replaced Choate and the first four batters he faced hit singles, extending the Toronto lead to 16-3. One fan sitting behind home plate kept screaming, ''Mercy!'' and mockingly begged for Torre to make more pitching changes.</p>
        <p>Torre made his last trip to the mound in the eighth, taking the ball from Choate. The manager and Jeter and the other infielders waited on the mound for Dingman, none of them saying anything.</p>
        <p>Jeter didn't slap his manager on the chest with his glove this time. There was no way to defuse the tension will continue to build until the Yankees play better, no way to defuse the embarrassment, and there were no smiles to extract.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BERNIE WILLIAMS had been cleared to bat right-handed and expected to start against the left-hander DAVID WELLS Tuesday night, but when he arrived at Skydome this afternoon, Manager JOE TORRE told that Wells had been scratched and replaced by the right-hander STEVE TRACHSEL. Then Torre sat silently, waiting for Williams's reaction; he wants his center fielder to be absolutely sure his rib cage strain is better, so that he does not risk carrying a serious injury into the post-season. Williams told Torre he felt fine. ''O.K., you're in,'' Torre said.</p>
