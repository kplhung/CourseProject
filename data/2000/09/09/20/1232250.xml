        <p>Recent workouts have indicated that Michael Johnson is fit enough to break his own world record in the 400 meters on Monday at the Sydney Games, the sprinter and his coach said today.</p>
        <p>Wind and cool temperatures, along with the physical drain of running four rounds in four days could ultimately affect his speed. But Johnson has run faster workouts than he did last August before he set the world record of 43.18 seconds at the 1999 world track and field championships in Seville, Spain, said his coach, Clyde Hart.</p>
        <p>Before Seville, Johnson ran a pair of 350-meter repeats, with four minutes of rest, in 43.2 seconds and 42.80 seconds, Hart said. Two days ago, Johnson did the repeats in 42.2 and 42.4, the coach said. The sprinter has said that he believes he is capable of running under 43 seconds, and desires to put his 400 record into the same rarefied position as his remarkable time of 19.32 seconds at 200 meters.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to have my 400 world record equal to my 200 world record, so far out there that it's hard to understand,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>He has long recovered from the hamstring cramp that forced him to pull up in the 200 at the Olympic trials in July, Johnson said. His main concern is being vigilant about a chronically sore left Achilles' tendon. But the recent workouts gave him confidence that his record could fall under the right conditions, Hart said.</p>
        <p>''Mentally, it had to help him feel like he's prepared to run well,'' Hart said.</p>
        <p>Johnson said his main concern was to win. And, barring injury, that seems a certainty. He has lost only 3 of 81 quarter-mile races in the past 11 years. No man has ever repeated as Olympic champion in the quarter-mile. Marie-Jose Perec of France has won the women's quarter-mile at the past two Olympics.</p>
        <p>''It's something that's very important to the end of my career,'' Johnson said of repeating. ''I've always been motivated by making history.''</p>
        <p>If the 400 record is to fall here, Hart said, it will have to come in the final 100 meters. He wants Johnson to run the first 200 in about 20.8 seconds and to come through 300 in about 31.5. The goal is for Johnson to run the final 100 in 11.2 seconds, which would put him well under 43 seconds.</p>
