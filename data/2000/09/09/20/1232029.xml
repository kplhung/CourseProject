        <p>I HAVE never been the kind of person who has a shopping outfit, a special no-fuss ensemble that can be whipped off to try on clothes and reassembled in record time without leaving a hair out of place.</p>
        <p>Nor do I enjoy seeing myself in one unflattering outfit after another until I find just the right one. And so I end up dreading (and avoiding) clothes shopping.</p>
        <p>Until the arrival of the virtual dressing room. The online version of ''trying on'' clothes seemed tailored for me, because it allows shoppers to create virtual versions of themselves and see how different outfits look without so much as fastening a hook.</p>
        <p>I was particularly charmed by the idea of creating a cyberself who would shop tirelessly until hitting pay dirt. And so I headed first to Lands' End, which uses technology created by Public Technologies Multimedia Inc. of Montreal to create an online likeness. Lands' End's senior vice president for e-commerce, Bill Bass, said that 1.5 million virtual models had been created since the company began offering the service two years ago.</p>
        <p>This virtual dressing room provides pull-down menus that offer selections of hip size (small, medium or large), bust size (small or large) and waist size (well-defined or not), and color-coded charts to select hairstyle and color, face shape and skin color. The result of my selections was a virtual self who appeared in a black camisole and offered me fashion tips based on my figure.</p>
        <p>Therein lay the first problem: my cyberbody did not look too much like me. Frankly, I thought she looked a little hippy. I tried on a pale blue silk Shantung suit, from Lands' End, which was recommended for my figure. Based on my virtual self, the outfit ended up in the return pile, though I was not sure how it would have really looked on me.</p>
        <p>It didn't matter because it was kind of fun. In fact, I spent a good half-hour trying to make my virtual self look good in the outfits. I tried bathing suits, jeans and several black dresses. It was an inexact science at best. Even if I could minimize my cyberbody's flaws, were they the same figure flaws that I have myself?</p>
        <p>The problem is that it is nearly impossible to produce an accurate image of one's self merely by selecting a hip size and choosing a hairstyle and other variables. For one thing, you're stuck with the model's face, and changes to her measurements don't change her appearance too much. The current online modeling technology makes the experience more fun than catalog shopping, but scarcely more accurate.</p>
        <p>That will soon change, according to Louise Guay, the founder and president of MyVirtualModel.com., a division of Public Technologies Multimedia that created the model for Lands' End. Ms. Guay said that the company's newer version of the technology, slated for next month, would have more precise measurements, look less cartoony and include a model for men. Customers would either use a tape measure to supply their own measurements or, in future versions, can have a full-body scan of their figures measured in a van that would move from store to store.</p>
        <p>The scanning concept, however, has its disadvantages. The technology is costly and  is not used widely, so customers would have a difficult time finding a scanner in stores or coming across one of the vans to create virtual versions of themselves.</p>
        <p>Then there is the issue of vanity. Scanning can produce flat images that do not resemble customers' figures, even though the images are based on accurate data. Nor is scanning a boon to the self-conscious shopper, who may not want to undress in a scanning booth and have a video camera transfer a virtual self, flaws and all, onto a computer screen.</p>
        <p>Ms. Guay said that her company's scanning software would put ''a layer of beauty'' over the scan, thereby reducing the number of physical flaws and skin imperfections, making customers' cyberbodies look a little better. This does, of course, beg the question of how customers will look in the clothes they buy online once the ''layer of beauty'' has been removed.</p>
        <p>Other companies try to take the guesswork out of online shopping by applying more education to the guess. EZsize.com and Yourfit.com are also hoping to capitalize on technology designed to model clothes online. Both companies are marketing technology to online retailers that will allow customers to specify measurements and try on different-size clothes on virtual bodies on the computer, which should take the mystery out of selecting a size.</p>
        <p>Another company, The Right Size (www.therightsize.com), asks customers to supply information about their own best-fitting, most-liked clothes and then returns a list of the clothes that most closely fits the profile. The technology uses ''dynamic clustering,'' a method used by weather forecasters to predict patterns. It seeks to reduce merchandise returns from online shoppers.</p>
        <p>''The No. 1 fear of consumers in buying through e-commerce or catalogs is, 'Will it fit me?' '' said Ernesto Aguirre, who founded The Right Size, which will be available in October to shoppers on J. C. Penney's Web site (www.jcpenney.com), which is currently using MyVirtualModel technology for large sizes.</p>
        <p>OTHER retailers are also grappling with the problem of fit. The Interactive Custom Clothes Company (www.ic3d.com), an online retailer in New York, allows shoppers to construct a pair of pants based on exact measurements or on an existing pair of favorite jeans. Peter del Rio, the company's co-founder and chief executive, said, ''Everyone wants to have the ability to visualize themselves and go 'Click, click, click,' and receive it in 48 hours to find it fits them perfectly.''</p>
        <p>The technology lets customers choose the number of pockets and rivets, the exact weight and texture of fabric and the amount of tapering on the leg, among other details. Because each pair of pants is custom-made,  the price rises to $80 a pair.</p>
        <p>After selecting all the details, customers can view their pants on screen, though not on a virtual model. A result, said one customer, Tana Noble, is a perfect fit without ever trying anything on.</p>
        <p>''For the first time in my life I have a pair of jeans that fit,'' Ms. Noble said.</p>
        <p>The virtual modeling experience does not stop there. Sites like EZface.com allow shoppers to try different makeup styles before buying, and eMakeover.com adds the choice of hairstyles. Compucloz.com allows shoppers to try different pairs of glasses on a model's face, with the option of inserting their own faces from a CD-ROM or a digital camera.</p>
        <p>The virtual dressing room still has a long way to go. Many existing programs are more like animated catalogs than substitutes for the real dressing room. But they're certainly fun to play with.</p>
        <p>A Virtual Spree on Rodeo Drive</p>
        <p>EVERYBODY knows that there are some things the Web cannot do, like recreate the experience of meandering along one of the world's great shopping streets -- say, the Champs-Elysees or Madison Avenue.</p>
        <p>But this is an era when you can fire up your browser and hop into a royal blue Mercedes-Benz convertible for a virtual cruise along Rodeo Drive.</p>
        <p>The trip, at www.rodeodrive.com, starts at the north end of the Beverly Hills thoroughfare. As the convertible rolls past cartoon storefronts, clicking on the arrows provides a side view of the car, as if it is parked in front of stores like Fendi, Cartier, Gucci or Tiffany.</p>
        <p>Another click provides ''entry'' into each store, which in some cases means a store's Web site of goods, and in other cases means a black screen with the promise of a site coming soon.</p>
        <p>Given current technology, the trip proves that if you are a cartoon, you might look real to yourself but not to anybody else. Instead, you can think of the site as a harbinger of the online malls that Famousstreets.com plans to create from 202 shopping streets. More broadly, the Rodeo Drive site suggests ways in which famous places can use the locationless Web to stake a claim in e-commerce.</p>
        <p>''Every city has its Rodeo Drive equivalent,'' said Vince Ceccola, the president and founder of World Wide Webs Inc., which produced Rodeodrive.com and in turn spawned Famousstreets.com.</p>
        <p>The idea is to transport online shoppers to remote places, where they can browse boutiques on streets that include Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, Fla., and Fifth Avenue in New York. The company is working with business-improvement districts in cities worldwide to introduce 200 famous street sites in five years, at $2 million to $5 million a site.</p>
        <p>The company will pay a royalty to each business district for use of the street name, plus a percentage of the revenue from advertising. The stores on the street sites pay nothing. That is a shift in the business model since the introduction of Rodeodrive.com, which required individual stores to pay $1,000 to $100,000 for Web site development, plus a monthly fee of $200.</p>
        <p>Streets scheduled to go online this year include the Las Vegas Strip, Madison Avenue and Wall Street in New York and Michigan Avenue in Chicago. A Broadway site will allow theatergoers to buy tickets to New York shows and watch previews.</p>
        <p>But virtual reality can go only so far. You'll always have Paris -- you just have to go there.</p>
