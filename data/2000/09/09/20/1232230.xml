        <p>On a Friday afternoon in December, F.B.I. agents arrested one of the Democratic Party's most generous contributors as he picked up his Mercedes from a garage in suburban New Jersey. Within hours, the man was locked in a nearby jail, charged with making illegal donations to Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat.</p>
        <p>The donor, David Chang, spent only that weekend in the Hudson County Correctional Center. But while he lay alone in his cell, he was visited by several men he had never seen before, he later told prosecutors. One of the men warned him not to talk to the government, he said. Another simply put a finger to his lips.</p>
        <p>Now, as part of a widening inquiry in which Mr. Chang has become a crucial witness, federal investigators are examining the possibility that the men were sent by political allies of Senator Torricelli as part of an effort to pressure Mr. Chang into not cooperating with the authorities, people familiar with the investigation said.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, three guards who were in the jail that weekend have been called before a federal grand jury, and F.B.I. agents have seized log books, personnel files, videotapes and other records.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors are also preparing to question the man who supervises the three guards, a senior prison official who is a longtime friend of Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County executive. Mr. Janiszewski, in turn, is one of Mr. Torricelli's most steadfast supporters in the state.</p>
        <p>The senior prison official, Martin Budnick, did nothing improper, his lawyer, Peter R. Willis, said in an interview. But Mr. Budnick, who generally works Monday through Friday, has told associates that he went  to the jail over the weekend of Dec. 11 at the behest of one of Mr. Janiszewski's top aides. Mr. Budnick insisted to the associates that he merely ordered that Mr. Chang be given an extra blanket and some food.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli, the Democratic Party's chief fund-raiser in the Senate, said through a spokesman that any suggestion that he was part of an effort to threaten Mr. Chang was ''wrong, ridiculous and preposterous.'' Asked whether anyone on Mr. Torricelli's staff contacted county officials while Mr. Chang was in custody, the spokesman, Eric Shuffler, said he would have to check. He did not call back or respond to further messages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Janiszewski denied any involvement in the way that Mr. Chang was treated. A lawyer for Mr. Chang, Bradley D. Simon, declined to comment, citing the continuing federal inquiry.</p>
        <p>Until his arrest last year, Mr. Chang, 56, was one of the more prized donors in American politics. He visited with senators and congressmen and had a particularly close relationship with Mr. Torricelli, who had been his congressman before being elected to the Senate. Mr. Chang had met with President Clinton half a dozen times, both at casual get-togethers and White House galas.</p>
        <p>But on June 2, Mr. Chang pleaded guilty to organizing more than $53,000 in illegal donations to Mr. Torricelli's 1996 campaign. In return, the government dropped other, more serious charges, including conspiracy and obstruction of justice.</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Chang has become a crucial witness for the Justice Department's campaign-finance task force, which is examining whether members of Mr. Torricelli's campaign staff might have been complicit in Mr. Chang's illegal contributions. Mr. Torricelli has denied any wrongdoing, saying Mr. Chang and five others who have pleaded guilty to making illegal donations to his campaign acted entirely on their own.</p>
        <p>After his weekend in the jail, Mr. Chang appeared in court on Monday, Dec. 13, and his lawyer at the time, Michael Critchley, suggested that his client had no intention of cooperating with the authorities. Mr. Critchley said his client knew of nothing incriminating about any of the politicians with whom he had dealt -- not Mr. Torricelli, not President Clinton, not anyone else.</p>
        <p>The next day, after being moved out of the Hudson jail to the Union County jail in Elizabeth, N.J., Mr. Chang hired a new lawyer, David Schertler, and began to distance himself from Mr. Critchley.</p>
        <p>According to people familiar with Mr. Chang's account of his time in the Hudson jail, the first of several visitors appeared at the door of his cell on Saturday night, Dec. 11. One man, whom Mr. Chang described as tall and burly with a tattoo on his arm, warned him not to cooperate with the authorities, telling him, ''You know what you are supposed to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chang told investigators that  he assured the man and another standing behind him that he would not ''betray his friends,'' according to people familiar with his account.</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Chang told investigators, he was awakened in his cell by  another man who put a finger to his lips, motioning him to keep quiet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chang reported at least one more visit, this one from a man who brought him a blanket and some food. Lawyers for Mr. Chang have said that he complained of being cold and ill-fed during his stay in the jail.</p>
        <p>The federal investigation into Mr. Chang's detention began almost six months later, shortly after he pleaded guilty to reduced charges of campaign-finance violations.</p>
        <p>In late July, F.B.I. agents began conducting interviews at the jail and took away a log book of visitors to Mr. Chang's wing and other records, said a county spokeswoman, Julie St. Jean.</p>
        <p>Other records taken from the jail included videotapes of people entering the wing where federal prisoners were held as well as attendance sheets and personnel files for Mr. Budnick and the three corrections officers he supervised as head of the jail's gang-intelligence unit.</p>
        <p>The three officers -- Lt. Kelvin Roberts, Enrique Marrero and James Nieves -- all appeared before a federal grand jury on Aug. 24, county officials said.</p>
        <p>According to two prison employees who spoke on the condition that they not be named, Mr. Budnick and the three corrections officers went to the jail on the Saturday night of Mr. Chang's stay and were logged in as visiting other prisoners in his cell block.</p>
        <p>Mr. Budnick, who is also responsible for the administration of the roughly 300 federal inmates usually held at the jail, told county officials that he and the three officers were there to investigate a fight between two prisoners earlier in the day.</p>
        <p>Later, however, Mr. Budnick told lawyers and others that he had sent the blanket to Mr. Chang after receiving a telephone call from William Northgrave, the county counsel. Mr. Budnick told an associate that Mr. Northgrave telephoned him a second time and warned him not to disclose their dealings on the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Northgrave declined to comment on that accusation and said he could not discuss what happened during Mr. Chang's detention until the federal inquiry was over.</p>
        <p>''We have been fully cooperating with the federal authorities since the beginning,'' he said. A lawyer for the three guards, Daniel J. Welsh, said any accusation that they tried to intimidate Mr. Chang was ''completely unfounded.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Northgrave has ties to several people who figure in the inquiry. He once served as Mr. Janiszewski's chief of staff and was an associate at the law firm of Michael Critchley, the lawyer who first represented Mr. Chang when he was jailed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Janiszewski, in an interview in his Jersey City office, strongly defended Mr. Budnick.</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Budnick had been involved in law enforcement for 15 years or more, both operationally and administratively. ''This guy,'' he said, ''simply would not be doing anything improper. What do I think happened? Nothing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Budnick, 49, has already survived some legal difficulties in his work for Hudson County.</p>
        <p>After only several years as a police officer, Mr. Budnick was named a county undersheriff in 1987, and kept the post for a decade with Mr. Janiszewski's support.</p>
        <p>Starting in 1993, however, Mr. Budnick was one of two lead defendants in sexual-harassment lawsuits that were filed by seven women working in the Sheriff's Department and eventually settled for a total of more than $1.4 million, not including legal fees.</p>
        <p>In July 1999, Mr. Budnick resigned his post under pressure from the sheriff, Joseph Cassidy, officials in the office said. Nonetheless, he remained on the county payroll with Mr. Janiszewski's backing, moving to a job as ''confidential aide'' to the warden of the jail, Ralph Green.</p>
        <p>At the jail, Mr. Budnick has worked with wide authority, reporting frequently to Mr. Janiszewski, several of his co-workers said.</p>
        <p>The jail itself has also had a tumultuous past and Mr. Janiszewski has taken a strong hand in its operations.</p>
        <p>In January 1996, after years of complaints by senior guards and others, the jail was taken over by the state, when 160 state corrections officers in riot gear swept into the building at Mr. Janiszewski's invitation.</p>
        <p>The state ran the jail for nearly a year, until Mr. Janiszewski restored Mr. Green as the warden and placed control of the corrections department under the sheriff's office.</p>
        <p>That arrangement lasted only 17 days, however, until Mr. Cassidy again sought to remove Mr. Green. Then, the Board of Freeholders quickly took the jail back from the sheriff's office and established a separate corrections department.</p>
