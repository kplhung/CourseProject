        <p>A small plane that the Cuban government said was hijacked from that country's western province this morning apparently ran out of fuel and crashed into the Gulf of Mexico, killing one man and leaving nine other people clinging to debris in rough seas.</p>
        <p>The survivors, including one man who suffered severe head injuries when the plane dropped into the gulf about 300 miles off the Florida coast, were rescued by the crew of a passing cargo ship, the Chios Dream.</p>
        <p>The crew of the Panamanian-registered cargo ship found nine survivors -- three men, three women and three children -- and the body of a 10th person apparently killed when the plane went down, said United States Coast Guard officials.</p>
        <p>Details about the flight, the people aboard and their chances of remaining in the United States or being returned to Cuba were incomplete late this evening, as a Coast Guard cutter and rescue aircraft headed to meet the cargo ship and transport the most seriously injured to hospitals, probably in Key West or Miami, United States officials said.</p>
        <p>The man with the head injuries was the only one that American officials were expected to bring to the United States for treatment, said one  Clinton administration official.</p>
        <p>The plane, a single-engine Antonov AN-2 Colt believed to have been used for crop dusting, was headed west-northwest, away from Cuba and Florida, when it went down, the Coast Guard said.</p>
        <p>The plane took off from the Herradura Airport in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, at about 9 a.m. Just minutes later, Havana air traffic controllers radioed air traffic controllers in Miami, saying the plane had been hijacked.</p>
        <p>Air traffic controllers in Florida never made contact with the plane, and Coast Guard jets searched the area where the plane was first believed to have gone down, about 90 miles southwest of Key West.</p>
        <p>But the plane's wreckage, and the survivors, were found more than 200 miles away in the Yucatan Channel, just 60 miles from the western tip of Cuba.</p>
        <p>The last such hijacking was in 1991, when five Cubans landed safely at Miami International Airport.</p>
        <p>The 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act allows Cubans who reach shore in the United States to apply for residency.</p>
        <p>Uncontrolled immigration, often on rafts and through smuggling, has prompted the governments of both countries to reach accords to discourage the often dangerous journeys from the island.</p>
        <p>Under new agreements, 20,000 Cubans are allowed to immigrate to the United States each year.</p>
        <p>But Cuban officials still criticize the 1966 law. Cubans interdicted at sea are most often returned, while those who make it onto dry land -- the so-called wet foot, dry foot policy -- are still most often granted asylum.</p>
        <p>The case of the nine survivors is further complicated by the fact that they may have committed a crime in hijacking the plane.</p>
        <p>''Hijacking the plane is an international crime,'' said one American  official. ''That person would certainly be excludable.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton, asked about the flight today, said he knew ''there will be a lot of questions about what should be done with the survivors. I think the more important thing now is to worry about their care.''</p>
        <p>Those who are not evacuated for medical attention will likely be taken to the United States naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
        <p>In Miami, Cuban-Americans blamed Fidel Castro's record of human rights abuses as the cause for the flight.</p>
        <p>''It shows the extent of what people go through,'' said Jorge Mas Santos, who heads the Cuban American National Foundation here.</p>
