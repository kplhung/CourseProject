        <p>Only a few years ago, Ron Dixon was out of football and pumping gas. While the days dragged on, he still maintained a belief that one day he would be in the National Football League, though he had little to back that up other than speed to burn and memories of being a hot prospect in high school.</p>
        <p>His friends speak on his behalf. But Dixon had his detractors.</p>
        <p>''Of course, people didn't believe me,'' he said. ''You get some people who really know you and they would be like, 'If he gets a break I can see him doing that.' But I had one incident where one of my friends said that I was going to the N.F.L. and this guy said, ''What, as a water boy?' I'm still looking for that dude to this day. I hope he was watching on Sunday.''</p>
        <p>At age 24, Dixon has not only made good on his promise to make it to the N.F.L., but he is making an impact sooner than perhaps even he expected. The Giants' rookie receiver hauled in a 34-yard touchdown pass over Chicago Bears cornerback Thomas Smith on Sunday for the first score of his career, and he is confident that there is more to come.</p>
        <p>That boast, however, will bring few nonbelievers to the front these days. But Dixon has moved up the depth chart since his arrival as a third-round pick out of tiny Lambuth University.</p>
        <p>Throughout training camp, Dixon's speed and skills belied the humble path he had taken to the league. His journey began in 1993, when as a junior in high school, he was recruited by the University of Florida and committed, joining a cadre of receivers that included his current Giants teammate, Ike Hilliard.</p>
        <p>But when Dixon's grades did not pan out as a senior and he did not achieve the A.C.T. score necessary to become eligible, Florida backed off. Dixon then committed to the University of Central Florida, which sent him to Itawamba Community College in Fulton, Miss.</p>
        <p>After one season, he transferred to West Georgia in 1996, but his grades again floundered and Dixon was out of football.</p>
        <p>Dixon was later recruited to the Canadian league, but had to turn down the offer because of a knee injury. He then landed at Lambuth University, an NAIA school, in 1999. By this time, his National Collegiate Athletic Association eligibility had expired.</p>
        <p>If there was rust on his game after two years of being away from football, it quickly dissipated. By the third game, Dixon was rolling, grabbing three touchdown passes and running a punt back 95 yards for a score. On the season, he caught 89 passes for 1,735 yards and 19 touchdowns. He had caught the eye of N.F.L. scouts.</p>
        <p>''I would get frustrated sometimes, but I always knew I was going to make it to the N.F.L.,'' Dixon said. ''My trip was just delayed for a while. I had confidence. I don't think everyone could have gone the route I went and made it. I learned a lot from the path I took. I'm more appreciative of things.''</p>
        <p>Making it to the N.F.L. was just half the battle. For as much potential as Dixon showed, he was also equally raw. Dixon was yanked off punt returns after fumbling twice in one preseason game, but Coach Jim Fassel and the offensive coordinator Sean Payton have tried to figure ways to get the ball in his hands. That is evidenced by the end around against the Bears that he took for 12 yards as well as the 24 yards he has averaged on kickoff returns.</p>
        <p>''One thing, he is explosive and he can run,'' Payton said. ''Boy, that was evident from the day he arrived here. He's a quick learner, so as you prepare for the game, you can put some things in for him. There are a number of things that he needs to clean up that he can be better with. I think that will come.''</p>
        <p>Fassel added: ''He has an instinct about him. He has an understanding of the game. We all have our things we understand real well. Artists know how to put pictures together. Architects know how to build buildings. Well, he has a real sense about the game of football, the movement, the skill and the understanding.''</p>
        <p>That has helped Dixon acclimate himself as he moves from stadiums that topped out at 1,000 fans to hearing 77,000 die-hards screaming for him.</p>
        <p>''It's something that I'm getting used to,'' Dixon said. ''It was weird at first, but I got used to it and it's like playing in front of 30 people. It's not really a big difference.''</p>
        <p>Referring to a 90-yard kickoff return in the final preseason game, he added: ''When I scored my touchdown here, I didn't even hear the crowd. During the run, I just didn't hear it. Running back to the sideline I did. It's nice. It's getting better each day here. It's going to be wonderful.''</p>
