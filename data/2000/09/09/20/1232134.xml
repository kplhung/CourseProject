        <p>Flush with Coca-Cola, chocolate chip cookies and cigarettes, Christopher Rivera, 34, unfastened a 47-foot maintenance boat from its pier, revved up the engine and set off on a moonlight cruise from Staten Island on Monday night, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Mr. Rivera but luckily for the Department of Transportation, which owns the vessel and uses it to take repair workers to piers not accessible by land, the hapless sailor ran out of fuel 200 yards from the spot near St. George where the boat had been docked.</p>
        <p>Officers from the Police Department's Harbor Unit found the boat there early yesterday morning after city workers reported that the boat was bobbing in the water, two piers south of its regular resting spot.</p>
        <p>Officers who went to the scene found the windows of the boat, a buoy tender, shattered and its door locked, said Sgt. Kelly Fitzpatrick of the Harbor Unit's commuter ferry squad. When they entered the sleeping compartment, they also found Mr. Rivera, asleep on a mattress.</p>
        <p>''As soon as we cracked the door, he popped his head up,'' Sergeant Fitzpatrick said. ''He said, 'Who are you?' ''</p>
        <p>The officers, who were in uniform, identified themselves, and Mr. Rivera, who had snacks and cigarettes but no identification, said he had been released from a New Jersey jail on Thursday. He did not intend to steal the boat, he said, and was merely searching for a place to sleep.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera, who the police said is homeless, could not explain why he untied the boat or started its engine if all he wanted was an empty mattress, Sergeant Fitzpatrick said. ''He didn't go into why he started it,'' he said. ''He just said he was looking for a place to stay.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera acknowledged that he was no nautical expert. ''He said he had taken some accounting,'' Sergeant Fitzpatrick said.</p>
        <p>Had Mr. Rivera known a bit more about boating, he might have gone farther. There was enough fuel in the boat to travel a couple of hundred nautical miles, Sergeant Fitzpatrick said, but Mr. Rivera did not know how to turn the fuel on. Residual fuel in the engine powered the boat for the 200 yards that Mr. Rivera managed to travel, he said.</p>
        <p>And although Mr. Rivera unfastened one rope attaching the boat to a work barge near shore, he did not unfasten the boat's electrical connection to the barge. That wire was severed when the boat left the pier.</p>
        <p>An official at the Hudson County Jail confirmed that Mr. Rivera was held there for 12 days after being arrested in Hoboken, but would not say what he was charged with. New York police have charged him with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.</p>
        <p>''He seemed a little down on his luck,'' Sergeant Fitzpatrick said.</p>
