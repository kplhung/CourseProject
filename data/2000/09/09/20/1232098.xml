        <p>Suddenly Emmylou Harris is a full-fledged songwriter. She has spent most of her 25-year career recording other people's music, occasionally placing a song of her own on an album. But for her new ''Red Dirt Girl'' (Nonesuch), she simply decided to write a whole album, then proceeded to come up with 11 of its 12 songs. That gave her a small problem with stage patter when she started a three-night stand on Monday night at Joe's Pub (425 Lafayette Street, East Village). ''I usually preface songs with who wrote them,'' she said ruefully. ''But I wrote them, so I don't know what to say.''</p>
        <p>The songs say enough on their own. After years at the intersection of traditionalist country, country rock and folk rock, Ms. Harris remade her music on her 1995 album, ''Wrecking Ball.'' Working with the producer and songwriter Daniel Lanois, she moved her slender, reedy voice into a realm of echoing guitars and muffled drums. Where she had once sung mostly about love, she took up biblical language to sing about pilgrimages of heart and spirit.</p>

        <p>Suddenly Emmylou Harris is a full-fledged songwriter. She has spent most of her 25-year career recording other people's music, occasionally placing a song of her own on an album. But for her new ''Red Dirt Girl'' (Nonesuch), she simply decided to write a whole album, then proceeded to come up with 11 of its 12 songs. That gave her a small problem with stage patter when she started a three-night stand on Monday night at Joe's Pub (425 Lafayette Street, East Village). ''I usually preface songs with who wrote them,'' she said ruefully. ''But I wrote them, so I don't know what to say.''</p>
        <p>The songs say enough on their own. After years at the intersection of traditionalist country, country rock and folk rock, Ms. Harris remade her music on her 1995 album, ''Wrecking Ball.'' Working with the producer and songwriter Daniel Lanois, she moved her slender, reedy voice into a realm of echoing guitars and muffled drums. Where she had once sung mostly about love, she took up biblical language to sing about pilgrimages of heart and spirit.</p>
        <p>She has held on to Mr. Lanois's sound with her band Spyboy, which envelops her voice rather than simply accompanies it. Above the band's generally somber pulse, Ms. Harris's new songs contemplate existential quests and pleas. ''Bang the drum slowly,'' she sang in one, ''I'll speak of things holy.''</p>
        <p>Her melodies are rooted in hymns, fiddle tunes and the rock-ribbed symmetry of old-time country songwriting, particularly that of the Carter family. The Carters' songs are grounded in an unswerving faith and a willingness to face inevitable loss and death. Ms. Harris carries Appalachian simplicity into less certain times when sorrow is guaranteed but redemption is not. ''We lift our prayer against the odds,'' she sang on Monday night, ''And fear the silence is the voice of God/And we cry Hallelujah.''</p>
        <p>She sang about desperate love, a lost child, an old man's death and a friend's shattered dreams, with lyrics that easily moved between personal detail and parable.</p>
        <p>The songs had the aphoristic concision of a seasoned songwriter: ''It was just another way for the heart to break/So she learned to bend.'' To fight pretension, Ms. Harris sang quietly. Her voice has never been pushy; it takes up the stoic clarity of mountain music, adding a girlish sweetness. Now she often subdues it to a whisper, or lets a pure note turn frayed and weary.</p>
        <p>Behind the air of fragility is the serene confidence of a singer who knows the power of reticence to draw a listener closer. Ms. Harris's voice inhabits her songs like a wraith, intangible but omnipresent.</p>
        <p>While the tunes seem classic, the music placed them in a modern wilderness. Brady Blade on drums and Tony Hall on bass set up marchlike cadences, while Buddy Miller played tolling guitar chords that hung in the air. The music had undercurrents of country shuffles and slow-rolling soul music. There were also broad, deliberate spaces in the arrangements that were as resonant as a cathedral ceiling.</p>
        <p>To vary the mood, Ms. Harris also had a few mountain gospel songs, with vocal harmony from the band, and uptempo songs like Rodney Crowell's ''I Ain't Livin' Long Like This,'' which gave Mr. Miller a chance to show off some speed-fingered rockabilly and bluegrass lines.</p>
        <p>But for most of the concert Ms. Harris kept the audience rapt with music that was hushed and vulnerable, longing to be reverent. In songs about lonely journeys and lost companions Ms. Harris has found herself.</p>
