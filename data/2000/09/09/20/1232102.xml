        <p>The world of network television is increasingly about creating events, and ABC, with its plan for ''Gideon's Crossing,'' a medical drama, has found a way to make one of its new shows stand out.</p>
        <p>As it announced last week, the network plans to present the premiere of the show on Oct. 10 without commercial interruption. Aside from a one-minute commercial at the start of the show and another at the end, the show will run for 57 minutes.</p>
        <p>The sole sponsor will be the Johnson &amp; Johnson Company, which agreed to the approach, said Andrea Alstrup, its vice president for advertising, because it was so impressed with the quality of the show and because the medical connection seemed, she said, ''such a good fit for us.''</p>
        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson plans to advertise separate pharmaceutical products in its two commercials. ''Gideon's Crossing'' stars Andre Braugher as a crusading doctor in a teaching hospital who takes on what appear to be hopeless cases. Critics have identified it as one of the most promising new dramas of the season.</p>
        <p>ABC clearly hopes that the premiere will help establish the series as one of the hits of the new season. ''Making it an event is the whole idea,'' said Alex Wallau, the president of ABC. It had better be, because Mr. Wallau conceded that ABC was not making nearly as much in advertising as it would with a normal roster of commercials.</p>
        <p>Without mentioning a specific figure, Mr. Wallau said, ''This is seven figures less than the normal price we'd get.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallau, who came up with the idea for the commercial-less premiere, said that as far as ABC could determine it was a first for a regular television series. Three years ago NBC broadcast the film ''Schindler's List'' without commercial interruption after the Ford Motor Company signed on as the sponsor that would bracket the film with commercials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallau said that ABC's task was harder because the premiere  had already been assigned ''many million dollars of advertising.'' The problem, he said, was not that ABC felt that interrupting certain content would be in bad taste so much as that the network did not want to cut that much of the episode.</p>
        <p>''The pilot came in at 65 minutes long,'' Mr. Wallau said. ''We felt we'd be butchering the show to squeeze it down to less than 50 minutes to fit in the commercials.'' ABC could have tried to extend the show to 90 minutes, but Mr. Wallau said that would have meant cutting back another ABC show during premiere week, which the network was loath to do.</p>
        <p>So ''Gideon's Crossing'' will run as though it were on HBO: no breaks, not even for promotions of other ABC series.</p>
        <p>Ms. Alstrup has also been a leader of the Family Friendly Programming Forum, which has urged the networks to offer more family-oriented programming early in the evening. She said that by backing ''Gideon's Crossing,'' she wanted to advocate ''quality programming of every kind.''</p>
        <p>But h she and Mr. Wallau said that the move could hardly be seen as a precedent. ''It could only work for unique situations,'' Ms. Alstrup said. ''I don't think it would be affordable on any other basis.''</p>
        <p>'Confessions' Gone</p>
        <p>The hotly debated Court TV series ''Confessions'' lasted all of two episodes as the cable channel responded this week to outrage over the use of taped confessions of murderers as entertainment programming by announcing that it was canceling the series. The move came after many  protest calls, including some from the families of victims of those featured in the confessions.</p>
        <p>The ratings were no better or worse than those the show usually receives, a Court TV spokeswoman, Betsy Vorce, said yesterday. But she said, ''The show offended a wide range of people.''</p>
        <p>''Confessions,'' which ran Sunday nights at 10, will be replaced this week, but as of yesterday there had been no decision on a replacement.</p>
        <p>2 on the Impeachment</p>
        <p>On the heels of the announcement by HBO that it would present a mini-series devoted to the impeachment of President Clinton, based on Jeffrey Toobin's book ''A Vast Conspiracy,'' Columbia TriStar Television has acquired the rights to the book ''The Breach,'' by Peter Baker, a reporter for The Washington Post. The book is published by Scribner.</p>
        <p>The book, which is being excerpted this week in The Post, covers the impeachment from inside the congressional process. Based on current support for the NBC series ''The West Wing,'' Helen Verno, the head of movies and miniseries for the Columbia television studio, saw the opportunity to do an inside-Washington process story.</p>
        <p>Columbia began offering the project to the networks as either a film or miniseries starting yesterday.</p>
        <p>The HBO film, meanwhile, is to cover the impeachment story more from the president's point of view as reflected in the Toobin book, whose title is taken from Hillary Clinton's denunciation of the effort to remove the president as a ''vast right-wing conspiracy.''</p>
        <p>'Survivor' Falters</p>
        <p>CBS's decision to bring back ''Survivor'' as counterprogramming to the Olympics has not had nearly the impact the network had hoped for.</p>
        <p>Repeats of the series clearly do not carry the same degree of fascination that the first run did -- or even a fraction thereof.</p>
        <p>On Monday night the show drew the lowest rating on CBS for the night, less than a 5 rating for the hour. (Each rating point represents just over 1 million homes.) It finished last among shows running from 9 to 10. The network had hoped that some of the viewers who tuned in to see the later episodes might come back to see the early ones they had missed. But that has not proved to be the case.</p>
