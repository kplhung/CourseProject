        <p>E. B. White, that great chronicler of life in New York, once said of the city's mood-altering powers, ''You always feel that either by shifting your location 10 blocks or by reducing your fortune by $5 you can experience rejuvenation.'' White probably wasn't thinking of models whisking themselves down a catwalk, but the line rings true for fashion, too.</p>
        <p>Shift the action from the tents in Bryant Park, where Oscar de la Renta presented a girly spring collection before a familiar society crowd on Tuesday, to a street corner in Greenwich Village, where Marc Jacobs played to a front row of hip celebrities and aging rockers on Monday night, and you instantly get a different picture of fashion and New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. de la Renta, having spent some years in Paris and lived a little as well, must know that there is a club in that city named after him, Oscar de la Disco. Certainly, there were moments in his up-and-down show when one wondered if, by proposing tangerine spangled pants and enormous bubble skirts, he wasn't suggesting to his well-heeled customers that they roll back the good Aubussons and hold Watusi parties.</p>
        <p>This side of Mr. de la Renta, admittedly the fun side of a man who has probably never shirked a dance partner, took over the collection, sending it veering from a shredded organza pouf dress (a thank you to Karl Lagerfeld) to a lovely, almost pared-down version of the Madame X dress of the Sargent portrait. Mr. de la Renta evidently picked up the girly vibe rumbling through fashion, but it's not his style, and when a model came out wearing a clingy black sweater with what looked like a pink satin inner tube blown up around her hips, you had to wonder if it was something concocted at the last minute. Just to compete.</p>
        <p>He fared much better with day clothes, particularly beaded sweaters in powder blue or melon over crystal pleated skirts, and some snappy mackintoshes in mellow candy stripes over short skirts. He can do short and sexy, all right, but it has to look as natural as Carmen Kass swinging out in her Baby Jane Holzer bouffant in a navy cashmere polo over flirty tennis skirt.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Jacobs, his shows are so loaded with references to fashion's fabulous past that it sometimes seems as if he is administering a pop quiz, and that if you don't get the answer right -- indeed, if you don't get it period -- you will be sent to the corner with a dunce cap. Except it will say ''geek.''</p>
        <p>Given the arbitrary power that designers have to change their style each season, it shouldn't come as a surprise that Mr. Jacobs abandoned the classic suits and town coats he showed for fall, with their boxy shapes and neat luggage trims, which evoked an era in New York when young women, perhaps down from Vassar or Smith, still dressed up. In a tented playground on Monday night, the image that Mr. Jacobs's chaotic spring clothes conjured up was completely different -- Madonna in her wild-child, CBGB period or maybe ''Valley Girl,'' the 1983 movie, seen through the eyes of a designer who now spends most of his time in Paris.</p>
        <p>This meant deliberate clashes of color, but loud, campy colors like aqua and pink or yellow and royal blue. Mr. Jacobs opened with slinky T-shirts in cotton jersey that slipped off a shoulder or were crunched in folds at the elbow, and were a little like the style of Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga, but looser, more disco. These, and bustiers, were generally shown with cotton skirts that flared away from the hips or fell in tiers of ruffles to the knee. It's hard to remember when Mr. Jacobs last showed a piece of jewelry, but pinned on many of the clothes -- peplum jackets and taffeta knicker suits -- were plastic brooches flocked with rhinestones. And there were hair clips with tulle rosettes and more ornaments on the vividly colored stilettos.</p>
        <p>If you're a follower of fashion, if you consider yourself reasonably astute and not too slow or shabby, you are probably at this moment choking on one word: ''peplum.'' You are wondering, What gives? And the answer is wrapped in the camp style of a fashion that is constantly being revived. Many of Mr. Jacobs's new clothes are cute and adorable, and one can imagine hordes of young women, who gag on the word ''ladylike,'' trampling toward the Village next spring in girly skirts and drooping T-shirts in lurid candy-color hues.</p>
        <p>But the trouble with revivalism in an era of instant Internet recall is that it's harder now to get the distance one needs to view a former style ironically. Thirty years ago, Yves Saint Laurent could shock timid souls, as he did when he presented his landmark 1940's-inspired haute couture collection, a show that sent the columnist Eugenia Sheppard running to the teletype machine, or wherever editors ran to in those days, to declare that the clothes were ''truly hideous.''</p>
        <p>It was one of the few times in Ms. Sheppard's career when she did not get it. Mr. Saint Laurent's clothes were, in fact, pure camp, but he had the advantage of distance and the meandering pace of change. Outrage was still possible.</p>
        <p>Yeohlee Teng put on a good show in the tents yesterday, displaying a much lighter hand than she did last season. She opened with fluid sarong skirts and cotton tank tops and advanced to some sweet sundresses in a white grid-pattern eyelet or a brown and maroon tattersall check. The clothes had a slight vintage feel, with seersucker and cotton pique and a little knit shirt bursting with tropical flowers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs returned to the stage yesterday with his new, lower-priced Marc line, which seemed to be designed for people with the attention span of puppies. But it was cute and tauntingly slutty, with the models stepping out in glitter hot pants, striped cotton playsuits with woven rainbow belts and anklets, and one blue ruched jumpsuit with slightly kinky overtones.</p>
