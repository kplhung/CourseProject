        <p>Mike Petke knew it could be this way. Petke, a defender for the MetroStars, last year felt the sting of seeing his team viewed as Major League Soccer's No. 1 embarrassment. Now, as the MetroStars stand a victory from reaching the league's playoff semifinals, Petke can especially savor the difference.</p>
        <p>''The attitude we've had this year is a 180-degree turn from the previous years,'' Petke said as the MetroStars prepared to meet the Dallas Burn in Game 2 on Wednesday night in the Cotton Bowl, ahead by a victory.</p>
        <p>''People came in focused,'' Petke, a third-year pro, said. ''This is the first year since I've been here that we haven't dwelled on the year before. And that attitude has carried over to this day.''</p>
        <p>The MetroStars' 1999 season seemed particularly onerous: a 7-25 record that included a league-record 12-match losing streak.</p>
        <p>''Think of the lowest, saddest word and that is an understatement of how bad it was,'' said Petke, a first-round pick out of Southern Connecticut State in the 1998 college draft. ''Really, we could have been such a good team. But when things started to go bad, the attitude that came from the coaching staff wasn't a good one.</p>
        <p>''When we were in that long losing streak, certain members of the coaching staff said: 'Oh, this is life. This is the way things go.' That's baloney. That's not the way life goes. It's the way life goes only if we let it be like that. And we did. We had no sense of winning. No pride, really.''</p>
        <p>In came new leadership, Octavio Zambrano as coach, Nick Sakiewicz as general manager. The team quickly established a new tone, Petke said, and it finished 17-12-3, first in the Eastern Division.</p>
        <p>''They laid the foundation,'' Zambrano said. ''I think it was a matter of them seeing who would follow it and who wouldn't. There were changes made, and I think the guys who are on the field now are the ones who followed it.''</p>
        <p>Zambrano sat each player down, offered a critique of his ability and told him what would be expected. Petke received an ultimatum of sorts. ''He told me: 'I like the way you play. You're really a good player. But if you don't perform the way I want, you're gone. I'll trade you,' '' Petke said. ''I liked that, because it helped me know where I stood.''</p>
        <p>Petke's height -- 6 feet 2 inches -- and bleached blond hair make him highly visible on the MetroStars' defense, but so does his play. Against the Burn he will again be shadowing forward Ariel Graziani, the leading scorer for Dallas with 15 goals in 24 games.</p>
        <p>They are familiar combatants. Earlier this year the 24-year-old Petke studied extra film of Graziani and went in determined to shut him down. He did in that game in July, a 2-1 victory for the MetroStars, so much so that he felt Graziani resorting to kicking him instead of the ball in the game's second half and then threw a punch at him near game's end. They have met twice since -- also MetroStars victories -- without incident.</p>
        <p>As much of a striking turnaround as the MetroStars have performed, they remain no slam dunk to go deep into the playoffs. That is because they are playing with a recently promoted goalkeeper from their Long Island minor league affiliate, Paul Grafer, hoping he does not come unglued in the playoff pressure.</p>
        <p>With the regular goalkeeper, Mike Ammann, mending from several broken ribs, and the backup Tim Howard still playing for the United States Olympic team, Grafer held together nicely in the team's 2-1 overtime victory last Friday over the Burn.</p>
        <p>''We're still learning about him,'' Petke said. ''There are certain plays where I might let the ball go by because I know Mike would come off the line and get it. I'm not that sure if Paul is reading it the same way. That only comes with time.''</p>
