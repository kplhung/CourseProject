        <p>Anybody who has wondered why the world's biggest banks have been scrambling for a foothold on Wall Street need look no further than the Goldman Sachs Group's latest earnings report.</p>
        <p>Goldman, one of the biggest investment banks, reaped big gains from trading and from investing in private companies that more than offset a slowdown in stock and bond underwriting. Despite the slackening in the United States stock markets since the Nasdaq took a dive in April, Goldman and other securities firms have continued to reap extraordinary profits, especially from underwriting and advising on mergers in Europe.</p>
        <p>Goldman said yesterday that it earned $824 million, or $1.62 a diluted share, in its fiscal third quarter, which ended Aug. 31. That was 29 percent more than the $638 million, or $1.32, earned in the corresponding quarter of 1999 and 11 cents a share more than analysts had expected, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Net revenue rose 33 percent, to $4.53 billion, in the quarter.</p>
        <p>''On the heels of the Nasdaq meltdown, they had a very solid quarter,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Shares of Goldman, which slipped from their record high of $133 last week after the Chase Manhattan Corporation announced its plan to acquire J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, rose $1.38, to $119.94, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Investors were encouraged as much by Goldman's results as by comments from its chief financial officer, David Viniar, about the outlook for its business this quarter. Mr. Viniar said that Goldman had as big a backlog of underwriting and advisory assignments as it had ever had.</p>
        <p>''The Nasdaq being flat has not really affected the business,'' Mr. Viniar said. ''There's still lots of demand for people to issue equity; there's still lots of demand for advice on mergers.''</p>
        <p>Still, Goldman's revenue from investment banking dropped 17 percent from the second quarter as the number of new stock offerings declined. What really helped out last quarter was the demand from investors for shares in companies that Goldman had invested in before they went public.</p>
        <p>The firm recorded $480 million in gains on those private equity investments. About half of that was profit realized on the sale of shares in unidentified companies, Mr. Viniar said. The rest came from marking up the value of the firm's stakes in companies that had recently gone public, increases that reversed markdowns in the previous quarter.</p>
        <p>''Strong merchant banking results really carried the quarter,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company. He said Goldman's earnings would probably have declined from a year before without the increase from those investments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kraushaar said that other investment banks could also show big gains from private equity investments when they report earnings this week. Lehman Brothers Holdings is scheduled to report today and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Company is scheduled to report tomorrow.</p>
        <p>James K. Schmidt, who manages the John Hancock Financial Industries fund, said his fund owned shares of both of those firms and he expected both to report earnings that at least matched the consensus estimates of analysts. Lehman has repeatedly reported earnings far better than analysts expected, but Mr. Schmidt said he doubted that would happen again after the slow start to last quarter.</p>
        <p>He said he considered Lehman, and possibly the much bigger Merrill Lynch, as likely targets of the current wave of buyouts that includes the planned purchases of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette by the Credit Suisse Group and of the PaineWebber Group by UBS.</p>
        <p>Goldman said it earned 27 cents for every dollar of its shareholders' equity, an impressive return by Wall Street standards. Investment banking has been so profitable for so long that some investors have come to expect returns on equity well above the traditional target of 20 percent. But others have begun to worry that the industry's growth is slowing while some firms are still spending heavily to compete with the new breed of financial conglomerates.</p>
        <p>Most investment banks have been hiring aggressively and spending large sums to set up offices in London and other European capitals. Goldman said it had 18,666 employees at the end of last quarter, up almost 30 percent from the prior year. But Mr. Viniar emphasized that Goldman had held its spending on employee compensation and benefits to 50 percent of its net revenue, or revenue minus interest expense.</p>
        <p>''Firms are making bets on the potential for the business to continue to grow over the long term at very attractive rates,'' Mr. Moszkowski of Salomon Smith Barney said. ''If that's the wrong bet, firms will have high levels of fixed costs and low profits and they will have to lay people off.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Moszkowski said that the biggest firms believed they had no choice but to build up their competitive position in the most lucrative areas of investment banking, including advising on mergers and underwriting and trading stocks and high-yield bonds.</p>
        <p>''The history of the last 10 years has said that you can't be too timid or you lose market share,'' he said.</p>
