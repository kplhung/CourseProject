        <p>An administration plan to compensate private-sector workers who were made sick by exposure to hazardous chemicals or radiation while building nuclear weapons may fall victim to a jurisdictional dispute, administration officials say.</p>
        <p>A provision that would authorize compensation passed the Senate on a voice vote, as part of the Defense Authorization bill, but there was no similar provision in the House legislation, so the issue is now before a House-Senate committee.</p>
        <p>Agreement in the conference committee has been held up because the Senate bill calls for the program to be administered by the Labor Department, but members of the House Judiciary Committee want it channeled through a Justice Department office that also handles radiation claims against the government arising from nuclear weapons testing.</p>
        <p>The legislation would cover thousands of people who worked for private weapons contractors. Nearly all are ineligible for workers' compensation because their illnesses developed years or decades after exposure, the Energy Department said.  The department acknowledged earlier this year that hundreds of workers had a lung illness that could have been caused only by their work on nuclear weapons components.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department says the Senate version of the program would cost about $1.8 billion in the first five years, and less thereafter. It would provide each worker with reimbursement for lost wages or $200,000, whichever is larger, plus health care expenses. The Senate provision, though, is only an authorization, not an appropriation, leaving it to a future Congress to provide the money.</p>
        <p>The Judiciary Committee favors a package modeled after the one already on the books for uranium miners and people who were exposed to fallout for weapons tests, which offers $100,000 per victim. Among the issues before the conferees is why one group of victims should be compensated more generously than another. It plans hearings on Thursday, although the issue could be decided by conferees on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Seeking to win compensation, 104 members of the House, including many with victims in their districts, wrote to the conferees asking them to adopt the Senate version.</p>
        <p>Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, a Pennsylvania Democrat whose district includes a defunct plant where workers were exposed to beryllium and where some suffer a debilitating lung disease as a result, said he was ''cautiously optimistic'' that the Senate version would be approved.</p>
        <p>Robert Alvarez, a former Energy Department official who is now a consultant for a union representing some of the workers, said the House program amounted to an ''apology payment'' as opposed to reimbursement for losses, because it does not offer reimbursement for lost wages.</p>
        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson early this year became the first head of that agency to acknowledge that weapons manufacture had sickened or killed some of the 600,000 people who have worked in the plants.</p>
        <p>In a letter sent on Monday to Representative Floyd D. Spence, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, he said: ''The men and women who worked for the Department of Energy and served our nation in the nuclear weapons industries of World War II and the cold war labored under difficult and dangerous conditions with some of the most hazardous materials known to mankind. It is time for Congress to act to ensure that they get the help they have long deserved. These workers, many of whom are now seriously ill, should not have to wait to be compensated.''</p>
