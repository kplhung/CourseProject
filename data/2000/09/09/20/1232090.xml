        <p>Seven years ago, Kim Soo Nyung of South Korea decided to retire after a career as one of the great female archers, with three Olympic gold medals and one silver to her name. She was the queen of quivers in a country where a generation of archers dominated international competition.</p>

        <p>Seven years ago, Kim Soo Nyung of South Korea decided to retire after a career as one of the great female archers, with three Olympic gold medals and one silver to her name. She was the queen of quivers in a country where a generation of archers dominated international competition.</p>
        <p>At the time, a 10-year-old girl named Yun Mi Jin was taking up the sport in an elementary school just outside Seoul, joining because a friend did, never knowing or even dreaming that she would one day take Kim's place. But that's what happened today as a transition to a new era played out at the Olympic Archery Center.</p>
        <p>Kim, now 30, was back from retirement, a mother with two young children who decided that elite sports competition could be her profession. Today, though, she ran into Yun, now 17 and possessing the type of talent Kim had when she took the gold as a 17-year-old at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.</p>
        <p>Humble yet confident, Yun eliminated Kim in the semifinals, then coolly outdueled another Korean, Kim Nam Soon in the final to win the women's individual gold.</p>
        <p>It was a tense match for the gold medal. Each woman shot 12 arrows in the final, earning 10 points for a bull's-eye and fewer points, in descending order, the farther away the arrows landed from the center of the target. Jun led by a point, 80-79, after nine arrows. Kim Nam Soon applied the pressure, hitting for 9 points on three straight shots. But Jun answered with shots for 10 points, 8 points and 9 points, and prevailed by 107-106.</p>
        <p>''I didn't expect to win any medals,'' Jun said afterward. ''I put my fate in luck.''</p>
        <p>South Korea has dominated the sport since it was restored to the Games in 1972, winning eight golds, including the last five individual titles.</p>
        <p>Kim Soo Nyung beat Choe Ok Sil of North Korea for the bronze, and the two women hugged afterward in another small moment illustrative of the improving relations between athletes of the two nations. Last Friday, the athletes from the two Koreas marched together in the opening ceremonies, although not all the archers did so because some had to compete the next day. Jun said the idea of marching together made her feel ''as if two countries became one country,'' and that she hoped they would be competing together at the next Olympics.</p>
        <p>Jun seems destined for a long Olympic career. South Koreans consider qualifying for the Olympics the real test, because the domestic competition from Korean rivals is so great. Jun earned the honor with consistently high scoring throughout the year. As an 11th-grade student in Suwon, south of Seoul, she trains in the morning and does schoolwork in the afternoon. Slight and shy, she spoke softly but nevertheless talked of her confidence.</p>
        <p>It is the same type of confidence that propelled Kim Soo Nyung to Olympic champion, a title that Jun appears ready to hold onto with a strong, steady hand.</p>
