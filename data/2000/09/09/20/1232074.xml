        <p>WALKING the narrow line between culinary authenticity and popular appeal, Brad Kelley has always managed to keep his balance. His restaurants, Kin Khao, Kelley &amp; Ping, and Bop, each present an Asian cuisine in a seductive downtown environment, where unfamiliar foods are wrapped in a cushion of cocktails, sexy design or creature comforts. While he has won over young American crowds, the tradeoff has been toned-down food.</p>
        <p>His latest restaurant, Daily Chow, which opened just a few weeks ago, brings the Thai dishes of Kin Khao and Kelley &amp; Ping and the Korean dishes of Bop together with Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese preparations. Such variety would seem almost impossible for any one restaurant to master: it's the equivalent of specializing in European foods from Spain to Russia. But Daily Chow does enough things well and is so good-natured that a meal there can be thoroughly enjoyable.</p>

        <p>WALKING the narrow line between culinary authenticity and popular appeal, Brad Kelley has always managed to keep his balance. His restaurants, Kin Khao, Kelley &amp; Ping, and Bop, each present an Asian cuisine in a seductive downtown environment, where unfamiliar foods are wrapped in a cushion of cocktails, sexy design or creature comforts. While he has won over young American crowds, the tradeoff has been toned-down food.</p>
        <p>His latest restaurant, Daily Chow, which opened just a few weeks ago, brings the Thai dishes of Kin Khao and Kelley &amp; Ping and the Korean dishes of Bop together with Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese preparations. Such variety would seem almost impossible for any one restaurant to master: it's the equivalent of specializing in European foods from Spain to Russia. But Daily Chow does enough things well and is so good-natured that a meal there can be thoroughly enjoyable.</p>
        <p>The spare two-level design manages to be simple and good-looking. The walls are painted in warm colors, while a sense of Asia is conveyed quietly through bamboo light fixtures and a tall light sculpture joining the two floors that looks like a luminous abacus. The bar and smoking area are on the darker second floor; the ground level is quieter.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece on the ground floor is a sort of salad bar used for the so-called Mongolian barbecue section of the menu. You fill a bowl with vegetables and noodles, select shrimp, chicken or beef and a sauce ($8.50), and hand it to a cook for stir-frying. The result is a prefabricated dish with little flavor that is far easier to imagine at a health-food restaurant than in Mongolia.</p>
        <p>Preferable alternatives include Chinese scallion pancakes ($5.75), crisp and savory, served with a soy dipping sauce, and Chinese shrimp with salt-and-pepper crust ($7.50), so delicate you can eat the briny shell. Two Thai soups ($4.50), tom yum gung with shrimp and lemon grass, and gai tom kha with chicken and coconut milk, are excellent, while a Japanese soy broth with soba noodles and tempura ($8.95) is simultaneously delicate and hearty.</p>
        <p>But Daily Chow falls short with wrapped and stuffed dishes, whether Chinese shrimp dumplings ($5.95) or Vietnamese ravioli ($5.50) and summer rolls ($5.95). Flavors are insipid, the wrappings thick and clumsy.</p>
        <p>The food can certainly seem secondary. Daily Chow focuses on a drinking crowd, offering pitchers of cocktails ($30) with names like ginger kamikaze and Thai dye that seem to invite oblivion, though there is a small but well-chosen list of wines ($28 to $35 a bottle).</p>
        <p>Of the main courses, the Korean dishes are most successful. Bulgogi ($12.95), tender, flavorful shreds of beef, comes with spicy kimchi, while bibimbop ($14.95), the famous rice, beef and egg dish, is served with vegetables in a hot stone crock so that the bottom layer turns crisp. Pork chops ($14.25) are thin as blades, Vietnamese style, delicious in their marinade of soy, cilantro and lemon grass.</p>
        <p>But some of the Thai dishes are marred by a lack of spicing. Nua kaprow ($12.95), sauteed beef with onions and basil, for example, is a delightful blend, with the anise flavor of the basil amplifying the flavor of the beef, but it needs at least a nudge of chili to bring it all together. Similarly, gung gratiem ($14.50), shrimp sauteed with garlic and onions, lacks a spicy dimension. Dishes where spicing isn't expected, like beef massaman curry ($12.95), which is often slightly sweet from coconut milk and tamarind juice, fare better.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite dishes is a dessert, mango sticky rice ($5.50), sweetened with coconut milk and served with mango slices; it is surprisingly authentic. A ginger-flavored brownie with coconut ice cream is about as Asian as a Big Mac, but delicious nonetheless.</p>
        <p>With Daily Chow, the winning atmosphere and enough good dishes help to make tolerable the timid spicing. Mr. Kelley is still walking that fine line, and he hasn't fallen yet.</p>
