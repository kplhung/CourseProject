        <p>Nasdaq Increases Sharply In a Technology Rebound  Technology stocks, under pressure for much of September, moved sharply higher, driving the Nasdaq composite index to its biggest one-day gain in more than three months.

        <p>The Nasdaq composite index gained 139.12 points, or 3.7 percent, to 3,865.64. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.39 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,459.90, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.23 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,789.29. [Page C10.]</p>

        <p>More Deaths Are Cited in Tire Case  Federal regulators said that since Aug. 31 they had received complaints of 15 more deaths attributed to Firestone tires on sport utility vehicles and pickups, raising to 103 the number of deaths under review.

        <p>Sun to Buy Web Appliance Maker  Sun Microsystems said that it had agreed to acquire Cobalt Networks, which produces Web appliances, in a stock swap valued at $2 billion. Acquiring Cobalt lets Sun address a fast-growing portion of the market that could not be reached readily with its own typically more expensive and more complex products. Shares of Sun gained $2.44, to $117.69, while Cobalt increased $16.06, or nearly 40 percent, to $57.19. [C9.]</p>

        <p>Concessions Made for Joint Venture  Time Warner and EMI Group proposed what they called ''substantial'' concessions that might include selling some of their record labels in an effort to keep European regulators from blocking their plan to merge their music businesses into a joint venture.

        <p>Japan Prepares Spending Package  Japan is preparing another package of supplemental spending aimed at propping up the economy, which has failed to gain enough momentum on its own despite several previous injections of money. [C4.]</p>
        <p>American Works the Puzzle of China  Being the general manager of Xerox's operations in China has required Howard Holley to make adjustments in the way he does business. But the business challenges are no greater than other puzzles he has faced there. Shanghai consistently exceeds expectations, he says. It's a city of dichotomies -- the extremes of China all rolled into one. He relishes the challenge. The Boss. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Death on Plane Ruled a Homicide  A passenger who tried to break into the cockpit during a Southwest Airlines flight was killed by passengers who restrained him, and not by a heart attack, as had been reported. A medical examiner ruled the death a homicide, but the authorities decided that there was no evidence of criminal intent and declined to bring charges. Joe Sharkey: Business Travel. [C5.]</p>
        <p>Price of E-Book Device Set at $300  Thomson Multimedia has priced its hand-held devices for reading electronic books. At about $300, they are unlikely to speed the adoption of e-books by the mass market. [C5.]</p>
