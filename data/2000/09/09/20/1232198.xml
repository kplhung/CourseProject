        <p>Four days into the coverage of the Olympics from Sydney, Australia, NBC is posting ratings that are by far the worst in television history for the event.</p>
        <p>Even more ominous for NBC is what might happen to future advertising sales for the Olympics. The network, which paid $705 million for the rights to the Sydney Games, has already committed more than $3 billion more to the next five Summer and Winter Olympics. NBC, which sold $900 million in advertising, will now have to sell those Games based on the lower ratings from Sydney.</p>
        <p>Right now, the only thing NBC seems to be attracting in abundance is reasons why the Games are so uncompelling for American viewers.</p>
        <p>Among the reasons cited, from television executives to viewers, is the schedule, which set this Olympics in late September, when the network is forced to face sports events like National Football League games and pennant-race games in baseball, all on nights when school is in session.</p>
        <p>There is also the time difference, which leads NBC to delay broadcasting all events until many hours after they actually happen. And a flood of information about the Games is available all day on the Internet and on sports cable channels and sports talk radio stations, some of which did not exist four and eight years ago.</p>
        <p>Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, said: ''More than anything else, the problem is this is the first Olympics where viewers who didn't want to know the results -- and 80 percent don't want to know -- can't avoid them. This is the also the first time that our competitors did not have an incentive to go easy on us because the bidding is locked out for the next five Olympics.''</p>
        <p>Another reason for the low ratings is a lack of exposure that comes with the disappearance of regular, off-year coverage of many Olympic sports from network sports programs like ABC's ''Wide World of Sports.'' Some former Olympic producers even cited the end of the cold war and the us-versus-them feelings that prevailed in the Olympics when the Soviet Union faced off against the United States.</p>
        <p>NBC, looking for answers itself, is citing the subpar performances by members of the American gymnastics teams, which failed to win any medals.</p>
        <p>But neither team was considered a realistic medal contender going into the Games, and Olympics in the past have done far better when American teams did not even qualify for the medal rounds in gymnastics.</p>
        <p>In Seoul, South Korea, for example, in 1988, American gymnasts were no factor in the medals and yet NBC averaged a 16.4 rating for the first four nights, 13 percent higher than this year's number, which fell to a 14.3 average through Monday night. (Each rating point represents a bit more than a million homes.)</p>
        <p>NBC had announced publicly that it was hoping to average a 17.5 rating for the entire run of the Games, the same number it achieved in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain. No one at NBC ever believed the network would be able to approach the 21.5 rating NBC hit during the Atlanta Olympics four years ago because those Games were held on United States soil.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Iger, president of the Walt Disney Company, who for years played a role in ABC's coverage of Olympics, said he had one overall theory: ''For whatever reason, this Olympics had zero buzz. There was just no buzz at all. And four days in you still don't hear people talking about them.''</p>
        <p>One viewer, Gary Meltzer, a junior high school teacher from Flushing, N.Y., said: ''I go to the Internet and find out what's going on. To watch heats when you know who won the finals, it's absurd.''</p>
        <p>The numbers are surely troubling for NBC. Monday's rating, which the network had pointed to as one of its key nights because of the men's team gymnastics event, fell to only a 13.8. The Olympics barely beat ABC's ''Monday Night Football'' for the night, which had a 13.2 rating. (The Olympics had a 14.9 in the hours when they went head to head.)</p>
        <p>Again, during the Seoul Games, the Olympics proved far more potent against football, beating the two games on Monday nights by 4 rating points one week and 6 the next.</p>
        <p>Unless the ratings undergo an unprecedented revival, it is extremely unlikely that NBC will be able to reach the rating the network guaranteed to advertisers, a 16.1. NBC may be forced to give advertisers free commercials in the second week of the Games, though the network said it had built in enough extra time for advertisers that it did not face the prospect of a glut of commercials the second week.</p>
        <p>NBC is also arguing that it is attracting more than 100 million viewers to some portions of the coverage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Iger said he sympathized with NBC's problems, especially in trying to attract young viewers who today are being offered endless choices for entertainment, from computer chat rooms to video games to hundreds of cable channels. It has made marketing the Olympics much harder than ever before, he said.</p>
        <p>''And it doesn't help that the kids are back in school,'' he said.</p>
        <p>NBC could not control the scheduling because to stage them in the traditional months of July and August would have put them in the middle of the Australian winter.</p>
        <p>So the Olympics cannot avoid the N.F.L. On Monday night, local fans of the two teams involved let no doubt of their preferences.</p>
        <p>With the Cowboys playing the Redskins, the game drew a 35.8 rating in Dallas and a 33.3 rating in Washington. The Olympic numbers for the same cities: 16.1 in Dallas and 11.8 in Washington.</p>
        <p>The Games also took a beating Monday night in Atlanta, getting a 12.5 rating. That was good enough to nose out ''Monday Night Football'' but not good enough to beat the Mets-Braves game, which was on WTBS in Atlanta and scored a 13 rating.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meltzer, the viewer from Flushing had a similar rooting interest. He said he and his son Max, 10, did not watch the Olympics at all Monday. ''We watched the Mets game,'' he said. ''That certainly meant more to us.''</p>
        <p>Many sports and television executives blamed the long delays between the results, which are now widely reported on every news media outlet and the Internet, and the coverage. ''Even the morning papers are giving results,'' said Barry Frank, the senior group vice president of the International Management Group, and a longtime negotiator of television rights for the Olympics. ''We know what's happening. The United States is a country of winners, and we don't necessarily want to tune in when the United States isn't winning.''</p>
        <p>But through five days of competition, the United States was winning, more than any other country, in terms of both total medals and gold medals.</p>
        <p>And NBC has repeatedly argued that the network does not broadcast the Games for the hard-core sports fan but for casual fans, especially women.</p>
        <p>Susan McAfee of Fort Salonga, N.Y., said she is indeed enjoying the coverage. ''I love all the sports,'' she said. ''It's not quite the same, knowing the outcome, but I still appreciate and enjoy the athleticism.''</p>
        <p>What may be most absent, at least for viewers who have been caught up in the Games before, is one standout athlete or a compelling ongoing story line of the kind the Olympics have seen before, from athletes as varied as Olga Korbut to Dan Jansen.</p>
        <p>The network hopes that track and field will offer new possibilities, especially in the figure of Marion Jones, the American star who could win as many as five gold medals. But track does not have the immense female following of gymnastics, and football and baseball games will still beckon next week.</p>
