        <p>On the first day of training camp, Rangers Coach Ron Low challenged his players to go out and win a job. Last night, Low was still waiting.</p>
        <p>''I want somebody to step up and say, 'Play me,' '' Low said before the Rangers rallied for a 4-3 preseason victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at Madison Square Garden. ''So far, nobody's done it. And I'm talking about everybody.''</p>
        <p>Today, Low will have a chance to take a look at a new player because Mike Mottau, the Hobey Baker award winner from Boston College, agreed yesterday to join the team, even though he remains unsigned.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to come down and show the coaching staff what I could do,'' the defenseman said late last night after flying to New York from Boston. ''Hopefully, I'll play well and make the squad. It's completely up to me and how I play.''</p>
        <p>Glen Sather, the Rangers' president and general manager, said: ''It was a smart choice on his part. It gives him the opportunity. I've never seen anybody make a hockey team by sitting at home.''</p>
        <p>Both Mottau and Don Maloney, the Rangers' assistant general manager, indicated both sides were close to agreeing to a two-year deal in which Mottau would receive a signing bonus believed to be worth approximately $550,000. Mottau met Sather last night and said that the Rangers had given him until Oct. 4, three days before the season opener, to prove he deserves more money.</p>
        <p>''There's a deal on the table right now pretty similar to the one they offered me at the beginning with some simple revisions,'' Mottau said. ''It all depends on how I play. We'll see if anything can be done to sweeten the deal.''</p>
        <p>Last night, Mottau's agent, Bob Murray said: ''We've had some good discussions last night and today. We all felt it was in Mike's best interest to get into camp. It's a chance to show Ron and Glen what he can do.''</p>
        <p>Low indicated that Mottau had fallen behind two other young defensemen, Dale Purinton and Tomas Kloucek. Filip Novak has also impressed the Rangers.</p>
        <p>''But he's still a wild long shot to make the team,'' Low said of the 18-year-old defenseman.</p>
        <p>As for the young forwards, both Pavel Brendl and Jamie Lundmark struggled to find playing time last night in their first exhibition game, primarily because 28 penalties were called against both teams over the first two periods.</p>
        <p>''Brendl was about as cold as ice sitting on the bench,'' Low said when asked why he chose not to use Brendl on the power play. ''It almost seemed like it would be anti-productive.''</p>
        <p>Finally, in the third period, Lundmark flashed signs of the promise he showed at last year's camp.</p>
        <p>''He made a couple of plays that were N.H.L. plays,'' Low said. ''To be honest, I hadn't seen that all camp.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>MIKE YORK scored a short-handed goal with 3 minutes 4 seconds remaining to give the Rangers the victory. . . . Before the game, MARK MESSIER and his sister, MARY KAY MESSIER, announced the launching of a charitable program in association with BroadcastAmerica.com, for whom the Ranger captain will be a spokesman. The charity will benefit the Tomorrows Children's Fund through online auctions of Messier memorabilia.</p>
