        <p>Perhaps David Letterman put it best. After Vice President Al Gore appeared on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' last week, talking up his marriage and his family life to millions of female viewers, Mr. Letterman joked: ''Al, you go, girl!''</p>
        <p>The wisecrack neatly caught a dynamic of the last few weeks of the presidential campaign as first Mr. Gore and now Gov. George W. Bush have made aggressive efforts to secure the votes of women.</p>
        <p>From Mr. Gore's appeals to ''waitress moms'' to Mr. Bush's hourlong appearance today on Ms. Winfrey's show, women are central to the strategies of each campaign. Over all, Mr. Gore seems to have the edge; he now holds an 11-point lead among them in the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, while Mr. Bush leads among men.</p>
        <p>But not all women are signing on to the Gore campaign. While most single women support Mr. Gore, most married women, particularly those under 50 with children still at home, support Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''The marriage gap is even more dramatic than the gender gap,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has specialized in tracking women voters.</p>
        <p>This gap has been evident over the last few presidential elections, with married voters preferring the Republican, and unmarried voters preferring the Democrat. In 1996, President Clinton led Bob Dole among unmarried voters by 26 percentage points, according to polls of voters leaving polling places. Mr. Dole had a two-point advantage among married voters.</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, conducted Sept. 9 to 11 with 843 registered voters, shows a similar break.</p>
        <p>Married women prefer Mr. Bush over Mr. Gore, 45 percent to 37 percent, while unmarried women strongly prefer Mr. Gore to Mr. Bush, 57 percent to 22 percent.</p>
        <p>One difficulty in exploiting the marriage gap is that it is hard for candidates at this stage of a general election to refine their messages narrowly enough to reach one group or the other. And Mr. Gore, for one, wants to reach both. In Las Vegas on Monday he held two events focused on women's health care.</p>
        <p>''I'm for tough new patients' rights legislation to make sure women get the best health care, not the cheapest,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>While saying that all women with breast cancer should be able to have second opinions and coverage for mastectomies, he also addressed the needs of married women, saying that parents should be able to take their children to the nearest emergency room and that women should be able to choose an obstetrician as their primary-care physician.</p>
        <p>But because he has such an overwhelming advantage among single women, he can focus on married women, and he typically talks about families and parental involvement in a range of activities, from schools to putting V-chips in televisions to guard what children watch.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the strides that Mr. Gore has made, Mr. Bush has been aggressively trying to win back the support of many women. On Monday he and his wife, Laura, visited a maternity ward in Little Rock, Ark., and today Mr. Bush appeared with Ms. Winfrey before her millions of female viewers.</p>
        <p>There is no question that unmarried women over 50 form one of Mr. Gore's strongest groups of supporters and that he is struggling to win over married women. Mr. Bush is aiming squarely at the married group too, with his reignited campaign devoted to education.</p>
        <p>A new survey for the Pew Research Center, conducted Aug. 24 to Sept. 10 with 1,999 registered voters, shows how broad the disparity is. The poll shows that Mr. Bush is ahead among both married mothers and married fathers and among married men who have no children, but that Mr. Gore leads among most other sex-based categories, including unmarried men of all ages, which is a significant gain for him. (The New York Times/CBS News poll, however, has Mr. Bush two percentage points ahead among unmarried men and six points ahead among all men.)</p>
        <p>The candidates are tied among married men over 50, according to the Pew poll.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is less interested in them than Mr. Bush is, because they form the natural Republican base -- favoring tax cuts, the death penalty and building up the military, and opposing gun control.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush is to recapture his overall lead, he needs to expand his hold over the married mothers while rebuilding his base among men who are shifting toward Mr. Gore. These are white men who make less than $50,000 a year and have not attended college -- a signal group of social conservatives who have proved to be important swing voters in recent presidential elections.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the focus has been to reclaim the family for Democrats and Al Gore,'' Stanley Greenberg, Mr. Gore's pollster, said.</p>
        <p>Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew poll, found strong differences in the views of married mothers under 50 and those of women under 50, unmarried or married without children. The married mothers said they liked Mr. Bush better and considered him a stronger leader than Mr. Gore. They said Mr. Bush seemed more honest and more likely to get things done.</p>
        <p>But on all of these issues, unmarried women of all ages think more highly of Mr. Gore than married women do.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg says the explanation lies partly in differing economic circumstances. ''People who are in two-parent households have more money and more ability to deal with the ups and downs of life,'' he said. ''People who are single are more vulnerable to changes in the economy and are more in need of government services.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohut also foresees Mr. Gore benefiting from an underlying sense of anxiety that voters, especially women, have about their personal financial situations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lake agreed. She said unmarried women were ''much, much more likely'' to want government to provide a social safety net than married women were. Married women, she said, tend to be ''more values-oriented.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's emphasis on being a ''compassionate conservative'' and caring about education spoke to married women, Ms. Lake said, while his toughness on the military and on crime -- and the continuing executions of condemned prisoners in Texas -- have helped him keep the support of men.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, the goal is obvious. ''Younger, blue-collar men are more receptive to his message than college-educated men are,'' Ms. Lake said. Men who are both educated and affluent tend to support Mr. Bush because they like his tax cut proposal, his antigovernment stance and his support for privatizing part of Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg said Democrats had ceded the family vote to Republicans for years until President Clinton, a former client of the pollster, aimed many of his proposals at parental responsibilities, from improving family leave to protecting children from the hazards of the Internet.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Clinton's impeachment, the Democrats lost the ground they had gained, Mr. Greenberg said. Several analysts said Mr. Clinton's personal behavior was perhaps one of the strongest factors in inhibiting voters' support for Mr. Gore, particularly among women and even more so among married women with children at home.</p>
        <p>But analysts have identified a string of recent events that have swung women to Mr. Gore, starting with his selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running mate on Aug. 7 and including what Mr. Gore called his ''overwhelming surge of emotion'' when he kissed his wife at the convention.</p>
