        <p>Officials of the Brooklyn Museum of Art unveiled a $55 million plan yesterday to transform the institution's front entrance into a major civic plaza, with tiered seating, reflecting pools and programmable fountains flanking a modernistic new lobby of glass and steel.</p>
        <p>At a hearing before the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, the museum's director, Arnold Lehman, said the proposal would change ''a bleak and unwelcoming'' entrance into ''Brooklyn's new front stoop'' -- a space, he said, that would attract growing numbers of tourists and Brooklynites alike.</p>
        <p>Although several preservationists raised objections to the proposal, the museum's architect, James Stewart Polshek, said that his design would bring appeal, accessibility and pizzazz to an imposing Beaux-Arts facade.</p>
        <p>The museum -- a McKim, Mead &amp; White design built more than a century ago on Eastern Parkway -- once had a grand staircase rising some 28 feet from street level to the front entrance. But the deteriorating stairs were removed in 1935, leaving behind what Mr. Polshek called ''a kind of wasteland.''</p>
        <p>In years past, some museum officials talked of simply replacing the stairs, a notion favored by some preservationists, but Mr. Polshek told the commission yesterday that such an idea was impractical. ''People don't walk up 28 feet,'' he said. ''Twenty feet maybe.''</p>
        <p>The commission took no action yesterday on the proposal. ''We'll need to take some time to absorb it,'' said Jennifer J. Raab, the chairwoman. The commission, she said, will hold another hearing on the proposal in October, and she invited all interested parties to weigh in.</p>
        <p>If the commission approves the proposal, construction could begin next year and be finished by the end of 2002, museum officials said. The $55 million cost includes security system improvements, new parking areas, upgraded air-conditioning, new toilets and the restoration of the building's facade.</p>
        <p>Most of the money -- some $42.5 million -- would come from city taxpayers. The Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, has committed $20.5 million and the City Council has agreed to spend $16.5 million. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who last year cut off financing to the museum because of the contemporary-art exhibition ''Sensation,'' which he found offensive, settled a subsequent First Amendment lawsuit by promising, among other things, to commit $5.8 million to the project.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's hearing, several Brooklyn politicians expressed enthusiastic support for the plan, as did Community Board 9 and the leaders of several Brooklyn institutions, including the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens and the Brooklyn Children's Museum.</p>
        <p>There was also support from the New York Landmarks Conservancy. ''In our view, their architects have sent a wake-up call that is both appropriate and invigorating,'' said Roger Lang, a member of the group, adding, ''To be sure, this solution is not our grandfather's Beaux-Arts.''</p>
        <p>But there was also sharp criticism. Christabel Gough, secretary of the Society for the Architecture of the City, said the plan discarded graceful restoration in favor of a flashy entrance more appropriate for a theme park.</p>
        <p>''The entire scheme,'' she said, ''represents failure in the governance of an institution which is making an unfortunate programmatic demand to put out front an expensive glass signifier of the newly minted fun fair that is supposed to be spinning the turnstiles inside.''</p>
        <p>W. Carlyle Morris, a Brooklyn resident long active in preservation issues, said that the combination of a Modernist entrance and a Classical building was ''a marriage that should not happen.'' He also questioned the cost and scale of the proposed entrance plaza. ''The Brooklyn Museum,'' he said, ''would be better advised to spend these millions on the inside of the building to expand real museum use than to add this unsympathetic and overwhelming entrance.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Polshek dismissed the criticisms of his design as the usual ''knee-jerk preservationist reaction.'' But similar concerns were raised by the Municipal Art Society of New York in a letter submitted to the Landmarks Preservation Commission.</p>
        <p>While supporting the overall concept as ''a very positive feature for the museum,'' the society expressed reservations about what its members saw as the distracting complexity of the terraces, balconies, ramps and stairs.</p>
        <p>''The design would benefit from simplification of these elements,'' the society said.</p>
