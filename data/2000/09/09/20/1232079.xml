        <p>''The Mukishi,'' which Batoto Yetu has taken to the New Victory Theater, must surely be one of the most heartwarming shows in town. The audience on Saturday afternoon clapped and sang with the performers without any sense of self-consciousness.</p>
        <p>The mythology of the Luba and Tshokwe tribes of Angola and the Congo speaks of the mukishi, a spirit that appears to a village in times of crisis. There were moments in Julio Leitao's choreography for ''The Mukishi'' when a community was threatened by ominous-looking performers who swept across the stage like fierce winds. Yet the villagers were clearly protected by benign powers and the production became a celebration of the glory of fine dancing. Mr. Leitao, who was born in Angola, uses the mukishi as a symbol of African indomitability.</p>
        <p>Batoto Yetu, his Harlem-based company, takes its name from words meaning ''our children'' in Swahili, and its exuberant but well-disciplined dancers are children ranging in age from 4 to 17. But Mr. Leitao manages to create a childlike spirit in the minds and hearts of both the young people and the grown-ups watching ''The Mukishi.'' Some of the performers taught songs to the audience. The troupe's musicians had percussive conversations with theatergoers by asking them to give clapping responses to proclamations made on the drums.</p>
        <p>Although ''The Mukishi'' is an attraction of this year's Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater, it has nothing to do with doll-like figures on sticks or strings. Rather, as designed by Garland S. Farwell, the emphasis is on brightly colored masks, parts of huge constructions that cover the upper body and make dancers resemble animals or spirits, some of them with snapping jaws and billowing manelike hair.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, for all their bulk, these constructions do not significantly impede movement. Masked and unmasked performers moved with remarkable agility in what was essentially a suite of varied African dances. Many sequences featured vigorous stamping with wide flings of the arms. At other times dancers took big strides forward or leaped lightly like gazelles.</p>
        <p>Contributing to the joy of ''The Mukishi'' was a percussion ensemble led by Roderick Jackson, the work's music director. Rattles whirred and chattered. Some drums solemnly rumbled and thundered. Others sounded more lighthearted and almost seemed to be laughing. And when the drums conversed with the audience, the audience was delighted to talk back by making percussive noises. The performers began and ended the show by dancing in the theater's center aisle. Many members of the audience might have felt tempted to join them.</p>
        <p>''The Mukishi'' continues through Sunday at the New Victory, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan.</p>
