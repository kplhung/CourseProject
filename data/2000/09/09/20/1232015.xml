        <p>WINSTON-Bella. On Sunday, September 17, we lost our center, our solace and our strength. Our mother's love sustained and comforted twenty-eight people; now the heart of a vast family is broken in ways that can not mend. At 72, our mother's soul was still trusting and sweet yet also wise and brave enough to withstand daily strife and terrible tragedy. Her death followed our father's by three short months, as if he could endure neither life nor death without her. We, her children, held a private funeral on Monday so that we might have a few last moments alone with her. Both our love and grief were too great to share.</p>
        <p>WINSTON-Bella. Dearest Nanny, we were your darlings and you made us happy. Your gentle scent, soothing smile and adoring touch has softened all of our lives. You believed in us, comforted us and also made sure we were never hungry. Words with you always came easily, as the joy you took in our lives made us feel special and secure. Our hearts ache without you. Jarret, Lizzie, Dustin, Ryan, Nicky, Rachael, Josh, Rebecca, Natasha, John, Bryce, Jaclyn, and Aaron.</p>
        <p>WINSTON-Bella. Beloved wife of Lionel A. Winston and treasured mother to Diane &amp; Jason Cohen, Debra and Marc Shore, David and Mindy Winston, Patricia &amp; Richard Marback, Claire and Marc Behar, Jonathan and Eve Winston, Robert and Kari Winston.</p>
