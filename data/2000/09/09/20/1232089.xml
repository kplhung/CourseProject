        <p>What do you do to stand out when you are the eighth American Olympic boxer to climb into the ring and the previous seven boxers from your team have not only won but won convincingly?</p>
        <p>If you're light middleweight Jermain Taylor you knock out your opponent at 1 minute 50 seconds of the first round with one straight right hand to the chin.</p>
        <p>''That makes it eight for eight,'' said Taylor after his striking victory over Bulgaria's Dimitriy Usagin today. ''Everybody knows we've got a streak going.''</p>
        <p>Taylor said he had a $5 bet with his middleweight teammate Jeff Lacy over who could knock out the most opponents. Lacy won his first-round fight Monday after just two rounds, although officially his fight was stopped because he had a commanding 15-point lead on the judges' scorecards.</p>
        <p>Taylor hit Usagin with a right hand that sent the Bulgarian toppling face first in the middle of the ring, a rare sight in amateur boxing where punches are blunted by headgear and referees protect fighters with regular stoppages if the action grows too intense.</p>
        <p>Later, Taylor said he had a message for Lacy, ''That's how you knock somebody out.''</p>
        <p>Usagin got up and stood on wobbling legs but the referee had already halted the fight. So officially, Taylor won't receive a knockout either; it was a referee's stoppage.</p>
        <p>''I guess we're still even on the bet then,'' said Taylor, another of the less heralded American fighters who impressively dominated his preliminary fight.</p>
        <p>The smiling United States coach, Tom Mustin, said, ''That's as close to a knockout as you can get in amateur boxing.''</p>
        <p>But when Mustin was told of the Taylor-Lacy bet, he looked less pleased.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know about that,'' he said. ''I've talked to Lacy about how you can't go for knockouts, just throw your punches and if they come they come. Now I'll have to tell Jermain the same thing.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, the American flyweight Jose Navarro weathered two close rounds with Indonesia's Hermensen Ballo before he pulled away to win a 16-10 decision. Navarro came out cautiously, as most of the Americans have, but was much more active in the third round when he outpointed Ballo, 7-1.</p>
        <p>''I guess I wasn't throwing enough punches,'' Navarro said. ''I might have been waiting to get more comfortable.''</p>
        <p>Lacy, a 22-year-old from Little Rock, Ark., also said he was working off the rust on his boxing style in his 117 seconds in the ring tonight.</p>
        <p>''I'll be better in my second-round fight,'' said Lacy, who was leading, 4-1, on the judges' cards when Usagin went down.</p>
        <p>Mustin was happy to leave the boxing site with his boxers undefeated after four sessions in Sydney.</p>
        <p>''Yup,'' he said walking from the ring, ''another good day.''</p>
