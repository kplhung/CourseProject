        <p>After listening to designers relay their contrived references season after season -- Julie Christie in ''Darling,'' Petula Clark in ''The Runaway Bus,'' Golda Meir meets ''Sabrina'' -- there's nothing quite as refreshing as handing the microphone over to Hussein Chalayan. A few days before he showed his spring 2001 line for Tse New York at the Roseland Ballroom on Monday, Mr. Chalayan offered these words: ''I don't refer to anything really, anything historical, anything about clothes from the 60's, anything at all. It's based on the idea of a circle, a square and a triangle.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the clothes flowing from the sewing machines of most young designers, Mr. Chalayan's never seem a result of a trip to a vintage-dress dealer or a few nights at the Film Forum. It is perhaps because he refuses to follow the pack that fashion editors, the most egregious pack followers of all, have had little use for him.</p>

        <p>After listening to designers relay their contrived references season after season -- Julie Christie in ''Darling,'' Petula Clark in ''The Runaway Bus,'' Golda Meir meets ''Sabrina'' -- there's nothing quite as refreshing as handing the microphone over to Hussein Chalayan. A few days before he showed his spring 2001 line for Tse New York at the Roseland Ballroom on Monday, Mr. Chalayan offered these words: ''I don't refer to anything really, anything historical, anything about clothes from the 60's, anything at all. It's based on the idea of a circle, a square and a triangle.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the clothes flowing from the sewing machines of most young designers, Mr. Chalayan's never seem a result of a trip to a vintage-dress dealer or a few nights at the Film Forum. It is perhaps because he refuses to follow the pack that fashion editors, the most egregious pack followers of all, have had little use for him.</p>
        <p>And that is a shame. Mr. Chalayan, who shows his own line in London, speaks of his work for Tse almost dismissively: ''It's not the collection I'd do for myself. I work on Tse more than I need to.'' Yet many ideas he explores in London -- architectural lines, the notion that the meaning of anything is never on the surface -- play out just as compellingly in the work he produces here.</p>
        <p>At his show, Mr. Chalayan displayed beautifully patterned sweaters and skirts, many of which looked as though they might unfold or unwrap. Some sweaters were layered in front; a skirt might tie overtly on the side or be draped in semicircular petals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chalayan's greatest trick, though, may be his ability to use colors and graphic prints so dramatically, and yet allow the woman wearing them to seem elusive, even chilly. Women who buy his clothes pay dearly for that image. He is the rare designer whose commercial line is priced higher than his own, more rarefied one.</p>
        <p>A few hours after the Tse show, a few hours after a group of editors discussed the ''shoe anxiety'' that accompanies attending Fashion Week, another designer who seems nostalgic for no other decade than the one she is living in showed her sportswear for the first time in a gallery in TriBeCa. Deborah Hampton spent years working as a designer for Michael Kors before moving with her husband to San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hampton's clothes are the kind a woman addicted to Jil Sander would appreciate: rich fabrics and lines as clean as on a Georg Jensen pitcher. Ms. Hampton displayed her clothes on a garment rack, and also on a wide video screen with models digitally imposed against background pictures her husband, Paul Moore, a photographer, took in the Arizona desert. She offered a smart khaki windowpane-pattern skirt suit, among other looks, and a rodeo shirt that looked not nearly as costumey as it sounds, in navy silk with beige patch pockets. She also showed what seems to be turning up on every runway: the shirtdress. Hers came belted, in a sleek above-the-knee white satin.</p>
        <p>The shirtdress, as something to go to a benefit in rather than as something to pretend you serve chicken on Lufthansa in, turned up repeatedly at the Badgley Mischka show, also on Monday. There were versions in full sequins and one in sequins with a silk panel in back. Going to see the evening dresses of Mark Badgley and James Mischka is like picking up a copy of In Style: you know you're supposed to be above the airbrushed glamour of it all, but the effort in both cases is completely unironic. The desire to make the Kirstie Alleys of the world look good is so utterly pure, you can't help taking it in with a smile.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Cole, who is now producing women's clothes, held his first runway show at Grand Central Terminal on Monday morning. There was little worth commenting upon -- white cotton shorts here; a patterned, pleated skirt that looked like last season's Marni there -- and one wished that Mr. Cole's clothes were as clever as his ad campaigns. Or as clever as his opener: before the show, Jon Stewart offered some political comedy on a video screen and encouraged the fashion crowd to vote.</p>
