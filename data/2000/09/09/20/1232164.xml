        <p>After building the most powerful insurance company in America over three decades, Maurice R. Greenberg apparently wanted nothing more than to leave one of his sons in charge when he died.</p>
        <p>But that dream seemed to evaporate yesterday with the abrupt announcement that Evan Greenberg, his 45-year-old son, was leaving American International Group. Mr. Greenberg had designated Evan, the president and chief operating officer, as the crown prince and had repeatedly defended him as the best choice for the job, even amid lingering speculation that his eldest son, Jeffrey, might have been the better choice.</p>
        <p>The announcement stunned Wall Street and set off a torrent of speculation about whether Evan had, in fact, quit or been fired, and whether Mr. Greenberg, the chairman and chief executive of A.I.G., might now be maneuvering to buy the big brokerage and investment firm Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies as a way of bringing Jeffrey back into the fold. Jeffrey Greenberg, 48, now chief executive of Marsh &amp; McLennan, resigned from A.I.G. in 1995, at a time when many were regarding him as a likely successor.</p>
        <p>Not that succession is imminent. Mr. Greenberg, at 75, is in robust health, remaining a fierce skier and tennis player. He adamantly insists he has no intention of retiring soon. While most shareholders back Mr. Greenberg's choices because of his strong track record, some have rebelled at the choice of a family member as successor. And analysts said they detected some uneasiness among board members.</p>
        <p>The tone at A.I.G. yesterday was subdued. John Wooster, the chief spokesman, said pointedly that Evan Greenberg, who had been with the company 25 years, ''resigned and was not fired.'' But he would not discuss the reason.</p>
        <p>Through the spokesman, the senior Mr. Greenberg said he was ''busy with meetings'' and could not return a reporter's call.</p>
        <p>But Evan Greenberg did return a call. There had been no blow-up, he said, no effort to push him off the track of succeeding to arguably the most important insurance job in the country. There had been no big problems in the company and no particular tensions with his father. And what of the criticism about his lack of a college degree, the talk that he might not be up to the top job? These, he said, had not been factors either.</p>
        <p>He spoke with admiration and respect for his father. Rather than being sad, he seemed in high spirits, relieved, perhaps, that after a quarter of a century of climbing the rungs in a company that in a way was an extension of his home, he was striking out on his own.</p>
        <p>''Everyone leaves home some time,'' he said. ''This is my time.''</p>
        <p>What does he plan to do next? ''I don't know,'' he said. ''I haven't figured that out yet. But I will.''</p>
        <p>He said he had come to the decision ''over a period of time, but recently concluded my decision.''</p>
        <p>His last day in the office was Monday. ''I told the C.E.O. I was leaving,'' Mr. Greenberg said, referring to his father. ''And we discussed it. And that was it.''</p>
        <p>He did not say how long the men talked and whether his father tried to change his mind. How did his father take the announcement? ''I don't think we want to get into that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Greenberg had struck a similar note when he resigned as an executive vice president in 1995, just weeks after Evan was awarded the same title, giving the appearance of a possible rivalry. He also said it was the right time to pursue an independent career, and also did not know what he would do next.</p>
        <p>Insurance analysts generally dismissed the idea that the senior Mr. Greenberg would try to haul Jeffrey back by buying his company. For one thing, a conflict of interest -- or at least the suggestion of it -- would arise from a giant insurer's owning a big brokerage firm. After all, a broker's reputation and profit rests on its ability to buy insurance independently for corporate customers.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Wooster nor Barbara Perlmutter, a spokesman for Marsh, would comment. Analysts said it also seemed unlikely that Jeffrey Greenberg would want to give up the independence he reportedly craved to return to A.I.G. while his father was still clearly in charge.</p>
        <p>Rather than swooning at the news of Evan Greenberg's departure, A.I.G.'s stock rose 13 cents yesterday, to $88.50. But some analysts said that its uptick, along with Marsh's, was probably less a comment on the departure and the speculation of a deal than a reflection of an upturn in many property-casualty and financial services stocks.</p>
        <p>From a strategic standpoint, no one had any doubt that A.I.G., a company with more than $268 billion in assets and revenue last year of $40.6 billion, would continue to dominate commercial coverage in the United States and much of the world and that its push into life insurance, investments, and car insurance would continue to thrive.</p>
        <p>''I don't see this as a disaster,'' said Michael Frinquelli, a principal in the Renaissance Fund Advisers, an investment fund that specializes in insurance, who has been following A.I.G. for more than 20 years. On the other hand, he said, ''I don't see this as a big positive for A.I.G., either.''</p>
        <p>''The concern involving Evan has been that this empire was always going to be in the Greenberg family,'' Mr. Frinquelli said. ''Now, if a non-Greenberg takes over next, I suppose people could see that as good. But Evan has been there in A.I.G. operations a long time and presumably some of the Greenberg touch rubs off on him.''</p>
        <p>Insurance experts said that several key A.I.G. executives had left in the last 18 months, creating tension between father and son. But several analysts and some former employees said they doubted the loss of the executives would have undermined the senior Mr. Greenberg's confidence in his son. That confidence, they said, had seemed unshakable.</p>
        <p>Tobey J. Russ, an executive who left A.I.G. in June to join the Chubb Group, said he felt the two had ''not only an excellent relationship,'' but that Evan had his father's ''private and very public support.''</p>
        <p>Other insurance experts talked of the senior Mr. Greenberg's reputation as a taskmaster and said the two Greenberg sons had been under even more pressure to perform.</p>
        <p>Evan Greenberg joined A.I.G. when he was 20 years old.</p>
        <p>He had been out of prep school three years and had been hitchhiking around the country, picking up jobs as a short-order cook and bartender. Through another A.I.G. executive, Mr. Greenberg's father offered him a job. The younger man agreed to start as an underwriter in the Denver office on condition that no one there be told he was the boss's son.</p>
        <p>On his way to the higher reaches of A.I.G., the younger Mr. Greenberg directed the company's operations in Japan and Korea and its international property-casualty business.</p>
        <p>While in the New York office he attended New York University and the College of Insurance, though he never earned a degree.</p>
        <p>Critics of the senior Mr. Greenberg's dynastic approach to succession have said that when a chief executive picks a relative as heir apparent well before he is expected to step down, some top-quality people -- seeing no chance to become boss -- go elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, analysts said there appeared to be something of a gulf in leadership between a handful of top A.I.G. executives in their 60's and most of the operational executives who are in their 30's and 40's.</p>
        <p>''There are not a lot of obvious successors,'' said one analyst, who, like most others with anything mildly critical to say, spoke only on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>''There are people who are clearly capable,'' he said, ''but there is not one person who stands out.''</p>
        <p>In its entire history, A.I.G. has had two chief executives: C. V. Starr, who founded the company in Shanghai in 1919, and Mr. Greenberg, who took over in 1967, after seven years with the company. Mr. Greenberg took A.I.G. public two years later. Under his direction it has been one of the most successful American companies, with its earnings and stock price growing at about 20 percent annually.</p>
        <p>At A.I.G.'s annual meeting in May, a handful of shareholder groups protested Mr. Greenberg's rule and his anointing of Evan during a joint trip to China in January. But as Mr. Greenberg reeled off another year of stellar achievements and announced another stock split, most shareholders at the meeting stared coldly at the complainers.</p>
        <p>When he was pressed about the choice of his son, Mr. Greenberg said curtly: ''We're not going to go into that again. That's been decided.''</p>
        <p>It has been hard to get a good, independent sense of how Evan Greenberg might have performed as chief executive. Subordinates have described his thoroughness and command of the nuances of the business. Some said he was brilliant.</p>
        <p>''The company considered him to be a talented insurance executive,'' said Weston Hicks, an insurance analyst at J. P. Morgan. ''He certainly commanded the respect of the troops.''</p>
        <p>In the phone conversation, the younger Mr. Greenberg said that while he had no idea whether he would stay in insurance, such a choice would be ''fairly natural.''</p>
        <p>''It's my craft,'' he said.</p>
