        <p>FILE sharing'' sounds innocent enough. But the practice of downloading files from the Internet is at the center of a battle between Internet-connected consumers and the entertainment industry. Today, file sharing refers mainly to songs that computer users download in the MP3 format from the hard drives of other users through services like Napster. The music industry calls this stealing. Those who swap files reply that it is the same as borrowing a CD from a friend. But while Congress and the courts wrestle with legalities of the music industry, file sharing is spreading to other creative works. As bandwidth expands, video games, movies and pay-per-view TV programs could be swapped as easily as songs. Already, multimedia file-sharing services like Gnutella and Scour Exchange provide a glimpse of this future.</p>
        <p>At the request of The New York Times, seven people agreed to discuss the issues. The participants were Hilary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, a trade group that represents the major record labels; David Boies, a New York lawyer who is defending Napster against an R.I.A.A. lawsuit; Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which recently held hearings on downloadable music; the filmmaker Kevin Smith, who directed ''Chasing Amy'' and ''Dogma''; Gene Kan, a Gnutella software developer; Esther Dyson, the author and venture capitalist; and Craig Newell, a 17-year-old consumer from Lynnfield, Mass. Befitting the topic, the discussion was conducted online, through e-mail.</p>
        <p>MATTHEW MIRAPAUL</p>
        <p>Q. Has anyone here shared files over the Internet?</p>
        <p>CRAIG NEWELL: My experiences have mostly been with Napster. On Scour Exchange, I've downloaded a music video from Britney Spears. One of the advantages of MP3 sharing is that you can get songs that aren't out on CD yet. Right now, songs like that are Christina Aguilera's ''Come on Over (Remix)'' and Madonna's ''Music.'' Also, I've purchased several CD's after listening to MP3's. It's a great way to see if the whole CD is worth its inflated price.</p>
        <p>GENE KAN: If one wants to get anything done on the Internet, it's going to involve the sharing of files. Improvement of file sharing is one of the best things that can happen to the Internet, because it is one of only a few things that we use the Internet for.</p>
        <p>HILARY ROSEN: File sharing is misnamed. When I share something with you, I only have a portion of it left for me. File sharing is really file copying. This activity is not per se bad; it is how it is often used that is the problem. While it might be useful for you to have a sample of an album before you buy it, it should be the choice of the artists on how to get it to you.</p>
        <p>KEVIN SMITH: I've never understood what the big deal was in regards to Napster. If someone likes an artist, they're going to buy the CD. The number of those who download and opt against buying the CD is very small. There are plenty of libraries in this country, yet people still buy books. The Napster opponents underestimate the American fascination with ownership.</p>
        <p>ESTHER DYSON: Because record companies lose revenues. The problem is that record companies now charge so much (and deliver so little to the artists on the other end) that people feel justified in stealing. Both sides are behaving badly. What's new is that the underlying infrastructure is changing, putting into artists' hands the ability to bypass record companies. Those that do not add value will no longer be able to charge for the service of pressing and distributing CD's.</p>
        <p>MS. ROSEN: Esther is right about the future, even if she is wrong about what a record company does. New distribution systems provide for new levels of competition, and record companies will have to prove their worth to artists in the new marketplace.</p>
        <p>SENATOR ORRIN HATCH: While some people's main interest is in file sharing, most people are interested in getting music they like in this new format. For a lot of consumers, a conveniently available, reliably high-quality product from a reputable source, in a secure form, is worth paying for if the price is right.</p>
        <p>Q. Does everyone expect the current situation, which mostly involves music, to spread to movies and other forms of digitized entertainment?</p>
        <p>MR. KAN: Too late. It already has. On an affordable high-speed line, one can already download a full-quality movie faster than one can watch it. That means all that stuff we read in the early 90's about video on demand is now actually true.</p>
        <p>MS. ROSEN: Sure, it will apply to anything that can be reduced to digital bits. The issue of ''value'' will become increasingly challenged. What is the value of ones and zeros? Nothing. What is the value of creativity, originality and imagination when it results in a work that we desperately want to listen to or watch or read? Now the bits have value. Are we as a society going to value the products of the mind the way we value products of the machine?</p>
        <p>MR. SMITH: With test-screening video dubs winding up in the hands of people who'll sell them to film fans, it's not a big leap to predict that you'll be able to watch a film that's not even been theatrically released yet on your computer in the very near future. I can't imagine the studios letting this happen.</p>
        <p>The music industry opened this Pandora's Box by leaking tracks on the Internet as a publicity device. No studio is going to put a movie up for file sharing. And that's where I think downloading music and downloading movies differ. With music, there's a high chance the downloader will still wind up buying the CD. For those who would download movies off the Net, the chances of them actually then paying to see the movie theatrically are slim. . . .</p>
        <p>File sharing of films would hurt the movie biz more than file sharing of music can hurt the music biz.</p>
        <p>Q. Will there ever be an effective way to prevent digital copying? If so, will consumers accept it, even if it means giving up some of the freedom of personal use they have now?</p>
        <p>MR. KAN: No. The summary is that if we can hear it or see it, we can copy it. Even assuming the most draconian of digital locks and chains, copying is unstoppable. And with the Internet, once the lock is unlocked once, the game is over.</p>
        <p>MS. ROSEN: Consumers rule. It can't be repeated enough. Nonetheless, I do believe there is value added to be gained by consumers with certain files that fans want that also just happen to be secure.</p>
        <p>MR. KAN: This is something that seems to have been overlooked. My belief is that the [members of the] R.I.A.A. can easily dominate digital-music swapping by offering high-quality music. I'd wager that most music shared on Napster has annoying skips and jitters. Quality is important to music listeners, and many would pay to get it.</p>
        <p>Q. Is there a business model -- subscription, pay per view, patronage -- that will accommodate the Internet and eliminate the concerns over file sharing?</p>
        <p>MR. KAN: The subscription model is interesting. Imagine if we all just contributed a few dollars a month to a national music fund. We could get access to all music, and artists would be rewarded based upon consumer demand. Another way is patronage, where Ford would leverage Metallica as an advertising asset. There are other models, too. But ultimately, if something has value, people will pay for it.</p>
        <p>MS. DYSON: There are a number of interesting answers. One that responds directly to Napster is Fairtunes.com. If you have listened to music on Napster and you'd like to make a voluntary contribution to the artist, you send it to Fairtunes, which will pass it on, minus some minor costs. The take so far is about $2,500 -- not a sustainable business model, but a good way to start. The problem is the notion that any particular business model is the answer. We have all-you-can-eat restaurants, Le Cirque, McDonald's, Mom's home cooking, Chinese takeout, soup kitchens, potluck parties. Each of these works; each is different. Each of these also fails a lot. On the Net, we will have all kinds of models, too. This will be a time of tremendous creativity in business models as well as in art.</p>
        <p>SENATOR HATCH: What we are seeing on the Internet is that decentralization -- ubiquity -- wins over top-down systems. Napster and Gnutella offer the most ubiquitous model on the Internet, and it could very well change the way the Internet works. There is an environment of free music which is very easy to use and decentralized. This may require lower prices than some companies want, but I think most people will pay for music and movies, knowing the source is legitimate, provided it's widely available. The problem is, we do not know because very little legitimate product is being offered at any price. That is changing. Music fans should have access to music they enjoy in the very near future on the Internet -- and in other digital media. Wireless phones may be the next portable music device. Movies should follow music.</p>
        <p>Q. Mr. Smith, your Web site (www.viewaskew.com) gives fan access to information they might not otherwise be able to get. The same could be done with your films. As an independent filmmaker, do you view the Internet as a piracy threat or a marketing opportunity?</p>
        <p>MR. SMITH: I'd lean toward the latter. I can't tell you how valuable our Web site's been to building our audience. If some of those fans wanted to download my flicks and trade them, they're welcome to. I have faith they'll buy the source material (on VHS or DVD) because packaging is important to people. Never underestimate the lure of a full-color box.</p>
        <p>DAVID BOIES: The Internet is both a threat and an opportunity. It is an opportunity to efficiently promote and build demand. It is a threat because it is a distribution and promotion channel that the record labels, at least for now, do not control. It is the greatest opportunity for the 98 percent of artists that are not distributed by the major record labels. It is the greatest threat to the R.I.A.A. and its members.</p>
        <p>SENATOR HATCH: I see the Internet as an opportunity for both creators and consumers. That was the goal of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act: to help develop Internet technologies by making it a place where copyright owners would feel comfortable making their works available knowing that copyright law applied. The problem for the recording industry is that it has tried to embrace this new technology on its own terms. There are difficult business issues here, but the problem is worsened the longer that consumers have limited sources for entertainment. I want consumers to have access to the music and movies they enjoy, and I think there will be more of it created if artists are compensated. I hope the creators and the Web side can get together. There are synergies here that could benefit everyone, especially consumers. In the end, technology will have the final say.</p>
        <p>Q. How involved should the government be in addressing these issues? And how effective can any government be in the border-free realm of cyberspace?</p>
        <p>MR. BOIES: No industry, and no government, can control the Internet -- for which I, at least, am grateful. If the R.I.A.A. succeeds in the U.S., they will simply drive Napster-like services to other countries. And as long as the services are free to consumers, there is nothing the R.I.A.A. can do about it.</p>
        <p>SENATOR HATCH: What we have seen so far is largely a dispute among the middlemen -- the labels and technology companies -- about business models and positions. It would be best to get the business folks to work out ways to serve their clients: the artists and consumers. If the artists are happy, there can be more works offered and enjoyed. But no one wins if consumers are not happy with the experience.</p>
        <p>MS. ROSEN: Artists, musicians, songwriters, music publishers and record companies are not asking for additional legislation. In selected areas, we merely seek the existing law to be enforced. The fact that a few companies are not abiding by the law does not mean that Congress needs to intervene. It simply means that the existing law should be respected.</p>
        <p>MS. DYSON: Sometimes we limit the government's role to passing laws and enforcing them. The government can also lead by example, publicize issues, foster discussion and apply moral suasion. Of course, it should do so carefully and openly, so we don't end up with rule by legislators/enforcers rather than by law. But what's wrong with a little propaganda if it's clear what it is? The government can ''encourage'' the market to work it out for itself -- or else.</p>
        <p>MR. SMITH: In substantial issues, like child pornography, yes, the government should play an active role. But in something like regulation of file sharing? Come on. So maybe -- maybe -- a few multimillionaires lose out on that extra $10,000 in royalties due to a few college kids not buying CD's. Is art really being raped here?</p>
        <p>Q. As Internet users mature, will they become the same solid citizens online that they generally already are offline?</p>
        <p>MR. KAN: They are solid citizens online right now. There are two things at work. First, people can't pay for downloads of the big-label music they crave. That's not their fault. Second, the majority of Americans do not think it an offense to trade music online.</p>
        <p>MR. SMITH: I think all this downloading is primarily an activity of the young. When you're raising a couple of kids and working for ''the man,'' you have no time to play pirate.</p>
        <p>MR. KAN: I'm not so sure. Napster is pretty popular among the Silicon Valley elite. I haven't encountered a single professional who doesn't swear by Napster. My mechanic uses Napster.</p>
        <p>MS. DYSON: I wish everyone were solid offline. The Internet would be very orderly without the people. So would the world. But the Net just reflects the people on it. We do need local rules, but not government rules, in most cases. There are already lots of regulatory systems on the Internet: eBay polices its auctions, the credit-card issuers police the merchants in response to customer complaints, online malls set quality standards, various privacy-seal programs are starting to work better, etc. When a crime is committed, they go to governments/courts for enforcement. It's a hybrid system, and it will remain hybrid, with an increasing number of players and regulatory bodies.</p>
        <p>Q. If file sharing is found to be illegal, should the government prosecute individuals for downloading, for instance, ''Dogma'' onto their hard drives? Which would be worse, a society in which every file transfer is monitored or one in which copyrights cease to exist?</p>
        <p>SENATOR HATCH: I think that future copyright-enforcement policy should and will continue to focus primarily on large-scale, commercial pirates. That makes sense from government-resources and prosecutorial-discretion perspectives, as well as common sense. Most people are not involved in doing major damage; we should focus on those that are. This ties in with the question of what most people's online behavior is likely to be. With [computer] software, casual copying was lessened by a combination of education efforts and evolving, maturing business models, with some exemplary prosecutions of large-scale piracy. I think that as the market matures for online entertainment, most people will follow, most of the time, the rules.</p>
        <p>MR. BOIES: If file sharing were in fact unlawful, the government would have to either enforce the law or change it. The absurdity of branding tens of millions of consumers as copyright criminals merely because they share music or other content on a noncommercial basis is what has led Congress repeatedly to provide that such conduct is not unlawful. The choice between an Internet without copyrights or copyrights without the Internet is a false choice. Experience shows that the noncommercial exchange of information over the Internet can coexist with a copyright system in which creative activity is rewarded by giving the copyright holder the right to control and be paid for all commercial copying.</p>
        <p>MS. DYSON: A policy of all-out prosecution sounds to me like the current war on drugs: not likely to be successful and likely to create more problems than it solves.</p>
        <p>Q. As file sharing spreads to movies and beyond, is the battle between consumers and the entertainment-industrial complex just starting -- or is the game over and the industry hasn't yet realized it?</p>
        <p>MR. KAN: It's starting, but the game will soon be over. As the phone company lays down bigger pipes to everyone's front door, and as the demand for convenient access to music increases, we will quickly see any windows of opportunity to control this groundswell of consumer demand close.</p>
        <p>SENATOR HATCH: Artists can still benefit from many promotional, business and financing services, so we are not necessarily facing the extinction of record companies and movie studios. But I hope we are moving toward a system where artists and the audience drive the process more. If the business mediators can find value-adding roles (as they should be able to), and if the artists and the audience can have a more direct relationship through this media, we need not have an adversarial relationship.</p>
        <p>MR. BOIES: Senator Hatch's vision makes good sense for all sides in this controversy because it recognizes that, particularly where artistic creativity is involved, the most satisfying relationships between artists and the public are based on mutual respect, access and an absence of greed. Fans would be lost without the work of the artists whose work they enjoy, but artists will be equally lost if they so alienate the public that the public ceases to provide support that artists need, financial and otherwise.</p>
        <p>MS. ROSEN: Consumers are the No. 1, 2 and 3 priority here. And what they want is music. They know, however, that they are getting a good free ride with Napster and its clones -- and they don't expect it to last. This isn't their battle, despite Mr. Boies's attempts to make it so. It is a battle between those who have created and invested in the music and a company that wants to make billions of dollars giving it away without having invested one nickel in its creation.</p>
        <p>MR. NEWELL: You might say the war has ended, but the battles have just begun. Although the entertainment industry will continue to fight it, the technology is way beyond anyone's control. I won't stop file sharing. If anything, I'm looking forward to more movies and videos becoming available. The possibilities are limitless. The catch: I really need a new computer for all of this.</p>
