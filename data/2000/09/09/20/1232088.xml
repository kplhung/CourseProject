        <p>FIVE years ago, white king salmon was a curiosity, if not a nuisance. When fishermen in the Pacific Northwest pulled it up, it went in the pile headed for the cannery or the smokehouse.</p>
        <p>The demand for wild king salmon from waters from Seattle to Alaska, after all, is for a large meaty fish with bright red flesh.</p>
        <p>White king salmon is unmistakable. Its flesh is as white as bone. That it has extraordinary flavor didn't matter. It wasn't red, or even pink.</p>
        <p>It could have remained unknown, except that in those five years, something else occurred: novelty became a big commodity in cuisine.</p>
        <p>The former misfit fish is now $20 a pound and known as ivory king salmon. And instead of being destined for the cannery, it is bound for restaurants on the level of Le Bernardin, Picholine and Alain Ducasse.</p>
        <p>It would be unfair, however, to say that novelty was the only reason for its success. This is much more than salmon without pigment. It is different from the red in taste, in texture and in many other subtle qualities. It has a softer flesh and is buttery and silky, less meaty and somehow less salmony. It tastes at once sweet, like a freshwater fish, and deeply of the sea. It is clearly salmon, but with flavors reminiscent of perch and Chilean sea bass. Compared with farmed salmon and even red king salmon, which tend to be oily and fishy tasting, white king salmon's delicacy is incomparable.</p>
        <p>''It's very fine, very delicate,'' said Alain Ducasse. Even he had not seen or tasted it until he cooked it recently in New York, but he now prefers it to the red. (He steams the salmon gently and serves it with a reduction of shallots, vinegar, tarragon, wine, pepper and olive oil.)</p>
        <p>Cafe Boulud has been serving it for just a year; Nobu bought some for the first time just a few weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Alaskan Feast, a purveyor in New York, was one of the first companies in the city to sell the fish. ''When we brought it in three years ago,'' said Dan Kim, a salesman, ''it was really hard to convince people to try it. Then they tasted it.'' Now, it is difficult to bring in enough. When Aquagrill in SoHo served it as a special last week, all 78 portions were gone by 10 p.m. ''I could sell 50,000 pounds right now if I could get them,'' said Robert Fusca, the owner of Ultimate Seafoods, a supplier in Tacoma, Wash.</p>
        <p>Only a very small percentage of king salmon is white, and there is no way to know until a fish is gutted whether it has white or red flesh. And whites have seasons that come and go with the predictability of wind. Preservation efforts limit the king salmon catch, so the fisheries are open only in certain weeks, determined month to month.</p>
        <p>Which is why you will never see white king salmon on a set menu. It is served as a special. And it turns up only sporadically in fish markets like Wild Edibles.</p>
        <p>Only about 6 to 8 percent of a king salmon catch is white salmon, said Kurt Sigfusson, a sales manager at the Seafood Producers Co-op, a purveyor in Bellingham, Wash., and Sitka, Alaska.</p>
        <p>Sales at the moment seem to exceed what people know about this fish, judging by what I was told by fishermen, chefs and distributors. One New York purveyor said that the season was over and that he was calling all his chefs to tell them to stop ordering it. Another told me it is a year-round fish. One said the fish was white because, unlike other salmon, it doesn't eat shrimp; another asserted that it was a unique species. Still another said it came exclusively from a small area off southeast Alaska.</p>
        <p>If only it were so elusive and mysterious. Ruth Withler, a research scientist with the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans in Nanaimo, British Columbia, has studied the fish. Of the five species of salmon in the Pacific -- silver, chum, pink, sockeye and king -- king is the only type with a white variety. Although her study produced no conclusions, it indicated that the white color was inherited and was simply a mutation. Two red king salmon, for instance, can produce a white.</p>
        <p>Ms. Withler has disproved the theory that white salmon don't eat shrimp, whose beta carotene colors the flesh of other salmon. She found that white salmon, if fed shrimp, just don't absorb the color. ''We suspect but we don't know,'' she said, ''that they have some kind of enzyme deficiency that prevents them from taking up the carotenoid.''</p>
        <p>She also found that the numbers of white king salmon increase the farther north one goes in the Pacific and the farther inland in the river system. It is available year round, more in summer than in winter.</p>
        <p>Unlike many fish, white king salmon that makes it to New York is almost always of exceptional quality. It is often sent overnight from the port. ''With fish being sent long distances, especially good fish like this, they don't mess around,'' said Jeremy Marshall, the chef at Aquagrill. For a shipper sending it from Alaska, it's not worth taking any chance that the fish might be rejected.</p>
        <p>Such quality, along with the price, has prompted chefs to put more than a little thought into how they treat the fish. To them, it is not like any other salmon. ''You must cook it more gently,'' Mr. Ducasse said. His method is like baking a potato in the sun: he cooks it for one minute in a pan, and then slowly steams it.</p>
        <p>Christer Larsson, the chef at Christer's in Midtown, rubs a hot plate with olive oil and cooks the fish with the heat of the plate for just a few minutes. Andrew Carmellini, the chef at Cafe Boulud, and Eric Ripert, the chef at Le Bernardin, both slow-roast it on a plate in a 200-degree oven for about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>When the fish is cooked this way, the oils warm up, the flesh softens and the whole thing seems to melt in the mouth. Mr. Carmellini intensifies the effect by spreading a spoonful of osetra caviar on top and laying it in a shallow puddle of cucumber sauce thickened with creme fraiche.</p>
        <p>Slow roasting in a low oven guarantees that the fish won't overcook from one minute to the next; you can monitor it carefully. It also allows you to enjoy the fish in a pure way. It does not color, so there are no caramelized edges, and it is rare in the center, so it is very much like sushi.</p>
        <p>Blue Ribbon Sushi, in fact, serves white king salmon as sushi and sashimi, both with a mustard and basil vinaigrette. Eaten this way, the difference between the white and red is even more striking. White is sweeter and more moist than red king salmon -- a flavor altogether more nuanced.</p>
        <p>Another easy way to cook the fish is to poach it with just enough fish broth and butter to cover the bottom of a shallow pan. As it simmers you can spoon the pan juices over the fish, or gently turn it. The fish cooks in just a few minutes.</p>
        <p>Because the fish is oily, it needs some kind of acidity. Using Mr. Carmellini's idea of a cucumber juice sauce, I made a watercress sauce, first wilting the greens in butter, then pureeing them with oil and rice vinegar and straining the pulp, so I got a leaf-green sauce. Just before serving, I thickened it with creme fraiche, which, with the rice vinegar, gave an edge to the fish.</p>
        <p>White king salmon also sautes beautifully and, surprisingly, can handle hearty flavors, as red salmon can. Mr. Marshall serves it with oxtail risotto and squash puree. Regular salmon often releases much of its oil when sauteed and becomes dry, but white king salmon becomes richer and juicier. I seasoned fillets generously with sea salt and coarse black pepper, heated butter and oil in a nonstick saute pan until it was almost smoking, then placed the fish skin side down and let it cook until the skin was brown as a hazelnut and covered with bubbles from the heat. I made a kind of succotash with corn, green beans and snap peas -- sweet and unobtrusive accompaniments -- and served a lemon wedge on the side to counter the richness.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carmellini sautes white salmon without skin and serves it with a stew of lentils and bacon and a tart red wine sauce. It is rare to find a fish that can handle both bacon and cucumber.</p>
        <p>If you prefer not to chase after your fish purveyor day after day trying to get white king, you can always taste it smoked from Petrossian. The white salmon there is mellow and tender, like a salmon and butter pate. I cut the crusts off black bread, toasted it, spread a horseradish cream on it and laid a little salmon on top. It made dark, delicious little sandwiches. Petrossian also sells what it calls Jamaican white salmon. Avoid this. It is as subtle as beef jerky.</p>
        <p>A fish as fine and rare as white king salmon is best unencumbered by strong flavors. Its taste of sea and krill and the Pacific should be as unmistakable as its color.</p>
        <p>SAUTEED WHITE KING SALMON WITH SUCCOTASH  Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>4 ears corn, husked  Sea salt  4 ounces green beans, trimmed  6 ounces sugar snap peas  4 5-ounce fillets white king salmon with skin  Freshly ground black pepper  6 tablespoons butter  1 tablespoon peanut oil  2 tablespoons thinly sliced chives  4 lemon wedges.</p>
        <p>1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add corn, turn off heat and let sit 5 minutes. Drain and cool. Cut kernels from cobs into medium saucepan, scraping off as much juice as possible. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add green beans and cook until tender and slightly crisp, about 3 minutes. Remove with slotted spoon and cool. Bring water back to a boil and add snap peas. Cook until tender but slightly crisp, about 3 minutes. Drain and cool. Halve green beans, and slice snap peas diagonally into  1/2-inch pieces. Add to corn.</p>
        <p>3. Generously season salmon fillets on both sides with salt and pepper. In a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter with the oil. When bubbles subside, add fillets skin side down. Cook until very brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Turn once and brown other side 3 minutes; fish should be slightly rare in center.</p>
        <p>4. Add remaining butter to corn mixture, place pan over medium heat and stir until thoroughly warmed. Add salt to taste, and stir in chives.</p>
        <p>5. To serve, make a bed of corn on each of 4 plates, and place a fillet on top, skin side up. Garnish with a lemon wedge.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>SLOW-COOKED WHITE KING SALMON WITH WATERCRESS BROTH  Time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons butter at room temperature  1 pound watercress, trimmed and washed  Sea salt  1 1/2 teaspoons rice vinegar  3 tablespoons canola oil  2 tablespoons creme fraiche  8 3-ounce pieces white king salmon, skin removed  Fleur de sel or another fine sea salt.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 225 degrees. In a large saute pan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add watercress and salt to taste. Toss until watercress has wilted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a blender, and puree a few seconds. With blender at low speed, gradually add rice vinegar and canola oil, scraping down sides of container as necessary.</p>
        <p>2. Strain mixture into small saucepan, pressing out as much liquid as possible with back of spoon. Place over medium-low heat, and whisk in creme fraiche. Adjust seasonings, and keep warm.</p>
        <p>3. Rub 2 remaining tablespoons butter on both sides of salmon pieces. Season lightly with salt. Place in shallow roasting pan about an inch apart. Bake, turning every few minutes, 8 to 12 minutes, or until surfaces of fish are opaque; centers remain rare.</p>
        <p>4. To serve, place 2 pieces of fish in each of 4 shallow bowls. Sprinkle with fleur de sel. Whisk watercress broth once more, and spoon around fish.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>WHITE KING SALMON WITH LENTILS AND RED WINE  Time: 1 hour 30 minutes</p>
        <p>5 tablespoons butter  1 medium onion, half cut into 1-inch pieces, half into  1/8-inch dice  1 medium carrot, half cut into 1-inch pieces, half into  1/8-inch dice  1 medium celery root, half cut into 1-inch pieces, half into  1/8-inch dice  2 celery stalks, one cut into 1-inch pieces, one into  1/8-inch dice  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  1 1/2 cups imported dark green lentils, rinsed  1 sprig rosemary  3 sprigs thyme  6 cups chicken broth</p>
        <p>1/4 cup heavy cream  3 slices smoked bacon  2 diced shallots</p>
        <p>1/4 cup red-wine vinegar  1 cup red wine  1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil  1 tablespoon mixed chopped herbs (like lemon thyme, oregano or tarragon)  1 tablespoon sherry vinegar  1 tablespoon corn or grape-seed oil  1 bay leaf  4 6-ounce fillets of white king salmon.</p>
        <p>1. In a large saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the 1-inch pieces of onion, carrot, celery root and celery. Season with salt and pepper, and saute until just beginning to soften, about 10 minutes. Add lentils, rosemary, 2 sprigs thyme and 5 1/2 cups chicken stock. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until lentils are tender, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Drain lentils, reserving liquid. Pick out and discard vegetables and herbs. Set aside half the lentils, and transfer the remainder to a blender. Add cream, and puree, adding reserved lentil broth just until the mixture has the consistency of a loose soup. Combine the puree with the lentils, and set aside.</p>
        <p>3. In a saute pan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter, and add diced onion. Saute just until the onion is translucent. Add diced carrot, celery root, celery, and salt and pepper to taste. Saute 5 minutes. Add remaining  1/2 cup chicken broth, and simmer until vegetables are tender and liquid evaporates, 2 to 3 minutes. Add to lentil mixture.</p>
        <p>4. In a medium saucepan, combine bacon and shallots. Place over medium heat, and stir until shallots are translucent. Discard bacon, and add red-wine vinegar. Reduce until pan is dry; then add red wine and reduce by three-quarters. Whisk in olive oil and remaining tablespoon butter. Add fresh herbs, and set aside.</p>
        <p>5. Warm lentil mixture over medium heat. Stir in sherry vinegar, and adjust salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm.</p>
        <p>6. In a large nonstick saute pan, heat corn oil over medium-high heat. Add bay leaf and remaining thyme sprig. Place fillets in the pan and sear, turning once, until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes a side. To serve, place a portion of lentils in the center of each of 4 plates. Cut each fillet in half, and place on top of lentils. Drizzle vinaigrette around the plate, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
