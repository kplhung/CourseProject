        <p>YOU can't sell haircuts over the Web, and the beauty salon industry is only cutting-edge in terms of scissors. But many hair-care products are sold to people who do the shearing, so while salons do not fit the dot-com prototype, they are grappling with the Internet revolution.</p>
        <p>They are, in fact, unlikely representatives of the kinds of woes and opportunities found in bigger, stodgier, less-fragmented industries that are struggling with the Web's shake-up of distribution systems. So far, the effects of e-commerce on the salon industry include online booking services, styling demonstrations and services that allow stylists far from the coasts to feel more in tune with the trendsetters of the hairstyling universe.</p>

        <p>YOU can't sell haircuts over the Web, and the beauty salon industry is only cutting-edge in terms of scissors. But many hair-care products are sold to people who do the shearing, so while salons do not fit the dot-com prototype, they are grappling with the Internet revolution.</p>
        <p>They are, in fact, unlikely representatives of the kinds of woes and opportunities found in bigger, stodgier, less-fragmented industries that are struggling with the Web's shake-up of distribution systems. So far, the effects of e-commerce on the salon industry include online booking services, styling demonstrations and services that allow stylists far from the coasts to feel more in tune with the trendsetters of the hairstyling universe.</p>
        <p>''It's very helpful to know what salons in the East and West Coast are doing,'' said Stacie Mosley, a co-owner of a salon in Des Moines, who regularly consults professional-only sites. ''The more informed you are, the better package you present.''</p>
        <p>The Internet has created slivers of niche content within the industry, like cosmetic colors worn by women from Venezuela and Argentina and the bleached-blond tips that signal Southern California skateboarder style. But Web sites promising online ordering have so far been unsuccessful at challenging the industry's entrenched distribution network, which annually ships $40 billion in shampoos and conditioners to the nation's 243,000 salons.</p>
        <p>The main reason is that the best-known makers of hair care products -- Redken, Sebastian, Matrix and Paul Mitchell -- control sales to salons through regional beauty-product distributors. For these manufacturers, the Internet is perceived as an arena in which products laden with powerful chemicals can end up in the hands of untrained customers who have bought them from unauthorized retailers. A longstanding battle to maintain control of the distribution of these products has not abated.</p>
        <p>For example, three Web pioneers in California -- Esalon.com, Clubsalon.com and Styleu4ea.com -- promised to sell professional goods on their sites only to have the major manufacturers refuse to supply them, just as investors began to pull back from Internet companies. The sites have been forced to retrench and may find it difficult to survive.</p>
        <p>In spite of these setbacks, e-commerce is likely to accelerate trends already reshaping the professional beauty business, including the proliferation of stylists who are ''booth renters,'' that is, independent contractors who lease a salon station. Because these stylists typically provide their own supplies, distributors are now opening trade-only shops to serve them. But the mobile cosmetologist could just as easily order online from home.</p>
        <p>''If I was a distributor, I'd be afraid,'' said Roy A. Fredericks, the owner of three shops in Austin, Tex., who established Salon.com, one of the first salons in cyberspace. (He later sold the domain name to the Internet magazine Salon and reregistered at www.salon.net.)</p>
        <p>With Esalon and others regarded as catalysts, five of the nation's largest beauty suppliers recently agreed to put rivalries aside and jointly create their own site for beauty professionals and their clients. ''We'd better invest our own money in the space or someone else will,'' said W. Thomas Amen, the chief executive of West Coast Beauty Supply, in Benicia, Calif., one of the five partners.</p>
        <p>West Coast Beauty Supply's representatives take orders for 37 product lines and introduce new items to 30,000 salons in twice-monthly visits. In a trial for online ordering, the company expects to equip about 100 of its largest clients with computers soon. The joint venture, known as the Beauty Consortium, acquired Clubsalon.com's domain name and its order technology from Outshopping.com, an Internet consulting company, and expects to be operating by November, Mr. Amen said. ''If we don't, the distribution channel will break down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It might, anyway. The manufacturers have yet to sanction this venture, either, although they appear receptive. While slow to establish commerce online, they are not about to be excluded.</p>
        <p>Steven V. Goddard, the chief executive of the United States unit of Wella A.G., envisions transferring to the Internet the sort of services the company already provides to 2,000 salons -- like inventory control, interior design and financial management. ''We've invested money in that model,'' he said, declining to discuss further details.</p>
        <p>Within the industry, the most talked about beauty site is Behindthechair.com, which sidesteps any conflicts with producers over selling shampoo by defining itself as a private portal for professionals. Make no mistake, though; commerce is its play. The site's founder, Mary Rector-Gable, a former beauty-industry recruiter who personally contributed $1 million as start-up capital, is not shy about her ambition.</p>
        <p>''We want to be the Forrester of the beauty industry,'' said Ms. Rector-Gable, referring to the Internet market researcher in Cambridge, Mass. Besides siphoning advertising from trade magazines, she intends to resell to manufacturers data from the site's registration process. The line between advertising and content is thin: advertisers can suggest guest hosts for the site's weekly online chats.</p>
        <p>Behindthechair, which is based in Roselle, Ill., quietly went about acquiring content that matches its graphics: sewing up broadcasting rights to the industry's avant-garde hair shows; licensing curriculum from the leading beauty school educator, Milady; and striking alliances. One of these is with Sassoon, which has agreed to supply the site with its archive of training videos.</p>
        <p>In a buzz-generating introduction in February, the site Webcast live from Los Angeles the National American Hairdressing Awards, whose winners are industry icons. ''We've locked up everything,'' Ms. Rector-Gable said. ''I've got a huge head start.''</p>
        <p>Playing catch-up on a different track is Styleu4ea (www.styleu4ea.com) in Chatsworth, Calif. Forced to abandon e-commerce with salons, the site's backers are now relying on graphically appealing content that describes products and hairstyles,  which they hope to make available on the site beginning this month. Parts of the site's virtual store, where products from various manufacturers are showcased, are already being resold for use in trade show booths.</p>
        <p>For $149 a month, Styleu4ea plans to offer salon owners a computer, access to an online industry magazine and, every three months, a CD-ROM of six styling tutorials. The demonstrations, which allow stylists to manipulate a three-dimensional mannequin, use a motion-capture technique used by film animators. The instructors are industry-recognized ''platform artists,'' typically hired by manufacturers and beauty schools to demonstrate products and techniques to stylists at seminars or trade shows.</p>
        <p>''We'd love to put everything on the Net,'' said Richard Gregerson, Styleu4ea's chief executive. But the typical strip-mall salon, if it has a computer at all, cannot download the demonstration videos; hence the use of CD-ROM's. ''The industry is all about flash,'' he said. ''If you're not going to deliver it, then you might as well be an engineering company.''</p>
        <p>But for some, time may be running out. Styleu4ea's flash has five months to ignite before the company exhausts its current operating capital from private investors, Mr. Gregerson said.</p>
        <p>Esalon, based in Santa Monica, Calif., squandered its first-mover advantage after generating momentum this spring with mentions in trade magazines and promotional stops at trade shows. ''We clearly made mistakes by introducing an e-strategy to a business that wasn't ready,'' said Anthony L. Davis, the chief executive and co-founder of Esalon, which laid off 40 of its 60 employees by June. ''The endgame may not be an I.P.O. but to be acquired.''</p>
        <p>The company's strategy is being retooled, although Mr. Davis declined to say how. ''Investors want to keep the company alive,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the Internet, fashion trends move with lightning speed, so the successful hairdresser needs to tap every opportunity to expand his repertoire, said Stephen J. Moody, the general manager of the Los Angeles Vidal Sassoon Academy, the industry's most exclusive beauty school. ''We all have to be better at what we do,'' he said.</p>
