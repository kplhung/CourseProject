        <p>KATIE the audio technician and I were sitting in the Staples Center in Los Angeles, waiting patiently for our next assignment at the Democratic National Convention, when I asked her to participate in a little experiment.</p>
        <p>''Do you need to buy anything?'' I asked, even though I had just met her and some people might have found that question too personal.</p>
        <p>She looked at me quizzically for a moment, and I could see the brain scan going.</p>
        <p>''Yes, in fact, sure,'' she said. Her eyes lit up. ''A bomber jacket.''</p>
        <p>''Good,'' I said, and asked her to join me at the computer to test bots.</p>
        <p>''What's a bot?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>A bot is a digital version of a personal assistant, I told her, which scans shopping sites and spits out lists of items and prices.</p>
        <p>It is sort of like visiting several stores, but only going into one. This seemed particularly alluring because we were stuck in the convention hall, close to lots of hot air but nowhere near a good shopping mall.</p>
        <p>''Neat!'' Katie said.</p>
        <p>Personally, I was wondering whether bots could still be as worthless as the last time I tried them.</p>
        <p>Bots were all the rage last Christmas, hyped by the technology media at every turn, jamming the airwaves with commercials, but they seemed like vaporware to me -- overpromoted and underperforming. The bots I had tried were cluttered and unfriendly and usually produced too much information, all of which turned out to be worthless.</p>
        <p>I also wondered, as I often did with the Internet, how bots could ever be a viable business. To be of any use to a consumer, they had to scan as many sites as possible, and surely not every site would pay for the referral. So how did I know I could trust the information I was getting from a bot?</p>
        <p>The theory behind the technology was great, but the reality was a different matter. A bot did not necessarily give you unbiased, comprehensive information.</p>
        <p>E-shopping experts seemed to agree with me. ''I haven't found a bot yet that grabs every single bit of related information, or every single site,'' said Steve Haskin, managing editor of Botspot, a digital newsletter about bots. ''I don't think there's one bot out there that does it all yet.''</p>
        <p>Ken Cassar, senior retail analyst with Jupiter Communications, said bots faced a fundamental economic problem.</p>
        <p>''Consumers aren't willing to pay for the service,'' Mr. Cassar said. ''As a result, they have to pursue advertising as a revenue model. The problem is, that creates potential conflict between their advertisers, and the way some bots have gotten around it is to provide a search for best price. They make their money from referrals, but they'll accept advertising from manufacturers.''</p>
        <p>That is why, he said, ''the editorial integrity issue is one that's a bit dicey for the bots.''</p>
        <p>So, back to our shopping expedition. Katie and I, basking in the windowless workspace at the Democratic convention, started our search.</p>
        <p>As a veteran of way too much online shopping, I knew that finding clothing might be particularly challenging. Because of the nature of the merchandise, much e-commerce has been focused on items like electronics, software and computer hardware -- goods you do not necessarily need to see or try on to buy.</p>
        <p>Lately, that has been changing, said Josh Goldman, president of MySimon.com, a bot purchased by CNET in January for $700 million. ''Frankly, we're amazed now at the breadth of categories,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''Fashion and gourmet foods and high-priced bottles of wine. It's astounding to me that it's becoming mainstream.''</p>
        <p>Not mainstream enough yet, apparently. MySimon.com turned up just two bomber jackets for women, neither of which satisfied Katie.</p>
        <p>Hotbot Shopping did not have any listings for ''bomber jacket.'' Excite Shopping called up all sorts of bomber jackets, from panne velvet numbers to leather versions that offered no pictures for us to see. Several other bots we found listed on Botspot turned out to be defunct.</p>
        <p>EAGER to spend some money and realizing that we were not getting anywhere, Katie remembered there was something else she had been wanting to buy: a copy of her son's favorite childhood book, ''Muggins Mouse.''</p>
        <p>Bestbookbuys.com promised to search 14 different sites, but turned up 458 titles, not one of which was the one we were seeking. No luck at Bookblvd.com, and two other book bots, listed on Botspot, were out of commission.</p>
        <p>This is where my surfing experience came to the rescue: I had found hard-to-trace books before on Bibliofind.com and Alibris.com, which search for old, used and rare books, so off we went. Katie did not want a $774 scarce, mint condition edition, but we did find a copy for $15 from a bookseller in Florida. Katie was delighted.</p>
        <p>But technically, we had not used a bot.</p>
        <p>Eager to put one to the test, I did try several to track down the price on a Nikon Coolpix 990, a camera that my fiance had recently bought and would have married if a man could marry a camera.</p>
        <p>Another, different saga than the bomber search: I kept getting confusing lists, filled with lenses and adapters and other peripherals. Buried among them were prices on actual cameras, but more times than not, once shipping or member fees were added, the prices were virtually the same. Had I actually been buying the camera, I would have at that point gone to the online store I know and trust.</p>
        <p>The experts said that I should not give up hope, that bots had just begun to evolve into what will be their eventual state.</p>
        <p>''Long term, it will be something many, many different aggregators use in conjunction with coupons and reviews,'' Mr. Cassar of Jupiter said. ''The problem is that right now since shopping bot functionality was developed to be used rather in a vacuum, it has not been integrated well with other types of content online.''</p>
        <p>Will it ever be? Mr. Haskin of Botspot thinks so.</p>
        <p>''I still think we're dealing with maybe late Model T's. They haven't really begun to display the promise the computers have yet.''</p>
        <p>Maybe not. And maybe they will. But for now, the next time I need to buy something, I'm going to go direct to the stores I know -- online and off.</p>
