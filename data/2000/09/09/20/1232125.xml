        <p>Technology stocks, under pressure for much of September, moved sharply higher yesterday, driving the Nasdaq composite index to its biggest one-day gain in more than three months.</p>
        <p>A good day in the bond market and a dip in oil prices provided a positive backdrop for stocks. But traders and analysts said that computer-related shares were ready for some sort of corrective bounce.</p>
        <p>''We had seen a pretty ugly market for the first couple of weeks this month, and some of the stocks had been pretty oversold,'' said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. ''But that doesn't remove the uncertainty of third-quarter earnings, which is why I am not convinced this rebound will feed into a sustainable rally.''</p>
        <p>Led by gains in Intel, JDS Uniphase and Microsoft, the Nasdaq composite index gained 139.12 points, or 3.7 percent, to 3,865.64. It was the biggest one-day gain in the index since June 2.</p>
        <p>Even after yesterday's rise, however, the Nasdaq is down more than 8 percent from its close on Aug. 31.</p>
        <p>Other major market averages were mixed.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.39 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,459.90, helped by stocks like Cisco Systems, Nortel and EMC.</p>
        <p>But weakness in cyclical stocks like Alcoa and International Paper were a drag on the Dow Jones industrial average. The blue-chip index fell 19.23 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,789.29.</p>
        <p>Twelve stocks fell for every 11 that rose on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume on the Big Board exceeded one billion shares.</p>
        <p>''We have had spots of pretty good activity, but I don't see investors putting the pedal to the metal on either the sell or the buy side,'' said Bill Allyn, head of listed trading at Jefferies &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Intel, which has been under selling pressure this month, was the most actively traded issue yesterday, rising $4.56, to $60.38.</p>
        <p>JDS Uniphase jumped $10.13, to $107.94. Microsoft gained $2, to $65. And PMC Sierra soared $22.94, to $224.31.</p>
        <p>Alcoa fell $1.31, to $25.81, after the company said it expected third-quarter profit to fall short of Wall Street estimates. The company cited higher energy costs and slower sales of its aluminum products to the building and transportation industries.</p>
        <p>Ingersoll-Rand, a maker of construction equipment and architectural hardware, also issued a profit warning, and its shares fell $4.06, to $35.69.</p>
        <p>Biotechnology stocks had a day of strong gains. Genentech rose $4.38, to $160. Immunex gained $2, to $45. And Human Genome Sciences closed at $153, up $9.</p>
        <p>Falling interest rates helped lift bank and financial services stocks. Bank of New York rose $1.38, to $51.81. And Citigroup was up 41 cents, to $53.97.</p>
        <p>The American International Group closed up 13 cents, at $88.50, after Evan Greenberg abruptly resigned as president. The move leaves the company with no clear successor to Mr. Greenberg's father, Maurice Greenberg, who is chief executive.</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Rise</p>
        <p>(By Bloomberg News</p>
        <p>Bond prices rose yesterday after a two-week slump. Anticipation of tomorrow's Treasury Department repurchase of outstanding debt also lifted bonds.</p>
        <p>''Clearly there's more value than a few weeks ago with bond yields up 20 basis points, and there are a few nibblers,'' said Gary Zeltzer, who was holding on to bonds he bought earlier this year for the $10 billion he invests at J &amp; W Seligman &amp; Company. ''A lot of people are swinging for a 6 percent bond yield from 5.65 percent in late August, but I don't think we'll get there.''</p>
        <p>The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32, to 99 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.85 percent from 5.87 percent on Monday.</p>
        <p>The 30-year bond rose 20/32, to 104 24/32. Its yield fell to 5.91 percent from 5.95 percent on Monday.</p>
