        <p>The Times Square of legend takes a last loopy bow in Richard Sandler's engaging documentary ''The Gods of Times Square.''</p>
        <p>In its foreground a study of urban theology as it examines the relationship of man and God in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Sandler's film, opening today at Cinema Classics,  has as its background the earth movers and cranes that transformed the seedy Times Square of yesteryear into the Disneyfied magnet for tourists and families of the new millennium.</p>
        <p>At the same time, ''The Gods of Times Square'' is a good-humored, tolerant celebration of New York City's diversity and eccentricity and of its incubation of sidewalk philosophers, like the homeless man who discusses Einstein and atoms while the camera seeks out a flashing sign that illustrates the lecture.</p>
        <p>In this Times Square, street musicians play drums, violins, saxophones and clarinets; men dance; beggars shake cups; people sleep on sidewalks and in subway passageways; and enormous billboards of half-clad underwear models loom over the teeming sidewalks like the grotesque symbolic eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg's sign in ''The Great Gatsby.''</p>
        <p>In his quest for religion in Times Square, Mr. Sandler examines the angry black Jews who rail against the white man and call for the lynching of homosexuals.</p>
        <p>He encounters, among many others, the Jews for Jesus; James, the mystical, bearded old black man in his Panama hat and clerical collar who gives enigmatic answers to questions about religion; the Lubavitchers, waiting for the Messiah and driving the big van they call their Mitzvah Tank; and Jim, the 32-year-old man who eventually lays claim to being the second coming of Christ.</p>
        <p>Before revealing this identity, Jim, speaking in 1993, makes a few predictions for Jesus in the coming year. ''Starting 1994, he's going to do rock,  music, marry Madonna, going to be the biggest rock star that ever existed, get into international affairs,'' Jim says. Jesus' album is going to go triple platinum. ''I've heard his demo,'' Jim declares. And, he adds, ''He's not against smoking, by the way.''</p>
        <p>A young Muslim raps about Allah.</p>
        <p>''Jesus is it,'' says a woman. ''All these other phony baloney gods, they're worthless.''</p>
        <p>An 82-year-old man talks about knowing Jesus. ''I just know God,'' he says. ''That's my hobby.''</p>
        <p>But soon the construction cranes loom against the sky, and the family that owned the little hot dog stand nestled among the old movie theaters west of Seventh Avenue on the north side of 42nd Street gathers for a tearful farewell to the old Times Square.</p>
        <p>Enter Mickey Mouse. Enter Dopey.</p>
        <p>THE GODS OF TIMES SQUARE</p>
