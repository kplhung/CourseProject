        <p>Silky smooth, the river flows through pampered banks, and anglers, crouching to cast lines to skittish, savvy trout, like to say that this is their shrine, the place where the arcane arts of fly-fishing were honed one hundred and more years ago. Indeed, this spot where willows weep and the waters sparkle is known not just to Britons but to American fly-fishers too as the cradle of their skills.</p>
        <p>Yet throughout the summer this three-mile stretch of the River Itchen, crisscrossing the water meadows of Hampshire near Winchester, has been propelled from understated idyll to burning issue. A local conservation agency struck dread into the hearts of the anglers by decreeing that part of the hallowed Abbotts Barton fishery must be allowed to revert to nature.</p>
        <p>No more would riverine weeds be trimmed or bankside reeds cut back to create a perfect habitat for trout -- a kind of piscatorial Hilton with just the right mix of sheltering weed and gravel beds. No more would the streamside footpaths be cropped smooth for the benefit of anglers. No more would farmed brown trout be stocked alongside wild brown trout, and no more would voracious pike -- which eat most things from ducklings to milder species of fish -- be kept far away.</p>
        <p>The anglers struck back. Letters were written to The Times of London. Legislators were drafted into the fray. Fly-fishing magazines took serious umbrage. ''Cultural vandalism,'' thundered Total Flyfishing. ''Tragedy at Abbotts Barton,'' said Trout and Salmon. And, for all the episode had echoes of the summertime silly season, there were -- as in the stream itself -- darker currents.</p>
        <p>Was this in essence a class war between the conservationists and the 25 anglers in the Abbotts Barton club -- known, in fly-fishing parlance, as rods? The members brave a five-year waiting list and then pay $1,500 a season to fish three days a week six months a year.</p>
        <p>Or was it a broader question of where conservation begins and ends. Does it start, for instance, before the time in Roman Britain when the rivers were first harnessed to drive mills, or later, in the mid-17th century, when farmers created a complex of ditches and carrier streams to flood the surrounding water meadows?</p>
        <p>Or, yet later, in the late 19th century when, as industry overtook agriculture in Victorian Britain, anglers  took over the waters for their sport and managed them as a place devoted to the business of catching trout using bits of feather and hackle tied to barbed hooks?</p>
        <p>The answer, perhaps, lies in a particular British reverence for chalk-stream waters like the Itchen and its sister stream in Hampshire, the Test, where fly-fishing has become especially refined as a skill and where access is largely restricted to sometimes snooty clubs and syndicates whose annual fees make the Abbotts Barton water look cheap.</p>
        <p>''This can rightly be described as the cradle of dry-fly fishing,'' with the fly on the surface, said Roy Darlington, 59, who held the lease to the Abbotts Barton fishery for 25 years.</p>
        <p>The local Hampshire Wildlife Trust -- one of a plethora of environmental agencies -- ended Mr. Darlington's tenure this year, giving him until the end of September, when the season closes, to wind up his affairs on the two-thirds of the fishery it owns. The rest is owned by a local family that has not objected to the anglers' regime.</p>
        <p>To explain the finer points, which might seem arcane to nonfishers, or even to people satisfied with worms on hooks or plastic lures, Mr. Darlington said that, up till the late 19th century, people who fished with imitation flies did so by casting their lines downstream with the lures submerged.</p>
        <p>In 1879, however, a group of English fly-fishers, including Frederic Halford and G. S. Marryat, took over the Abbotts Barton fishery and began experimenting with upstream fishing using imitations that floated on the surface. That caused a revolution in equipment. Then, in 1883, a young lawyer, George Edward Mackenzie Skues, also began fishing here, and noticed that many trout feed not only on hatching insects on the surface but also on larval insects underneath.</p>
        <p>He, too, devised new techniques to cast a line upstream, using what are termed nymphs. ''Modern fly-fishing has its origins here,'' Mr. Darlington said.</p>
        <p>But the issue is not solely about fishing, says the Hampshire Wildlife Trust, which bought the Abbotts Barton property in 1981 to forestall housing and other development. Rather, the trust argues, it is about what flourishes there, how it is managed and who gets to enjoy it.</p>
        <p>''In essence, it is a nature reserve that's been intensively managed for fishing,'' said Ian Woolley, the trust's chief executive officer. ''We would like to see biodiversity and not just for trout.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, he said, since the trust suspended Mr. Darlington's lease this year, preventing him from intensive management of the river and banks, ''there are many varieties of flowers and insects that are there now and weren't there previously.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Darlington sees it differently. ''We argue that it's because of management over 400 years or more that there is biodiversity for the wildlife,'' he said. And without management, he said, the reeds would clog carrier streams, reducing water flows. The streams would silt up, raising water levels so that the area becomes swampy, with less varied flora and fauna.</p>
        <p>Some anglers seem to think that they are being penalized by the trust as if they were seen as spoiled toffs despite their varied, nontoff backgrounds. But Mr. Woolley says that his membership ''includes the whole range of classes from the urban poor to the extremely rich.''</p>
        <p>''We have some millionaires and some people on unemployment,'' he said. ''We want the whole spectrum of society to visit'' Abbotts Barton.</p>
        <p>A compromise may be in the works, permitting fewer anglers -- only 15 -- to fish on shorter stretches of managed water while the rest of the fishery is left to nature. Mr. Woolley says the proposal is under consideration as part of a five-year plan for the whole area of streams and water meadows that could, indeed, make parts of the property soggier than now.</p>
        <p>''The fishing is one of a whole series of issues,'' Mr. Woolley said, but ''we are not going to walk away and turn it into a bog.''</p>
