        <p>By any clock, it's not Howdy Doody time in the dank universe of puppets and cockroaches that inhabit the gloomy stage sets for ''Snuffhouse Dustlouse.''</p>
        <p>One leathery, beady-eyed puppet is reliving the seminal moment of childhood when his bedraggled mother hacked off his skinny legs. For comic relief, the heads of two pickled puppets chatter from the depths of simulated formaldehyde jars. Then tragedy strikes with the untimely electrocution of a faint green, starving hand puppet that emits gray puffs of smoke in its flailing last gasps.</p>
        <p>There is not a child in the sold-out audience. But that doesn't faze the British creators, the Faulty Optic partnership of Gavin Glover and Liz Walker, who draw inspiration less from Punch and Judy than from movies like ''Eraserhead'' or ''Delicatessen,'' a dark French comedy about the lifestyles of contemporary cannibals.</p>
        <p>The Henson International Festival of Puppet Theater is hoping that this emphasis on the bizarre and the profound will appeal to appreciative adults. The biennial festival, which will end on Sunday after appearances by 26 puppet companies over 19 days, increased its theater seating across the city by more than 30 percent this time in the expectation that puppets could collectively draw a crowd that could almost fill a stadium: more than 36,000.</p>
        <p>''It was a bit of a gamble to be much larger, but we do expect that we will sell out the theaters,'' said Cheryl Henson, a daughter of Jim Henson, the Muppets' creator, who conceived the idea for the festival, first held in 1992. Since then the ticket-buying audience has more than tripled and, Ms. Henson said, the ancient art has been transformed into a hot new art form.</p>
        <p>Festival organizers are convinced that there is a growing adult audience for dark themes like celebrity worship, contaminated blood supplies, genetic engineering and memories of odd child rearing practices. That view is backed by the emergence of puppet chic, with creatures of rod and rags and strings becoming cafe society darlings and, recently, the boardroom opening act for the merger of the international media conglomerate of Vivendi, Seagram and Canal Plus.</p>
        <p>If puppets are newly fashionable, there is nothing new about the art, which dates at least as far back as the ninth century B.C., when puppets performed in religious contexts in India and China. More recently puppetry has taken on glamour and intrigued adults in Julie Taymor's productions of ''The Green Bird'' and ''The Lion King.''</p>
        <p>Puppetry is also flourishing as a club act at coffee spots and bistros with New Age labels like Puppet Slam or Puppet Uprising.</p>
        <p>In Boston and Providence, R.I., Puppet Slam is the generic term for late-night puppet cabarets modeled on poetry slams, with short, cutting-edge concepts in performances involving a number of puppeteers. Some shows draw professionals, others rank amateurs.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes they're funny, sometimes they're sophomoric,'' said Karen Larsen, the artistic director of the Puppet Showplace Theater in Brookline, Mass. ''Sometimes they're elegies to people who have died. The quality quite varies between people who are really experienced and people who have never done it before.'' Her theater started extending its reach with performances in clubs about four years ago, a notion that has spread to other cities.</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, the cabaret show ClubPuppet was presented for one night in June at a club called the Joint after puppeteers responded to a call for material that was ''comedic, adult-oriented, sexy, topical and cutting-edge.'' That night Chuck the puppet worked the bar and Valerie VaVoom presided as puppet hostess while the anorexic foam tube Stixie Chicks performed a dance about eating disorders.</p>
        <p>In Philadelphia, the Puppet Uprising presents late-night cabaret shows every other month in a small community theater of 130 seats that generally sell out, with the shows featuring five or six short performances. Philadelphia also holds the distinction of being home to a nascent free-speech movement for puppets.</p>
        <p>Last month more than 75 puppeteers were arrested in a West Philadelphia warehouse where giant puppet cockroaches and skeletons were being assembled for use in demonstrations against the death penalty during the Republican National Convention.</p>
        <p>Police said they found materials that could be used to build bombs or blockades. The puppetistas, as they call themselves, argued that chicken wire, chain, pipes, rags and bottles were also the makings of puppets and that the arrests were merely an attempt to stifle protest. The arrests have been immortalized in performances at Puppet Uprising, with four undercover police officer puppets posing as volunteer carpenters to infiltrate a cardboard warehouse.</p>
        <p>''I think this emergence of the new object theater,'' a term for forms that move, ''is really not so new,'' said Matthew Hart, 29, founder of Spiral Q, a community puppet workshop in Philadelphia that in a separate incident was briefly closed down before the convention for building-code violations. Puppets with a political message long since took to the streets in such troupes as Bread and Puppet, which was founded on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1962 and still flourishes in Vermont.</p>
        <p>''We're really revisiting the roots of puppetry,'' said Mr. Hart. ''The intimacy of manipulating puppets is back because it's just so simple and old that people feel comfortable with it. And I think that stories can be told so much more honorably with it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hart, who was arrested with the puppeteers in the West Philadelphia warehouse, describes himself as a puppetista and provides an all-encompassing definition: ''It's anyone who uses a puppet for social justice. You can be a puppetista with a paper bag puppet that talks back to your boss.''</p>
        <p>But bosses are also relying on puppets to deliver potent messages. In early July, Jean-Marie Messier, chairman of the French-based company Vivendi, met employees of Universal in a town hall gathering in California after an announcement of a three-way merger with Universal's parent, Seagram; and Canal Plus into what would be the second-largest media conglomerate in the world.</p>
        <p>''Just to show you that I'm not looking at myself too seriously,'' Mr. Messier told the Universal employees, he screened a video clip featuring himself as a puppet caricature, from the satirical French television show ''Les Guignols de l'Info.''</p>
        <p>The adult interest in puppets has been raised to new levels by the Henson Festival, say veteran puppeteers, who for years felt isolated on the fringes of theater. Mr. Henson's notion of a festival was born from a desire to broaden puppetry's appeal.</p>
        <p>Before he could make the idea a reality, he died of a pulmonary infection in 1990. Cheryl Henson, the second-eldest of his five children, went ahead with it, presenting 17 puppet companies at the first festival in 1992.</p>
        <p>This year's festival is the largest of its kind in the United States. When it is finished, six of the puppeteer troupes involved will embark on a  tour of more than a dozen cities, including Los Angeles, Pittsburgh and Washington.</p>
        <p>The heightened interest in puppetry for adults has its advantages and disadvantages. Some puppeteers lament a tendency among artists to be preachy and overly serious, while others revel in the new freedom to tackle intellectual themes and lavish projects.</p>
        <p>''To my taste it's in a dark period,'' said Bob Nathanson, director of Puppets To Go and a humor consultant for the Puppeteers of America, a national organization with about 2,000 members. ''I don't want to say that puppeteers should lighten up, but I think they could use more humor in the darker shows to get audiences more involved. Humor is a very important tool, but I think some people are afraid to use it because it might lessen the impact of the message.''</p>
        <p>The hunger for serious puppetry has furthered ambitions, with artists borrowing from serious works like Milton's ''Paradise Lost,'' Goethe's ''Faust'' and Oscar Wilde's ''Salome.'' Hanne Tierney, who adopted ''Salome,'' reflects the broader vision of puppetry for adults.</p>
        <p>She avoids the label puppeteer, preferring '' performance artist'' for herself and ''figures'' or ''characters'' for her abstract puppets. Her puppets are shimmering swaths of sequined fabric, aluminum coils and ropes of beads manipulated by 77 strings.</p>
        <p>''I always wanted to be a writer,'' Ms. Tierney said of her evolution. ''I finally faced the fact that I wasn't good enough, and I started thinking about three-dimensional writing. I saw that I could do it with this kind of theater.''</p>
        <p>With so much experimentation taking place, ''funds are now available for some puppeteers to create works on a large and lavish scale,'' said Steven Abrams, the president of Puppeteers of America. ''Works of great power and complexity have been produced that would have been unimaginable 20 or 30 years ago.''</p>
        <p>But the life of a professional puppeteer can still be a struggle to move  out from the fringes. Earlier this year Ms. Henson was the host of a fund-raiser at her New York loft that raised more than $5,000 to benefit the creator of the Cosmic Bicycle Theater, Jonathan Edward Cross, 33, who has used the money to finance his quirky circus sideshow of clowns and puppet oddities, ''Assemblage of Souls.''</p>
        <p>After the Henson festival his company is extended its presence in the city by two weeks with performances at the Here Arts Center in the South Village. After that ends, Mr. Cross doesn't know what he will do next. By necessity, his puppets are made of found scraps from the Lower East Side, like an abandoned shell of a grandfather clock turned into a little theater and a dancing puppet fashioned from a metal colander, an eggbeater and a bronze torso fished from the trash. Last year Mr. Cross was forced out of the two-room commercial space that doubled as his living room and little theater, Clockworks. He lives in a nearby storage basement and showers at the homes of friends.</p>
        <p>''Before I had a theater, and now I don't have studio space; it's very precarious,'' said Mr. Cross, who  does not consider his poverty romantic. ''I went all out on this show because I thought then this could get me to my next show.''</p>
        <p>His alter ego in his current show, the ringmaster P. T. Radaghast, has an antidote for such gloom: a raucous circus at the ends of the earth, with giddy clowns and an assortment of scrap puppets who serve as the resident performers of the Puppet Odditorium.</p>
        <p>The ringmaster's words linger in the theater as he charges off toward a big top made of umbrella and striped red tablecloth. When despair threatens, he intones, there is always: ''Puppet Show!!''</p>
