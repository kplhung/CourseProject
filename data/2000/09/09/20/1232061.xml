        <p>IF you spent any time at the grill this summer, you probably charred a vegetable or two and anointed it with olive oil or a drizzle of balsamic vinegar or lemon. A platter of grilled vegetables is a handsome sight, and more than once it has made me look like a hero.</p>
        <p>But just beyond that simple success there is a frontier to be crossed, a dish so improbable that only a true barbecue buff could have conceived it. I'm talking about grilled soup.</p>
        <p>I suppose it is possible to simmer a pot of soup over the fire, and maybe a cowboy or two has done it. But I have something more audacious in mind: flame-charring the ingredients for the soup on the grill.</p>
        <p>As in the case of many of my favorite dishes, I stumbled on grilled soups by accident, this time while trying to smoke some tomatoes for gazpacho. Normally, I would use a water smoker. But on this day my smoker was occupied by a turkey. So I fired up a grill, tossed some oak chunks on the coals, and charred the tomatoes, peppers and onions over the fire.</p>
        <p>They made a stunning gazpacho. Instead of a blunt, heavy smoke flavor, it was rich with the taste of flame-charred vegetables. The high heat of the grill caramelized the vegetables, producing a natural sweetness and light smokiness. And unlike smoking, grilling vegetables chars them on the outside, allowing you to add color, texture and character to a soup in the form of tiny pieces of seared skin. (You don't want to get carried away here: there's a difference between seared and burned.)</p>
        <p>If grilling could so utterly transform gazpacho, I wondered what it could do for corn chowder. I grilled some corn my favorite way -- without the husk -- and then cut the kernels off the cobs. The soup had the sweetness of a traditional chowder and the smoky flavor of grilled corn on the cob.</p>
        <p>Soon I was grilling peppers to make bisque, and fish to make chowder. I even tried grilling all the vegetables for a minestrone, a painstaking process I won't be repeating anytime soon.</p>
        <p>But in every other case, the effort was worth it. The simple process of grilling the ingredients does something wonderful to soup, especially when using wood smoke. With a charcoal grill, you can grill over wood. Hardware stores sell bags of oak or hickory chunks, which can be lighted in a chimney starter and used as you would charcoal. For an even easier wood fire, there are instant-lighting Cookout Bags,  paraffin-coated wood chunks packaged in flammable paper bags made by W. W. Woods and sold at grill shops or on the Internet at www.woodinc.com. You simply light the corners of the bag for a wood fire that's ready for cooking in about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>You can also build a conventional charcoal fire and toss soaked wood chunks or chips on the coals. If your gas grill has a smoker box, place the wood chips in it; if not, wrap them in foil, pierce the top of the package with a pencil, and place it directly over one of the burners, under the grate. When using gas, preheat the grill until you see smoke, then place the vegetables on the grate.</p>
        <p>And don't feel limited by the end of grilling season. You can char vegetables under the broiler or sear them in a grill pan all year long.</p>
        <p>GRILLED GAZPACHO  Time: 35 minutes after heating grill, plus 2 hours for cooling and chilling.</p>
        <p>4 cloves garlic, peeled and skewered on a toothpick  1 medium red onion, peeled and quartered (leave root end attached)  4 to 5 ripe tomatoes (about 2 1/2 pounds)</p>
        <p>1/2 red bell pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 green bell pepper  1 cucumber, peeled, halved and seeded</p>
        <p>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil  2 to 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar, or to taste  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives.</p>
        <p>1. Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high.</p>
        <p>2. Add wood chips to fire. When smoke appears, arrange all vegetables on grill, and cook until dark brown on both sides, 3 to 6 minutes a side, depending on the vegetable. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool.</p>
        <p>3. Remove toothpick from garlic. Cut roots off onion. Scrape any really burned bits of skin off vegetables, and cut into 1-inch pieces.</p>
        <p>4. Puree in a food processor or blender. Add oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and enough water to obtain a thick but pourable soup,  1/2 to 1 cup. Chill for up to several hours.</p>
        <p>5. Just before serving, taste and adjust seasoning, adding salt or vinegar to taste. Ladle into bowls, and sprinkle with chives.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>GRILLED CORN CHOWDER  Time: 40 minutes after heating grill</p>
        <p>6 ears corn, shucked  1 medium onion, peeled and quartered (leave root end attached)  1 green bell pepper or poblano chili  1 red bell pepper  2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons olive oil  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 strips bacon, slivered  2 tablespoons flour  1 large baking potato, peeled and diced  1 bay leaf  5 cups chicken or vegetable stock  2 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley  1 cup heavy cream.</p>
        <p>1. Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high.</p>
        <p>2. Add 1 cup soaked wood chips to the fire. Brush corn, onion and peppers with 2 tablespoons oil, and season with salt and pepper. Grill until dark brown on all sides, 8 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, and let cool. Cut kernels off corn cobs. Cut roots off onion. Finely dice the onion and peppers.</p>
        <p>3. Heat remaining oil in a large saucepan.  Add bacon, and brown over medium heat, 2 minutes. Stir in flour, and cook 1 minute. Stir in potato, bay leaf, stock, vegetables and half the parsley, and bring to a boil. Reduce  heat, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in cream, and cook 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve in bowls, with remaining parsley sprinkled on top.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
        <p>YELLOW PEPPER BISQUE  Time: 40 minutes after heating grill</p>
        <p>4 cloves garlic, peeled and skewered on a toothpick  1 medium onion, peeled and quartered (leave root end attached)  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  Coarse sea salt and fresh black pepper  6 large yellow bell peppers4 cups chicken or vegetable stock  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar, or to taste  4 basil leaves</p>
        <p>1/2 cup heavy cream  1 teaspoon brown sugar (optional)  4 basil leaves, cut in thin strips.</p>
        <p>1. Set up grill for direct grilling, and preheat to high.</p>
        <p>2. Brush garlic and onion with 1 tablespoon oil, and season with salt and pepper. Place on grill with peppers. Cook until garlic and onions are nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes a side, and peppers are charred black on all sides, 4 to 6 minutes a side, turning with tongs to ensure even grilling. Transfer garlic and onions to a plate to cool. Place peppers in a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let cool, or place in sealed paper bag.</p>
        <p>3. Unskewer garlic, and trim roots off onion. Scrape burnt skin off peppers. Core and seed peppers. Place all vegetables in saucepan with broth, remaining oil, vinegar and the 4 whole basil leaves. Simmer over medium heat until vegetables are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>4. Puree soup in blender. Add cream, and run machine in short spurts just to mix. (Don't blend too much, or cream will separate.) Strain into saucepan, and simmer 2 minutes to serve hot. Or strain into bowl, and let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate, to serve cold. Add sugar if needed for sweetness. Serve in bowls, garnishing each with the basil strips.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
