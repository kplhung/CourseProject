        <p>Trying to pressure New Jersey prison officials to disclose whether they are making promised reforms in caring for mentally ill prisoners, a prominent human rights group today released a long-suppressed 1998 report that said  the state's treatment of those prisoners was cruel and neglectful.</p>
        <p>The group, Human Rights Watch, an international advocacy group based in New York, says it believes that the same conditions may persist today at New Jersey prisons. But state corrections officials say that they have fixed the problems and that the report is out of date.</p>
        <p>The 1998 report was commissioned by lawyers for inmates who sued the state in 1996 over the treatment of mentally ill prisoners. It found that conditions were often inhumane, with prisoners overdrugged, often filthy, frequently punished for actions related to their illness, and lacking adequate therapeutic care.</p>
        <p>The report, by Dr. Dennis F. Koson, a psychiatrist and nationally recognized expert on mental health care in prisons, was a crucial document in forcing the state to settle the inmates' suit and to agree to take steps to improve conditions. But as part of the settlement, the state insisted that Dr. Koson's report remain secret. The ban was lifted by a New Jersey judge only last month at the intervention of Human Rights Watch, which gave a copy of the report to The New York Times today.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the inmates are dissatisfied with the state's progress since the settlement, but they are limited in what they can say publicly. A special state monitor has been making quarterly reports on the state's progress to both the inmates' lawyers and state prison officials. But those reports, at the state's insistence, are also secret, and the inmates' lawyers are forbidden to disclose what they read.</p>
        <p>So, as the State Department of Corrections released a brief statement today criticizing Dr. Koson's  once-secret report as out of date,  advocates for the inmates goaded the state by saying, in effect, ''Show us.''</p>
        <p>''If they maintain that they are complying with the terms of the settlement, why aren't they agreeing to release the monitor's reports?'' said Sandra Cobden, a lawyer with Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, the Manhattan firm that handled the inmates' suit on a pro bono basis. ''We would gladly consent to releasing them.''</p>
        <p>Since they may not even refer to what they have seen in the monitor's report, Ms. Cobden and her co-counsel, Patricia Perlmutter, can only refer to conversations they say they have had with inmates in charging that the conditions found by Dr. Koson's report still exist.</p>
        <p>''I'm not commenting on whether or not the monitor agrees with what we're saying because I can't,'' Ms. Cobden said. ''What I can tell you is that we are hearing from our clients  about the continuing problems that Dr. Koson found.''</p>
        <p>In a one-page statement, the Department of Corrections pointed out that Dr. Koson visited state prisons in 1996 and 1997, and that his report was now more than two years old. It also listed 10 aspects of the department's reforms, from its employment of 210 mental health professionals to its $17.7 million budget next year for inmate mental health care. And the statement said the department had complied with the settlement.</p>
        <p>On the inmate lawyers' challenge to release the monitor's reports, the department spokesman, Chris Carden, refused to comment except to note that the sealing of the report was part of the settlement.</p>
        <p>The 98-page report was based on 410 interviews Dr. Koson conducted with prisoners and staff members on visits to five state prisons and a youth home.</p>
        <p>The opening paragraph of his conclusions reads: ''The treatment of mentally ill inmates in the New Jersey Department of Corrections is among the worst I have seen in my 15 years of inspecting correctional systems nationwide. The extensive shortcomings identified in mental health treatment services, the lack of any special facilities for mentally ill inmates, and the harsh disciplinary practices have the net effect of causing significant injury to seriously mentally ill inmates. Almost every medical record that I have reviewed offers evidence of the misery of mentally ill inmates.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Rosen, a lawyer based in Chatham, N.J., who represented Human Rights Watch in its suit to open the Koson report, said the burden of refuting Dr. Koson's findings rested with the state.</p>
        <p>''They say that they have fixed these problems, but they will not provide any evidence that they have,'' Mr. Rosen said. ''This should be a monumental settlement, but we're in the dark, and no one in the state is turning on the lights.''</p>
