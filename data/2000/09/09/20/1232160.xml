        <p>'' I have felt more disillusioned  than anybody here. I guarantee it. I thought that getting involved in public service would be the very last thing that I ever did. . . .</p>
        <p>Some of the people with the highest ideals, the best hearts, the loftiest dreams, are the ones who are most reluctant to get involved in politics or the political process. Maybe they feel their good hearts are brittle. Maybe they feel  they're going to be let down, disillusioned, heartbroken. For whatever reason, maybe, including some of the experiences that our country's been through, starting with those assassinations that I mentioned, people just kind of stay at arm's length. So I'm asking you to choose the future of our country with this simple act.  Open your heart. I'm saying this directly to you. I don't mean this to be heard as rhetoric.''</p>
