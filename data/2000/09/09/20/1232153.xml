        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that an article in The New York Times yesterday was unfair to New York because it created an impression that the city's future economic growth was imperiled by a shortage of office space.</p>
        <p>The article said that a severe lack of office space was posing a challenge to the city's ability to retain companies and attract new businesses. Although Mr. Giuliani did not dispute any facts in the article, he said during a news conference that the city's growth was not in danger.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that an article in The New York Times yesterday was unfair to New York because it created an impression that the city's future economic growth was imperiled by a shortage of office space.</p>
        <p>The article said that a severe lack of office space was posing a challenge to the city's ability to retain companies and attract new businesses. Although Mr. Giuliani did not dispute any facts in the article, he said during a news conference that the city's growth was not in danger.</p>
        <p>''Since I've been in office, there've been 27 projects totaling 25.5 million square feet of new office space completed or under way,'' the mayor said. He added that the amount of office space created in New Jersey for Manhattan businesses moving across the Hudson River was minuscule compared with new construction under way in New York City.</p>
        <p>''Yes, there's growth in New Jersey,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''That's a healthy thing. We can't handle everything. We have limited space. And at this point there are some people who feel we're too crowded in terms of the number of buildings we have, the office space we have, and what we're producing for our economy. And our economy is doing better than it's been doing in about 40 years.</p>
        <p>''However, the article also gives the impression that we're not staying ahead of the curve,'' he added. ''That also is not true.''</p>
