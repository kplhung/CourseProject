        <p>After striking out several times in their quest to add a significant player to their roster, the Knicks could become one of several teams looking to benefit from the recent circumstances surrounding Joe Smith and the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p>
        <p>The National Basketball Association is expected to void Smith's contract with the Timberwolves because the two parties entered into an illegal agreement meant to undercut the league's salary-cap rules. If that happens, Smith, a former No. 1 draft pick from the University of Maryland, would become a free agent. A 6-foot-10-inch power forward, he could provide the Knicks with the frontcourt depth they have been seeking.</p>

        <p>After striking out several times in their quest to add a significant player to their roster, the Knicks could become one of several teams looking to benefit from the recent circumstances surrounding Joe Smith and the Minnesota Timberwolves.</p>
        <p>The National Basketball Association is expected to void Smith's contract with the Timberwolves because the two parties entered into an illegal agreement meant to undercut the league's salary-cap rules. If that happens, Smith, a former No. 1 draft pick from the University of Maryland, would become a free agent. A 6-foot-10-inch power forward, he could provide the Knicks with the frontcourt depth they have been seeking.</p>
        <p>Knicks General Manager Scott Layden could not be reached for comment, and Coach Jeff Van Gundy would not speak about Smith. But Van Gundy is known to like Smith's game and his untapped potential.</p>
        <p>After a solid but unspectacular rookie season with Golden State, he enjoyed his finest season, averaging 18.7 points and 8.5 rebounds a game, in 1996-97. His production has fallen in each of the three subsequent seasons, and last season he averaged only 9.9 points and 6.2 rebounds in 25.3 minutes a game off the bench for Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Though he lacks bulk, Smith is a strong rebounder who has a career average of 7.5 rebounds in 32.1 minutes a game.</p>
        <p>The Knicks could offer Smith their $2.25 million midlevel exception, and only two teams, the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Clippers, could do better. Several other clubs, including the champion Los Angeles Lakers, are expected to offer Smith the midlevel exception and a lot of playing time, so the Knicks' chances of acquiring Smith are not great.</p>
        <p>The Knicks also have an interest in the veteran shooter Chris Mullin, though it is not known whether they will offer him a contract. Mullin, 37, the former St. John's star, was put on waivers by the Indiana Pacers last week and is a free agent.</p>
