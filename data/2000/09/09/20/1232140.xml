        <p>Israel canceled a scheduled meeting with Palestinian negotiators today, raising concerns that the fragile peace effort had reached another potential breaking point. But by day's end, the Israelis had arranged another meeting for Wednesday.</p>
        <p>After the first cancellation, Palestinian negotiators quickly condemned the Israelis for what they described as an indefinite suspension of negotiations, saying the move put in question Israel's commitment to the peace effort.</p>
        <p>''This is a regrettable decision that shows that the Israeli government is trying to prepare for itself a path out of the peace process,'' said Saeb Erekat, a senior negotiator.</p>
        <p>But Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office quickly started playing down today's cancellation, describing it as insignificant hiatus intended to give the Israelis time to assess where things stood in the deadlocked peace effort. And after a string of murky comments from Mr. Barak's associates, his office announced at 9 p.m. that ''contacts'' would resume on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''The meeting will be a continuation of the meetings that took place at the beginning of the week and after such a meeting did not take place today,'' the announcement said.</p>
        <p>The Israelis are taking pains to distinguish between ''meetings'' and negotiations. Mr. Barak's spokesman, Gadi Baltiansky, said the Israelis did not believe that negotiations have resumed since the Camp David peace summit meeting in July -- only ''meetings to see if we can find a basis to resume negotiations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Erekat, however, suggested that the Israelis were being disingenuous.</p>
        <p>He said that in the first two days of meetings, a schedule had been established that apportioned time for all the major issues on the table in the final-status peace negotiations. He said he was surprised by today's cancellation. Later, he said he was dizzied by the re-scheduling.</p>
        <p>Emmanuel Rosen, the diplomatic correspondent on Israeli television's privately owned Channel Two, described what Mr. Barak was doing today as ''something between a muscle flexing and a cry of S O S.''</p>
        <p>Speaking on the Israeli radio, Danny Yatom, Mr. Barak's security adviser, maintained that there was no rancor involved. ''We are not angry with the Palestinians, and they are not angry with us,'' he said. But he suggested that the Palestinians consider taking a more ''moderate, constructive'' approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak himself linked the resumption of negotiations -- as opposed to ''discourse,'' which he said was ongoing -- to a demonstration of greater flexibility by Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader.</p>
        <p>In a fiery interview on Palestinian satellite television tonight, Mahmoud Abbas, who is known as Abu Mazen, expressed intense frustration with the Israeli and American pressure on the Palestinians to compromise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abu Mazen, who is secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization and is in line to succeed Mr. Arafat as chairman, said the Americans threatened the Palestinians at Camp David.</p>
        <p>''We were threatened with a cut in U.S. aid if we did not sign,'' he said. ''And if we signed, we were promised more aid. Here we are talking about a superpower.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Abu Mazen said the Palestinians would not concede ''our legitimate rights,'' including full sovereignty over East Jerusalem. But he suggested that the peace effort should not disintegrate into violence, since the Palestinians would lose an armed conflict with Israel.</p>
        <p>''The struggle does not necessarily mean that we carry arms,'' he said. ''Our struggle is in holding strong. We know the capabilities of other side. They have all the power, and we have nothing.''</p>
        <p>The peace effort has been troubled since Camp David, when in 15 days the Israelis and the Palestinians made significant headway on almost every issue except the status of Jerusalem. Both sides claim that there has been backsliding since then in the conversations that have taken place sporadically between their senior officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's associates said he placed the possibility of returning to a summit meeting and reaching a deal at less than 50 percent, which is why the prime minister has turned his energy to the civic reforms that he hopes to initiate before he meets his political fate when Parliament reconvenes at the end of October.</p>
        <p>Then, if he has not reassembled a majority coalition, he will face a serious challenge to his continued leadership, with the possibility of new elections. If no agreement with the Palestinians has been reached, the peace effort would probably be frozen by the move to elections.</p>
        <p>''Time is important,'' Mr. Abu Mazen said tonight. ''But we won't let it become a sword directed at our necks.''</p>
