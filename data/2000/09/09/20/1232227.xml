        <p>Vacationing workers may escape the office, but that does not mean they escape work. Over half the workers questioned in a survey by Andersen Consulting contacted their office while on their most recent weeklong vacation.</p>
        <p>And the survey of white-collar workers in office settings found that only 10 percent resented the intrusion. That was not surprising, considering another finding: workers who did not maintain office contact returned to an average of 37 e-mail messages and 11 voicemail messages and spent about six hours answering them.</p>

        <p>Vacationing workers may escape the office, but that does not mean they escape work. Over half the workers questioned in a survey by Andersen Consulting contacted their office while on their most recent weeklong vacation.</p>
        <p>And the survey of white-collar workers in office settings found that only 10 percent resented the intrusion. That was not surprising, considering another finding: workers who did not maintain office contact returned to an average of 37 e-mail messages and 11 voicemail messages and spent about six hours answering them.</p>
        <p>Forget just leaving the number of a hotel or resort. One-third of those surveyed said they had left their cell phone number with a colleague; one third checked their office voicemail messages and one in six took along a laptop computer.</p>
        <p>Tom Davenport, director of Andersen's Institute for Strategic Change, saw a mixed blessing in the new technology that helps workers stay connected. They may be more productive, but they are deprived of the stress-free environment vacations are meant to provide, he said.</p>
        <p>''I think the lesson is that we have to start making very conscious choices about these issues,'' Mr. Davenport said. Employers need to establish policies to help workers break free from their work, he added, or else the traditional vacation could become obsolete.</p>
