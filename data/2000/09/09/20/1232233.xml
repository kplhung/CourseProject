        <p>BROOKLYN: JANITORS SETTLE  Janitors at Brooklyn Renaissance Plaza, on strike since May 16, and the building's owner, the Muss Development Company, said yesterday that they had settled their differences. Muss had come under increasing pressure from elected officials as well as from a June hunger strike by janitors. The company had refused to allow the janitors to join the Service Employees International Union. Under the agreement, the janitors are allowed to join, and to get increased wages and benefits.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: NEW HOUSING CHIEF  Jerilyn Perine, a planner in the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, was appointed commissioner of the department yesterday by Mayor Rudolph W.

        <p>WHITE PLAINS: PRISON BALLOT MEASURE  Voters in Westchester will decide in November whether to demolish a county penitentiary and build a $60 million prison. On Monday, the Westchester County Legislature voted 16 to 1 to put the referendum on the ballot, after a state report called the 84-year-old penitentiary, in Valhalla, unfit for inmates and staff. The new penitentiary would have the same number of beds, 280, but more space for educational and rehabilitation services, said Gary F. Kriss, a spokesman for the Legislature.</p>

        <p>MANHATTAN: HOSPITAL OFFICIAL ARRESTED  A top official at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center's obstetrics-gynecology unit has been arrested and accused of embezzling $435,000, the authorities said. Terence Davidson, 48, has been the department administrator for the hospital unit since October 1995. Last year, the United States attorney's office charged in a complaint, Mr. Davidson began siphoning off money from a department account for personal use. Daniel A. Conti, Mr. Davidson's lawyer, acknowledged yesterday that his client established the account but said he acted ''at the behest of supervisors.''</p>

        <p>MADISON: POWER PLANT TO USE WIND  The largest wind-power generating station in the state is scheduled to begin commercial operations at the end of this month, its owner said . Known as a wind farm, the power plant is also the first on the East Coast to sell power to commercial energy distributors, according to its owner, the PG&amp;E National Energy Group of Bethesda, Md. The plant's seven propeller-driven turbines, each rising 220 feet above the cornfields of Madison County, will generate 11.5 megawatts of electricity.</p>

        <p>BINGHAMTON: SWASTIKAS FOUND  The State University of New York at Binghamton is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for several swastikas, one drawn in human feces, found in a residence hall bathroom. The university police are investigating four reports since Sept. 5 of graffiti containing swastikas and obscene language at Bingham Hall. About 27 percent of the student body is Jewish, according to the university.</p>

        <p>BROOKLYN: FIRE TRUCK IN COLLISION  A fire truck and a school bus carrying developmentally disabled adults collided yesterday, injuring 5 firefighters and 15 people on the bus, the authorities said. No serious injuries were reported. The bus driver and passengers were all treated and released from the hospital yesterday, said a spokesman for Appropriate Transportation, the bus company. The accident occurred in Brownsville, Brooklyn, as firefighters from Ladder Company 111 responded to a report of a gas odor in a Bedford-Stuyvesant building.</p>

        <p>NEW JERSEY</p>
        <p>DENNIS TOWNSHIP: BUS CRASH INQUIRY  The driver of the New Jersey Transit bus that veered off a highway here Monday and hit an unoccupied house died of a heart attack, a spokesman for the state police, Sgt. Al Della Fave, said. The Cape May County Medical Examiner plans further tests to determine whether the driver, James R. Rapp, 49, of Blackwood, died before, during or after the crash, he said. Some of the seven passengers on the bus told investigators that Mr. Rapp appeared to slump in his seat before the bus went out of control. New Jersey Transit said Mr. Rapp had been classified as medically fit to drive.  Robert Hanley (NYT)</p>
        <p>WOODBRIDGE: E-ZPASS EXPANSION  E-ZPass is now available along the entire 173-mile Garden State Parkway, two years later than state lawmakers originally envisioned. Installation of the system was finished yesterday at the south end of the highway as automated toll lanes opened at the Great Egg and Cape May toll plazas. Motorists with an electronic windshield-mounted tag now can use 116 of the 161 toll lanes dedicated to the E-ZPass system, a parkway spokesman, Dennis Ingoglia, said.</p>

        <p>HAMILTON: TEACHERS APPROVE CONTRACT  Members of the Hamilton Township Education Association yesterday overwhelmingly approved the three-year contract that ended an eight-day strike in the school district. The union voted 951 to 192 in favor of the contract, which gives teachers raises totaling more than 13 percent, according to Karen Joseph, spokeswoman for the education association. The school board is scheduled to vote on the contract tonight. Classes for the district's 13,000 students began Monday after the opening of school was delayed by a walkout that started Sept. 6.</p>

        <p>HARTFORD: LOBSTER CATCH DOWN  A survey of catches in Long Island Sound found a decline in the number of lobsters large enough to harvest this year. The study by the State Department of Environmental Protection, the first comprehensive survey since a large number of lobsters were discovered dead last year, found 8,274 lobsters were caught, or an average of 69 lobsters per trip. That represents a 40 percent decline from 1998, when there were 109 per trip, and a 12 percent decrease from last year's survey, when there were 86. The survey examined 120 trips between Norwalk and New London earlier this year.</p>
