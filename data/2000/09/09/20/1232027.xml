        <p>EMERIL LAGASSE, the reigning chef of the airwaves, may know his way around the kitchen, but he admits he is lost in cyberspace. ''I'm a little illiterate when it comes to the computer,'' he said. ''I'm still an old-fashioned pen-and-pad kind of guy.''</p>
        <p>No matter. It does not dampen his enthusiasm about his Web site, www.emerils .com, which has been online for about three years.

        <p>EMERIL LAGASSE, the reigning chef of the airwaves, may know his way around the kitchen, but he admits he is lost in cyberspace. ''I'm a little illiterate when it comes to the computer,'' he said. ''I'm still an old-fashioned pen-and-pad kind of guy.''</p>
        <p>No matter. It does not dampen his enthusiasm about his Web site, www.emerils .com, which has been online for about three years. Based in New Orleans, the site offers a range of Mr. Lagasse's products -- from spices like Bayou Blast to Emerilware, his line of cookware -- as well as recipes, feature articles and links to Mr. Lagasse's six restaurants (three in New Orleans, two in Las Vegas and one in Orlando, Fla.).</p>
        <p>So far, his Web experience has been rewarding. ''We're averaging about three million hits a month,'' said Mr. Lagasse, who has written five cookbooks, is the host of two shows on the Food Network and appears weekly on ABC's ''Good Morning America.''</p>
        <p>''People mostly go to the site for information about my TV shows or my restaurants,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The site allows Mr. Lagasse to keep in touch with his fans. ''I have a page on the site where I keep people abreast of what's happening every month, and I write a piece called Emeril's Garden,'' said Mr. Lagasse, who is also featured on the Food Network's site, www.foodtv.com, which has been rated one of the top five food sites by Media Metrix, a firm that tracks online data. ''I'm having a lot of fun with it.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Boulud also likes the immediacy of the Web.</p>
        <p>He runs his site, www.danielnyc.com, from an office beneath the kitchen of Daniel, his restaurant in Manhattan. ''We update it every day,'' said Mr. Boulud, the author of ''Cooking with Daniel Boulud'' and ''Cafe Boulud Cookbook.'' While the site sells his books and high-end products like caviar and smoked salmon, it primarily focuses on content: Mr. Boulud's recipes, a cooking column called Ask the Chef, links with his restaurants (Daniel and Cafe Boulud), news and events.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing to me is that it is informative,'' he said. ''We use it to show our menu, or culinary travel, where if I'm traveling or a chef of mine is traveling, we can show pictures and talk about what is inspiring us. We also get a lot of feedback from people about their experience in the restaurant or questions about cooking.''</p>
        <p>These days, chefs are no longer just in the kitchen. Many are building culinary empires that include television programs, cookbooks, high-profile restaurants and merchandise. So it makes sense that they are expanding their presence on the Internet -- hoping to broaden their audience and to sell their products. Paul Prudhomme, restaurateur of K-Paul's, author of eight cookbooks and host of a PBS cooking series, operates his Web site, www.chefpaul.com, from the headquarters of his company, Magic Seasonings, in New Orleans. ''About 30 percent of our mail-order sales are from the Internet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For a chef, celebrity status equals brand-name recognition -- a critical asset in marketing products. But navigating the choppy seas of the Web can be tricky, especially for a small retailer of specialty items. According to Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., food is a tiny part of the online market. In 1999, consumers spent $1.1 billion on online grocery shopping -- a category that includes food, beverages and household supplies -- which is a fraction of the $400 billion in total supermarket sales. Because this category has enormous potential for growth, however, Forrester predicts that the online figures will soar by 2004.</p>
        <p>''A site is an obvious place for a chef to sell ingredients, gourmet meals and kitchen utensils, but being an online retailer is very expensive,'' said Evie Black Dykema, a Forrester analyst. ''It takes a very big name and sharp partnerships to pull it off. The best solution for chefs is to focus on what they do best, which is generating content, and then partner with a retailer who will uphold their brand name.''</p>
        <p>Some chefs are testing the waters slowly. Bobby Flay, host of the Food Network's ''Hot Off the Grill'' and ''Food Nation,'' owner of Mesa Grill and Bolo restaurants in Manhattan and author of ''Bobby Flay's Boy Meets Grill,'' is featured on the Food Network's site and on www.starchefs.com, but he does not have his own site. ''Running a site is a full-time job, and I don't have the manpower right now to do that,'' Mr. Flay said. ''I think the Internet is the most important invention since the television, but there have been a lot of ups and downs, so I'm just sort of waiting it out to see how it all goes.''</p>
        <p>Other chefs are also playing the waiting game.</p>
        <p>''The technology is moving so fast it seems there's something different every six months,'' said Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the owner of nine restaurants, including Jean Georges, Vong and Mercer Kitchen, all in New York, and a co-author of ''Jean-Georges: Cooking at Home with a Four-Star Chef.'' His site, www.jean-georges.com, is being revamped. ''I want to have sound, music, a little animation,'' he said. ''Right now we showcase products, but we will be selling. I would also love to have live cameras so we can show the chefs cooking in the kitchen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Prudhomme's site is also being upgraded. ''We'll be doing video streaming early next year, and we'll do chat rooms,'' he said. ''We want to make it more interactive, but we wanted to wait until we understood how to do it.''</p>
        <p>Most chefs realize that the potential of the Web has yet to be tapped. ''Later on down the road, it's going to get a lot more interesting as interactive television rolls out,'' said Ms. Dykema of Forrester. ''That's the real play for these guys.''</p>
        <p>''Eventually,'' she added, ''we'll be able to watch the Food Channel, click on a recipe and have it sent to our computer via e-mail, have products downloaded into our Web-band grocery cart via e-mail and buy online when the show is over.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Flay agreed. ''I think it's all going to meld together. You'll turn on your TV and you'll go to the Web -- it will just be in one box.''</p>
        <p>Another chef who is biding his time is Ming Tsai, a restaurateur and host of the Food Network's ''East Meets West'' and a new show called ''Ming's Quest.'' ''Everyone keeps telling me how great the Web is,'' said Mr. Tsai, whose site, www.ming.com, sells products like his signature knives. (He is also featured on the Food Network site.) ''But what percent of people really use it, maybe 10 to 20 percent? And what percent of those people have broadband or D.S.L.? Having said that, in three to five years it's going to be an incredible tool.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagasse said: ''There's no question that it's coming. We've only just begun with this.''</p>
        <p>Speaking of the future, will the public's fascination with all things culinary continue? Or is it just a fad?</p>
        <p>''I think the trend will keep growing,'' Mr. Boulud said. ''People are passionate about food.'' Mr. Tsai added: ''I think it will continue. Don't forget that the United States is playing catch-up to Europe and Asia, where food has always been the focus.''</p>
        <p>Still, when it comes to buying food online, the touch-and-feel factor is a big issue, which raises the question of whether chefs shop online.</p>
        <p>''Our sommelier buys a lot of wine through the Internet,'' Mr. Boulud noted.</p>
        <p>''I buy books but not food,'' Mr. Flay said.</p>
        <p>''Do I buy food online?'' Mr. Vongerichten said with a chuckle. ''No. Not yet. I still like to go to the market.''</p>
