        <p>FOR decades, Hollywood talent agents used the phone and a brash style to make deals for clients. Talent agencies focused their energies on signing up actors, writers and directors and finding jobs for them in films and television.</p>
        <p>Times have changed. The agents are still brash. But a new breed has emerged over the last few years that is less interested in schmoozing with stars and studio and television executives. In fact, these agents are spending far more time in Silicon Valley than in the San Fernando Valley, where Warner Brothers, Walt Disney and Universal make their films and TV shows.</p>

        <p>FOR decades, Hollywood talent agents used the phone and a brash style to make deals for clients. Talent agencies focused their energies on signing up actors, writers and directors and finding jobs for them in films and television.</p>
        <p>Times have changed. The agents are still brash. But a new breed has emerged over the last few years that is less interested in schmoozing with stars and studio and television executives. In fact, these agents are spending far more time in Silicon Valley than in the San Fernando Valley, where Warner Brothers, Walt Disney and Universal make their films and TV shows.</p>
        <p>''The real issue is how the two communities, Silicon Valley and Hollywood, play into each other,'' said Dan Adler, who runs the new media division of the Creative Artists Agency, an increasingly powerful unit that has grown to about 15 agents from three in a year.</p>
        <p>''Each of them offers remarkably complementary assets, tools, ideas,'' he said. ''The issue is, can they each fully appreciate and fully leverage what the other one offers in terms of helping Hollywood tell stories better or helping technology reach a broader audience?''</p>
        <p>Not far from the sleek headquarters of Creative Artists in Beverly Hills, John Mass, a vice president for new media at the William Morris Agency, said: ''There's a growing understanding of the assets of each community and what each brings to the table. Going forward, people in the entertainment community will look at technology not just in how it enhances existing content but how new forms of content might be created with the new technology.''</p>
        <p>Virtually every talent agency in Hollywood is reaching out to the Internet -- either by making deals for their clients to produce material for the Web or advising high-technology and other companies seeking ties to  the entertainment business.</p>
        <p>William Morris and Creative Artists dominate the field, each with an expanding separate division that works hand in hand with traditional agents. A third agency, Endeavor, has also begun moving energetically into Internet business.</p>
        <p>''We've said to our clients, 'We want to make sure you're educated in what's going on now and what's coming down the pike,' '' said Lon Rosen, the chief of the new media division at Endeavor. Adam Sandler, David Spade and Jon Lovitz, as well as Larry David, who helped create ''Seinfeld,'' are among the Endeavor clients who are creating content for Internet sites.</p>
        <p>Thus far, however, Hollywood's overhyped plunge into the Internet world has been troubled. Earlier this month, Pop.com, an entertainment site that was introduced with fanfare last October and had the backing of Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, as well as the director Ron Howard and the producer Brian Grazer, virtually closed shop. Most of the company's 80 employees were laid off after the live-action and animation site failed to find a buyer.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the high-profile site Shockwave.com, which had spent millions of dollars on deals with filmmakers like Tim Burton, James L. Brooks, David Lynch and the team of Matt Stone and Trey Parker, announced it laying off some workers in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The company indicated it would focus more of its attention on online games and slow the pace of its high-priced celebrity contracts.</p>
        <p>But these and other setbacks are hardly deterring talent agents.</p>
        <p>William Morris, which has taken the most aggressive approach to new technology, began its new media division eight years ago, more than an epoch on Web time. Several Morris agents had become fascinated with the Internet and asked the agency's leadership to explore its potential for entertainment. The unit, with about 15 people now, is led by Mr. Mass, Johnny Levin, Lewis Henderson and Paul Bricault.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mass said the agency's role was to ''seek out new and different distribution channels for our clients and serve as navigators in the entertainment business for companies, similar to what we do for writers, actors, directors and producers.''</p>
        <p>Morris sought not only to link its stars and directors to Internet sites but also, far more lucratively, to help  high-technology and other companies establish links with the entertainment industry. ''Ten years ago, these new companies, whether it was Cisco or Sun Microsystems, didn't really see themselves in the entertainment business,'' Mr. Levin said. ''Now many of them do. We can advise them.</p>
        <p>''A lot of corporate America was compartmentalized,'' he added. ''You were in the movie business. Or the television business. Or you made cell phones. Or you were in the Internet business. All these lines are getting convoluted now. You can have diverse, unrelated entities coming together through the portal of the talent agency.''</p>
        <p>So along with Sophia Loren, Regis Philbin and Whoopi Goldberg, the agency's business clients now include Anheuser-Busch, British Telecommunications, Lucent Technologies, Nokia and Texas Instruments. The agency has established a significant relationship between two clients, Anheuser-Busch and Broadband Sports, in which the beer company became the largest advertiser on Broadband's Web site.</p>
        <p>In the last year, the agency has also worked with eBay to move offline into the worlds of publishing, retailing and television.</p>
        <p>''A lot of books are being written about antiques, a lot of publications are addressing the issue of collectibles, and the most popular series on PBS is 'Antiques Roadshow,' '' Mr. Mass said. ''Those are eBay enthusiasts. And we are trying to help them extend their brand through traditional media.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, the agency helped connect eBay to another client, the Mills Corporation, one of the biggest mall developers in the United States. One result has been that eBay promotes itself at malls nationwide. Morris has also been hired by British Telecom to help provide films, games and other entertainments for the company's new Internet site in Britain.</p>
        <p>Unlike William Morris, where the emphasis appears to be on corporate clients and new media companies, Creative Artists' central strategy focuses on shaping Internet-related deals for clients. With his partners Johnny Knoxville and Jeff Tremaine, Spike Jonze, who directed ''Being John Malkovich,'' has created an offbeat comedy project, ''Jackass,'' that has been picked up by MTV. Oliver Stone and the action producer Jerry Bruckheimer have signed deals with Z.com, which offers short films and live action and animation on its site. Cindy Crawford has signed a deal with eStyle to sell, among other things, clothes for young children. Two other Creative Artists' clients, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, who have accompanied Mr. Adler to Silicon Valley several times and to the M.I.T. Media Lab in Cambridge, Mass., are building their own Internet company, which will also produce television shows.</p>
        <p>Other clients working with Mr. Adler on Internet deals include Will Smith, Nicolas Cage and Sarah Jessica Parker. Media companies represented by Creative Artists include iPix, eStyle, Extend Media and TiVo.</p>
        <p>For Hollywood agencies that are dealing with the Internet, Mr. Adler said, flux is the norm. ''There are no standard business models, there's no finite list of players; it's ever-changing,'' he said. ''There's no vernacular everyone is sharing. There's a lot more chaos in front of us, and in front of our clients. Frankly, we're all in a business that we don't fully understand, where the business models may change tomorrow. That's what makes it an adventure.''</p>
