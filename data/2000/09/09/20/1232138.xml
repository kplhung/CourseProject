        <p>The microphone was burning, the telephone switchboard was flashing and this time it was Victor Correa on the line to Radio Ecclesia, 97.5 on the FM dial. And the three government officials taking calls in the studio braced themselves for yet another public whaling.</p>
        <p>''All of you opposition politicians, you sit there and do nothing!'' bristled the angry voice of Mr. Correa, whose call was broadcast live across this shabby capital one recent morning. ''You receive orders from the government. You do nothing on your own. I ask you one favor: can you please stop driving expensive cars and play the role of a real opposition?''</p>
        <p>The officials -- opposition members who are part of a national unity government -- shifted uncomfortably, unaccustomed to the verbal flogging, which would have been unthinkable only a year ago. In this war-riven country, where public dissent is typically suppressed, Radio Ecclesia is one of only a handful of independent media outlets willing to challenge a government that is increasingly criticized for corruption and incompetence.</p>
        <p>But this daring has come at a price. Moving to sharply restrict the operations of independent news media like Radio Ecclesia, the government has now proposed legislation that would send journalists to prison for criticizing or questioning government officials.</p>
        <p>Under the proposed law, journalists who publish or transmit news or facts ''which attack the honor'' of government officials or offend ''public morals and good habits'' could be imprisoned for two to eight years. The news media would also need government approval to operate and the authorities would be allowed to seize and ban publications at their discretion.</p>
        <p>The government of President Jose Eduardo dos Santos had already stirred an international outcry during the last year by searching newsrooms, seizing audio tapes and unpublished articles and arresting, detaining and intimidating journalists who work for independent or foreign news outlets.</p>
        <p>Journalists say the new law would make it impossible for them to do their jobs and would violate their constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression. And Radio Ecclesia, which has continued to operate despite repeated harassment, would probably have to revamp its format to survive.</p>
        <p>Radio Ecclesia, the country's only independent radio station, is run by the Catholic Church here. And last year, three of its journalists were arrested for broadcasting an interview with Jonas Savimbi, the leader of the rebels in this country's long-running civil war.</p>
        <p>In June the station's director was kidnapped and fired on by armed gunmen after he broadcast live a debate on how the country's oil and diamond resources were fueling the civil war.</p>
        <p>''I was shaking,'' the director, the Rev. Jose Paulo, said of the kidnapping. ''This law is just another tool to repress journalists. A lot of people are afraid of this. It's very bad for democracy in this country.''</p>
        <p>The crackdown here is just one of several across southern Africa, a region known for more stable democracies and a respect for human rights:</p>
        <p>*In Zimbabwe, two journalists from the independent weekly newspaper The Standard were jailed and tortured last year for reporting on an alleged military plot against President Robert Mugabe.</p>
        <p>*In Zambia, 11 journalists from the independent daily The Post were charged with espionage for reporting assessments that Zambia could not withstand an attack from Angola.</p>
        <p>*In South Africa, usually hailed as a model of press freedom, the Human Rights Commission issued subpoenas to newspaper editors in an effort to compel them to testify about racism in the media.</p>
        <p>In a letter to the leadership of the Southern African Development Community, which represents 14 countries, the Committee to Protect Journalists also reported harassment in Swaziland, Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique. But the committee singled out President dos Santos as one of 10 worst enemies of the press.</p>
        <p>''Journalists are very, very cornered in Angola,'' said Yves Sorokobi, the Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, a New-York based group that has sharply criticized the legislation. ''This new law will make it almost completely impossible to talk about politics.''</p>
        <p>''Journalists will continue to maintain some sort of independent voice, but they will make sure not to cross the strict lines that have been defined,'' Mr. Sorokobi said in a telephone interview from New York. ''There will be an incredible amount of self-censorship. The way Angola is run today, anything can happen.''</p>
        <p>Officials here have acknowledged that their review of the press law is ''by its very nature controversial and sensitive.'' And the government has taken the unusual step of inviting journalists and others to voice their opinions on the legislation, which is expected to become law by year's end.</p>
        <p>''It is very important to understand that what was presented was just a draft,'' Hendrik Vaal Neto, the minister of communications, said in an interview. ''We want a democratic discussion of the proposed law. Freedom of information is a very important factor in a democracy. What we intend to do is to find a law that everybody can accept so that we will avoid trouble in the future.''</p>
        <p>But journalists here say the government abuses the existing law.</p>
        <p>In the most widely publicized case, Rafael Marques, 29, was convicted of defamation in March after an article in which he described President dos Santos as a dictator. Mr. Marques was sentenced to six months in prison, pending the outcome of an appeal.</p>
        <p>Andre Domingos Mussamo, 28, the chief editor of a provincial office of the state-controlled radio, was detained for almost four months after the police searched his home and office and discovered an unpublished article he had written for an independent newspaper about security preparations for a rebel attack. He was acquitted in May.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neto defended the arrests, saying the news media are inevitably under tougher scrutiny because the country is at war. ''We are fighting Jonas Savimbi, so you don't put Jonas Savimbi on the radio,'' Mr. Neto said, referring to the Radio Ecclesia interview.</p>
        <p>The government pressure has already had a chilling effect. Radio Ecclesia stopped broadcasting a weekly radio show on Africa after the government objected last year. Other journalists say they now think carefully before they write.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domingos Mussamo's relatives are begging him to give up his work for the independent press. As a result of his arrest, he was fired from his job at the radio station, where he earned $7 a month and supported a wife and two children.</p>
        <p>And while he says he will continue to do freelance work for the independent media, he admits that he will now have to find other means of support. ''I have to find a way to feed my family,'' he said. ''I have to find a job.''</p>
