        <p>IN an old brick roadhouse on the fading edge of downtown Reno, Chris Smither poured out his soul on a small stage. The audience that had crammed into Big Ed's bar and restaurant sat rapt as Mr. Smither growled and sang country blues, picking polyphonic patterns on a steel-string guitar and stomping his feet on the wood floor to keep time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smither creates a world inside his music. So he was oblivious to the  camera overhead that reduced the intimate scene to a flickering postage stamp image on a computer screen and sent it on to the vast World Wide Web beyond.</p>

        <p>IN an old brick roadhouse on the fading edge of downtown Reno, Chris Smither poured out his soul on a small stage. The audience that had crammed into Big Ed's bar and restaurant sat rapt as Mr. Smither growled and sang country blues, picking polyphonic patterns on a steel-string guitar and stomping his feet on the wood floor to keep time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smither creates a world inside his music. So he was oblivious to the  camera overhead that reduced the intimate scene to a flickering postage stamp image on a computer screen and sent it on to the vast World Wide Web beyond.</p>
        <p>A Web camera has become commonplace in the places Mr. Smither plays. The Internet has become part of his life, his music and his business, and his own Web site, www.smither .com, also connects him more closely to his fans. But there are times when he prefers not to think about all that, especially when he is performing for a live audience.</p>
        <p>''They're just an extension of these people,'' he said of his Web audience, gesturing around the packed room and glancing at the computer on the bar. ''They just don't have as good seats.''</p>
        <p>On vacation at her parents' home in Maui, Hawaii, Debbie Grooms, a longtime fan of the singer and a Big Ed's regular, had the best seat in the house, right in front of her father's computer. As she watched Mr. Smither's herky-jerky image play her favorite songs, her parents laughed and her teenage daughter rolled her eyes. But despite a few glitches, computer freezes and reboots, Ms. Grooms was satisfied.</p>
        <p>''It was awesome,'' she said. ''He did all the songs I wanted to hear. It's still better to be there live. But if you can't get there, it's pretty neat to be able to watch in the comfort of your home.'' Big Ed's, which Webcasts music every Tuesday night at www.bigedswebsite.com, is a small part of a huge explosion of live music on the Internet.</p>
        <p>On any given day, fans can click on to performances from dozens of clubs hooked up to www.digitalclub network.com, including the Knitting Factory in New York, one of the first clubs to go live online. Every evening at 6 Eastern time, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington offers live Webcasts of an eclectic mix of free performances of music, dance and theater from its Millennium Stage at www.kennedy-center.org. The House of Blues, a nightclub chain, archives more slickly produced shows online at www.hob.com. And while these ventures are taking live music from real settings to the Web, the online music company Riffage.com is meeting them halfway: it plunked down several million dollars of its $25 million in venture capital to buy the venerable Great American Music Hall in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>That's just scratching the surface. Despite the often shaky quality of most live music presentations on the Web, and despite the fact that no one seems to have figured out how to make much money in such presentations, live music is a big part of the expanding pipeline of broadband online entertainment. The producers of a live Webcast by Paul McCartney from the tiny Cavern Club in Liverpool, England, reported drawing 3.5 million viewers last year, placing it among the top live Webcasts ever, alongside such fare as a Victoria's Secret fashion show and a Drew Carey comedy show.</p>
        <p>''People are going online for entertainment,'' said Idil Cakim, a media analyst with Cyber Quest in New York. Seven of 10 adult Internet users visit entertainment sites, according to Cyber Quest surveys, and 36 percent visit music sites. Internet users are also increasingly tuning into live events online, Ms. Cakim said. Among the 72 million adult Internet users in the United States, 12 million have watched a live event online in the last three months.</p>
        <p>FOR now, fans like Ms. Grooms seem willing to forgive the fits and starts because they feel part of the birth of a new way of experiencing music. And club owners, promoters and musicians seem willing to survive on more traditional revenue, like sales of tickets, drinks and compact discs, while hoping to benefit from the additional buzz of putting shows online.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice to break even or turn a profit,'' said Jeffrey M. Cotton, who has invested about $10,000 in the Big Ed's Web site as a sideline to the bar and restaurant, which is owned by his wife, Sheila, and her business partner, Bruce Van Dyke, a local radio disc jockey. So far, Mr. Cotton estimated, Big Ed's Web site has not helped sell any more hamburgers and beer, but it has received more local exposure and attracted virtual visitors from as far away as Norway.</p>
        <p>Live music is growing quickly on the Web mainly because it is so easy to put online. In Big Ed's, and in dozens of similar small clubs across the country in the Digital Club Network, just one camera is pointed at the stage. The sound and image are routed through a personal computer to compress and encode the signal and then routed to another personal computer, which acts as a server, connecting directly to the Internet and making the show available to up to 2,000 Web users anywhere in the world. Viewers see a tiny image, which changes every 5 to 10 seconds like a slide show. Picture quality is sacrificed so that users can get decent sound from basic modem connections.</p>
        <p>But the inherent demand for higher quality sound and pictures is also driving Internet users to seek faster Internet connections, like digital subscriber lines or cable modems. And it is pushing producers to juggle the immediate need to put something live online that most people can hear and see even with slow modem connections while preparing for a future when more people will have broadband access and can expect better transmissions.</p>
        <p>''It's not ideal in terms of the quality of the picture,'' said Lawrence J. Wilker, the president of the Kennedy Center, about its daily live Webcasts. ''You can see the stop-start jerky motion and the picture is grainy. But as narrow turns to broadband, that will change rapidly.''</p>
        <p>The Kennedy Center began Webcasting performances in 1998. ''We started getting e-mails from people all over the world saying, 'We'd like to see more,' '' Mr. Wilker said. ''It got so popular we decided to do it every single night.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilker also began thinking about bringing live performances of all kinds to the Internet. This summer, he announced that he was leaving the Kennedy Center to start a company called ShowOnDemand.com, which will produce motion-picture quality performances of music, theater and dance for the broadband Internet channels he thinks will be widely available in three to four years.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Kennedy Center broadcasts, which are more akin to Big Ed's single-camera, shoestring approach, Mr. Wilker and his new partners plan to produce live events and record them using the more traditional broadcasting approach of multiple cameras. ''We believe we need the high-quality picture and sound,'' he said. The programs will also be edited.</p>
        <p>ShowOnDemand.com has an archive of close to 15,000 performances and 17 million feet of videotape, which will be used as raw material to create entire shows and supplement new productions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilker said that the company was confident there would be demand for such broadband programming and that revenue would most likely come from a mix of subscriptions, pay-per-view programs and syndications. ''It's a little early in the life of the Web to tell what will be most profitable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>At the Knitting Factory in New York, ''old media has helped pay the way for the new media,'' said Michael Dorf, the president and chief executive of KnitMedia, an expanding empire of nightclubs that owns the Factory and clubs in Hollywood and Berlin as well as multimedia ventures that include CD's, videos, television shows and live shows of avant-garde artists, which can be downloaded at www.knitmedia.com.</p>
        <p>Webcasts of live shows have not been profitable for the Knitting Factory, which went online in 1995. Indeed, television syndication deals have brought in the money needed to help improve the production values of online shows, Mr. Dorf said, adding that people are not spending money to watch live music on the Web yet. KnitMedia has earned about as much money from downloads of its archived shows as it has from a few weeks of beer sales at its club in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''It's supply and demand,'' Mr. Dorf said. ''It's really not too brain-sciency. The only way I can take a ticket at the door is to give people something they can't get for free. If every other club in L.A., or God forbid, New York, was not charging money at the door'' he said he would have ''a hard time charging 20 bucks.''</p>
        <p>Right now, live music on the Web is virtually all free. Mr. Dorf and others Webcast to attract traffic, hoping to sell more compact discs and T-shirts, and most important, to lure more people into their clubs.</p>
        <p>That model seems to be working for Mr. Smither as he lugs his guitar from town to town to play the blues in clubs like Big Ed's. He jokes about the Internet. ''It's not something you can avoid,'' he said. ''It's how they steal everything.''</p>
        <p>But the Web has been good for his career, he said. ''Nothing in a Webcast will keep people from coming to see me. Just the opposite. If they sample my music on the Internet, they'll come to a show. If they come to a show, they'll buy everything I've got.'' Between sets, the crowd at Big Ed's swarmed around him to buy CD's of his music and have them autographed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smither sells about 30,000 albums a year and depends on live performances and sales of CD's to make a living. The Internet has helped him fill small places in towns where he has never performed before, and he has an e-mail list of 15,000 people whom he notifies about his shows on the Web and who come from miles around.</p>
        <p>''It allows me to maintain something of a one-on-one connection with my fan base,'' he said. ''For somebody like me, it's crucial to maintain that contact.''</p>
