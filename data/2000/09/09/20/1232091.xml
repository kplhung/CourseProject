        <p>''Citius, altius, fortius,'' read the words over the players' entrance at the New South Wales tennis center, and even though Venus Williams was no faster, higher or stronger than usual in the first Olympic tennis match of her career, she was still too much for her first-round opponent Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia.</p>
        <p>Williams won her 27th match in a row, this one in slightly less than an hour by the score of 6-2, 6-2, and even though Nagyova hustled and did her earnest utmost to counter Williams's superior power and self-confidence, the outcome was a foregone conclusion. The absence of drama might help explain why Venus's sister and Olympic doubles partner, Serena, yawned late in the second set as she watched from the stands next to Billie Jean King, the American women's coach.</p>
        <p>While tennis remains a relatively minor Olympic sport, the Williams sisters are a major Olympic attraction. After Friday night's opening ceremony, they were surrounded by dozens of autograph-seeking, photograph-seeking athletes. Meanwhile, Marion Jones, the world's fastest woman, who hopes to win five gold medals in track and field here, was standing nearby and not generating any hysteria.</p>
        <p>But the Williamses are hardly the only tennis players attracting stargazers. Christophe Pognon, a 22-year-old from the tiny West African nation of Benin, played the Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten in the first round today, and after he had lost, 6-1, 6-1, in just 38 minutes, he asked a ball boy to take a picture of him with Kuerten, the two-time French Open champion from Brazil.</p>
        <p>''What a thrill,'' said Pognon, who received a wild-card entry into the Olympics but has no ATP points to his name and is ranked outside the top 300 in France, the country where he trains.</p>
        <p>But Pognon will always be an Olympian, and so will the top Australian men's singles players -- Patrick Rafter, Lleyton Hewitt and Mark Philippoussis -- who are the main explanations for the Australian fans' level of interest in this Olympic tournament. Approximately 171,000 tickets have been sold for the 10-day event, and no more tickets are expected to be made available.</p>
        <p>Rafter played and won on center court earlier today, defeating the American Vince Spadea, 6-4, 6-3, and generating the sort of enthusiasm from fans that is usually associated with winning tournaments, not winning first-round matches.</p>
        <p>''It's very similar to Davis Cup, except you are not going to get another shot at proving yourself,'' said Rafter, who, like all his countrymen, is competing in a team jersey with Australia printed on the back. ''In Davis Cup, you are going to get another match or you've got your mate to fall back on.''</p>
        <p>The Australian players have not been the best of mates of late. The long-running contretemps between Rafter and Philippoussis over the latter's irresolute commitment to Davis Cup for Australia reached the crisis stage again in July, when Philippoussis withdrew from the semifinals against Brazil.</p>
        <p>But both Rafter and Philippoussis, who defeated Thomas Johansson, 7-6 (6), 6-4, today, indicated that the tension between them had dissipated in Sydney although they had not yet addressed the rift directly. ''But we are getting along very well,'' Rafter said. ''I really hope that we will sit down and maybe talk about the differences, because Mark is a good kid, and we all know that.''</p>
        <p>While Rafter and Philippoussis were cruising, Todd Martin, the American who reached the semifinals at the United States Open earlier this month, was crushed, 6-2, 6-0, by Rainer Schuttler of Germany.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I was flat, but that flatness became extremely flat as I watched him chase down pretty good shots, and pass me point after point,'' Martin said. ''It's a pretty long way to come for 14 games.''</p>
        <p>It is also difficult to peak twice in the same month, and it will be intriguing to see how the new United States Open men's singles champion, Marat Safin, will fare after playing and winning in a minor tournament in Tashkent the week after the United States Open. Safin arrived in Sydney via Bangkok at 5 a.m. today, and by lunchtime he was jokingly staggering toward a practice court at Homebush.</p>
        <p>''Sure I'm tired, but tennis is my job,'' said Safin, the Russian Olympian. ''If I don't play my best here, I will have to kill myself.''</p>
        <p>Venus Williams, the new United States Open women's champion, should be quite a bit fresher, and if she handles the tournament as smoothly as she handled her post-match interview tonight, she may soon have a medal around her neck. She was asked to respond to John McEnroe's latest jab that she and her sister were ''cold as ice,'' disrespectful and unfriendly to other players.</p>
        <p>''I don't know John McEnroe,'' she answered. ''I've never had a conversation with him. He doesn't know me. So I find it difficult to form an opinion on someone that I don't know, and I find it difficult that he has formed an opinion on myself and my sister, seeing he doesn't know us.''</p>
