        <p>Actress Cautions Against Her Movie</p>

        <p>Actress Cautions Against Her Movie</p>
        <p>JAMIE LEE CURTIS'S ubiquitousness caught up with her yesterday, and she was not pleased.</p>
        <p>Ms. Curtis -- actress, children's book author and cellular-service pitchwoman -- was presiding over a reading group at Public School 126, the Jacob Riis Community School, at 80 Catherine Street on the Lower East Side. The plan was for her to read her latest book, ''Where Do Balloons Go? An Uplifting Mystery'' (HarperCollins).</p>
        <p>The third graders sitting cross-legged on the floor applauded when she finished. Then it was ask-the-author time, and after a round of the usual questions and the usual answers -- ''I didn't think I'd be an author, I just wrote down something funny'' -- a boy in the front row said he had seen her in one of her films. Specifically, ''Halloween,'' the 1978 horror hit.</p>
        <p>''You're not supposed to see that movie,'' Ms. Curtis said. ''It's not appropriate.''</p>
        <p>Later, after leaving the school, she said that she had been careful not to repeat the name of the film -- she did not want others in the class to go home and ask, ''Mommy, can we watch 'Halloween' tonight?''</p>
        <p>''When an 8-year-old says he's been exposed to that level of violence, it makes me question the minds of the people raising that child,'' she said. But she also said, ''I also don't think there should be restrictions on making films like 'Halloween.' ''</p>
        <p>Back to other questions from the third graders. She said that she wrote her first book (''Today I Feel Silly and Other Moods That Make My Day,'' which she also read aloud yesterday) in less than an hour and then spent a year revising it.</p>
        <p>The next question was mumbled.</p>
        <p>'' 'I look younger on TV,' is that what you said?'' she asked. ''Or 'different,' and I just heard 'younger'?''</p>
        <p>Rally Must Go On</p>
        <p>The actor WILLIAM BALDWIN, who is also the president of the Creative Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group representing the arts and entertainment fields, did not get to deliver his five-page speech at a campaign finance rally at the United States Capitol yesterday. His shuttle flight from New York was late.</p>
        <p>''I got rained out,'' he said. ''We got held on the runway at La Guardia for two hours.'' He finally landed in Washington about 10 minutes after the rally ended.</p>
        <p>So he read the speech to an audience of one, over a cellular phone. For the record, Mr. Baldwin sounded about the same as in the movies.</p>
        <p>Not delivering the speech as planned was ''not the end of the world,'' he said. ''There always are other opportunities with campaign finance reform.''</p>
        <p>Swift Justice</p>
        <p>Sometimes, the wheels of justice don't grind so slowly. One day recently, GERARD E. LYNCH, then a law professor at Columbia University, was to appear in the United States Courthouse in Foley Square to be sworn in as a new federal judge.</p>
        <p>But at the last minute, he had to call CHIEF JUDGE MICHAEL B. MUKASEY to say he could not make it: a teacher had failed to appear for class, and he would have to fill in.</p>
        <p>No problem, Judge Mukasey said; he would stop by Columbia later that day. And so Professor Lynch took the oath in his quiet, book-strewn law school office.</p>
        <p>When Judge Lynch showed up for work a few days later, he entered his empty chambers and found himself surrounded by electricians, painters and carpenters. That afternoon, a lawyer, RAYMOND J. DOWD, arrived with the judge's first case -- the Green Party was seeking an injunction in an election case. The judge greeted the lawyer personally, read the papers and scheduled a hearing.</p>
        <p>It was held a few days later, with the judge issuing his first decision orally from the bench. (He denied the injunction.)</p>
        <p>But his day was not done.</p>
        <p>At 4 p.m., hundreds of well-wishers gathered in a spacious courtroom for a ceremonial swearing-in.</p>
        <p>As they watched, Judge Lynch took the oath (again) and put on the traditional black robe. Dozens of new cases have now been sent his way. ''We're at work,'' he said.</p>
