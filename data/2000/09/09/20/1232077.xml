        <p>SYRAH is a coming grape in the United States, and Washington is one of its hotbeds: more than 1,500 acres are planted with syrah vines. That's almost triple the acreage of a year ago, though well behind the more than 10,000 acres planted in California, where acreage is also rapidly increasing. But while syrah in California may always be overshadowed by chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon and the other big boys, it has a chance to make a name for itself in Washington, where the wine industry is not as established.</p>
        <p>The emergence of syrah is exciting because it is a versatile wine. It can be excellent in the northern Rhone Valley of France, where wines from Hermitage and Cote Rotie set standards for power and elegance. But in its less exalted forms, it can be a satisfying everyday red. Winemakers in the south of France are turning to syrah to improve a host of fairly inexpensive wines.</p>

        <p>SYRAH is a coming grape in the United States, and Washington is one of its hotbeds: more than 1,500 acres are planted with syrah vines. That's almost triple the acreage of a year ago, though well behind the more than 10,000 acres planted in California, where acreage is also rapidly increasing. But while syrah in California may always be overshadowed by chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon and the other big boys, it has a chance to make a name for itself in Washington, where the wine industry is not as established.</p>
        <p>The emergence of syrah is exciting because it is a versatile wine. It can be excellent in the northern Rhone Valley of France, where wines from Hermitage and Cote Rotie set standards for power and elegance. But in its less exalted forms, it can be a satisfying everyday red. Winemakers in the south of France are turning to syrah to improve a host of fairly inexpensive wines.</p>
        <p>Americans used to insipid merlots may find syrahs just as easy to drink, yet with more substance. While syrah rarely has the tannic bite of cabernet sauvignon, it often has more depth than merlot.</p>
        <p>The American style of syrah is as different from the Rhone style as American pinot noirs are from Burgundies. Most Washington syrahs I've tasted are sweet, fruity and forward, easier to enjoy young than the French wines, which seem more spicy and woodsy than fruity. Conversely, Washington syrahs are not as gushingly sweet and fruity as Australian syrahs, which are called shiraz there. Washington syrahs are still in relative infancy; much remains to be learned about them. How will they age? Will vintages change as vines mature? They are not easy to find, but that should soon change. Of the vintages available, the 1998's are softer and fruitier than the 1997's, which may have more potential.</p>
        <p>MCCREA CELLARS, YAKIMA VALLEY 1998: $35.</p>
        <p>Lush but spicy; gets richer and deeper as it breathes.</p>
        <p>CAYUSE VINEYARDS, WALLA WALLA VALLEY 1998: $29.  Concentrated and sweet; firm tannins but velvety texture.</p>
        <p>GLEN FIONA, COLUMBIA VALLEY, BACCHUS VINEYARD 1998: $28.</p>
        <p>Rich aromas; smooth and fruity.</p>
        <p>COLUMBIA WINERY, YAKIMA VALLEY 1998: $18.</p>
        <p>Ripe and round with complex aromas and soft tannins.</p>
        <p>COLUMBIA CREST, RESERVE, COLUMBIA VALLEY 1998: $27.</p>
        <p>Sweet, fruity, soft and forward.</p>
