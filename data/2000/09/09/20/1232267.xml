        <p>Last September, we asked listed some shoppers' favorite sites, and profiled some new e-businesses. Some of them are revisted in this section.</p>
        <p>Judy McGrath  President, MTV: Musictelevision and MTV2</p>
        <p>Google.com -- the best and fastest search tool. You can type anything: ''oxygen,'' ''my mother,'' and it takes you instantly to what you need.</p>
        <p>Heavy.com, Atomfilms.com, Mediatrip.com, Ifilm.com -- I like animation. I've always been a fan of ''The Angry Kid.'' Heavy.com has a new one, ''Jomeo and Ruliet'' that's really fun. IFilm.com has ''George Lucas in Love,'' which is kind of an ongoing story about George Lucas having writer's block. These sites, I think, are really the start of something new. I like the feeling that you're watching an art form in its infancy. You find yourself rooting for these guys.</p>
        <p>360HipHop.com -- With the political season upon us, I've been looking more and more at 360HipHop.com, Russell Simmons's site. They're starting to do a lot of political stuff for younger kids that makes you interested in what's going on right now.</p>
        <p>NextMonet.com -- There's a great range of art here by some new emerging artists that are more reasonably priced than art in a gallery. It makes you feel as if you can buy and have art in your house and it gives you a feel for the new stuff that's out there.</p>
        <p>Radio.sonicnet.com -- Since I don't really go to clubs much anymore, Radio.sonicnet.com is a great way to have a vicarious club experience. You can hear all the latest stuff the top DJ's are playing.</p>
        <p>Adam Powell Jr.  Vice president, technology and programs, the Freedom Forum.</p>
        <p>Amazon.com -- I'm still a happy Amazon.com user. Although probably to Jeff Bezos's chagrin, I still just buy books.</p>
        <p>UAL.com -- It's remarkable how many of these travel sites cannot deliver the final goods. It seems impossible to get to the final step of buying the ticket, except at the United Airlines site, UAL.com. Once, to my amazement, they gave me the price of their ticket as $800, but at the bottom of the screen in red letters it said you may also want to try these less expensive tickets. They were cheaper flights from competing airlines!</p>
        <p>Naomi Nari Nan  1999 United States Figure Skating Championship Silver Medalist, 15 years old</p>
        <p>Bebe and Armani Exchange -- I also like to browse at Bebe (www.bebe.com), a fashion store in LA. They have trends and what's hot right now. I go to Armani Exchange (www.armaniexchange.com) to look at clothes. The clothes there are really cool. I can't really buy anything because my parents won't let me have a credit card yet, which is a good thing -- I would do a lot of damage.</p>
        <p>CdNow and MusicBoulevard -- I still use CdNow (www.cdnow.com) for my favorite bands like 'N Sync, the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears, as well as classical music for my skating programs.</p>
