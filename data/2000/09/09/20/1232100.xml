        <p>Honor Bound  The dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham has won this year's $250,000 Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize. He is to receive the honor, which also includes a silver medallion, in a ceremony on Oct. 18 at the Hudson Theater on West 44th Street in Manhattan. The artist Robert Rauschenberg will deliver the introductory remarks.</p>
        <p>Hello, Again  The New York Philharmonic, playing works by Mozart, Richard Strauss and Mendelssohn, with the soprano Kiri Te Kanawa joining it for the first time since 1986, begins its 159th season at 8 tonight at Avery Fisher Hall. The concert, with Kurt Masur conducting, ushers in a Mendelssohn festival, which includes the orchestra's first performances of the composer's ''St. Paul'' oratorio. Mr. Masur studied at the Leipzig Conservatory, which Mendelssohn founded, and, like him, led the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.</p>

        <p>Executive Decisions  Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Madison, Roosevelt (Theodore and Franklin), Kennedy and Nixon star in a show that opens on Sunday at the Baltimore Museum of Art. So do architects like Eric Gugler, Benjamin Henry Latrobe, Pierre-Charles L'Enfant and Charles McKim; portrait painters like Ralph Earl, John Vanderlyn and Aaron Shikler; the photographer Annie Leibovitz; and landscape, interior and fashion designers. Running through Jan. 7, the exhibition is called ''Power, Politics and Style: Art for the Presidents.'' It features 100 objects from 15 presidents, including a drawing illustrating Washington's vision of the ''presidential palace'' that became the White House. The show tells how presidents have used furnishings, fashion and portraits to carry their messages to the nation.</p>
        <p>For a Cause  Andre Previn will join the Juilliard String Quartet in performing the Mozart Piano Quartet. The mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves will sing operatic selections. The 22-year-old vocalist Jane Monheit will sing jazz. The soprano Evelyn Lear will perform a vocal narrative. Joan Kwuon will be the soloist. Mandy Patinkin will be master of ceremonies. All will participate at 7:30 on Friday night in Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 3 in G, with Mr. Previn conducting the Prometheus Chamber Orchestra. Inspired by Ms. Kwuon's bout with breast cancer, the program benefits breast cancer research at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center, where she was set on the road to recovery. Tickets range from $30 to $100.</p>
