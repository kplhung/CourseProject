        <p>Government officials suggested today that the new supplemental budget to be announced on Wednesday would increase public expenditures in the current fiscal year by three trillion to four trillion yen, or $28 billion to $37.4 billion at current exchange rates.

        <p>The Japanese government is preparing yet another package of supplemental spending aimed at propping up the economy, which has failed to gain enough momentum on its own despite several previous injections of money.</p>
        <p>Government officials suggested today that the new supplemental budget to be announced on Wednesday would increase public expenditures in the current fiscal year by three trillion to four trillion yen, or $28 billion to $37.4 billion at current exchange rates. They said the so-called headline amount might exceed 10 trillion yen, or $94 billion, with the inclusion of credit guarantees for small businesses, tax breaks for home buyers and other programs that do not require cash outlays.</p>
        <p>Japan is already the world's largest debtor, and the new package will add further liabilities to be financed. Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit rating on Japanese government bonds for the second time in two years, concerned about the country's rapidly growing debt load.</p>
        <p>This year's record 85 trillion yen budget -- currently $795 billion -- had been intended to ensure against the need for further spending. But as the public works appropriations in the last supplemental budget were exhausted, and support for the governing Liberal Democratic Party plummeted, politicians decided that additional spending was necessary to protect the country's off-again-on-again economic recovery.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, their concern about further swelling the government's liabilities was clear today, reflected both in the smaller size of the new package and in pledges by government officials to limit the issuing of bonds to finance the package. ''The basic policy is to minimize bond issues,'' said Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the Economic Planning Agency.</p>
        <p>But Shizuka Kamei, the head of the governing party's policy-making arm and a critic of colleagues who advocate fiscal restraint, said the government was likely to issue construction bonds to pay for a portion of the additional expenditures.</p>
        <p>''To the market, a bond is a bond,'' said Ronald Bevacqua, senior economist at Commerz Securities. ''Whether it's a deficit-financing bond or a construction bond, it increases the government's financial obligations.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Sakaiya and other officials worry that further bond issuance will result in a rise in interest rates, making the government's debt payments more expensive. ''Their job is getting tougher and tougher,'' said Kunji Okue, senior economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson here. ''They're worried about an increase in their debt service obligations.''</p>
        <p>In addition to any new bonds, the government will be required to issue a staggering amount in bonds to refinance existing debt. This fiscal year, the government will issue 53 trillion yen in refinancing bonds -- now $495 billion -- and that will rise to 63 trillion for refinancing the following year. By the fiscal year 2006, almost 100 trillion yen in bonds will be needed just to refinance public debt, Mr. Okue said.</p>
        <p>The new budget seems to be a small victory for fiscal conservatives in the government, like Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and Koichi Kato, a leading figure in the ruling party who has lobbied hard for restraint. The last supplemental budget, passed in November 1999, cost 18 trillion yen, and Mr. Kamei, the Liberal Democrats' policy chief, was lobbying for a similarly large supplemental budget this time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kamei sought today to emphasize the total size of the package, notably the noncash components like credit guarantees.</p>
        <p>But economists doubted their effectiveness, and noted that there was still seven trillion yen in government credit guarantees -- about $65 billion -- available under less restrictive programs from the last two supplemental budgets.</p>
        <p>''Why would a small-business person borrow from a more restrictive loan program when he can still tap the special program that doesn't require any rigorous financial checks?'' Mr. Okue said.</p>
