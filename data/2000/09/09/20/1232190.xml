        <p>After a wave of complaints about abusive treatment of foreigners by immigration agents that gave Oregon's largest city the unwanted nickname of ''Deportland'' in some Asian countries, the top immigration official in Portland said today that he was retiring.</p>
        <p>The announcement by the district director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, David Beebe, followed calls for his resignation by the city's mayor, the state's governor and several members of Congress.</p>
        <p>The officials were incensed about some highly publicized incidents of mistreatment of foreigners arriving from Japan at the Portland airport, and over continuing reports that Portland immigration agents detained or deported foreign travelers at much higher rates than at other West Coast airports.</p>
        <p>A furor erupted last month over a report in The Oregonian, the state's biggest newspaper, that agents had strip-searched and jailed a Chinese businesswoman for two nights before concluding that her passport was legitimate and sending her on her way to New York.</p>
        <p>Portland's mayor, Vera Katz, described the incident as ''monstrous.''</p>
        <p>Most of the official wrath fell on Mr. Beebe, 55, a 25-year veteran of the immigration agency, whose defenders said that he operated his district ''by the book'' and that there were several reasons to explain why Portland's deportation rates might be higher than those in other big West Coast cities.</p>
        <p>Some defenders said he was being used as a scapegoat for doing his job too well.</p>
        <p>Delta Air Lines, citing low ridership and saying the immigration agency situation was a factor, said earlier this month that it was discontinuing all nonstop flights from Asia to Portland, beginning next April.</p>
