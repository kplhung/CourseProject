        <p>The Senate's overwhelming vote today to give permanent trade benefits to China ended a clash between America's global economic interests and the notion that the United States could use the annual threat of trade sanctions to change Beijing's behavior.</p>
        <p>In the end, it wasn't even close -- and behind that lies a new reality in how the United States deals with China, the world's most populous nation.</p>
        <p>Despite the huge margin by which President Clinton won today -- 83 to 15, his biggest legislative victory in the foreign policy arena since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 -- the reversal of policy toward China cemented into law today was hardly assured, given all the impediments over the years.</p>
        <p>During the last four years alone, it looked like the effort to normalize trade relations could be derailed by allegations of Chinese meddling in American elections, by accusations that Chinese spies had stolen American nuclear secrets, by considerable evidence that China still ships missiles to Pakistan, by Chinese threats against Taiwan.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the measure passed today despite the State Department's recent conclusion that China's human rights violations have, if anything, grown more egregious this year. And it passed precisely seven weeks before a presidential election, even though labor unions viewed the accord as a threat to their jobs and strongly hinted that they would punish Democrats who supported it.</p>
        <p>Yet every time a crisis erupted and receded, China's economic and political role in the world seemed to loom ever larger, from Motorola plants in Illinois to farms in Iowa. Over time it became clear that Congress' periodic threat that it would refuse to renew China's annual trade status was empty, and the Chinese came to dismiss it as saber-rattling.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, American business became more energized about stabilizing the economic relationship with China -- and therefore preserving their ballooning investments there -- than on any other issue in recent legislative history.</p>
        <p>So today senators of every stripe ended up voting for the trade bill. That included Fred Thompson, the Republican from Tennessee who conducted the campaign finance investigation and last week derided the ''little people'' in the business community who ''need to be taken down a notch'' because they orchestrated the defeat of an amendment to the trade bill that would have punished China for the spread of arms.</p>
        <p>Now, though, the hard part starts.</p>
        <p>Arguments still rage about whether the North American Free Trade Agreement helped or hurt the booming American economy. In the case of China, the facts are different: all the trade concessions were on China's part, the price of entering the World Trade Organization. Nonetheless, it can be expected that China will begin to drag its heels on carrying them out, for fear that letting in American steel will wipe out huge state-owned industries or letting in Japanese and American cars will threaten China's efforts to become the next industrial behemoth.</p>
        <p>But the real test will come as America tries to use its deepening trade relationship as leverage to open China's political system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton won the battle over trade with China by first convincing himself, and then helping convince Congress, that rejecting normal economic ties with the world's most populous country would hurt the American economy, and benefit Japanese and European competitors. Then he gradually elevated the argument from the economic to the strategic, making the case that rejection would also help political hard-liners in China who are certain that America's real agenda is to contain growing Chinese power.</p>
        <p>''The argument that made the difference in the Yellow Oval Room had to do with what happens if this didn't pass,'' said Samuel R. Berger, the president's national security adviser, referring to the room in the White House residence where Mr. Clinton twisted arms. ''We would undermine China's reforms, scare the daylights out of our allies, and send a message to the world that at the pinnacle of our power we are in retreat.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton today celebrated his victory with a line he used often during those nighttime sales pitches, telling reporters this afternoon, ''We will find, I believe, that America has more influence in China with an outstretched hand than with a clenched fist.''</p>
        <p>And in the next breath, as eager as always to repair the breach with unions and environmentalists and others who believe they were sold out by the White House, he insisted that opening China to more commerce with shrink the control of the government. ''It will strengthen those within China who fight for higher labor standards, a cleaner environment, for human rights and the rule of law,'' he said. Maybe he will be proven right, maybe not -- it will be years, maybe decades, before anyone can judge. As Mr. Clinton himself acknowledged today, ''none of us should think for a moment that any of these outcomes are guaranteed.''</p>
        <p>But what makes the experiment interesting is that only eight years ago both the Congress and Mr. Clinton were headed in precisely the opposite direction.</p>
        <p>In 1992, when memories of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre were still vivid, Congress made the annual renewal of China's trading rights conditional on a range of changes in Beijing. President Bush vetoed the measure. The Senate fell just short of the two-thirds vote needed to override him -- which would have essentially terminated China's trading privileges with the United States -- by a vote of 60 to 38.</p>
        <p>Within months, Mr. Clinton was charging Mr. Bush with ''coddling dictators.'' It was not until he arrived in the White House, and spent a year unsuccessfully trying to link trade with China's human rights record, that Mr. Clinton ended a fierce fight within the White House and reversed himself. He became a passionate adherent of Mr. Bush's policy -- and took it several steps further.</p>
        <p>''This was a case where Clinton's new position gathered momentum slowly,'' said Lee Hamilton, the former Indiana congressman who spent much of his career dealing with China issues. ''Tiananmen seems like a long time ago. Then the business interests started lobbying this very hard. And good economic times have been a factor: People are now persuaded that trade has a lot to do with our prosperity.''</p>
        <p>But not everyone is persuaded -- not by a long shot. Those who voted ''no'' included a hardy band of China's strongest critics on the left and right, liberals like Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat, and Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>
        <p>Then there were the disillusioned, but resigned, human rights advocates. Mike Jendrzejczyk, a top official of Human Rights Watch, noted that the timing of the vote ''is particularly unfortunate, just as human rights conditions are worsening.''</p>
        <p>''Beijing is closing down all channels of political dissent -- including the Internet,'' he added, ''even while it is opening its economy.''</p>
        <p>Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, who finished the 13-year negotiations with China over the rules under which it would enter the World Trade Organization, said in an interview this week that she learned two major lessons  from the roller-coaster effort to negotiate the huge accord.</p>
        <p>''The first is that you need an economic agreement whose advantages are beyond any doubt,'' she said. In fact, one of the differences between this debate and the arguments over the North American trade pact is that few, save for the most ardent union leaders, argued that the China trade deal would send American jobs overseas. (''No one ever made that case to me,'' Mr. Berger said. ''I was amazed.'')</p>
        <p>But the second argument, Ms. Barshefsky said, is that, ''You can only get trade agreements this big if you put them in a broader security framework, and link it to the security of the United States, or peace in Asia.'' That, of course, is the hallmark of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy: The linkage of trade to broader diplomatic goals. Essentially, he is betting that China cannot open its markets without also opening its political system. It cannot let in Amazon.com, he believes, without also letting any Dissidents.org broadcast their message around China. The Chinese leaders also believe that their entry into the W.T.O. will bring about change, ushering in foreign technology and foreign capital. But they think it is change they can manage and control.</p>
        <p>Today's vote has cemented in place the Clinton imprint on American foreign policy, the use of economic engagement to foster political change. But the judgment about whether he has created a second opening to China depends, in the end, on what China's leaders do with the economic and political opportunity.</p>
