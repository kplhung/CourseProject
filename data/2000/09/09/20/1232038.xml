        <p>Artsandlettersdaily.com and Scitechdaily.com -- For someone who wants to subscribe to every magazine on the planet, it's a great way to get a good distillation of daily articles. Scitechdaily.com is the same thing, but for science journals.</p>
        <p>Google.com -- If you have a dim memory for some line of text, you can type it in and it will take you right to the source.</p>
