        <p>WITH 170 million people and more than 10 million computers, five times the number in use five years ago, Brazil is the most promising Internet and e-commerce market in Latin America.</p>
        <p>Brazil accounted for 80 percent, or about $400 million, of e-commerce sales in Latin America in 1999, according to recent market studies. But e-commerce in Brazil is still in its infancy -- only 6 percent of the country's 500 largest companies have complete e-commerce sites, according to a survey conducted earlier this year.</p>
        <p>With online sales expected to double this year and again in 2001, dozens of access providers are competing to find the best strategy to lure consumers to the Internet.</p>
        <p>Bradesco, Brazil's largest private bank, started the battle late last year when it began offering free Internet access to attract customers and promote its site, www.bradesco.com.br, which sells products ranging from books to car parts. Other banks soon followed and quickly found themselves joined by start-up providers that consider free access the surest path to profitability.</p>
        <p>''Free access to the Internet is the model most appropriate for the reality of Brazil and, for that matter, most of the rest of Latin America,'' said Nizan Guanaes, the director of iG, an Internet provider. ''In a society like the United States, paid access may be the way to go, but here people can't afford it, and so we have to create a different system.''</p>
        <p>IG, which stands for Internet Gratis, or free Internet, opened six months ago and said it now had 2.5 million users and 11 million daily page views. Mr. Guanaes said that the number of users was growing by more than 10,000 a day, and he predicted that the Sao Paulo-based service would be profitable ''by the end of next year.''</p>
        <p>The site carries advertising and earns a commission on sales. It also plans to use its broadband and cell phone services to subsidize its Internet service.</p>
        <p>The market leader has been Universo Online, or UOL, a venture between two  media groups -- Folha, which publishes Folha de Sao Paulo, the largest newspaper in Sao Paulo, and Abril, the largest magazine group in Brazil, which also has a cable network.</p>
        <p>UOL, of Sao Paulo, said it had 780,000 subscribers, up 50 percent from last year, and charges $11 to $22 a month for access to www.uol.com.br, which provides stock quotes, news, sports and entertainment information and offers products for sale.</p>
        <p>''It is mathematically and logically impossible for the free access model to prevail in Brazil, for one simple reason,'' said Caio Tulio Costa, the director general of UOL. ''You can't possibly turn a profit that way, and the behavior of the market, not only here but elsewhere, is already showing that advertising alone does not provide enough revenue to make money.''</p>
        <p>Conspicuously missing from the list of major players is America Online, the online leader in the United States. AOL, working with Cisneros Group of Venezuela, entered the Brazilian market late. When it did arrive, it found that its domain name already belonged to a small provincial provider, and it was forced to adopt the cumbersome name of www.americaonline.com.br. Then a disastrous start in November led to the departure of its president.</p>
        <p>As is the case in other countries, none of the providers in Brazil are making money, and the market is cluttered with providers who are not expected to survive. UOL recently announced its second-quarter results, and despite a 28 percent growth in revenue, it posted a $45 million loss.</p>
        <p>Though the number has fallen from a peak of more than 600 in 1997, there are still about 150 providers, including several with free access, like Terra Networks and StarMedia, whose focus is the Spanish-speaking Latin American market, rather than Brazil, where most people speak Portuguese.</p>
        <p>Like other countries in Latin America, Brazil faces infrastructure problems that are slowing development.</p>
        <p>Though the number of fixed phone lines has nearly tripled since 1994, to 35 million from 13 million, and cell phone ownership has soared to 15 million from 800,000, half the population still does not have a phone line, according to the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion, a market research firm.</p>
        <p>In addition, even with the privatization of the telephone system over the last two years, per-minute rates are high. So the more the Internet is used, the higher the phone bill, with charges for cell phones, often promoted as an alternative to reach the Internet, being even more expensive.</p>
        <p>''If you stay online all day, you're going to end up with a considerable phone bill at the end of the month, and that is not the way to make access viable to the lower classes who see the computer as a promising tool,'' said Luis Carlos Boucinhas, the executive director of Globo.com, the site operated by Rede Globo, the country's largest television network. ''We're already a broadband provider, and we are betting that, along with wireless access, is where the future lies.''</p>
        <p>Some of the obstacles to e-commerce are not online. People who buy goods online must trust a hit-or-miss postal system. Private courier services like Federal Express, United Parcel Service and DHL are booming, but countries like Brazil, which is larger than the continental United States, and neighboring Colombia and Peru have areas that are too remote for conventional transportation systems.</p>
        <p>Yet the main barrier to e-commerce here, as in the rest of Latin America, is economics, not infrastructure. Only 10 percent of Brazil's population has an income of $300 a month or more, and it is that group that accounts for more than 80 percent of the country's five million Internet users.</p>
        <p>''Until costs associated with accessing the Internet come down significantly, so that people in lower income brackets can get online, the B-to-C market in Brazil will never be large enough to justify overly optimistic expectations,'' Maria Carolina da Costa of Intellifact International wrote recently in an essay for InfoBrazil.com.</p>
        <p>In hopes of reversing that trend, low-cost initiatives intended to expand use of the Internet are being created. Some post offices now offer 15 minutes daily of free access to customers willing to wait in line, and a pilot project in the city of Campinas allows users to call a telephone number and receive or send e-mail messages, for 25 cents a minute.</p>
        <p>Globo.com has signed an agreement with a government bank to extend $890 million in low-interest loans to help poor families buy computers.</p>
        <p>Many market analysts predict that it will not be long before the bulk of the population has access to the Internet through devices that can be bought and installed at home, whether an inexpensive computer, WebTV or Palm hand-held units.</p>
        <p>''The price of computers is dropping and cellular use is exploding,'' Mr. Guanaes said. ''I believe that by 2005 Brazil will be one of the three top Internet markets in the world.''</p>
        <p>But others are more cautious.</p>
        <p>''In 1995, every bank and investment research company in Brazil predicted that there would be more than 10 million pay-television subscribers by 2000,'' Mr. Costa said. ''But that figure has been stuck at 2.5 million for the past three years, which just goes to show that you have to view every prediction about this market with skepticism.''</p>
