        <p>THE scene could have been ripped right out of an ''Ally McBeal'' episode.

        <p>THE scene could have been ripped right out of an ''Ally McBeal'' episode. Kevin Fong, a venture capitalist at the Mayfield Fund in Menlo Park, Calif., was driving through downtown San Francisco recently when, after slamming on his brakes to avoid hitting a cyclist, the driver of a green minivan scraped the rear bumper of his BMW 328 convertible.</p>
        <p>The two climbed out of their cars, Mr. Fong said, and ''we started talking. I told him I was a venture capitalist.'' The driver perked up and, almost effortlessly, slipped into his pitch for an Internet broadband wireless concern he hoped to finance. '' 'I'm starting a company,' ''Mr. Fong said the man told him. '' 'Want to see my business plan?' ''</p>
        <p>Unlike Ms. McBeal, who at least got a date out of her fender-bender, the minivan driver has yet to follow up. Still, ''He said the magic words,'' Mr. Fong said. ''The idea had promise.''</p>
        <p>His conversation is a typical one in Silicon Valley these days. Entrepreneurs there have become the dot-com equivalent of waiters in Hollywood hoping any chance encounter with a producer or agent will make them both famous and rich.</p>
        <p>Not even April's technology meltdown has dampened the entrepreneurial enthusiasm. If anything, venture capitalists say, they are even more aggressive now that investors have become that much more selective about what they will put their money in.</p>
        <p>David Cowan, a managing general partner at Bessemer Venture Partners in Menlo Park, for one, recalled a recent encounter with a ''naked and sweating'' stranger who was pitching an idea for an Internet company in a steam room at a Four Seasons Hotel in California. And of course there is the steady stream of doctors and dentists who, once he is undressed or has a mouthful of tools, launch into ideas of their own. Mr. Cowan, of course, is open-minded. Who wouldn't be when it's your doctor? But such encounters can be disconcerting, too.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather not be facing a dentist's drill at the moment I am making a decision whether this is an idea I want to pursue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If anyone knows how intrusive entrepreneurs can be, it's James Breyer, a partner at Accel Partners in Palo Alto, Calif. The worst, he said, are the packs of entrepreneurs who trail behind him when he has left the podium after giving a speech, begging for five minutes of face time. At July's Global Internet Summit, sponsored by the Industry Standard at the Ritz-Carlton, Laguna Niguel, in California, for instance, he said four people followed him into the men's bathroom.</p>
        <p>So has Mr. Breyer become a frequent stall user to avoid unwanted attention? No, he said, laughing. ''They can talk over the door.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he looks for other parts of the hotel for privacy. ''People feel like they have to go the extra mile to capture your attention.''</p>
        <p>Over the last few months, Mr. Breyer has been receiving more flashy gifts with the hundreds of business plans that are sent to him each month. An avid fly-fisherman, he receives at least one fish-related gift each week, he said, everything from plastic trout replicas to posters of hand-tied fishing flies. So far the most unusual gift was the replica of a ''Gone With the Wind'' theme park an entrepreneur wanted to build outside of Atlanta. ''I said, 'This ranks as one of the 10 craziest plans of the year,' '' he said. '' 'We are not going to invest.' ''</p>
        <p>Sometimes these top-speed business plans are called ''elevator pitches,'' meaning they're made in the time a venture capitalist is held hostage between lobby and office. The term is rarely used by actual venture capitalists, but, perhaps not surprisingly, has taken on a life of its own, spawning services and Web sites. At TheElevator.com, for instance, entrepreneurs get 150 words to make an ''elevator pitch.'' The cost? The site charges investors a $150 registration fee for the privilege of checking out the ideas -- and would-be entrepreneurs $79.95 if a pitch requires revision.</p>
        <p>But why wait for an elevator ride when you can just show up? Entrepreneurs now brazenly stop by offices uninvited, particularly on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, the heart of Silicon Valley's venture community.</p>
        <p>JUST ask Barry Eggers, a venture capitalist at Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer Venture Partners. One afternoon two months ago, he said, a couple of 20-somethings informed his receptionist they had a scheduled meeting despite no record in Mr. Eggers's calendar. '' 'There must be some mistake,' '' Mr. Eggers said one of the young men told her.</p>
        <p>There was no mistake. The older of the two men was a Hollywood actor and spokesman for a health and lifestyle Web site and, after a few minutes, admitted he had no appointment. Mr. Eggers told him that with no appointment he was welcome to leave. But the young man was not daunted. Instead he held up a television fan magazine and pointed at one of the faces on the cover, pleading, ''But this is me!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eggers still showed him the exit.</p>
        <p>''Clearly they were going door-to-door,'' he said. But in Silicon Valley, one person's annoyance may be the next person's brilliant idea. ''Gimmicks do not help your cause,'' he said. ''But you know what? I bet someone sat down with them anyway.''</p>
