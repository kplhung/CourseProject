        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>BRASS FOR BUSH  Gov. George W. Bush, who has sharply criticized the Clinton administration's defense policies, has picked up the endorsement of several retired military leaders, including senior officers who served in influential positions under President Clinton. The list, to be announced today by Mr. Bush's running mate, Dick Cheney, in Lancaster, Calif., includes Adm. Jay L. Johnson, who stepped down as the Navy's top admiral in July, and Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the commander of American forces in the Persian Gulf, who also retired this summer. Others include two former commandants of the Marine Corps, Gen. Charles C. Krulak and Gen. Carl Mundy Jr.; and two former chiefs of the Air Force, Gen. Ronald R. Fogelman and Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, all of whom served under President Clinton. The officers are part of a new group called ''Veterans for Bush-Cheney.''</p>

        <p>THE RUNNING MATES</p>
        <p>RUNNING FOR ECONOMIST  Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said yesterday that Gov. George W. Bush showed a flawed understanding of the national economy when he said this week that he would not retreat from a tax cut in the middle of a recession but would cut even more, even at the risk of creating a ''short-term deficit.'' That approach might worsen a recession, Mr. Lieberman said at a campaign stop in Fresno, Calif. ''We can't afford that,'' he declared. ''Deficits lead to higher interest rates, and what does that mean? Higher mortgage payments. Higher car payments. Higher student loan payments.'' He predicted that Mr. Bush's plan for a $1.3 billion tax cuts over the next decade would lead to deficits and noted that even Republican leaders in Congress had not advocated so large a cut. Vice President Al Gore has proposed a $500 million package of tax cuts.</p>

        <p>SEE DICK RUN. SEE DICK FISH.  Dick Cheney is an avid, even fanatical, fly fisherman. His Secret Service code name is Angler. On the stump he often talks wistfully about forgoing the fall fishing season in order to campaign for the vice presidency. So he looked more than pleased on Monday when he took a break from policy speeches and led his entourage and motorcade to Kaufmann's Fly Fishing, just outside Portland, Ore. After looking over the fly boxes, $600 rods and all-weather gear, he picked up a rod and reel and headed out to the parking lot to show off a few graceful casts, nearly landing a television camera crew. Then he headed back to dry reality, a Chamber of Commerce speech.</p>

        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>TAKE MY MONEY, PLEASE  Sometimes candidates raise more campaign cash than they can use and start giving the excess to candidates who have come up short. So when Representative Peter R. Deutsch, a four-term Democrat from Florida's 20th Congressional District, at the tip end of the state, offered to give some excess cash to the Democratic National Committee to help elect Al Gore, there was no great surprise. He had almost $2.5 million in his kitty and essentially no place to spend it because his only challenger in November is a write-in candidate, Ed Kopanski of Key West. Besides, Mr. Gore is scrambling hard to snatch Florida away from Gov. George W. Bush, whose brother Jeb is the state's governor. Then the check came in, for a whopping $250,000. Democratic fund-raisers say the contribution may be the largest of its kind ever from a member of Congress to a national campaign. Mr. Deutsch, who campaigned for Mr. Gore during the primary season and held a fund-raiser for him in April that pulled in more than $400,000, says he sent in his big check because while the Gore-Lieberman ticket has made good progress in recent weeks, it still lags in fund-raising.</p>

        <p>THE GREEN PARTY</p>
        <p>NOT WORRIED ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY  Ralph Nader said yesterday that the Social Security retirement program is sound and all those cries of crisis by other presidential candidates are nothing but political propaganda that is needlessly scaring voters. ''The idea that Social Security is going to run out of money is simply nonsense,'' he told reporters in Washington yesterday. ''Panic fueled by opportunistic politicians and investment firms poses the only serious threat to the program.'' He derided suggestions that the country consider privatizing all or parts of the program or financing it with money from other government programs and sources. The plan as is will pay reasonable benefits at least for the next half-century if the economy stays healthy, he said, adding that any unlikely shortages that might crop up could be handled by taxing things like stock transactions, options and executive bonuses. He then proposed increasing benefits for widows and low-income workers.</p>

        <p>THE TRAVEL LOG  With Al Gore starting his day in Los Angeles and ending it in Silicon Valley, he lagged a bit in the frequent-flier sweepstakes with George W. Bush who traveled from Chicago to Lexington, Ky., to Pittsburgh. But today's another day.</p>
        <p>Here are the stats for Tuesday:  Length of the Official Day: Gore, 12 hours; Bush, 13 hours  States Visited: Gore, 1; Bush, 3  Towns and Cities Visited: Gore, 4; Bush, 3  Events: Gore, 2; Bush, 2.  Interviews: Gore, 1; Bush, 3  Diners Visited/Unscheduled Drop-bys: Gore, 1; Bush, 0  Main message: Gore, working families; Bush, middle class</p>
