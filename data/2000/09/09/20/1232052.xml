        <p>WHILE Hollywood's moguls are trying to figure out the big budget future of online entertainment, Alan Miller is staking his claim to a modest, but tangible, piece of that future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller has long had a love affair with film. For many years, the 43-year-old Mr. Miller was a salesman of various supplies and machinery, carving out a good living, raising a family of four children.</p>
        <p>But like lots of folks with stars in their eyes, Mr. Miller wanted badly to be part of the movie industry. He often took jobs that were flexible just so he would have time to be an extra in films. But as he got into his mid-30's, Mr. Miller figured he would have to try a different road if he was really going to make some mark in films.</p>
        <p>Then, eight years ago, Mr. Miller watched an old CBS movie called ''Saying Kaddish,'' starring Tovah Feldshuh. The proverbial light bulb went off in his head, and he called up one of the producers. The producer was happy to let Mr. Miller take a shot at reselling the movie and, soon enough, he had made a deal with a Canadian distributor. By the end of the year, Mr. Miller had found his entree; now his company, Academy Entertainment Inc., is one of the largest distributors of independent films.</p>
        <p>''All right, you can call them B movies,'' Mr. Miller said. ''But that doesn't mean they are bad. In fact, some of the documentaries are quite good. There are a lot of people out there who need programming and can't afford major motion pictures or TV shows.''</p>
        <p>And now some of those people who are seeking out Mr. Miller's list are on the Internet. Video on the Internet is a nascent business, not ready for prime time or for big studios. The pictures seen on the computer are often of substandard quality, and the modem capacity on most computers to store and show long films is a burden. In any case, there are few people who actually want to see video on a computer screen.</p>
        <p>Until high-speed abilities on the server end are tied to larger screens and a mass distribution system, the potential for film and video on the Internet is fairly dormant.</p>
        <p>But according to Mr. Miller, more and more Web sites want to try using video to attract people to their sites. Paramount and Warner Brothers and the other large producers and distributors are not about to let the new Joes on the block have ''Seinfeld'' or ''Saving Private Ryan'' -- not that those new Joes could pay the freight anyway.</p>
        <p>Yet Academy has, say, 20 hours' worth of old Vietnam War documentaries, many in 12-minute chunks, or a few old Betty Boop cartoons or a 1935 Bela Lugosi serial and even ''Tulsa,'' a drama that Robert Preston made a decade before he became the ''Music Man.'' ''You would be surprised what people will use,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>''There are horror films and documentary series and how-tos and sci-fi,'' he added. ''Things that are in series, where people can show them over a period of time, are great for me, since it's not the kind of thing that major studios want.''</p>
        <p>Most of Mr. Miller's clients are still in traditional TV -- mostly independent or small cable stations looking to fill up hours with cheap programming. About half of Mr. Miller's several thousand hours of films are owned by producers who do not want to do the selling. The others he has collected, and they fill his home office in Bergenfield, just outside New York.</p>
        <p>But more and more, Mr. Miller is finding the Internet a good outlet for the B's of the film business. ''It may be just like the old days in TV,'' he said. ''People are trying to establish themselves and streaming video is one way to do that.''</p>
        <p>A good seller for Mr. Miller is his Almanac Series, which has 377 four-minute news stories, one for each day of the year, which means there are always a few extras. But for video, they are short and to the point, which is important for new, and often not well-financed, Web sites.</p>
        <p>This year, Mr. Miller said, about one-third of Academy Entertainment's business will be Internet-related, most of the transactions coming in three- or low-four-figure sales.  But he is doing this, he said, to at least get a foothold for later on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller might have a short window to establish the Internet side of his business, said Stephen J. Andriole, a senior vice president and chief technology officer at Safeguard Scientifics, an Internet venture capital and investment firm in Wayne, Pa.</p>
        <p>''Within the next couple of years, when the broadband infrastructure is ubiquitous, then you will see a slew of applications,'' he said. ''Then things will explode.''</p>
        <p>Not enough people have cable modems or D.S.L. lines, so most companies would not have the mass market to make money, he said. So now is the time for someone like Mr. Miller to do what he can, find a niche.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller thinks that a big part of his advantage is having a greater ability to experiment than the big players have. ''Studios right now are fearful of the Internet,'' he said. ''They see it as an unknown competitor. They wouldn't know what to do if someone asked for Internet-only distribution rights for a film. I'm happy to sell someone nonexclusive rights, exclusive rights, whatever, just so everyone knows what the deal is.''</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Miller is taking his niche and running with it. But his dream to be on the creative end of the film business has not died. He has stopped trying to be an extra, though. ''I've just finished shooting a horror film, mostly in and around Sandy Hook,'' (on the Jersey shore) he said.</p>
        <p>''It would be great to get a major studio interested. But if not, I guess I'll have to rep it myself. Maybe you'll see it streaming on a Web site sometime soon.''</p>
