        <p>There is no such thing as a golden boy in sports. Too many bottles of peroxide have been dumped on too many athletes' heads.</p>
        <p>So Landon Donovan's shining aura is not unique, even though he was golden in igniting the United States to an unprecedented berth in the Summer Games quarterfinals with a 3-1 victory over Kuwait tonight. The American men's 1-0-2 record is the best opening-round record the team has compiled in the Olympics.</p>
        <p>It was only the fifth victory for an American men's soccer team in 25 games (5-12-8) in 12 Olympic appearances dating to 1924. Two of those victories have come against Kuwait.</p>
        <p>The United States will play in Adelaide on Saturday at 6:30 p.m. local time (3:30 a.m. Eastern time) against the team that finishes second in Group D -- Japan, Brazil, South Africa or Slovakia, all of them with different styles and physical makeups.</p>
        <p>Clive Charles, the United States coach, does not want Donovan's play -- or lack thereof -- to develop into one of those raging controversies all over the soccer-playing world when coaches seem to go out of their way to hide Roberto Baggio types, little players who can score goals.  Lothar Osiander, the coach of the 1992 United States Olympic team, went into coaching gyrations to avoid using Steve Snow, who had scored in five consecutive preliminary games.</p>
        <p>Charles knew there were fans back in the States who were squawking over the Internet after Donovan did not play against the Czech Republic or Cameroon.</p>
        <p>''Those Czechs are just big,'' Charles said tonight. ''And those Cameroon guys just run right at you. But this game had Landon Donovan written all over it.''</p>
        <p>Charles, the man who decides whether Donovan runs or sits, said that if the Americans were playing the Czech Republic in the next game, ''he'd be sitting.''</p>
        <p>Charles, who coaches both men and women at the University of Portland in Oregon and doubles as the national Under-23 coach, knows about the impetuosity of youth. He understands that Donovan was getting antsy, being called back from the soccer factory in Germany.</p>
        <p>The 18-year-old gave up college and Major League Soccer to take a $400,000, four-year contract and plays on the reserve squad for Bayer Leverkusen in the German Bundesliga.</p>
        <p>He sat in the first two United States games, a couple of ties.</p>
        <p>''I won't kid you, I was disappointed,'' Donovan admitted tonight. ''I get some people saying, 'You should be playing,' but they're not part of the team. I know we have a lot of good players, and I just want to be part of the program. I told myself, 'Quit being a baby.' ''</p>
        <p>Tonight's game began in a driving rain, and Charles's own college player, Conor Casey, a strapping forward, had trouble planting his thick legs and moving his thick trunk. He was flopping all over the wet grounds, as Charles displayed either genius or overdue common sense -- depending on which chat room you are reading -- and sent Donovan into the game in the 30th minute tonight.</p>
        <p>He promptly kick-started the United States squad from a stolid state into something approximating fluidity and grace and intuition, all extremely un-American.</p>
        <p>Chris Albright moved up and Donovan became an attacking midfielder, finding seams that hadn't existed until he came into the game. Albright missed a header, Ben Olsen was wide left, Frankie Hejduk misplayed a Donovan backheel. And in the 40th minute, Danny Califf headed in a corner kick from Jeff Agoos.</p>
        <p>The United States kept up the pressure in the second half, with Albright digging out a goal between a defender and the goalkeeper in the 63rd minute. The Kuwaitis, who play in a national amateur league, came back in the 83rd minute and scored on a goal by Bader Najem. But in the 88th minute, Donovan and Josh Wolff staged a crisp two-on-one fast break with Wolff giving the ball back to Donovan for an easy tap-in goal. Afterward, Charles raved about him.</p>
        <p>''The first time I saw him, he was a skinny little kid with talent,'' Charles recalled. ''We need to get him some experience without the press saying, 'Why isn't he playing?' My job is to find the best time to play him.</p>
        <p>''There are things that Landon Donovan does better than anybody on the squad,'' Charles added. ''And there are things Landon Donovan does not do better than anybody on the squad.''</p>
        <p>The third goal was Donovan's reward for surviving a bad case of bench madness. But there are no guarantees he won't resume his relationship with the bench on Saturday.</p>
