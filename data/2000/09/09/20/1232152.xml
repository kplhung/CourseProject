        <p>A former Internal Revenue Service lawyer and four other men were indicted yesterday on charges of tax evasion and other crimes stemming from what prosecutors described as a stock swindle in which the profits were funneled through offshore accounts.</p>
        <p>A 37-count indictment, unsealed in Las Vegas, charged Max C. Tanner, a securities lawyer who had worked for the I.R.S., with tax evasion, money laundering, mail fraud and failing to report $4 million of income in 1996 and 1997. Half of that was gains from selling shares of Maid Aide Inc., a tiny cleaning service in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>The indictment contends that in September 1996 Mr. Tanner began a scheme to defraud investors by manipulating the price of Maid Aide shares. The stock jumped to $9.37 a share in 1998 after a meritless news release was issued earlier that year that Maid Aide was near a deal to acquire a Florida trucking company, the indictment said. The trucking deal never went through, and the shares fell to 13 cents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tanner's lawyer, Brian Sun of O'Neill, Lysaght &amp; Sun in Santa Monica, Calif., said he had not seen the indictment but that his client would plead not guilty.</p>
        <p>The indictment charges that Mr. Tanner created a company in Vancouver, British Columbia, and sent money and documents through FedEx to Canada and then to the Cayman Islands to circumvent tax and mail fraud laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tanner paid a kickback of 5 percent of his profits to Kevin J. Ruggiero, a securities broker from Lyndhurst, N.J., who ran the Empire State Building office of Baxter, Banks &amp; Smith, a Florida securities dealer, the indictment said. Mr. Ruggiero used unlicensed agents to sell Maid Aide shares through the Baxter, Banks brokerage firm, according to the indictment. No one answered the telephone last night at the St. Petersburg, Fla., office of the brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>Also indicted on conspiracy charges were three stock promoters: Dennis D. Evans of Las Vegas;  Kenneth W. Kurtz of Sandy, Uta; and Mark A. Taylor of Brooksville, Fla. Mr. Evans declined to comment last night. The other two men could not be reached.</p>
        <p>After paying the unlicensed sales agents commissions of up to 70 percent of the price of each share of Maid Aide sold, the indictment said, the five men pocketed about $3 million in profits.</p>
