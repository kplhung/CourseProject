        <p>Thanks to the Downtown Arts Festival and the Kitchen, several different performances were offered at various times on Thursday night at the Kitchen and at the nearby General Theological Seminary.</p>
        <p>Serge Laurent, curator of live arts at the Pompidou Center in Paris, arranged a series of events called Les Spectacles Vivants Sample, which presented solo dances by Xavier Le Roy and Claudia Triozzi and a concert of music by David Shea. The evening also included ''Shattered Boxes'' by Compagnie Faim de Siecle, a dance troupe based in both Paris and New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Le Roy's ''Self-Unfinished,'' at the Kitchen, was a theatrical journey into the bizarre. Mr. Le Roy was first seen as a man in street clothes performing simple actions. That he snorted and sputtered while he sat, stood and walked hinted that surprises would follow.</p>
        <p>After getting choreographically entangled in his clothes as he removed them, he twisted himself into such strangely contorted shapes that he resembled a Kafka hero transformed into a bug. But Mr. Le Roy's character eventually regained human form and the ingenious solo suggested that people are capable of unexpected metamorphoses.</p>
        <p>Ms. Triozzi's ''Park,'' presented in the seminary gymnasium, had its own oddities. For instance she sat beneath a hair dryer made of frankfurters, extracted dolls from a gelatin mold and spooned food into containers that kept toppling off a conveyor belt. Unfortunately, ''Park'' involved little more than a display of peculiar props.</p>
        <p>The evening's awkwardly arranged schedule meant that those who stayed to see Ms. Triozzi's entire solo could not see all of ''Shattered Boxes,'' which began back at the Kitchen before ''Park'' ended. Press releases stated that the work, conceived by Ibrahim Quraishi and Joel Cramesnil and choreographed by Arthur Aviles, was inspired by the Medea story. Seminude dancers gyrated atop platforms and inside lighted boxes while slides and video images of city scenes, geometrical designs and close-ups of hands and faces flickered across the walls. Seeing only parts of this multimedia spectacle made it impossible to assess its impact and coherence. But the dancing looked feverish and the technical effects were ingenious.</p>
