        <p>The six sprite-sized Americans were sitting as tight as piano keys on the edge of the arena floor tonight, telepathically willing a misstep by the Chinese or Russian teams that were still competing.</p>
        <p>The United States gymnasts had done all they could. After finishing off their routines with a spirited effort in the women's Olympic team final, the competition for the defending gold medalists was over. All they had left was the hope for an opening that would usher them onto the podium for a bronze medal -- the perfect cure for the team's dysfunctional state.</p>
        <p>But as soon as the Chinese revealed a steel-belted focus on the vault, the moment the Russian Yelena Zamolodtchikova blew the tip of her finger like a six-shooter to punctuate her spectacular floor routine, the American optimism was slowly nudged aside by the reality of an undesirable fourth-place finish.The USA Gymnastics plan had officially failed.</p>
        <p>To prevent the plunge of the United States women's program, to stop the embarrassing decay of a team just four years removed from gold in Atlanta, Bela Karolyi was pulled out of retirement last year by the USA Gymnastics president, Bob Colarossi, to whip up a medal. But tonight, while the dominant Romanians, easy winners with 154.608 points, were being draped with gold in the Super Dome, while the Russians (154.403) touched their silver medallions and the Chinese (154.008) cherished their bronze reward, the United States team members were venting their frustrations backstage.</p>
        <p>They were just 1.075 points behind the Chinese at 152.933, but that was the difference between harmony and discord among the Americans. That was the difference between celebrating Karolyi's impact as national team coordinator and railing against it.</p>
        <p>''Bela should not have had so much control,'' said Jamie Dantzscher, who scored a 9.712 on the floor exercise.</p>
        <p>''The personal coaches were given no credit. He gets so much credit when we do things right, but everyone else gets blamed when things go wrong.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday night, after the United States placed a disappointing sixth in the qualifying meet, Karolyi questioned the team's desire. Bound to his seat in the stands because of USA Gymnastics rules preventing noncoaches of the athletes on the floor, Karolyi was unable to stalk the floor as he has in the past. The blustery immigrant from Romania couldn't bearhug the gymnasts or pound positive vibes into their psyches; he couldn't shake their miniature shoulders or inspire them face-to-face. If he was on the floor Sunday night, he said he wouldn't have tolerated the flat demeanor of the team.</p>
        <p>''Tonight, they had much better attitude, more strength,'' said Karolyi, who watched the team pick up their performances in every event and show more unity as they rooted each other on. ''You could see it, it was like, 'Yes, now, we're ready.' ''</p>
        <p>So who receives the credit for the mood improvement? Was it Karolyi's prefinals speech to the team? Was it the reserved approach of Coach Kelli Hill? Tonight, she wore the same conservative cloak as always, but afterward Hill vehemently took issue with Karolyi's criticism.</p>
        <p>''It's not in my personality to be like Bela,'' Hill said. ''It's not that I'm upset, but after I heard the things he said following the first night, I asked him if he wanted to be out there; and he said, 'No.' So there you go.''</p>
        <p>This wasn't the way the plan was supposed to unfold. And the flaw in the blueprint was apparent: Colarossi should have either given total control to Karolyi or left him enjoying his retirement. Instead of bringing the team together, Karolyi's overbearing presence only splintered it.</p>
        <p>''To be a great motivator, you have to connect with the athletes,'' said Steve Rybacki, the assistant United States coach.</p>
        <p>''There were a number of girls on this team that he didn't make a connection with.''</p>
        <p>One of Rybacki's gymnasts, Dantzscher, was Exhibit 1. She resented the treatment she received from Karolyi after she rolled her ankle last week. Tonight, Dantzscher said she had been ignored by Karolyi, who openly criticized her for being inconsistent in qualifying.</p>
        <p>''It's so not fair,'' Dantzscher said. ''I wasn't treated as a person.''</p>
        <p>Some of the gymnasts supported Karolyi, at least to an extent. Two of the remaining members of the Magnificent Seven -- Amy Chow and Dominique Dawes -- were in Atlanta to feel the power of Karolyi's persuasiveness up close on the floor. Chow and Dawes praised Karolyi for being a motivator, but Dawes wondered if his faith in her had waned over the years.</p>
        <p>If so, she wanted to prove him wrong in her final competition. Dawes helped give the United States a chance to medal tonight by scoring a 9.7 in the team's best event of the night: the uneven bars. After the team scraped by on the treacherous balance beam -- with no dazzling scores, but no disastrous falls, either -- the Americans ended their night on the floor exercise.</p>
        <p>''We had hope,'' said Kristin Maloney, who scored a 9.737 on the floor, and was part of a great last effort by the United States. ''We knew we were still alive. Then, we had to watch and wait.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Romanians left very little to chance tonight. The team is deep -- from the 1996 Olympian Simona Amanar to the all-around world champion Maria Olaru to tiny Andreea Raducan -- and they don't make mistakes. Or at least not many. They built a solid lead and then, like the Americans, had to wait out the last two rotations until the Chinese and the Russians finished.</p>
        <p>Once, a collapse by the Russians might have seemed unthinkable. But in the penultimate rotation tonight, the diva of the uneven bars, Svetlana Khorkina, stunned everyone when she crashed to the mat. The Chinese seemed unflappable, but the team had been vulnerable on the vault apparatus before, the same event that loomed at the end of their competition.</p>
        <p>''Maybe there would be a mistake,'' Karolyi said. ''But it didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>It happened for the Romanians, who had never beaten the Russians in an Olympic competition, finishing second to them in four of the last six Games. Their only gold medal came in 1984, when most of the Eastern bloc boycotted the Games.</p>
        <p>''It's very nice to win,'' said the Romanian assistant coach, Maria Bitang. ''The Russians had a lot of pressure, and they made many mistakes.''</p>
        <p>But not enough to prevent the American gymnasts from leaving the Olympic stage without a medal for the first time since 1988. The plan to maintain the team's dominance in the world, to keep it on the Olympic stage fell just short. Only 1.075 points separated success from failure, dysfunction from delight.</p>
