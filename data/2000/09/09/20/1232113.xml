        <p>Like the French satirical television show that twits the United States for being the ''World Company'' that invades people's lives around the globe, the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, expresses frustration, and perhaps a little envy, at America's dominion.</p>
        <p>He is more elegant, although for a top diplomat refreshingly undiplomatic, in how he expresses what he sees as the problem of a world run exclusively by the United States.</p>
        <p>''This situation is unprecedented: what previous empire subjugated the entire world, including its adversaries?'' Mr. Vedrine writes in his new book, in which he loves to use his shorthand for the United States, ''hyperpower,'' which makes the Clinton administration cringe.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Vedrine says that a new equilibrium will eventually evolve, and France, as the current president of the European Union, is busy trying to construct it with a more streamlined Europe -- with France at its center -- rising as a future equal, rather than a junior, partner.</p>
        <p>The United States should not worry about this, he said in an interview. Europe, he said, is not about to take on the ''hyperpower,'' which he finds the most telling way to describe America's military, linguistic, cultural and business dominance.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe it would necessarily lead to rivalry,'' he said between meetings with fellow foreign ministers at the United Nations General Assembly earlier this month. ''It could be a real alliance between the United States of tomorrow and the Europe of tomorrow. I don't mean an alliance as we know today but a real partnership. But it would, I grant, disturb the habits and usual trends of American leadership.''</p>
        <p>Since becoming foreign minister three years ago, Mr. Vedrine, 53, a lawyer and previously the senior foreign policy adviser to Francois Mitterrand when he was president, has made a priority of making distinctions between France and the United States. That has left senior Amrican officials muttering more than usual about the French.</p>
        <p>Recently, Mr. Vedrine stunned Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, with whom he converses in French, by making France the only  country of 107 attending nations to refuse to sign a declaration on democracy that she had organized in Warsaw. (''Democracy is not like instant coffee where you can just add water and stir,'' he says).</p>
        <p>In his book, ''France's Assets in the Era of Globalization,'' (to be published in English later this year by the Center on the United States and France at the Brookings Institution), Mr. Vedrine argues that France has much to offer the world and must find the self-confidence to work toward a ''multipolar world'' that would undo the ''uniformity and the unilateralism'' that results from American supremacy.</p>
        <p>He scolds his fellow Frenchmen, who, he says, have much to be proud of in their modern age, for being too attached to their past: ''We have to avoid giving the impression that all we're doing is trying to keep a fading star from burning out completely.''</p>
        <p>To move Europe toward being the political and military powerhouse that France would like, the European Union has initiated a European defense plan.</p>
        <p>''Many American officials are of two minds about this,'' said Mr. Vedrine. ''There's the usual complaint that Europe is not taking a big enough share of the burden. And then there is the other traditional reaction that whenever Europe does something, people say, 'Be careful, you're going to resuscitate American isolationism.' ''</p>
        <p>Despite reservations at the Pentagon about the new European plan, particularly because it could duplicate the work of NATO, President Clinton was in favor of it, he said.</p>
        <p>Anyway, he said, the plan to strengthen Europe's defense should not be interpreted as a threat. ''We're not talking about having a go at the hyperpower,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In his book, Mr. Vedrine said that while many Europeans were sympathetic to France's complaints, they also believed that if France were as powerful as the United States today, the French would be even more unbearable.</p>
        <p>''France most of the time has a mythical approach to its history,'' he explained. ''I'm trying to tell them that there is no point in being nostalgic about when you were a great power. In France we're always talking about the voice of France, the universal mission of France. I'm trying to say that you're only well received if we come up with bright ideas that no one else has.''</p>
