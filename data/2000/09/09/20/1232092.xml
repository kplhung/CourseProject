        <p>I'm the official interpreter, translator and all-around spokesman to the English-speaking world for the medieval Czech town of Cesky Krumlov.</p>
        <p>It might seem like an odd job for an American who came to Prague as a college student in the summer of 1990 and supported himself by playing the guitar on the Charles Bridge. The country had just ousted the Communists, and I played music that had been forbidden until then -- the Beatles; Simon and Garfunkel; and Bob Dylan.</p>

        <p>I'm the official interpreter, translator and all-around spokesman to the English-speaking world for the medieval Czech town of Cesky Krumlov.</p>
        <p>It might seem like an odd job for an American who came to Prague as a college student in the summer of 1990 and supported himself by playing the guitar on the Charles Bridge. The country had just ousted the Communists, and I played music that had been forbidden until then -- the Beatles; Simon and Garfunkel; and Bob Dylan.</p>
        <p>I came back two years later and met my future wife, Lenka, a Czech native, on the same bridge where I used to sing.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Prague had been discovered by tourists and had become too crowded for us, so we moved to Cesky Krumlov. At first, I taught English, but I wanted to be more independent. So I started making myself known among the locals as an American who speaks Czech and has a business license, a computer and permanent residence in this country. Everyone more or less jumped on me to represent the town and  welcome visitors. Within the space of a year, I became the official interpreter for the town and its famous 12th-century castle and chateau, once home of Bohemian kings.</p>
        <p>A few years back, when Jennone Walker was the American ambassador to the Czech Republic, she often came to town unannounced, just to poke around. Once, she called Pavel Slavko, the castle director, and asked if she could come down that Saturday morning to tour it with a friend. Dr. Slavko asked me to show up at 10 a.m. and act as interpreter. But at 9:15 on the appointed day, I received a frantic call from him: get over here now! It turned out that the friend was Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
        <p>Ten minutes later, I'm racing up the castle drive when I see four large black cars passing me in the opposite direction. Oh god, I think, she's here already. I sprint to the director's office, where I find her chatting with Dr. Slavko -- in fluent Czech.</p>
        <p>Somebody fetches a large plastic cola bottle from the fridge. It is filled with cold water, or so we think. But when we take our first sips, we realize it is actually Slivovice, a kind of fiery plum brandy. One by one, the glasses are set back down on the table, still full. Another container and more glasses arrive. This time it really is water.</p>
        <p>For most of the visitors to the castle, it's a completely new environment, and they are very careful about where they step and what they touch. Occasionally, we take nobility on tour, and they take liberties, like moving ropes, stepping onto blocked-off areas, pawing furniture. ''Oh, is this real? We have something like this in our castle.''</p>
        <p>Once Prince Charles came to visit the castle, and we took him through the interiors of the 19th-century Schwarzenberg suites. He was listening to the interpretation, not really reacting or looking too impressed except at a small chapel, a 6-by-6-foot chamber. He stepped forward to take a closer look but didn't notice the glass panel separating the room.</p>
        <p>After bashing his nose on the glass, he promptly proceeded to bleed. It may have been blue blood, but it was definitely red by the time it hit the floor. We all whipped out our handkerchiefs, then remembered protocol (I can't offer this thing to him, he's a prince!) and quickly stuffed them back in our pockets. After finding a clean handkerchief, the bleeding finally stopped and the visit of the rooms continued. But on this very glass, folks . . .</p>
