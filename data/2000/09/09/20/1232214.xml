        <p>Pseudo Programs, a pioneer in producing original entertainment for the Internet, this week became the latest in a string of companies to fail at that endeavor. Pseudo's 175 employees were laid off on Monday afternoon. Founded in 1994 by Josh Harris, above, the co-founder of the research firm Jupiter Communications, the SoHo-based Pseudo started as an online radio station and soon began streaming video programming that ranged from live chat about hip-hop music to short documentaries about New York City. Investors included Intel, Tribune Ventures and the French luxury goods retailer LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. But after several management shake-ups, Pseudo's shows still failed to attract enough viewers to build significant advertising revenues.</p>
