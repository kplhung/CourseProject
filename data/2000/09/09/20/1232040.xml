        <p>A YEAR ago, W. W. Grainger Inc., which distributes manufacturing valves, maintenance products and replacement parts for industry, had established itself as a pioneer in electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>Grainger, based in Lincolnshire, Ill., set out in 1995 to build more than just a line of defense against its competitors in the equipment and services industry known as M.R.O., or maintenance, repair and operations.</p>
        <p>The company, which had revenue of $4.45 billion in 1999, wanted to use Web technology to become an even stronger force in the industry.</p>
        <p>That is still the goal, but there have been growing pains. The homegrown technology used for Grainger.com, its first e-commerce site, was unable to support the features customers wanted, like a pop-up list as soon as they signed on showing supplies they usually buy or a procedure that required orders above a specific amount to be authorized. So Grainger was forced to slow down and move to a more flexible platform developed by BroadVision Inc.</p>
        <p>Customers also showed little enthusiasm for Orderzone.com, an electronic marketplace that Grainger had set up where customers could order not just the 220,000 products it carried but products from distributors in other businesses like laboratory supplies and factory safety equipment.</p>
        <p>In June, Grainger switched course, giving Orderzone.com and $21 million to Works.com of Austin, Tex., an Internet purchasing service for small and midsize businesses seeking office equipment and supplies, in exchange for a 40 percent stake in Works.com.</p>
        <p>''Orderzone taught us it is very difficult and expensive to build a stand-alone brand on the Internet,'' said Richard L. Keyser, Grainger's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>For all that, Grainger's revenue from its e-commerce ventures is expected to reach $400 million this year, compared with $101.5 million last year.</p>
        <p>Although only a small percentage of Grainger's 1.4 million customers are participating, the company is generating more Internet business than all of its competitors combined, said Jon Econiak, who follows e-business for Piper Jaffray, an investment company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Econiak said Grainger was playing catch-up on the technology front to newcomers like IndustrialAmerica, a procurement site scheduled to begin this fall.</p>
        <p>Grainger, for its part, thinks it will be more difficult for newcomers to duplicate the quick service and reliability of its 370 branch offices than for Grainger to match any online innovations. Grainger is investing $120 million this year in e-commerce initiatives, up from $100 million last year.</p>
        <p>''Our highest priority is to create a seamless linkage between bricks and clicks,'' Mr. Keyser said.</p>
        <p>''You can't fax motors,'' he added. ''You have to be able to get them there in short order.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Econiak said it could be a couple of years before Grainger or any other company provides what customers truly want: a Web-based process that integrates all of the functions involved in buying industrial supplies, including a procedure for returns.</p>
        <p>Most of Grainger's e-traffic -- about 6 percent of its total sales -- came from longtime customers who switched from calling or faxing orders to using its Web site. Grainger's research suggested that customers using the Internet increased their business with the company by 17 percent from 1998 to 1999. For customers who stayed with traditional channels, the growth rate was 8 percent.</p>
        <p>Grainger's growth is also receiving a lift from FindMRO.com,  a Web site the company started in November that helps customers find items it does not handle. By August, revenue was almost $6 million a month.</p>
        <p>After setting up FindMRO, Grainger moved on in April to an even more ambitious project called TotalMRO.com.</p>
        <p>TotalMRO tries to provide large companies that buy supplies from different distributors a single place where they can find prices, determine product availability and make transactions. This is somewhat akin to stuffing most of the M.R.O. universe into a single catalog.</p>
        <p>Grainger said it needed about 100 nationwide distributors to provide customers with access to some 15 million products. By early August, about 15 distributors dealing in 3.5 million products had signed on, and Earthgrains, the nation's second-largest baker, had become the first client.</p>
