        <p>WITH more merchants elbowing their way into the Internet bazaar, an old gimmick, the rebate, is increasingly being used to snare online customers.</p>
        <p>But beware: Rebates are not always a bargain.</p>
        <p>For one thing, a rebate is only a notice that buyers could save money; in fact, the device exists only because most people never get around to claiming the rebate.</p>
        <p>E-commerce researchers estimate that less than 10 percent of those who buy goods with rebates actually collect the money.</p>
        <p>Even for the diligent, there are times when a rebate merely brings the price of a camera, a video game or perhaps a computer down to the level of other good deals. And there are other cases in which prices are better without rebates.</p>
        <p>Another caution: While rebates are often offered to get customers to try a product in hopes of follow-up sales or merely to provide a spurt in sales, they are sometimes used to move items that have, for a reason not disclosed, lost their appeal.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes,'' said Adam Sarner, an analyst at the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn., which specializes in Internet-related market research, ''the product has been discontinued. And the $50 rebate may not be a guarantee that you've gotten a great deal. A better model may be coming out next week at around the same price as the old one without the rebate. And you'd much rather have it.''</p>
        <p>But there are some great deals in which the rebate -- which these days may apply to anything from refrigerators to lipstick -- reduces the cost of an item to nothing. That makes it free if time and effort are not counted.</p>
        <p>For example, Cyberrebate.com recently offered an $89 birdhouse, a $39 leather-bound notebook and an $89 children's book and microphone set called ''Barney Sing Along Songs,'' all with rebates that wiped out their costs. Freestuffpage.com offered a set of odor-eater shoe insoles with a rebate that made them free.</p>
        <p>How can they do it?</p>
        <p>The sellers actually get several things out of the transaction. One is market research. As in all rebate deals, the sellers require the buyer to provide information that will help them sell something else. This same information helps a company determine whether they are reaching their target audience. The seller may also persuade customers to try a product that they might otherwise have passed up; maybe the customer will like it and buy something else in the line. Finally, the seller has an opportunity to earn interest on the money until the rebate is paid several weeks later, although some analysts say many manufacturers are not organized enough to put the check into an interest-earning account while the rebate is processed.</p>
        <p>Of course, offering something for nothing is a great deal for the company if the customer does not bother to collect the rebate.</p>
        <p>Except when the net cost is nothing, comparing prices is still one of the best ways to shop. But comparison shopping can take time, and some people are just not interested.</p>
        <p>''The main idea of the Web is time and convenience,'' Mr. Sarner said, ''and you're going to get a lot of people who just want to cut to the chase and buy something.''</p>
        <p>In theory, one way to see several prices in the same place is to go to sites like eBates .com, Cyberrebates.com or RebatePlace .com, which present dozens of rebate offers in one place for everything from toys and books to packaged vacations and home appliances. But these sites are just getting started, and while they try to be comprehensive, they often fall short.</p>
        <p>They are getting better, and Gene Alvarez, the program director for electronic business strategies at META Group, another Internet research company in Stamford, Conn., said shoppers were beginning to go to the sites as they would go to a flea market.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what I'm looking for, but if I find something at the right price, I may be willing to buy it,'' Mr. Alvarez said.</p>
        <p>While bargain hunting, shoppers may see some extremely low prices, but the chances are the products have been refurbished. Sometimes they are clearly identified as such, sometimes not. Retailing specialists say refurbished products usually work fine and offer tremendous savings, but shoppers should know what they are buying.</p>
        <p>Even when the rebate seems to be the best deal, getting the money back can be tedious.</p>
        <p>To get most rebates, the bar code from the product's package must be mailed in with a proof of purchase within a certain time. Many people simply do not follow through, which works to the advantage of sellers. They sell the product and then keep all the money because they do not pay the rebate.</p>
        <p>Some analysts see a potential backlash: People who remember that they did not mail in their rebate claim may not be as impressed with a second offer. ''It kind of sets a mood,'' Mr. Sarner said.</p>
        <p>Rebates are just one of several things that can frustrate Internet shoppers.</p>
        <p>''What would really be great,'' Mr. Sarner said, ''would be a really great low price to begin with. And how about getting you your product on time so that you don't end up getting a tracking number. Or getting an e-mail three days later saying, 'Actually, we're out of stock.' ''</p>
        <p>On the Web, the rebate sites let users apply for rebates online, but the process does not always work. Paul Bates, the vice president for research at BizRate.com, which gives comparative prices and offers both discounts and rebates, estimates that the collection rate is still less than 10 percent.</p>
        <p>First, a new user must register to receive a rebate. But it is not always apparent that registration is necessary. Moreover, it is possible to just click on the product and buy it, in which case there would be no rebate. On subsequent visits, it is necessary to sign on. Failure to do so also means no rebate.</p>
        <p>When everything goes right, the rebate site holds onto the money and sends out checks each quarter.</p>
        <p>Internet experts say the range of prices on the Web that can often make a rebate seem worthless are a reflection of the chaos in the world's newest shopping place.</p>
        <p>Some rebates are being offered directly by manufacturers. Sometimes the same rebate is available from some, but not all retailers. And sometimes other retailers decide to offer discounts that are greater than the rebates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alvarez said he had been seeing more rebate offers and other discounts and expected to see even more.</p>
        <p>''It's becoming harder,'' he said, ''to capture the consumer.''</p>
