        <p>WHO -- or what -- is AXA?</p>
        <p>It's an invented word, meant to be pronounceable in the languages of every country where AXA, a huge French financial services conglomerate, does business. And in the United States, where the company's American division, AXA Financial Inc., owns Equitable Life, Alliance Capital Management and Sanford C. Bernstein, it is also the name that has been given to the financial planning arm of the company, known as AXA Advisors. AXA Advisors was created from the retail sales force of Equitable.</p>

        <p>WHO -- or what -- is AXA?</p>
        <p>It's an invented word, meant to be pronounceable in the languages of every country where AXA, a huge French financial services conglomerate, does business. And in the United States, where the company's American division, AXA Financial Inc., owns Equitable Life, Alliance Capital Management and Sanford C. Bernstein, it is also the name that has been given to the financial planning arm of the company, known as AXA Advisors. AXA Advisors was created from the retail sales force of Equitable.</p>
        <p>The AXA name is not new in the United States. It has been kicking around for about a year. It was introduced in a series of ads that ''told people who we were,'' said Terrance Little, vice president for advertising and communications for AXA Financial. But while brand recognition is far greater than it was, he said, having last been measured at 20 percent among participants in a tracking study, most people still do not know anything about AXA Advisors.</p>
        <p>To remedy that, a new campaign with billings of more than $30 million has just begun on television and in print, where AXA is ''not just telling people who we are, but what we can do for them,'' Mr. Little said. Television ads are running on what he called AXA's ''franchise properties,'' including the CBS College Football Halftime Report, ''Face the Nation,'' ESPN and CNBC. Print ads will be seen in Fortune, Forbes, Business Week, Golf Digest and Black Enterprise.</p>
        <p>The ads, created by Seiter &amp; Miller Advertising in New York for both broadcast and print, feature eight real financial planners, culled from among the 7,500 who work for AXA. Each addresses a specific need a financial planner can help customers meet: amassing retirement savings, for example, or handing over a family business to a new generation without losing it to taxes. ''We went all over the county to find these people,'' said Dan Cole, a senior partner.</p>
        <p>Putting the focus on them is ''unique in the industry,'' said Livingston Miller, a principal of the agency and its creative director. Other financial planners offer either ''a financial supermarket'' in their ads or place an emphasis on technology and ''how easy it is to do things online,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''But our model is different,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It is a live human being who takes the time to sit down and talk about what really underlies financial decisions.''</p>
        <p>One such person is Ann Calvert, who addresses the concerns of women older than 50, like her. In the television spot where she is featured, she is driving a 1957 Thunderbird convertible, tooling around a suburban neighborhood. ''Maybe it's death or divorce,'' she says, scarf flapping in the breeze, ''but all of a sudden women have all kinds of new responsibilities.'' These women, ''suddenly single,'' need help taking charge of their finances -- help she can provide, she says. The middle-aged and older women she drives past seem to agree. They take time from playing catch, changing storm windows, gardening and washing the car to acknowledge Ms. Calvert and return her waves.</p>
        <p>Another AXA adviser is Anthony Padilla, a burly young man seen lifting weights in a gym who addresses himself to the need for young people like him to begin accumulating savings, notwithstanding other, seemingly more pressing needs. And there is Mike Jarvis, who addresses himself to those potential clients in their 40's who think they are too far behind to ever have enough for retirement.</p>
        <p>''I can show you how to catch up,'' he says, as the spot shows an overweight child slowly working his way to the front of the pack in a foot race.</p>
        <p>In all of the television spots, as in the print ads, the spokesmen and spokeswomen for AXA are seen with building blocks -- bricks, really -- labeled with the AXA logo on their ends and words like ''Education,'' ''Savings,'' ''Protection'' and ''Planning'' on their sides. And in all the ads there is the tag line ''AXA Advisors -- Building Futures.''</p>
        <p>Will all of this play? There is, of course, the issue of the name, still largely unfamiliar. And then there is the fact that, as insurance sellers, most of the AXA Advisors financial planners used to be paid on commission. By going to a financial planning model, AXA has changed their compensation to a percentage of assets under management, the industry standard. There is risk in that, especially because AXA Advisors also plans to charge new clients $600 to prepare an initial financial plan for them, even though many rivals offer such a service as a free inducement to new customers.</p>
        <p>Still, the strategy is a good one, according to Jonathan Joseph, an analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton, an investment bank specializing in banking and insurance. He thinks abandoning the Equitable name was appropriate; while the change may confuse some potential clients, it minimizes the less-than-complimentary associations many people still make when they think of insurance salesmen. And as far as those salesmen (and saleswomen) are concerned, their new field is a better -- and broader -- one than the one where they labored before.</p>
        <p>''Financial planning is really growing today,'' Mr. Joseph said.  ''It's the place where people in this business have got to be.''</p>
