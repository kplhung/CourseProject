        <p>A 62-year-old gunsmith was found dead in his house on Long Island after an explosion and fire there last night, the Suffolk County police said.</p>
        <p>The victim, Ronald Tortorella, had ammunition in his Amityville house, but it was not clear whether it contributed to the explosion, said Officer Randy Jaret, a police spokesman. ''We haven't determined the cause at this point,'' he said. ''It's something we'll be looking into tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tortorella, who lived in the one-story ranch-style home at 31 Grand Central Avenue with his wife, a daughter and a granddaughter, was home alone at the time of the explosion, around 7:40 p.m., Officer Jaret said. Firefighters extinguished the fire, which destroyed most of the house, and found Mr. Tortorella's body in the kitchen, Officer Jaret said.</p>
        <p>The cause of death had not been determined last night.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Kaczmarski, who lives a few doors away from the Tortorellas' house and went out to watch the fire, said that as the house burned he could hear popping noises. ''Then a cop came down the street and said there were explosives in there and told us all to move back,'' he said.</p>
