        <p>Wishing to promote his image nationally, Stephon Marbury signed with Wilhelmina Sports, a division of Wilhelmina Models that plans to embark on an aggressive marketing campaign for the 23-year-old Nets guard. He is the only basketball star Wilhelmina represents.</p>
        <p>In June, Marbury parted acrimoniously with his agent, David Falk. Marbury was frustrated that he had no endorsements, although Falk said he resigned because Marbury created an uncomfortable working environment.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the president of Wilhelmina Models, Dieter Esch, and Marbury were laughing easily. The agency is negotiating two national contracts for Marbury, to be signed within the next three to six months, Esch said. Eventually, Marbury said, he will do some modeling himself.</p>
        <p>''This is a whole new world for me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Marbury, who negotiated a six-year, $70.875 million deal last year with Falk, will have his older sister, Marcia, serve as his manager, while Wilhelmina will take care of the marketing.</p>
