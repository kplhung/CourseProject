        <p>WOODS-Patricia Fay, on September 6, 2000 in San Francisco, CA of cancer after a short illness. She was the beloved mother of Wendy Luers, Ward, Cynthia and Susan Woods, loving grandmother of Kate and Alexandra Woods, Ramsay and Connor Turnbull, Max and Tatia Bauer &amp; great-grandmother to Rowan and India, loved by her sons-in-law William Luers, Myron Sugarman and Johannes Bauer and her daughter-in-law Priscilla Woods. She will be remembered fondly by her caregivers: Rosa Sandoval, Annie Vega, Marcenita Villegas and Rosemary Massey. Patsy, a third generation San Franciscan, was generous and important in the lives of her many nieces and nephews, cousins, and friends of all generations whom she welcomed with ease and style in the many places she made her home. She will be sorely missed by all whose lives she brightened with her happy spirit and contagious optimism and energy. And above all, we will all remember her humor, kindness and wonderful sparkling smile. The family suggests contributions to St. Anthony's Foundation, 121 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, Ca 94102 or Mount St. Joseph-St. Elizabeth, 100 Masonic Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94118. A memorial service will be held on October 20th at 3 PM at St. Dominic's Church, 2390 Bush Street, San Francisco followed by a reception.</p>
