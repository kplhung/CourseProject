        <p>SO you're ready to be a millionaire, or at least ready to play along with Regis from your couch. What do you do to make your television interactive?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, for technology that is meant to be simple, the answer right now is complicated and depends on which cable or satellite television company you use, if any. In some cases, interactive functions may appear on existing systems. Others may add more advanced features, like e-mail, Web surfing or special information services for extra fees. And for those who want to bypass their cable or satellite services, there are interactive features that can be added to any television that is near a phone line.</p>

        <p>SO you're ready to be a millionaire, or at least ready to play along with Regis from your couch. What do you do to make your television interactive?</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, for technology that is meant to be simple, the answer right now is complicated and depends on which cable or satellite television company you use, if any. In some cases, interactive functions may appear on existing systems. Others may add more advanced features, like e-mail, Web surfing or special information services for extra fees. And for those who want to bypass their cable or satellite services, there are interactive features that can be added to any television that is near a phone line.</p>
        <p>While all these services work with existing remote controls, the e-mail and Web surfing services also typically include a wireless keyboard to make entering text easier.</p>
        <p>BASIC INTERACTIVITY -- The easiest interactive television systems to use are those that are built into the set-top box that comes with all satellite and some cable services. People with relatively late-model boxes may already start seeing interactive features popping up. Perhaps the most common interactive systems in use today are electronic program guides, which let viewers see when programs are playing and order movies on satellite and a growing number of cable systems. These guides are increasingly the path to buying pay-per-view movies, which on sophisticated systems can be ordered to begin at any time and can also be paused, rewound and replayed like videocassettes. The guides are also showing signs of evolving into television portals, complete with shopping.</p>
        <p>Another growing system for interactive programs as well as advertising is Wink. It superimposes a red stylized ''i'' on the screen. Viewers can push a button on their remotes to see a simple overlay of text and graphics, which allows them to obtain more information or order merchandise. Wink, which does not charge users, is a relatively small program that can be downloaded to many advanced set-top boxes already in use. It is also being installed in 14 million homes, including those of some Time Warner customers in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Set-top boxes capable of these interactive services are usually bundled with more expensive cable plans that include many extra channels. These plans, often called digital cable because they use digital technology to squeeze all those networks down the existing cable wires, add $7 to $20 to a monthly cable bill. All satellite boxes in the United States are digital, and most of the newer ones will be upgraded for Wink.</p>
        <p>PREMIUM INTERACTIVITY -- Cable and satellite systems are offering an increasing range of interactive features, for additional fees. For example, EchoStar offers a $399 DishPlayer set-top box with Microsoft's WebTV and a video recorder. DirecTV will offer boxes linked to a new Microsoft service called Ulti mateTV and another with America Online's AOLTV.</p>
        <p>Cable companies are developing text services that display information about news, sports, weather and shopping. And others are offering a service that allows a television to send e-mail messages or to surf any site on the Internet, for another $5 to $10 a month. While this may be convenient for people who don't want home computers, many sites look awkward on the television screen. Even more features, like video games and video recording, will be available next year.</p>
        <p>STAND-ALONE SYSTEMS -- Viewers whose cable companies do not offer interactive features or who want the latest features can choose between two services, WebTV and AOLTV, which add interactivity to any television, as long as it's near a phone line. Both offer e-mail and Web surfing, and both offer interactive features synchronized to certain television programs. AOLTV also lets users chat and send instant messages to anyone logged on to any of America Online's services. WebTV costs $100 to $150 for the box and $25 a month for the service. The AOLTV box costs $250. The service is $15 a month for America Online subscribers and $25 a month for nonsubscribers. Of course, if viewers want all those extra channels and movies, they still need to have cable or satellite service.</p>
        <p>DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS -- These machines from TiVo and ReplayTV are sold mainly as an alternative to videocassette recorders; they both automatically record programs and allow people to pause live television. But they also include interactive program guides and may offer other interactive features in the future. These cost $400 to $800. TiVo adds a $10-a-month fee.</p>
        <p>DO IT YOURSELF -- Lug your PC or laptop into a room with a television and a phone jack to take advantage of the increasing number of services that synchronize special Web sites to broadcast programs. These include a block of shows on Wednesday night on TNT and football games on ABC. And this is how you can play along with Regis.</p>
