        <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn ruled yesterday that a New York City agency had failed to provide adequate services for thousands of people with AIDS and ordered the agency placed under federal oversight for three years.</p>
        <p>The judge, Sterling Johnson Jr. of Federal District Court, ruled that the agency, the Division of AIDS Services and Income Support, had ''chronically and systematically'' delayed or terminated subsistence benefits, including emergency housing, rent assistance, food stamps, Medicaid and other services, that it administers for about 25,000 New Yorkers who have AIDS or are H.I.V.-positive.</p>

        <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn ruled yesterday that a New York City agency had failed to provide adequate services for thousands of people with AIDS and ordered the agency placed under federal oversight for three years.</p>
        <p>The judge, Sterling Johnson Jr. of Federal District Court, ruled that the agency, the Division of AIDS Services and Income Support, had ''chronically and systematically'' delayed or terminated subsistence benefits, including emergency housing, rent assistance, food stamps, Medicaid and other services, that it administers for about 25,000 New Yorkers who have AIDS or are H.I.V.-positive.</p>
        <p>In his ruling, Judge Johnson wrote that the failures of the agency, an arm of the city's Human Resources Administration, had ''devastating consequences.'' He wrote that in many cases, the agency had terminated benefits like food stamps without notifying recipients.</p>
        <p>His ruling came three months after the conclusion of a bench trial in a class-action lawsuit brought in 1995 by Housing Works Inc., an AIDS awareness group that has long sparred with the Giuliani administration over city AIDS policies.</p>
        <p>''I've watched every day as our clients have suffered under this callous, awful administration,'' said Armen Merjian, a staff lawyer for Housing Works. ''This is the medication they depend upon to live, the food upon which they depend to feed themselves and their families, the housing they need to find shelter and fight off this mortal illness.''</p>
        <p>The case of Delilah Howard is typical, Mr. Merjian said. Ms. Howard, 47, a Housing Works client who is unable to work because of her illness, said in an interview yesterday that she found an apartment she could afford on her city housing subsidy, but lost the chance to rent it because the city agency took more than a month to approve her application for the benefit. On another occasion, Ms. Howard said, she found out from a grocery checkout clerk that her food stamp coverage had been terminated. Her caseworker was not in the office, she said, ''so I spoke to someone else, who told me there was nothing that they could do, that Albany cut my food stamps.''</p>
        <p>Under Judge Johnson's ruling, which takes effect immediately, people with complaints like hers will be able to take them to the federal magistrate judge appointed to monitor the agency, Cheryl L. Pollak, who has been managing the case by overseeing the exchange of documents and other evidence.</p>
        <p>Judge Pollak will not monitor the agency's day-to-day activities or policies. After reviewing complaints, she may recommend penalties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merjian said Housing Works and other advocates for people with AIDS would put together a system for reporting complaints.</p>
        <p>Michael Hess, the city's corporation counsel, said last night that the city would appeal the decision. He said it ignored important precedents and was ''confusing,'' because the judge did not explain what the city would have to do to comply with it.  Mr. Hess said the opinion ''is very flawed, with all kinds of mistakes,'' and was based on statistics from the mid-1990's that have little to do with how the agency operates now.</p>
        <p>''New York City provides more money and more services for AIDS-related people than any other city in the nation,'' Mr. Hess said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Merjian called the ruling a ''gigantic victory'' and said it could help people with other disabilities, since the case was brought under the federal Americans With Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act, another federal law guaranteeing rights for disabled people.</p>
        <p>''Any time you win under A.D.A., you create important precedent,'' Mr. Merjian said.</p>
        <p>The suit, Henrietta D. v. Giuliani, was one of several that Housing Works has brought against the Giuliani administration. Last October, the group won a unanimous ruling from the State Court of Appeals that the city was improperly requiring eligibility reviews of welfare clients who had already been accepted by the AIDS agency.</p>
        <p>In November, in another case brought by Housing Works, Justice Emily Jane Goodman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan found the Division of AIDS Services in violation of a city law requiring medically appropriate housing for AIDS patients and ordered it to make emergency placements within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>The class-action lawsuit decided yesterday was filed in response to the Giuliani administrations cutbacks in the Division of AIDS Services and Income Support, which was established in 1985 at the start of the AIDS crisis, during the administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch. Mr. Merjian said that while caseworkers had had an average of 34 clients before the cutbacks, the caseloads soon reached 60 per caseworker at some of the division's 10 centers.</p>
        <p>Judge Johnson's decision cited findings that in a third of its cases, the city took more than 30 days to provide emergency benefits that were required within 72 hours.  Among applicants for housing at one location, the agency failed to meet its own deadlines on more than three-quarters of the cases. It failed to pay rent on new apartments in 32 percent of cases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Merjian said that when the class action was filed, about 16,000 people were eligible for assistance; now, he estimated, 25,000 clients and 10,000 dependents relied on the city services.</p>
        <p>''When you're living with AIDS, chances are you're going to be a class member,'' he said. ''They have no choice but to be on the dole.''</p>
        <p>Richard Torres, a plaintiff who testified at the trial, said yesterday that the decision would have ''a great effect.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torres, 46, testified that after he was forced from his apartment by water damage in 1995, his caseworker did not help him find a new apartment or secure emergency housing. He was homeless until finding a Veterans Administration shelter.</p>
        <p>The agency is meant to help people, Mr. Thurman said, but ''they act as if it's their money, their stamps.''</p>
        <p>''The main thing,'' he said, ''is just getting people to do their jobs.''</p>
