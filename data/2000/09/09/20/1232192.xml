        <p>Trailing badly in statewide polls and outspent 3 to 1, David Johnson, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate here, figured the odds against his longshot campaign could not get much worse.</p>
        <p>Of course, that was before his Republican opponent, the incumbent Richard G. Lugar, was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in August for his work to help reduce Russia's nuclear arsenal.</p>
        <p>In the annals of underdog Senate races, Mr. Johnson's challenge is bobbing near the top. He picked his first political race to take on Mr. Lugar, a four-term senator, former presidential candidate and perhaps the most popular politician in Indiana history. An Indianapolis Star poll in early September had Mr. Lugar up by 50 points, with even Democrats narrowly favoring him.</p>
        <p>But none of this seems to faze Mr. Johnson, 48, a smart, affable corporate lawyer and political adviser, who dismisses talk that he has been offered as a sacrificial lamb by party leaders to keep Mr. Lugar from spending too much time and money helping other Republican candidates here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson is running a spirited, if somewhat anonymous, campaign  on the theme that Mr. Lugar, 68, has lost touch with what ordinary Hoosiers care about: education, health care and Social Security. With crop prices dropping, Mr. Johnson has also attacked the Freedom to Farm Act that Mr. Lugar championed to overhaul farm programs.</p>
        <p>Poring over his rival's record since 1994, Mr. Johnson found that Mr. Lugar voted 83 percent of the time with Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the staunch conservative Republican, and repeatedly voted against new school financing and prescription-drug coverage for the elderly. ''This is a guy who has just been missing in action, and at every opportunity has voted with the Jesse Helms wing in the Senate,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''This is not that kind of state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lugar scoffs at the criticism, first noting that he has visited all 92 counties in the state this campaign and then dismissing attacks on his record as selective procedural votes cooked up by Democrats to embarrass Republicans. Mr. Lugar, for instance, has proposed a plan for Medicare recipients to join a drug-buying club that would offer steep discounts.</p>
        <p>''If you're going to argue about being in touch, you have to offer some visible evidence that you've been to the communities, that you've met the leaders, that you know anybody,'' Mr. Lugar said. ''I've been there. He has not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lugar, despite his commanding lead, seems to be nervously peeking over his shoulder at his upstart's challenge, and says he is not taking the outcome for granted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lugar has raised more than $4 million -- compared with $1.5 million for Mr. Johnson -- and has scheduled several fund-raisers through October. Mr. Lugar skipped the Republican National Convention this summer to stay home and campaign.</p>
        <p>''I spent almost the entire month of August in Indiana to make absolutely sure that each of these counties was as secure and strong for our candidacy and other Republicans as possible,'' Mr. Lugar said.</p>
        <p>In one of his television advertisements, Mr. Lugar is running away from his own party, taking credit for his defense of the popular federal school lunch program against efforts by House Republicans to slash it.</p>
        <p>In the candidates' first televised debate in August, Mr. Johnson's attacks flustered the normally soft-spoken, unflappable senator. ''The thought that Senator Helms and I are somehow in bed together there in the Senate is just ludicrous on the face of it,'' said Mr. Lugar, clearly agitated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's big problem is that he is not well known. On paper and in person, he is an attractive candidate: son of a Presbyterian minister, Harvard Law School graduate, former Africa specialist on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, like Mr. Lugar, a Rhodes Scholar.</p>
        <p>But with Election Day fast approaching, Mr. Johnson is trying to accomplish in less than two months what Mr. Lugar has done over a quarter-century of public service: build a statewide name and reputation.</p>
        <p>Only recently did Mr. Johnson air his campaign's first television advertisement. The Democratic National Committee spent $250,000 on a television commercial criticizing Mr. Lugar's record on education and health care, but it never mentions Mr. Johnson by name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson's struggle was evident when he recently attended services at the Eastern Star Baptist Church, the state's largest African-American congregation. As more than 500 parishioners filtered into an elementary school that served as a makeshift sanctuary, Mr. Johnson shook hands and drew blank stares.</p>
        <p>''I haven't heard of him,'' said Crystal Crumes, a 34-year-old Internet recruiting specialist who considers herself a staunch Democrat.</p>
        <p>Political analysts are skeptical that there are enough compelling issues to give Mr. Johnson's campaign the boost it needs. The state's economy is booming and the unemployment rate is around 3 percent, below the national level.</p>
        <p>Nor is there any whiff of scandal to taint Mr. Lugar's respected record as a foreign policy expert, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and one-time mayor and school board member in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>''In any other state, David Johnson would be an A-list challenger,'' said Rachel Gorlin, a media consultant who produced the Democratic Party advertisement. ''But here, David's got to do everything right, and then have a lot of good luck.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Johnson is clinging to the coattails of the state's popular incumbent Democratic governor, Frank L. O'Bannon, who is expected to be easily re-elected. While no Democratic presidential candidate has carried Indiana since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, Democrats have controlled the governor's mansion here since 1988.</p>
        <p>The only advantage to a 50-point deficit in the polls, Mr. Johnson says cheerily, is that there is nowhere to go but up. If he can close that gap and generate momentum, Mr. Johnson said, a large Democratic turnout could propel him to an upset.</p>
        <p>''When I got into this race, people thought I was delusional,'' he said.  ''But it's entirely a question of being able to have a sufficiently amplified voice to get the message out that people have a choice this year.''</p>
