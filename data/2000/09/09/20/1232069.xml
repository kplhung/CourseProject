        <p>I LOVE the taste of lemon, and sometimes finish grilled or broiled poultry with just the fresh juice. But when I wanted to take advantage of the complex flavor of lemon, rind and all, I came up with this crisp-skinned Cornish hen.</p>
        <p>It's topped with lemon slices that brown nicely under the broiler and become sweet and tender enough to eat, rind and all. And it's drizzled with just enough balsamic vinegar to make you wonder where the extra flavor is coming from.</p>

        <p>I LOVE the taste of lemon, and sometimes finish grilled or broiled poultry with just the fresh juice. But when I wanted to take advantage of the complex flavor of lemon, rind and all, I came up with this crisp-skinned Cornish hen.</p>
        <p>It's topped with lemon slices that brown nicely under the broiler and become sweet and tender enough to eat, rind and all. And it's drizzled with just enough balsamic vinegar to make you wonder where the extra flavor is coming from.</p>
        <p>The technique is simple. Butterfly the hen, then cover the flesh side with very, very thin slices of lemon and cook until browned. Then, turn it over and brown the skin side before covering it with more lemon slices and browning them. A mandoline is best for slicing the lemons; it will deliver 15 or even 20 slices from each lemon.</p>
        <p>This recipe can also be made with a three-pound chicken; figure at least 10 minutes additional cooking time. The birds should brown slowly but steadily. If they seem to be incinerating, or not much is happening at all (you should hear cooking noises within just a couple of minutes), adjust the distance between the rack and the heat source.</p>
        <p>If you have an electric oven, chances are the heating element will cycle off when the oven becomes hot; you can counter this by leaving the oven door a little bit ajar while you're cooking, and moving the bird as far back in the oven as possible.</p>
        <p>BROILED CORNISH HENS WITH LEMON AND BALSAMIC VINEGAR  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>2 Cornish hens  1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 lemons  2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar, or to taste  Chopped parsley for garnish, optional.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the broiler, and adjust the rack to about 4 inches from the heat source. Use a sharp, sturdy knife to split the hens through their backbones; it will cut through without too much effort. Rub the skin side with olive oil. Flatten the hens in a broiling or roasting pan, skin side down, and liberally sprinkle the exposed surfaces with salt and pepper. Slice one lemon as thinly as you can (a mandoline is best for this) and lay the slices on the birds.</p>
        <p>2. Broil for about 10 minutes, or until the lemon is browned and the birds appear cooked on top; rotate the pan if necessary. Turn the birds over, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and return to the heat. Cook another 10 minutes, or until the skin is nicely browned. Meanwhile, slice the remaining lemon as thinly as possible.</p>
        <p>3. Lay the lemon slices on the skin, and broil  5 minutes. The lemons should be slightly browned and the birds cooked through; if not, cook a couple of minutes more. Drizzle with the balsamic vinegar, garnish with parsley and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
