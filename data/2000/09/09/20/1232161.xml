        <p>The judges who set policy for the federal court system voted today to oppose new limits on the ability of judges to attend privately sponsored seminars and educational programs.</p>
        <p>The vote by the Judicial Conference of the United States, a 27-member group that held its semiannual meeting at the Supreme Court today, came in response to a recent Senate bill to prohibit federal judges from accepting ''anything of value'' -- meaning reimbursement of expenses -- ''in connection with a seminar.''</p>
        <p>Such a ban was ''overly broad'' and raised ''potential constitutional issues,'' including the prospect of government censorship, the Judicial Conference said in a resolution adopted during its regular closed session. The resolution said the bill, sponsored by two Democratic senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin, could have the unintended effect of keeping judges from taking part in programs of bar associations and law schools.</p>
        <p>The two senators introduced the bill on July 27 after a report by Community Rights Counsel, a public interest law firm here, criticized federal judges for attending expense-paid seminars on economic and environmental issues sponsored by private groups that oppose much government regulation. The bill would increase financing  for the Federal Judicial Center, an arm of the court system that conducts research and training, to reimburse judges for the expense of attending seminars conducted in a manner that maintains ''the public's confidence in an unbiased and fair-minded judiciary.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference today at the Supreme Court, Chief Judge Ralph K. Winter Jr. of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, said the bill would require the center to examine not only the content and source of money for all seminars but also the ''litigation activities'' of the sponsor and anyone on the program.</p>
        <p>Judge Winter, the chairman of the Judicial Conference's executive committee, said the proposal appeared to call for ''explicit content regulation,'' which would ''very much alter the institutional role of the Federal Judicial Center'' and  impose ''a very draconian ban in one of the most sensitive areas of our public life, the marketplace of ideas.''</p>
        <p>In a report accompanying the resolution, the executive committee said the bill was a hasty and ''inappropriate response to a highly complex question'' that Congress should not address without holding hearings and inviting public participation. ''This is not a time for hasty legislation that may well be more dangerous than the concerns it is designed to allay,'' it said.</p>
        <p>Judge Winter also said the Judicial Conference would not necessarily oppose all Congressional intervention but that the judges could not respond to proposals that had not been made.</p>
        <p>The Judicial Conference concluded two years ago that judges should not participate in seminars if the sponsors or underwriters were involved or likely to be involved in litigation. Judges are required to report reimbursements as gifts on their annual financial disclosure forms.</p>
