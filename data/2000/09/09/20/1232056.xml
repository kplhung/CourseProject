        <p>THE clock in the dimly lighted control room flashes 20:00. J. R. Gant, the director, nods, an assistant pushes some buttons and the image of Regis Philbin  flashes on a bank of monitors on the wall as another episode of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' begins.</p>
        <p>Among the many video screens, there is one monitor that sets this room apart from nearly every other television studio in the world. It displays a graph that ticks up and down, counting the exact number of people who are tuned in to the program. That's possible because this room isn't producing ''Millionaire'' itself but an interactive game that 125,000 people a day play as they watch to see whether they can answer Regis's questions before the contestant does.</p>
        <p>For 50 years, television was something viewers just sat back and watched. Now a new crop of systems, collectively known as interactive television, allows people to use their remotes to take over some of the power of the director to control what appears on the screen.</p>
        <p>Interactive television, of course, is one of those World's Fair devices that has been just over the horizon for decades. But now the technology is beginning to catch up with the hype. This year, most of the major cable and satellite television companies will begin to roll out interactive systems, at least in test markets. And experts expect tens of millions of households to have access to some sort of interactive television in the next few years.</p>
        <p>''Interactive television will spread much more rapidly than either the Internet or cable,'' said Jack Myers, chief executive of Myers Reports, a television consulting firm.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the aspirations of these systems are becoming more realistic. Rather than trying to cram all the Internet's functions onto a TV screen, the newest versions of interactive television are focused on, well, television. The emphasis in most of the new systems is on letting users modify an existing program, either by superimposing text over the picture -- like a baseball player's statistics -- or by changing the image itself, letting the user decide, for instance, when to jump to an instant replay. Some systems, like the AOLTV service America Online is introducing for the holiday season, also realize that people already like to watch TV and talk about it at the same time, so they are splitting screens between programs and chat rooms about the programs.</p>
        <p>''Television is very compelling, and nothing competes with it, even the Internet,'' said Kevin Leddy, senior vice president for product development at Time Warner Cable. ''If you ask customers to choose between watching TV or reading text, the text application always loses.''</p>
        <p>This focus on letting television be television is a sharp departure from the long-hallowed notion of ''convergence,'' in which computers and television sets would gradually become indistinguishable.</p>
        <p>In fact, across the cultural spectrum, most of those people now being paid to think about how to turn the Internet into a paying entertainment medium are taking a very different tack. Rather than trying to Webcast video signals that have all the clarity of shadow puppet shows, they are focusing on simple animation, easily downloadable music and interactive games and other content that take advantage of the Internet's current strengths. What is emerging is a medium that is a great deal more passive and relaxing than surfing the Web, but one that gives users more control than a mere channel changer.</p>
        <p>''I have e-mail at work, but when I get home I want to sit back and don't want a screen 12 inches away from my face,'' said Joe Ripper, a steel buyer in Fort Worth who was asked by Charter Cable to be one of the first customers to test its version of the interactive television system known as Wink. He became an immediate fan and continues to use it to check the weather, read news and play games. While watching a wrestling match with his wife's grandson, he even used the system to order a hat emblazoned with the image of Goldberg, the boy's favorite wrestler.</p>
        <p>''I enjoy it because it's not like I'm just looking at a screen,'' he said. ''It's like there is someone in there, even though it is just a computer, paying attention to my requests.''</p>
        <p>The prospect of connected couch potatoes, relaxing with a finger always on a button hot-wired to a credit card account, is a powerful draw for television companies and advertisers. These companies are investing billions of dollars to build interactive television -- not because the world needs faster access to sports scores, but because they hope all those fingers on those remotes will soon be ordering pay-per-view movies as well as pizza, sports paraphernalia and much more.</p>
        <p>''Television is about emotion,'' said Henry Yuan, chief executive of TV Guide Gemstar, which is developing several interactive advertising systems. ''You see a cruise ship sailing off into a beautiful sunset, and you are moved. Now you can push a button and book the cruise before the next commercial comes on.''</p>
        <p>The Web Prompts Action  Delay by TV Companies Encourages Rivals</p>
        <p>There is no small irony that the most interactive television application in the United States so far -- ABC's enhanced programming -- requires users to interact through the Internet rather than directly through their televisions. ABC says it will move the interactivity of ''Millionaire'' and football games -- which includes on-demand statistics and a game that lets users predict the next play -- onto true interactive television systems when the cable companies and others actually put them into millions of homes.</p>
        <p>Why did the World Wide Web, which didn't exist when most of the interactive television systems were being designed, leap into more than one-third of American households? Exactly because the Internet wasn't planned, and no one in power thought it was important. As a result, the standards were open, allowing a torrent of innovation in garages and venture capital offices to create something that the big companies couldn't or wouldn't.</p>
        <p>The dozen companies that control the $250-billion-a-year broadcasting business have been working for years toward the day when all cable households have a cable box they can talk back through. But they haven't been exactly quick to summon the conviction and the capital needed to rebuild their systems to do so. It is only by the end of this year that the systems serving about three-quarters of the 60 million cable customers will have been upgraded for two-way communications, allowing the leaders like AT&amp;T and Time Warner to begin to roll out interactive television. And cable now faces more delays because Microsoft has not finished the elaborate software that is needed for the equipment.</p>
        <p>This failure to work on Internet time has created an opening for a host of other alternative television systems. These include cable's potent rivals, the DirecTV and EchoStar digital satellite systems, stand-alone interactive television services like WebTV and AOLTV, and interactive features being built into TV sets themselves. Then there's the emerging category of digital video recorders, like TiVo and ReplayTV, which have several built-in interactive features and the potential to compete head to head with the cable-  and satellite-based systems, especially for pay-per-view movies and custom advertising.</p>
        <p>But don't quit your day job because you have a great idea for an interactive television programming company. Unlike the open Internet, the only services that viewers can receive on these systems are those offered by the owners. In other words, nearly all the interactive programming will be done by companies like AT&amp;T, the News Corporation and Time Warner, the very companies that were trumped by the upstarts on the Internet.</p>
        <p>And every system has a different technical approach, which is creating headaches for programmers and advertisers that are powerful enough to have their services carried.</p>
        <p>''There are two or three major set-top box makers, three or four software companies, half a dozen system operators, so the permutations and combinations get to be very large,'' said Bahns Stanley, an executive vice president of the Weather Channel. ''Designing a service for each one is like starting another network.''</p>
        <p>What Viewers Want  Keeping the Best, Discarding the Rest</p>
        <p>Even as the technology stabilizes, it's still not clear what people want to do with their televisions other than sit back, relax and watch duplicitous ne'er-do-wells eat rats.</p>
        <p>One thing is clear: few people want to surf the Internet on their TV screens. That's certainly the implication of the tepid reaction to WebTV, which has attracted only slightly more than one million users in three years. Indeed, Microsoft is changing that product's name to UltimateTV to distance it from the Internet and focus more on video recording.</p>
        <p>''There is no demand for the Internet on television,'' said Michael Willner, the president of Insight Communications. ''People want their information spoon-fed to them.''</p>
        <p>Instead, cable companies are looking at services that work around the margins. They think, for instance, that people will want to use their televisions to get quick updates on news headlines and sports scores in between programs.</p>
        <p>And Insight, which has set up interactive systems in Rockford, Ill., and Columbus, Ohio, is betting that the best way to bring the Internet into the living room is to focus on the most local information: restaurants, garbage pickup schedules, high school sports. Teachers can even call in their class's homework. Some say this approach suits them fine.</p>
        <p>''I use the Internet a lot, to play games and for chat,'' said Susan McGee, a legal researcher in Rockford. But she says she finds the interactive TV system a better way to look up local restaurants and movie times.</p>
        <p>''On the Internet, you type in a word and get so much information,'' she said. ''The TV is the fastest way to find out what's on in our town.''</p>
        <p>Looking beyond these pure information services, more development is now focused on superimposing data over existing programs.</p>
        <p>Sports and game shows are obvious first targets. One-third of the WebTV customers play along with ''Jeopardy'' or ''Wheel of Fortune'' every week. And a similar percentage of the people watching soccer on the British Sky Broadcasting satellite service choose the interactive version, which offers a range of player statistics and the ability to switch among four camera angles.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, old movies and reruns of classic TV series attract many users, who want to take trivia quizzes.</p>
        <p>''I was watching 'The Dukes of Hazzard' on TBS and the little symbol came on the right of the screen,'' said Mr. Ripper in Fort Worth. ''They were having a trivia test. It was fun to play while I was watching. It's something you don't normally get.''</p>
        <p>It's much harder, however, to come up with a reason for someone to interact with a drama or even a situation comedy. NBC worked with the producers of ''Homicide'' to create elaborate interactive programming linked to the broadcast, with additional clues and even its own subplots. Users were not interested.</p>
        <p>''People didn't want to go deeper -- they were watching television,'' said Jonathan Boltax, who runs NBC's interactive TV group.</p>
        <p>What Viewers Will Pay For  Video on Demand Precedes Buying Spree</p>
        <p>If it's so hard to come up with compelling reasons for people to interact with their televisions, why bother?</p>
        <p>In the short run, the biggest opportunity for new revenue is for the cable systems to offer video on demand -- pay-per-view movies that can be ordered to start at any time. Typically, video-on-demand systems can mimic a videocassette recorder, allowing users to pause, rewind and replay the movies ordered for a 24-hour period.</p>
        <p>''Before, you watched what was scheduled to be on,'' said Hubert Baker, an auto wholesaler who subscribes to Insight's system in Rockford. ''Now if I watch it and I get a phone call, you can stop, answer the phone and start again.'' Insight found that the new system tripled pay-per-view movie sales in Rockford.</p>
        <p>The very earliest returns are coming in for the potentially bigger business of interactive advertising and what is being called t-commerce, turning every program into a big infomercial, so viewers can click to buy Regis's tie or get information on that new drug used on ''E.R.''</p>
        <p>On Wink, a system used on Time Warner cable in New York and soon to be introduced by DirecTV, more than 10 percent of viewers clicked to buy a DVD movie offered in a commercial by Disney. And some 40 percent entered a contest sponsored by Kay Jewelers, said Maggie Wilderotter, the company's chief executive.</p>
        <p>Coming next, Wink and others are starting to introduce systems that collect and use data about individual viewers to display different commercials to different viewers, or at least different overlays to different viewers. In this vision of utopia, single men will no longer be distracted by commercials for dowdy minivans when they can be tempted by the latest sports cars.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, though, interactive technology may well sap more advertising revenue from the industry than it creates. A big part of the appeal of personal video recorders like TiVo and ReplayTV and video on demand is the possibility for viewers to simply skip past commercials. And in any case, all these quizzes and statistics and chat rooms may well further distract viewers.</p>
        <p>That prospect is already high in the mind of Jonathan Leess, the ABC senior vice president in charge of the network's enhanced television service. That's why the interactive quiz for ''Millionaire'' continues during commercials, but with questions tied to the advertising. For example, viewers were recently asked to name Mazda's new sport utility vehicle right after the advertisement. About 94 percent of the ''Millionaire'' game players say they get up less during commercials than they did before.</p>
        <p>''The 30-second spot is our lifeblood,'' Mr. Leess said. ''Our whole objective here is to have people watch more of them.''</p>
