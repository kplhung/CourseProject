        <p>They were infatuated with and infuriated by Keyshawn Johnson before he had even put on a Jets uniform. From the beginning, the Jets understood he was different.</p>
        <p>Now, he is in a different uniform. When he lines up against them at wide receiver Sunday at Tampa Bay, forget the talk. Forget that he has overstayed his departure. Quite simply, he will represent one of the most formidable opponents the Jets will face this season.</p>
        <p>He got that way, in part, because he practiced for years against the Jets' secondary he will now try to scorch. With his new team, the Buccaneers, he has 14 receptions, including 8 this past Sunday against Detroit. He has only one touchdown, but he is averaging more than 21 yards a catch on third-down plays.</p>
        <p>With the receiver gone now, Chris Hayes, one of Johnson's best friends and the Jets' special teams star and backup safety, honors Johnson by keeping an autographed No. 19 Jets jersey in his locker.</p>
        <p>''I wore this in practice,'' Hayes said the other day.</p>
        <p>Well, then, why not wear it in the pregame warmups at Tampa Bay? ''Hey, that's an idea -- I might just do that,'' said Hayes, chuckling at the thought.</p>
        <p>He will not, of course. But Johnson remains a constant presence this week. It goes beyond the locker room, the conference calls and the endless news media attention. His presence is felt on the field, where free safety Kevin Williams and cornerbacks Marcus Coleman and Aaron Glenn prepare to meet up with him more than once.</p>
        <p>The Coleman-Johnson confrontation should be interesting, although it may not be the key matchup. Johnson will flip-flop with Tampa Bay's talented deep threat, Jacquez Green, from one side to the other, while Coleman and Glenn will remain in their respective positions on the right and left sides.</p>
        <p>''You're assuming a lot,'' Coach Al Groh said when asked whether Coleman would be Johnson's primary shadow.</p>
        <p>At 6 feet 2 inches and 210 pounds, Coleman is the biggest man in the Jets' starting secondary. Johnson is 2 inches taller, but his weight is the same as Coleman's. Johnson usually towers over cornerbacks and certainly is more massive than those he usually faces.</p>
        <p>''He's more of an old-school wideout,'' Coleman said. ''He knows how to get behind you. He knows how to grab and hold.''</p>
        <p>Did he do that to the Jets' defenders in practice?</p>
        <p>''That's where he perfected it,'' Coleman said.</p>
        <p>In practice, Johnson used to pick on cornerback Ray Mickens, who is 8 inches shorter. Everything that came Johnson's way, he caught. It was a mismatch, as it has often been in real games when Johnson goes against considerably smaller corners.</p>
        <p>Mickens, who is 5-9, is now the Jets' nickel back and could be in double-teaming situations against Johnson. Another player in the mix could be the backup safety Scott Frost, who is 6-3.</p>
        <p>''What Johnson does best is body positioning,'' Coleman said. ''He's good at mixing it up. Every DB thinks he'll outmaneuver Keyshawn, but he's faster than people think he is.''</p>
        <p>That element of surprise may have helped Johnson become a premier receiver on third down, but it will come as no surprise to Glenn. After all, he practiced against Johnson for four seasons.</p>
        <p>''He likes to push off,'' Glenn said.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets have brought back the 14-year veteran DWIGHT STONE to perk up the special teams squad.</p>
