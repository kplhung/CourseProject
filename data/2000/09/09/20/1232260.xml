        <p>A FARMER living on the RussianUkrainian border reads in the newspaper that national boundaries are about to be rejiggered in the postSoviet era. As a result, his village, in Russian territory all his life, will be considered part of Ukraine.</p>
        <p>''Great news!'' he says to his wife. ''Now we wont have to go through another miserable Russian winter.''</p>
        <p>This joke came to mind after hearing that New York City Transit officials want to change the method used to grade themselves on whether the buses and subway trains run on time. Under the proposed change, they would look pretty good.</p>
        <p>The share of trains deemed to be running on schedule, put most recently at 80.7 percent, would rise under the new system to 89.5 percent. The gain in bus service would look even better. Its reliability rating, now 56.4 percent, would soar to 76.7 percent.</p>
        <p>On some routes, the improvement would be almost magical. Take the M101 bus, which runs up and down Third and Lexington Avenues. Voil! Faster than Clark Kent can turn into Superman, its positive rating of 33.8 percent would become 68.7 percent.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but the trains and buses would be deemed cleaner. Instead of 44 percent of subway cars being judged litterfree, as now, the figure would rise to 67 percent.</p>
        <p>O.K., enough with the numbers. They will only make your head hurt. They also mask the fact that absolutely nothing will change for the most important person of all: the rider. That much is readily acknowledged by Albert W. OLeary, New York City Transits chief spokesman.</p>
        <p>''The trains are not going to come any faster or slower, and they are not going to be any cleaner or dirtier,'' he said. So what's the point?</p>
        <p>''We want a change that helps us manage better,'' Mr. OLeary said.</p>
        <p>On one level, you have to sympathize with the subwaymeisters. They now judge how they're doing by way of a measurement called ''service regularity.'' It is defined as follows:</p>
        <p>''The percentage of intervals between trips departing from all scheduled timepoints, not including terminals, which is within plus or minus 50 percent of the scheduled interval (for all scheduled intervals less than 10 minutes), or, within plus or minus five minutes of the scheduled interval (for scheduled intervals of 10 minutes or more).''</p>
        <p>Did you catch all that?</p>
        <p>We didn't think so.</p>
        <p>Here's a CliffsNotes version. A train is now considered on schedule if it arrives within 50 percent of the allotted time between it and the previous train. If Train B is supposed to pull into the station four minutes after Train A, it is on time as long as it shows up anywhere between two and six minutes later.</p>
        <p>This system is way too complicated, subway officials say. They want to shift to something called ''wait assessment.'' (Don't look for plain English here.) It would impose a basic three-minute rule. A train would be declared on time as long as it turned up no later than three minutes after its scheduled arrival. That same Train B would be on time even if it arrived not four but seven minutes after Train A.</p>
        <p>ONCE all the numbers are crunched, mediocre efficiency ratings are transformed --poof! --into passable grades. Yet passengers will feel not a whit of difference as they tap their feet waiting for overdue trains.</p>
        <p>''It's like grade inflation,'' said Gene Russianoff of the Straphangers Campaign, a riders advocacy group. The mass-transit managers, he said, will look better on paper, when what they should do is add trains and buses to handle increased ridership. Similar points were made by Michael T. Doyle, associate director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
        <p>Mr. OLeary rejects any suggestion that flim-flam may be afoot. ''If we were going to cheat, would we announce it?'' he said.</p>
        <p>Fair enough. But you have to wonder about a bureaucracy that defines three minutes late as on time. Three minutes can loom large. Let a rush-hour No. 4 train be that late, and thousands of riders will be stranded all along the line.</p>
        <p>It is enough to make one pine for the Tokyo subway, where precise, to-the-minute schedules are posted on every platform. Riders can see right away for themselves if the trains are running smoothly. In my five years of living in Tokyo, they always were. Not once did I see a train come even a minute late.</p>
        <p>Of course, if you expect that kind of efficiency in New York, you probably also think that Russian farmer will be basking in a mild Ukrainian winter.</p>
