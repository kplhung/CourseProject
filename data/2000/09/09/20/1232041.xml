        <p>FOR many entrepreneurs in the traditional entertainment industry, the Internet is viewed with tenuous curiosity -- or dread. Not so with Julann Griffin, one of the creators of ''Jeopardy'' and the former wife of Merv Griffin, who successfully merged her television game show with the Internet to introduce a popular interactive online game Web site.</p>
        <p>The site, www.boxerjam.com, offers unlimited free play of game shows and puzzles, including Strike A Match and Take 5. It has 600,000 registered users, most of whom are women, and averages two million unique users monthly, according to PC Data, the market research firm in Reston, Va. Boxerjam recently started an e-commerce initiative in which users can earn ''chips'' that can be redeemed for products and services at more than 40 companies.</p>

        <p>FOR many entrepreneurs in the traditional entertainment industry, the Internet is viewed with tenuous curiosity -- or dread. Not so with Julann Griffin, one of the creators of ''Jeopardy'' and the former wife of Merv Griffin, who successfully merged her television game show with the Internet to introduce a popular interactive online game Web site.</p>
        <p>The site, www.boxerjam.com, offers unlimited free play of game shows and puzzles, including Strike A Match and Take 5. It has 600,000 registered users, most of whom are women, and averages two million unique users monthly, according to PC Data, the market research firm in Reston, Va. Boxerjam recently started an e-commerce initiative in which users can earn ''chips'' that can be redeemed for products and services at more than 40 companies.</p>
        <p>Ms. Griffin moved to New York from Michigan in the 1950's to pursue an acting career and ended up a comedian for CBS Radio, where she met Merv Griffin. ''Jeopardy'' was born when she devised a way to quell the government's post-''$64,000 Question'' apprehension about game shows by providing contestants with the answers and then asking them to guess the questions.</p>
        <p>After her divorce in 1976, Ms. Griffin discovered that she could not acquire a credit card in her own name, so she helped found The First Woman's Bank of California. In 1989, she formed Jam productions with her sister Maureen Roberts, to adapt game shows to an interactive audience. They soon teamed up with Allen Cunningham and Temple Fennel, two computer programmers with a film company called Boxer Films. The result was Boxerjam, which was introduced on America Online in 1995 and went live on its own site in 1998.</p>
        <p>Ms. Griffin lives in Virginia. In between her duties as the executive vice president and director of game design at Boxerjam, she raises farm animals and tends her gardens. She recently spoke about her leap of faith from linear to new media.</p>
        <p>Q. TV networks in the 1980's weren't as enamored with game shows as they are today, but the idea of personal computers as an entertainment medium was still in its infancy. What made you decide to steer your company toward the Internet?</p>
        <p>A. In 1988 I read in The Wall Street Journal that within 10 years, games would probably be played on the PC. I was in business with my sister Maureen, and we'd go back and forth from California to New York trying to sell our shows for television and no one was buying at the time. So I called Maureen and said, ''How about doing games for the PC?'' She said, ''Great, what's a PC?'' I said I didn't know but as soon as I found out, I'd let her know.</p>
        <p>We then started to hunt for someone to program our games. Jack Fisk, Sissy Spacek's husband, had worked with Boxer Films' Temple Fennell and Allen Cunningham and suggested I see them. They had both come from the University of Virginia and were very familiar with computer programming and all the latest technology. We met and they liked the games plus were able to see where we were going. We formed a partnership in 1995, created a prototype and our first customer was AOL. At first we thought we'd do the games on CD-ROM, but companies were folding left and right, plus it involved millions and was very risky. At that time AOL had about one million subscribers and was excited that we actually created a game with the computer in mind. A lot of people were trying to take games from TV and twist them around to make them work for interactive, but that's a difficult thing to do.</p>
        <p>Q. Can you explain the difficulty of creating games for computers?</p>
        <p>A. When you are watching games on TV, there is an M.C. who is asking questions and you are watching people give answers, but you have no participation at all. What we did was make games interactive so that the questions would be answered by you. Our online games are designed with all the correct answers programmed into the game itself. There's no M.C. or anyone else to tell you what the answer is, and that's a liberating feeling.</p>
        <p>Q. This model works well with information based games. Which other traditional games are good candidates for the Internet and which are not?</p>
        <p>A. Card and casino games work well because there's no guessing right or wrong, and the computer tabulates the score. ''What's My Line?'' was a wonderful game, but the contestants have to ask questions. If programmers were to create this game, they would have no idea what a million people's questions would be.</p>
        <p>Q. Your audience is nearly 70 percent female. Why do you think women are so attracted to Boxerjam?</p>
        <p>A. Most men go after sports and role-playing games, so a lot of men haven't discovered us, though some have. Women have so much information, and they don't have the same structure in which to use it as men. You don't get rewarded that much in life for getting the kids to school on time, etc., but there's nothing like a game to make you feel good about yourself. You play and think, wow, I knew more than I thought I did.</p>
        <p>Q. You recently started an e-commerce initiative in which contestants can acquire chips on Boxerjam and  cash them in at a variety of sites. Was this a way to keep current with similar offers on other gaming sites?</p>
        <p>A. Yes. You must find a way to reward people, and this is one of the best ways to do it. You can't give a car to a million people a month, so you give them chips, and who knows, maybe one day we might have a car to give out randomly. We have certain strategic partners because e-commerce is very complicated.</p>
        <p>Q. Was it difficult for you to get used to the online business model of temporarily suspending profitability?</p>
        <p>A. Yes, it's very hard for me to put off making money because I come from the old world, so it's difficult to wait and I'm always pushing. However, you have to be reasonable, a dollar is still a dollar. We're really ramping up and should be profitable by the third quarter 2001.</p>
        <p>Q. What are your plans for Boxerjam and interactive entertainment?</p>
        <p>A. Cyberspace is so huge and there's so much room and potential. Right now we are creating games for online, though we have developed a game for interactive TV to be applied at the same time we post it online. However, the technology hasn't caught up with us yet, but we're ready. It's important to be ahead. If they have monitors on wastebaskets, we'll be there!</p>
