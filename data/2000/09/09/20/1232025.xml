        <p>IT is 9:30 on a Sunday night in southern Maine, and it is fairly safe to say that nowhere else in this state is someone doing brisk trade in backpacks, sunglasses and hunting supplies.</p>
        <p>But here at the around-the-clock mecca for outdoor goods and apparel, L. L. Bean employees ease toward the end of the second shift and make way for the overnight crew, much as they have for 49 years, the last time the store was closed.</p>
        <p>Throughout the night, shoppers will pull on the worn, wooden canoe paddles that serve as door handles and stroll into a showroom replete with live trout, stuffed bears and staid clothing. The store is the antithesis of high technology -- the last place one would expect to find the seeds of an e-commerce success story.</p>
        <p>But it turns out that L. L. Bean is, in fact, an e-commerce star that is outperforming all but a few companies in its category on the Web. It has risen to that level by virtue of two core characteristics of the company: a stubborn adherence to customer service and a steadfast refusal to let excessive technological wizardry interfere with its shoppers' experience on the Web site.</p>
        <p>''Simple and slow'' have been the watchwords of the company's growth on the Internet, much as they have been the touchstones of the overall company's growth since it began selling by mail in 1917.</p>
        <p>In the mid-90's, when the Internet presented itself as a sales tool, L. L. Bean was in need of help. The cost of paper had leaped 57 percent between late 1994 and 1995 -- a nightmare for any catalog company. The Postal Service had just imposed its third increase in seven years, leaving rates 89 percent higher than in 1988.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the Japanese yen had collapsed, taking with it what had been a booming market for the company. Add to this an increase in competition from other catalog companies, and the book on L. L. Bean's decades-long run of 20 percent revenue growth was over.</p>
        <p>''We thought the sky was falling,'' said Christopher J. McCormick, senior vice president at L. L. Bean.</p>
        <p>One way the company responded was to turn to the Web, ''as a defensive move,'' Mr. McCormick said.</p>
        <p>The strategy: use the Internet to reach households outside the Northeast, which accounted for most of the company's sales, and to attract younger shoppers. The retailer had some advantages over other dot-com companies, including its well-known name, 200 million catalogs each year in which to advertise the Web site and a distribution system capable of shipping more than 12 million packages annually.</p>
        <p>What it lacked was expertise in bits and bandwidth, so the company set out to hire technological expertise and educate its existing employees. That it did so with its typical slow-and-steady approach brought some criticism from analysts, who mistakenly expected the company to shed its flannel shirt and corduroy pants in favor of a silicon suit.</p>
        <p>Its stodginess notwithstanding, the company has emerged as a leader in the online apparel category. Its Internet site has become the fourth most-visited apparel site on the Web, according to Media Metrix, an Internet audience measurement firm, trailing only Oldnavy.com, Gap.com and Victoriassecret.com.</p>
        <p>The Web site is expected to account for about $218 million, or 16 percent, of L. L. Bean's sales this year. The site has also helped reduce the cost of processing orders and returns.</p>
        <p>In doing so, the company has bucked conventional wisdom, which says that Internet shoppers are generally not ready to spend lots of money on apparel. That category is projected to attract sales of just $1.6 billion, according to Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more to the point, online apparel sales will account for less than 1 percent of the total market, compared with online sales of computers, which make up 23 percent of total sales, and books with 11 percent, according to Shop.org, an industry group.</p>
        <p>Analysts offer several reasons for the lag in apparel sales, including the inability of companies that make computer monitors to build screens that accurately and consistently convey fabric colors.</p>
        <p>Retailers have also found that many customers use the Web to browse, but feel more comfortable trying on clothes at the store rather than ordering clothes over the Internet that might not fit.</p>
        <p>But L. L. Bean has managed to paddle against that current, despite the fact that it was relatively late to online selling, despite the fact that other dot-coms lured several senior executives from its ranks, and despite the fact that its Web site was often criticized for being slow or short on innovation.</p>
        <p>''We're a meat and potatoes company,'' said Mr. McCormick, one of the few company employees who wears a tie. ''There's no sizzle here. So we'd rather be late in rolling out some hot new feature -- and get it right -- than be first and get it wrong.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCormick pointed out that several of L. L. Bean's competitors introduced online services last year that let customers talk with representatives, only to pull them back when customers complained about how poorly they worked.</p>
        <p>The company will roll out its own version later this year, he said, but only after being assured that the system can deliver the same level of service the company delivers offline.</p>
        <p>Which points out the company's raison d'etre. While Internet shopping has spawned a million horror stories about customer service, L. L. Bean has managed to sustain customer service standards that are among the most demanding of any retail operation.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Spaulding, the company's vice president for customer satisfaction, maintains those standards from an office inside a sprawling customer service center in Portland.</p>
        <p>The ability to recruit a pool of employees, Ms. Spaulding said, ''who love to serve customers in a way they'd like to be served'' has been crucial to maintaining good customer service.</p>
        <p>Retailers selling on the Internet have found that task to be difficult at times, particularly during the last two holiday seasons, when demand exceeded e-tailers' expectations and order-processing abilities. L. L. Bean had no such problems, its executives said, partly because it has such vast experience handling seasonal fluctuations.</p>
        <p>The company's customer service staff swells to 3,200 from 1,200 during the holidays. And notably, those workers consist largely of people who return year after year. As for the standards they must meet, e-mail messages are answered within four hours, on average, and always by a human.</p>
        <p>L. L.Bean also does not evaluate customer service representatives based on the average length of their calls, unlike many other companies, or on the revenue they generate.</p>
        <p>''What's a good length of time to handle a call?'' Ms. Spaulding said. ''There isn't a good number. If you need to spend an hour on the phone, you spend an hour.''</p>
        <p>On the Web, in particular, that ethic has translated to a loyal customer base. The company will not disclose statistics of repeat buyers but said the lifetime value of its Internet customers was about 30 percent greater than the industry average.</p>
        <p>Data like that is helping to breathe some life into the company's overall business, Mr. McCormick said, as year-to-date revenue is the best in 16 years.</p>
        <p>''The Web is the fastest-growing, most profitable source of revenue for us,'' he said. ''And it's been the primary area for generating new customers.''</p>
        <p>To continue that growth, Mr. McCormick said the company would broaden its Internet product line next spring to appeal to younger customers.</p>
        <p>The average catalog customer's age is 50, he said, compared with about 40 for the average Web customer.</p>
        <p>''The trick is to come up with merchandise to appeal to the Web audience without alienating our core customers,'' Mr. McCormick said. He declined to say what types of merchandise the company was considering.</p>
        <p>COMPANY executives are also speaking the language of many Internet merchants when they talk about a future of ''multichannel'' retailing, involving not only catalog and Web operations but also traditional stores. Under the strategy, retailers are available to customers no matter where the customer is, and no matter when they want help.</p>
        <p>But it is an expensive approach, given that L. L. Bean's second retail store, which opened in July in McLean, Va., cost $12 million. The company plans to open 12 to 15 stores in the next five years.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that might not be enough.</p>
        <p>''Does it make sense for Bean to leverage their franchise into retail stores?'' said Barbara Miller, a retail analyst with Goldman, Sachs. ''Yes, if they're doing it where their customers are, and using it as a way to advertise to a broader base of customers.''</p>
        <p>''Whether they present a threat to the competition,'' Ms. Miller said, ''depends on how big they become, and 12 stores by 2005 isn't much. We're looking at a marginal effort, versus monumental ones by others.''</p>
        <p>So it may take more years before the company is the prototype of the multichannel retailer, if indeed the company decides that is the right direction.</p>
        <p>Either way, the slow road is seemingly L. L. Bean's preferred route, as long as customers continue to follow along. And given that the company's Web effort continues to succeed, the company can perhaps afford to take its time.</p>
