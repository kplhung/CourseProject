        <p>Recent outbreaks of the West Nile virus affecting horses in the eastern United States and France forced the cancellation yesterday of the world singles driving championship scheduled for the United States Equestrian Team Training Center in Gladstone, N.J., Oct. 18 to 22.</p>
        <p>The cancellation notice was issued after the European Union imposed new restrictive conditions on the return of horses to Europe from areas where the disease has been detected. The new rules affected horses from Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Britain, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland that had been invited to compete in the three-phase competition.</p>

        <p>Entries were also expected from Argentina, Australia, Canada and the host United States.</p>
        <p>The restrictions prohibit a horse's return to Europe if it has been within 30 miles of any case of West Nile virus within 15 days of its intended shipment.</p>
