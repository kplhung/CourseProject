        <p>MALLEN-Anthony P. On September 17, 2000. Beloved son of the late Bernard J. and Elizabeth Mallen. Cherished brother of Edward of Andover, MA, and the late Sr. Angela Mallen and the late Maria Mallen Hefele. Dearest uncle of Jessica, Noel, Lauren, Michael and Ian. Mass of Christian Burial on Thursday, St. Ignatius Loyola Church, 980 Park Avenue at 84th Street, 10 AM. Interment Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Hawthorne, NY. In lieu of flowers, donations in his memory may be made to the Center for Special Studies at New York Presbyterian Hospital, 526 East 68th St., Box 566, New York City, NY 10021, or D.I.F.F.A., 150 West 26th Street, Suite 602, New York City, NY 10001.</p>
        <p>MALLEN-Anthony Pierce. The staff of the Center for Special Studies deeply mourns the loss of Tony Mallen. Over the past 14 years, Tony selflessly devoted much of his time and talent to creating clinical spaces that were warm, dignified and therapeutic. His beautiful vision became a comforting gift to thousands of very sick and needy people. He was a unique and wonderful friend. Jonathan Jacobs, M.D. Medical Director Samuel Merrick, M.D. Associate Medical Director Jennifer Lytton, Program Dir.</p>
        <p>MALLEN-Anthony Pierce. The current and past Board of Trustees and staff of the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS are deeply saddened by the loss of founding board trustee Tony Mallen. A loyal friend to DIFFA, Tony was a deeply committed supporter of the Foundation's effort to raise critical funds for AIDS service organizations. Tony's contribution to DIFFA will long be remembered.</p>
