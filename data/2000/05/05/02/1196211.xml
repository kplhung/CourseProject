        <p>In announcing on Thursday that he had prostate cancer, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani paused to make a pitch that all men have the test that revealed the early signs of his disease.</p>

        <p>In announcing on Thursday that he had prostate cancer, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani paused to make a pitch that all men have the test that revealed the early signs of his disease.</p>
        <p>The blood test measures levels of a protein called prostate-specific antigen, or P.S.A., which often rise when prostate cancer strikes. ''I urge everyone to get the P.S.A. test,'' Mr. Giuliani said at the news conference. ''If the P.S.A. is normal or low, you don't have a problem. If it's high, then you have. You should have it tested and find out.''</p>
        <p>Two new studies have provided strong, though not conclusive, evidence that P.S.A testing can reduce deaths, and most prostate cancer patients, like Mr. Giuliani, are glad they had the test. ''That's one of the most important things as far as I'm concerned,'' said Robert Magnini of Staten Island, whose prostate cancer was diagnosed last year. ''I'm willing to take any test that tells you what your health is, especially the P.S.A.''</p>
        <p>Yet many medical organizations and experts on prostate cancer remain equivocal about when, or even if, the screening test should be given. Their uncertainty reflects a continuing debate about whether the test is worthwhile given that, especially in older men, prostate cancer can be an indolent disease unlikely to cause lasting harm to the health, while its treatment can often produce serious side effects like impotence and incontinence.</p>
        <p>And while some experts praise the tests as contributing to the sharp recent decline in deaths from prostate cancer, others attribute the decline, at least in part, to advances in treatment.</p>
        <p>So the American College of Physicians offers this guidance to doctors: ''Rather than screening all men for prostate cancer as a matter of routine, physicians should describe the potential benefits and known harms of screening, diagnosis and treatment, listen to the patient's concerns and then individualize the decision to screen.''</p>
        <p>The American Urological Association's ''best practice policy'' recommends that the decision on testing be left to the patient.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Ian Thompson, chairman of the division of urology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, the chairman of the panel that wrote the policy, said he now regarded P.S.A. screening more favorably. ''I was originally very much a skeptic,'' Dr. Thompson said. But the death rate from prostate cancer has dropped sharply in recent years, and Dr. Thompson said the screening was the ''only reasonable explanation'' for the reduction.</p>
        <p>Since 1991, the death rate from prostate cancer has dropped 16 percent among white men. Among black men, who contract prostate cancer at higher rates, the death rate has dropped nearly 11 percent since 1993.</p>
        <p>The blood test became common in the late 1980's and early 1990's, and a study of Medicare recipients by researchers at the National Cancer Institute found that, by 1994, about half of American men 65 or older had had at least one.</p>
        <p>''The majority of American medical organizations have not made up their minds about this test, although the majority of Americans have,'' said Dr. Otis W. Brawley, director of the National Cancer Institute's Office of Special Populations Research.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the debate about the test persists because while the disease is widespread among older men, it is usually harmless. In autopsies of men over 50, about one in three show signs of prostate cancer, but up to 80 percent of the tumors are microscopic or deemed unlikely to spread.</p>
        <p>Prostate cancer will be diagnosed in an estimated 184,500 men in the United States this year, making it the second most common type of cancer among men, after skin cancer. The disease kills about 30,000 men a year nationwide.</p>
        <p>But if a screening test revealed mostly microscopic or slow-growing prostate cancers, that would lead to needless worry and unnecessary treatment, since many of those tumors, it is believed, will never spread.</p>
        <p>''That's not what we're finding with P.S.A. testing,'' said Dr. Thompson. Most of the tumors discovered by the test have been the faster growing, more dangerous type, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thompson said the urological association and other medical organizations would probably review more recent studies and ''look at whether those recommendations should be revised.''</p>
        <p>In a study in the March issue of Epidemiology, Dr. Brawley and two other researchers at the National Cancer Institute found that, in 1997, the prostate cancer death rate for white men under 85 in the United States had fallen below what it had been in 1986, the first year the P.S.A. test was used for screening. In men 60 to 79, the 1997 death rate was lower than in any year since 1950.</p>
        <p>One explanation that has been offered for the rise of prostate cancer deaths between 1986 and 1991 is that the publicity surrounding the test may have made doctors more likely to ascribe prostate cancer as the cause of death rather than other contributing conditions. The subsequent fall in death rates could just be doctors' returning to earlier practices.</p>
        <p>But now, Dr. Brawley said, ''we're starting to have evidence that there may be a positive to prostate cancer screening and treatment.''</p>
        <p>In another study, Dr. Peter Boyle of the European Institute of Oncology in Milan and Dr. Georg Bartsch of the University of Innsbruck in Austria looked at Tirol, an Austrian state, which has offered free screening since 1993 to all men 45 to 74.</p>
        <p>They found that 70 percent of the eligible men in Tirol had been given at least one test, and that in 1998, the prostate-cancer death rate was 42 percent below what would have been expected.</p>
        <p>Dr. Boyle and Dr. Bartsch will present their findings this week at the meeting of the American Urological Association in Atlanta. They have also submitted a paper to The Lancet, a medical journal.</p>
        <p>None of the researchers describe their findings as proof that the tests save lives. The drop in deaths ''might be due to screening,'' Dr. Brawley said. ''It might be due to the fact we've learned to treat this disease better, and it might be due to both. My belief is it is a combination of both, but I don't know.''</p>
        <p>More definitive answers await the completion of studies that compare the survival rate of men who get the blood tests to those who don't. Results from the studies are years off.</p>
        <p>Some skeptics, like Dr. Harold C. Sox, chairman of the department of medicine at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., remain unconvinced.</p>
        <p>The decline in death rates is happening too soon to be explained by the screening, he said. Prostate cancer usually takes years to spread, so most of the men who received diagnoses of prostate cancer by taking the test during the late 1980's and early 1990's would still be alive anyway. ''I don't understand what's going on,'' he said, ''but I don't think it's because of P.S.A. screening.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Sox was the chairman of the United States Preventive Services Task Force when it recommended against routine prostate cancer screening several years ago. ''There isn't any evidence that screening has any benefits,'' Dr. Sox said. ''But there's quite a bit of evidence that the consequences of screening for some patients, namely radical prostatectomy, have some harms. Unproven benefits and proven harms. That's why we recommended against it as a routine practice.''</p>
        <p>Prostatectomy, removal of the prostate, often leads to impotence and incontinence. Radiation and hormone therapy can also have strong side effects.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sox said he could not comment on the Tirol study because he had not seen it.</p>
        <p>The recommendation to tell men about the test and let them decide is a reasonable one, said Dr. Sox, a specialist in internal medicine. But patients need to realize that the decision involves more just getting the blood test.</p>
        <p>In counseling patients, he said, ''What I do is to say that if you get screened, and have an abnormal P.S.A., then we're going to have to face the question whether you need a biopsy or not. And if you have a biopsy and it's positive for cancer, then you're going to have to decide whether you're willing to go for treatment. So when you're thinking about screening, you're really thinking about a couple of downstream decisions.''</p>
