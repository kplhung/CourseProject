        <p>At the end, the murdered Desdemona in her pinnacled gold headdress rises again to gaze at her fate as her desperate husband and killer, Othello, kneels before her in a silent plea not for forgiveness but for punishment.</p>
        <p>Thus concludes a new retelling of Shakespeare's ''Othello'' in the refined and ancient vocabulary of classical Khmer dance, and it confronts Cambodia's tortured society with a difficult message: Take responsibility for your evil deeds.</p>
        <p>This month, in the still-ravaged and poverty-ridden capital of this tiny Southeast Asian nation, an expatriate Cambodian dancer and choreographer has returned from the United States with a jolt of modernity cloaked in the rigidly beautiful forms of the past.</p>
        <p>The stated aim of the choreographer, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro, 32, is to build a cultural bridge between her two worlds by presenting a story from classical Western culture in the great classical art form of Cambodia.</p>
        <p>''Samritechhak,'' which means ''Dark Prince,'' is a homage to her teachers and her tradition as well as an attempt to enrich the nation she left nearly a decade ago with the vision she has gained in the United States.</p>
        <p>With a $30,000 grant from the Irvine Foundation in California, she is staging her creation with about 30 dancers, musicians and singers from Cambodia's Royal University of Fine Arts.</p>
        <p>Her venture has been received with a cautious welcome.</p>
        <p>''A monkey in a cage is not as smart as a monkey in the forest,'' she quoted her uncle, a leading dance teacher and patron of the arts, as counseling her on her journey. But at a recent rehearsal, dressed all in white and fluttering a black bamboo fan, her uncle, Chheng Phon, remained quietly reserved about the production of his young protege. ''It takes courage to try this,'' he said, speaking in French. ''For now I have no opinion. I await the result.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Shapiro bows to his opinion. One quality she has not lost in her transition to the West is reverence for her elders and her culture.</p>
        <p>''As a young Cambodian artist I do not have the privilege to change anything,'' she said. ''My ancestors created something unique to history. I only have the privilege to try to make it better. I think I would be a criminal if I did anything to destroy it.''</p>
        <p>But in a remark that did seem to reflect the vibrant artistic scene of her new home, California, she said she hoped to ''expand the vocabulary of dance, to make it relevant and significant to Cambodian audiences of today.''</p>
        <p>The choreography of Ms. Shapiro's ''Othello'' is exquisitely true to the ancient form, with its complex and difficult movements, its glittering costumes that send bouncing sprays of reflection onto the walls, and its rhythmic, quavering melodies.</p>
        <p>She has adapted the story to be sung by a traditional chorus, but even here she has used only familiar traditional melodies. Her boldest innovation in the form itself, Ms. Shapiro says, is to lengthen the rhythmic step of the dancers just the tiniest bit to suggest the rocking of ocean waves.</p>
        <p>But no matter how fixed the art form, every new artist brings himself to it. And like everyone of her generation, Ms. Shapiro has lived through one of the greatest traumas in her nation's history, the brutal reign of the Communist Khmer Rouge, which was responsible for the deaths of more than a million people from 1975 to 1979.</p>
        <p>Now, perhaps as a result of her experience in America, perhaps not, she has something to say to her countrymen. Cambodian men who have seen her production say they find Othello's suicide a sign of weakness, particularly in a military leader, Ms. Shapiro said.</p>
        <p>''I have been thinking about this, and there is probably something Cambodians can learn from 'Othello,' and that is that you have to be responsible for your actions,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''The Khmer Rouge today never say they were responsible for killing millions of Cambodians. 'Othello,' regardless of his accomplishments in his military career, punishes himself severely for his mistake in killing an innocent person. And in the story the last word Othello says is not, 'Please forgive me.' It is 'Punish me.' ''</p>
        <p>It is a strong statement to make in today's Cambodia, where powerful men are rarely punished. Most of the aging leaders of the Khmer Rouge remain free, and most of society's leaders accept their suggestion to ''let bygones be bygones.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Shapiro's introduction of a foreign story, not to mention what many here see as a foreign notion of accountability, troubles some Cambodians. In a recent interview, a reporter from the daily newspaper Rasmei Kampuchea repeatedly asked her about her introduction of alien elements into an art form that has been handed down painstakingly from teacher to pupil over the generations. ''This is not just my concern but the concern of many people,'' the reporter said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shapiro responded that Cambodian classical dance itself had roots in India and that the central stories it recounts -- with their many similarities to the themes of ''Othello'' -- are taken from the Ramayana, the great Indian epic.</p>
        <p>She is not an alien to Cambodian culture. She was a child during the time of the Khmer Rouge, and she was one of the first youngsters to be trained in dance in the early 1980's when the few surviving court dancers struggled to bring their art form back to life.</p>
        <p>In 1991 she married an American writer, John Shapiro, and moved to California, where she has devoted herself to Cambodian culture as a dancer, teacher and administrator of cultural programs in Long Beach.</p>
        <p>She said she had carried a sense of guilt for leaving her teachers and fellow dancers behind in the threadbare academy. Her production of ''Othello'' is in part an effort to make amends.</p>
        <p>''As a Cambodian artist I feel somehow guilty that I left,'' she said. ''After the Khmer Rouge time my teachers worked so hard to teach my generation, and they hoped that we would take over responsibility for preserving the dance here. And then I left. They were wasting their energy because their student was not useful to them.</p>
        <p>''But then I thought, well, I'm not the best dancer in school. Probably I can learn something more in the United States and in the future I can serve Cambodia better.''</p>
        <p>Her ideas emerge most strongly at the end of the dance she has choreographed. Aware that it is not proper in Cambodian tradition for characters to die at the end, she resurrects them in a moment that challenges both traditions.</p>
        <p>''At the end they rise and become like sculptures,'' she said. ''Their decay is only physical. I want to say that Desdemona moves on, whether she forgives Othello or not. Her meditative expression contains deep resentment. That is the Cambodian people of today. They are moving on, but they are not forgiving the Khmer Rouge.</p>
        <p>''And Othello is at her feet, taking responsibility for his actions, unlike other Cambodian leaders, who just point their fingers at each other.''</p>
