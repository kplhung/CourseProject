        <p>Today we're going to take a break from the unending excitement of the presidential race to talk about hog lagoons.</p>
        <p>Industrial livestock farming is probably not a big problem in your neighborhood, but really, people, how can you resist a controversy in which the villain is called Big Pork, and the possible repercussions include flesh-eating algae? If hog farming weren't a political issue, it would be a TV movie in sweeps month.</p>
        <p>It's already played a role in today's North Carolina gubernatorial primary. ''If I'm elected governor we're going to end hog lagoons,'' vowed Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker in a famous TV ad.</p>
        <p>''Hog lagoons'' sound like pigs in bathing suits with mermaid tails, swimming around a la Esther Williams. Actually lagoon is a fancy term for a humongous pit of manure. It's a critical element in the brave new world of pork production, in which hogs are often owned by the packers but raised by contractors in a system that bears a striking resemblance to a fast-food franchise. One of the great features of the system is that while the big guys own the hogs, the little contractors own the waste. It drains into lagoons, and if one of them ruptures or overflows or leaks, do not go looking to the packer for restitution.</p>
        <p>''There are different smells to it. One day it might smell like ammonia. Another day it might have an almost burning-type smell that hurts your nose,'' said Karen Priest, a North Carolina homeowner who woke up one morning and discovered that 7,300 hogs and two lagoons had moved in next door.</p>
        <p>In many places you can't put up a tree house without somebody seeking an injunction. But in North Carolina, thanks to the tireless efforts of a former state senator named Wendell Murphy, monster hog farms had free right-of-way into the countryside. By a remarkable coincidence, Mr. Murphy happened to be a major hog producer himself, as well as a great pal and major contributor to Jim Hunt, the outgoing governor.</p>
        <p>Thanks to its hospitable attitude, over the last decade North Carolina has been inundated with oversized hog farms and their lagoons, along with the largest meat-packing plant in the world. They're crammed into  the eastern section of the state, an area that is made up in large part of wetlands and flood plains.</p>
        <p>Let's put the hog lagoons in the flood plains. People, is that great planning or what?</p>
        <p>Nitrogen from animal wastes seems responsible for the sudden appearance of a flesh-eating algae known as Pfiesteria in state waters. During one particularly grisly period in the mid-90's, North Carolinians were discovering piles of fish, laden with sores and gasping for breath, on the riverbanks.</p>
        <p>''I want to see the scientific evidence that says it's swine waste that creates this problem,'' said Al Tank of the National Pork Producers Council. There are, of course, other potential culprits. But except for private golf courses, you'd be hard pressed to name any that have as little redeeming social value.</p>
        <p>Besides the smell and the environmental impact, the big farms are driving small hog producers out of business. Pork prices for the consumer aren't dropping. The hogs  can't be enjoying their lives -- ''Where is Kim Basinger when we need her?'' asked Ms. Priest. To top it all off, the jobs created at the contract farms and meat-packing plants are so lousy that even residents of a poor, rural area won't take them.</p>
        <p>You'd think that the candidates for governor would be leaping over each other to take on this issue. They're all middle-aged lawyers, so interchangeable that their own mothers might be hard pressed to cull one from the herd, and this pig thing is definitely the most interesting aspect to the race. But the two Democrats have moved on to the more traditional topics of education and character assassination. The Republicans have kept their distance altogether.</p>
        <p>Maybe the only thing to do is go national. Next time Al Gore or George Bush comes to your town, ask him what he'd do to crack down on hog lagoons. One of them might have an answer, and at least it might liven things up.</p>
