        <p>Gov. George W. Bush can only hope that his meeting next week with Senator John McCain goes as well as Mr. McCain's meeting with Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain met on Sunday for about 20 minutes with Mr. Gore at the Naval Observatory in Washington, the vice president's official residence. Both were appearing on CNN's ''Late Edition,'' which was being filmed at the residence. When Mr. Gore learned on Saturday that Mr. McCain would be under his own roof on Sunday, he called the Arizona senator and invited him to come over early for a private chat.</p>
        <p>''We're friends,'' Mr. Gore told reporters later, noting that the two had served in the House and Senate together. ''It's not that complicated.''</p>
        <p>He said he understood that Mr. McCain, who has suspended his own presidential campaign, would be endorsing Mr. Bush, a fellow Republican, for president. But ever since Mr. Gore locked up the Democratic nomination, he has been invoking Mr. McCain's name and making an overt play for his independent-minded supporters.</p>
        <p>On Sunday night, Mr. Gore seemed eager to fill reporters in on the details of their get-together, uncharacteristically allowing camera crews to film him on his airplane discussing the matter as he flew from Boston to Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said the two discussed campaign finance reform, Mr. McCain's signature issue and one that Mr. Gore is advancing in his campaign.</p>
        <p>''We talked about how to move the issue forward,'' the vice president said, adding that he expected future sessions with Mr. McCain on the subject.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has said the McCain-Feingold proposal to eliminate so-called soft money from campaigns would be his No. 1 domestic initiative, a move some critics suspect is an effort to inoculate himself against criticism that his own fund-raising has been too aggressive. The Sunday session thus struck some as an effort by Mr. Gore to bask in Mr. McCain's credibility on the issue, or what the political columnist Mark Shields calls ''innocence by association.''</p>
        <p>The vice president also wanted to signal that he could work with Republicans, a theme that Mr. Bush has emphasized recently while suggesting that Mr. Gore was excessively partisan.</p>
        <p>''I will regularly and routinely reach across party lines,'' Mr. Gore said on Sunday night, adding that his ''natural instincts'' were to work in a bipartisan manner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore went even further in this direction by suggesting, in answer to a question, that he might even name a Republican as his vice president. ''I think that's unlikely,'' he said, but ''I would not rule it out.''</p>
        <p>While the cameras were still rolling, Mr. Gore also poked fun at his own comments about the Elian Gonzalez case, which has caused him much political heartache.</p>
        <p>But the biggest laugh came when Mr. Gore referred to a ''bit part'' that he had played in a well-received video that President Clinton had made to show at the annual White House correspondents' dinner on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>A reporter on the plane remembered that Mr. Gore had made a brief appearance in the video but said, ''I've forgotten what it was,'' inadvertently summarizing Mr. Gore's longtime difficulty in establishing himself outside Mr. Clinton's shadow.</p>
