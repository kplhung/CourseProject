      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Performances by King Sunny Ade and his African Beats can be great arguments against the solo. In their long, semi-improvised orchestral suites, broken up with unison guitar riffs, harmonized vocal chanting, polyrhythms and grooves built to accentuate slow, waist-winding dances, the emphasis is on the collective, not the individual.</p>
        <p>And when Mr. Ade, who is from Nigeria, inserts a little surf-guitar lick, bending strings and putting a bit of Pop Art side by side with Yoruban culture, it is not meant to show his prowess; it's only a small detail on the big machine, with its maze of gears and pistons.</p>

        <p>Performances by King Sunny Ade and his African Beats can be great arguments against the solo. In their long, semi-improvised orchestral suites, broken up with unison guitar riffs, harmonized vocal chanting, polyrhythms and grooves built to accentuate slow, waist-winding dances, the emphasis is on the collective, not the individual.</p>
        <p>And when Mr. Ade, who is from Nigeria, inserts a little surf-guitar lick, bending strings and putting a bit of Pop Art side by side with Yoruban culture, it is not meant to show his prowess; it's only a small detail on the big machine, with its maze of gears and pistons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ade, who performed at S.O.B.'s last week, has appeared in New York semi-regularly over the last decade, though he does not have  the same hungry audience that he did in the early 80's when his reception here helped trigger the idea of world music.</p>
        <p>Back then, to fresh ears, Mr. Ade's juju music was a wild miscellany: it had echoes of old reggae in its lean guitar riffs, salsa in its Yoruban drum patterns, country in the steel-guitar playing, dub in the music's wide-open holes, folk and calypso in its gentle singing and the Grateful Dead and jazz in its long jams.</p>
        <p>Twenty years later Americans have more developed tastes for music outside their borders. Record-store racks and music aficionados have almost caught up to Mr. Ade's context. His work no longer seems so mysterious.</p>
        <p>But in an age when the great touring bands of dance music are dropping away, it remains astounding, a music of complex construction whose lightness keeps dancers from tiring too quickly.</p>
        <p>Bracketing the band on Thursday night, with its 13 instrumentalists and two backup singers, was a pedal-steel guitar on one side and two small talking drums on the other.  These were the instruments that broke out of the chattering rhythms and asserted themselves grandly, with Biodun Fatoke's steel guitar producing slightly sharp notes and the drummers squeezing the tension strings on the talking drums to pose bubbly, melodic questions and answers in the bass range. The talking drums took over much of the electric bassist's work, leaving the music's low end full of space; the best big bands, Mr. Ade's included, are always making secret subtractions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ade and his group sang mostly in Yoruba -- except for the refrain of a new song, ''Appreciation'' -- and spoke to the audience in English. ''Do you want to dance with me?'' Mr. Ade asked at one point. ''Or do you want me to show you how to dance? You're at the controls -- you have the authority of your ticket.''</p>
        <p>He answered his own question, and the band played a tense, teasing slow groove while he moved coolly, wiggling slowly to the floor and back up. While audience members came on stage to press money against Mr. Ade's perspiring neck and forehead, the electric guitars bumped the music along with concise, harmonized riffs.</p>
