        <p>In an attempt to curtail attacks against livery-cab drivers, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that a program to give donated emergency cellular phones to domestic violence victims would be extended to livery drivers.</p>
        <p>''This hopefully will offer some additional degree of protection and assistance to livery drivers who I know are very nervous about the situation,'' the mayor said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the mayor urged the drivers to obey the law that bars  them from picking up passengers who hail them off the streets as the most effective method to assure their safety. ''My advice to livery-cab drivers is you would be foolish to pick up street hails,'' he said. ''Please don't pick up street hails -- don't do it until we have a better handle on the situation.''</p>
        <p>The drivers, while encouraged by any effort to lend them some form of protection against attacks that have killed nine drivers since January, were skeptical that a telephone programmed to dial 911 would keep a murderer at bay. Fernando A. Mateo, the president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, said that in general, 911 calls involved too many complications to save the life of a driver being attacked. The operators ask several questions like the name and location of the driver and the type of car.</p>
        <p>''Any effort put forth is a good effort,'' Mr. Mateo said. ''But when you have someone in the car with a gun to your head, for you to dial 911 and be able to speak will be pretty tough. By the time the drivers finish answering all the questions they will be dead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mateo, attending the Bronx funeral of Manuel Lopez, who was shot dead in Brooklyn on Friday, also said the drivers were angered by what they saw as the light bail given to three teenage suspects over the weekend. Judge David Schmidt of Criminal Court in Brooklyn set bail at $100,000 each for Felicia Field, Charles Rhodes and Tyreek Cross, who were charged in the shooting of Mr. Lopez. The Brooklyn district attorney's office had asked for no bail.</p>
        <p>''We are a bit outraged right now because the judge who set the bail for these kids is totally out of hand,''  Mr. Mateo said. ''These drivers are furious about it. We may organize pickets or something against the judge.''</p>
        <p>The mayor and Howard Safir, the police commissioner, also attended the funeral in the Bronx after announcing the cell phone initiative.</p>
        <p>The idea of getting emergency cell phones to drivers stemmed from a city program begun in March that was initially scheduled to end on April 30. People were encouraged to donate their old cell phones, which would be programmed by Bell Atlantic to dial 911 immediately. Most were to be given to victims of domestic violence. The drive to collect phones from the public has been extended through May 15 to get as many as possible for livery cabs, too.</p>
        <p>Rhea Mallett, the executive director of the city's Commission to Combat Family Violence, said at a City Hall news conference that originally, the telephones were not due to be distributed until the summer. But she said 500 telephones would be available immediately to any taxi drivers who requested them.</p>
        <p>The fact that a mobile phone is not a foolproof safeguard against the murderous attacks was underscored by the fact that two of the nine drivers killed this year had cell phones with them. Mr. Safir said he thought installing partitions and picking up fares only via dispatchers would provide drivers with the most security.</p>
        <p>Livery cabs, unlike yellow medallion taxis, are banned by city regulations from picking up fares on the street, with their fares limited to passengers who call dispatchers. But because many livery cabs serve poor neighborhoods not visited by yellow cabs, many drivers routinely pick up street hails.</p>
