        <p>May Day Mass With the Pope  Pope John Paul II, pre-empting the trade unions' traditional hold on May 1, presided over a workers' rally that combined a solemn Catholic Mass with a raucous rock concert dedicated to third world debt relief. But the day was less about the Vatican or pop music than about the changes it showed taking place in Italy.</p>

        <p>Dispute on Red Cross Symbols  Concern is spreading among international relief organizations that the American Red Cross may be on the verge of withdrawing from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies because the umbrella organization has not agreed to admit an Israeli contingent under a Star of David flag.</p>

        <p>Philippines Hostages Examined  A doctor made the first visit to a group of 21 hostages held by armed rebels of the Islamic separatist group Abu Sayyaf. The hostages were suffering from hunger and diarrhea and some pleaded for water, as 50 to 70 rebels guarded the area. On a nearby island, another group of Abu Sayyaf rebels escaped with their 27 hostages when government troops overran their mountain base over the weekend, the military said.</p>

        <p>Turkey Leader Lacks Votes  Parliament failed for a second time to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to elect Ahmet Necdet Sezer, the reformist candidate for president favored by the leaders of all five parties, although Mr. Sezer finished far ahead of other candidates, with 314 votes. The next ballot is set for Friday; in that round, just a simple majority of 276 will be necessary.</p>

        <p>Some Big Corporations Are Forsaking Soft Money  Soft-money donations are on a pace to set a record, even though many big corporations have stopped making them because executives are disillusioned with the process and feel there are better ways to spend their companies' money and still stay politically involved. But other corporate interests, senior executives and unions are increasing their unrestricted gifts to political parties.</p>

        <p>Retiring 6.2% of National Debt  The government said it would pay off $216 billion of the $3.5 trillion national debt by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.

        <p>State Challenges U.S. Law In Bid for Cleaner Air  The Legislature gave final passage to a bill intended to reduce air pollution drifting into New York from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest and South. The measure would stop New York companies from keeping money they make by selling pollution credits, earned by cleaning their own smokestacks, to major polluters elsewhere. The action is the first by a state that directly challenges a major provision of the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990.</p>
