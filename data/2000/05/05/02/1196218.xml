      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Dawn Upshaw seems to think less about individual recital programs than about expansive celebrations of song that require several concerts and lead her listeners through a maze of styles and themes. As a soprano who is widely admired for the beauty of her voice, her perceptive and communicative interpretations and the inventiveness of her programming ideas, Ms. Upshaw has the clout and the drawing power to hold the stage for a series rather than an individual concert. She was thinking in series terms a dozen years ago when her career was at an earlier stage and before performer-driven series were as common as they have been at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall these last few seasons.</p>
        <p>Ms. Upshaw's current series, ''Images of Dawn,'' will make its way to exotic new music and American popular song before it ends on May 20. But its first installment, on Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully Hall, was a more conventional concert of French art song, with a slight thematic twist. Ms. Upshaw offered it as a tribute to Jane Bathori, a French mezzo-soprano who flourished in the early decades of the 20th century and gave the premieres of dozens of works, including the songs by Debussy, Ravel, Milhaud, Satie, Hahn, Honegger, Roussel, Tailleferre and Koechlin that Ms. Upshaw sang. The program largely replicated her recent Erato disc, ''Hommage a Jane Bathori, the Inspiring Muse,'' which she recorded in a Paris concert last year. Her superb accompanist on that recording, Jerome Ducros, was also her collaborator on Sunday.</p>

        <p>Dawn Upshaw seems to think less about individual recital programs than about expansive celebrations of song that require several concerts and lead her listeners through a maze of styles and themes. As a soprano who is widely admired for the beauty of her voice, her perceptive and communicative interpretations and the inventiveness of her programming ideas, Ms. Upshaw has the clout and the drawing power to hold the stage for a series rather than an individual concert. She was thinking in series terms a dozen years ago when her career was at an earlier stage and before performer-driven series were as common as they have been at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall these last few seasons.</p>
        <p>Ms. Upshaw's current series, ''Images of Dawn,'' will make its way to exotic new music and American popular song before it ends on May 20. But its first installment, on Sunday afternoon at Alice Tully Hall, was a more conventional concert of French art song, with a slight thematic twist. Ms. Upshaw offered it as a tribute to Jane Bathori, a French mezzo-soprano who flourished in the early decades of the 20th century and gave the premieres of dozens of works, including the songs by Debussy, Ravel, Milhaud, Satie, Hahn, Honegger, Roussel, Tailleferre and Koechlin that Ms. Upshaw sang. The program largely replicated her recent Erato disc, ''Hommage a Jane Bathori, the Inspiring Muse,'' which she recorded in a Paris concert last year. Her superb accompanist on that recording, Jerome Ducros, was also her collaborator on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Clearly Ms. Upshaw sees a kindred spirit here: like Bathori, she sings and commissions a good deal of new music, and perhaps at the back of her mind is the hope that a future soprano will recall her with equal generosity. The program, after all, could have stood on its merits without a unifying patron saint. And Ms. Upshaw is her own singer, not a re-creator of a past style.</p>
        <p>Her interpretive view of the French song repertory is admirably flexible, and although its overriding characteristic is an ear for chromatic nuance it also had a playful side. That may not suit all tastes: although her use of a slightly pinched ''child voice'' in Satie's ''Dapheneo'' and some of Hahn's settings of Robert Louis Stevenson poems was certainly supportable, given the texts, those readings veered uncomfortably toward preciousness.</p>
        <p>That said, the dramatic and sometimes theatrical flair that Ms. Upshaw brought to most of her readings had an enlivening effect, particularly in Honegger's evocative ''Clotilde,'' ''Automne'' and ''Les Choches'' from the six Apollinaire settings and Roussel's exquisitely emotional ''Adieux.'' Mr. Ducros matched Ms. Upshaw's fluid readings at every turn.</p>
