        <p>J. J. Pletcher remembers the young boy who got so angry when one of his father's horses lost a race that he would lie down in a stall and kick and cry. He remembers the young man so eager to become a trainer that as soon as graduation ceremonies were over at the University of Arizona, father and son drove overnight toward New York and Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>There, J. J. turned Todd Pletcher over to another horseman's son to put polish on the lessons begun on the dusty back sides of grits-and-hard-toast tracks in places like Bossier City, La., and Hot Springs, Ark.</p>
        <p>On Pletcher's first day, Jeff Lukas, dad D. Wayne's top assistant, handed him the lead of an expensive horse, one named Houston who had led the 1989 Kentucky Derby for a mile before fading to an eighth-place finish behind Sunday Silence.</p>
        <p>Don't let him get loose, Jeff Lukas told Pletcher. He held on to Houston with both hands then, and now, at 32, Pletcher has demonstrated he has retained every horse lesson ever imparted to him, from his days mucking stalls with his father to graduating from the Lukas finishing school in 1995 and starting his own stable.</p>
        <p>In a year where perhaps eight trainers will make their Kentucky Derby debut, Pletcher's bow is still extraordinary. He will saddle four starters, which in the 125 years of the race is a number matched by only James Rowe Sr. in 1923 and exceeded only once, by Lukas in 1996. Better is that all of his entries have proved on the oval that they belong.</p>
        <p>In Graeme Hall and Impeachment, he has the Arkansas Derby (Grade II) winner and third-place finisher. His colt Trippi captured the Flamingo (Grade III). And Pletcher's More Than Ready lost the Blue Grass (Grade I) by a head, has won 6 of his 10 races and has been in the money in all but one graded stakes race.</p>
        <p>''In April, I was hoping I might have More Than Ready in place to go, but then we got the big races from the other three, too, and it was clear they all earned their way into the race,'' Pletcher said. ''Sure we're fortunate, but the people in our program have worked hard to get here.''</p>
        <p>The influence of the Lukas program is evident in Pletcher's crisp presentation. His barns, whether here or at the home base for his 80 horses in New York, could pass for sidewalk cafes: manicured landscapes, silk saddlecloths and monogrammed blankets. The morning muckout of stalls resembles a swift, silent square dance; the grooms march into the cubicles as the hot walkers circle the horses outside.</p>
        <p>But Pletcher also displays a wry, salty streak inherited from his father, a Texan with a catalog of tales from his days crisscrossing quarter-horse and second-tier thoroughbred tracks across the South and Midwest.</p>
        <p>The father hoped college might keep his son away from the unpredictable milieu of the back side. ''I told him he was going to college and he was going to know what he wanted to study,'' said J. J. Pletcher, who won 370 races as a trainer, including the 1982 Oaklawn Handicap with Uncool. ''I helped him get summer jobs with Charlie Whittingham and Lukas. He also learned from my mistakes. I could never juice an owner into paying so much money for a horse. I wanted him to have the option to do something else.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, when his assistant trainer and primary exercise rider, Cindy Hutter, returned from an impressive workout aboard Trippi, who went six furlongs in 1:12.96, Pletcher sounded like his father in feigning being upset. ''I told Cindy I wanted him to go in 1:13,'' he said. ''Four one-hundredths off. I'll scold her later.''</p>
        <p>He is also perhaps more flexible than Lukas, as his handling of More Than Ready this year has demonstrated. As a 2-year-old, the smallish black colt ticked off five brilliant victories in a row at sprint distances, including the WHAS Stakes here on Derby day. But after spiking a fever that interrupted his late-summer training, More Than Ready finished third by a half-length in the Futurity at Belmont and followed it with a desultory fifth place in the Champagne.</p>
        <p>The colt was shipped to Lexington and what is the equivalent of the equine Mayo Clinic for extensive tests. Veterinarians found nothing wrong. So while many wrote off the colt as a precocious and perhaps broken-down sprinter, Pletcher and his owner, Jim Scatuorchio, did not.</p>
        <p>Instead, Pletcher prepared More Than Ready for the Derby with three races of increasing distances. The colt was a dead-heat winner in the seven-furlong Hutcheson, was passed in the final yards in the one-and-one-sixteenth-mile Louisiana Derby (Grade II) and, after showing he could rate behind horses, dueled through the stretch before losing to High Yield in the one-and-one-eighth-mile Blue Grass.</p>
        <p>''He's a detail guy, an incredibly hard worker,'' Scatuorchio said. ''But what has really been impressive is his ability to come up with a plan and his patience to stick to it. There were times I think both of us thought about walking him over to the Fountain of Youth or Florida Derby because he was doing so well. He wouldn't, and that's why we're here.''</p>
        <p>It paid off. Four of the horses who beat or tied him -- Bevo, Greenwood Lake, Mighty and Summer Note -- are injured and not here for the Derby. More Than Ready, on the other hand, is a dead-fit threat to wrestle the Derby away from the likely favorites, Fusaichi Pegasus, War Chant, The Deputy and High Yield.</p>
        <p>No matter what happens the first Saturday in May, Pletcher has grown out of the behavior that sent him to his father's horse stalls after a loss. Asked how much it might hurt his former boss if one of his four horses runs down Lukas's High Yield at the wire, he smiled.</p>
        <p>''About as much it hurt me when he got me in the Blue Grass,'' he said. ''And I'll take it.''</p>
