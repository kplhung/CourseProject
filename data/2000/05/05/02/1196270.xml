        <p>When the founders of Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc. finally agreed to sell their company last month, the Unilever executive credited with clinching the deal was Richard Goldstein, who heads the company's North American business.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the founders and Mr. Goldstein gathered in New York to discuss Ben &amp; Jerry's future -- distribution, new products, the role of the founders -- but it was a little awkward. And no wonder. Mr. Goldstein, who cultivated the relationship with Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, will not be around much longer.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, two weeks after the $326 million cash sale was approved by Ben &amp; Jerry's board, Mr. Goldstein said he was leaving Unilever to become chief executive of International Flavors and Fragrances. In other words, as he was persuading Ben &amp; Jerry's to join Unilever, Mr. Goldstein was himself a free agent.</p>
        <p>''I had spent time with him over the last five or six months, and I knew he might not be at Unilever forever,'' Mr. Greenfield said, calling the departure a loss to Unilever that left him ''personally really disappointed.'' He added, ''I didn't know he was considering something else at the time.''</p>
        <p>John Gould, a spokesman for Unilever, said Mr. Cohen and Mr. Greenfield had been assured by Unilever's co-chairman, Niall Fitzgerald, that Mr. Goldstein's departure would not affect the agreement.  ''While Dick was the one who happened to be involved in these discussions, the agreements are on behalf of the company, not any one individual,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenfield, who called Mr. Goldstein ''a person of extremely high integrity,'' confirmed that he had spoken to Mr. Fitzgerald. ''In that regard, I do feel good about it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The announcement was a sharp reminder of the surprises that come with being part of a consumer-products giant. Neither Mr. Cohen nor Mr. Greenfield expects it to be the last. In an interview yesterday at Unilever headquarters, Mr. Cohen said the transition would be complex.</p>
        <p>''What Ben &amp; Jerry's used to be is one of these smaller 'social values led' businesses,'' Mr. Cohen said, sitting at a conference table in the Unilever executive suite with Mr. Greenfield and Mr. Goldstein. ''What Ben &amp; Jerry's is in the process of becoming is an entity inside a larger business, trying to infuse those values in that larger business. We expect that it will be a long and winding road.''</p>
        <p>Both founders made plenty of money on the deal, which began Sept. 8 with a letter from Mr. Goldstein. Mr. Cohen owns more than 900,000 shares in the company, which are valued at $39.3 million under Unilever's offer of $43.60 a share. Mr. Greenfield, who had 220,000 shares, will receive $9.5 million.</p>
        <p>Each of the founders will be paid $200,000 a year to remain at the company, where they will continue as directors, according to the document outlining the terms of the deal.  Even though Mr. Goldstein is going to another company, he is taking a seat on the Ben &amp; Jerry's board, becoming the sole Unilever representative, according to Mr. Gould.</p>
        <p>The offering document also describes three shareholder lawsuits filed last month against Ben &amp; Jerry's and its board over an earlier plan to take the company private at a lower price of $38 a share. Unilever, Mr. Cohen and a venture capital group called Meadowbrook Lane Capital were part of that plan, which the board approved in late March. Ben &amp; Jerry's said the plan was ''never definitively approved'' and was dropped in the end, making the allegations unfounded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenfield said he was pleasantly surprised by his meeting last month with Mr. Fitzgerald.</p>
        <p>''I thought he was going to be nice to us but somewhat patronizing,'' Mr. Greenfield said. ''He wasn't that way at all.'' While Unilever has practical reasons for wanting to, say, preserve the oceans, the point ends up being similar to that championed by Ben &amp; Jerry's, he added. ''Ben and I come at it from a peace-and-justice point of view, that it's the right thing to do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In any case, the merger deal contains a provision in which Mr. Greenfield can sue Unilever, at Unilever's expense, for any breach of the terms in the deal, Mr. Goldstein said.</p>
        <p>''We don't have a problem with that,'' Mr. Goldstein added. His last day at Unilever will be May 31.</p>
