        <p>It was bad enough for NBC when its National Basketball Association ratings tumbled 21 percent during the regular season. But the playoffs were supposed to provide relief from the lingering effects of post-Jordan traumatic stress syndrome.</p>
        <p>There was false hope a week ago Sunday, when a tripleheader's overnight ratings rose 7 percent from a comparable threesome of games last year.</p>
        <p>But on Saturday, the overnight ratings slipped by 26 percent. Then they slid by 29 percent on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I expected a dip this weekend because last year, all three of our Saturday games were concluding Game 4's,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. ''One Sunday game was the Miami-Knicks game with the Allan Houston shot to win it. The other was the Sacramento-Utah overtime game.''</p>
        <p>Ebersol, the ever-sunny ratings dancer, refuses to panic over the Saturday-Sunday numbers. But the news was dismal. Five of NBC's six weekend games recorded lower ratings from the same time slots a year ago. The only game to avoid a comparison was the Knicks-Toronto Raptors game, which rated a 5.2, because there was no game last year in the 12:30 p.m. Eastern time slot.</p>
        <p>Saturday's Miami Heat-Detroit Pistons game produced the weekend's biggest decline, to a 3.3, down 32.6 percent.</p>
        <p>''The Miami-Detroit series is the one big disappointment,'' Ebersol said, because of injuries to the stars Grant Hill of Detroit and Tim Hardaway of Miami.</p>
        <p>The highest-rated game of the weekend, Sunday's Sacramento Kings' victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, produced a 7.2, down 23 percent from a 9.4 for a Sacramento-Utah Jazz contest.</p>
        <p>So far, NBC's 12 playoff games have rated an average 5.2, down 12 percent from a 5.9 for the 11 games played to date last year.</p>
        <p>Ebersol optimistically predicted that he would be pleased with an overall ratings decline of 6 percent to 7 percent through the conference finals. As usual, he can make falling ratings sound as good as a roaring Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>NBC's ratings do not rise or fall because of its studio show personnel. Still, viewers need a better analyst, one less conflicted than Isiah Thomas of ''NBA Showtime.''</p>
        <p>When Thomas acquired the Continental Basketball Association last August, he saw no reason to stop working for NBC, although he had just joined the business he covers.</p>
        <p>He saw no conflict in dispensing opinions for ''NBA Showtime,'' while owning a league he wants to turn into a minor league for the N.B.A. or a rival to one it may create.</p>
        <p>But smart viewers must ask, ''What is he not saying?'' He is no more proper as an N.B.A. commentator than Bill Gates would be as a technology analyst for CNBC.</p>
        <p>Now, Thomas is even more immersed in N.B.A. business by seeking coaching jobs around the league. Still, NBC's ardor for league royalty is unabated. ''He's disclosed his interest in coaching jobs, and I haven't seen him back off on criticism,'' Ebersol said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps no one on ''Showtime'' will ask Thomas to name the best candidate to succeed Lenny Wilkens as the Atlanta coach now that Thomas is a candidate. But an exchange on Sunday's ''Showtime'' underscored his conflict.</p>
        <p>Peter Vecsey, the show's reporter-analyst, said Thomas was talking to Atlanta, the Nets and Indiana about their coaching vacancies. Hannah Storm, the show's host, prodded him, but Thomas said only, ''I'm interested in coaching,'' and that he wanted to keep talks confidential.</p>
        <p>Thomas's evasiveness is fine if he is not paid for his commentary. But when the commentator turns into a newsmaker, it is time to step aside. Pat Buchanan has twice left CNN's ''Crossfire'' to make quixotic runs for the presidency.</p>
        <p>Perhaps if Thomas were terrific, one could argue that his views are too good to miss. But his insights are cautious and predictable, and his energy level verges on nonexistent.</p>
        <p>Vecsey makes the program hum with his provocative style and wit. When Storm asks questions, Thomas's muted answers are invariably trumped by the superior energy and information contained in Vecsey's.</p>
        <p>The playoff ratings of TNT and TBS, however, are rising, up about 5 percent through last Friday, to a 2.3 from a 2.2 last year.</p>
        <p>And the studio show offered on those two networks, by contrast, is almost always free-flowing fun. Its expansive new set, which includes a basketball court, offers the announcers room to move around, a refreshing change from NBC's claustrophobic look.</p>
        <p>The host Ernie Johnson Jr., playing a ringmaster's role, gets more free rein than Storm does. Kenny Smith's exuberant analysis -- sometimes too exuberant -- usually sparkles and is not dampened by a business agenda. Charles Barkley is, as expected, a quotation machine.</p>
        <p>The TNT/TBS show offers the cast generous time to interact. Smith and Barkley have an amusing chemistry, as do Johnson and Smith. Only Vecsey stirs chemical reactions -- and tempers -- on the NBC set.</p>
        <p>Derby Blackout?</p>
        <p>Local Time Warner Cable customers, and those in six other markets, may not see this weekend's Kentucky Derby and Stanley Cup coverage on ABC if an impasse between Time Warner and the Disney-owned network is not resolved. As of yesterday, Channel 7 was off the local Time Warner system, viewable only by those with DirecTV or antennas.</p>
        <p>The logical strategy would be for ABC to simulcast Saturday's Derby and Sunday's Stanley Cup games on ESPN, its Disney cousin.</p>
        <p>But Mark Mandel, an ABC Sports spokesman, said, ''We are not planning anything but what we've already scheduled.''</p>
