        <p>Out of Africa  Addressing issues like colonialism, nationalism, tribalism and gender in languages like Bambara, Wolof, Kaado, Criolo, Moore and French, 15 English-subtitled films from places like Mali, Cameroon and Zaire will be presented beginning at 7 tonight in ''The Ebony Screen: Films of Many Africas.'' On each Tuesday through June 13 a double or triple bill will be screened by Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street. The series opens with the 1998 Malian film ''La Vie sur Terre'' (''Life on Earth''), Abderrahmane Sissako's mixture of fiction and documentary about a filmmaker's return to his village to record its daily life. The 8 p.m. attraction, ''La Projection'' by Marie-Jaoul de Poncheville, shows what happened when ''Life on Earth'' was shown to the villagers.</p>
        <p>Role Models  What is the role of the private art patron in the development of public art collections? That question will be addressed beginning today in a two-part exhibition called ''The Collector as Patron in the 20th Century.'' The art is on view through July 31 at Knoedler &amp; Company, 19 East 70th Street, Manhattan. It includes works by, among others, Milton Avery, Romare Bearden, Helen Frankenthaler, Philip Guston, Jasper Johns and Ellsworth Kelly, many of them promised as gifts to museums by five prominent collector-patrons. Complementing these post-World War II and contemporary paintings is ''Profiles in Patronage.'' This archival component displays correspondence, photographs, newspaper clippings and other items that illuminate the public role of private collectors like Henry Clay Frick, Andrew and Paul Mellon, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Charles Lang Freer and Samuel H. Kress.</p>

        <p>Hello Again  Another grand old musical takes on new life when the City Center Encores! series presents the third and last production of its season. Opening on Thursday is the 1953 hit ''Wonderful Town,'' by Leonard Bernstein, Betty Comden and Adolph Green and directed by George Abbott. Donna Murphy stars in the latest version of the story of two sisters from Ohio who move to Greenwich Village to seek careers. Five performances are scheduled through Sunday.</p>
        <p>Setting Out  Biography, history, investigation, information, personal vision. These and more are embraced by the television documentary. Beginning tomorrow, the Museum of Television and Radio will hold its first Television Documentary Festival. Continuing through May 21, this noncompetitive event will feature outstanding documentaries produced for television in the United States within the last year, following each screening with a panel discussion involving the audience, filmmaker and production team. The festival also includes award winners, premieres, previews and a retrospective.</p>
