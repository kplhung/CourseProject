        <p>There have been so many blockbuster redevelopment projects in this gritty, resilient city in the past six years that a corner of Mayor Thomas Murphy's office is cluttered with ceremonial shovels that gleam with his dig-we-must determination.</p>
        <p>Still missing from that proud display, however, is the groundbreaker spade for one of the mayor's most controversial ideas: a plan to raze or gut 61 buildings and displace up to 125 businesses in one fell swoop through the tattered old retail core of downtown Pittsburgh. In their place, Mr. Murphy envisions an ambitious cluster of trendy restaurants, upscale national stores and underground parking for 1,000 cars to serve surrounding office towers and perchance lure affluent suburban shoppers back to their urban roots.</p>
        <p>It is such a sweeping plan that, even beyond the cries of outrage from longtime merchants still able to make a profit in Market Place, the area in question, Mayor Murphy has drawn no less an adversary than the National Trust for Historic Preservation, which calls the plan ''one of the most wrongheaded revitalization proposals to appear anywhere in this country in the last 30 years.''</p>
        <p>Such is the warning of Richard Moe, president of the trust, which is based in Washington and is the nation's largest private preservation organization. Mr. Moe calls the Pittsburgh plan a ''reversion to the worst of urban renewal in the 60's and 70's,'' when whole neighborhoods were swept away.</p>
        <p>''It's an anomaly,'' Mr. Moe said, describing how the national trend in most other cities is to selectively revitalize and showcase time-worn neighborhoods, rather than to replace them wholesale.</p>
        <p>From LoDo in Denver to South Beach in Miami, from the Lowerton district of St. Paul to the Seventh Street renewal in Washington, preservationists are citing dozens of less sweeping, more selective renovation programs across the country as profitable success stories that Pittsburgh would be wiser to emulate. But the mayor insists he needs something fast and singular, on the scale of the Copley Plaza renewal in Boston, to save downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>For all the opposition here and beyond, Mayor Murphy offers a smile of resolve and an encyclopedic accounting of the city's hard-earned recovery since the catastrophic collapse of its steel mill economy a generation ago. In $4 billion worth of current projects, he cites two new ballparks, a new convention center and hotels, office complexes offering 6,000 new jobs and a dozen other projects. The weary-looking Market Place stretch, he insists, is ''the hole in the doughnut'' that absolutely must be redone to make the urban whole palatable to investors.</p>
        <p>''In virtually everything we've done, from building ballparks to dealing with old industrial properties, we have faced enormous resistance,'' the mayor said, looking beyond his office shovels at a master-plan map vivid with splotches of large-scale change. ''Every one of these has been a struggle; it's the nature of changing.''</p>
        <p>To critics demanding a more tempered approach, Mr. Murphy, a 56-year-old son of a steelworker who rose from the nitty-gritty of civic politics to wield mayoral power, replies that the city has well employed the selective ''Main Street'' style of renewing building by building in other old neighborhoods. But the Market Place area, he insists, requires something more extensive and faster -- a single project of urban renewal that he wants completed in two to three years rather than 10.</p>
        <p>''The urgency we feel,'' the mayor emphasized, is rooted in the region's steady loss of residents for 30 years, with the city fighting to secure a more eclectic future as its population fades to 350,000, half its old blue-collar peak.</p>
        <p>Across the executive corridor, City Councilman Jim Ferlo exults no less in the city's resurgent pattern of fresh development. But he draws the line at the mayor's Market Place proposal, viewing it as ultimately more arrogant than ambitious.</p>
        <p>''Retailers there have been paying their tax bills for a hundred years, and suddenly they're blights on the city?'' said Mr. Ferlo, a Democrat like the mayor in this one-party city.</p>
        <p>The councilman complains that some of those very taxes would subsidize the arrival of national chains that would then enjoy a monopoly position in the $480-million redevelopment, which would cover about five acres radiating from Fifth and Forbes Avenues. Mayor Murphy says the plan would involve $53 million in city subsidies, but opponents estimate it would be twice that.</p>
        <p>Like most other opponents, Mr. Ferlo agrees that a stylish but far more measured upgrading is badly needed in the area. It now presents a tired mix of seedy novelty shops and respected longtime merchants like the 130-year-old Original Oyster House, one of several establishments that would be exempted from removal under the mayor's plan.</p>
        <p>But Gabriel's shoe repair around the corner would have to go, as would other humbler shops revered by neighborhood regulars like Bernie Lynch, a volunteer leader of the fight against Mr. Murphy's plan.</p>
        <p>''They'd destroy a real historic district to build a pretend historic district,'' said Ms. Lynch, strolling the neighborhood and savoring her first-name familiarity with merchants.</p>
        <p>''The mayor is offering a leasing agent's dream and a city's nightmare,'' she said, adding that the Institute for Justice in Washington was already preparing a lawsuit for the local owners who would be displaced by national competitors.</p>
        <p>The mayor denies Ms. Lynch's contention that the project would be a thinly disguised mall. He said the neighborhood's three-story scale would be retained, and up to 20 existing building facades. But opponents say the character of one of the city's oldest neighborhoods would be lost.</p>
        <p>The opposition, coalescing as the Golden Triangle Community Development Corporation, has offered a $256 million counterproposal to rehabilitate facades and modernize the area's dilapidated upper floors for business and housing. Mayor Murphy, trying to finesse the five votes he needs on the nine-member City Council, recently added some housing to his plan.</p>
        <p>The outcome remains uncertain, with the proposal not yet formally submitted and some Council members underlining the failure of an earlier mayoral initiative, the construction of a Lazarus department store two years ago. It was built downtown with $48 million in public subsidies and a guarantee to pay no city rent until it reaches $41 million in annual sales, a level it has thus far failed to approach.</p>
        <p>Down at ground zero, Patty Maloney, a local card store merchant on Wood Street, offered hearty laughter at the mayor's promise to help relocate the scores of displaced retailers to within a 10-minute walk of Market Place. As president of the Golden Triangle association, Ms. Maloney said she had found only 30 open retail spots for all the displaced, none comparable to what she had now.</p>
        <p>''The thing is we own this building, picked the location, took the risk and built this business up -- we did everything we were supposed to do,'' she said, asking how a conglomerate of upscale newcomers given a monopoly franchise could match that investment in the city and its people.</p>
        <p>''The chains can't do the things local businesses can do in the neighborhood,'' Ms. Maloney asserted, denying the mayor's complaint that merchants have let the area drift downward for decades.</p>
        <p>''Young people aren't leaving this city because there's no Banana Republic, no Pottery Barn downtown,'' Ms. Maloney argued, emphasizing the need for high-tech jobs that she said could be invited by creating office space above existing shops.</p>
        <p>But it is this very need for jobs that Mayor Murphy insists can only be solved by the image of a fresh Pittsburgh renewed at its very heart.</p>
        <p>''We have to create a scale of development that changes the dynamic of downtown,'' he said, warning against the alternative of incremental change. ''We need to move more quickly,'' he added, at once treasuring and regretting what he described as the city's small-town resistance to change.</p>
        <p>''There's an old joke we have about ourselves in Pittsburgh,'' the mayor said. ''It goes: If the world ends, you want to be living in Pittsburgh because you'll have 10 more years to live.''</p>
