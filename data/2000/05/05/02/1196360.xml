        <p>It was the kind of inning the Mets fear with Bill Pulsipher, the kind in which the left-hander allows little problems to morph into bigger ones.</p>
        <p>Pulsipher was making his season debut with the Mets tonight, joining the rotation until Bobby J. Jones can come back from a calf strain. One reason the Mets promoted Pulsipher, their former top prospect, was that he had shown better concentration in his starts at Class AAA Norfolk; he could recover from adversity.</p>
        <p>But the San Francisco Giants beat Pulsipher last night, 10-3, at the new Pacific Bell Park, and they did not have to try too hard. Trailing by 1-0 in the fourth inning, Pulsipher walked the Giants' third and fourth hitters, Barry Bonds and Jeff Kent. After a sacrifice bunt and a run-scoring single, Pulsipher hit J. T. Snow to load the bases.</p>
        <p>Bobby Estalella then singled in two runs, and as Pulsipher returned to the mound after backing up the plate, catcher Todd Pratt patted him, offering encouragement. Pulsipher stalked ahead, without acknowledging it. The Giants starter Shawn Estes squared to bunt, but Pulsipher walked him on four pitches, all of which missed the strike zone badly.</p>
        <p>That was it for Pulsipher, who allowed four runs on three hits and four walks in three and one-third innings. He was making just his second start for the Mets since 1995, a promising season that ended when elbow problems shut him down. That was ominous for Pulsipher, who was then 21 years old. He would miss most of the next two seasons while attempting to come back from elbow surgery. He made just one start for the Mets in 1998 before they traded him to Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Pulsipher's counterpart, Estes, allowed two earned runs in seven innings to beat the Mets for the fifth time in seven decisions. But a impressive as he was, Giants fans will remember the game for something else.</p>
        <p>Facing Rich Rodriguez in the sixth inning, the Giants star Barry Bonds lofted a towering fly that landed in San Francisco Bay, 418 feet from home plate. It was the first ball hit into the water outside Pacific Bell Park, and it touched off a celebration among the 40,930 fans, who stood and screamed until Bonds popped from the dugout, waving his arms to acknowledge the cheers.</p>
        <p>Joseph Figone, a groundskeeper at the Giants' former home, the blustery 3Com Park, was the luckiest fan of all. Powering a dinghy decorated with a Giants flag, Figone outraced a motorboat to the ball, swooping the prize with a net as the boats bumped together. Later, Figone raised a bottle of champagne, toasting his fortune.</p>
        <p>That homer put the Giants up by 9-0, but the Mets had managed some celebrating of their own before the game unraveled.</p>
        <p>With two outs in the third inning, center fielder Jay Payton raced to his right in pursuit of a deep fly by Bill Mueller. In front of the 382-foot sign in the left-center-field gap, Payton leaped and stretched his glove just above that of a fan, his shoulder crashing into the padded wall and he made the catch. Payton then grabbed the ball with his right hand, holding it aloft in excitement as he jogged from the warning track.</p>
        <p>The Mets were playing the game with only one healthy catcher; to make room for Pulsipher, they had optioned reserve catcher Vance Wilson to Class AAA Norfolk. Mike Piazza, who hyperextended his right elbow in a home plate collision on Friday, was still feeling discomfort today and was planning to begin throwing again on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The Mets had emergency options -- Matt Franco, Melvin Mora, Jon Nunnally and Todd Zeile -- and for a moment it seemed they would need one. With the bases loaded in the fourth, first baseman Zeile fielded a grounder and fired it home to catcher Pratt, who was touching home plate with his right foot for the force.</p>
        <p>Snow, trying to score from third, slid hard into Pratt's knees, knocking him off his feet for a hard landing on his backside. Pratt got up and motioned toward Snow, barking at him, and the umpire Mark Wegner quickly came between the players as both benches emptied.</p>
        <p>But no punches were thrown and Pratt limped away from the fray. He was examined by a trainer and stayed in, inviting heavy booing from a crowd that has reason to be enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>There is a vitality to games at Pacific Bell Park and these are heady days for the Giants, whose public-financing proposals were defeated by voters four times from 1987-92.</p>
        <p>To build the new park, they needed $15 million from taxpayers to improve the surrounding area and raised $330 million for the stadium through loans, corporate sponsorships and personal-seat licenses.</p>
        <p>''We had a lot of critics when we started this effort four or five years ago,'' said the Giants president Peter Magowan. ''They said it couldn't be done, we would never be able to finance it, and even if we do, San Francisco is not a baseball town. Now, people are saying, 'Well, maybe we were wrong.' ''</p>
