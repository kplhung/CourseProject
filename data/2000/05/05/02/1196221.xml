        <p>She muscled her way into the neighborhood in the 1920's, when nobody thought she belonged there. Now here she is again, trying to squeeze in uptown with those ample hips of hers, looking for a spot among the witty Brits and singing animals and dancing gymnasts. And isn't she a sight for glazed eyes? Stand up,  boys, and take your hats off. Mae West is back on Broadway.</p>
        <p>Miss West has returned in a compact Rolls-Royce of a vehicle called ''Dirty Blonde,'' the play written by and starring Claudia Shear that opened last night at the Helen Hayes Theater. Eight decades after a work of theater with the forthright title of ''Sex'' landed her in jail and 20-some years after her death, West is proving that she still has the power to shake things up. She has also, not incidentally, provided the inspiration for what is hands down the best new American play of the season.</p>
        <p>Though West is the dominant presence in ''Dirty Blonde,'' which was first seen off Broadway at the New York Theater Workshop, this is no evening of mere impersonation. It's not ''Mae West Tonight!,'' with a celebrity facsimile spouting choice epigrams. Nor is it a high-toned tabloid of a play in which a real-life sacred monster reveals her all-too-human heart, a la Maria Callas in Terrence McNally's ''Master Class.''</p>
        <p>No, Ms. Shear's ''Dirty Blonde'' is a multilayered study of the nature of stardom, as experienced by one of its avatars and two adoring fans. Shaped with remarkable fluidity and inventiveness, ''Dirty Blonde'' presents one of the canniest portraits on record of that floating dialogue between icons and idolizers that remains so much a part of American culture. What's more, it does so without the usual tut-tutting, instead making a persuasive case for star worship as a healthy religion.</p>
        <p>Conceived by Ms. Shear and the show's director, James Lapine, who does his best work in years here, ''Dirty Blonde'' frames West's self-willed rise to glory through the perspective of two contemporary admirers who meet at the actress's grave in Queens. They are Jo (Ms. Shear), a sometime actress and full-time loudmouth, and Charlie (Kevin Chamberlin), a big, self-effacing fellow who works in the movie archives of the public library.</p>
        <p>A less imaginative play would begin with this graveside encounter. ''Dirty Blonde'' starts by bringing Jo and Charlie to the edges of opposite sides of the stage, where they take turns delivering a sort of litany that describes the traits of the archetypal ''tough girl.'' She is someone who, as Charlie says, ''goes where she shouldn't, and when she gets there, she does exactly what she wants . . . and she likes it.''</p>
        <p>That's the official version of Mae West, of course, and like most outsize public icons, it is made of natural grit and artificial varnish. ''Dirty Blonde'' will proceed to deconstruct that persona, as it shifts between two essential story lines: the professional evolution of Mae (who is embodied, brilliantly, in all phases of her adult life by Ms. Shear) and the developing relationship between Jo and Charlie.</p>
        <p>The Jo and Charlie plot, one of the more unlikely love stories of the season, is pretty much chronological. The story of Mae leapfrogs in time, showing her at one instant as a pushy young hopeful in vaudeville and the next as the stylized gargoyle of her old age, with Mr. Chamberlin and the invaluable Bob Stillman (also the show's musical director) portraying human stepping stones and resting places along Mae's path to legendhood.</p>
        <p>''Dirty Blonde'' is especially ingenious in tracing the elements that West appropriated in creating herself. The pelvic dancing she observed in Harlem nightclubs, the baroquely exaggerated femininity of female impersonators, the opulent hourglass glamor of the gaslight era -- the discovery of these elements is rendered with an immediate freshness.</p>
        <p>So, however, is the gnarled caricature of a woman whom Charlie remembers meeting as a young man (the occasion for the evening's most memorable sequences) and who is seen performing an arthritic nightclub routine in Las Vegas, held up by two musclemen. Both as playwright and performer, Ms. Shear finds the continuity in all the seasons of Mae, the unrelenting drive that shapes and finally warps.</p>
        <p>The play gives credence to the observation made by Arthur Laurents in his recently published memoir that ''anyone who becomes a movie star must be superhuman to remain human.'' Yet while the geriatric Mae is indeed monstrous, ''Dirty Blonde'' refrains from lip-smacking schadenfreude.</p>
        <p>Rather, it views the transformation with a compassion commonly reserved for more obviously noble sacrifices. The play has its own perverse but credible theology: Mae becomes a monster that others might draw what they need from the courageous, defiant and exaggerated symbol she became. (Not, of course, that this was her intention.) The idea of Mae West helps Charlie and Jo, who both define themselves as losers, get through the day. It is also what brings and keeps them together.</p>
        <p>Since it was seen downtown last winter, ''Dirty Blonde'' has changed only for the better. The script remains basically the same, with a little tightening here and there. But Mr. Lapine's adroit staging feels even more streamlined now and more sure-footed. In their Jo and Charlie incarnations, Ms. Shear and the wonderful Mr. Chamberlin, who knows that low-key doesn't have to mean invisible, have found a newly magnetic sense of mutual attraction that justifies the play's ending.</p>
        <p>What's more surprising is how effortlessly the play seems to fill the Helen Hayes, a 1912 jewel box for the rough diamond that was Mae West. Douglas Stein's inspired warm pink trapezoid of a set; Susan Hilferty's time-traveling costumes and David Lander's cinematic lighting work beautifully together to create a world in which past and present bleed into each other.</p>
        <p>It's a sensibility that reaches epiphanal heights in a scene in which both Mae and Jo turn into the creature who would forever after be identified as Mae West. The moment is one that could be achieved only in the theater, and while ''Dirty Blonde'' may celebrate a movie star, it also celebrates theater.</p>
        <p>The show does indeed incorporate many of fabled West witticisms. Yet Ms. Shear's words are on their own terms equally resonant, blending a novelist's sense of detail with a dramatist's feel for music.</p>
        <p>Listen, for example, to Charlie, describing the elderly Mae settling into a car: ''I could see her sink against the seat, staring straight ahead, like a doll on a pillow.'' Or here is Jo on the virtues of Mae as a role model: ''No desperation, no pain behind the eyes, 'the man who got away,' 'I love him so, he beats me too' or any of that . . . She's my teenage fantasy, my mother's revenge.''</p>
        <p>That's still what comes across when you see Mae West in her movies: a pure sexual confidence untainted by guilt or doubt. American sex objects before and after her were nearly always conflicted and usually self-destructive.</p>
        <p>Of course she shocked and delighted the audiences of her heyday. Who else was like that? Who, for that matter, is like that now? Ms. Shear finds the enduring substance in the smoke and mirrors of one actress's stardom, allowing Mae West to shock and delight once again.</p>
