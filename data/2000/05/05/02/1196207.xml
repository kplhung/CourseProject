        <p>Long after the courts untangle Elian Gonzalez's future, mental health professionals may still be pondering the meaning of their own involvement in the Cuban boy's American odyssey.</p>
        <p>Psychiatrists and psychologists have taken an active, and often very public, part in the unfolding drama, advising government officials, voicing their opinions on talk shows and in news accounts, escorting Elian on his flight to Washington and even, in one case, assisting Diane Sawyer in her interview with the 6-year-old on ''Good Morning America.''</p>
        <p>Many in the field are happy that their oft-maligned profession is receiving serious notice. And they note that the experts helped government officials make informed decisions and provided context for a public riveted by Elian's plight.</p>
        <p>Yet the pressures of intense publicity and political interest, others feel, at times led experts into uncharted and risky territory.</p>
        <p>In most cases, the professionals directly involved were not acting as Elian's doctors, bound by strict confidentiality requirements, but as ''examiners'' or ''consultants'' hired by third parties, a role similar to that of experts who testify in court.</p>
        <p>Such functions, said Dr. Thomas Gutheil, an expert in psychiatry and law at Harvard University Medical School, are governed by different, often broader, ethical and clinical considerations.</p>
        <p>A medical escort, for example, like the government psychiatrist who accompanied Elian on the airplane, is acting ''as a simple observer, and is not incorporating a treatment relationship,'' Dr. Gutheil said.</p>
        <p>Yet other mental health professionals argue that the public is not always able to make such distinctions. And they worry that the public discussion of Elian's case, while it may have fallen within ethical bounds, may ultimately harm their profession.</p>
        <p>The presence of Dr. Gunther Perdigao, a child psychoanalyst who speaks Spanish, during the ''Good Morning America'' interview, for instance, has stirred some controversy within the American Psychoanalytic Association, which, at ABC's behest, recommended Dr. Perdigao for the job.</p>
        <p>Dr. Perdigao said his role was to make sure Ms. Sawyer ''wasn't doing anything that would be hurtful or damaging to the child.'' He offered advice on how to talk to Elian, translated and suggested the drawing exercise in which Elian drew pictures of his boat trip from Cuba.</p>
        <p>''This was not a child therapy session,'' Dr. Perdigao said.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Robert Galatzer-Levy, a psychoanalyst in Chicago, said that he was not sure the public could tell the difference and that the analyst's presence might have lent authority to an interview some criticized as exploitative.</p>
        <p>''The concern was that it is of the greatest importance that people, when they are talking to a mental health professional, know that their communications are confidential,'' Dr. Galatzer-Levy said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Leon Hoffman, chairman of the psychoanalytic association's public information committee, said members would discuss the decision to provide an expert for the program at meetings later this month.</p>
        <p>Public statements about Elian's situation by professionals who had not interviewed him personally, including the team of experts engaged by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, also raise difficult questions, some observers feel.</p>
        <p>''It's certainly legitimate for the government to seek expert advice in complex situations,'' said Dr. Paul S. Applebaum, chairman of psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester.</p>
        <p>''But it's not clear to me,'' Dr. Applebaum said, ''that there is any substantial benefit to sharing those conclusions with the public, and there may be harm -- harm to child and harm to the integrity of the mental health profession, resulting in the false impression that most professionals are so quick to draw conclusions they are willing to do so even if they haven't laid eyes on the person.''</p>
        <p>He pointed out that the American Psychiatric Association discourages psychiatrists from speaking publicly about cases involving people they have not evaluated.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Irwin Redlener, the pediatrician who organized the team of mental health experts for the I.N.S., said that given what was at stake for Elian, the fact that the consultants were acting as government representatives and the extraordinary public scrutiny of the case, the public comments made by the professionals were appropriate.</p>
        <p>''They were trying to be very, very careful about the words they used,'' he said. ''And the opinions were critically germane at virtually every step of the process.''</p>
        <p>Still, he added, many aspects of professionals' participation in the case could benefit from some ''really thoughtful analysis.''</p>
        <p>''This was so far outside the norm,'' Dr. Redlener said. ''There was a kind of tacit approval by society to allow this unbelievable exposure of what should have been a private matter.</p>
