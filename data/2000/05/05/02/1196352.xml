        <p>Following Coach Larry Robinson's instructions almost to perfection, the Devils gained the upper hand tonight in their Eastern Conference semifinal series with a 5-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>
        <p>Starting with the goaltending of Martin Brodeur, the Devils did everything so well upon returning home after splitting the first two games in Toronto that they had the crowd of 18,524 at Continental Arena chanting ''Sixty-seven, sixty-seven,'' in mock reference to 1967, the last time the Leafs won the Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>After a wide-open first period, the Devils tightened the defense, created traffic in front of goaltender Curtis Joseph and scored five goals.</p>
        <p>Five different Devils players scored. The Maple Leafs did not get their goal until after the Devils had completed their scoring. Toronto's goal, by Kevyn Adams, came with 4 minutes 17 seconds to play. Brodeur stopped the other 22 Maple Leafs shots; the Devils had 36 shots on Joseph.</p>
        <p>One of the main reasons the Maple Leafs are down by 2-1 in this four-of-seven-game series that resumes here Wednesday night is the lack of production by the top line of Mats Sundin, Jonas Hoglund and Steve Thomas.</p>
        <p>The line produced 20 points in the first round to eliminate Ottawa. It has produced nothing against the Devils.</p>
        <p>While Toronto's premier line failed, the Devils' top line of Jason Arnott, Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora came alive with each player scoring a goal. The other goals came from Scott Gomez and Alexander Mogilny.</p>
        <p>Elias, who had 35 goals in the regular season, also had two assists. But it was his short-handed goal on a backhand shot that was the talk of the night, and left the Leafs talking to themselves as they fell behind by 3-0 shortly before the second intermission.</p>
        <p>''One of the things we did well was put our chances in,'' Robinson said. ''I said from the beginning that special teams make a difference in the playoffs and tonight we got power-play goals and a short-handed goal.''</p>
        <p>Arnott and Mogilny scored on the power play; Elias's unassisted goal came while the Devils were short-handed.</p>
        <p>With 2:27 left in the second period,  Elias intercepted a clearing pass and skated down the right wing, eluding a Toronto defender before he faked Joseph to his knees. He went around the net from right to left and beat Joseph with a backhander.</p>
        <p>It was the second playoff goal for Elias.</p>
        <p>''We got frustrated after we didn't score in the first period and after that short-handed goal,'' said Coach Pat Quinn of the Maple Leafs. ''We didn't compete after we went down by three goals.''</p>
        <p>Robinson and Quinn were unhappy with the way things unfolded in the first period, when Brodeur and Joseph were at their best.</p>
        <p>But while the Devils were raving about Brodeur's performance afterward, Quinn put some blame on Joseph for the second-period goal by Gomez, which put the Devils up by 2-0.</p>
        <p>Gomez's goal was all his own work. He started the sequence by winning a face-off from Adams, gained control of the puck as Adams fell down in the right circle, cut into the middle and then beat Joseph with a shot under the glove with 4:57 left in the second period.</p>
        <p>Gomez, the league's top-scoring rookie in the regular season, got the least amount of ice time among New Jersey forwards in the first two periods, but he made an impact near the end of the second period, when he scored his second playoff goal.</p>
        <p>When asked about the prospect of being benched, Gomez said, ''We're 6-1 in the playoffs and I don't think you try to fix something that's not broken.''</p>
        <p>For the Maple Leafs, it was the ninth time in their nine playoff games this spring that they failed to score in the opening period.</p>
        <p>Joseph's biggest saves in the session came 12 minutes into the period, , when he thwarted Holik, Randy McKay and Steve Kelly even though he lost his stick.</p>
        <p>Brodeur's best moments in the opening period came in the 10th minute and 17th minutes. First, he denied Igor Korolev after Devils defenseman Colin White mishandled the puck at the blue line.</p>
        <p>Korolev showed plenty of patience as he stood poised to shoot from the left of Brodeur, but Brodeur was even more patient, denying Korolev's shot and the rebound.</p>
        <p>Seven minutes later, the crowd, again short of a sellout, gave Brodeur a standing ovation when he stopped Dmitri Khristich's shot and then blocked a rebound shot by sprawling in the crease.</p>
        <p>''We started slow, but we played great defensively after that,'' Brodeur said. ''We kept going to the net and got some breaks.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The Devils went with the same lineup for the fifth consecutive game, or since the third game of the sweep of Florida in the first round. . . . With three goals in the second period, the Devils surpassed the total goals scored by either team in the first two games of the series.</p>
