        <p>In the surreal instant that Tim Hardaway's blind fling at the basket dropped through the net on April 9 in Miami, the Heat players spun, leaped and threw up their arms as if they were children hearing the last school bell of the year.</p>
        <p>But it was a buzzer, not a bell. And it was the regular season, not a title. It merely seemed like something much bigger because of the Heat's response to its dramatic overtime victory against its nemesis, the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''The pieces of the puzzle are all falling into place,'' Alonzo Mourning said that evening.</p>
        <p>''About time something went right for us against them,'' Hardaway said.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's a coincidence that there were 4.7 seconds on the clock; that's about the same amount of time when Allan Houston bounced his in last year -- ironic,'' said Coach Pat Riley, drawing a comparison to Miami's interrupted playoff run a year ago.</p>
        <p>In the background of the Heat's jubilation, some of the Knicks smirked inwardly. One Knick said privately, ''You think they'd really won something.''</p>
        <p>Only one game of 82. Only a Heat team finishing off a season series with a 3-1 edge against the Knicks. But as the Knicks proved with the completion of a three-game sweep of Toronto over the weekend, the regular season does not set a precedent for the playoffs. The Raptors had a 3-1 edge, too, in the regular season, but it was the Knicks who advanced.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, in the sun-baked city that has become their second home, the Knicks will open their four-of-seven-game, second-round playoff series against -- who else? -- the Heat, at American Airlines Arena.</p>
        <p>''Everyone said that Toronto beat us up in the regular season,'' Patrick Ewing said after the Knicks eliminated the Raptors in Game 3 on Sunday. ''They'll be saying that same thing again.''</p>
        <p>Actually, few people bought into Coach Jeff Van Gundy's artful attempt to cast his playoff-tested Knicks as the desperate underdogs against a Raptor team led by a neophyte star like Vince Carter. While the Heat is battle tested, the team seems a bit spooked by its New York rivals, who have eliminated Miami on its home floor two years in a row. Along with Miami's frustration, there has been palpable contempt for the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''I hate them with all the hate that you can hate with,'' Hardaway once said. ''Can you hate more than that? If you can, I hate them more than that.''</p>
        <p>Sound bites like these merely amuse the Knicks. While they respect the Heat, they lick their lips and rub their hands together at the thought of eliminating Miami once again.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking forward to this challenge,'' Larry Johnson said. ''It's an up note for us, nothing but happy feelings around here.''</p>
        <p>The regular season does not even register in the Knicks' minds. It does not matter if they shot only 42.1 percent against the Heat in their four games, or if Mourning mauled them for 33 points on April 9. It does not matter if Latrell Sprewell shot only 37.7 percent in the shadow of Jamal Mashburn this season, or if Chris Childs hit only 22.7 percent of his shots against Hardaway. It does not matter if the Knicks lost three games by a total of 16 points, or won one of them at Madison Square Garden by an impressive score of 94-80.</p>
        <p>''We had them at their place when Tim hit that miracle shot,'' Marcus Camby said. ''We're confident we can beat them there, on their floor. We didn't play well against them in the regular season, but this is the playoffs. People said we couldn't get it done in Toronto because they handled us in the regular season, but it didn't end up that way at all. We went there and took care of business.''</p>
        <p>With time to dissect the Raptors, Van Gundy came up with the right double-team plan -- which was implemented by a focused Sprewell -- and the Knicks took the ball out of Carter's hands. With no sure-fire teammates around Carter to deliver, the scheme worked. Now, Van Gundy has five days ahead of him to prepare his team. Has he fallen in love with the once forbidden double team? Probably not.</p>
        <p>The Heat is an entirely different team than the Raptors. As Childs put it, ''We look at them and we're looking into the mirror.'' If anything, Van Gundy will have to purge the Knicks of any false confidence coming off their series with Toronto.</p>
        <p>''It's back to work,'' Sprewell said. ''We have to be ready.''</p>
        <p>The Heat players are steeling themselves as well. It may have seemed like a turning point against a rival at the time, but April 9 is forever ago. And the regular season is long gone, too. Even the Heat realizes that now. Since Hardaway's wild shot sent the team into an uncharacteristic frenzy, the players have come down to earth.</p>
        <p>''These are two evenly matched teams,'' Heat forward P. J. Brown said yesterday after practice in Miami. ''It's a flip-of-the-coin type of thing. It comes down to who plays the hardest, like the last game played against them. It came down to who was more desperate.</p>
        <p>''That wasn't a playoff situation, but it definitely felt good to get those guys. I see the highlights of the ending, and say, 'Wow, what a wild shot.' It helped us, but the regular season doesn't matter. We all thought Toronto-New York was going to be a better series, but look what happened.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Knicks did not practice on Monday and will begin their weeklong preparation Tuesday at SUNY-Purchase. . . . MARCUS CAMBY had the flu for Game 3 in Toronto, but he did not expect to miss practice Tuesday.</p>
