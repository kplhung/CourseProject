        <p>Live girls! Live girls! Live girls are back at Show World!</p>
        <p>The barker got right to the point, and, as he tells it, he made sure that his siren song was heard through the red and black, low-ceilinged rooms of the Times Square sex emporium.</p>
        <p>Veteran employees stuck their heads in the Go-Go Bar, grinning hopefully. Curious video booth customers left ''A Week in the Life of Kristi Myst'' and ''The Best of Raylene'' to investigate. Live girls. Live girls? Live girls!</p>
        <p>But then, in the interest of full disclosure, someone would have to explain: these girls were members of a theater company. They were going to perform Shakespeare. With their clothes on.</p>
        <p>Oh.</p>
        <p>In a city where enforced morality and rents are both on the rise, it amounts to a meeting of endangered minds: sex entertainment and fringe theater.</p>
        <p>In an effort to dodge the city's efforts to rid Times Square of sex entertainment establishments, Show World Center, which burlesque historians say was once a widely imitated model for the industry, has undergone a gradual but thorough transformation, giving over a vast tract of mirror-tiled, runway-lighted acreage to theater productions that are Off Off, but not so far from, Broadway.</p>
        <p>While Show World, which opened on Eighth Avenue in 1975, still has banks of video peep show booths and an adults-only sex shop that is as brightly lighted as a surgery room, more than 80 percent of the floor space in the multilevel complex has been de-porned.</p>
        <p>In the former Big Top Lounge, which once housed carousel horses ridden by topless dancers, two downtown theater companies are running an ''Urban Fairytale Festival'' of short plays. In the Go-Go Bar, on a stage still graced by a golden pole, one can now see Chekhov's ''Vaudevilles.''</p>
        <p>Show World first dipped a toe into the theater business as a landlord. In 1997, it leased the former Triple Treat Theater to three actors who started Pantheon Productions. That theater uses a separate entrance around the corner on 42nd Street.</p>
        <p>But Show World's current theatrical enterprise has its roots in zoning regulations for sex shops and strip clubs that took effect in 1998. The regulations, which would have forced Show World to close, apply to any business that devotes more than 40 percent of its space to sexual entertainment or merchandise.</p>
        <p>To comply, Show World got rid of its topless dancers and peep show ''booth babies'' and began looking for other uses for its space. Soon, independent filmmakers were showing short films every weekend, and an Off Off Broadway theater company, Collapsible Giraffe, was presenting a play called ''Three Virgins.''</p>
        <p>In July 1999, Aaron Beall, the artistic director of Todo Con Nada, a Lower East Side theater company and presenting organization, came looking for a venue for a theater festival. Show World asked him to become artistic director of a joint venture now called Nada Show World. The theater companies do not pay rent, but Show World shares in proceeds from ticket sales.</p>
        <p>He could do anything he wanted, Mr. Beall said he was told by Show World's management. Only, please: no nudity. The risk for a business still fighting in court to stay open was too great. That meant that what Mr. Beall might be able to pull off downtown would not fly here.</p>
        <p>''Show World,'' Mr. Beall said, ''is our chaste space.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Beall, the promise of an affordable space was enough to lure him almost anywhere. In its two other spaces on Ludlow Street, Todo Con Nada, like many performing troupes, struggles to pay rent. But Show World was more than a cheap option of last resort. There was also the sleaze factor.</p>
        <p>''It's a great environment for the creation of art,'' Mr. Beall said. Instead of trying to steer clear of pornographic taint, the companies that perform at Nada Show World revel in the atmosphere of the demimonde, using it as a draw for curious audience members.</p>
        <p>It has even been an artistic inspiration: the schedule has included ''God of Vengeance,'' a play about a Jewish brothel whose owner tries to keep his daughter pure; ''Perviverse,'' a ''sweet-tempered comedy,'' according to Mr. Beall, about the London fetish subculture; and perhaps most significant, ''The Show World Reunion Show,'' a takeoff on Shakespeare's ''Measure for Measure'' performed as if by Show World's disc jockeys, dancers and customers of yore.</p>
        <p>The show was performed in a workshop in mid-March, and will reopen for a full run this fall.</p>
        <p>Its creators, Diane Paulus and Randy Weiner of Project 400, a theater company best known for its disco-era spin on ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' saw ''The Show World Reunion Show'' as a chance to expand their audience.</p>
        <p>''We thought, God, if we can just get the people that want to see live girls, and then get the Shakespeare buffs, we can have a huge sampling of the market for popular entertainment,'' Mr. Weiner said. So Mr. Weiner, who played the barker, said that he gave it all he had when he shouted, ''Live Girls!''</p>
        <p>But more important than the chance to draw in new patrons, the company saw itself in league with Show World against what both artists and sex-industry leaders often complain is the Disneyfication of New York. Project 400 had long been considering a production of ''Measure for Measure,'' whose plot involves an attempt to rid Vienna of its prostitutes and immoral citizens.</p>
        <p>When the co-directors heard that Show World was housing plays, they thought the location would be perfect for drawing a parallel between Shakespeare's plot and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's cleanup of Times Square.</p>
        <p>Ticket sales for Nada Show World's three performance spaces vary, but ''The Show World Reunion Show,'' at $12 a ticket, brought in about 75 people each night, Ms Paulus said.</p>
        <p>On a recent Thursday, billed as ''An Evening of Short and Nasty Theater,'' Viveca Gruen, a market researcher, was among the crowd of about 20. ''It was a little scary coming in,'' she said. ''Someone hit on me. But once I found it, it was fine.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Paulus sees a fine line between theater and sex entertainment. ''The question became, when do we acknowledge these things as part of our human nature, and when do we say this is immoral and should be shut down?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>As part of the show, the actors performed lap dances (without nudity, Ms. Paulus said) and accepted tips. A ''flyer guy,'' modeled after the ones who solicit customers for sex shops, passed out leaflets advertising ''live girls.''</p>
        <p>In its efforts to achieve authenticity, the company got help from a veteran Show World floor mopper. ''He would come in and sit and watch the show, and start to direct us,'' Ms. Paulus said. ''He would say, 'There used to be a girl exactly like that here, and if you want to really make her good, she would talk like this,' and then he would do this New Jersey accent.''</p>
        <p>The show was conceived with one particular audience member in mind.''Our fantasy would be that Giuliani would show up,'' Ms. Paulus said. ''He couldn't shut it down, because it would be this Shakespeare play.''</p>
        <p>Herald Price Fahringer, Show World's lawyer, said he liked the idea of Show World's being used as a platform to criticize the mayor. ''You have a great deal of freedom criticizing the administration,'' Mr. Fahringer said. ''The greatness of this city has been due to a high level of tolerance for all forms of entertainment.</p>
        <p>''You can do anything, you can see anything, and that gives people a high sense of self-esteem.''</p>
        <p>To those familiar with the sex industry, the irony is not so much that Show World is showcasing theater, it is that Show World, known for its broad appeal and once called ''the McDonald's of the sex industry'' by William H. Daly, the director of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement, has chosen alternative theater.</p>
        <p>''I think it's more like a Broadway house, in a way,'' said Rachel Shteir, a theater historian whose book on the history of striptease is forthcoming from Oxford University Press. ''It was trying to mass produce sex shows.''</p>
