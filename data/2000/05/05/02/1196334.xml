        <p>Sally Silvers and Dancers  The Kitchen</p>
        <p>The cast fought bravely, yet history finally overwhelmed Sally Silvers and Dancers when the troupe offered Ms. Silvers's ''Storming Heaven'' on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>Revolution was her theme, and Elizabeth Hope Clancy put everyone in bright red costumes. Antonio Martorell's setting was dominated by suspended scrolls adorned with messages written in a fine calligraphic hand that referred to various political upheavals. Mr. Martorell also occasionally stepped on stage to attach scrolls to the dancers.</p>
        <p>Bruce Andrews's taped collage was filled with snippets of music, poetry and speeches. The production was inspired by an opera composed in 1975 by Luigi Nono, who was known for his experimental music and Marxist politics.</p>
        <p>The sights and sounds of ''Storming Heaven'' included allusions to radical actions ranging from the Paris Commune of 1871 to the student rebellions of 1968, as well as revolutions in Russia, Asia and Latin America. The dancers rushed about, marched militantly, gathered in groups as if plotting strategy, embraced as if comforting one another and fell as if shot down in battle.</p>
        <p>Yet, despite its fervor, ''Storming Heaven'' lacked solid thematic content. It too often resembled an anthology of poses taken from political posters.</p>
        <p>Ms. Silvers's revolutions had lots of choreographic energy, but conveyed little sense of blood, sweat and tears. At the end of the work, dancers held up sheets of paper on which one expected to find messages. Instead, one saw only isolated letters of the alphabet. The rebels appeared to be moving on behalf of no specific cause.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, praise should go to these well-drilled dancing revolutionaries: Karl Anderson, Kate Gyllenhaal, Phillip Karg, Andrea Kleine, Paige Martin, Alejandra Martorell, David Neumann, Mark Robison, Cydney Wilkes and Ms. Silvers.</p>
