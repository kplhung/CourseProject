        <p>As the woes of Oedipus and cuckolds of every species attest, there are many instances in which it would be useful to know just how closely related other individuals are to oneself.</p>
        <p>In fact, so great are the evolutionary benefits of being able to dole out goodies like food only to one's close relations or to avoid inbreeding by choosing mates from among nonrelatives that some biologists have predicted that animals may evolve the ability to recognize kin with just a sniff or a look -- a phenomenon known as the ''armpit effect.''</p>
        <p>Now in a new study from Cornell, researchers report what some call the first solid evidence to support this controversial theory. In the paper, published last month in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Dr. Jill M. Mateo, an animal behaviorist, and Dr. Robert E. Johnston, a psychologist, concluded that golden hamsters could recognize relatives they had never met from a group of hamster strangers, simply by giving them a good long sniff. Never having smelled relatives before, the hamsters, researchers say, appear to be using their own body odor as a reference for what family smells like, exactly as the armpit effect predicts.</p>
        <p>Biologists say the logic behind the armpit effect is that some characteristics, including smell, should reflect an animal's genetic makeup. The closer the relationship, the more genes are shared and the more similar, for example, the body bouquet of the two parties should be. But the armpit effect has been difficult to demonstrate and some experts dismissed it as impossible.</p>
        <p>''This is the most convincing demonstration that I've ever seen of the armpit effect,'' said Dr. Wayne Getz, mathematical biologist at University of California, who has looked for the armpit effect in honeybees. The phenomenon got its colorful moniker when the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins suggested that humans would most likely compare underarm odors.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paul Sherman, behavioral ecologist at Cornell, who was not involved with the new study but has looked for the armpit effect in ground squirrels, said, ''This is exciting. It's a viable way of recognizing relatives.''</p>
        <p>Some biologists said the new work suggested that the armpit effect -- in which animals can compare not only their own smells, but appearances or sounds to that of others -- could be widespread among animals, perhaps even humans.</p>
        <p>In fact, researchers say the new study could help explain a number of curious phenomena like the so-called T-shirt study. In that experiment, women were shown to prefer the smells of T-shirts of men who were more genetically dissimilar to them, possibly in unconscious attempts to avoid inbreeding. Scientists now say these women may have been comparing the T-shirt smells to their own as a way of identifying unrelated mates.</p>
        <p>In the armpit effect -- an animal uses only itself as a reference not the look or smell of family members. Previous studies had been unable to rule out the possibility that animals might be using their family's smells as the gold standard, rather than their own in order to claim kin.</p>
        <p>To keep hamsters from experiencing the smells of their real family, researchers removed the tiny hamster pups from their nest within hours of birth, well before they were thought to be able to smell. Having been raised with different-smelling stranger hamsters, the hamsters were then presented with the smells of true siblings or foster siblings. The hamsters only sniffed briefly, an indication that they recognized the smells as family. In contrast, they dashed over to and then lingered much longer at the smells of unrelated strangers -- a typical response for hamsters in defensive mode or in search of mates.</p>
        <p>In some ways, it is astonishing that these hamsters were able to distinguish smells of siblings at all because all the hamsters were closely related to begin with.</p>
        <p>''They're all descended from four hamsters caught in the 1930's,'' said Dr. Mateo. ''If they can do it, natural populations should be able to do it.''</p>
        <p>Scientists had predicted that animals might evolve such keen powers of discrimination because they allowed one to reap potentially huge evolutionary benefits. Animals that can sniff out or spy kin can then provide food or protection to their closest relatives only, even in proportion to the blood-tie closeness.</p>
        <p>Because closer relatives share more genes, animals that provide for their close kin are helping promote the survival and reproduction of their own genes, exactly what natural selection is all about. In addition, many animals -- including humans -- appear to avoid inbreeding, making identifying nonrelatives critical.</p>
        <p>Just what golden hamsters are using their keen powers of genealogical discrimination for in nature remains unknown. Well-known as a laboratory species, golden hamsters have been poorly studied in the wild.</p>
        <p>The new study may also help explain a curious discovery in peacocks. Male peacocks gather in groups to display to females to entice females to mate. In other species, such cooperative males have been found to be closely related, probably because often only one male gets all the matings. But researchers studying peacocks in Whipsnade Park in England, did not expect to find the birds to gather with relatives, since these birds were not raised with relatives and had no way of learning who their relatives were. Somehow though, the peacocks recognized their kin and tended to display with them -- something researchers say might now be chalked up to the armpit effect.</p>
        <p>Other research suggesting that humans may use the armpit effect include studies in small, closed religious groups showing that people tend to avoid marrying genetically similar people. In addition, those couples that were more genetically dissimilar also tended to have fewer miscarriages, suggesting that humans do avoid inbreeding -- perhaps with the help of the armpit effect -- and for good reason.</p>
        <p>The only definitive way to test whether these people, or the women in the T-shirt studies, were using their own smells as clues, as opposed to the smells of their families, would be to do the experiment as was done with the hamsters. Babies would need to be removed at birth, raised with nonrelatives and then tested for their ability to smell out a T-shirt or a mate. Such a study clearly presents more than a few ethical and logistical difficulties.</p>
        <p>There has been much controversy about the armpit effect. Dr. Richard Alexander, behavioral ecologist at the University of Michigan, has repeatedly criticized past studies that tried to show the effect, pointing out their weaknesses. And, he has suggested that on theoretical grounds, such capabilities are unlikely to exist.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alexander also questioned what the hamsters were doing when they became excited by the smells of strangers, but not kin. Dr. Alexander said they might be simply ignoring the smells of relatives, thinking that those were just their own smells. ''They're just making a mistake,'' he said. ''They think, 'Oh, that's me.' ''</p>
        <p>But other researchers say mistake is a misnomer. All that matters, they say, is that the hamsters, for whatever reason, distinguish between kin and nonkin solely by their own smells.</p>
        <p>The new study also raises interesting questions about smells and recognizing relatives. For example, if smell figures so importantly in keeping humans from inbreeding, why is it that humans spend so much on things like deodorants, which hide their message-carrying odors?</p>
