        <p>When Dr. Hasan Baiyev was summoned to his hospital in the Chechen town of Alkhan-Kala on Feb. 1, he quickly learned that it was not for an ordinary case.</p>
        <p>As Russian troops tried to take the capital, Grozny, Chechen rebels began on Jan. 31 to fight their way out. Now hundreds of bloodied militants were waiting for treatment in Dr. Baiyev's village southwest of Grozny. They included Shamil Basayev, the most notorious of the Chechen warlords, who was wounded as he led his fighters through a Russian minefield.</p>
        <p>After administering a local anesthetic, Dr. Baiyev, a surgeon, amputated Mr. Basayev's right leg. And soon after that, the rebels whisked their leader to safety in the Caucasian mountains.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baiyev's life has not been the same since. He said that he was simply carrying out the Hippocratic oath and that he had treated Russian soldiers as well as Chechen fighters.</p>
        <p>But the operation made him a contentious figure in Russia. And he soon decided that this would not be a bad time to spend some time learning about medical care in the United States. ''Nobody likes to recall that I was saving elderly civilians by the thousands,'' he said in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C. ''The only thing they remember is that I was the surgeon who operated on Basayev.''</p>
        <p>Many of Alkhan-Kala's residents had believed that they could ride out the war in the separatist southern Russian region, especially since the rebels had not made the small town a center of their resistance. But Chechnya is also a place where people can get into trouble by trying to avoid taking sides.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baiyev says he is one of them. He grew up in Alkhan-Kala and was trained in dentistry and facial surgery in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk. He worked in a hospital in Grozny but returned to his hometown in October to restore an abandoned hospital. He had a small medical team, including 20 nurses, but was the only surgeon in the town of 20,000, including several thousand refugees.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baiyev had been harassed by both sides during the earlier war in Chechnya. And this time, as Russian troops advanced toward the Chechen lowlands, he initially decided to flee.</p>
        <p>''My parents and relatives kept urging me to leave,'' he said. ''But the night before I was supposed to go, I walked through the village and saw that many people were staying. They thought they could live through it.''</p>
        <p>So Dr. Baiyev took his wife, three children, 86-year-old father and 75-year-old mother to safety in the neighboring Ingushetia region and then returned to his hospital.</p>
        <p>''I told the hospital staff nobody would pay us and that everything they were doing was strictly voluntary,'' he said. ''My plan was to stay despite the bombs and the shelling, to stay until the last minute.''</p>
        <p>It did not take long for the war to come to Alkhan-Kala. In mid-October, the Russians moved to encircle Grozny and to trap Mr. Basayev and his fighters. Alkhan-Kala was caught in the middle.</p>
        <p>After 17 civilians were wounded by a Russian mortar attack, much of the hospital staff left. But Dr. Baiyev stayed on.</p>
        <p>There were also tense moments when a band of Wahabis arrived in the village. This group of militants, under the command of Arbi Barayev, profess a strict version of Islam but have been widely accused of kidnapping people for ransom. They accused Dr. Baiyev of treating Russian soldiers, fired their weapons at the ceiling of the hospital and threatened to shoot him.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baiyev's greatest test came when the thousands of militants tried to escape from the besieged Chechen capital. He learned about it at 6 a.m. on Feb. 1, when he was summoned to his hospital to treat more than 300 wounded fighters.</p>
        <p>''They arrived in the morning,'' he recalled. ''It was news to us. Nobody expected it.''</p>
        <p>For the next two days, Dr. Baiyev ran a one-man emergency room, operating without an anesthesiologist.</p>
        <p>''I was alone and conducted more than 100 operations during the first 24 hours, including 67 amputations and 7 skull surgeries,'' he said. ''It was very difficult. We were basically out of medicine.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Basayev was the second patient. It was something of a reunion. Dr. Baiyev had grown up in Alkhan-Kala with Mr. Basayev, whom he recalls as a quiet child who liked to play chess and later moved to the Chechen mountain town of Vedeno.</p>
        <p>''He was very modest and never stood out among the school children,'' Dr. Baiyev said. ''He followed our national traditions and was very respectful toward elders.''</p>
        <p>The young Mr. Basayev seems to bear scant resemblance to the bearded commander who led a daring raid on Budyonnovsk, a town in southern Russia, in 1995 during the first war in Chechnya, and then spearheaded a rebel invasion of Dagestan, another neighbor of Chechnya, last August, proclaiming that he would establish an Islamic state in the region. That attack sparked the current war in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>Mr. Basayev's roots in the town added a new twist to the story of his escape from Grozny. The Russians say they lured the rebels into a trap. A Russian intelligence agent, they say, promised the militants safe passage out of Grozny in return for a bribe and then directed them toward a minefield that was bracketed by Russian machine guns.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Baiyev said he believed that Mr. Basayev decided to try to escape toward Alkhan-Kala because he knew the terrain there like the back of his hand. Either way, the rebel leader paid a heavy price.</p>
        <p>As a phalanx of fighters blocked access to the operating room, Mr. Basayev was brought in on a stretcher. His right foot had been torn apart by a mine. His fingers were frostbitten because he had been lying in the snow. He was also blind from the concussion effects of the explosion, a condition the doctor thinks was probably temporary.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Basayev was still conscious. The doctor decided to amputate part of his right leg to minimize the risk of gangrene and used a local anesthetic.</p>
        <p>''I asked if it hurt,'' Dr. Baiyev recalled, ''He said, 'Do your business.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Basayev was taken away by his men. Russian officials here say their intelligence reports indicate that Mr. Basayev is now suffering from gangrene and is being carried around on a stretcher by Russian prisoners and kidnap victims. The Russians also say his role as a rebel commander has diminished as a result of his condition. But there is no way to confirm those reports.</p>
        <p>For Dr. Baiyev, the situation in Alkhan-Kala soon went from bad to worse. The Russians were hot on the rebels' trail, and the town was in the way. His hospital was bombed, forcing him to move his operating theater into his home.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 2, Russian soldiers entered the town. The rebel wounded who remained there, Dr. Baiyev recalled, were taken away by a pro-Moscow Chechen militia unit under the command of Bislan Gantamirov, the former Grozny mayor.</p>
        <p>Soon, the Russians came looking for the doctor, complaining to him that he had helped the rebels. Later, with the help of the villagers, Dr. Baiyev made his way to Ingushetia and later to Moscow, where he lived in fear of detention. He finally decided to go to the United States.</p>
        <p>Looking back on his experiences, Dr. Baiyev says he was threatened by both sides for doing his duty as a doctor. He plans to return to Chechnya, but for now is enjoying his study and relaxation in the United States.</p>
        <p>''As a citizen of Chechnya, my tragedy has been to watch my people suffer,'' he said. ''A hospital should be isolated from combat operations. We were at the center of it.''</p>
