        <p>THE HUMAN STAIN  By Philip Roth  361 pages. Houghton Mifflin Company. $26.</p>
        <p>Philip Roth's Pulitzer-Prize winning 1997 novel, ''American Pastoral'' -- the first installment, it would turn out, of a trilogy devoted to postwar American life -- triumphantly demonstrated that he could move beyond the solipsistic presentations of self he had been practicing for years to create a capacious chronicle of American innocence and disillusion.</p>
        <p>Though the second installment of that trilogy (''I Married a Communist,'' 1998) was something of a throwback to Mr. Roth's old mirror games, his latest novel, ''The Human Stain,'' is not only a philosophic bookend to ''Pastoral'' but another large and stirring book as well. It is a book that shows how the public zeitgeist can shape, even destroy, an individual's life, a book that takes all of Mr. Roth's favorite themes of identity and rebellion and generational strife and refracts them not through the narrow prism of the self but through a wide-angle lens that exposes the fissures and discontinuities of 20th-century life.</p>
        <p>At first glance ''The Human Stain'' might seem to be a story about political correctness and 1990's puritanism: there are lots of gratuitous allusions to President Clinton and the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and one of the novel's central plot lines involves accusations of racism and misogyny made against the hero, Coleman Silk. We are told that the elderly Silk, a distinguished professor of classics, has resigned from his post at a small New England college after being accused by black students of using inappropriate language in class. We also learn that he has been pilloried by campus feminists for having an affair with a college janitor, an illiterate 34-year old woman who has a history of being victimized by men.</p>
        <p>As might be expected, Mr. Roth -- or rather, his favorite narrator and longtime alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman -- has a fine time ranting against the ''piety binge'' he sees America indulging in at the close of the century, and he deftly satirizes the ''ecstasy of sanctimony'' practiced by campus commissars of political correctness. Coleman Silk's story, however, turns out to have resonance beyond these topical issues. As told (or reimagined) by Nathan Zuckerman, it is the Gatsby-esque story of a man who has seized the American principle of freedom and used it to shuck off the past and reinvent himself. It is the story of a black man who decided to pass himself off as white.</p>
        <p>This premise seems to have been inspired by the life story of Anatole Broyard -- a critic for The New York Times who died in 1990 -- at least as recounted by Henry Louis Gates Jr. in his 1997 book ''13 Ways of Looking at a Black Man.'' But when stripped of its racial overtones, Mr. Roth's book echoes a story he has told in novel after novel. Indeed, it closely parallels the story of Nathan Zuckerman, himself another dutiful, middle-class boy from New Jersey who rebelled against his family and found himself exiled, ''unbound'' as it were, from his roots.</p>
        <p>In Nathan's case he wrote a scandalous book, was accused of being a self-hating Jew and was disowned by his father. In Coleman's case, he decided to jettison ''the whole ramified Negro thing,'' disowned his mother and was accused by his brother of being a self-hating black. Nathan aspired to join the emancipating world of art; Coleman aspired to free himself from other people's definitions; he wanted to be ''not black, not even white -- just on his own and free.''</p>
        <p>After a stint in the Navy, the light-complexioned Coleman moved to New York and began letting people think he was Jewish. He married a woman named Iris (whose kinky hair, he figured, could explain the texture of his progeny's hair), had four children and spent the next four decades as an academic, leading a ''serious life dedicated to serious things.'' That this life was all based on a lie -- a lie to his wife, his children and his colleagues -- was the trade-off, he supposed, for choosing ''to take the future into his own hands rather than to leave it to an unenlightened society to determine his fate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth does a beautifully nuanced job -- by turns, unnerving, hilarious and sad -- of showing how Coleman lived a double life, a master of equivocation. Though there is the constant fear of exposure, not to mention shame over repudiating his family, there is also the exhilaration of keeping a secret in a ''grand and elaborate way.'' It's a feeling, as Nathan observes, akin to what he experiences when he sits down to write a novel, except that Coleman's book happens to be his life: ''Once you set the thing in motion, your art was being a white man. Being, in your brother's words, 'more white than the whites.' That was your singular act of invention: every day you woke up to be what you had made yourself.''</p>
        <p>This is similar to what Mr. Roth has done throughout much of his career, creating a series of alter egos (from Nathan Zuckerman in the ''Zuckerman Bound'' novels to Peter Tarnopol in ''My Life as a Man'' and Philip in ''Deception''), a gallery of ''cunning self-concoctions'' who embody alternate fates. Like these Rothian doppelgangers, Coleman demonstrates a taste for complicating his life, and like them, he vacillates between two poles: between the dutiful and the Dionysian, between the responsible and the anarchic.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the brouhaha over his use of racist language, it is the Dionysian side of Coleman's personality that suddenly emerges. At age 71, with a little help from Viagra, the professor suddenly throws himself into a torrid affair with one Faunia Farley, an emotionally battered young woman whose apparent inability to read makes Coleman feel liberated from ''the ridiculous quest for significance.''</p>
        <p>Though Faunia's illiteracy feels ridiculously contrived, and though she is initially portrayed in the most patronizing of terms (Mr. Roth goes so far as to write of ''the irreversible futility that is her life''), she gradually emerges as a plausible human being: complicated, conflicted, even sympathetic in her defensive approach to life.</p>
        <p>For that matter, ''The Human Stain'' turns out to be peopled with as rich and variegated a cast as ''American Pastoral.'' While many of these characters start off as simple satiric types -- Faunia's husband, the rage-filled Vietnam vet; Coleman's academic adversary, the snooty French structuralist -- Mr. Roth gradually fills in their cartoonish outlines with painstakingly observed details, allowing them to talk (and talk and talk) their way into becoming people who are both recognizable individuals and embodiments of the age in which Coleman so precipitously falls from grace.</p>
        <p>It is an era, as Nathan describes it, in which fate too often feels accidental, personality can be reduced to gesture, and ''coherence and order'' are elusive: an era delineated in this ample novel with uncommon insight and perception.</p>
