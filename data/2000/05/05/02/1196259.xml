        <p>For more than a month, a giant pair of eyes has  peered down from a billboard along several of this city's expressways with the warning: ''Detroit. All eyes are on you!''</p>
        <p>The billboard was intended to remind residents to mail their 2000 census forms. But the sign is also a stark symbol of a decadeold fear that Detroit could become the first American city of more than one million people to have its population fall below that number. The federal government estimates the city's population at 970,000.</p>
        <p>The city, long dogged by its image as a rusting auto giant, barely made it over million in 1990, and then only after a recount. Staying at a million is a point of pride.</p>
        <p>Census anxiety runs so deep here that Mayor Dennis Archer began drafting his battle plan four years ago. And he has taken the unusual approach of treating the census as a political candidate, stumping all over town on its behalf and imploring residents to view their participation as a vote for Detroit's future.</p>
        <p>''Obviously we've got great American cities that have less than a million people,'' Mr. Archer said. ''And certainly we're not going to fall off into the Detroit River if we drop below a million. But I don't want that to happen. It's a matter of pride.''</p>
        <p>That is why the city has draped itself in Census 2000 paraphernalia: 13,000 lawn signs, 10,000 bumper stickers and scores of banners, all of which were paid for from the city's own budget and are independent of the Census Bureau's promotion blitz.</p>
        <p>What is more striking, at a time when census officials nationally have been worried about low response and lack of community involvement, is the grass-roots support the mayor's effort has won. Thousands of people have turned out to his Call to Action rallies and Census Sunday church meetings. Many -- including schoolchildren -- have donned census T-shirts and taken to the streets promoting the census to anyone who will listen. At least 7,000 people have signed up in an initiative that seeks to draft one person on each of Detroit's 11,000 city blocks who can help census counters get information about neighbors who decline to open their doors. And long before the government mailed out census forms, the mayor's staff was out checking the list of addresses. They turned up  17,000 unregistered addresses.</p>
        <p>''Many cities are working with us to make sure they're on top of the count,'' said Dwight Dean, head of the Census Bureau's Detroit region, which oversees operations in Michigan, Ohio and West Virginia.</p>
        <p>''But I haven't seen a city put in the kind of emotional energy and human resources that Detroit is investing since the 1970's,'' said Mr. Dean, who has also assisted in census efforts in Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles and Denver.</p>
        <p>Businesses are stepping up, too. At the mayor's request, several of the  city's top rival advertising agencies volunteered to create a slogan (''Everybody wins when you mail it in'') and a slick package of accompanying television and radio advertisements. The price of such a package is usually about a half-million dollars, advertising executives say. Owners of beauty salons and coffee shops have partially converted their businesses into census information centers. Local McDonald's owners offered unlimited meals throughout April to any of the nearly 10,000 homeless people here who filled out a census form and received a yellow ''I'm Important I've Been Counted'' pin from census outreach workers.</p>
        <p>''It's like Detroit's gone census crazy,'' said Lydia Bolgard, an assistant at the Coalition of Temporary Shelter, one of Detroit's largest homeless shelters.</p>
        <p>Part of what has made the census such a priority here are the memories of the 1990 census, which even the federal government now concedes undercounted several million people across the country. At the time, Mayor Coleman A. Young was so angered by the count, which pegged Detroit's population below a million, that he discarded it and conducted his own census. After his staff  found more than 100,000 additional people, the official United States census count was adjusted to 1,027,974.</p>
        <p>Because some federal aid is based on population, every uncounted person is a $3,000 loss for the city. Besides that, under a state law, the city in 1990 stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in aid if it dipped below one million. But under Mayor Archer, the law was rewritten, and lowered the population requirement to 750,000 and left Detroit with the authority to increase taxes should its population dip.</p>
        <p>''Detroit's great digit scare is over,'' said Patricia Becker, executive director of the Southeast Michigan Census Council who is also an independent demography consultant. ''If the population is six digits or seven, it doesn't change anything.''</p>
        <p>Except, perhaps, in the eyes of  those who live here. ''This is the Motor City, Motown,'' boasts Maggie Jene Resor, a longtime resident and a census partnership specialist.  ''We've given too much to the world to be known as the city that couldn't keep a million people.''</p>
        <p>There is evidence that Mayor Archer's approach may be working.  Sixty percent of the census forms mailed to the city's 400,000 housing units were returned by the federal government's April 1 deadline. That is up three percentage points over 1990. The United States Census director, Kenneth Prewitt, said he believed that the increase was the result of the mayor's campaign. ''Detroit is easily in the top half-dozen in terms of the quality of effort and commitment that they've put into this,'' Mr. Prewitt said.</p>
        <p>Census counters have until July 7 to find the people who did not respond by mail.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, it was taboo to even speak of the census in Southwest Detroit, a largely Mexican area and home to many undocumented immigrants. Those who were familiar with it feared it, said Maria Elena  Rodriguez, president of the Mexicantown Community Development Corporation. But this time around, Ms. Rodriguez said, the city and the local census office have dispatched so many resources -- including commissioning a mural -- and people to the neighborhood, that even some recent undocumented arrivals have become curious about the process.</p>
        <p>Still, Mayor Archer, a co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee, worries. For every breakthrough, a new hurdle awaits, like the complaints from residents upset that their forms arrived with the address of a nearby suburb. When census officials explained that the forms were bar-coded and would be counted in Detroit's favor, it raised even more suspicions, he said.</p>
        <p>''We've gone to great lengths to assure people the information is absolutely confidential; the I.N.S. can't get it, the F.B.I. can't get it. No one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Archer added, ''This city is 80 percent people of color, and because of that rich diversity, a significant part our population does not trust the federal government. It makes it hard.''</p>
        <p>The mayor is certain of this much: ''We've done everything we know how to do to ensure that Detroit stands up and is counted.''</p>
