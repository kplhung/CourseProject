        <p>A Marriage Replaces a Job</p>
        <p>BOB WEINSTEIN, the less public and less loquacious of the brothers who run Miramax (and the one whose division makes the more violent films), married ANNIE CLAYTON, 31, a former receptionist at Miramax, on Saturday. HARVEY WEINSTEIN, Miramax's co-chairman, was his brother's best man.</p>

        <p>A Marriage Replaces a Job</p>
        <p>BOB WEINSTEIN, the less public and less loquacious of the brothers who run Miramax (and the one whose division makes the more violent films), married ANNIE CLAYTON, 31, a former receptionist at Miramax, on Saturday. HARVEY WEINSTEIN, Miramax's co-chairman, was his brother's best man.</p>
        <p>The guests, who included WES CRAVEN, QUENTIN TARANTINO and JON FRANKENHEIMER, picked up their dinner-table assignment cards beneath a mirror with a heart drawn in lipstick. Another Miramax director, ROBERT RODRIGUEZ, taped a wedding video.</p>
        <p>''When they went for their first dance, he ran out to the dance floor and started to film and continued to film,'' said MARCY GRANADA, a Miramax vice president. ''He was circling and panning and up and down at every angle possible.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Clayton left Miramax when she and Bob Weinstein began dating and they decided it would not be ''appropriate'' for her to work there, Ms. Granada said. Ms. Clayton went to HarperCollins as an assistant editor.</p>
        <p>''Some reference was made in one of the toasts to having to fire her in order to marry her,'' another person who attended the ceremony said. ''That, of course, may not be exactly so, but as hyperbole, it went over well.''</p>
        <p>At ABC, Inroads And Absences</p>
        <p>As of today, the ''rim'' at ''World News Tonight'' is no longer an all-male operation,  and presumably, women on the staff will no longer refer to the people on the rim with epithets like the Promise Keepers, a reference to the evangelical men's group.</p>
        <p>The rim, on the second floor of ABC News headquarters on West 66th Street, is the desk where the network's early-evening broadcast is coordinated. It has seats for the anchor, PETER JENNINGS, and the show's top producers. For at least the last few years, the half-dozen chairs have been occupied by middle-aged white men.</p>
        <p>But PAUL A. SLAVIN, the new executive producer, said yesterday that he had named FIONA CONWAY, a senior producer for special events and a senior producer at ''Good Morning America,'' to oversee domestic coverage.</p>
        <p>''Fiona's not being hired because she's a woman, actually,'' Mr. Slavin said. ''It's just happenstance. Fiona's being hired because I needed a strong newsperson to do domestic coverage for me, someone who was going to improve our coverage, which is always in need of improving, and I'm not criticizng anybody who's done it before.''</p>
        <p>MARK LUKASIEWICZ, the person who did the job until yesterday, will be a kind of deputy, ''taking on projects I should take on if I had more time,'' Mr. Slavin said.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, all those shows on ABC are facing the tree-in-the-forest problem. So for Time Warner cable-television subscribers out there in television land who find themselves wondering about such things, here is what happened on ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' last night.</p>
        <p>ROSIE O'DONNELL, DREW CAREY and DANA CARVEY were on hand for what was billed as a celebrity edition of the show. One of the contestants was KATHIE LEE GIFFORD, REGIS PHILBIN's co-host on his other show, ''Live With Regis and Kathie Lee,'' which is also not being seen on many Time Warner cable systems.</p>
        <p>She had trouble with the $100 question and missed the $64,000 question after using the phone-a-friend lifeline to call the producer of ''Live,'' MICHAEL GELMAN. Bad move. The question was, ''In the 1999 movie 'Sweet and Lowdown,' the main character idolizes what real-life jazz guitarist?'' Mr. Gelman said Les Paul, but the answer was Django Reinhardt.</p>
        <p>Despite Mourning, The Song Goes On</p>
        <p>The tenor ANDREA BOCELLI canceled an appearance at an outdoor concert in Rome yesterday, but changed his mind and sang anyway. RICARDO CORATO, who organized the event, said that after Mr. Bocelli rehearsed on Sunday, he was told that his father had died. He left Rome for Tuscany to be with his family.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Corato said, ''His mother convinced him to perform, saying, 'Your father would love you to be onstage for this occasion,' so at the very last minute we arranged a helicopter to pick him up. Through the army, thank God, because to be frank, as a producer I don't have these powers.''</p>
