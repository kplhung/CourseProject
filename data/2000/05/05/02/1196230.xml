        <p>Researchers from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York are providing new evidence to support an emerging theory that explains how defects in the gene BRCA1 can cause breast cancer.</p>
        <p>BRCA1 was identified in 1994, and its discovery sparked great hope that once scientists figured out how the defects did their damage the secrets of the disease would be unraveled, and would lead to new means of prevention and treatment.</p>
        <p>But so far, theories about how BRCA1 works have come and gone, and scientists are still not entirely sure what the gene does. They do know that BRCA1 is a large gene that directs the body to produce an unusually big protein molecule, and that several hundred different BRCA1 mutations exist, some of which greatly increase a woman's risk of breast and ovarian cancer.</p>
        <p>But most cases of breast cancer in the United States have not been linked to known breast cancer genes: only 5 percent to 7 percent of the 180,000 cases a year are familial, or inherited, and only about half of the inherited cases occur in women with BRCA1 mutations. Another 40 percent are linked to another gene, BRCA2, found in 1995. The nonfamilial cases are not thought to be linked to BRCA mutations, though researchers have debated about whether some of them might be.</p>
        <p>A new report being published today in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences relates to BRCA1's role in the body's natural surveillance system, which helps to prevent cancer. Experiments on human cells in culture by the Mount Sinai team lend support to the idea that BRCA1's normal job is to activate other genes that slow down the reproduction of unruly cells that are multiplying excessively, as occurs in cancer. But when BRCA1 is damaged by a mutation, the signal to slow down is never relayed, and cell division can go on and on unchecked, leading to cancer.</p>
        <p>This explanation fits in with the findings of other studies done during the past few years, which also suggest that BRCA1 helps to switch on genes that rein in cell growth. But the new findings differ from the previous view of BRCA1, which held that the job of the gene was to repair mistakes in DNA that occur when the molecule, which must be copied during cell division, is copied incorrectly. Failure to repair those mistakes is also thought to lead to cancer.</p>
        <p>But the new findings do not mean that the DNA-repair theory is wrong, a member of the Mount Sinai team said.</p>
        <p>''We are not trying to downplay the evidence for a DNA repair function,'' said Dr. Curt Horvath, an author of the Mount Sinai report, along with Dr. Toru Ouchi. Instead, he said, it is possible that BRCA1 does both jobs, controlling cell division and repairing DNA. The gene is the blueprint for an enormous protein molecule, which may have more than one function.</p>
        <p>Dr. Horvath and his colleagues found that the healthy, nonmutated form of BRCA1 plays an essential role in a series of steps needed to stop cells from multiplying uncontrollably.</p>
        <p>''We envision that because of some mutation, a cell becomes neoplastic, meaning its growth is uncontrolled,'' Dr. Horvath said. ''It's the first cell of a tumor.'' Normally, he said, such cells change in ways that allow the cells of the immune system to recognize them as foreign. The immune cells then make a substance called interferon-gamma, which acts as a signal to halt cell division. The protein product of BRCA1 and another protein, called STAT1, are supposed to work together to relay that signal to another gene, which shuts down the cells.</p>
        <p>''But if BRCA1 is mutant, STAT1 can't activate that gene,'' Dr. Horvath said. ''It short-circuits the interferon-gamma signal that normally tells cells to stop dividing.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Horvath said his study was the first to show that BRCA1 has a role in relaying the signal from interferon-gamma, which is one of several types of interferon made by the body to fight tumors and viruses. But he cautioned that his team worked with only one mutant form of BRCA1, and that other mutations might cause cancer in other ways. And like any other preliminary finding, this discovery has to be confirmed by other researchers.</p>
        <p>If the finding does hold up, Dr.  Horvath said, it might point the way toward new treatments. ''If we can understand the way these proteins function in a normal situation and how mutations disrupt that normal function, then we can try to target strategies to compensate for those deficiencies,'' he said. ''It's not in our hands now,'' he added, but he suggested that it might be possible eventually to find another way, perhaps a drug, to activate the gene that normally halts cell division.</p>
        <p>''Or perhaps we could design ways to enhance the STAT1-BRCA1 interaction in people with mutations so that they could still mount this antitumor response,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But, he cautioned, ''I think for BRCA1, since the mutations are all spread out, there's unlikely to be a magic bullet. And there are also the DNA-repair functions to deal with.'' The two types of defect would probably need different types of treatment, he added.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mary-Claire King, a geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and an expert on the BRCA genes, said that Dr. Horvath's findings were unlikely to have an immediate impact on patients. But she also said the experiments were important scientifically and ''make perfect sense'' in the light of other studies that also point to a role for BRCA1 as an activator of other genes.</p>
        <p>In addition, she said, the Mount Sinai experiments added new details about the pathways on which BRCA1 acts.</p>
