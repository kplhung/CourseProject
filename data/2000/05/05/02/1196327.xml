        <p>Twice in three games, the Toronto Maple Leafs' coach and general manager, Pat Quinn, has attempted to shift the focus off his team and on to what he considers questionable tactics by the Devils.</p>
        <p>The strategy might have helped before Game 1, which Toronto won by 2-1. But it did not work tonight. The subject of Quinn's comments this time, Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, was unruffled. Motivated was more like it.</p>

        <p>Twice in three games, the Toronto Maple Leafs' coach and general manager, Pat Quinn, has attempted to shift the focus off his team and on to what he considers questionable tactics by the Devils.</p>
        <p>The strategy might have helped before Game 1, which Toronto won by 2-1. But it did not work tonight. The subject of Quinn's comments this time, Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, was unruffled. Motivated was more like it.</p>
        <p>For the third consecutive game, Stevens helped hold Toronto's top line, featuring Mats Sundin, without a point, and the Devils came within 4 minutes 17 seconds of shutting out the Maple Leafs for the second straight time.</p>
        <p>The Devils settled for a commanding 5-1 victory to take a 2-1 lead in the four-of-seven-game National Hockey League Eastern Conference semifinal series. Game 4 is here Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>''That's all right,'' Stevens said when asked how it felt to be labeled by the Maple Leafs as a dirty player. ''That just inspires me to play harder.''</p>
        <p>At the Maple Leafs' morning skate today, Quinn accused Stevens of trying not once, but twice, to injure Toronto players during the series by hitting them knee on knee.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what that kid on the other side was thinking -- there's two knees he's tried to take out,'' Quinn said, referring to Stevens.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen that before out of him. There's something wrong there.''</p>
        <p>When asked whom he felt Stevens was out to get, Quinn -- who had called the Devils a punch-and-run team before the series opener in Toronto last Thursday -- said that Darcy Tucker was the first one. Quinn did not say who the second Maple Leafs player was.</p>
        <p>Stevens did not have anything to say to reporters before tonight's game. He did, however, have something to say to the Maple Leafs.</p>
        <p>As the final seconds of a scoreless first period were ticking down, Stevens gave Sundin, the Toronto captain, a few whacks with his stick behind the play. Once the horn sounded signaling the end of the period, Stevens had words at the red line with Sundin, along with Steve Thomas -- Stevens's former teammate with the Devils -- and the Toronto tough guy Tie Domi.</p>
        <p>Throughout his 18-year N.H.L. career, Stevens, 36, has become expert at containing the opposing team's top line. But perhaps never more so than this season.</p>
        <p>''This is as good as I've seen him,'' said defenseman Ken Daneyko, who has been Stevens's teammate since Stevens joined the Devils for the 1991-92 season. ''Especially at the end of the year and now.''</p>
        <p>Stevens played in his 11th All-Star Game this season and led the Devils with a plus-minus rating of plus-30.</p>
        <p>Thus far this postseason, the 6-foot-1-inch, 215-pound defenseman has done a brilliant job. He and Brian Rafalski helped hold Pavel Bure -- the league-leading goal scorer with 58 -- to a solitary goal in the Devils' four-game sweep of the Florida Panthers in the first round.</p>
        <p>This series, Stevens's assignment is to shadow Toronto's top line, which is centered by Sundin, with Thomas at right wing and Jonas Hoglund at left wing. Tonight, Stevens and Rafalski, along with the forward line of Steve Kelly, Bobby Holik and Randy McKay, were on the ice every time Sundin's line played at even strength, until the Devils scored their fifth goal.</p>
        <p>This morning, Sundin called Stevens a borderline dirty player, albeit with a smile. Tucker, who scored the winning goal in Game 1, did not go that far. But Tucker did say that he thought Stevens was intentionally trying to knee him when Stevens was attempting to deliver an open-ice hip check midway through the second period of Game 2, which New Jersey won by 1-0.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Stevens did most of his talking with his stick. He whacked at Sundin and Hoglund in front of the net during the second period. And after the Devils scored five goals on eight shots in a 16:19 span that began at 9:42 of the second period, they dominated in their first home game in this series.</p>
        <p>And Sundin's line, thanks in large part to Stevens, was still looking for its first point.</p>
        <p>''You'd think you wouldn't mind the matchup,'' Quinn said after Sundin's line combined for two shots on goal tonight. ''But it wasn't close.''</p>
