      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A 43-year-old hospital secretary was convicted yesterday of having her lover impersonate her husband so he could receive treatment for impotence under her medical insurance policy, including Viagra prescriptions, injections and a penile implant for a total of $1,450. The scheme went awry when the woman's husband received an insurance statement for a penile implant he never received.</p>
        <p>The woman, Jeanne Lewis, will be sentenced by Justice Leslie Crocker Snyder of State Supreme Court in Manhattan on June 15. Ms. Lewis's defense lawyer argued that someone else had assumed her husband's identity, but a jury found her guilty of insurance fraud and forgery after one hour of deliberations. She could be sentenced to up to seven years in prison.</p>

        <p>Prosecutors said they believe that her lover, Andre Dovilas fled the country last year after he was ordered to undergo an examination for the presence of the implant.</p>
