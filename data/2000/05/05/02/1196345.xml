        <p>Publicis S.A. in Paris is to formally announce today that its board has authorized management to enter into talks with Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. in New York, executives close to the negotiations said.

        <p>If the talks between Publicis and Y.&amp; R. make progress, Publicis could announce as soon as this week a deal to acquire Y.&amp; R. for about $5 billion, creating the world's fourth-largest agency company in terms of billings and revenue.
