        <p>On the wall behind Ambassador Volkan Vural's desk at the Turkish mission here is a reproduction of a 1923 Time magazine cover featuring Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who forged modern Turkey out of the wreckage of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
        <p>This summer, Mr. Vural is scheduled to return to Ankara to take up a new post that presents a challenge almost as daunting. His job will be to demonstrate to the European Union that Turkey merits membership and to convince his countrymen that joining the club is worth the painful admission price.</p>
        <p>''This will be a tough job,'' said Mr. Vural, who will need his closeness to Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and both persistence and patience. ''We have to convince Parliament, the ministers and the political parties to support the process of change.''</p>
        <p>After two years at the United Nations and three years as ambassador to Germany, Mr. Vural has developed personal relationships with many of the European diplomats who will be involved in the membership negotiations. But in an interview he was cautious in his optimism and would not make promises about timing, saying only that the goal is be ready for formal talks by 2004.</p>
        <p>Even the timing on his new job is uncertain. While Mr. Vural has been traveling back and forth to Ankara in recent weeks to discuss European Union issues, the position of secretary general for European Union affairs has not yet been created formally by Parliament.</p>
        <p>Right now, Turkey's enthusiasm for European Union membership is at an all-time high. After European leaders agreed in December to let Turkey become a candidate for full membership, a poll for NTV, a Turkish television network, found that two of three Turks favored joining and only one in six opposed it, the same number that had no opinion.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Vural, 58, a former journalist and director of Turkey's state-owned radio and television network, is well aware that public opinion can change and support may ebb as Turkey confronts the political and economic changes required to conform to European Union standards.</p>
        <p>Membership offers tantalizing prospects for prosperity and economic stability, but the costs will be high. For instance, 45 percent of Turkey's workforce is engaged in farming, a number that must be slashed by half or more to be competitive. Overall economic growth, which surged last year, is expected to decline this year as the country battles double-digit inflation.</p>
        <p>Further, the often fractious Parliament will have to completely overhaul half of the country's laws to correspond with the European Union in areas ranging from strengthening environmental rules to abolishing restrictions on free speech.</p>
        <p>The primary obstacles are not economic, according to European diplomats, but instead Turkey's wobbly democracy and the treatment of its Kurdish population. European leaders are troubled by the influence of Turkey's military in government and by the army-backed crackdowns on Kurdish and Islamic politicians.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging room for improvements, some Turkish leaders complain that European Union demands threaten to interfere with internal matters that are vital to national security.</p>
        <p>They also argue that the membership bar is higher for Turkey than for Eastern European countries that may be less prepared. Though Turkey's membership application has been pending since 1987, Poland, Slovakia and other countries that applied more recently have been moved ahead of it in line.</p>
        <p>At a conference on American-Turkish relations in Washington last month, Turkish officials and business leaders were generally upbeat about prospects for European Union membership. But they expressed concern that, even if Turkey meets the European Union's goals, membership might remain outside its grasp.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Vural said signs are promising that Turkey will be ready to open formal membership negotiations within four years and that ultimately it will join the union.</p>
