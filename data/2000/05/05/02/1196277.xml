        <p>Stock prices moved broadly higher yesterday in a session that lacked the volatile swings that characterized so many trading days in April.</p>
        <p>Major market gauges were up from the start. The gains included  technology, led by Microsoft; financial service stocks; major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores; and biotechnology stocks.</p>
        <p>''It was a nice, consistent performance,'' said Michael Clark, head of United States stock trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''It was different from what we have seen in the recent past.''</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average was up 77.87 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,811.78. Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Wal-Mart led the advance in the blue-chip index.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.82 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,468.25. Gains in Cisco Systems, Nortel, EMC and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter helped to fuel the gain.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index continued an advance that began in earnest last week. It rose 97.42 points, or 2.5 percent, to 3,958.08. The index is now down just 2.7 percent for the year. But it is 22 percent below its record high of 5,048.62, set March 10.</p>
        <p>Phil Roth, chief technical market analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the Nasdaq may now be poised to improve. ''The market for Nasdaq stocks made a climactic low in mid-April, tested it in late April and is now in an interim recovery that could continue into the summer,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''But I think this is a temporary recovery in Nasdaq, and that most investors who are overexposed in technology should look for exit points.''</p>
        <p>Small stocks had a good day.</p>
        <p>The Russell 2000 index rose 12.68 points, or 2.5 percent, to 518.93. The Russell is up 2.8 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>Market breadth was good, but trading volumes were light. On the New York Stock Exchange, nearly two stocks rose in price for each one that lost value.</p>
        <p>Volume on the Big Board was 966 million shares. On the Nasdaq stock market 1.47 billion shares changed hands.</p>
        <p>Microsoft was strong yesterday. On its first trading day after the Justice Department and 17 states asked a federal judge to split the company in two, the software giant gained 3 11/16 , to 73 7/16 .</p>
        <p>Even with yesterday's advance, Microsoft shares are down more than 37 percent so far this year. Some analysts said yesterday they see value in the stock.</p>
        <p>Some portfolio managers said, however, Microsoft's stock is likely to remain under a cloud for some time.</p>
        <p>''Do I see value in Microsoft?'' asked Henry Herrman, chief investment officer at Waddell &amp; Reed, which manages about $40 billion in assets. ''Sure I see value. But I also see a company that while not comparable to Philip Morris, will not be a technology leader for quite a while.''</p>
        <p>Other technology stocks that did well included Cisco Systems and the EMC Corporation. Cisco gained 27/64 , to 7 17/16 . And EMC rose 3 3/4, to 142 9/16 .</p>
        <p>Biotechnology stocks had a big day. The Nasdaq biotech index rose 5.2 percent.</p>
        <p>Among the biggest gainers were Genentech, which jumped 11 1/2, to 129; and Human Genomics Sciences, which rose 12 5/8, to 89 3/16 .</p>
        <p>Financial service stocks gained, as investors continued to grapple with how banks and brokerage firms will be affected by further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>Citigroup gained  3/4, to 60 5/16 . J. P. Morgan rose 1 3/8, to 129 3/4. Chase Manhattan climbed 1 5/8, to 73 3/4. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter closed at 79 3/4, up 3.</p>
        <p>Policy Management Systems, a maker of software for insurance and financial service companies, gained 5 3/8, to 18 5/8, after Electronic Data Systems offered to buy the company for $18 to $20 a share in cash.</p>
        <p>But Young &amp; Rubicam fell 5 5/8, to 50 1/16 , after WPP Group said over the weekend that it had pulled out of negotiations to buy the company.</p>
        <p>Despite the improved tone, Mr. Roth from Morgan Stanley Dean Witter said that at some point he expects stocks to fall.</p>
        <p>''Old-economy stocks and new- economy stocks will go down together to build a real bottom,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''And you need to see cash build up in equity accounts. Right now, only 4 percent of money in equity mutual fund accounts is in cash, which is the lowest number ever. That implies to me that portfolio managers are wildly optimistic, which by itself is a reason to be cautious.''</p>

        <p>Treasury Prices Fall</p>
        <p>By Reuters</p>
        <p>Treasury bond prices weakened in thin trading yesterday, still defensive after economic data released last week raised fears of higher inflation and underscored the potential for a more aggressive credit tightening by the Federal Reserve later this month.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 12/32 , to 103 21/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.04 percent from 5.96 percent on Friday.</p>
