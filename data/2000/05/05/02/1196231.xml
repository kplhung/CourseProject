      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In 1996 the young Milan-born conductor Daniele Gatti led a gripping, incisive and altogether impressive performance of Mahler's formidable Sixth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic. He returned two years later to conduct Mahler's Fifth Symphony, and the critical reception that time was not good, and nothing he has done in New York since has equaled the Mahler Sixth. He is back with the Philharmonic, and the Friday morning performance of his program was once again curiously mixed.</p>
        <p>The program was billed as ''Music of Divine Inspiration,'' and while the title was puffy, the selection of music was interesting. Mr. Gatti began with a quite successful performance of Paul Hindemith's seldom-played ''Nobilissima Visione,'' a suite for orchestra that the composer fashioned from the score for his 1938 ballet, choreographed by Leonide Massine, on the life of St. Francis. This is a seminal work from Hindemith's rigorously contrapuntal, humorlessly Neo-Classical period. For all the craft in the music, it's hard to resist poking fun at its rectitude. But Mr. Gatti, conducting from memory and with obvious command, brought out an exploratory quality in the music, a sense of not knowing what's going to happen next as Hindemith's chromatic harmony roams far and wide.</p>

        <p>In 1996 the young Milan-born conductor Daniele Gatti led a gripping, incisive and altogether impressive performance of Mahler's formidable Sixth Symphony with the New York Philharmonic. He returned two years later to conduct Mahler's Fifth Symphony, and the critical reception that time was not good, and nothing he has done in New York since has equaled the Mahler Sixth. He is back with the Philharmonic, and the Friday morning performance of his program was once again curiously mixed.</p>
        <p>The program was billed as ''Music of Divine Inspiration,'' and while the title was puffy, the selection of music was interesting. Mr. Gatti began with a quite successful performance of Paul Hindemith's seldom-played ''Nobilissima Visione,'' a suite for orchestra that the composer fashioned from the score for his 1938 ballet, choreographed by Leonide Massine, on the life of St. Francis. This is a seminal work from Hindemith's rigorously contrapuntal, humorlessly Neo-Classical period. For all the craft in the music, it's hard to resist poking fun at its rectitude. But Mr. Gatti, conducting from memory and with obvious command, brought out an exploratory quality in the music, a sense of not knowing what's going to happen next as Hindemith's chromatic harmony roams far and wide.</p>
        <p>After this was the ''Good Friday Music'' from Wagner's ''Parsifal.'' If Mr. Gatti's account was not especially distinctive, it was rendered with sensitivity, spacious pacing and technical finesse. The orchestra, especially the luminous strings, sounded excellent.</p>
        <p>The work that many other conductors might have performed first Mr. Gatti placed after the intermission: Mozart's ''Jupiter'' Symphony. In doing so he seemed to be indicating that this incomparable masterpiece, though played with the smallest instrumental forces of the concert, was by far the major offering. He may also have been hoping that the audience, having just heard two works steeped in mysticism and religious spirit, would now be primed to appreciate the mystical and titanic qualities of the ''Jupiter.''</p>
        <p>It was a titanic performance, but in a weighty, overly somber way. Mr. Gatti is an assured technician and a musician with a keen ear. Every detail in the piece was attended to; every melodic line and inner voice was shaped and contoured. Mr. Gatti had a clear idea about every phrase. But in a way that was the problem: the performance was didactic and lacked spontaneity.</p>
        <p>Those who were disappointed with his ''Jupiter'' Symphony should not give up on Mr. Gatti. He is obviously gifted and accomplished. And there was that Mahler Sixth.</p>
