        <p>If there is one thing that makes Olivier Messiaen's music enduring, it is the degree to which it lures a listener into a musical universe that is different from all other musical universes and is impossible explain analytically. Messiaen's juxtapositions of soaring melodies and dissonant chordal blocks are not unusual in themselves, nor are his complex rhythmic systems. His stylized use of birdcalls, while certainly a thumbprint of sorts, often seems more a surface detail than a key to the soul of the music, although it gets one closer, in a roundabout way: it links Messiaen with St. Francis of Assisi, the subject of his only opera, and it is an aspect of his attraction to the mystical side of Roman Catholicism.</p>
        <p>Yet that fascination, while clearly the force that drives much of Messiaen's music, confronts the listener as a biographical fact, not as a key to Messiaen's universe. His scores are filled with beautifully poetic phrases meant to explain his symbolism. But those symbols are private, not universal, and the ear hears the music simply as music, however diligently the mind may try to impose Messiaen's symbolism on it. In the end its appeal is in its unusualness, its variety and its sheer power: that is, in its visceral rather than its spiritual aspects.</p>

        <p>If there is one thing that makes Olivier Messiaen's music enduring, it is the degree to which it lures a listener into a musical universe that is different from all other musical universes and is impossible explain analytically. Messiaen's juxtapositions of soaring melodies and dissonant chordal blocks are not unusual in themselves, nor are his complex rhythmic systems. His stylized use of birdcalls, while certainly a thumbprint of sorts, often seems more a surface detail than a key to the soul of the music, although it gets one closer, in a roundabout way: it links Messiaen with St. Francis of Assisi, the subject of his only opera, and it is an aspect of his attraction to the mystical side of Roman Catholicism.</p>
        <p>Yet that fascination, while clearly the force that drives much of Messiaen's music, confronts the listener as a biographical fact, not as a key to Messiaen's universe. His scores are filled with beautifully poetic phrases meant to explain his symbolism. But those symbols are private, not universal, and the ear hears the music simply as music, however diligently the mind may try to impose Messiaen's symbolism on it. In the end its appeal is in its unusualness, its variety and its sheer power: that is, in its visceral rather than its spiritual aspects.</p>
        <p>The ''Turangalila-Symphonie,'' in which Seiji Ozawa led the Boston Symphony on Saturday evening at Carnegie Hall, is one of Messiaen's grandest and most complex pieces. In this 10-movement, 80-minute work, composed between 1946 and 1948, physicality holds the main spotlight. Spirituality is muted, though by no means absent. But the work is meant to be an exploration of both the carnal and the idealized aspects of love, a notion Messiaen drew from the Tristan and Isolde legend.</p>
        <p>Other influences are evident as well: turangalila is a Sanskrit word that suggests, in Messiaen's words, ''a love song, a hymn to joy, time, movement, rhythm, life and death.'' And the rhythmic patterns of Indian ragas are included among the work's musical materials.</p>
        <p>''Turangalila'' is a monster of a work, scored for a huge orchestra with dense brass and percussion sections. It includes both a prominent solo piano line and a crucial part for the ondes martenot, an early electronic instrument that produces an eerie sliding sound. Mr. Ozawa recorded it with the Toronto Symphony about 30 years ago for RCA, and even in the light of more recent, streamlined recordings by more thoroughly polished orchestras, that brisk-paced account still sounds fresh, vibrant and thrillingly energetic.</p>
        <p>The performance Mr. Ozawa led on Saturday evening was quite different, and puzzlingly so. This time his tempos were broader and more portentous, and that took a toll on the work's power and cohesiveness. This time it sounded quaint and dated, sectional rather than flowing. And its most characteristic touches -- the layers of competing rhythms, the exotic melodies and the wailing of the ondes martenot -- sounded like empty novelty devices.</p>
        <p>This is not the fault of the score, which can still pack a wallop. And there were moments when Mr. Ozawa let its power be felt: the climactic fifth movement, ''Joie du Sang des Etoiles,'' as well as the brassy finale were as charged and evocative as could be. The Boston players held up their end of the transaction: the brass and winds played brilliantly, particularly in the finale, the strings brought a wonderful heftiness to the work's most densely scored sections, and the percussionists provided the requisite range of effects, from sparkle to pounding. Pierre-Laurent Aimard gave a fluid account of the piano line; Takashi Harada played the ondes martenot.</p>
