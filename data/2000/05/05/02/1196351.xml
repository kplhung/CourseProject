        <p>Clyde Haberman NYC column discusses use of Nazi metaphors to describe evil; New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's calling Federal agents who grabbed Elian Gonzalez in Miami 'storm troopers', Giuliani being depicted as 'Hitler-like' in his opposition to art exhibit at Brooklyn Museum of Art, St John's basketball coach Mike Jarvis comparing National Collegiate Athletic Assn to 'Gestapo' and Ted Turner likening Rupert Murdoch to 'late fuhrer' (M)</p>

        <p>SAY what you will about the Nazis -- and no doubt a lot will be said today, a day set aside by Jews to recall the Holocaust -- they managed to perform one useful service. They provided some of the most enduring metaphors for evil we are ever likely to see.</p>
        <p>You can try calling someone you hate a Bolshevik, but the word doesn't pack quite the wallop that it used to. Labeling your enemy a fascist carries a punch, but you probably ought to check his ethnicity first to stay out of trouble. Remember Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's lachrymal performance eight years ago, when he turned ''fascist'' into an anti-Italian slur? (By the same token, you may want to avoid shouting ''quisling'' at a Norwegian.)</p>

        <p>SAY what you will about the Nazis -- and no doubt a lot will be said today, a day set aside by Jews to recall the Holocaust -- they managed to perform one useful service. They provided some of the most enduring metaphors for evil we are ever likely to see.</p>
        <p>You can try calling someone you hate a Bolshevik, but the word doesn't pack quite the wallop that it used to. Labeling your enemy a fascist carries a punch, but you probably ought to check his ethnicity first to stay out of trouble. Remember Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's lachrymal performance eight years ago, when he turned ''fascist'' into an anti-Italian slur? (By the same token, you may want to avoid shouting ''quisling'' at a Norwegian.)</p>
        <p>Uber alles -- sorry, over all -- invoking Hitler and his crew is hard to beat for getting really nasty about an opponent. Maybe that's why so many people seem unable to resist the temptation, including politicians who claim to know better and find Nazi imagery to be deplorable when it is aimed at them. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani comes to mind.</p>
        <p>The mayor went to town last week with the phrase ''storm troopers.'' That is what he repeatedly called the federal agents who had grabbed Elian Gonzalez in Miami and returned him to his father.</p>
        <p>When objections were raised -- by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Anti-Defamation League and members of the New York Congressional delegation, among others -- Mr. Giuliani stood his ground.</p>
        <p>It may be useful to note that the real storm troopers -- Sturmabteilung, in German -- were the muscle behind Hitler's ''beer hall putsch'' of 1923 and his rise to power 10 years later. Details can be found in the Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, compiled by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>Sturmabteilung members, the encyclopedia says, ''were drafted into the auxiliary police, and as such they arrested, tortured and terrorized political, ideological and personal enemies in abandoned barracks or factory yards that became known as concentration camps.''</p>
        <p>Does that sound to you like an apt description of the men and women who reunited a little Cuban boy and his papa?</p>
        <p>As protests over his remarks continued, Mr. Giuliani allowed that he did not mean to attack the agents themselves, but rather President Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno. That, by extension, would seem to make Mr. Clinton and Ms. Reno equivalent to Hitler and Hermann Goring. True, the president once had a cabinet secretary named Reich. But does that put him in the Nazis' class?</p>
        <p>AN interesting twist to this political spat is that it is usually the mayor who ends up on the receiving end of over-the-top Nazi imagery. Understandably, he has not liked it one bit.</p>
        <p>Protesters have carried placards caricaturing him with a Hitlerian mustache. His emergency crisis center downtown has been derided as his bunker. Comparisons between him and the Third Reich are amply suggested in an exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>
        <p>A show like the Whitney's, Mr. Giuliani complained, cheapens the Holocaust and its meaning. Last year, when he was likened to Hitler during protests over the police killing of Amadou Diallo, he had this to say: ''Invocations of Adolf Hitler are despicable no matter who it is. Nobody should participate in it, and nobody should do it.''</p>
        <p>Yet the appeal of this imagery remains strong, going well beyond the mayor and his critics.</p>
        <p>An angry Mike Jarvis, the basketball coach at St. John's University, recently compared the National Collegiate Athletic Association to the Gestapo. Ted Turner has likened Rupert Murdoch to ''the late Fuhrer.'' You no doubt remember Jerry Seinfeld's Soup Nazi as though the problem with the Nazis was that they could be grumpy.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, this imagery can be inadvertent, as it was in 1998 when Commissioner Jason A. Turner of the city's Human Resources Administration defended his welfare-to-work program by saying, ''Work makes you free.'' It seems to have eluded Mr. Turner that those very words -- ''Ar beit macht frei,'' in German -- appeared on the gates of Nazi concentration camps.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, Nazi imagery can be as dopey as it is offensive. We have in mind a West Side woman who was so enraged by a Parks Department crackdown on lawbreaking dog owners that she said with trembling hands, ''I'm beginning to understand how Jews felt in Nazi Germany.''</p>
        <p>Maybe we need some new adult education courses, to explain the world of difference between a pooch and a putsch.</p>
