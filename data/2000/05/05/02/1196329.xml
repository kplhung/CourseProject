        <p>When his superiors discovered that an army colonel had invited civilian friends to an official firing range recently to have fun shooting guns, they quickly hushed the matter up, saying a scandal might cause the public to lose trust in the military.</p>
        <p>When the director of an orphanage in Kyoto recently found evidence of child abuse by a longtime employee, he concealed the crime for nearly a year, explaining later that he had kept silent ''out of consideration'' for the worker's future prospects.</p>
        <p>Then there was the recent double-barreled police scandal in the prefecture of Niigata that was front-page news throughout Japan for weeks. A senior national police official, who was sent to the town in mid-January to carry out a scheduled inspection of the local police department, instead repaired with the Niigata police chief to a nearby spa for drinks and games of mah-jongg.</p>
        <p>Their partying came to light because on that same day, the Niigata police were dealing with their biggest case in years -- the discovery of a kidnapped girl who had been missing for nine years -- and questions were raised about why the chief was not on the scene.</p>
        <p>Apparently to enhance their crime-fighting image, the police also claimed to have found the girl, but it turned out that she had been discovered by social workers.</p>
        <p>Speaking of the affair before Parliament, Keizo Obuchi, who was then the prime minister, shocked many people by saying he felt that the inspector had merely been unlucky to have been revealed shirking his duties because of all of the attention suddenly cast upon Niigata, a normally sleepy city of a half-million inhabitants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obuchi's comments, and the widespread criticism that followed them, have fueled a mushrooming debate over what many see as a crisis of public accountability in Japan. A spate of ill-concealed scandals has cast a pall over the government and other public institutions like the police.</p>
        <p>The debate had its biggest public airing over Mr. Obuchi's own collapse from a stroke early in April. His condition was hidden from the public for 22 hours by a government that went on to dissemble about events surrounding the prime minister's health for at least two more days.</p>
        <p>On the morning after his late-night hospitalization, reporters were told that he was working normally in his residence. That evening, the public was told that the prime minister had been hospitalized for exhaustion.</p>
        <p>Only the day after that, when succession politics had already been worked out in secret, was it disclosed that Mr. Obuchi had suffered an incapacitating stroke. Bit by bit it emerged that Mikio Aoki, the caretaker leader who filled the vacuum until a new prime minister took office, had stated falsely that Mr. Obuchi had been conscious throughout the day of his stroke.</p>
        <p>That statement was ostensibly made to lend credibility to Mr. Aoki's assertion that he been asked by Mr. Obuchi to hold the reins of power on his behalf.</p>
        <p>Editorial writers, members of civic groups and experts in government say the ham-handed instances of official dishonesty in cases like these are eroding the once high level of faith of ordinary people in public institutions. They say such behavior comes from a bankrupt ethical culture that typically values appearances far more than the truth.</p>
        <p>In a recent national poll in the leading daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun, for example, 60 percent of respondents said they distrusted the police. According to the newspaper, in previous polls as recently as 1998, no fewer than 69 percent of those who responded said they had faith in the police.</p>
        <p>On the floor of Parliament in mid-April, the leader of the opposition, Yukio Hatoyama, drew a direct link between the handling of Mr. Obuchi's stroke and other recent scandals. The prime minister's health crisis, he said, was handled ''without transparency, with secretive discussions and a mass of falsifications, and the same could be said of the police scandals.''</p>
        <p>But for many Japanese, the Obuchi affair seemed to be yet another example of the murky way in which power has long been wielded in this country, contributing to widespread feelings of powerlessness and apathy about politics.</p>
        <p>A venerable expression here about the attitude that governors should hold toward the governed is not far off the mark, even in the Internet age. ''We should not inform the people,'' the saying goes. ''They must depend upon us.''</p>
        <p>The most extreme example involves the death penalty. A family of a prisoner on death row is notified of the execution only after the fact.</p>
        <p>Another telling sign of how prevalent such attitudes toward information and public service remain is that the Japanese language lacks a word to express neatly the idea of accountability. When the subject comes up here, the English word is most often used.</p>
        <p>Even if apathy is prevalent, a number of commentators have begun to denounce the culture of concealment and opacity, which they say is dangerously corrosive to this country's democracy.</p>
        <p>Common explanations of the way that even seemingly innocuous information is closely held by politicians, corporations and groups of ordinary people often focus on Japan's insular village culture, which developed over centuries of rural near-isolation.</p>
        <p>One result, according to these theories, is a society built from tightly knit groups, in which decisions are made by consensus, authority is rarely questioned and a premium is placed not on openness, but on avoiding shame or embarrassment for the group.</p>
        <p>When problems do surface, the preferred solution is typically ritualized apology, resignation and, in extreme cases, suicide. Forthrightly dealing with the facts of the wrongdoing is typically avoided.</p>
        <p>For example, the Niigata police, finally apologizing for lying about their discovery of the missing girl, contended that they had sought to avoid creating a nuisance for the social service workers who had found her.</p>
        <p>Hisatake Kato, a professor of ethics at Kyoto University, cited the recent nuclear accident in Japan as another example of this type of approach.</p>
        <p>Everyone knew that the proper procedures were not being followed, he said, but they remained silent. In the United States, he said, ''in the case of the Three Mile Island accident, whistle-blowing helped prevent a far worse disaster.''</p>
        <p>The dangerous procedures in Japan came to light only after an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction broke out at the plant in question, in Tokaimura, last October, killing two workers and contaminating hundreds of people in the town with dangerous levels of radiation.</p>
        <p>''In Japan, even if there is some kind of misconduct in an organization that you belong to, what you are supposed to do in this culture is avoid leaking the information to the outside,'' Mr. Kato said. ''That is what is considered public morality in Japan.''</p>
        <p>Deeply held attitudes like those perhaps explain why despite the protests by journalists, there was relatively little popular outcry after the government's clearly deceptive handling of the news of Mr. Obuchi's stroke.</p>
        <p>The passage last spring of a freedom of information act modeled on similar laws in the United States has the potential to revolutionize people's access to official information in Japan. But because of the relative lack of public pressure, activists who helped bring about the law's passage say its impact has so far been small.</p>
        <p>''This society has a very low interest in what the government is doing,'' said Shigeki Okutsu, director of the Information Clearinghouse, a group that pushed for the law. ''But also, the government has very little regard for what people think.''</p>
