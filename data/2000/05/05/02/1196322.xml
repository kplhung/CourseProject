        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Like a Doctor's Office, With a Little More Time,'' (April 25):</p>
        <p>While it is true that we doctors have less time to spend with patients than we used to, the blame for this lies solely with managed care.</p>
        <p>The managed care/insurance industry's solution to control costs is to put less qualified (i.e., less expensive) paramedical personnel in positions of greater responsibility and to deceive the public as to their motive (i.e., protecting their profits).</p>
        <p>Collaboration with doctors to provide for health maintenance and preventive care is one thing, but putting nurse practitioners in the role of diagnosing and treating complicated illnesses is quite another.</p>
        <p>The exhaustive education and high standards for physicians in the United States is essential to maintain the quality of medical care in this country.</p>
        <p>To suggest that less qualified professionals can provide an equal substitute to trained physicians is an insult to our profession and a danger to our patients.</p>
        <p>DR . EDWARD  S. LEVY  St. Louis</p>
