        <p>SCHLANGER-Nathalie G., Age 87, on April 29, 2000, at her home in Mount Vernon, New York. Mrs. Schlanger, the daughter of the late Asher and Miriam Gutkowsky Glickson, was born and raised in Norwalk, Connecticut. She graduated from Vassar College, and later from Columbia University. She married Dr. Samuel Schlanger in New York City in 1936, and was his loving and devoted wife until his death in 1987. She was a wonderful mother to her sons Robert (who predeceased her) and Michael, a wonderful grandmother to her grandsons Teddy, Nicholas and Ben, and a wonderful mother in-law to her daughter-in-law, Barbara. She is also survived by numerous cousins, nieces and nephews. For many years, Mrs. Schlanger was the Senior Psychotherapist at the Pleasantville Cottage School, where she helped generations of adolescent boys and girls progress to healthy adulthood. Mrs. Schlanger, who lived in the same house in Mount Vernon for 55 years, also devoted four decades of her free time to the performance of good works for the benefit of the Mount Vernon community, including service as the Chairman of the Mount Vernon Public Library, the Mount Vernon YM - YWHA, the Pennington School Parent-Teacher Association, and ad hoc boards and committees, including the one whose activities led to the building of Mount Vernon High School and to the consolidation of public high school education in the city. In lieu of flower, contributions can be made to the Mount Vernon Hospital, 12 North 7th Avenue, Mount Vernon, New York 10550.</p>
