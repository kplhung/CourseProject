        <p>The Giuliani administration announced plans yesterday to establish an $8 million fund to help commercial printing and graphic arts companies that want to relocate within New York City.</p>
        <p>Under the program, which is intended to assist a growing number of printers and graphic artists who find themselves priced out of commercial space in the city, the companies can receive up to 50 percent of their moving costs, with a limit of $200,000 per company, officials said. Robert M. Harding, the deputy mayor for economic development and finance, said  the goal was to ''help companies take advantage of affordable opportunities in today's booming real estate market, ensuring the long-term growth'' of the printing industry.</p>
