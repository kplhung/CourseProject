        <p>The foreign policy chief for the European Union, Javier Solana, said today that European officials were concerned about the potentially damaging effects that the Clinton administration plan for missile defense could have on Europe's security ties with the United States.</p>
        <p>If Europe is not protected by the missile shield, such a system could lead to ''decoupling,'' a splintering in military ties, between the United States and its NATO allies, Mr. Solana said.</p>
        <p>''If we were not to be defended by the United States, that may risk the beginning of 'decoupling,' '' he told reporters here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solana, the former secretary general of NATO who is leading the European Union efforts to build a defense force that would complement NATO, said if the American system moved ahead it must not ''strain trans-Atlantic links'' or provoke a ''a major crisis with Russia.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Solana is meeting senior administration officials to discuss the European Union defense plan and to learn about the administration talks with Russia on the planned missile defense. President Clinton is scheduled to attend a summit meeting of the European Union in Lisbon before meeting President-elect Vladimir V. Putin of Russia early next month in Moscow. In both arenas, missile defense will be a major topic.</p>
        <p>Western European leaders -- some more than others -- have publicly questioned the necessity of the plan to construct a limited defense  intended to protect against the missiles of ''rogue'' states like North Korea. The Europeans question the depth of the threats from those countries. Some like Iraq, Iran and Libya are much closer to Europe than to the United States.</p>
        <p>In Germany, a senior foreign ministry official, Karsten Vogt, said recently the limited defense planned by the Clinton administration -- which would protect the United States, but not Europe -- would lead to a weakening of the military ties between the United States and its European allies. Mr. Vogt also said Germany did not agree with the assessment of the seriousness of a threat from the ''rogue'' states.</p>
        <p>In London last month, Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was visited by Mr. Putin, publicly said his government would try to help resolve the differences between Russia and the United States on missile defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin has opposed the administration efforts to amend the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, considered the basis of cold-war arms control, to allow a missile defense system. The ABM treaty prohibits defense systems such as the one being tested. To proceed with its plan, the administration has to persuade Mr. Putin to amend the treaty or the United States has to pull out of it.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said Mr. Blair had played a constructive role with Mr. Putin by asking him to think seriously about the threat from ''rogue'' nations and also emphasizing that the administration wanted just a modest change to the ABM treaty that would keep its spirit intact.</p>
        <p>The British position is critical for the administration. Behind the scenes, British officials have been deeply skeptical of the plan and questioned why Washington would want to push ahead with a scheme that would protect the United States but not Britain. And although it would not protect Britain, an American early warning radar in Britain to monitor Russian missiles would have to be modified under the American plans so that it could detect missiles from North Korea.</p>
        <p>In his talk with reporters, Mr. Solana, a physicist by training, said he understood the compulsion that politicians felt about moving toward missile defense. ''If you are a country and you have risks and you have the technology, it's very hard for a leader not to use it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''You have to weigh the consequences for the rest of the world.''</p>
        <p>Among the worries for Europe if the United States goes ahead is not only a deterioration of relations with Russia, but also with China. Europeans also worry that the system could lead to an arms race that the ABM treaty was intended to avoid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solana said missile defense had not reached the front burner of public debate in Europe. But he appeared to be reflecting an undercurrent of concern that if the United States put such a system into effect, Europe would be left more vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, has described the European quandary this way: ''Either they differentiate their security from that of the United States, thus bringing about the very decoupling they fear, or they acquire a similar degree of protection by deploying missiles of their own.''</p>
