        <p>Opportunity is running out for Shane Spencer, like grains of sand plunging through an hourglass. He does not know how much time he has left to show he can play, but he has been around the Yankees long enough to know that any losing streak leads to change.</p>
        <p>Spencer is building credentials, however. His two-run double produced the Yankees' runs as they edged Cleveland, 2-1, tonight at Jacobs Field.

        <p>Opportunity is running out for Shane Spencer, like grains of sand plunging through an hourglass. He does not know how much time he has left to show he can play, but he has been around the Yankees long enough to know that any losing streak leads to change.</p>
        <p>Spencer is building credentials, however. His two-run double produced the Yankees' runs as they edged Cleveland, 2-1, tonight at Jacobs Field. Ramiro Mendoza disguised his lack of raw stuff, deceiving the Indians for six innings before the Yankees' bullpen took over in seventh. Rain delayed the start of the game for 2 hours 44 minutes.</p>
        <p>Adding another to their list of dramatic victories, the Yankees escaped a two-on, no-out situation in the bottom of the ninth. David Justice led off with a single and moved to third when Jim Thome doubled into the right-field corner. With Alex Ramirez in as a pinch-runner for Thome, Mariano Rivera struck out Richie Sexson swinging for the first out.</p>
        <p>Travis Fryman, who was 3 for 3, fell behind no balls and two strikes before lining out to left field. Ramirez took off toward third, assuming the ball would drop, and was doubled off second when Spencer threw to Derek Jeter to give Rivera a very shaky eighth save.</p>
        <p>The Indians loaded the bases against Jeff Nelson and Rivera in the bottom of the eighth, but with two outs, Rivera retired Manny Ramirez on a weak grounder; Ramirez is 0 for 10 in his career against the Yankees' closer. The Yankees' bullpen has an earned run average of just 1.44 over the last 10 games.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' record will go a long way toward determining how much time Ricky Ledee and Spencer are given to prove themselves, Manager Joe Torre said before tonight's game. The Yankees have won two-thirds of their 24 games, and although they have not played all that well, they can afford to wait before determining what trades they need to make to augment their roster for the final months of the regular season and the postseason.</p>
        <p>Ledee's average is plummeting far below .200, a decline that is resulting in a grimace on his face, his head hanging down. Spencer's average has been hovering above .200, but he seems much less bothered than Ledee does about the uncertainty of his situation -- not surprising, one member of the organization remarked, for Spencer spent almost a decade in the minors overcoming the perception that he was not good enough to play in the majors. There were several seasons in his career when he faced the possibility of being released if he did not produce.</p>
        <p>Torre maintains that nothing has changed for Spencer and Ledee, but there has been a subtle adjustment in how Torre is handling the two. Ledee was the left fielder and Spencer the designated hitter for much of the first month. But last week, Torre began using Spencer in left and Ledee at designated hitter so that he would be in a better position to counter a move if the opposing manager called on a left-handed reliever to face Ledee late in games; this way, Torre could use someone like Jim Leyritz to pinch-hit for Ledee without worrying about who would play the outfield.</p>
        <p>If Ledee were hitting the way he did at the end of spring training, however, then Torre would not be pinch-hitting for him.</p>
        <p>Back to playing in the field, Spencer had two hits Sunday, including a two-run homer, and tonight he propelled the Yankees into the lead. Jaret Wright, nearly traded to San Diego for Sterling Hitchcock on the eve of the season opener, had an overpowering fastball, and he shut out the Yankees through four innings, matching Mendoza.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez lined a single leading off the fifth, however, and Jorge Posada dumped a double down the left-field line and into the corner, Martinez stopping at third. Wright challenged Spencer, throwing a 98-mile-an-hour fastball that Spencer swung through to make the count no balls and two strikes. Spencer fouled off a fastball and two sliders as the count went to 1-2.</p>
        <p>Wright tried another slider, a pitch that confounded Spencer last year. Spencer pulled a grounder down the third-base line, hesitating for a split second, thinking it might go foul. And this is where the Yankees got a little lucky.</p>
        <p>Fryman, the Cleveland third baseman, moved over to field the ball as Martinez sprinted homeward, and Spencer's grounder hit the base and bounced over Fryman's head. Martinez and Posada scored, and Spencer rambled into second base, fortunate only because he had given himself a chance with his persistent at-bat against Wright.</p>
        <p>Mendoza was persistent as well, in a different way. Mendoza is a sinkerball pitcher, and right now, his sinker is not sinking. Mendoza usually averages about 2.2 grounders for every fly ball, but this year, his ratio has been .86 grounders for every fly ball. Mendoza usually wins or loses with his sinker, and by that standard, he should have been hammered tonight.</p>
        <p>But Posada helped Mendoza through the game, eschewing the sinker in some situations, relying more on pitches thrown at varying speeds, the curveball of 72 to 73 miles per hour, the changeup of 82 to 83 m.p.h., rather than the meaty 89 m.p.h. sinker. The Indians kept getting healthy swings at Mendoza, their timing off just slightly -- except for Thome, who bashed a tremendous homer leading off the fifth. Incredibly, Mendoza allowed just one run in six innings before Torre went to the bullpen.</p>
