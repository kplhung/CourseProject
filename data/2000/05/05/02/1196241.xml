        <p>The re-reopening of the final final-status talks between Israelis and Palestinians in Eilat yesterday provides an illuminating snapshot of where Israeli-Arab negotiations are now. To put it bluntly: The Palestinians want to say yes to a deal but are waiting for the goods from Israel; and the Syrians, who have all the goods they could want from Israel, don't know how to say yes.</p>
        <p>Israeli and Palestinian leaders know exactly what the outlines of their deal will be: The Palestinians will get back 90 percent of the West Bank and Gaza for their own state, and Israel will keep 10 percent -- the 10 percent of the West Bank where 80 percent of Israeli settlers live. The big question is whether the Israeli and Palestinian ruling coalitions can hold together for such a tough compromise. Don't kid yourself -- we're approaching the moment of truth here, and for both Israelis and Palestinians it could be a moment of civil war.</p>
        <p>True, Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, got off to a slow start. For a general who said he was not much of a politician, Mr. Barak spent a lot of time looking at polls. His clear preference was also to get the Israeli-Syrian deal done first -- a deal for which he had much more of an innate feel, because it is a deal about how two armies live apart. The Israeli-Palestinian talks, by contrast, are about how two communities live together. The negotiations with the Palestinians required the development of trust; the negotiations with the Syrians were built on the absence of trust.</p>
        <p>But since Syria's president, Hafez al-Assad, stiffed President Clinton in Geneva a few weeks ago, Mr. Barak has thrown himself into the Palestinian talks. What happened with the Syrians was that their foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, had indicated to the Israelis and Americans that ''the lake'' -- that is, the Sea of Galilee in northern Israel -- would remain entirely in Israel's hands. When President Assad met with President Clinton, though, he insisted that the northeastern shore and northeastern portion of the lake had been Syria's before the 1967 war, and would have to be returned to Syrian control along with the Golan Heights. Mr. Shara said the lake was Israel's; Mr. Assad said the lake was Syria's; Mr. Barak said: ''You can have the Golan back, but no lake. See you later. I'm going to talk to the Palestinians.''</p>
        <p>Since then, Mr. Barak has made two key moves. First, he's buying off the Shas ultra-Orthodox party, a key coalition partner. Shas's religious schools are bankrupt and it desperately needs state funds. Mr. Barak is offering Shas the money it wants -- if Shas agrees to deliver its key votes to support any settlement Mr. Barak strikes with the Palestinians. Mr. Barak is also moving toward giving Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, full control of the Palestinian village of Abu Dis, which is just outside the boundary of Jerusalem and could serve as the foundation for the Palestinians' own capital in the Jerusalem area -- without Israel's having to redivide the city in any way.</p>
        <p>These moves, which are already being resisted by all the rightist parties in Israel, are aimed at pressuring Mr. Arafat to start preparing Palestinians for their tough compromise. That means preparing Palestinians for getting only 90 percent of the territories back, not 100 percent; preparing them for getting only a symbolic return of Palestinian refugees -- in the form of family reunifications -- to pre-1967 Israel; and preparing them for having their own Jerusalem -- which they can call by Jerusalem's Arabic name, Al-Quds -- in Abu Dis, rather than in the old, eastern half of the city.</p>
        <p>''Arafat needs to find a way to take these Palestinian mantras -- Jerusalem, refugees, territory -- and redefine them in a way that defuses them as political issues for the Israeli public,'' argues Stephen P. Cohen of the Center for Middle East Peace. ''If he does that, he can get 90 percent of the West Bank back, which, after all these years of struggle, would be amazing. But Barak and the Israeli people are going to have to be mature enough to understand that these classic Palestinian mantras can't simply be thrown out by Arafat, but must be reshaped in a way that Israelis and Palestinians can both live with.''</p>
        <p>This is not a test. This is the real deal. Completing it and implementing it are going to be wrenching experiences for both societies. Not doing so will be a disaster.</p>
