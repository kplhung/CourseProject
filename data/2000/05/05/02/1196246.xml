        <p>The Motley Fool is expected to announce today that C. Patrick Garner, a Coca-Cola Company executive, will become its new chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garner, 52, was most recently president of Coca-Cola's Southeast and West Asia division and has spent three decades at the company.</p>
        <p>''Pat comes with a lot of operating experience, brand experience and tremendous intellectual curiosity,'' said Tom Gardner, a founder of the Motley Fool. He noted that it had recently added several experienced executives to its management team.</p>
        <p>Created as a newsletter in 1993, the Motley Fool has developed into a popular personal finance site on the Internet. It features irreverent stock commentary by Mr. Gardner and his brother, David, and lively participation from the site's thousands of daily users. The company, which is based in Alexandria, Va., has about 320 employees and has sites in Britain and Germany. It does not disclose its annual sales.</p>
        <p>While the company has no immediate plans to go public, it expects to at some point, Tom Gardner said.</p>
        <p>The Gardner brothers will continue to serve as co-chairmen of the company, focusing on strategy and extending the Fool brand in other countries and in other venues. ''Tom and David are really the ambassadors of this business,'' Mr. Garner said. Erik Rydholm, who also helped found the business, will continue to oversee its operations and production.</p>
