        <p>Not even John Schuerholz, baseball's master architect, is exempt.</p>
        <p>The team he designed and has redesigned annually was riding a 13-game winning streak yesterday, and where was Schuerholz? Not in Los Angeles, where the Braves gained a club-record 14th victory in a row last night. Not in Richmond, Va., or Myrtle Beach, S.C., scrutinizing the organization's minor league talent for the next Rafael Furcal. Not even at his desk in the Braves' offices at 755 Hank Aaron Drive.</p>
        <p>No, John Schuerholz was in an Atlanta courthouse on jury duty. Well, better Schuerholz than Andres Galarraga or Tom Glavine.</p>
        <p>Schuerholz, however, could be away from the office and away from the team content with the knowledge that the Braves are yet again the wonder of Major League Baseball.</p>
        <p>Sure, the Yankees are in first place in pursuit of their third consecutive World Series championship and the St. Louis Cardinals are bashing everyone in sight and the Chicago White Sox have captured the attention of people looking for good young teams and Chuck Finley has the Cleveland Indians thinking that yes, this could be the year they beat the darn Yankees, and Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson are staging an every-fifth-day domination of their teams' opponents.</p>
        <p>But over there at the side, quietly going about their business, not letting anyone forget that they are the one constant Major League Baseball has had for a decade, are the Braves. Eight successive seasons as division champions, the Braves have the best won-lost record in sight en route to No. 9.</p>
        <p>As much frustration as the Braves have suffered by winning only one World Series in those eight years, they inflict even more frustration on teams trying to keep up with or overtake them. In the immediate instance, the team that most fits that description is the Mets, a wild-card team seriously seeking entry to the postseason party as a division winner. Yet, the Mets have won 11 of their last 15 games and have lost three and a half games in the National League East to the Braves.</p>
        <p>Two and a half weeks ago, neither team was in first place, but the Braves were a half game closer to it than the Mets. Now, after the Braves' 2-1 victory over the Dodgers and the Mets' 10-3 loss in San Francisco last night, the Braves are in first place and the Mets are in second, four games back.</p>
        <p>''It's not frustrating yet,'' Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said by telephone after arriving in San Francisco yesterday. ''It's less frustrating this early in the season than if it was July or August and we put a run like that together. But it's to be expected. We didn't expect the Braves to fold up and go away. They won 104 games last year without Galarraga and without Lopez for most of the season. You know they're going to win their share of games.''</p>
        <p>The Braves' share of victories is just greater than other teams' shares. In 1993, for example, the Giants won 103 games, but the Braves won 104. The difference developed on the last day of the season. The teams began that day with 103 victories each and a share of first place but ended it traveling in different directions, the Braves to the playoffs, the Giants home. These days, at least, a team in the Giants' position could be the wild-card team.</p>
        <p>''There's no question the Braves have a very good team,'' Phillips said. ''They're not missing a beat this year. They're hitting on all cylinders now. I feel good that with the streak they've put together, we're only three games behind. We're not hitting on all cylinders.''</p>
        <p>The most impressive of the Braves' eight cylinders is Galarraga, whose comeback has been as phenomenal as any has ever been. The venerable Venezuelan missed all of last season undergoing treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and, seven weeks shy of his 39th birthday, he is among the National League leaders in home runs (10), runs batted in (24) and slugging percentage (.683).</p>
        <p>When Schuerholz was designing the 2000 Braves last winter, he figured that if the first baseman could come back, it would be as if the team had acquired an additional player. It was one fewer trade he had to make or free agent he had to sign.</p>
        <p>Javier Lopez is back, too, recovering successfully from knee surgery for a torn ligament and rendering false the whispers around the league that had suggested he would never catch again.</p>
        <p>Besides the initial uncertainty about Galarraga and Lopez, the Braves faced fallout from the John Rocker suspension for boorish verbal behavior and the problem of replacing John Smoltz, one of their top pitching stalwarts, whose injured elbow knocked him out for the season.</p>
        <p>The Rocker issue proved to be no distraction. The closer, in fact, returned after the first victory of the winning streak and gained six saves in an 11-victory span. Smoltz's absence has yet to be felt, too. Terry Mulholland, his replacement, was the winning pitcher in the first game of the winning streak as well as the 5th and the 10th.</p>
        <p>Greg Maddux has been himself  (4-0, 2.49 earned run average) and Glavine has been spectacular (5-0, 1.80) as the Braves' pitching staff has compiled a 3.08 E.R.A., putting it in a league of its own. The next lowest E.R.A. in the majors is Boston's 3.76; in the N.L., it is Arizona's 3.86.</p>
        <p>In completing the design for this season's team, Schuerholz and Manager Bobby Cox decided to combine youth with experience at shortstop. With the 36-year-old Walt Weiss in place, they added Furcal, a 19-year-old Dominican, who had not played above the minor leagues' Class A.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the move has worked. With Cox dividing their playing time evenly, Weiss has a .447 on-base percentage, Furcal .392. It's just another cylinder that Schuerholz did not have to worry about as he sat in the jury room yesterday.</p>
