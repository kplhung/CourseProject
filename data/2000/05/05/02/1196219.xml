        <p>Forty years ago the iconic image of electronic music was a black-and-white photograph of stoop-shouldered, middle-aged men in suits and ties, standing together in university laboratories; behind them were synthesizers the size of walk-in freezers. Kevin Drumm's performance at Tonic on Thursday night served as an index of the music's evolution since then.</p>
        <p>The new electronic music artists don't hold university posts anymore; they're hungry freelancers. In a  duet of three pieces with the electronic percussionist Ikue Mori, Mr. Drumm, from Chicago, brought only low-key tools with him: a battered electric guitar laid flat on a tabletop, a couple of cheap effects pedals and a small upright synthesizer.</p>

        <p>Forty years ago the iconic image of electronic music was a black-and-white photograph of stoop-shouldered, middle-aged men in suits and ties, standing together in university laboratories; behind them were synthesizers the size of walk-in freezers. Kevin Drumm's performance at Tonic on Thursday night served as an index of the music's evolution since then.</p>
        <p>The new electronic music artists don't hold university posts anymore; they're hungry freelancers. In a  duet of three pieces with the electronic percussionist Ikue Mori, Mr. Drumm, from Chicago, brought only low-key tools with him: a battered electric guitar laid flat on a tabletop, a couple of cheap effects pedals and a small upright synthesizer.</p>
        <p>The guitar couldn't have fetched $100 at a pawnshop, but Mr. Drumm played it with sympathy, using its eccentricities. His music, entirely improvised, combines analog grime with digital beauty; he has not only made his instruments full extensions of his own will but learned how to roll them together almost as one entity.</p>
        <p>As he worked, moving his hands quickly, using his fingers as simultaneous levers on various parts of his gear, one often heard a sliver of fuzz guitar sliding into an elegant electronic thump, or spotless, echoing chime tones transforming into overdriven electric hum. It was all closely manipulated, even the hum. His guitar's pickup wasn't properly grounded, but instead of getting it fixed, Mr. Drumm has found ways to work those buzzes into the music. (He controls the errant sounds by placing fingers on parts of the guitar, like a doctor prodding a patient.)</p>
        <p>As Ms. Mori triggered tom-tom sounds from her own console and mixed the music, moving it between the speakers, Mr. Drumm often played his guitar without directly touching the strings. To make sounds, he lightly touched a screwdriver, a radio antenna and a nail clipper, which he had slid under the strings. None of it was comedic; you weren't hearing, per se, the sound of a nail clipper on guitar strings. He had his own ideas about ideal sounds that weren't connected to the physical world, and he was using homegrown ingenuity to get at them.</p>
