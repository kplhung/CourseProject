        <p>Circulation among the country's largest daily newspapers increased slightly during the fall and winter, helping slow the trend of declining circulation that has afflicted the industry for 16 years, according to the latest report from the Audit Bureau of Circulations.</p>
        <p>The report, covering the period from Oct. 1, 1999, through March 31, 2000, shows that USA Today, the nation's top-selling newspaper, still holds a 25,000-copy lead over The Wall Street Journal in daily circulation.</p>
        <p>Among the top 10 newspapers, 9 showed gains, with the circulation of the No. 3-ranked Los Angeles Times jumping by an eye-catching 5 percent, in part thanks to its new program of distributing the newspaper in partnership with Spanish- and Korean-language dailies in the Los Angeles area. The New York Times's daily circulation increased 1.29 percent.</p>
        <p>The Chicago Tribune's Monday-Friday circulation declined, pulled down by sharp decreases of the Monday and Tuesday editions. The Tribune's Wednesday-Friday numbers -- the ones it prefers to report -- increased.</p>
        <p>All New York area newspapers, including The Times, The Daily News, The New York Post, Newsday and The Newark Star-Ledger, showed circulation gains, with The Post rising 0.6 percent to 436,544, and The Star-Ledger increasing 0.25 percent to 406,569.</p>
        <p>While the latest daily circulation figures represented the closest thing the industry has seen to good news in recent years, Sunday circulation continued its steady decline, dropping 0.6 percent over all.</p>
