        <p>Perhaps it is best to think of Stephen L. Ruzow, the chairman and chief executive of the Pegasus Apparel Group, as Seventh Avenue's millennial Phil Spector. In talking to young designers he is trying to lure to Pegasus, the budding American fashion conglomerate, he has realized that it is easier to become a rock star today than it is to become a dressmaker with money enough to feed oneself and pay the rent.</p>
        <p>''You're talented and you go to Arista and they have the recording studios, the producers, the stylists, the whole infrastructure,'' he said, elaborating on the music business analogy. ''To be a fashion designer today, you're really on your own. There's no one to focus the talent.''</p>

        <p>Perhaps it is best to think of Stephen L. Ruzow, the chairman and chief executive of the Pegasus Apparel Group, as Seventh Avenue's millennial Phil Spector. In talking to young designers he is trying to lure to Pegasus, the budding American fashion conglomerate, he has realized that it is easier to become a rock star today than it is to become a dressmaker with money enough to feed oneself and pay the rent.</p>
        <p>''You're talented and you go to Arista and they have the recording studios, the producers, the stylists, the whole infrastructure,'' he said, elaborating on the music business analogy. ''To be a fashion designer today, you're really on your own. There's no one to focus the talent.''</p>
        <p>The purpose of Pegasus, Mr. Ruzow said, is to provide that focus, expanding American fashion brands by acquiring controlling interests in them. Mr. Ruzow, 56, joined the growing group in March and has likened it to the Gucci Group, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and other luxury empires.</p>
        <p>In a matter of weeks, Pegasus has acquired controlling interests in Pamela Dennis evening wear; Daryl K, the hip, jeans-heavy line designed by Daryl Kerrigan; and the famously underfinanced East Villager Miguel Adrover, who has been seized upon as American fashion's bright hope. Mr. Ruzow, who is operating with between $75 and $100 million from Pegasus Capital Advisors, a private equity fund in Greenwich, Conn., has also been in serious talks with Cynthia Rowley, whom he said he expects to sign before July, and John Bartlett, who recently left the Italian Genny group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruzow said he was particularly impressed with the fact that retailers placed orders for Mr. Adrover's fall 2000 clothes without even knowing the prices. Although he stressed that it wasn't buzz alone that made him compete for Mr. Adrover's talents, it's clear that Pegasus needs this young designer's  cachet. By describing itself as a burgeoning luxury empire, Pegasus has led fashion editors and other industry experts to ask how one can build a prestigious empire without first-tier names, the Tom Fords and the John Gallianos.  At least one designer approached by Pegasus, but who with an eye to the future asked not to be named, has indicated some ambivalence  about a group perceived in these rarefied circles as too unfocused.</p>
        <p>The fashion publicist Harriet Weintraub said, ''Right now it looks a little weak to me, this mix of brands.''</p>
        <p>Pamela Dennis, who has struggled to keep her gown business afloat for years, dresses celebrities like Halle Berry but is regularly ignored by the fashion press. Cynthia Rowley is already a successful brand in her own right, with five company-owned stores, 40 other stores owned by licensees in Asia and 15 licenses for goods including eyewear and cosmetics -- but her image is more commercial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruzow defended his acquisitions, arguing that Pamela Dennis gowns are generally the No. 1 or No. 2 selling gowns in department stores that carry them. An American fashion company, he said, must accept that ''there is no American Chanel, there is no American Hermes,'' adding, ''I don't think the three companies we've bought would hinder anyone else we want to buy.''</p>
        <p>Stephen C. Elkin, former chairman of Bergdorf Goodman, now chief executive of Fashion 500, an Internet fashion company, said: ''I don't think they're going to be the next LVMH. John Bartlett is never going to be a competitor to Gucci or Armani.'' But he said the brands had expansion potential and formed ''a nice nucleus to begin with.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruzow may wish he had never made the analogy to a European luxury empire. From his temporary office in Pamela Dennis's showroom at 550 Seventh Avenue last week, he said there were no boundaries in terms of the sorts of businesses he would consider buying. ''If we found a company that was the biggest supplier of something to Wal-Mart, we'd consider it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rowley said, ''I think they have to stop calling it a mini LVMH,'' adding that it left the group open to the criticism of failing to be something it isn't trying to be.</p>
        <p>It's clear that Pegasus is casting a wide net. Despite its American emphasis, Mr. Ruzow revealed that he is also trying to acquire ''a 150-year-old French house.'' That business, according to sources familiar with the discussions, is the 86-year-old house of Lanvin.</p>
        <p>As for the immediate future of Pegasus, Mr. Ruzow said that after signing Ms. Rowley he hoped to add a beauty company, but he would not name it. That leaves open the John Bartlett question. ''We are nowhere near making a deal with Pegasus,'' Nickelson Wooster, Mr. Bartlett's business partner said yesterday.</p>
