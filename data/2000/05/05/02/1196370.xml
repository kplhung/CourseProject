        <p>The Bergen County sheriff blocked construction at the new county jail today, saying he would not allow work to resume until county officials explained why the project was over budget and running late. County officials countered that the sheriff was waging a misleading, partisan battle to divert attention from what they called his own poor performance.</p>
        <p>The sheriff, Joseph L. Ciccone, a Democrat, held a news conference in a vacant cell block of the new jail on River Road to cite an analysis published last month by The Record of Hackensack, which asserted that the projected cost of the project was $16 million over budget, after an initial estimate of $45 million.</p>
        <p>Sheriff Ciccone, who unseated the Republican incumbent for sheriff in November 1998, said that the county executive, William P. Schuber; the county administrator, Charles A. Nurnberger; and the Republican-dominated Board of Freeholders had ignored his requests for information on the overruns.</p>
        <p>''Sixteen million dollars over the original price tag,'' Mr. Ciccone said. ''If that happened in the private sector, someone would be fired.''</p>
        <p>The first phase of construction was completed in March, and last month more than 600 inmates were moved into the new building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ciccone said he would not allow the start of construction on the project's second phase -- adding administrative space to the new building and renovating part of the old jail for 300 more beds -- because it involves the same project manager, the Gilbane Construction Company of Mercerville, N.J. And with 150 beds now vacant in the new jail, Sheriff Ciccone said he also questioned whether the work on the old jail was necessary.</p>
        <p>County officials acknowledged there had been delays, but added that the sheriff's cost figures were all wrong. Officials said an architect estimated that the project would cost the county $45 million, but that was in 1993, three years before the project was sent out for bids. The estimate also failed to include the expense of hiring a construction manager, which cost $4.3 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nurnberger said the actual initial cost was more like $53 million, including the cost of the project manager, by the time bids were solicited in 1996. Inflation had increased the cost as the county fought and won a lawsuit brought by the City of Hackensack in 1993 seeking to prevent the jail from being constructed on the site, which is along the Passaic River. There were also change orders totaling $2.7 million, making the total cost to the county about $56 million, Mr. Nurnberger said.</p>
        <p>Scott Chilcote, Gilbane's project executive, confirmed that the first phase was completed 11 months late. He said the delays included the discovery of huge concrete slabs buried deep underground that had been part of a defunct sewage treatment plant.</p>
        <p>''Every time you put a shovel in the ground, you don't know what you're going to find,'' Mr. Chilcote said.</p>
        <p>Anthony Cassano, the chairman of the seven-member Board of Freeholders, said the sheriff was trying to divert attention from his own problems.</p>
        <p>''It's a smoke screen,'' Mr. Cassano said. ''His performance has been incredibly lackluster.''</p>
        <p>He cited three escapes from the old jail this year. He also said the sheriff had already exhausted his overtime budget for the year.</p>
        <p>The number of beds, Mr. Cassano said, had been dictated by a court order stemming from a 1990 lawsuit by the state public advocate seeking to ease crowding at the old jail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cassano said the county was seeking a court injunction to allow the work to continue. Judge Sybil R. Moses of the State Superior Court is to meet with both sides on Tuesday in her chambers at the Bergen County Courthouse.</p>
