        <p>North America's second-largest funeral company, Loewen Group of Burnaby, British Columbia, reported higher first-quarter profit and said it had made some progress on a plan to emerge from bankruptcy. Profit for the latest quarter was $22.8 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with $6.9 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue dropped 16 percent, to $256.9 million, because of lower prices for funerals and the sale of 124 cemeteries. Loewen was given protection from about 9,000 creditors in June.</p>
