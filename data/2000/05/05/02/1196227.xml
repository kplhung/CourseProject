        <p>Twyla Tharp's ''Beethoven Seventh'' is not a ballet that simply washes over the viewer. It requires its audience to think and its dancers to dare to luxuriate in full-body physicality. The two vocabularies of classical ballet and Ms. Tharp's squiggly modernism seldom merge in the ballet, performed by the New York City Ballet on Saturday afternoon at the New York State Theater. But they cohabit revealingly, giving the performers a newly burnished glow.</p>
        <p>Peter Boal is a marvel of clarity in the first movement, offering a primer on what is to come as he slips from one idiom to another with unhesitating elegance. His partner Jenifer Ringer adds spice to the beauty of Mr. Boal's dancing, an imp whose wry humor suggests the nuttiness of dancing to the august Beethoven symphony.</p>

        <p>Twyla Tharp's ''Beethoven Seventh'' is not a ballet that simply washes over the viewer. It requires its audience to think and its dancers to dare to luxuriate in full-body physicality. The two vocabularies of classical ballet and Ms. Tharp's squiggly modernism seldom merge in the ballet, performed by the New York City Ballet on Saturday afternoon at the New York State Theater. But they cohabit revealingly, giving the performers a newly burnished glow.</p>
        <p>Peter Boal is a marvel of clarity in the first movement, offering a primer on what is to come as he slips from one idiom to another with unhesitating elegance. His partner Jenifer Ringer adds spice to the beauty of Mr. Boal's dancing, an imp whose wry humor suggests the nuttiness of dancing to the august Beethoven symphony.</p>
        <p>The music and ballet turn mysterious in the second movement, giving Wendy Whelan and Nikolaj Hubbe one of the strangest and most beautiful pas de deux of their repertories. With his blond hair and bare chest, white flames in white light, Mr. Hubbe is extraordinary in the precise articulations of his upper body. Ms. Whelan is simultaneously lush and sharply focused, authoritative and melting.</p>
        <p>The music overwhelms the ballet in the end. Damian Woetzel does his mercurial projectile thing as brilliantly as ever in the third movement. Miranda Weese lurks and blossoms wittily. But too often Ms. Tharp descends to the relentless jokiness of bad Jerome Robbins here and in the fourth movement, which brings back the entire cast for an appropriately grand yet hectic finale. George Cleve was the guest conductor.</p>
        <p>Robbins's ''In the Night,'' choreographed in 1970 and set to piano music by Chopin, was once a ballet about three pairs of characters and, perhaps, three stages in romantic love. But the ballet is just as persuasive when performed as it was on Saturday as nearly plotless choreography. The coda, in which the three couples meet briefly and part, was suddenly a thing of haunted stillness.</p>
        <p>Rachel Rutherford and Arch Higgins were the exquisitely lyrical first pair, two perfectly matched bodies in one long, unfolding silken strand of dance. The second pas de deux suggested a cool and distant perfection embodied by Maria Kowroski and Philip Neal, her discreet partner. Ms. Ringer and James Fayette swept through the third pas de deux like unstoppable wind.</p>
        <p>The program was completed by  Balanchine's ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux'' and ''Western Symphony.'' Abi Stafford was her usual confident self in a role debut in the demanding Tchaikovsky piece, though it would be nice to see a little of her youth shine through. Nilas Martins, also making a role debut, limped through bravely after an injury.</p>
