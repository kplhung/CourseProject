        <p>The state attorney general's office asked a state judge yesterday to reconsider his decision to name a Manhattan lawyer as the general counsel for the Cypress Hills Cemetery just two months after he was fired from another position overseeing the cemetery's troubled affairs.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, Ravi Batra, had reasserted himself ''in a backdoor way'' into the cemetery case by winning an appointment as the graveyard's general counsel after being removed as its temporary receiver, said Scott Brown, a spokesman for the attorney general, Eliot L.

        <p>The state attorney general's office asked a state judge yesterday to reconsider his decision to name a Manhattan lawyer as the general counsel for the Cypress Hills Cemetery just two months after he was fired from another position overseeing the cemetery's troubled affairs.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, Ravi Batra, had reasserted himself ''in a backdoor way'' into the cemetery case by winning an appointment as the graveyard's general counsel after being removed as its temporary receiver, said Scott Brown, a spokesman for the attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer. ''We were shocked, surprised and disappointed by these actions,'' Mr. Brown added. ''And we are going to vigorously fight Mr. Batra's new appointment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Batra has a long history of involvement with Cypress Hills, which was placed in the hands of a court-appointed receiver after it was sued by the state in 1993 for financial mismanagement and for burying nearly 1,000 bodies in a 40-foot mound of construction debris.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Batra was installed as a receiver by Justice Richard D. Huttner of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn and oversaw the cemetery's finances until Feb. 28, when Justice Huttner dismissed him after state officials contended that Mr. Batra had ''undermined the public's confidence'' by mishandling the case.</p>
        <p>According to state officials, the problem with Mr. Batra was that, as receiver, he had become embroiled in a nasty public dispute with two of his own lawyers, Arnold J. Ludwig and Thomas J. Garry, who have longstanding ties to the Brooklyn Democratic Party. The dispute ''jeopardized the stability of the cemetery at the very moment when stability was most needed,'' the attorney general's office said in court papers filed yesterday.</p>
        <p>In a bitter letter that was circulated in Brooklyn political circles, Mr. Ludwig and Mr. Garry complained that Mr. Batra had fired them as legal advisers on the Cypress Hills case despite their ''unwavering loyalty'' to the party for more than 25 years. The letter, which hinted that party allegiance and legal appointments in the Brooklyn court system went hand in hand, sparked a federal investigation that is continuing.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Batra was ousted, a new receiver, Douglas Rosenberg, was appointed by Justice Huttner. And in the court papers filed yesterday, the attorney general's office charged that the judge had flatly contradicted himself by dismissing Mr. Batra in February, then putting him back on the case in April, albeit it in a different position.</p>
        <p>''The general counsel appointment,'' the attorney general's office wrote, is ''troubling because it creates an opportunity for Mr. Batra to reassert control of the cemetery, effectively rendering meaningless this court's order making Mr. Rosenberg temporary receiver.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenberg could not be reached for comment yesterday. But in the same papers, the attorney general's office said Mr. Batra had been appointed against Mr. Rosenberg's will.</p>
        <p>Mr. Batra refused to comment other than to say, ''It is a pending matter for the court to resolve.''</p>
