        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a fourth-year medical student with $67,000 in school loans and three years of training left before I am fully licensed, I can appreciate the resentment that many physicians feel when it is suggested that nurse practitioners and doctors, despite the differences in the cost and extent of their training, provide statistically identical care (''Like a Doctor's Office, With a Little More Time'').</p>
        <p>If a large, randomized clinical trial to follow up on the results of the Columbia study is not feasible, perhaps the concern that nurse practitioners lack adequate training in the medical management of complicated patients might be addressed on a practitioner-by-practitioner basis.</p>

        <p>Primary care providers who intend to practice independently -- nurse practitioners and physicians alike -- could be required to pass a commonly agreed upon oral and written board exam.</p>
        <p>A standardized licensing process might ensure that the nurse practitioners had a fund of medical knowledge similar to that of the physicians.</p>
