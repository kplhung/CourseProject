        <p>A rock that fell in northwest Canada in January may preserve a bit of the primordial solar system, little changed from what it was 4.5 billion years ago. During the early morning hours of Jan. 18, a fireball exploded over the Yukon: a meteor from outer space burning up in the Earth's atmosphere, with sonic booms heard in Alaska and British Columbia.</p>
        <p>Not all of the meteor burned up, though. A local resident collected about two pounds of fragments, which resemble burnt charcoal briquettes, placed them in plastic bags and stored them in a freezer. Although the fiery journey through the atmosphere heated up the outside of the surviving rocks, the inside would have remained cold, giving researchers hope that delicate organic molecules trapped within the meteorite remained intact.</p>
        <p>The meteorite turns out to be a type known as carbonaceous chondrites, which contain sizable quantities of carbon and organic molecules. Carbonaceous chondrites are rare -- only about one in 50 meteorites found on Earth is a carbonaceous chondrite -- because they burn up easily, and pieces that survive re-entry weather away quickly. It has been 31 years since a carbonaceous chondrite has been recovered soon after its arrival, and never a frozen one.</p>
        <p>''This meteorite is our first chance ever to look at volatile organics,'' said Dr. Michael E. Zolensky, a cosmic mineralogist at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. About a pound of the fragments are on loan to NASA.</p>
        <p>''It's typically a lot of organics, including amino acids,'' Dr. Zolensky said. In addition, ''Probably there's water inside, we're betting.''</p>
        <p>Many scientists believe such meteorites seeded Earth with water and organic molecules, the building blocks of life.</p>
        <p>The original meteor was probably the size of a bus, Dr. Zolensky said, and probably spent most of the last 4.5 billion years orbiting at the outer part of the asteroid belt near Jupiter. Its chemical composition is likely to have changed little in that time.</p>
