        <p>The United States premiere of Louis Andriessen and Peter Greenaway's ''Writing to Vermeer,'' presented by Netherlands Opera, and the first New York appearance of the Bolshoi Ballet in 10 years are among the highlights of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, which is to run from July 11 to 30.</p>
        <p>Set in 1672, when the French overran the Netherlands and the so-called Dutch Golden Age came to an end, ''Writing to Vermeer'' imagines a series of letters addressed to the painter Vermeer from three women: his real mother-in-law, his wife, and a fictional model.</p>

        <p>The United States premiere of Louis Andriessen and Peter Greenaway's ''Writing to Vermeer,'' presented by Netherlands Opera, and the first New York appearance of the Bolshoi Ballet in 10 years are among the highlights of Lincoln Center Festival 2000, which is to run from July 11 to 30.</p>
        <p>Set in 1672, when the French overran the Netherlands and the so-called Dutch Golden Age came to an end, ''Writing to Vermeer'' imagines a series of letters addressed to the painter Vermeer from three women: his real mother-in-law, his wife, and a fictional model.</p>
        <p>With music by Mr. Andriessen, the Dutch composer, and libretto by Mr. Greenaway, the English director and visual artist, the opera juxtaposes the serene world of Vermeer's paintings with the turbulent events of the time. A retrospective of Mr. Greenaway's films is to be shown from July 5 to 12 at Makor, at 35 West 67th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In a celebration of Russian ballet and theater, the Bolshoi will perform two programs of works by 19th- and 20th-century Russian composers, including Vladimir Vasiliev's 1997 staging of ''Giselle.''</p>
        <p>The Maly Drama Theater of St. Petersburg will present the New York premiere of Lev Dodin's critically acclaimed staging of ''Brothers and Sisters,'' a two-part panoramic epic of life, love, hunger and betrayal in a Russian village in 1945, based on the trilogy of novels by Fyodor Abramov. The actress Julia Borisova will join the Vakhtangov Theater of Moscow in its United States debut with ''Innocent as Charged,'' Alexander Ostrovsky's play about a woman who loses her lover and her young son, only to be reunited with them 17 years later.</p>
        <p>The festival will pay tribute to the 20th-century French composer Oliver Messiaen (1908-92) with programs devoted to his electronic works; the 98-minute-long ''From the Canyons to the Stars,'' featuring Peter Serkin and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center in the longest work ever written for piano and chamber ensemble, and Messiaen's final work, ''Illuminations of the Beyond,'' a large-scale composition commissioned for the New York Philharmonic's 150th season in 1992.</p>
        <p>Following its tradition of honoring an American composer each year, the festival will pay tribute to Meredith Monk with a three-part retrospective of her music, including rare performances of seminal early works from the 1970's with those from the 80's and 90's.</p>
        <p>Other events are to include the New York debut of Les Colporteurs, a French nouveau-cirque company; two five-part series devoted to music from the Caribbean and electronic music; and appearances by the Belgian choreographer Wim Vandekeybus and his company, Ultima Vez, the French choreographer Mathilde Monnier and her troupe, the Bill T. Jones/ Arnie Zane Dance Company, and the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater with a premiere by the artistic director, Judith Jamison.</p>
        <p>Lincoln Center Theater will be represented by ''Spinning Into Butter,'' Rebecca Gilman's comical look at political correctness at a small Vermont college. The New York Video Festival is to return for a fifth season with an appearance by George Kuchar, the underground video director.</p>
