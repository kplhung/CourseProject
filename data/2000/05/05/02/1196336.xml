        <p>Melanie Kloetzel has only been choreographing for a few years, and so one might attribute the frustrations of ''Serious Rock'' to her inexperience. But there were moments in the program of dance and live music presented on Friday night that suggested there was more to her work than was evident.</p>
        <p>One of those moments occurred in ''Shed,'' a duet for Julie Betts and Theresa Palazzo. Not only were the women wearing socks, a rare occurrence in dance, but the socks were an everyday brown, and one was removed and casually became a mitten. As striking was the processional of quick stage crosses for four women who passed one another with knowing glances in the opening minutes of ''Rock,'' set to rock music composed and performed by Ms. Kloetzel, Daniel Dick and Jason Hartley.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kloetzel's dancers, who also included Chalie Livingston and Ayla Yavin, are attractively spunky. Drawing on the loose cantilevering of contact improvisation, the choreography for some of the group passages was authoritative and not uninteresting. But the ideas behind Ms. Kloetzel's new ''Sweet Betty,'' performed to her own music, were indistinct. And ''Postpick,'' a new solo set to music by Jimi Hendrix, offered too long a look at Ms. Kloetzel stretching, flailing and indulging in birdlike quirkiness.</p>
