        <p>MAHONEY-David. It is with a painful sense of loss that the trustees, officers and staff of the Eleanor Naylor Dana Charitable Trust record the untimely death on Monday, May 1st, of the Trust's Chairman, David Mahoney. His singular experience as one of the country's most experienced foundation executives, his commitment to innovation and excellence in philanthropy, and his vision made his leadership one of achievement. His colleagues, and thousands of individuals and organizations who benefitted from his counsel and concern, have lost a rare mentor and friend. To his wife, Hildegarde Mahoney, his family and his many friends, we express our deepest sympathy. The Trustees and Officers, Eleanor Naylor Dana Charitable Trust</p>

        <p>MAHONEY-David. The HarvardMahoney Neuroscience Institute is saddened by the death of David Mahoney, a man who was both a visionary and a leader.

Albert, Ph.D., Director Harvard-Mahoney Neuroscience Institute Harvard Medical School</p>
