        <p>Millions of television viewers found themselves without access to ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and many other popular television programs yesterday as a battle between the country's two biggest media companies, Time Warner and Walt Disney, became a bitter public confrontation.</p>
        <p>The dispute involves how much Time Warner should pay Disney for carrying its cable channels. But it also touches on larger issues dealing with the distribution of news and entertainment programming, including the longstanding antipathy between the cable and broadcast industry, the growing competition between cable and satellite companies and Disney's opposition to the proposed merger between America Online and Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Time Warner Cable removed ABC stations from cable systems it operates in seven cities serving 3.5 million homes, including New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia, at 12:01 a.m. yesterday. The move came in the midst of one of television's most competitive ratings periods, a sweeps month, when networks and stations always trot out their most expensive shows. Disney had offered a 24-day extension on its negotiations over the cable payments.</p>
        <p>ABC, which is owned by Disney, yesterday asked the Federal Communications Commission to force Time Warner to restore the programming. A commission spokesman, David Fiske, said the commission expected a response from Time Warner by the close of business today and ''will expedite a decision.''</p>
        <p>ABC is basing its request on a vague clause about sweeps month actions in the 1992 Cable Act. In a statement yesterday the commission encouraged the companies to resolve the issue privately.</p>
        <p>There are currently no talks between Disney and Time Warner.</p>
        <p>Both sides acknowledged they could be damaged by the impasse. Disney stands to lose advertising revenue and the opportunity to show its most anticipated programming, including the Kentucky Derby this weekend and the season finale of many of its series. Time Warner risks alienating its customers at a time when satellite distribution is growing and giving fodder to those who are arguing in Washington that the America Online-Time Warner merger would concentrate too much power in one company.</p>
        <p>Even the extension issue involved the merger, with Time Warner demanding a bargaining deadline for eight months from now -- presumably after federal regulators had already acted on the AOL deal. Disney had wanted the shorter 24-day extension, presumably to retain the merger issue as leverage in the talks.</p>
        <p>Both sides worked furiously yesterday to present their case to the public. On the channels where it had been carrying ABC, Time Warner posted the message, ''Disney has taken ABC away from you.'' A Time Warner spokesman said the company was under legal obligation to pull ABC's signals because no agreement was in place and Disney had failed to negotiate seriously.</p>
        <p>But Preston Padden, the executive vice president for governmental relations at Disney, said, ''They're liars and monopolists.'' Robert A. Iger, the president of Disney, said: ''They told consumers a blatant lie in saying we pulled the plug. The last time I checked they were responsible to local authorization for their franchises.''</p>
        <p>Time Warner charged that Disney was trying to increase earnings by extracting hundreds of millions of dollars in what are known as retransmission consent negotiations. Broadcast stations have the right to seek compensation from cable systems for the right to retransmit their signals on cable channels.</p>
        <p>Time Warner executives said they were close to a deal with Disney in December that would have turned the Disney cable channel from a premium service to a basic channel, as well as adding two other Disney cable channels, the Soap Channel and Disney Toon, to Time Warner's cable systems.</p>
        <p>Although the two sides disagree on the payment terms of that deal, both agree that after the merger with AOL was announced in January Disney backed off, saying the situation had changed. Disney argued that it was concerned about maintaining free access to opportunities created by the convergence of television with the Internet, which Time Warner and AOL hope to explore. Time Warner calls this a negotiating ploy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Padden, Disney's chief lobbyist, said the company was worried specifically about being blocked from utilizing interactive features like commercials with links to the Internet and digital TV that could allow viewers to purchase goods.</p>
        <p>Soon after, Disney executives began to aggressively lobby Congress against the proposed merger.</p>
        <p>In March, Disney infuriated Time Warner by offering cable subscribers in Houston a $99 rebate on a satellite dish when the two sides were facing a deadline in that city. More than 15,000 people took Disney up on the offer, which Time Warner said was a threat to its business.</p>
        <p>The differences about the negotiations extended to virtually every detail of the discussions. Fred Dressler, the senior vice president of Time Warner and the chief negotiator with ABC, said that Disney's new demands added a total of $300 million to the 10-year agreement the two companies already had in place. Mr. Iger, the president of Disney, called the $300 million figure ''totally preposterous.''</p>
        <p>The loss of ABC's programs in about 3.5 million homes -- a small percentage of the 100 million homes with television sets -- may not drastically affect the overall ratings for the sweeps programs, but advertisers will expect ABC to make up for whatever shortfalls are experienced by granting them free future commercials.</p>
        <p>''If you buy network television and all of a sudden your schedule is not delivering the kind of audiences you're expecting, then it's a concern,'' said Bill Cella, the director for broadcast programming for Universal McCann, an advertising agency. Two senior media industry executives said ABC could expect to lose $2 million to $3 million a day worth of  commercials it would later have to offer free.</p>
        <p>In New York at least, ABC got backing from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who attacked Time Warner as a predatory monopoly. ''This is an example of what happens when you let a monopoly get too big,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''It has a particularly bad effect in New York City because we're a city in which, given the high buildings, the idea of going out and getting an antenna is stupid.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, viewers either needed to switch to an old-fashioned antenna or sign up for satellite delivery to receive ABC's programs in the cities affected. Time Warner began a program of compensating customers $15 for the cost of a switch that would allow viewing through an antenna.</p>
        <p>Disney spokesmen would not discuss the level of involvement of Michael D. Eisner, the company's chairman, but Mr. Dressler of Time Warner said all the Disney negotiators had said that ''Michael Eisner is calling the shots on this and he's not going to take the deal we had in December.'' He said the negotiating tactics were ''pure Eisner,'' adding, ''This is Disney looking to increase revenues to help its stock price.''</p>
        <p>Time Warner executives said their own senior managers, including the chairman, Gerald M. Levin, were extremely involved in the decision to refuse Disney's extension offer. But Mr. Iger said that assigning the dispute to a confrontation between the management of the two companies was totally inaccurate. ''In no way is this about testosterone, or a personal showdown,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Compensation for programming has been an issue in numerous confrontations between broadcasters and cable companies in the past. Until the 1992 Cable Act, cable systems could carry broadcast stations without offering compensation. At that time, broadcasters won the right to negotiate with cable companies for some kind of compensation. CBS led a move to force cable operators to pay subscriber fees to network stations, just as cable operators do to other programmers, like Lifetime or the Arts and Entertainment Network. That move failed when the other networks, led, as it happened, by ABC, opted -- instead of getting cash -- to increase distribution for cable channels they owned. ABC won carriage for ESPN2.</p>
        <p>Broadcast stations have rarely been pulled off cable systems. News Corporation, the parent of the Fox network, pulled its stations off systems owned by Cox Cable late last year in a dispute over terms of carriage of sports and movie channels owned by Fox. The matter was settled in five days. An independent station in Portland, Me., pulled its signal from a Time Warner cable system in 1993, seeking cash for retransmission consent. That dispute lasted one day.</p>
        <p>Time Warner said it had not met with similar opposition in its more recent retransmission deals with the other broadcast networks. In late December it concluded a long-term deal with the News Corporation, which involved carriage of news sports and movie channels. Time Warner had a deal in effect with CBS until 2003 and one with NBC until 2007.</p>
        <p>Time Warner has reached agreement with Fox and CBS to carry new features and stations that can be created as a result of digital technology in the coming years. NBC is still negotiating.</p>
        <p>Executives from Fox, NBC and CBS declined to comment on the Disney-Time Warner dispute.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 3, 2000, Wednesday  A front-page article yesterday about the decision by Time Warner Cable to remove ABC stations from cable systems in seven cities misstated the basis of ABC's move for redress from the Federal Communications Commission. It was a 1993 commission regulation, not a clause in the 1992 Cable Act.</p>
