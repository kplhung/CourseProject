        <p>The Parliament failed today for a second time to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to elect the reformist candidate for president who is favored by party leaders.</p>
        <p>The chosen candidate, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, finished far ahead of other candidates, with 314 votes. The next ballot is scheduled for Friday, and in that round just a simple majority of 276 will be necessary.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Sezer is supported by the leaders of all five parties represented in Parliament, including Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's organization, he has been considered a shoo-in for election. Many Turks who are campaigning for a more open political system hope that he will win, and they remained optimistic after the vote today.</p>
        <p>''People who support him are confident,'' said Orhan Erisen, an executive who works with grass-roots  groups. ''He's going to win.''</p>
        <p>But although Mr. Sezer, who is the chief justice of the highest court, remains the heavy favorite, influential figures with various motives are reportedly conspiring quietly against him. Several newspapers have reported that military commanders, who wield considerable power, are less than thrilled with Mr. Sezer's candidacy. He has advocated the repeal of laws that limit freedom of speech, and senior officers have said in the past that those laws are necessary to prevent Turks from advocating separatism, religious fundamentalism or other subversive causes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sezer has also asserted that the decisions of every government agency, without exception, should be subject to judicial review. The military regularly cashiers officers whom it considers sympathetic to fundamentalism, and it denies them the right to appeal. Military commanders have not publicly expressed opposition to Mr. Sezer. One newspaper reported today that they were making no visible efforts to block him because they considered it ''quite impossible'' that he could turn his ideas into law.</p>
        <p>Another reported center of behind-the-scenes opposition to Mr. Sezer is the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party. Its leading figure, former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, is said to have told his friends in Parliament that he dislikes Mr. Sezer because in a court case in which he was a witness, Mr. Sezer refused to order a recess for prayer. Some Parliament members consider Mr. Sezer too liberal. Others may resent his role in decisions that invalidated laws drafted to give them lucrative pensions. Still others apparently hope to promote members of their own parties rather than vote for a lifelong independent like Mr. Sezer.</p>
        <p>Parliament may cast only four ballots in the race, with a simple majority being enough to elect a candidate in the third or fourth round. If no candidate wins a majority after four rounds, Parliament is dissolved and new elections are called. Members are thought to want to avoid that at all costs. If no candidate wins a majority on Friday, one is expected to be chosen on the fourth ballot.</p>
        <p>In a fourth ballot, only the candidates who finished first and second in the third ballot would be allowed to compete. Mr. Sezer could find himself facing the speaker of Parliament, Yildirim Akbulut, who finished a distant second in the balloting today with 88 votes.</p>
