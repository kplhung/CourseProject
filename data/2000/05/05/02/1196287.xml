        <p>Measured on a per-vote basis, it was probably one of the more expensive lobbying efforts ever undertaken by the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Hoping to sway legislators who remain undecided on whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations in a vote set for this month, President Clinton set aside money earlier this year to fly wavering lawmakers to China where they could gauge trade and human rights conditions for themselves.</p>
        <p>But, in the end, only two undecided congressmen showed up.</p>
        <p>Two trips had originally been proposed, one led by Commerce Secretary William Daley and another by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman. But these quickly became political no-flight zones for politicians worried about coming under attack by organized labor lobbyists who argue that permanent trade status would erode human rights in China and cost American jobs.</p>
        <p>So Secretary Daley's trip, which was to have included a dozen legislators, was ''consolidated'' with that of Secretary Glickman's. And when Mr.  Glickman lifted off last week from Andrews Air Force Base in a C32-A, the Air Force version of the civilian Boeing 757, he had only two undecided congressmen in tow -- and administration officials were refusing to identify them until the flight had left, lest they be pressured at the last minute to drop out.</p>
        <p>And so began the education of Representative Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat, and Representative Ruben Hinojosa, a Texas Democrat, neither of whom had been to China before. They were treated royally in Beijing, where they met with a deputy prime minister and watched the sun rise over the Great Wall.</p>
        <p>In Shanghai, they had a private audience with China's chief negotiator with Taiwan. And in Hong Kong, they met with the chief executive of China's newly reclaimed territory and dined with its business elite at the exclusive China Club.</p>
        <p>About a dozen administration officials accompanied them, as well as two congressmen who support making China's trade status permanent, Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, and Norman Dicks, a Washington Democrat. And dozens more people chaperoned the men from place to place on the ground.</p>
        <p>Congressmen Meeks and Hinojosa seemed bemused by so much attention, sometimes falling behind the throng that moved through a program meant to show them how much the United States would lose if it did not grant China the permanent trade status. China's favorable status has been subject to annual review by Congress since the suppression of pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, though it has always been approved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meeks appeared particularly suspicious of the over-orchestrated show, and skipped a supermarket visit in Shanghai in order to meet with common folk. With a consular official translating at his side, Mr. Meeks trudged up the stairs of a middle-class apartment block and along the dirt paths of a migrant worker neighborhood in his gray summer suit, addressing startled Chinese along the way with his big American hello.</p>
        <p>''Do you like China?'' he asked a young migrant from Anhui province who invited him into her barren, whitewashed room.</p>
        <p>''Of course, I do,'' she replied, ''I'm Chinese!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Meeks questioned everyone he met about human rights (''I've never had any trouble,'' one elderly man replied in a typical exchange) and what they thought about China joining the World Trade Organization (''Well, of course you should support it; we want to compete with the rest of the world,'' said Cui Qian, a middle-aged businesswoman).</p>
        <p>Between stops, he fought to reconcile what he had heard from the labor unions in Washington with what he saw in China. He detected none of the repression or exploitation so often talked about.</p>
        <p>''The Chinese seem to think that economics are more important to them than whatever form of government they have right now,'' he concluded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meeks was uncertain what advantage labor unions could expect if Congress does not grant China permanent trade status when it votes on the measure later this month. ''That's something I'll have to ask them,'' Mr. Meeks said, noting that the issue is muddled even in his own district, the borough of Queens.</p>
        <p>United Parcel Service, which has a large operation at Kennedy International Airport, supports permanent trade status and China's membership in the World Trade Organization because the company is lobbying for a cargo route to China. The Teamsters support the company in that bid, which would create union jobs, but are nonetheless lobbying against permanent normal trade relations, or P.N.T.R.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meeks and Mr. Hinojosa watched workers unload sacks of American soybeans from barges in Shanghai. China is the biggest buyer of American soybeans and is importing $700 million worth of them in the current season.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of demand for imported soybeans in China and if we don't give them P.N.T.R. that demand will go to the Argentineans or the Brazilians,'' said Philip Laney, who represents the American Soybean Association in China and was on hand to lobby the congressmen.</p>
        <p>China has said it will apply to enter the World Trade Organization regardless of the Congressional vote, and the United States is unlikely to stand in its way -- in part because such a move would infuriate Taiwan whose membership is being held up until China joins.</p>
        <p>China's entry does not require the support of Congress. And although President Clinton promised China during the negotiations that the annual Congressional review of its trade status would end, a Geneva-based trade official said, ''China can come in regardless of what Congress votes, provided that the U.S. representatives in the General Council and the Working Party approve the conditions, along with the other member governments.''</p>
        <p>While no one is sure exactly what would happen if Congress votes against permanent normal trade relations, China could join and then invoke Article XIII of the Marrakesh Agreement that established the trade organization, allowing Beijing to withhold from the United States commitments it makes to other organization members.</p>
        <p>''If the United States misses this opportunity it will actually lose the tremendous market of China and will be giving away the opportunity for participating in this market to its competitors,'' China's trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, said last month. ''In that case, the United States, especially U.S. companies, will suffer the most.''</p>
        <p>That has many American business people in China worried.</p>
        <p>''China's government has no qualms about rewarding political cooperation with economic opportunity,'' said Jeffrey Bernstein, founder of Emerge Logistics, which handles distribution of foreign products on the mainland, an industry likely to open most dramatically to foreign participation if China joins the trade organization.</p>
        <p>''Jeopardizing American companies' natural advantage in distributing products provides a wonderful opportunity for our European, Asia and Australian friends,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Larry Wortzel, director of the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center says more than 200,000 American jobs are directly related to China trade.</p>
        <p>The House of Representatives will vote on China's trade status during the week of May 22. Legislators familiar with the vote say it is still 10 to 15 votes short of passage.</p>
        <p>The White House has been working with Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, on ''parallel legislation'' that would set up a watchdog Congressional commission to review Chinese trade and human rights policies and perhaps recommend sanctions against Beijing within the limits of organization rules.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meeks and Mr. Hinojosa, for their part, remained undecided as they headed home this weekend.</p>
        <p>''You do get a different feel once you have been here,'' Mr. Meeks said. ''Theory and practice are two different things.''</p>
