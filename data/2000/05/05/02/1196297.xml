        <p>The Ku Klux Klan, which created a furor when a handful of its members demonstrated in lower Manhattan last year, plans to reapply for a permit to demonstrate again this fall, the group's lawyer has said.</p>
        <p>In last year's rally, Klan members were forced to remove their masks as a result of a 155-year-old New York state law that forbids demonstrators to cover their faces. City officials invoked the law after the Klan applied for a permit.</p>
        <p>The group challenged the order that the masks be removed, which was overturned by a federal District Court judge, but then reinstated by a federal appeals court. The case is now back in district court.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, said the group intended to again ask the court to allow the demonstrators to wear masks.</p>
        <p>''They used this statute as a pretext for denying the Klan the right to effectively demonstrate,'' said the lawyer, Norman Siegel, executive director of the civil liberties group. ''Once they could not wear their masks it substantially decreased the number of people who would demonstrate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Siegel said the group planned to reapply for the permit, and this time would ask a judge to permanently bar the city from enforcing the ordinance. ''The Klan intends to come back and exercise their right to wear the hood and the mask,'' he said.</p>
        <p>City officials said they were merely enforcing an existing law, which prevents organized groups from demonstrating while wearing masks. The law dates back to the mid-19th century, when tenant farmers demonstrated against their landlords. Wearing disguises, the farmers would stage protests, and sometimes riots, and escape to the countryside.</p>
        <p>''The reasons behind the statute are as valid today as they were when the law was passed, and that is to create accountability for one's actions when one is in a crowd,'' said Daniel S. Connolly, a lawyer for the city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Connolly said courts have recognized that governments have a right to set certain regulations for when and how people can demonstrate. He said that the government could not pass a law banning a particular group from conducting masked demonstrations, but that the New York law applies to all groups. The law is not applied based on a group's position, but is intended to prevent criminal behavior.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Siegel said the Constitution recognized the right to criticize the government anonymously. Typically, he said, groups that are denied the right are ''fringe groups or pariah groups.'' He said the city has applied the law selectively.</p>
        <p>''The Klan issue is a test case with regard to anonymous speech,'' he said. ''Can the government require people to identify themselves when they stand on the courthouse steps to criticize government policies?''</p>
        <p>In its decision last year, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found for the city, which said that it had not selectively applied the law because it enforced it for all demonstrations, not just the Klan rally. The court also echoed the District Court's findings that the police had not based enforcement of the law on the content of the Klan's speech, which would have been unconstitutional.</p>
