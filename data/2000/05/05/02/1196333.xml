        <p>Rebecca Kelly Ballet  Kaye Playhouse</p>
        <p>Rebecca Kelly Ballet celebrated its 20th anniversary on Saturday afternoon, and the festive occasion surely inspired Ms. Kelly's genial new ''Telemann,'' danced to some recorded music by the 18th-century composer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kelly choreographed neat patterns. Yet just as Telemann adorned his compositional structures with whimsies, so Ms. Kelly mixed formality with fun by having dancers bow at one moment, then frisk and wiggle immediately thereafter.</p>
        <p>A pas de deux emphasized Cynthia Sheppard's fragility and Gregory King's sturdiness, and there were celebratory sequences of banner waving.</p>
        <p>Two older pieces displayed lyrical and dramatic aspects of Ms. Kelly's choreography. In ''Soft Moon,'' from 1994, Christine McMillan was a moon goddess who bewitched three men (Alexander Forsythe, Ron Spiess and Daniel Wilkins).</p>
        <p>Although the ballet had serene and tempestuous episodes, it was never quite varied enough. Bruce Wolosoff's score for violin and piano abounded with striking shifts of mood and intensity, but the choreography too often involved little more than shifts of position.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kelly bravely confronted a major social problem in ''Dream Driven,'' a work about alcoholism choreographed in 1985. Julie Hebb, Elizabeth Belton, Danielle Tinsley, Ms. Sheppard and Ms. McMillan symbolized aspects of a woman who becomes an alcoholic because of the pressures of her professional and personal life.</p>
        <p>The action hurtled along to Stravinsky's two-piano arrangement of his ''Rite of Spring.'' Yet because the characters never became believable people, the choreography seemed merely an anthology of twitches, staggers, automatonlike marchings and desperate clutchings at pillows, glasses and liquor bottles.</p>
