        <p>In a shift that could mean month-by-month fluctuations and higher energy costs for Consolidated Edison's customers in New York, the state lifted rules yesterday regulating about 30 percent of the average electricity bill, officials said.</p>
        <p>The change was a step in a three-year drive to eliminate many of the monopoly-era pricing regulations governing the state's electricity industry, and to help Con Ed ease into a more competitive market. Con Ed provides electricity to about three million customers in New York City and Westchester County.</p>

        <p>In a shift that could mean month-by-month fluctuations and higher energy costs for Consolidated Edison's customers in New York, the state lifted rules yesterday regulating about 30 percent of the average electricity bill, officials said.</p>
        <p>The change was a step in a three-year drive to eliminate many of the monopoly-era pricing regulations governing the state's electricity industry, and to help Con Ed ease into a more competitive market. Con Ed provides electricity to about three million customers in New York City and Westchester County.</p>
        <p>David C. Flanagan, a spokesman for the State Public Service Commission, said customers would ''still have the regulated portion of the bill for transmission and distribution services, which comprises about 70 percent of the average bill,'' but that there would be ''a new portion of the bill that reflects market supply prices and other services.''</p>
        <p>The market prices will vary month to month, officials said, like gasoline and heating oil prices, which are based on supply and demand. The changes, for now, affect only Con Ed customers, but ''as we move through the transition to a competitive market, all power companies will offer market rate for their electricity,'' Mr. Flanagan said.</p>
