        <p>The rule has been on the books of the Kentucky Racing Commission for a long time, but it is being applied with peculiar impact for the 126th Kentucky Derby on Saturday.</p>
        <p>It reads, ''Horses entered in the same race and owned wholly or in part by the same owner or spouse shall be joined as a mutuel entry and single betting interest.'' And the rules go on to say that ''a wager on one horse in a mutuel entry shall be a wager on all horses in the same mutuel entry.''</p>

        <p>The rule has been on the books of the Kentucky Racing Commission for a long time, but it is being applied with peculiar impact for the 126th Kentucky Derby on Saturday.</p>
        <p>It reads, ''Horses entered in the same race and owned wholly or in part by the same owner or spouse shall be joined as a mutuel entry and single betting interest.'' And the rules go on to say that ''a wager on one horse in a mutuel entry shall be a wager on all horses in the same mutuel entry.''</p>
        <p>So, syndication of racehorses these days produces this result in the Derby:</p>
        <p>Bob and Beverly Lewis of Los Angeles are the owners of High Yield, winner of the Blue Grass Stakes and probably the third favorite, and Commendable, a lesser horse who ran fourth in his last three starts. But since the Lewises are also members of a Dogwood Stable syndicate, they qualify as part owners of two Dogwood horses: Impeachment, third in the Arkansas Derby, and Trippi, winner of the Flamingo.</p>
        <p>''All four have to be joined under the rules,'' said Mike Watchmaker, national handicapper for The Daily Racing Form. ''By himself, High Yield might have been third choice in the Derby at 6-1. But when three other horses are added to his ticket, that increases your chances of winning and so it pulls the odds down, maybe to 5-1.''</p>
        <p>It also takes away the long-shot odds otherwise available for the horses linked with High Yield.</p>
        <p>''It happens with the mutuel field, when long shots are grouped,'' Watchmaker said. ''Last year in the Derby, they went off at pretty low odds, 11-1. But it is unusual to have a range of horses joined like this.''</p>
        <p>Pletcher's Multiple Choice</p>
        <p>With some owners, trainers and even bettors getting several chances to win the Derby, the trainer with the most chances is Todd Pletcher. A 32-year-old disciple of D. Wayne Lukas, Pletcher watched three of his four Derby colts as they worked out at Churchill Downs this morning. It was one day after their stablemate Trippi spun five furlongs in 593/5  seconds. This is Pletcher's first Derby, and he is approaching it with a herd.</p>
        <p>Bright and early, around 6:15 a.m., More Than Ready and Impeachment worked together for five furlongs in 1:004/5 .</p>
        <p>''Very good,'' Pletcher said. ''Just what we were after.''</p>
        <p>Then at 8 o'clock, Pletcher sent out Graeme Hall, winner of the Arkansas Derby, who spun five furlongs in 1:01. This time, the trainer chirped, ''He did it the right way; he came home strong.''</p>
        <p>But the Pletcher herd was not alone. Another early bird on the track was Anees, last year's juvenile champion, who worked five-eighths of a mile in 1:002/5 . His rider: Gary Stevens, the retired Hall of Fame jockey, who has won the Derby three times and now serves as assistant to the trainer, Alex Hassinger.</p>
        <p>''He was very aggressive, probably more so than any of his prior works,'' Steven said of Anees. ''I'm pretty confident that, as long as he's got a target in front of him, he is going to keep on about his business. As long as he gets up a half-stride from the wire, or five jumps, that would be all right with me.''</p>
        <p>Globalize, winner of the Spiral at Turfway Park and second in the Lexington at Keeneland, had to wait an hour for his jockey, Mike Smith, who was delayed on an overnight flight from California. But Smith showed up at 9:10, flak vest in place and helmet in hand, and led the colt through five furlongs in 1:02.</p>
        <p>''They messed me up on my red-eye,'' Smith reported. How about Globalize? ''He didn't work great, but he didn't work bad.''</p>
        <p>On the day after his famous stablemate Fusaichi Pegasus held his final workout, War Chant went to the track before sunrise for his dress rehearsal. He went six furlongs in 1:134/5 , prompting this comment from the trainer Neil Drysdale: ''I'm equally pleased with both horses, how they have trained here. They both have tactical speed, can relax and settle.''</p>
        <p>Lukas Sees No Superhorse</p>
        <p>Report from the top: D. Wayne Lukas has won the Kentucky Derby four times, most recently last year with Charismatic. His insight on the 126th Derby:</p>
        <p>''I don't see any exceptional horse. No Spectacular Bid, no Seattle Slew or Secretariat. In my opinion, I don't think they are here. I think we are getting more of an even keel in 20-horse fields, more horses with legitimate chances, but I don't see a dominant horse this year at all.''</p>
