        <p>The Clinton administration said today that the federal government expected to pay off substantially more of the national debt this year than previously projected.</p>
        <p>In a statement, President Clinton said the federal government intended to pay off $216 billion in debt during the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, or 6.2 percent of the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public.</p>
        <p>In February, the administration projected that it would pay off $167 billion this year.</p>
        <p>Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in a news conference at the White House today that the larger reduction was the result of the strong economy generating higher than expected tax revenues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers said there had been a surge in payments for 1999 tax liabilities made around the April 15 filing deadline and in corporate and individual tax payments so far in 2000.</p>
        <p>By the end of the fiscal year, he said, the government will have paid off $350 billion in debt since fiscal year 1998, reflecting the shift from decades of federal budget deficits to large and growing surpluses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers said debt reduction in April, May and June, the three months in which the government typically takes in the most money, should total $185 billion, up from $114 billion in the same period last year.</p>
        <p>''I think what we can take satisfaction in is that as a country we are not just making continued progress in reducing our national debt, but we are making progress at an accelerated pace,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Treasury Department is reducing the debt by rebuying bonds and other securities it has issued and by not renewing others on maturity.</p>
        <p>Administration officials used the news to strengthen their claim to being a force for fiscal prudence and the guardian of economic expansion. They sought to contrast their focus on debt reduction to calls from Republicans, who have a majority in Congress, and from Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, for big tax cuts.</p>
        <p>''We should not jeopardize the longest economic expansion in history with risky tax cuts that threaten our fiscal discipline,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Republicans said that they, not the administration, deserved credit for putting the government back in the black and that only by returning the surplus to taxpayers in the form of tax cuts could they stop Democrats  from spending the surplus.</p>
        <p>Republicans said that by keeping increases in government spending in check, there would be plenty of money for sizable tax cuts and for debt reduction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Summers said the administration had not yet calculated a new surplus estimate for the fiscal year. In February, the administration estimated that the total surplus this year would be $179 billion, including $148 billion from excess Social Security payroll tax revenues.</p>
        <p>Today's figures suggested that the surplus would be tens of billions of dollars higher than projected -- an improvement that would probably ripple into the surplus projection for next year, giving Congress a bigger pool of money as it turns this week to writing the spending bills that would finance the government's operations in 2001.</p>
