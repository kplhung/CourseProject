        <p>FREID-Dr. Jacob. The Jewish Braille Institute of America records with sorrow the passing of our Executive Director Emeritus whose professional leadership guided the Institute for more than a quarter of a century until his retirement in 1979. In the ensuing years, he remained as a deeply respected editor of the Jewish Braille Review and JBI Voice, the Institute's magazines for the blind and visually impaired worldwide. His love of Israel, dedication to blind people everywhere and his intellectual stature will long be remembered and cherished. May his memory serve as a blessing. Barbara B. Friedman, President Dr. Jane Evans, Honorary Pres. Gerald M. Kass, Executive VP</p>
