        <p>IN her black Gap leather jacket, black Prada skirt, beige Prada sandals, fashionably bare legs and surprisingly bare toenails, Elaina Richardson, in her next life as the president of the country's most famous arts colony, still looks the part of her old life.</p>
        <p>She is a fashion editor in chief, the kind who makes being a slave to style (bare legs all winter!) look like a fun option. She looks as if she has never had a bad hair day, looks as if she discovered her cascade of ethnic jewelry (she favors ''glorious fakes'') somewhere exotic, say, Istanbul.</p>

        <p>IN her black Gap leather jacket, black Prada skirt, beige Prada sandals, fashionably bare legs and surprisingly bare toenails, Elaina Richardson, in her next life as the president of the country's most famous arts colony, still looks the part of her old life.</p>
        <p>She is a fashion editor in chief, the kind who makes being a slave to style (bare legs all winter!) look like a fun option. She looks as if she has never had a bad hair day, looks as if she discovered her cascade of ethnic jewelry (she favors ''glorious fakes'') somewhere exotic, say, Istanbul.</p>
        <p>Yes, her jewels were a shopping find in Turkey, but looks, as they say, can be deceiving. Better to scotch the temptation to stereotype this self-possessed Glasgow export who has hovered atop Elle magazine's masthead for four years as just another smug fashion plate in a city brimming with well-dressed platters.</p>
        <p>''I would have been just as happy if it had been Scientific American -- it didn't have to be fashion,'' she recalls of her segue into American publishing, made 12 years ago when she landed her first editorial spot (at In Woman, now defunct) as a matter of fiscal survival.</p>
        <p>Now she is not certain whether to attribute it to millennial wanderlust or fear of typecasting -- the Oxford-educated Ms. Richardson never planned to turn into a trend-setter/ spotter at an industry glossy -- but in a career about-face that seems heretical in a for-profit dot-com decade, she has resigned her top spot at Elle to do a highbrow disappearing act. She is going upstate (no more bare legs in winter) to run the iconic Yaddo, a nonprofit artists colony founded in 1900.</p>
        <p>''I think as I wandered my way into publishing, that was never about money, either,'' says Ms. Richardson, a printer's daughter who grew up in a council flat in Glasgow and snagged her first journalism job at The Evening Standard there when she was 17.</p>
        <p>''It never occurred to me that being a writer was a way to make money. It felt like a way to have a kind of life that I was curious about, and this felt like the same thing,'' she said. ''I don't have those fears about money that some women talk about, their bag-lady fears, that they'll end up with nothing. Because I grew up in sort of a striving but working-class environment, I've always thought that, well, you work, that's what you do. I've worked since I was 13.''</p>
        <p>She suspects this new job ''will change the quality'' of her life, and took it for the same reason she veered away after college at Edinburgh and Oxford from what she feared might become a static life of letters in academia.</p>
        <p>''I don't like to feel as if I'm on autopilot,'' she said. ''In terms of what I wanted to achieve at Elle, I felt I'd done it. I thought that no woman now would only talk about her appearance, I mean, only an idiotic woman. Magazines that cover the fashion part of your life, if they don't also get into culture and current events, it's like sitting next to a dinner partner who's a dud.''</p>
        <p>WITH Elle safely delivered from dud-dom, what now? ''I was definitely thinking, 'Is there a next chapter?' '' Ms. Richardson admits.</p>
        <p>So last month, in a jolting genre jump, she handed in her fashionista badge (and that prime perk, a generous clothing allowance) to assume the reins of Yaddo, the retreat that sprawls across 400 acres of Gothic glory in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. From now on, instead of free Prada, Ms. Richardson will have to content herself with free poetry.</p>
        <p>The trade-off does not seem to scare her: a scholar who specialized in 18th-century dissident writers and poets, she has been known to write a poem or two. Not that she is at Yaddo to reawaken the artist slumbering within: ''The search committee was very careful, and I was very careful, not to romanticize this move: you absolutely do have a connection to the artists, but the job is administrative. I think I would define it as taking care of all the details, everything from if the roof's solid to if the endowment's secure.''</p>
        <p>At 38 she is the youngest and, with a resume jammed with short-lived jobs at pop culture publications, perhaps most surprising applicant to win the Yaddo presidency, traditionally a post for tweedy arts aficionados plucked from the ivory tower, not the 44th floor of a Manhattan skyscraper. Ms. Richardson is also the first president to bring a child to Yaddo: she and her husband, Kevin, a political writer working on a memoir of his Louisiana boyhood, and their 9-year-old daughter, Caitlin, will move into the president's residence, a secluded colonial called Southwoods, in September.</p>
        <p>Ms. Richardson, whose entourage includes a black Labrador retriever and a pony, warned Yaddo's executive board that her child is not the type to tiptoe around the hallowed grounds where Edgar Allan Poe (he frequented an on-site tavern some 50 years before the Trask family created the arts colony), and later John Cheever, James Baldwin, Aaron Copland and countless others craved and found artistic isolation. She recalls her family's first visit, when a subtle ''Beware of the Bats'' sign elicited yips of delight from her daughter.</p>
        <p>But the Yaddo search committee was smitten by Ms. Richardson's ''intelligent, lively seriousness and real love of the arts'' said Linda Collins, the committee chairwoman. And they do not hold her fashion savvy against her. After all, Yaddo's president will be spending 10 days each month in Manhattan, attending cocktail parties, openings and fund-raising events. Nice to know she already dresses the part.</p>
