        <p>Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban survivor of a sunken boat, was pressured by ''distant'' relatives to sign a political asylum claim that he neither wanted nor understood, a lawyer for his father asserted today in federal court documents.</p>
        <p>The boy, at the center of a wrenching legal battle between his Cuban father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and his Miami relatives, craves nothing so much as ''the familiarity of his own bedroom in Cardenas,'' Cuba, the lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, said in a brief submitted to the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''This father seeks to raise his family where he wants and how he wants,'' Mr. Craig continued. ''This right is no less important to people from Cuba than it is to Americans.''</p>
        <p>With blunt language, Mr. Craig asked the appeals court to reject a political asylum claim filed on Elian's behalf by Mr. Gonzalez's uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez. A federal district court in Miami backed up the federal government's assertion that the asylum claim was invalid, but the Miami relatives have appealed that ruling and a hearing on the appeal is scheduled for May 11.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Lazaro Gonzalez and his family have insisted that the boy wants to remain in the United States -- they have made public a videotape in which Elian announced that he did not want to return to Cuba -- and that he had a general understanding of the legal papers filed on his behalf.</p>
        <p>In a countering brief filed today, Lazaro Gonzalez's lawyers accused the Immigration and Naturalization Service of trampling on Elian's rights in its haste to reunite him with his father.</p>
        <p>''Without ever meeting the child or considering the merits of his claim under established asylum procedures,'' the countering brief said, ''the I.N.S. determined that it did not think this boy's claims worthy of traditional adjudication, and then proceeded to ensure that his claims would never see the light of day.''</p>
        <p>But in his brief, Mr. Craig asserted that Elian could not possibly understand the asylum claim filed in his name, which was in English. Elian, the brief said, does not read his native Spanish, much less English.</p>
        <p>Even if he had a legitimate fear of persecution in his homeland, a child of Elian's age is incapable of expressing that fear, the brief said. Courts have previously ruled that the ''lower end'' of the age range in which one can credibly lodge such a concern is about 12, it said.</p>
        <p>''Juan Miguel knows his own child and knows not only that his child has no fear, but also that he could not express the fears contemplated by U.S. immigration law in any event,'' the brief asserted.</p>
        <p>Unlike Lazaro Gonzalez, a staunch critic of President Fidel Castro of Cuba, a child of Elian's age would hardly have political concerns, the brief said. It cited a physician, Paulina F. Kernberg, who found that Elian's understanding of the world was ''what one would expect from a 6-year-old.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kernberg said the boy asserted himself freely in his father's presence, refusing to take his vitamin C pill and to drink all his milk.</p>
        <p>The document asserted that Juan Miguel Gonzalez has demonstrated that his decision to return to Cuba with Elian was free from Cuban government coercion, despite the accusations of many Cuban-Americans. Mr. Gonzalez, his second wife, Nersy Carmenate Castillo, and their infant child were reunited with Elian on April 22, and are now under the protection of United States marshals on a private estate in Maryland.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing stopping Juan Miguel from telling the marshals that he wants to be protected from the Cuban government as much as he wants to be protected from the relatives in Miami,'' the brief said. ''He has not done so.''</p>
