        <p>Sam Ramer, an assistant district attorney in the Bronx, watches ''Eyewitness News'' to keep up with breaking crime stories and spends late evenings with Ted and Sunday mornings with Cokie and Sam. He's also a big fan of other ABC programs like ''NYPD Blue'' and ''The Practice.''</p>
        <p>But don't count Mr. Ramer among the millions of Time Warner Cable subscribers across the country who woke up yesterday to find that one of their favorite networks had gone dark. He took action 10 days ago just to forestall such disappointment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramer and his neighbors got together and bought a satellite dish for their brownstone in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. Each of the five families was able to get a service package from DirecTV for about $40 a month -- $20 less than Mr. Ramer was paying for cable service from Time Warner.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Ramer, the ABC-Time Warner dispute ''turned out to be a blessing in disguise,'' he said. ''You really think you have only one option,'' he added, ''and it's not until you are forced into action that you realize that as a consumer, you have a right to better service.'' ABC is a unit of Walt Disney.</p>
        <p>But for other television viewers -- whether they are addicted to one of ABC's longrunning daytime soap operas or the surprise hit ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' -- the timing of the blackout was especially irritating. It arrived just at the start of the May sweeps period, when the competition for ratings heats up and viewers can expect special developments -- the return of a much-missed character of ''All My Children,'' for example, or more celebrity contestants on ''Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>Satellite providers like DirecTV and EchoStar Communications hope to capitalize on that unhappiness. They say the disruption is likely to prove a bonanza, pushing many people who have been contemplating switching into finally acting. Both companies said sales had already increased in Houston, where the Time Warner-Disney squabble first surfaced in March.</p>
        <p>Seizing the window of opportunity, EchoStar is running an advertising campaign advising that ABC programs can be seen through the company's Dish TV service and offering a free dish, receiver and remote control plus installation to cable customers, said Judianne Atencio, an EchoStar spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>In March, the ABC affiliate in Houston gave Time Warner customers more than 4,000 vouchers that could be redeemed for DirecTV satellite dishes. The two companies are close to signing another agreement that would include rebates on both the dish and the installation, said Robert A. Marsocci, a DirecTV spokesman.</p>
        <p>Fighting back, Time Warner pointed out that subscribers could still watch ABC programs by installing an A/B switch and an antenna and offered to reimburse them up to $15 for the cost. Tony Magoulas, a spokesman for Radio Shack, said it was too early to tell if the tactic was working. But he said one store in Houston had reported a tenfold increase in antenna sales.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani scoffed at the antenna idea as ''stupid'' in New York, which has so many tall buildings. Similarly, satellite dishes are not always a practical option for Manhattan residents -- unless their apartment includes a balcony. Another company, RCN, hopes to lure some high-rise-dwelling Time Warner customers into signing up for a package that includes telephone service, a high-speed Internet connection and cable. RCN now serves 70,000 customers in the 800 Manhattan buildings equipped with the company's fiber optic cable and is weighing whether to step up its marketing efforts, said Valerie C. Haertel, a company spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Time Warner Cable offices were flooded with complaints. By 10 a.m., the company's Los Angeles division had received 300 calls -- half from people who were angry about the service disruption and half from people who were concerned that their rates might be affected, said Robert Moel, a Time Warner vice president.</p>
        <p>Other people voiced their complaints directly to Soap Opera Digest, a weekly publication with a circulation of one million. ''Think about the investment these people make in their shows -- the amount of time they spend and the passion they feel,'' said Lynn Leahey, the editor in chief. She recalled that when some of the soaps were pre-empted for the murder trial of O. J. Simpson, some viewers never came back.</p>
