        <p>During flybys of Io last November and Europa in January, NASA's Galileo spacecraft also cast its camera askance at some smaller targets: Thebe, Amalthea and Metis, three of Jupiter's innermost moons.</p>
        <p>Galileo also snapped a sharp image of Amalthea last August as the space probe lined itself up for the flybys.</p>
        <p>''For the first time, we can start to resolve surface features on them,'' said Dr. Duane Bindschadler, manager for science planning and operations for Galileo. ''We see things that are distinctly impact craters.''</p>
        <p>On Thebe, astronomers saw a 25-mile-wide crater, which is tentatively named Zeus. Thebe itself is only about 60 miles across. A bright patch of unknown composition can be seen in a crater near Amalthea's south pole.</p>
        <p>The close-ups of Amalthea also yielded the clearest look yet of a feature known as Ida. What previously was only a blotchy bright spot is now seen as a 30-mile-long streak, possibly material thrown out by a meteor impact or the crest of a ridge.</p>
        <p>Metis, 25 miles wide, is the innermost of all of Jupiter's moons, orbiting just 80,000 miles from the giant planet. Amalthea, about 155 miles wide, is 112,000 miles out, and Thebe is 138,000 miles away from Jupiter. Galileo did not get a picture of Adrastea, the fourth inner moon.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Io, the closest of Jupiter's major moons, orbits at a distance of 262,000 miles.</p>
