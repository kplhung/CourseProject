        <p>Landlords of the one million rent-stabilized apartments in New York City yesterday proposed a rent increase of 9 percent for a one-year lease and 15 percent for a two-year lease. They cited higher operating costs, notably the price of fuel oil for heat and hot water.</p>
        <p>''Significant inflationary pressures are building,'' said Jack Freund, vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlords' group. It will detail its position at a hearing today before the city's Rent Guidelines Board. The board has scheduled a preliminary vote for Monday on the maximum rent increases on stabilized apartments for leases renewed in the year starting Oct. 1.</p>

        <p>Landlords of the one million rent-stabilized apartments in New York City yesterday proposed a rent increase of 9 percent for a one-year lease and 15 percent for a two-year lease. They cited higher operating costs, notably the price of fuel oil for heat and hot water.</p>
        <p>''Significant inflationary pressures are building,'' said Jack Freund, vice president of the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlords' group. It will detail its position at a hearing today before the city's Rent Guidelines Board. The board has scheduled a preliminary vote for Monday on the maximum rent increases on stabilized apartments for leases renewed in the year starting Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>The debate over rent is intensifying this year, after a long period of modest increases. For five of the last six years, the board has approved increases of 2 percent for a one-year lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease.</p>
        <p>But last week, the board released its annual study of the landlords' operating costs, showing a rise of 7.8 percent. At the same time, the board's chairman, Edward S. Hochman, proposed changes in the rent formula that could result in increases of 8.5 percent for a one-year lease and 12 percent for a two-year lease, although he said he did not expect those numbers to be adopted.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who appoints the rent board, called those numbers ''very, very high'' and stressed that no decisions had been made.</p>
