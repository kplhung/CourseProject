        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>LAST TO HONOR KING  With the signature of Gov. Jim Hodges, South Carolina yesterday became the last state to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with an official holiday. The bill was signed despite protests from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which had opposed the legislation because it also created Confederate Memorial Day on May 10. The organization said two such contrasting ideologies should not be linked. A spokesman for Mr. Hodges said he would have preferred a bill honoring only Dr. King but had to accept the Confederate holiday as the price for passage. The N.A.A.C.P. has also objected to a Senate bill, now before the House, to move the Confederate battle flag from the Capitol dome to a memorial in front of the building. Meanwhile, officials in North Carolina said that despite the furor in South Carolina, a Confederate flag would be over the Capitol in Raleigh on May 10, as is required annually under a legislative decree. The flag also is flown every Jan. 19, Robert E. Lee's birthday. Representative Eva Clayton said the dome was not the proper place for such a flag.</p>

        <p>BABBITT TO RETURN HOME  There has been considerable speculation in Arizona that once Bruce Babbitt finished his tour as secretary of the interior, he would return to the state to run for governor, a job he held from 1978 to 1986. But Mr. Babbitt said over the weekend that he had other plans. He would return to Arizona, he told The Arizona Republic, but not to run for governor. ''I'm out of politics, but I'm back to Arizona,'' he said. ''I'm a little homesick. I want to re-engage as a citizen.'' He did not say what he planned to do. But he made it clear that he was tired of Washington's ''witch-hunting mentality,'' referring to the 19-month investigation by an independendent counsel into his handling of permits for Indian reservation casinos. He was cleared of any wrongdoing. ''Maybe I was the poster child for the repeal of the independent counsel statute,'' he said.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>RUBIN PLAYS DOWN SPOT ON TICKET  Former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, one of many prominent Democrats mentioned as a potential running mate for Vice President Al Gore, seemed to reject the idea yesterday, calling it ''a curious notion.'' Discussing economic policy and what he saw as key issues in the campaign, Mr. Rubin said that while he has been around politics for many years, including a stint as a Democratic fund-raiser, he viewed running for and serving in office as a special field, ''something unto itself.'' Mr. Rubin suggested that it was unwise to choose a nominee who had not been tested by other campaigns. ''I have never run for office,'' he said. ''You don't want somebody in a presidential campaign, which is the ultimate of political experience in this country, who hasn't been tested by running before.'' Mr. Rubin spoke on Political Points, the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News.</p>

        <p>THE GREENS</p>
        <p>NADER COURTS AUTO WORKERS  The consumer advocate and Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader discussed an endorsement yesterday with leaders of the United Automobile Workers in Detroit. Mr. Nader said that he did not directly ask for an endorsement and that the union would not endorse a candidate until after a Congressional vote, scheduled for late May, on establishing permanent normal trade relations with China. Mr. Nader, the auto workers and other major unions oppose the bill. Instead of asking for endorsements, Mr. Nader said: ''I just tell people what we're doing.'' Union officials were unavailable for comment. The union, which has criticized President Clinton's trade policies, broke with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in October, when the labor federation endorsed Vice President Al Gore.</p>
