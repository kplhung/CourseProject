        <p>There was not much depth to ''Face the Music and Dance,'' a series devoted to matching choreographers and composers, on Thursday night at Symphony Space. But the sheer impudent vitality of Mark Dendy's ''JAM,'' created with the jazz clarinetist Don Byron, nearly made up for that in an evening completed by ''The Routine,'' created by the choreographic team of Danial Shapiro and Joanie Smith and the composer Scott Killian.</p>
        <p>''JAM'' literally spilled out from the audience and up onto the stage. First came a snail's-crawl processional for Mr. Byron and his clarinet up an aisle, followed by the sudden lively sprouting of dancers in the audience. Once on stage, the eight dancers merged into handsome lines and clusters and separated for rollicking stage-crosses and solos, duets and small ensembles. Dressed in inky blue and illuminated by Dale Knoth's stark, subtly dramatic lighting, the dancers' bodies often looked like flying fish.</p>

        <p>There was not much depth to ''Face the Music and Dance,'' a series devoted to matching choreographers and composers, on Thursday night at Symphony Space. But the sheer impudent vitality of Mark Dendy's ''JAM,'' created with the jazz clarinetist Don Byron, nearly made up for that in an evening completed by ''The Routine,'' created by the choreographic team of Danial Shapiro and Joanie Smith and the composer Scott Killian.</p>
        <p>''JAM'' literally spilled out from the audience and up onto the stage. First came a snail's-crawl processional for Mr. Byron and his clarinet up an aisle, followed by the sudden lively sprouting of dancers in the audience. Once on stage, the eight dancers merged into handsome lines and clusters and separated for rollicking stage-crosses and solos, duets and small ensembles. Dressed in inky blue and illuminated by Dale Knoth's stark, subtly dramatic lighting, the dancers' bodies often looked like flying fish.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dendy seemed to be reaching for overall shape in this sprawling first formal venture into plotless dance. And several strong, small dances emerged from the sea of moving bodies, among them a sensuous and imaginatively partnered male duet and a wild and witty modern-dance tango. A haunting dance for Steven Ochoa looked fascinatingly like a vision of George Balanchine's ''Phlegmatic'' solo reinterpreted with Paul Taylor's sense of body mass and momentum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dendy and Mr. Byron and their performers achieved a nubbly-textured knit of dance and music. The fine cast of dancers also included Nicole Berger, Timothy Bish, Ashley Gilbert, Alexander Gish, Kristin McDonald, Megan Sikora and Ron Todorowski.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byron's quietly compelling ensemble was completed by Mauro Refosco on percussion and Edward Simon on piano. Bobby Pearce designed the costumes.</p>
        <p>''The Routine'' sprawled, too, as Mr. Shapiro, Ms. Smith and Mr. Killian tried to evoke at very great length the difficult lives and thwarted ambitions of Borscht Belt vaudevillians of the 1950's. Publicity material describes the choreographers, who are known as Shapiro &amp; Smith, as probing the subtexts of failed comedy routines, wild Latin dances and buried Holocaust memories. One subtext would have been enough. Three were a jumble, and none of them convincing.</p>
        <p>There were moments that recalled the duo's gift for plotted dramatic dance. The final image, when Mr. Shapiro's hand wrapped around Ms. Smith's neck and pulled her off like a gentle vaudeville hook, said more than anything that came before, despite strong dance performing from John Beasant III, Susie Bracken, Matthew Janczewski, Midori Satoh and Lilliane Stillwell.</p>
        <p>The irritating text was written and spoken by David Greenspan. The lighting was by Stephen Petrilli, the costumes by Mary Claire O'Brien and Constance Hoffman. Mr. Killian performed with Jeff Berman, Bruce Huran, Carol Lipkin and Dom Richards.</p>
