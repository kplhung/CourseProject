        <p>With its sibling rivalry, family entanglements and political intrigue, it sounds like a story out of Arthur Miller.</p>
        <p>The older brother, the one named after the father, is a wealthy and powerful real estate lawyer married to Westchester County's glamorous and ambitious district attorney. The younger brother plods along, overshadowed, as a shy accountant who really likes his Yankees and Rangers.</p>
        <p>But the lopsided relationship between Albert J. Pirro Jr. and Anthony G. Pirro has badly frayed since they were indicted on Federal tax-fraud charges in February 1999. And the resulting family drama is imperiling not just one of Westchester's most powerful deal-makers, Albert Pirro, but also the county government's most dynamic political figure, his wife, District Attorney Jeanine F. Pirro.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, jury selection for the trial of the brothers Pirro is expected to commence in Federal District Court in what is being viewed as one of the biggest and juiciest cases here in recent memory.</p>
        <p>There promises to be a voyeuristic element to the trial: the opportunity to pry into the lavish spending habits of Albert and Jeanine Pirro, hear more about Albert Pirro's recent suggestion that political enemies engineered the charges, and see whether the brothers will continue to bash each other in court. So far, each has blamed the other for the tax mess, offering unflattering details about everything from drug use to mental incompetence.</p>
        <p>But years from now, the trial may be best remembered as the pivotal moment in Ms. Pirro's political career. While Ms. Pirro has not been charged with any wrongdoing, the resulting innuendo has apparently torpedoed her immediate chances at higher office -- aspirations that could have put her name seriously in play if Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani pulls out of the race for United States Senate.</p>
        <p>''I think she has tremendous instincts for survival and self-protection, but this is just a matter of damage control,'' said Bennett L. Gershman, a professor at Pace University School of Law here. ''People want to know: how involved was she? How much did she know? You'd think that someone of her caliber and ability -- being a prosecutor, being so much in the limelight -- how could she not know? How could she have her head in the sand?''</p>
        <p>Already, lawyers, politicians and others have groped for political and literary parallels. Legal precedent and celebrity wattage? Leona Helmsley. A politically prominent woman with a husband dogged by allegations of business improprieties? Geraldine A. Ferraro. Sheer brotherly strain? Maybe Biff and Happy Loman.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the closest, and most appropriate, analogy is that the Pirros are a miniature version of another powerful couple in Westchester with an overshadowed brother, hounded by political enemies and aggressive prosecutors: the Clintons of Chappaqua.</p>
        <p>And make no mistake, the elder Pirro contends that the Government's charges that he and his brother illegally deducted $1 million in personal spending as business expenses are driven by politics, not law. A vast left-wing conspiracy, perhaps.</p>
        <p>''We are not the only people in the United States of America who are being subjected to the Clinton administration's investigative tactics into campaigns that are being run by Republicans,'' a coiled and irate Albert Pirro said at a news conference on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''Look, everybody knows my wife could have been and should have been a statewide candidate for political office by now. The only thing that's held her back has been the fact that her husband has been subjected to constant spotlight and scrutiny and criticism for business transactions.''</p>
        <p>One of the most tantalizing questions in the case is whether Ms. Pirro, 48, will testify. To date, she has remained silent since defending her husband at a news conference on the day the charges were filed.</p>
        <p>Since becoming district attorney in 1993, Ms. Pirro, a protegee of Gov. George E. Pataki, has been cast as a Republican superstar for her image as a crusader (against domestic violence and Internet pedophilia) and a telegenic natural (she has modeled for the photographer Annie Leibovitz and appeared regularly on national television).</p>
        <p>Her husband, Albert Pirro, 52, is the most successful real estate development lawyer in an affluent county that ranks second statewide in per-capita income, after Manhattan. He is also a formidable lobbyist and Republican fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Pirro, who is widely known as Al, is often credited with a major role in his wife's political career, he has also been viewed as an albatross. In 1986, she bowed out as a candidate for lieutenant governor amid questions about his brief stake in a Connecticut garbage-hauling company, an industry notorious for its mob associations. Last June, DNA tests revealed that Mr. Pirro was the father of a teenage Indiana girl whose mother had sued him for child support.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Mary Jo White, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, began to investigate Mr. Pirro after a former Yonkers official accused him of giving him a $5,000 bribe. No criminal charges resulted, but Federal prosecutors then looked at Mr. Pirro's tax records -- hence last year's indictment.</p>
        <p>Between 1988 and 1997, prosecutors charged, Mr. Pirro -- with Anthony as his accountant -- claimed more than $1 million in deductions for business expenses for what prosecutors said was personal spending  on items like a $40,000 gate and a $3,700 awning for his Italianate house in Harrison, as well as cruise tickets, baby-sitting services and other items.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pirro was not named in the indictment. But last week, in court papers, prosecutors called a bank loan that she had secured to buy a Mercedes-Benz ''a sham.'' In reality, prosecutors said, one of her husband's companies paid off the loan in order to claim a fraudulent deduction.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Pirro's supporters, the charges seem excessive; in 1998, before he was indicted, Mr. Pirro repaid the government $957,000 in back taxes and interest. So to prosecute now, they say, seems overly zealous.</p>
        <p>''Even after five years of investigations of every single agency imaginable, we come down to what?'' Albert Pirro said on Thursday. ''The last refuge of a desperate prosecutor: a tax case.''</p>
        <p>Government prosecutors, however, contend that the Pirro brothers have shown a pattern of deception that transcends any civil penalties -- as was the case with Mrs. Helmsley.</p>
        <p>''Legally speaking, I think it's significant because the reason for prosecuting high-profile tax cases is for the deterrent effect,'' said James R. DeVita, who was the lead prosecutor in the Helmsley case.</p>
        <p>If convicted on all charges, Albert Pirro faces a maximum jail sentence of five years on a conspiracy count, five years on each of four tax evasion counts and three years on each of 28 false tax return counts. His brother faces similar charges, plus a separate trial on his own tax returns.</p>
        <p>Anthony Pirro, 45, has never consented to an interview, and his lawyer, Roger L. Stavis, declined to comment on the case. Friends say that the younger Pirro, an unassuming family man, attends Rangers and Yankees games and shops at discount stores.</p>
        <p>Yet Anthony has been portrayed as being weak and so impaired by cocaine -- as evidenced by a 1992 possession conviction in Virginia -- that he was unable to perform his accounting duties. So contends his brother, who also asserted in court papers that Anthony had undergone psychological counseling for ''excessive gambling, how to appropriately stand up for his rights in business, and his relationships with his parents and siblings.''</p>
        <p>Albert Pirro even said he had secretly videotaped his brother as Anthony admitted responsibility for the botched tax returns. (The tape was later thrown out as unreliable by Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr.)</p>
        <p>''I think that Anthony was in over his head,'' said Michael R. Edelman, a Republican political consultant and family friend. ''I think he wanted to show his bigger brother he could do a good job.''</p>
        <p>Not to be outdone, Anthony revealed in court papers that Albert had been treated with Prozac and lithium, and had been a patient at a psychiatric hospital in Summit, N.J.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker has not yet decided whether these medical details will be included in the trial. Other evidence awaiting a ruling on admissibility involves allegations of improper tax deductions for hiring a part-time private investigator (and full-time employee in Ms. Pirro's office) who, prosecutors contend, helped a friend of Albert Pirro's evade taxes.</p>
        <p>One thing that will be absent from the trial, though, is perhaps the most tantalizing political tidbit: the implication that Robert E. Boyle, a Republican powerhouse and the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, may have been involved in improper business deals with the Pirros.</p>
        <p>In the original indictment, federal prosecutors said that the Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Peekskill had leased space in a building in Croton, N.Y., owned by Mr. Pirro and Mr. Boyle. And though Mr. Boyle -- who was not named in the indictment -- was the hospital's chairman, he did not disclose that he was a co-owner of the building or that he received $292,000 from a separate Pirro company, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>Judge Parker later dismissed the charge, the only one in the indictment that prosecutors said involved Mr. Boyle. The judge's decision was upheld by a Federal appellate court. But the Pirro-Boyle deal is still under scrutiny, because of a recent civil suit filed by the state's Democratic attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, which Republicans contend is politically motivated.</p>
        <p>The appellate decision on the Pirro-Boyle deal has not been finalized, which may delay opening arguments, set for May 10. But once the  trial is under way, it is expected to last six weeks, with plenty of legal fireworks.</p>
        <p>Albert Pirro's legal team includes Gustave H. Newman, who successfully defended Robert A. Altman, the Washington lawyer ensnarled in the fraud inquiry into the Bank of Credit and Commerce International; and Robert J. Giuffra Jr., a former Senate Whitewater counsel who won E. Robert Wallach's appeal in the influence-peddling scandal relating to the collapse of Wedtech, a defense contractor.</p>
        <p>The government's team includes Elliott B. Jacobson, who squared off against Mr. Giuffra in the Wallach case, and Cathy Seibel, who helped to prosecute Ms. Helmsley.</p>
        <p>Regardless of how the Pirros fare in the trial, and whether Ms. Pirro's  political career can emerged unscathed, one poignant question is whether the two brothers will ever be able to mend their relationship.</p>
        <p>''It's very difficult, but maybe Al has to choose his immediate family,  meaning Jeanine and the children, over the long-term benefit of his  brother,'' Mr. Edelman said. ''That may be a difficult choice, but maybe a choice he had to make.''</p>
