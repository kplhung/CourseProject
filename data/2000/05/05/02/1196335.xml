        <p>Donna Hanover announced yesterday that she was postponing her performance in ''The Vagina Monologues'' because of ''personal family circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover's announcement came four days after her husband, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, announced that he had prostate cancer and that he would spend the next two weeks deciding on a course of treatment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover had been scheduled to take a lead role starting May 30 in the Off Broadway hit, which features monologues on topics like orgasm and childbirth. She made her announcement in this two-sentence statement released by her office: ''Due to personal family circumstances, I have decided to postpone my performance in 'The Vagina Monologues.' I will work with the show's producers and directors to set a date to join another team of esteemed actresses in the future.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover had been scheduled to appear for two weeks in the show with the actresses Kirstie Alley and Hazelle Goodman. David Stone, the lead producer of the show, said yesterday that he expected Ms. Hanover to rejoin the show ''soon, in a couple of months.'' Ms. Hanover, an actress and television personality who has led a separate public life from the mayor since 1996, had no further comment yesterday. Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said the mayor also had no comment.</p>
        <p>Eve Ensler, the author of ''The Vagina Monologues'' and a friend and political supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the mayor's opponent for United States Senate, was traveling in Afghanistan yesterday and was unavailable for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's aides have said the mayor would not have been able to attend his wife's opening night performance May 30, which would have occurred on the same night as the state Republican convention, where Mr. Giuliani is expected to be designated as the party's Senate nominee.</p>
        <p>''My wife is independent, she leads an independent life, so do I,'' the mayor said last month. ''I think those discussions will be private discussions about whether I do or don't'' attend.</p>
        <p>A friend of Ms. Hanover's said yesterday that the mayor's wife probably made her decision because of the practical concerns of having to perform six nights a week with two children at home while her husband might be in the hospital or undergoing treatment.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Giuliani said yesterday at his daily City Hall news briefing that he had met with his doctors in the morning but had had no further tests for his cancer, which is in an early, treatable form.</p>
        <p>''I even asked the doctor, 'Any more tests?' '' Mr. Giuliani said. ''It would be good to have another test. There are no more tests. It's just a matter of analyzing all of the information that's there, and figuring out the right option. Which is, you know, complicated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also told reporters not to expect regular bulletins on his health. ''I'm not going to give you daily medical updates,'' he said, laughing. ''You want to know the discussions with my doctor today and the whole thing?'' Mr. Giuliani added that after he got some second opinions, ''which will be, you know, in a week or so, then we'll discuss it.''</p>
        <p>The mayor said again that he was ''hopeful'' that he would be able to run for Senate, but that his health was his first priority. ''My first decision, and the way I'm going to keep my mind focused on this is, what is the best option in terms of getting the most complete cure? I'm still less than a week into analyzing this, and that's what I'm going to do. Running is something I would like to do. Being alive and healthy is more important.''</p>
