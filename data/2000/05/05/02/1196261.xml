        <p>In mid-May, Azzedine Alaia, the Tunisian-born designer whose rare public displays of genius place him somewhere between Charles James and the Shadow, will present his largest collection in years. Many of the 117 store buyers who have been summoned are expected to come, even though Mr. Alaia, who doesn't adhere to seasons or the calendar, is presenting his fall clothes months behind the rest of the fashion world.</p>
        <p>On top of this, a retrospective of his work is being planned for the fall in New York, and Mr. Alaia, who ranks as one of the last real couturiers -- he does everything, from the patternmaking and  -cutting to the pinning and ironing, with his own hands -- said he will present a small couture collection during the shows here in July, which would be a first.</p>
        <p>The news that Mr. Alaia has something substantial to show comes at a time when many people in the business assume he has nothing at all. It's not unusual to hear fashion editors say: ''Azzedine? Is he still making clothes?'' when a visit to 7 rue de Moussy in the Marais, where Mr. Alaia has his studio and employs 25 people, would tell them that he is.</p>
        <p>Yet it is hard not to feel that Mr. Alaia has managed his own oblivion. He has done this in part by refusing, since 1992, to hold runway shows, in the belief that they are outmoded, and in part by delivering his clothes to stores late, or not at all. The only American store to have carried Mr. Alaia's clothes consistently since he began doing ready-to-wear in the early 1980's is Barneys New York, and its executives have long been reconciled to planning their seasonal budgets around him -- a concession granted to no other designer. ''There is no cancellation date for him,'' J. P. Correa, a buyer for the store.</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Alaia's ultra-sexy dresses may fly out the door once they do arrive, other retailers aren't so indulgent. Jacqueline Schnabel, who opened an Alaia boutique in SoHo in 1987 when she was married to the painter Julian Schnabel, said she had been forced to close it after five years because of delivery problems -- a decision that drew a characteristic reaction from Mr. Alaia.</p>
        <p>''He refused to even walk on Mercer,'' said Ms. Schnabel, adding with a light laugh: ''Now it's O.K. He came by a couple of years ago with Julian, and we made up.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Alaia is diminutive in size and bears a resemblance to Gertrude Stein, as the writer Ingrid Sischy once noted, with his pixie bangs and round, many-dimpled face, he can be intimidating. ''He'll just sort of glare at you,'' said the photographer Michael Roberts, ''and you'll think, 'What have I done?' But he's very funny when you get to know him.'' When Simon Doonan of Barneys sensed a few years ago that Mr. Alaia's prestige was slipping, he created some windows filled with glowing fan tributes. Mr. Alaia's only response to Mr. Doonan's list of luminaries was, ''Where is the queen mother?''</p>
        <p>There are a lot of reasons at the moment to pay attention to what Azzedine Alaia is doing. For one thing, the current revival of 80's fashion will mean a rush of Alaia references. No designer defined the decade with more giddy authority. Mr. Alaia's clothes -- the studded leather gloves, the clingy skirts and stretch dresses inspired by Egyptian mummies -- didn't just emphasize the feminine body. They drew a circle around it and marked it with a dot. ''He orchestrated the collision between sex and fashion,'' Mr. Doonan said. ''It looked French. It looked severe.''</p>
        <p>In those years, Mr. Alaia's atelier was like an all-hours salon, with 3 a.m. fittings and a surfeit of supermodels. ''Everyone used to go around and sit for hours,'' Mr. Roberts recalled. ''It became family. Azzedine could talk on the phone, two phones, and still be pinning clothes on models. It was fascinating. You just don't see that kind of thing anymore. Maybe you didn't then.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Doonan remembers going to shows when Mr. Alaia would still be pressing clothes at the last moment. ''Yes, the shows were totally chaotic,'' said the model Veronica Webb. ''But let me tell you something: even if your shirt was still hot from the iron, you knew you were above reproach. You might as well have had a crown and a scepter.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Alaia isn't interested in reviving the 80's, least of all himself. He has put into his archives in the basement of his house virtually every garment he has made. It is a gold mine of style. But pull from the crowded racks, say, a leather blouson jacket and ask him if he might repeat it, and he will shake his head and mutter, ''No, no.''</p>
        <p>It's also true that Mr. Alaia has managed to do something rare in the fashion world. ''He knows how to retire from the whole thing,'' said the shoe designer Manolo Blahnik. ''He was right not do any more runway shows. Why should he do those horrible exercises, which is like supermarket nonsense?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alaia has always made clothes for private clients, but without fanfare. Indeed, anyone who takes the trouble to drop by rue de Moussy, where Mr. Alaia lives on the top floor with Christoph von Weyhe, a painter who is his business manager, and a pack of dogs and cats, might be surprised by who turns up these days. One evening last February, Mouna Ayoub, the couture patron, came by to discuss a long buff suede skirt that Mr. Alaia was making for her. On another night, Bettina Graziani, a well-known model from the 1950's, was being fitted for a suit of speckled English tweed in the ground-floor boutique.</p>
        <p>And in March, at the Vanity Fair Oscar party, Carine Roitfeld arrived straight from styling Gucci's fall ads wearing a new Alaia gown with a leopard-stenciled calf top laced almost savagely up her bare back. As Ms. Roitfeld said, explaining her choice that fashion-heavy night, ''I went to Azzedine because I knew I would be the only one.''</p>
        <p>It is a remarkable thing to be so devoted to one's craft as to be considered, almost by default, the only one. But that is exactly what Mr. Alaia has become. He has never had backers nor licensed his name, and though he has come close, Mr. von Weyhe said, to signing deals for a perfume or to design another company's line (he was approached by Dior in the early 90's), he has refused, even though it would have meant more money. ''Quite simply, I do things how I like to do them,'' Mr. Alaia said. ''I prefer to stay poor than to give my name over to someone who's going to do what they want.''</p>
        <p>Peter Brant, an art collector who is married to the model Stephanie Seymour, and who has been talking with the Guggenheim Museum about doing an Alaia exhibition this fall at the Guggenheim in SoHo, said he has tried to give Mr. Alaia financial advice, but to no avail. Mr. Alaia certainly doesn't sell as much as he did in the 80's, and there was a while in the mid-90's when he didn't seem to produce much at all.</p>
        <p>Not that it affected his chic or his cult much. Five years ago, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington flew in just to model Mr. Alaia's clothes for the half-dozen retailers who were present.</p>
        <p>''Women will never let me be forgotten,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alaia said the business makes enough money to support his staff. His one indulgence seems to be buying vintage couture clothes -- Charles James, Adrian, Vionnet. One imagines that this is his way of communing with kindred spirits.</p>
        <p>Francois Lesage, the embroidery maker, who has known Mr. Alaia for years, said: ''It is easier to look at Azzedine's place in the fashion world than to explain it. He is a little bit like a temple of fashion. His sensibility is so much in opposition to the way to act, to live today, that he reminds me of Balenciaga. He loves to talk and laugh, but when he is alone, he's alone.''</p>
        <p>As much as Mr. Alaia enjoys paradox, and is frequently as vague as a child, his clothes have always expressed an exceptional clarity. They are about cut, line, silhouette. And it makes you realize just how much contemporary fashion is based on obscuring the lack of invention or thought with gimmicks and cheap revivalism. Mr. Alaia, who usually stays up until 5 a.m. sewing and watching old movies (and gets up again at 9 a.m.), will often spend months perfecting a cut or pattern, which in modern fashion time is biblical. For his latest collection, he has been working on leather kilts with tiny flowers embroidered on the pleats. The process started more than a year ago.</p>
        <p>Mr. Correa has watched Mr. Alaia's ideas evolve, too, and he said he may even see, later in May, a few things for next spring. But it's all right if he doesn't. ''I see hundreds of collections a year, but the trips I make to Azzedine's are the highlight of my year,'' Mr. Correa said. ''In my entire career, I will never see it again.''</p>
