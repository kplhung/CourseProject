        <p>Fighting to defeat the government's proposal to break the company in two, Microsoft plans to ask the trial judge next week for broad authority to obtain hundreds of pages of government records on the case, and for permission to summon witnesses to argue that the proposal is unwarranted and out of bounds.</p>
        <p>''Their extreme request for relief invites questions on how they came to the observations and conclusions in their declaration,'' William H. Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The effort could take many months, going ''well into the fall,'' Mr. Neukom said. Government officials called the company's action simply a stalling tactic, possibly intended to delay the ruling until the next administration took office. Microsoft denied that intent, and outside experts noted that the company might not gain any particular advantage from a delay.</p>
        <p>If a new administration were more sympathetic to Microsoft, it could in theory settle or drop the federal case at any time -- even if an appeal were before the Supreme Court. But the case brought by the 19 state attorneys general who are the Justice Department's partners in the case would remain active. The attorneys general have repeatedly said they would persevere no matter what the Justice Department did.</p>
        <p>Microsoft says it has lobbied both likely presidential nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush, to influence their views of the case and to counter lobbying by its competitors. Mr. Bush has made a few unspecific comments about the case sympathetic to Microsoft, while Mr. Gore has declined to discuss it.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department and 17 of the state attorneys general filed their remedy request with the court in Washington on Friday. It asked Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to split the company in two. One company would hold the Windows operating system and the other Microsoft's application programs. The proposal would also impose a range of restrictions on conduct while the breakup is carried out. Two states declined to join in the proposal.</p>
        <p>Microsoft is to file its response by May 10, and will make its formal request for the information and witness testimony. The government says gathering the information can be done in two or three weeks. But while Mr. Neukom said Microsoft earnestly wanted to move the case to the Court of Appeals as soon as possible, he said Microsoft still would need the extra time.</p>
        <p>Of the Microsoft request for discovery, one person close to the government's case said, ''If a person is convicted of bank robbery, does he have the right to find out how the prosecutor came up with his sentence?''</p>
        <p>Microsoft's stock took a beating last week after the government's intention to seek a breakup was reported. But yesterday, in the first trading session since the government plan was formally submitted, the stock rose $3.6875, closing at $73.4375.</p>
        <p>The judge is not obligated to accept Microsoft's request. Judge Jackson has said he wants to complete the remedy phase quickly. Microsoft made a similar request for months of delay to prepare for the opening of the trial two years ago and Judge Jackson rejected it.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft request for more information and for witnesses is just one of the company's tactics in fending off a possible breakup. For example, Microsoft has asserted that the government proposal made expansive claims for the increased competition it says would come from a breakup. Company lawyers call that sheer speculation and Microsoft further says the government ignored the efficiency benefits that come from having one corporation making both Windows and office applications that work within that operating system.</p>
        <p>Robert E. Hall, an economist at Stanford University who advised the Justice Department on an earlier Microsoft case, predicts that the company's lawyers will investigate that issue in court.</p>
        <p>While the proposal is to break the company up, he said the economics were similar to those of two companies in adjacent markets that had merged. And the Justice Department's own guidelines, Mr. Hall notes, call for the government to give relatively more weight to efficiencies in such mergers.</p>
        <p>''There's a thoughtless neglect of efficiencies in the government's analysis, and I think that will be an attractive target for Microsoft,'' Mr. Hall said.</p>
        <p>For its part, Microsoft already argues that the government's breakup proposal would make it far more difficult, if not impossible, for the company to develop innovative products that result from putting together a wide range of software technologies.</p>
        <p>For example, Microsoft's Pocket PC software for handheld computers combines Windows software and technology of the Microsoft suite of business applications called Office in one product. Similarly, its planned computer game product, the X-box, to go on sale next year in competition with Sony, Nintendo and Sega, uses technology from both Microsoft's operating systems and applications divisions.</p>
        <p>But a government official said nothing would prevent the two new companies resulting from a breakup from collaborating on a product in most circumstances, though the proposal does include specific anticollusion provisions.</p>
        <p>The government's plan says the company's software tools programs, used to create other programs, would go to the applications company -- even the developers making tools for Windows. That might seem to be an inefficient step, but it may not be the wayward move it seems, according to some computer experts.</p>
        <p>Prof. Michael Cusumano at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, co-author of ''Microsoft Secrets,'' said there was already a lively market for makers of Windows development tools. Though skeptical that the government proposal would bring much new competition, Mr. Cusumano was also unconvinced by some of Microsoft's arguments that the software industry would suffer from lost efficiency.</p>
        <p>''There will be enormous incentives for the two companies to work together,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Along with those arguments, Brad Smith, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, has extensively researched previous antitrust cases and said none of them offers a clear parallel.</p>
        <p>In Friday's proposal, and in public statements since then, Justice Department officials pointed to the breakup of AT&amp;T as a precedent. But Mr. Smith argued today that the precedent was two sided.</p>
        <p>While AT&amp;T was broken up as part of a settlement in 1984, the government also lifted decades of regulations that had controlled AT&amp;T's business practices. ''And it was that antiregulatory aspect of the decree that allowed AT&amp;T enter new markets and grow,'' Mr. Smith said, ''while this proposal puts into place many regulatory restrictions on our behavior.''</p>
        <p>A government official noted, however, that some new regulations were also imposed on AT&amp;T and its former subsidiaries in 1984, many of which remain in place today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neukom also pointed to another piece of research from Mr. Smith's work. ''Never,'' he said, ''has there been a litigated antitrust case at the end of which a federal court has been asked to order the divestiture'' of part of a unified company.</p>
        <p>In all of the previous cases, he and Mr. Smith said, the government split up a company along clear divisional lines -- AT&amp;T and its local phone companies, Paramount Pictures and its chain of movie theaters.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, in contrast, is a single company with different products but less clear internal divisions. The government asserts, however, that the proposed split falls across a clear divisional line at Microsoft.</p>
