        <p>Concern is spreading among relief organizations that the American Red Cross may be on the verge of withdrawing from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies because the umbrella organization has not agreed to admit immediately an Israeli contingent under a Star of David flag.</p>
        <p>The American Red Cross, under its president, Dr. Bernadine Healy, who took office in July, has withheld $5 million in dues from the federation in Geneva. Relief experts say that was a significant blow to the organization from its largest member. The federation is a secretariat for 176 national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies worldwide.</p>
        <p>The issue of American participation in the international federation is expected to be raised at a national conference of the American Red Cross from May 19 to 21. Requests for comment from the American Red Cross headquarters in Washington were not answered today.</p>
        <p>American contributions of $350,000 are also being withheld from the International Committee of the Red Cross, an independent Swiss-based organization that works with civilians in battle areas and visits prisoners of war, among other functions.</p>
        <p>Red Cross and Red Crescent societies work on disaster relief. The two organizations, although sharing the general goals of one humanitarian movement, are not related in any organizational way.</p>
        <p>Dr. Healy, a former director of the National Institutes of Health who replaced Elizabeth Dole as president, gave almost immediate priority to a campaign for membership for the Magen David Adom, or Red Shield of David, an organization whose emblem is a six-pointed star. Red Cross officials say it was the United States, not Israel, that pressed the case strenuously in meetings this year.</p>
        <p>Last month in Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the federation and government representatives reopened discussion on a neutral emblem that could serve as an alternative for those countries -- not only Israel -- that did not want to use the red cross or red crescent symbols. In the minds of many, those symbols are linked with religious affiliations, although the Red Cross contends that its symbol has no sectarian connotations and is just the Swiss flag with colors reversed.</p>
        <p>One neutral symbol suggested in recent years is a red diamond, within whose outline other symbols could be incorporated. But such a step would not be easy to take because the 1949 Geneva conventions would have to be rewritten and a special international conference called. Only three symbols have ever been recognized, the red cross, the crescent and a red lion and sun, which Iran used briefly before the overthrow of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.</p>
        <p>Dr. Healy, who ran an abortive campaign for a Senate seat from Ohio as a Republican in 1994 after President Clinton did not renew her contract at the National Institutes of Health, criticized the inconclusive meeting last month in Geneva and has since renewed a demand for an immediate recognition of the Magen David Adom.</p>
        <p>Her critics in the Red Cross movement, none of whom would agree to be quoted, say that her hard line is related to domestic American politics and that she may be seeking to position herself for another political race by making the relief symbol a high-profile issue.</p>
