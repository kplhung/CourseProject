        <p>After finishing 10th at the 1996 Olympic marathon trials, an effort that brought him little recognition and not enough money to file a tax return, David Morris made a radical change in both his life and his career.</p>
        <p>American distance running was floundering. Morris questioned whether athletes in the United States were dedicated enough, willing to run punishing miles in training, to regain their competitiveness in an event dominated by Africans, Japanese, Europeans and Mexicans. So he moved to Japan in May of 1997, began running with a corporate-sponsored team and trained up to 176 miles a week, 25 to 50 miles more than conventional workouts.</p>
        <p>He was largely unknown, so it stunned the American running community last October when Morris finished fourth at the Chicago Marathon in 2 hours 9 minutes 32 seconds. That time is considered the official American record because it was run on a certified loop course; however, most people consider Bob Kempainen's 2:08:47, run at the 1994 Boston Marathon, a point-to-point course, to be the real national record.</p>
        <p>Even so, Morris has emerged as a bright exception to a generally bleak American distance landscape. He and Joe LeMay enter Sunday's Olympic trials in Pittsburgh as the only American marathoners to have achieved the ''A'' qualifying standard of 2:14 for the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>''I kind of felt Americans were missing something as far as training goes,'' Morris, who will be 30 on May 17, said yesterday on a conference call, explaining why he moved to Japan. ''Everyone says Americans are soft.''</p>
        <p>There is much uncertainty about Sunday's race, given the potentially hot weather, Pittsburgh's hilly course and the unsettled status of Khalid Khannouchi, the marathon world record-holder from Morocco who is trying to gain American citizenship. Harry Gee, Khannouchi's Houston-based lawyer, said in a recent interview that he was optimistic that Khannouchi would have his citizenship by Thursday. However, marathon officials said privately that Khannouchi may not run because of a sore hamstring and ankle aggravated during a third-place finish at the London Marathon on April 16.</p>
        <p>''If he's a citizen, he should be entitled to run,'' Morris said of Khannouchi, who set the world record of 2:05:42 at Chicago last fall. ''I would just run to make the team pretty much. I'm not going to chase after him.''</p>
        <p>Given the tattered state of American distance running, Morris said he thought it could become a trend, with international athletes gaining American citizenship and supplanting American-born runners in major events.</p>
        <p>''Our culture and lifestyle aren't conducive to distance running,'' said Morris, who has a degree in computer science from the University of Montana. ''People don't want to work hard at running and make a long-term commitment. They want to take a tech job and make money. People from less fortunate countries come here, work hard and can make a lot of money and can make the national team.''</p>
        <p>Going to Japan to train for an Olympic marathon is not without precedent. A Japan-based Kenyan named Eric Wainaina finished third at the Atlanta Olympics. Morris settled in Hamamatsu, about 200 miles southwest of Tokyo, where he was sponsored in a group of 18 runners by Honda. He was paid a salary that required him to make an appearance for half a day at the Honda factory, where he mostly studied Japanese and answered e-mail messages. Essentially, the sinecure allowed him to focus on his training.</p>
        <p>While Americans often concentrate on speed training, the Japanese are more geared to endurance training -- higher mileage and longer tempo runs. An average week consisted of 100-120 miles, but one week a month, the group trained three times a day for a total of 140 to 160 to 176 miles, with tempo runs of 12.5 miles to 30 miles, Morris said. It took six months before he could make it through the workouts at the required speed, and a year before the training began to result in improved racing times. ''Mentally I'm a lot tougher in having three years of 100 miles a week in my legs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In February, Morris returned to the United States, where he lives frugally with a friend in Missoula, Mont., and has shuttled to altitude in New Mexico every few weeks, not having a house of his own. He grew up in Eagle River, Alaska, a suburb of Anchorage, where he avoided video games and walked a mile to school. He coaches himself, and on Sunday, he will learn whether his unusual methods have made him an Olympian.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen myself as having a desk job,'' Morris said. ''I've always been good at running. When I was 10th in the '96 trials, I knew if I got in real good training, it would be my turn to make the team in 2000.''</p>
