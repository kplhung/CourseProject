        <p>Almost any resident of this village can tick off the seemingly endless string of superlatives about the great lake -- inland sea, really -- that laps insistently against the town docks. Lake Baikal is the biggest, the oldest, by far the deepest, the clearest lake on earth.</p>
        <p>Were it empty, all of the world's rivers would have to flow for an entire year to fill it. It has more than 1,500 plants and animals found nowhere else, including the world's only purely freshwater seal.</p>
        <p>But press a resident to say what he loves most about Baikal, and he may cast his lot with the nondescript, gray, oily, foot-long fish that dwells therein.</p>
        <p>Siberians love the lowly omul. They love it fried, dried, smoked, baked, grilled, salted, stuffed, with internals and without internals, with and without scales. Residents of the eastern shore even like it slightly decayed -- ''with odor,'' they call it.</p>
        <p>In warm weather, which is to say above freezing, they sell it from dozens of roadside stands along the shore, their portable cookers belching the smoke of burning alder, with rows of cured fish on the tables waiting to be wrapped in newspaper and carried away.</p>
        <p>''The stands are a relatively new thing,'' said one 31-year-old omul-hawker, who would identify himself only as Mikhail. ''In Soviet times you could hardly find any fish. The rumor was always that the catch went under a contract to Czechoslovakia.''</p>
        <p>''Some days we sell a hundred, some days 10,'' he added. ''It depends on the weather.''</p>
        <p>Life has not been kind to the little fish, a distant cousin of the lake herring that inhabits the Great Lakes. Experts at the Russian Academy of Science's Institute of Limnology -- limnology is the study of lakes -- say the population has risen and fallen in tandem with wars, famines and other events that forced people to turn to this reliable food supply.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's fishermen took so many omul that netting them was briefly banned. When a hydroelectric dam was built on the Angara River, Baikal's only outlet, the lake rose, causing a change in water temperature that led to a drastic decline in the fry that are the omul's main meal. One result has been a smaller and, presumably, hungrier omul than in past decades.</p>
        <p>Still, it remains the lake's most abundant fish. Up to 150,000 tons of omul live there, although the numbers are said to have declined in recent years, and the government limits the annual take to 10,000 tons.</p>
        <p>Served in a decent restaurant, the omul's abundant, light gray meat tastes not unlike flounder, bland and only slightly fishy. Smoked, it acquires an almost sweet flavor.</p>
        <p>But to an outsider the omul's main selling point seems to be not taste but price. Just about any stand will sell one, smoked until its cellophane-thin skin turns golden, for between 7 and 15 rubles -- about 25 to 50 cents -- depending on its size.</p>
        <p>The wharf at Listvyanka, the main stopping point for travelers from the nearby big cities of Irkutsk and Angarsk, is prime territory for the omul merchants, and it appears to be flourishing. On the steep hill behind the shore, steam baths and vacation homes have sprung up with spectacular views of the snowcapped Khamar-Daban mountains to the east, across 30 miles of water.</p>
        <p>The dozen or so omul sellers who have set up their smokers and tables on the wharf said they were increasingly visited by German, Japanese and American tourists. But one day recently, a cold wind blew in off the ice-covered lake and customers were few and far between, so they entertained a visitor with some of the more exotic omul recipes.</p>
        <p>There is raw salted omul: the fish is placed in a pile of salt, organs intact, and left for 12 hours before being washed and eaten. And there is pressed omul, in which layers of salt and gutted omul are alternated, lasagna-style. There is hot-smoked omul, roasted for 40 minutes, and cold-smoked omul, bathed in cool alder smoke for three days. Lightly salted and dried -- its innards are pried open and exposed to the air with tiny matchstick-size crossbeams -- ''you can take it anywhere,'' one merchant said. ''It will last forever.''</p>
        <p>Although the overwhelming preference is for gutted fish, some customers prefer hot-smoked omul with the organs intact, and they generally wolf it down, scales and all.</p>
        <p>''They like it with organs because it's juicier that way,'' said Yana Borodina, 23, who tended one table.</p>
        <p>And finally, there is omul ''s dushkom'' -- with odor -- the delicacy of Baikal's mountainous eastern shore and a traditional dish of the Buryat, the Mongol-related people who live there.</p>
        <p>The recipe is fairly simple: catch an omul, place it in warm sunlight until it begins to smell -- generally 10 to 20 minutes -- and eat it, scales, organs and all. ''Each according to his taste,'' a grimacing Ms. Borodina said, then told a joke: it seems that a man from the east went into a market and asked the owner, ''Is the fish fresh?''</p>
        <p>''Of course,'' the owner said. ''In that case,'' the man replied, ''I'll go somewhere else.''</p>
