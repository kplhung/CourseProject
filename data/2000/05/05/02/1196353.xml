        <p>The registered nurses at Nyack Hospital overwhelmingly rejected a proposed new contract and vowed tonight to continue their four-month-old strike against the hospital, in Rockland County.</p>
        <p>The contract, which would have given the nurses a 10 percent raise over five years and a say in establishing nurse-patient ratios but which called for a giveback of five sick days, was defeated by a ratio of more than 2 to 1.</p>
        <p>''It was the sick days and the low salary,'' said Mark Genovese, spokesman for the New York State Association of Nurses, which represents 33,000 nurses statewide. ''The hospital needs to present a more competitive package if they want to keep from losing staff.''</p>
        <p>Hospital officials said they would immediately move forward in the process of replacing the striking nurses, by running a national recruitment and advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>''It's puzzling to us,'' said Nancy Kriz, a spokeswoman for Nyack Hospital. ''We really did our best to reach an agreement. We bargained in good faith and I believe the union bargained in good faith, too.</p>
        <p>''The union said they would recommend it to their membership, but the membership obviously voted it down.''</p>
        <p>The nurses have been on strike since Dec. 21, when contract talks broke down.</p>
        <p>Each day of the strike nurses picketed in front of the red-brick hospital, drawing honks of support from passing drivers, while inside the 375-bed hospital, care was provided by temporary nurses hired through an agency in Colorado.</p>
        <p>The voting, at the Best Western Motel in Nyack, ended at 9 o'clock tonight.</p>
        <p>Under the existing contract, which expired in December 1997, nurses started at an annual salary of $42,500 and reached a top salary of $61,400 after 18 years.</p>
        <p>Before negotiations broke down in December, the hospital proposed a merit pay scale that would have given all the nurses a raise of 10 percent over five years, and some nurses as much as 22 percent over five years.</p>
        <p>The nurses balked at the notion of merit pay, with union leaders saying that a good nurse who is a strong patient advocate but an annoyance to the hospital administration would get lower evaluation ratings and smaller raises.</p>
        <p>Under the rejected contract proposal, the merit pay option would have been replaced by a bonus system.</p>
        <p>Nurses who got good evaluations and met certain criteria could have received annual bonuses of up to 1.5 percent of their salary under the proposal.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest points of contention during the strike has been whether to add a clause to the contract specifying a nurse-to-patient ratio for the various hospital wards. The proposed contract called for a team made up equally of management and nurses to establish nurse-to-patient ratios based on the severity of the illnesses of the patients.</p>
        <p>This is the third time in seven years that the nurses have been on strike at Nyack Hospital. In 1993, they went on strike for six and a half hours when contract negotiations took longer than expected. In 1995, a 26-day strike, called because the hospital wanted to eliminate all 12-hour shifts, ended in a compromise.</p>
