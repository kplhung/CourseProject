        <p>The Jets yesterday signed one player they hope will help fill the void left by Keyshawn Johnson while Bill Parcells, the director of football operations, dampened speculation that the team might acquire Carl Pickens.</p>
        <p>The Jets signed their third-round draft pick, receiver Laveranues Coles of Florida State, to a three-year deal worth almost $1.3 million. Coach Al Groh praised Coles's speed -- the Jets clocked him in 4.6 seconds in the 40-yard dash -- and he has good size (5 feet 11 inches and 190 pounds), making him a threat to go over the middle. He made a spectacular one-handed catch during last weekend's rookie camp.</p>

        <p>The Jets yesterday signed one player they hope will help fill the void left by Keyshawn Johnson while Bill Parcells, the director of football operations, dampened speculation that the team might acquire Carl Pickens.</p>
        <p>The Jets signed their third-round draft pick, receiver Laveranues Coles of Florida State, to a three-year deal worth almost $1.3 million. Coach Al Groh praised Coles's speed -- the Jets clocked him in 4.6 seconds in the 40-yard dash -- and he has good size (5 feet 11 inches and 190 pounds), making him a threat to go over the middle. He made a spectacular one-handed catch during last weekend's rookie camp.</p>
        <p>Coles, though, lugs plenty of baggage from a checkered career at Florida State that was filled with legal trouble. He was thrown off the team as a senior last season after being involved with a fellow receiver, Peter Warrick, in a department store scam. The university had placed Coles on probation for a variety of other legal and academic problems. He played only four games in 1999, but in 35 college games, he caught 62 passes for 1,084 yards.</p>
        <p>Parcells said yesterday that it was highly unlikely the Jets would acquire Pickens -- either through a trade or through free agency if he is released by the Bengals as expected. Pickens's contract with Cincinnati calls for a $3 million base salary this year. Parcells -- appearing at a promotional event for the Cadillac N.F.L. Golf Classic, to be played June 19-25 at the Upper Montclair Country Club -- hinted that the Jets could not afford to pay that much.</p>
        <p>The Jets have the daunting task of trying to sign four first-round draft picks within salary cap constraints.</p>
        <p>Vinny Testaverde, also at the golf event, said that Pickens would fit right in with the Jets.</p>
        <p>''I had the chance to work with him at the Pro Bowl,'' Testaverde said. ''He's a real nice guy and a good target. He's a guy who could step right in and fill that spot.''</p>
        <p>But Testaverde may be comforted by what else Parcells said. While being coy on the subject of his future, Parcells implied he might not be retiring this summer, as has long been expected.</p>
        <p>''All I'm saying is that the only ones who ever said I was leaving was the media,'' Parcells said. ''I never had any timetable.''</p>
        <p>So, is he undecided about his plans? ''I didn't say that,'' Parcells responded.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>VINNY TESTAVERDE said Monday that he was not 100 percent recovered from his Achilles' tendon injury but that he could play today if there were a game. Asked what his first big test would be, Testaverde said: ''It's going to be the first live game, preseason. When I have to take off, step up, put pressure on it and get away.'' . . . The Jets signed the rookie free-agent linebacker BRENT NACCARA from Maine. Naccara, who was at the rookie camp on a tryout, is a native of Hewitt, N.J., and went to West Milford High School. The Jets waived the rookie free-agent guard SEMISI HEIMULI and defensive tackle DAN GIBBONS.</p>
