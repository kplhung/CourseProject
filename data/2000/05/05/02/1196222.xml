        <p>Classical ballet and jitterbugging were happy dancing partners when the Ohio Ballet presented ''Kings of Swing'' on Sunday afternoon at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College. The production was a high-spirited trilogy of ballets, each by a different choreographer, featuring recorded jazz and swing music.</p>
        <p>Donald Byrd got the afternoon off to a wonderfully outrageous start with his ''Ellington Phantasia,'' to pieces by Duke Ellington. Mr. Byrd was inspired by the lavish and often corny production numbers that were a part of many old musical films and Broadway revues and musical comedies. This phantasia, as he called it, was truly an extravaganza, both in its choreography and the gaudy costumes that A. Christina Giannini must have had fun designing.</p>

        <p>Classical ballet and jitterbugging were happy dancing partners when the Ohio Ballet presented ''Kings of Swing'' on Sunday afternoon at the Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts at Brooklyn College. The production was a high-spirited trilogy of ballets, each by a different choreographer, featuring recorded jazz and swing music.</p>
        <p>Donald Byrd got the afternoon off to a wonderfully outrageous start with his ''Ellington Phantasia,'' to pieces by Duke Ellington. Mr. Byrd was inspired by the lavish and often corny production numbers that were a part of many old musical films and Broadway revues and musical comedies. This phantasia, as he called it, was truly an extravaganza, both in its choreography and the gaudy costumes that A. Christina Giannini must have had fun designing.</p>
        <p>Each scene had its own flavor. First, fashionable people in formal attire aggressively attracted attention with their sharp thrusting movements. ''Look how stylish we are!'' their gestures exclaimed.</p>
        <p>Next dancers in plumed headdresses jumped their way through antic ceremonies like members of some imaginary tribe. Then priests wearing golden masks forced Xochitl Tejeda de Cerda to leap from a Mayan pyramid as if she were a sacrificial victim. Finally dancers in Chinese costumes hopped about at a breakneck pace.</p>
        <p>The scenes were historically and anthropologically preposterous. Yet  Mr. Byrd evoked an earlier era of show business and put on a sassy good show of his own.</p>
        <p>Ms. Giannini adopted a more restrained palette of blacks, whites and grays in her costumes for ''In Full Swing,'' a suite to Benny Goodman choreographed by Heinz Poll, who founded the Akron-based troupe in 1968. Brisk ensembles opened and closed the ballet, and there were effective vignettes for small casts.</p>
        <p>Matthew Keefe, wearing top hat and tails, jauntily courted Kathleen Nanni and Anitra Nurnberger. At first glance, the top-hatted dancer who followed this trio appeared to be another man. But it was really a woman (Ms. Tejeda de Cerda) who danced a ruminative solo, after which Mr. Keefe joined her in a duet that began in a slightly sultry fashion, broadened into high lifts and ended with a tender embrace.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Graham Hughes, who succeeded Mr. Poll as artistic director last year, contributed ''Shakin' Not Stirred,'' to recordings by Ellington, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Ella Fitzgerald, Dizzy Gillespie, the Brian Setzer Orchestra and Tito Puente. Victor Montez Temple and Jeremy Lemme had a friendly athletic competition. The work literally became a ''swing'' ballet when Zuri Goldman kept swinging Ms. Nurnberger through the air. Ms. Tejeda de Cerda portrayed an enticing woman who was languid one moment and unpredictably effervescent the next. And throughout the work, bits of jitterbugging and jazzy hip wiggling were the pleasant adornments of a choreographic structure with an essentially balletic base.</p>
        <p>Because ''Kings of Swing'' was an entire program to short recorded selections, it was occasionally bedeviled by structural sameness. But the breezy dancers managed to chase the aesthetic blues away.</p>
