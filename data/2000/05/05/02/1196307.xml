        <p>Microsoft plans to ask the federal judge overseeing the antitrust case against it for authority to obtain hundreds of pages of government records and for permission to summon witnesses to argue that the proposed division of the software giant into two companies is unwarranted.</p>
        <p>Government officials called the request a stalling tactic, possibly intended to delay the ruling until the next administration takes office.</p>
        <p>But the company denied that intent and said the extremeness of the government's proposal to split the company in two invited questions about how it had arrived at that idea. The company's general counsel said the effort to gather the information could last into the fall, and outside experts said Microsoft might not gain any particular advantage from a delay.
