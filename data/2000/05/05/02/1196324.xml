        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Even Doctor-Patient Relationships Can Be Dysfunctional,'' (April 25):</p>
        <p>I was once the victim of a medical ''bad fit.'' A chronic asthmatic, I was assigned by my H.M.O. to a ''preventive medicine specialist,'' who tended to dismiss my worries with remarks like ''you don't get enough exercise'' and ''you take too many antibiotics.''</p>
        <p>I had been asthmatic for 37 years and was well-qualified to monitor my own condition.</p>
        <p>Once, my doctor insisted that because I had had an antibiotic six months earlier, I didn't need one then.</p>
        <p>So I ended up in the emergency room for asthma treatment for the first time since I was a very small child.</p>
        <p>The expense of this visit made the H.M.O. quite amenable to my insistence the next day that I never have to see this doctor ever again and that I be assigned to a pulmonologist.</p>
        <p>Clearly, we had a classic mismatch: a patient who needed to be taken seriously, and a doctor who didn't understand the parameters of her condition.</p>
        <p>And, my much more experienced and sensitive pulmonologist has treated my asthma with great success.</p>
