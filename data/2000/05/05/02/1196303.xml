        <p>THE Toronto Maple Leafs have their own burden of failure, their personal cross to bear, without taking on an entire country's as well.

        <p>THE Toronto Maple Leafs have their own burden of failure, their personal cross to bear, without taking on an entire country's as well. Thirty-three years without a Stanley Cup or even a trip to the finals is well along the road to other droughts of lore, but there can be no getting around the inescapable and nationalistic truth.</p>
        <p>The drying-out of Canada as a once bottomless well of National Hockey League champions illuminates the Leafs as the last team from north of the border not to go south before the second round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>This is not to confuse Edmonton and Ottawa, the only other qualifying Canadian teams this season, with those erstwhile outfits from Winnipeg and Quebec that have actually emigrated deep into Nielsen Land, or any others trying to resist the bottom-line urge. But those teams are also part of the wagon-train reality of N.H.L. 2000, the slow and sad expatriation of the Canadian game.</p>
        <p>''Sure, there is a more nationalistic approach around us because the economics have affected the ability of the Canadian teams to compete,'' said Pat Quinn, the Maple Leafs' coach, before the Devils wasted his team, 5-1, last night at Continental Arena in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals the Devils now lead, 2-1. ''You just hope your players don't feel it.''</p>
        <p>It's doubtful the Leafs are feeling anything more than the frustration of the Devils shutting them out for five straight periods, or until it didn't matter last night. While there was no trademark contrast of styles on a night the Devils opened up and embarrassed Toronto at its own game, there remains the obvious polarity of what and whom these franchises represent.</p>
        <p>If, as Quinn contended, the Leafs are as important to English-speaking Canada as the Yankees are to baseball-worshiping America, then this particular series symbolically boils down to Canadian Yankees versus YankeeNets, the pride of a nation against the identity-challenged, sellout-deprived boys from the 'burbs. It is another battle in the failing holy war to prevent the sport from being ripped from its roots, for the sake of better arena and television deals.</p>
        <p>If the Leafs don't rally, this will be the seventh consecutive year that the Stanley Cup has not spent the off-season on Canadian soil, a record. The six years from 1936 to 1941 matches the current streak, one obliterated by Canada's domination between 1956 and 1990, when it captured 26 of 35 cups.</p>
        <p>Summers up north have been getting colder and drier, with nothing to drink from. After Montreal won in 1993, Quinn's Vancouver Canucks became the last Canadian team of the decade to reach the finals, in 1994.</p>
        <p>''Interest does wane,'' Quinn said, describing the malaise that overtakes Canada as it watches the playoffs sink deeper into America's Sun Belt. It's as if the Expos were playing the Blue Jays every October, and if no radical restructuring of the game's finances is done, Quinn agreed the possibility exists that Toronto and Montreal, the original Canadian two, could eventually be the only two left.</p>
        <p>In Vancouver, the 1994 run to Game 7 in Madison Square Garden already feels as dated as it does in New York (for different reasons). ''They've had staggering losses over the last two years,'' Quinn said. ''What can you do? The players get a disproportionate share of the money. It's not their fault. We give it to them.''</p>
        <p>With more Americans and Europeans in the N.H.L., there is less sentiment for smaller Canadian markets. Even Garry Valk, the Leafs left wing who grew up in Edmonton and deplores the negativism he hears every summer at home in Vancouver, said he doubts many Canadian players would resent more teams relocating to the States.</p>
        <p>The players have become conditioned by the owners and the league marketing gurus who pose as front-office visionaries and measure the soul of a sport by the dollar it turns.</p>
        <p>''You can't compare what Calgary can offer to what an Anaheim can,'' Valk said. ''It's that way in baseball, and it's that way in hockey.''</p>
        <p>For what it's worth, Valk and Tie Domi said they and their teammates pulled for Montreal and Vancouver as those teams made unsuccessful late-season playoff runs. ''You want to see as many Canadian teams as possible because they need the postseason revenue,'' Valk said. ''It's good for hockey.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, what players root for bears little consequence to what they'll sign for. American cities with little hockey orientation have greater revenue potential, foretelling a day when Canada's string of cup-less years could be as long as the Leafs'.</p>
