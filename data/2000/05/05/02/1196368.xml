        <p>The Rangers' season ended on April 9, without a playoff appearance for the third consecutive year. But the Rangers' top minor-league affiliate, Hartford, is still going strong.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Hartford wrapped up its A.H.L. quarterfinal series, 4 games to 1, with a 2-0 shutout of Worcester. And now, the Wolf Pack can expect Pavel Brendl, the highly touted 19-year-old right wing from the Czech Republic, to join them for the A.H.L. semifinals.</p>
        <p>Brendl's junior-league career ended Saturday night with the Calgary Hitmen's 6-5 overtime loss to Kootenay in the Western Hockey League semifinals. Brendl, the Rangers' first pick in last summer's draft (fourth over all), contributed three assists in the Game 5 defeat, as Kootenay pulled off the upset, 4 games to 1. In 10 playoff games, Brendl has scored 7 goals and had 12 assists.</p>
        <p>For Calgary this season, Brendl scored 59 goals in 61 games to lead the W.H.L. by 9 goals. In two junior-league seasons with Calgary, Brendl had 132 goals in 129 games.</p>
        <p>Brendl had been penciled into the Rangers' opening-day lineup last fall. But he reported to his first National Hockey League training camp out of shape.</p>
        <p>Brendl has agreed to report to the Rangers' practice facility in Rye, N.Y., on July 1 to work out with the training staff in preparation for training camp this fall.</p>
