        <p>Two New York City hospitals and a group of primary care clinics have agreed to provide interpreters for patients who are deaf, to avoid a federal lawsuit accusing them of violating the Americans With Disabilities Act.</p>
        <p>The consent agreement, which was filed yesterday in the United States Courts for the Eastern and Southern Districts, is believed to be among the broadest of its kind.</p>
        <p>The state attorney general's office said it had investigated complaints from deaf and hearing-impaired patients who said they had not been able to understand health care workers and had been denied interpreters, and decided to focus on those centers where the complaints were most numerous.</p>
        <p>The institutions that entered into an agreement with the state are  Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, New York Community Hospital in Brooklyn and the seven primary care centers run by United Medical Associates in Brooklyn. Each center signed the agreement. An agreement with a similar primary care umbrella group is pending upstate, officials said.</p>
        <p>Rather than face a lawsuit, the institutions agreed to a vast array of conditions, including a promise to provide interpreters more or less on demand for patients who request them.</p>
        <p>''This is the broadest consent decree we have seen,'' said the attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer. ''This is an agreement we hope will become a template for other institutions that have similarly failed to be as accommodating as is called for under the A.D.A.''</p>
        <p>According to the complaints, deaf patients were often erroneously told that they were not entitled to interpreters or that they should bring their own. The disabilities act requires employers and institutions to provide accessible services to people with disabilities.</p>
        <p>In one case, a deaf woman who could not speak sought treatment in the emergency room of a hospital that the attorney general's office would not identify. Unable to communicate with hospital workers, she was told that she was well and was sent home, where she later had a miscarriage.</p>
        <p>''She was bleeding profusely and asked for a sign language interpreter,'' said Hilary Klein, an assistant attorney general. ''She had no idea what was going on. She was told she was fine and to go home. No one was called. It was communicated to her that she was fine.''</p>
        <p>In another case, a man with serious eye problems who needed surgery was told that he should ask his daughter, who lived in Pennsylvania and had accompanied him on previous medical appointments, to move back to New York, Ms. Klein said. Other cases included women who were unable to understand the dosage for medications for their children.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the agreement, the hospitals and doctors' offices will have to provide an interpreter for people who cannot hear within an hour of their arrival. If a patient gives more than two hours' notice, the interpreter must be available when he or she arrives. The only exception is for Montefiore during nights, weekends and holidays, when patients will be required to give four hours' notice to have an interpreter available on arrival.</p>
        <p>The centers must also either contract with a company that provides interpreters, or hire someone whose job description would include that role. Interpreters usually charge about $75 an hour, Ms. Klein said. Hospitals must also train their staff to work with deaf people, and provide refresher courses.</p>
        <p>Organizations that represent people who are deaf or hard of hearing have lobbied hard in recent years for similar agreements from medical centers around the country. ''Access to health care is the No. 1 problem that deaf and hard-of-hearing people encounter,'' said Marc Charmatz, director of the National Association of the Deaf Law Center in Silver Spring, Md.</p>
        <p>The health care industry has not been a target of enforcement in recent years, said Laura Rothstein, a professor of law at the University of Houston and an expert on the disabilities act.</p>
        <p>Many health care institutions have had difficulty trying to comply with the law. ''There is real recognition of need for guidance on what is reasonable in terms of interpreters,'' Ms. Rothstein said. ''It is one of the most complex issues, because the service that is needed is both costly and not necessarily available. It is not reasonable to expect 24-hour-a-day sign language interpreters to be available, and health providers want the guidelines.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Department of Justice pressed health care centers in Connecticut to provide interpreters, although with less stringent requirements than Mr. Spitzer's.</p>
        <p>Many centers have wanted to avoid the high cost of interpreters, or have considered themselves exempt.</p>
        <p>''We felt the law does not cover private offices,'' said Dr. Paul De Stefano, president of United Medical Associates, one of the largest primary care networks in Brooklyn. ''But more or less we all feel that the disabilities act is appropriate, so we reached this agreement and we plan to implement it.''</p>
        <p>Irving Ballen, a lawyer representing New York Community Hospital, said the agreement ''speaks for itself.'' He added that he did not think that Community Hospital was one of the most egregious violators in the city. A spokesman for Montefiore, in a statement, said, ''Montefiore Medical Center has long been committed to serving its patients with special needs and has had policies in place to address the needs of the deaf and hearing impaired.''</p>
