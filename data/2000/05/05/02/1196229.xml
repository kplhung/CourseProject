        <p>Ute Lemper built her career on songs from the past. She is a poised, fierce, mercurial performer of Berlin cabaret songs from the Weimar era, when decadence and sophistication fell under the shadow of Nazism and impending war. But for her new album, ''Punishing Kiss'' (Decca/ Universal), she turned to living songwriters.</p>
        <p>She got songs from Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Nick Cave and the English group the Divine Comedy -- musicians who, like Ms. Lemper, are children of the rock era yet admire the musical and dramatic convolutions of the European cabaret tradition. Her newer material doesn't have the political undertow of her Berlin repertory; most of the songs are about love affairs that don't promise happy endings.</p>

        <p>Ute Lemper built her career on songs from the past. She is a poised, fierce, mercurial performer of Berlin cabaret songs from the Weimar era, when decadence and sophistication fell under the shadow of Nazism and impending war. But for her new album, ''Punishing Kiss'' (Decca/ Universal), she turned to living songwriters.</p>
        <p>She got songs from Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Nick Cave and the English group the Divine Comedy -- musicians who, like Ms. Lemper, are children of the rock era yet admire the musical and dramatic convolutions of the European cabaret tradition. Her newer material doesn't have the political undertow of her Berlin repertory; most of the songs are about love affairs that don't promise happy endings.</p>
        <p>Her old and new repertories shared her program at Town Hall on Friday night, and Ms. Lemper pounced on every song as both singer and actress. There's never anything tentative about her interpretations. Each song becomes a five-minute visitation from characters who can be sultry, wrathful, capricious and desperate.</p>
        <p>Singing a vampire's song, she vamped with a feather boa, slinked down into the audience and swooped onto a listener's neck; singing ''Streets of Berlin'' by Philip Glass and Martin Sherman, she started out as a lonely waif, built to a witchy howl of despair, then dropped back a whispered, hollow-eyed ''Will you miss me?'' The Divine Comedy's ''You Were Meant for Me'' became a stalker's tango, with Ms. Lemper growing more insistent as it became clearer that her love would stay unrequited.</p>
        <p>In her past repertory, Ms. Lemper already held the voices of embittered jades, all-too-knowing bystanders, giggly girls and brokenhearted lovers. Now, she has picked up the unfettered power of rock belters. She has no problem suddenly bouncing a song up to the next octave, or shifting from a sweet romantic declaration to its caustic aftermath.</p>
        <p>But unlike her older repertory, in which she transcends impersonations of Marlene Dietrich or Lotte Lenya with her finely calibrated melodrama, her rock-era songs sometimes leave her simply mimicking Barbra Streisand or Ann Wilson of Heart. Yet in ''Little Water Song'' by Mr. Cave and Bruno Pisek, she pulled off a daring reversal, starting with Streisand-style belting and easing down to ethereal tenderness as her character's consciousness slowly dissolved.</p>
        <p>Still, extending her repertory toward the present turned out to be easier than trying to update older songs. In two Kurt Weill tunes, her band exchanged the old German oompah for circa-1970's midtempo funk, losing their rhythmic wit as they grew cluttered. Ms. Lemper has done well at connecting eras; there's no need for her to scramble them.</p>
