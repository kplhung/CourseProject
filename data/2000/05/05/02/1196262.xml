        <p>Lehman Brothers, a major source of financing for lenders catering to customers with less than perfect credit, was sued yesterday as part of a class-action suit filed against the First Alliance Corporation, a national mortgage lender in Irvine, Calif.</p>

        <p>Lehman Brothers, a major source of financing for lenders catering to customers with less than perfect credit, was sued yesterday as part of a class-action suit filed against the First Alliance Corporation, a national mortgage lender in Irvine, Calif.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit was filed in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif., by the San Francisco law firm of Jenkins &amp; Mulligan, one of several firms representing homeowners who had received home-equity loans from the First Alliance Mortgage Company, the corporation's flagship unit.</p>
        <p>William J. Ahearn, a spokesman for Lehman Brothers, said last night that the company had not seen the new lawsuit and that he could not comment on it. But in the past, Lehman Brothers staunchly denied any wrongdoing in connection with its financing of First Alliance.</p>
        <p>First Alliance filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March while facing a long roster of civil and regulatory lawsuits that accused it of using deceptive sales practices to draw homeowners into high-cost loans that drained away the wealth they had tied up in their homes.</p>
        <p>First Alliance had denied the accusations, insisting that homeowners were fully informed about the terms of their loans. Under federal court rules, those consumer lawsuits have been frozen by the company's bankruptcy filing, although some state regulatory actions are proceeding in Illinois and Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>The mortgage company, which once had offices in more than a dozen states was one of many so-called subprime mortgage lenders who relied on Lehman both for lines of credit and for capital.</p>
        <p>As recently as last fall, Lehman had raised more than $100 million for First Alliance despite the accusations of predatory lending that had been made against the mortgage company in dozens of lawsuits filed by AARP, homeowners and state regulators. Those lawsuits were fully disclosed to investors in the securities that Lehman sold.</p>
        <p>The complaint filed yesterday repeats many of the consumer fraud allegations already made against First Alliance. But it additionally argues that Lehman Brothers provided the funds that allowed First Alliance and its subsidiaries ''to continue their fraudulent lending practices.''</p>
        <p>The investment bank, the complaint argues, ''had knowledge of the fraudulent practices described above and tacitly or expressly approved those practices in its financing of the lending operations.'' The complaint added, ''absent this approval, First Alliance's fraudulent loans team would not have been possible.''</p>
