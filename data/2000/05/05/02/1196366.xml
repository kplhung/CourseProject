        <p>It is not exactly a team in transition, Coach April Heinrichs acknowledges, but the United States women's national team is likely to be transformed after the coming Olympics in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>''I think it's premature to say that there will be a changing of the guard now,'' Heinrichs said. ''But the new guard is coming to the door.''</p>
        <p>As the person who replaced Tony DiCicco as coach after the United States won the World Cup last summer, Heinrichs has ushered some young players to that door.</p>
        <p>Among the 18 players named to the American roster for the Nike U.S. Women's Cup (which begins on Friday in Portland, Ore.) are five women who might not make it to Australia this summer but could play important roles in the future.</p>
        <p>After that tournament, which opens for the United States with a game against Mexico in the second game of a doubleheader and also includes Canada and South Korea, the Americans will travel to Australia at the end of the month for the six-nation Pacific Cup. In late June, the United States will play host to the Gold Cup. Heinrichs also plans a trip to Europe and four or five more pre-Olympic matches before naming the final Olympic roster, probably before the end of July.</p>
        <p>Heinrichs has been particularly impressed with the play of two young goalkeepers: Siri Mullinix, 22, who has emerged as the backup to Briana Scurry; and Hope Solo, an 18-year-old native of Richland, Wash., who has played only once in a full international game for the senior team.</p>
        <p>Other newcomers picked for the Nike Cup roster include Christie Welsh, a 19-year-old striker from Massapequa Park, N.Y.; Nandi Pryce, a 17-year-old defender from Casselberry, Fla.; and Niki Serlenga, a 21-year-old midfelder from San Diego.</p>
        <p>Heinrichs has also been impressed with the play of Aly Wagner, a 19-year-old midfielder from San Jose, Calif., and Danielle Slaton, a 19-year-old defender also from San Jose. They are part of the 30-player pool in the team's residency training camp in San Diego.</p>
        <p>''The players, all the players in camp, understand that everyone has a chance to make the Olympic team,'' Heinrichs said. ''The veterans understand that this is their moment in time. Their job is to help teach and train the younger players. And our younger players are well aware of whom they are playing next to. They are not in the comfort zone anymore and probably won't be for the next four or five years with the national team.''</p>
        <p>2006 WORLD CUP</p>
        <p>The bids are in. FIFA's technical committee, led by the American Alan Rothenberg, has visited the five countries involved. What's left is the arm-twisting, politicking and international intrigue before July 6, when the 24-member executive committee of soccer's world governing body is scheduled to vote on where the 2006 World Cup will be played: Germany, England, South Africa, Brazil or Morocco.</p>
        <p>In some quarters, South Africa is the sentimental, and some would say politically correct, choice. The leader of that country's bid, Danny Jordaan, was in New York recently to restate his case before the Football Confederation executive committee. The Football Confederation, formerly known as Concacaf, is the sport's regional governing body in North and Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>''I ran into Danny in Zurich during some FIFA meetings a few weeks ago, and he asked whether he would be able to make a presentation to our committee,'' said the American general secretary of the Football Confederation, Chuck Blazer. ''For a year and a half we have been hearing that in the interests of rotation, the fair choice would be South Africa. I'm interested in seeing the best World Cup, in whatever venue. Of course there are emotional issues, like whether or not the World Cup should be spread around in a rotating fashion. But there's more to it. An African country has never played host to the World Cup.'' The 2002 event will be played in Japan and South Korea.</p>
        <p>Blazer is a member of the FIFA's executive committee and will be in Zurich in July to vote by secret ballot. The country with the fewest votes after each round will be eliminated until a winner is declared.</p>
        <p>Although Blazer said he remained undecided, newspapers in England have identified him as a supporter of England's bid, an assertion he denies.</p>
        <p>''The England bid is an excellent bid,'' Blazer said. ''They have the facilities. I have no issue with England being an appropriate candidate. But this is not an easy matter, particularly because of the nature of the 2002 bid being split between Japan and South Korea. Now it's clear that there are many difficult things about the joint hosting of the World Cup. I want to make sure the next one is superlative, back along the standards of France in 1998.''</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>In a first for Europe, all games in the Bundesliga will be broadcast live in Germany next season, either on pay-per-view or by subscription to the Kirch Premiere World Group, which paid $1.5 billion for its four-year deal. . . . The United States Soccer Federation and Nike unveiled new men's national team uniforms yesterday. The set includes a classic white outfit that drops a horizontal stripe across the chest. They are reminiscent of the famous all-white uniforms worn by Santos of Brazil, Pele's former club.</p>
