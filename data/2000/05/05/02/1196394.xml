        <p>MAHONEY-David J. The faculty and staff of Harvard Medical School mourn the loss of David Mahoney, a generous benefactor and champion of neuroscience research who tirelessly sought to eliminate the stigma associated with mental illness. With his wife Hildegarde, they formed the Harvard Mahoney Neuroscience Institute in 1990 with the goal to educate the lay public about the benefits of brain research. In 1995, the Institute created the David Mahoney Prize to increase public awareness about neuroscience and neurodegenerative diseases. These initiatives leave a legacy that will encourage the finest research and outreach efforts in the field of mental health. Our thoughts are with Hildegarde and Mr. Mahoney's children, David and Barbara. Joseph B. Martin Dean of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine Harvard Medical School</p>
