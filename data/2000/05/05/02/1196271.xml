        <p>Lawyers involved in a case that has dragged through the federal courts for 16 years said today they had reached a tentative settlement concerning charges that the Baltimore public school system had woefully neglected physically and mentally disabled students.</p>
        <p>The settlement sets goals for evaluating children with special needs and for putting special education students into regular classes and calls for annual monitoring.</p>
        <p>What may be most notable, however, is the unusual procedure used to settle the case, which was scheduled to go to trial today. The parties chose a federal judge -- one not involved in the case -- to serve as a mediator.</p>
        <p>Such a procedure, the lawyers and the trial judge said, had been used only once before, and it proved unsuccessful. That occurred this year in the Microsoft antitrust trial. The judge in that case, Thomas Penfield Jackson, asked Richard A. Posner, chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, to mediate the dispute, but his efforts failed to produce a solution.</p>
        <p>In the Baltimore case, both sides agreed in January to ask Judge David S. Tatel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to help them reach a settlement. Lawyers for both sides said today that they were delighted with the results.</p>
        <p>The suit dates to 1984, when the Maryland Disability Law Center sued the city and state, charging that little was being done to accommodate the needs of the estimated 18 percent of the enrollment of slightly more than 100,000 students who qualified for special education. Similar lawsuits have been filed in about a dozen major cities, including New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>At one point in the litigation, the city was so discouraged about its ability to do anything that it came up with the idea of simply giving televisions, videocassette recorders and computers to students to make up for its neglect.</p>
        <p>In his earlier career as a private lawyer in Washington, Judge Tatel represented the Baltimore school board in the case.</p>
        <p>Judge Marvin J. Garbis, who was presiding over the trial, said, ''it has to be a pretty extraordinary person who once sat with the defense'' to be deemed acceptable to both sides.</p>
        <p>But lawyers who were suing the city said they had confidence in Judge Tatel because he had also once been director of the Office for Civil Rights in what was the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.</p>
        <p>Steven Ney, legal director of the disability center, said the settlement ''sets a road map for the ultimate disposition of the case.''</p>
        <p>The courts had ruled that the city and state had neglected children in need of special education, and the last several years have been about how to remedy that. Under the settlement announced today, the federal courts will ''disengage'' from monitoring the city's schools if all the goals are substantially met.</p>
        <p>Among the requirements of the agreement, the school district will have to place nearly 60 percent of the special education students in regular classes, or ''mainstream'' them, in three years. About 40 percent of such students now attend regular classes at some point in the school day.</p>
        <p>The reading gap between special education and other students will have to be narrowed in three years, and there will be annual reporting to a special master, Amy Totenberg.</p>
        <p>Judge Garbis said that while the Microsoft case involved great amounts of money the Baltimore case involved the ''precious resource of our children.'' He led the lawyers in a standing ovation to Judge Tatel, saying, ''the people of Baltimore and its children owe a great deal to Judge Tatel.''</p>
        <p>In addressing the court, Judge Tatel, who was not compensated for his work, said he believed that both sides had achieved their goals. ''They produced an agreement that calls for educationally sound but realistic outcomes that have a good chance of improving the quality of education in the Baltimore public school system.''</p>
