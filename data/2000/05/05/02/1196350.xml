        <p>The first of 13 Jewish men who are accused of espionage went on trial today, and Iranian authorities displayed him on television admitting that he had spied for Israel.</p>
        <p>The defendant, Hamid Tefileen, made the public confession after the government had adamantly refused to allow family members, human rights groups or the public to witness the opening of the politically charged trials of the 13, who are to be tried, one by one, in coming weeks, on vague charges of spying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tefileen, 31, described by his family as a clerk in his father's shoe store, told an interviewer that he was part of a network of spies who were trained in Israel ''to get information from Muslims.''</p>
        <p>The brief question-and-answer session, in which Mr. Tefileen was dressed in prison garb decorated with tiny drawings of the scales of justice, was broadcast on Iran's state-run television as part of the main evening news.</p>
        <p>''I am charged with being a spy for Israel,'' said the defendant, sandwiched between two interviewers in a room that appeared to be in the provincial courthouse here. ''I admit to that charge.''</p>
        <p>His public confession was apparently made without his attorney present. Broadcast hours after court officials had once again insisted that the trial of the Jews must be closed for national security reasons, it did little to convince the foreign envoys who were in Shiraz to see if the Jews receive a fair trial from a court system dominated by hard-liners hostile to the West.</p>
        <p>''My gut feeling is, it's a setup,'' said Vicken Koundakjian, first secretary in the Canadian embassy in Tehran and one of five diplomatic observers who had appealed to the judge in the case for permission to meet with the defendants. ''He's a fall guy.''</p>
        <p>The judge's decision two weeks ago to conduct the espionage trial behind closed doors had drawn intense criticism from human rights groups and diplomats, who argued that only an open proceeding could assure that the defendants were not bullied or persecuted.</p>
        <p>''We don't believe a TV confession,'' said Elahe Hicks, a representative of Human Rights Watch in New York, who is in Shiraz to monitor the trial. ''It's a violation of detainees' rights. If they wanted to show him, they should have allowed a representative of the Jewish community, or diplomats or even me, to attend the trial.''</p>
        <p>President Mohammad Khatami, the leader of a broad reformist movement that hopes to depoliticize the conservative judiciary, had pledged that the trial would be conducted according to the rule of law and human rights.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Khatami controls neither  the judiciary nor the state broadcasting system, which answer to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is chosen by the senior Muslim clergy and is the paramount political and religious authority in the country.</p>
        <p>Both institutions are dominated by conservatives, who have recently mounted a full-scale assault on President Khatami's pro-reform supporters, closing 16 of their publications, jailing their leaders as un-Islamic and accusing them of being foreign agents.</p>
        <p>Several hard-line clerics and judges have already labeled the accused Shiraz Jews as being Zionist spies. Local court officials, pressed by reporters and diplomats to justify the charges against the 13 men, have also maintained that some of the defendants had confessed during interrogations to being spies for Israel.</p>
        <p>But defense lawyers said that any such admissions were not valid because none of the defendants were represented by counsel until a few weeks ago. They said the only evidence against them is the transcripts of those interrogations, which were conducted by the trial judge who acts as both prosecutor and judge under Iran's legal system.</p>
        <p>The defendants -- part-time Hebrew teachers, shop assistants, an 18-year-old high school student and a professor of English -- are accused of operating a spy network for Israel. If convicted, they could be executed.</p>
        <p>Their lawyers said several of the defendants had secretly visited relatives in Israel, but none had access to classified information or passed any state secrets, as required for a conviction on espionage charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tefileen spent about four hours with the Revolutionary Court judge today.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Hussein Ali Amiri, the head of the court system in Shiraz, the provincial capital, told reporters that Mr. Tefileen had admitted in court that he had ''connections with the Mossad,'' the Israeli secret service, and had passed ''confidential information'' to the agency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Amiri said that for reasons of national security, he could not describe the nature of the information that Mr. Tefileen is supposed to have turned over. Some Iranian Muslims, he added, provided secrets to the Jews, and some have been arrested.</p>
        <p>But he said he could not explain why those Muslims, who have never been identified by the authorities or seen in court, were released on bail months ago.</p>
        <p>None of the defendants work in a position that would provide access to  state secrets, their families have said. Mr. Tefileen's younger brother, Omid, described him as ''a regular guy.'' Both work in their father's shoe store, he said. Omid Tefileen is also charged in the case, but he is one of three defendants who is free on bail.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of cases where spies are ordinary people,'' responded Mr. Amiri, when asked how a shoe salesman could run an espionage network. ''In all the spy stories you read, the spies are just ordinary people.''</p>
        <p>The trial, which was set to begin three weeks ago but was postponed until today to give the defense more time to prepare, is taking place during a wider political conflict between reformers backing President Khatami and conservatives who are using the courts to undermine and persecute his liberal supporters.</p>
        <p>In addition, hostility toward Israel is one of the litmus tests of loyalty toward the Islamic system in Iran. With many in their own ranks facing charges of insulting Islam, neither the president nor his supporters have been willing to interfere in a high-profile case that involves alleged spying for the country's archenemy.</p>
        <p>Israel has denied any connection with the men, and their families have said the charges are false.</p>
