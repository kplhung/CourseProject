        <p>What should your doctor know about you even before you have donned that unglamorous gown and related the reason for your visit? On a recent first visit to an internist, I was handed a medical history form that struck me as unusually thorough in exploring factors that could affect my health or influence any symptoms I might have. The form reflected some of the most pressing medical-social issues of our day.</p>
        <p>In addition to the usual questions about my personal and family medical history, current symptoms or complaints about my health, allergies, operations, immunizations and personal habits like smoking and drinking, I was asked:</p>
        <p>*Do you wear seat belts?</p>
        <p>*Do you wear a bike helmet?</p>
        <p>*If there is a gun in your home, is it out of children's reach and unloaded?</p>
        <p>*Do you use drugs (marijuana, cocaine, crack, etc.)?</p>
        <p>*Have you ever engaged in any activity which has put you at risk of getting AIDS?</p>
        <p>*Do you wish to be tested for AIDS?</p>
        <p>*Have you worked with chemicals, paints, asbestos or other hazardous materials?</p>
        <p>*Are you in a relationship in which you have been physically hurt (e.g. slapped, kicked, punched, bruised) by your partner?</p>
        <p>*Do you ever feel afraid of your partner?</p>
        <p>*Do you have a ''living will''?</p>
        <p>*Do you have a donor card?</p>
        <p>Also, in questioning me about the medicines I take, the form asks about over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, herbs and other supplements. Many people treat themselves for all kinds of problems with over-the-counter supplements, often failing to realize that a substance with a druglike effect is a drug and can have side effects, including bad interactions with prescriptions. Also, those who take megadoses of nutrients may be distorting their metabolism and inducing deficiencies of important nutrients.</p>
        <p>Never had I been asked about such matters: the kinds of questions that should make patients think about how they may put themselves or their families at risk and what they can do to improve their chances of living healthfully, ending life peacefully and passing on their viable organs to others.</p>
        <p>As impressed as I was about these queries, I was surprised by the absence of others. I was asked about coffee, tea and alcohol consumption, but not about diet or weight-related issues. Nor were there any questions about exercise or stress reduction.</p>
        <p>So while I was delighted to see doctors taking note of items like seat belts and guns, I was dismayed by the seeming lack of concern about eating, exercise and stress reduction. Excess stress can undermine the immune system and render a person susceptible to conditions like frequent infections, cancer and heart disease.</p>
        <p>I realize that I am asking a lot from doctors. Not only must they know about symptoms, tests, medicines and a 2,700-page book of ailments, but also about matters rarely discussed in training. But evidence shows that the foods people eat, how much they exercise, whether they are chronically stressed and how well they cope with stress can affect their health and well-being, including their risk of developing heart disease, cancer, hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis and depression. Thus, it becomes increasingly important for doctors to bone up on these matters and start asking about them.</p>
        <p>And while doctors may not feel competent to offer nutrition or exercise advice or tips on stress reduction, they should be able to refer patients to dietitians, exercise physiologists or mental health professionals trained to handle such problems.</p>
        <p>The medical history questionnaire I completed did ask some other important questions: the dates of my last Pap smear, my last mammogram and breast exam, cholesterol check and stool check for blood. Of course, the question about a prostate exam was not relevant to me, but is certainly important to every white man over 50 and every black man over 40.</p>
        <p>Also important were the questions about family medical history, particularly health problems with hereditary components. The form also asked whether any members of my family -- parents, grandparents and siblings -- ever had the following disorders and at about what age: cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, strokes, mental disease, drug or alcohol addiction, glaucoma, bleeding disorders or any other significant problems.</p>
        <p>Although I had long thought I came from pretty hardy stock, completing this portion of the questionnaire got me thinking twice about my potential medical vulnerability. My father and grandfather had heart disease, first diagnosed in their 50's.</p>
        <p>My mother died from ovarian cancer at 49; her father died of prostate cancer at 60, and her mother died of esophageal cancer in her 70's. My paternal grandmother had adult-onset diabetes, diagnosed in her 50's, and had strokes in her 80's and 90's. My brother at age 54 has high blood pressure and moderately high cholesterol, which he is wisely getting treated so that he does not suffer the same fates.</p>
        <p>So, all in all, it was a good idea for me to get a checkup. Answering those questions reinforced my determination to live a health-promoting life, which includes a diet rich in vegetables and fruits and whole grains, the use of olive and canola oils in place of saturated fats like butter and hydrogenated vegetable oils (found mainly in processed foods) and moderate amounts of animal protein, including some lean red meat but also lots of fish.</p>
        <p>I do not need encouragement to exercise. I do a brisk three-mile walk and swim half a mile or more daily and play tennis three or four times a week. Depending on the season, I ice-skate, cross-country ski, hike and cycle, and I use my bike whenever possible.</p>
        <p>I even got a shorter haircut so my bike helmet would cause less havoc. Regular physical activity is my primary means of coping with the stresses of modern life. I do not meditate or do yoga, but these are two other effective stress reducers for those who need some extra calming down.</p>
