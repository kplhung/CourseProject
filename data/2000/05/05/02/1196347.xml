        <p>A day after a former congressman from Westchester County, Joseph J. DioGuardi, announced that he would seek the Conservative Party endorsement to run for the United States Senate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declared yesterday that he, too, wanted the party's endorsement. Mr. Giuliani's aides sought for the first time to set up a meeting between the mayor and state Conservative Party leaders.</p>
        <p>Michael Long, the state party's chairman, said that he was called early yesterday by an aide to Mr. Giuliani requesting a meeting. An aide to Mr. Giuliani confirmed the call, and said a meeting could happen over the next few days. Neither side would identify the intermediary.</p>
        <p>The prospect of a credible conservative candidate is a matter of clear concern to Mr. Giuliani's aides, since Mr. DioGuardi, running on the right, would presumably draw votes away from Mr. Giuliani in his Senate contest with Hillary Rodham Clinton.  And Mr. DioGuardi, the former two-term congressman, said in an interview that he wants to run as the candidate of the Conservative, Right-to-Life and Independence Parties.</p>
        <p>The relationship between Mr. Long and Mr. Giuliani has been strained, and evidence remained yesterday of  abundant hostility between the two.  Aides to both suggested that Mr. Giuliani's prospects of winning the Conservative endorsement remained fairly remote. Mr. Long noted that he had repeatedly said that he was open to a meeting with Mr. Giuliani over the last year, and that Mr. Giuliani had shunned his overtures -- until Mr. DioGuardi's plans became known.</p>
        <p>''Maybe they were planning to make the call anyhow,'' Mr. Long said sarcastically. ''It seems coincidental that all of a sudden a story appears, and the phone rings first thing in the morning, saying the mayor would like to meet with you.''</p>
        <p>Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island borough president and a close ally of Mr. Giuliani, attacked Mr. Long for entertaining the prospect of running Mr. DioGuardi against the mayor. ''Mike Long has been on a mission to destroy Rudy Giuliani,'' Mr. Molinari said. ''And now putting Joe DioGuardi out there clearly is designed as an opportunity to try to siphon off enough votes to make Rudy Giuliani a loser. It doesn't elect Rudy Giuliani. It elects Hillary. If Rudy loses, people are going to blame Mike Long and the Conservative Party.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday was filled with maneuvering by the smaller parties who are trying to wield some influence in this Senate race. Mrs. Clinton announced that she would appear before the policy committee of the Liberal Party this Saturday. Her aides, though, sought to play down expectations, noting Mr. Giuliani's close friendship with Raymond B. Harding, the party leader, and saying they thought it was unlikely she would win its support.</p>
        <p>And Lenora Fulani, a leader of the left-wing New Alliance Party who controls a faction of the Independence Party, called a news conference to assail Mrs. Clinton for attacking ''extremism'' in the Independence Party when she and Mr. Giuliani appeared before its members on Saturday. The first lady was referring to the party's affiliation with Ms. Fulani and Patrick J. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Clinton's slanderous personal attacks on me at the Independence Party forum on Saturday indicate that she and her professional advisers thought she could score some political points by name-calling,'' Ms. Fulani said. ''Obviously, they feel completely secure that they have the support of New York's black leadership and that they can single me out for abuse.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, defended the remarks. ''Pat Buchanan and his chief ally in New York, Lenora Fulani, have a long history of making anti-Semitic and divisive statements,'' he said. ''That's why Hillary made it very clear on Saturday that she won't compromise her principles by running on a ticket with Pat Buchanan.''</p>
        <p>At City Hall, Mr. Giuliani said that he had expressed his interest in winning the Conservative Party endorsement when Mr. Long called him on Thursday to offer best wishes, after the mayor announced he had prostate cancer. Mr. Giuliani said he had talked briefly with Mr. Long about his political support, adding that it would be better to work out any details in private.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani suggested that he might seek a primary to win the Conservative Party's support. ''I would be pretty confident that I would win a Conservative Party primary,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Long disputed Mr. Giuliani's account of their conversation, saying the mayor never asked for the endorsement. ''My door is open'' to discussion, Mr. Long said, but he reiterated that he would not support endorsing Mr. Giuliani unless he dropped his opposition to bans on some forms of late-term abortion, and abandoned his effort to run as a Liberal Party candidate, as well.</p>
        <p>''If he gets their endorsement, I would consider that he has slammed the door shut,'' Mr. Long said. ''The only thing left for him to do is to have people call me names and then try to bully his way into a primary somehow. I think that's pure arrogance if that's what they do.''</p>
