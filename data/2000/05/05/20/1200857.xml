        <p>A march along Harlem's main shopping street in honor of Malcolm X yesterday drew criticism from some business owners who said they were pressured into closing for much of the afternoon by organizers of the event.</p>
        <p>About three dozen people, waving flags and chanting, ''Whose street? Our street!'' and ''Black power!'' marched along 125th Street escorted  by about a dozen police officers. They stopped in front of stores that had declined to close for what would have been Malcolm X's 75th birthday, shouting, ''Disrespect!'' and ''Shut them down!''</p>
        <p>In a few cases, marchers entered shops to speak with store managers. As the group passed, gates began to roll down.</p>
        <p>While many businesses closed willingly, some shopkeepers fumed, saying they felt intimidated.</p>
        <p>''We don't close on Independence Day or even on Christmas, so I don't see why we should have to close today,'' said Robert Depay, a manager at Regine 125, a clothing store that has been on the street for seven years. ''There are people who want to shop. But they came in here and told us to close, so I have to close.''</p>
        <p>The march was organized by the Malcolm X 75th Anniversary Commemoration Coalition, made up of five groups including the December 12th Movement and the New Afrika Liberation Front. Similar events have taken place in Harlem for the last 10 years on Malcolm X's birthday. In previous years, the group has asked stores to close for an hour or two for the birthday, but because yesterday was the 75th, it sought a longer hiatus, from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>Roger Wareham, a spokesman for the coalition, said there was no intimidation of shop owners. ''We asked them to close and it was up to them,'' he said. He added that the group had sent letters to business owners in the neighborhood three months ago, asking them to close.</p>
        <p>''In this period when black people are losing control of Harlem,'' he said, ''it's very important that we demand that our heroes be respected by those people who are doing business in our community. There's a lot of issues we need to gain control of and this is a demonstration of the kind of control we still have.''</p>
        <p>The event has long outraged some neighborhood leaders, who say the group forces store owners to close. This year, the 125th Street Business Improvement District told neighborhood businesses that the district did not support the shutdown.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, about 35 business owners met with the district's leaders and police officers from the 28th Precinct, asking the police for greater protection for businesses that  stayed open.</p>
        <p>Barbara Askins, president of the business improvement district, said some store owners complained yesterday that the police protection was insufficient and locked their doors to avoid harassment.</p>
        <p>Local officials also said they were dismayed. ''The intimidation and the harassment is something that we really don't like,'' said Stanley Gleaton, chairman of Community Board 10, who watched the march from 125th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, a corner where Malcolm X spoke many times during his life. ''Their permit was to march and assemble, not to harass people, and that's what they've been doing.''</p>
        <p>At the Metropolitan Life Insurance Financial Services Center on 125th Street, the gate was half-closed but  workers still conducted business.</p>
        <p>''We've only been opened eight months, and not being familiar with the people in the demonstration we decided to be safe rather than sorry,'' said Al Florant, director of marketing and sales for Met Life.</p>
