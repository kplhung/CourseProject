        <p>At the invitation of the violinist and conductor Jaime Laredo, who runs the popular chamber music series at the 92nd Street Y on Lexington Avenue, guest artists frequently join the core players for concerts. But there are guests and there are guests. And on Tuesday night one of the most respected elders of chamber music, the cellist Janos Starker, 75, participated in a program. Every time this important Budapest-born musician plays there is a sense of event in the hall. No doubt the choice of Schubert's late Quintet in C, one of the great works of the repertory, was made in deference to Mr. Starker, whose performances of the core Viennese masters have long been admired.</p>
        <p>In his prime Mr. Starker's playing was hailed for its rich tone put to rigorous musical purpose. He was more restrained expressively than other leading cellists of his day. But there was always a lucid musical and structural clarity in his playing that created its own sense of excitement. These qualities of old still came through whenever one of Mr. Starker's arching cello lines lifted through the string textures of the Schubert work. And the entire ensemble -- the violinist Ida Kavafian, the violist Michael Tree, Sharon Robinson playing the other cello part and Mr. Laredo playing first violin -- brought a sense of restraint, clarity and character to the performance that seemed in sympathy with Mr. Starker's approach to music-making.</p>

        <p>At the invitation of the violinist and conductor Jaime Laredo, who runs the popular chamber music series at the 92nd Street Y on Lexington Avenue, guest artists frequently join the core players for concerts. But there are guests and there are guests. And on Tuesday night one of the most respected elders of chamber music, the cellist Janos Starker, 75, participated in a program. Every time this important Budapest-born musician plays there is a sense of event in the hall. No doubt the choice of Schubert's late Quintet in C, one of the great works of the repertory, was made in deference to Mr. Starker, whose performances of the core Viennese masters have long been admired.</p>
        <p>In his prime Mr. Starker's playing was hailed for its rich tone put to rigorous musical purpose. He was more restrained expressively than other leading cellists of his day. But there was always a lucid musical and structural clarity in his playing that created its own sense of excitement. These qualities of old still came through whenever one of Mr. Starker's arching cello lines lifted through the string textures of the Schubert work. And the entire ensemble -- the violinist Ida Kavafian, the violist Michael Tree, Sharon Robinson playing the other cello part and Mr. Laredo playing first violin -- brought a sense of restraint, clarity and character to the performance that seemed in sympathy with Mr. Starker's approach to music-making.</p>
        <p>The concert began with a performance of the Overture to Strauss's opera ''Capriccio,'' which is, in fact, a one-movement string sextet. This work was intended to be heard from an orchestra pit, so the textures are continually thick, to give the work body. The musicians, joined by the violist Cynthia Phelps, were not appreciably successful in bringing transparency to the music as a chamber work, but they played with lyrical grace and the right touch of melancholy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starker did not play in the performance of Mozart's Quintet in G minor, a great work, though had the musicians offered something fresher, preferably contemporary, in its place, the program would have better prepared us for the substantive Schubert quintet. Only Mr. Laredo's sometimes faulty intonation in virtuosic passages marred the performances now and then. He is a busy musician: a conductor, teacher, violin and viola soloist and chamber music player. Perhaps he's too busy.</p>
