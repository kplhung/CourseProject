        <p>If they are honest, most of the fans at Madison Square Garden last night would admit that they did not think he had it in him. Sure, he can spin and hit his turnaround jump shot. He can grab a rebound here and there, block a shot every once in awhile and convert layups. But fly in like a  20-something player and slam dunk a rebound over one of the game's most dominant centers?</p>
        <p>Not Patrick Ewing. Not at age 37.</p>

        <p>If they are honest, most of the fans at Madison Square Garden last night would admit that they did not think he had it in him. Sure, he can spin and hit his turnaround jump shot. He can grab a rebound here and there, block a shot every once in awhile and convert layups. But fly in like a  20-something player and slam dunk a rebound over one of the game's most dominant centers?</p>
        <p>Not Patrick Ewing. Not at age 37.</p>
        <p>But there was Ewing, his bones creaking and his gait telling tales of his 15 years of National Basketball Association wars, swooping toward the hoop with 1 minute 57 seconds to play.</p>
        <p>A huge comeback had the Knicks within 4 points of the Miami Heat, but the picture was still somewhat bleak. The Heat, its rookie point guard Anthony Carter canning jumpers, had been answering Knicks baskets throughout the fourth quarter, so the home team needed something special to put itself and its crowd over the top.</p>
        <p>Here came Ewing. Chris Childs, who had argued with Ewing two days before during Game 5, missed an  18-footer, and Ewing soared in from the right side like Marcus Camby to catch the rebound with two hands and dunk it, all in one motion. The play sent the Garden fans, many of whom had been booing the Knicks an hour earlier, into hysterics and killed the Heat's momentum.</p>
        <p>Moments later, Childs sank two free throws to tie the score. Then Allan Houston scored the game-winning points from the foul line with 17.6 seconds to play, giving the Knicks an almost unfathomable  72-70 victory in a game in which they trailed by 18 points in the second quarter and 15 points at the half.</p>
        <p>''Young legs,'' Childs said of Ewing when asked about the dunk. ''Young legs from a true warrior. He wanted it, and the team that wants it the most is going to win.''</p>
        <p>Ewing, his chances to win an elusive championship fading fast, clearly wanted it badly. That is the only way to explain his outplaying Alonzo Mourning, his younger, stronger protege for the Heat, who finished with 22 points, 10 rebounds and 3 blocks. In addition to dunking over the off-balance Mourning in the final two minutes, Ewing registered 15 points and a game-high 18 rebounds. His tenacious board work allowed the Knicks to outrebound the Heat for the first time this series, 46-41.</p>
        <p>Coach Jeff Van Gundy had harped on the Knicks' horrible rebounding before the game, singling it out as the primary reason for their 3-2 deficit in the series. While everyone hit the boards a little harder -- Latrell Sprewell, for example, grabbed nine rebounds -- no one heeded Van Gundy as well as Ewing.</p>
        <p>Ewing started hot by recording 5 points and 7 rebounds in the first quarter. When the Knicks fell behind by 45-30 at the break, only Ewing had played well. Though he was shooting only 4 for 11 from the floor, he had 11 points.</p>
        <p>''Patrick was terrific tonight,'' Van Gundy said. ''He really fought hard on the rebound. He was going against a great, great player in Mourning. I'm always happy for him when he is successful.''</p>
        <p>Mourning said Ewing's late dunk buried the Heat. ''That was huge,'' Mourning said. ''It was really big. All I had to do was turn and back him out. If I had done that, it would probably be a different story now.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he was surprised by Ewing's spring, Mourning laughed heartily. ''Y'all continue to be surprised by that man,'' he said. ''Then y'all are going to be talking about trading him at the end of the year.''</p>
        <p>Ewing, the veteran of so many playoff battles, was humble and unenthusiastic afterward, realizing that the Knicks' job was not finished. He was not excited when recalling his dunk, just businesslike.</p>
        <p>''Chris shot the ball,'' Ewing said. ''Alonzo went to help, gave me a little lane to get to the rim and I just went up and I was able to get my left hand on it and dunk it back in.''</p>
        <p>Ewing appeared as cool while the Knicks were down big as he was after the game. When asked how a team manages to fight back from such a large deficit, he said, ''Don't let a lot of the negative thoughts creep into your mind, stay focused, still believe in yourself and go out and play.''</p>
        <p>Obviously, Ewing believes in himself. And now, after he turned back the clock and went airborne, maybe some of his detractors will, too.</p>
