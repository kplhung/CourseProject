        <p>A Nassau County judge was arraigned this morning, while lying in bed in a psychiatric ward, on charges that he stabbed his wife twice in the back with a kitchen knife during an argument in their home.</p>
        <p>The arrest of the judge, Paul Kowtna, on Thursday shook many in the legal profession here, where the judge is known for his no-nonsense, no-quarter approach to dispensing justice.</p>
        <p>Judge Kowtna, 51, called 911 on Thursday morning, and police officers who arrived at his home in New Hyde Park found him muttering incoherently as his wife, Mary, wandered around in a blood-soaked house coat.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kowtna, 45, suffered a punctured lung in the attack and was listed in stable condition this afternoon at the North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, a hospital spokesman said.</p>
        <p>The judge was taken to the Nassau County Medical Center emergency room and later transferred to the psychiatric ward, where he is being held for observation, said his lawyer, Thomas Hession.</p>
        <p>At his arraignment this morning, the judge offered no explanation for the stabbing and had little to say, Mr. Hession said. Judge Kowtna was charged with two counts of first-degree assault and two counts of second-degree assault, according to a spokesman for the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, whose office is prosecuting the case. If convicted, Judge Kowtna could face a minimum of five years in prison. He is being held at the hospital without bond.</p>
        <p>The judge was described today by many in the county's legal circle as a drill sergeant who ran his courtroom like a boot camp. He regularly berated lawyers for being ill prepared,  imposed high sentences in pretrial deals and, many lawyers said, excluded evidence and witnesses to end trials quickly.</p>
        <p>''He's a stern man, a tough man,'' said Daniel A. Conti, a defense lawyer from Hempstead. ''He expected you to be prepared and if you weren't, he came down on you. He was fanatical about moving his cases, and he is not one for adjournments or light plea bargains.''</p>
        <p>Those who worked alongside Judge Kowtna at the Nassau County Courthouse praised his diligence.</p>
        <p>''He was fair and firm on all cases of domestic violence, rape, murder and burglary,'' said Ira H. Wexner, supervising judge of Nassau County Courts. ''He was consistent and near the top of all judges. He is a big loss to the court.''</p>
        <p>A former county prosecutor and a Republican, Judge Kowtna was elected to the bench seven years ago. Since then, he has been one of the most productive judges on Long Island, averaging more trial days over the last three years than any other -- presiding over 24 trials last year and working 216 days. He has also accepted the fewest plea agreements, according to court records.</p>
        <p>Those close to the judge said they doubted that the heavy workload had contributed to the attack. Instead, they suggested that family stress may have played a role. The judge has two daughters, the older a college student, said a friend of the judge, adding that the judge was ''really broken up'' about the younger daughter.</p>
        <p>''She's learning disabled and I guess she was having a pretty hard time lately,'' the friend said. ''That girl is everything to him, and he couldn't handle it.''</p>
        <p>The judge's lawyer, Mr. Hession, said Judge Kowtna was devoted to his family, placing it above all else. He said he could not say why the judge would attack his wife.</p>
        <p>The Kowtnas began arguing shortly after 8 a.m. Thursday, after the younger daughter had left for school, the police said. When the authorities arrived at the Kowtnas' home, the judge was acting irrationally but did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, said Sgt. Kevin Smith, a detective and spokesman for the Nassau County Police Department.</p>
        <p>Neighbors in the Kowtnas' quiet  block of stone cottages did not seem surprised by the events. Some said they knew little about the couple except that they heard them arguing regularly.</p>
        <p>''He's a strange bird -- that I can tell you,'' said Heinz Kling, a retiree who has lived across the street from the Kowtnas for 15 years. ''I find it really strange that he wouldn't say hello to a neighbor.''</p>
