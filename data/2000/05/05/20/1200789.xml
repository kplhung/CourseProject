        <p>A revival of ''Small Craft Warnings'' opened last summer for a brief run at the TriBeCa Playhouse. It reopened there on May 9. Following are excerpts from Peter Marks's review, which appeared in The New York Times on July 1, 1999.</p>
        <p>You get a shot of reality with your drink order at Monk's Place, the ramshackle gin mill that is the setting for ''Small Craft Warnings,'' Tennessee Williams's 1972 rap session of a drama. The bar stools are filled each night by a motley assortment of grifters, drifters and rowdies, fellow travelers in the shabby margins of life, consigned to the fringes by dint of criminal misdeed, decadent impulse or illness of the head.</p>
        <p>The speeches evoke lives steered into dark corners. Yet there is dignity in the testimony of these trapped sinners, as frozen in place as the petrified sailfish over Monk's bar. The mere act of articulating their sins and regrets endows them with a kind of poetic valor.</p>
        <p>Nothing else really happens in ''Small Craft Warnings,'' which is receiving a respectable revival by the director Jeff Cohen and his Worth Street Theater Company in TriBeCa. The play was regarded as minor Williams when it made its debut 27 years ago -- Walter Kerr found it a work of ''obvious immobility'' -- and its most remarkable feature, at the time, was the performance by Williams himself in the production as an occasional understudy.</p>
        <p>That Williams would have made such uncharacteristic appearances at that late stage of his career is a striking footnote; he had taken to complaining that critics and other analysts had, in recent years, tended to review his life rather than his plays. What Mr. Cohen's revival demonstrates is that the play had strengths quite apart from the curiosity value of Williams's participation in it. The anguish in Monk's Place is real.</p>
        <p>Taking place entirely in the seedy bar on the Southern California coast, ''Small Craft Warnings'' fills the establishment with a recognizable array of Williams characters, from Leona, the lusty, needy libertine played by Cristine McMurdo-Wallis, to Quentin, the dapper homosexual screenwriter who arrives with a young man on his arm and a harrowing vacancy in his soul.</p>
        <p>Even in this outpost of outsiders, Quentin is treated as unwelcome; only Leona, who has not recovered from the death of her frail, beautiful brother, pulls up a chair. And as portrayed with both restraint and electricity by David Greenspan, he is the embodiment of some terminal sense of disappointment in the playwright's psyche.</p>
