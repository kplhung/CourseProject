        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Proponents of the antimissile project (''A Shield of Their Own,''  letter, May 13) are wrong to consider an antimissile shield a defensive measure. Every schoolchild knows that when your opponent in a snowball fight starts collecting garbage can lids, the obvious response is to pile up more snowballs and figure out a sneakier way to deliver them.</p>
        <p>Similarly, adversaries in a nuclear age are apt to increase their own arsenals in response to the other side's development of a missile defense, or in a worst-case scenario, smuggle a bomb in on a ship or even in a suitcase.</p>

        <p>In any case, do we want to spend another $60 billion that could much better be used in other ways, on a device that has never been shown to work? And why would North Korea or any other so-called rogue state be willing to invite certain annihilation by firing one or two missiles at the United States?</p>
