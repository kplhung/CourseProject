        <p>The death of distinct Protestant denominations has been, it appears, greatly exaggerated. For some while, the very notion of denomination -- Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Lutherans and so on -- has been viewed as theologically fuzzy and sociologically doomed.</p>
        <p>A denomination, with its own distinctive doctrinal emphases, modes of worship and forms of organization, does not claim to be the only legitimate expression of Christianity, although it may claim to be the best. Especially in the United States, the denominational society par excellence, Christian denominations have lived side by side, without aspiring to encompass all believers in a territory, as Roman Catholic, Orthodox or many established national churches have historically done. And unlike small, intense sectarian movements, denominations do not consider friendly cooperation with one another a betrayal of doctrinal purity.</p>
        <p>Sounds cozy, and maybe too cozy.  The boundaries separating denominations have long grown blurry for many Protestants, who say that being Methodist or Presbyterian or Baptist does not really matter to them or, indeed, that they are not sure what it means.</p>
        <p>This decline of denominationalism is not really surprising. Denominations were based, after all, on distinctions of social class, region, ethnicity and race, along with (perhaps more than) distinctions of doctrine, practice and polity. There were unmistakable denominational cultures.  Think of Garrison Keillor's endless reminders of the Lake Wobegon Lutheran proclivity for the tuna-and-noodle hot dish. Or of the stock portrayals of East Coast Episcopalians, Midwest Methodists and Southern Baptists in any number of short stories and novels.</p>
        <p>Mobility, education, intermarriage and the common, media-borne culture of entertainment and advertising have all taken their toll on these differences. From one point of view, this is a very good thing. Denominations were often crucial rungs on the ladder of class and status. Going from the Baptist Church to the Presbyterian or Episcopal Church was a sign of upward mobility.</p>
        <p>Indeed, in 1929, a young theologian, H. Richard Niebuhr, made his reputation by dissecting ''The Social Sources of Denominationalism,'' a landmark study in American religion. For Niebuhr, denominational divisions represented nothing less than a ''moral failure of Christianity.''</p>
        <p>So should the disappearance of denominations be counted a moral success? While no one regrets the fading of denominational snobbishness, the eclipse of differences that were deeply rooted in history and theology has often appeared to be less a triumph of Christian unity than a general ''dumbing down'' of belief and practice.</p>
        <p>That is why a report by Prof. Nancy T. Ammerman, a distinguished sociologist of religion who teaches at Hartford Seminary in Connecticut, will be considered good news. The glass of denominationalism is at least half full, she wrote two months ago in the liberal Protestant weekly The Christian Century.</p>
        <p>A study of a wide range of Protestant congregations, she reported, found that 55 percent of them, ''slightly more among conservatives, slightly less among liberals,'' considered themselves ''strong standard-bearers of their denominational tradition.''</p>
        <p>This is a striking finding. Denominational identity is generally related, as one might expect, to the proportion of a congregation's members who grew up in its tradition, compared with the proportion who, in the language of sociology of religion, are ''switchers.'' Yet, ''nearly three-quarters of the white Protestant congregations we studied,'' Professor Ammerman wrote, ''reported that half or more of their members grew up in another denomination.''</p>
        <p>But not even high percentages of switchers have discouraged congregations that really want to maintain their denominational identity, Professor Ammerman said. They seemed to be going about it very consciously, deliberately emphasizing denominational doctrines in their preaching and religious education, especially for new members.</p>
        <p>A Lutheran pastor near Seattle spoke of an ''unabashedly Lutheran'' stress on God's grace in his congregation's preaching and teaching. A Presbyterian pastor did play down ''John Calvin's doctrine of special providence and -- horror of horrors -- his doctrine of predestination.'' To stop exploring predestination and other specifically Calvinist teachings, he said, would amount to no longer ''understanding what it means to be Presbyterian.''</p>
        <p>In some cases, it was not so much specific doctrines as specific traditions of worship that were the vehicles for carrying denominational identity. This was particularly true of Episcopalians and their attachment to the ritual found in the Book of Common Prayer. It was also true of the evangelical congregations associated with the recent Vineyard movement, whose pastors display a nearly de rigueur informality in attire and whose worship is permeated with its distinctive ''praise music.''</p>
        <p>Individual congregations feel free to reconfigure their denominational identities in ways that might not have been accepted formerly, Professor Ammerman and her fellow researchers found, but ''for about half the Protestant congregations, an intentional retrieval and construction of tradition'' was alive and well, with denominational identity ''no longer taken for granted, but now chosen; no longer a matter of enclave and birth, but now a matter of faith and practice.''</p>
        <p>''Those congregations in which distinct denominational identities are being chosen and nurtured do not seem to be the worse for it,'' Professor Ammerman wrote. ''Most are vital and growing, and few, if any, are isolated or hostile to the outside world.''</p>
        <p>''Unlike the denominationalism Niebuhr feared, they are building distinctions based more on ritual and doctrine than on social divisions,'' she concluded. ''Theirs is an experiment in blending tradition and openness that bears watching.''</p>
