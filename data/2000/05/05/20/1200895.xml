        <p>The return of Reggie Miller marked the end of the Philadelphia 76ers' season. Led by Miller, who returned from a one-game suspension to score 25 points, the Indiana Pacers advanced to the Eastern Conference finals by eliminating the Sixers, 106-90, tonight in Game 6 of their playoff series. By winning the four-of-seven-game series, 4-2, Indiana will make its third consecutive trip to the conference finals, against the winner of the Knicks-Miami Heat series.</p>
        <p>Showing their experience and poise in front of a noisy, partisan Sixers' crowd at the First Union Center, the Pacers never trailed after the first few minutes and held off every Philadelphia rally. And Miller, who served a one-game suspension for throwing a punch at Matt Geiger in Game 4, got revenge tonight by leading the Pacers on 10-for-19 shooting from the field, lifting his team to the next round and sending the Sixers on vacation.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes if you want to do something right, you have to do it yourself,'' said Miller, one of basketball's best big-game performers. ''It was tough watching Game 5, and I was upset at myself for putting myself in that situation. I had a whole week to stew about it. I wanted to do something about it tonight.''</p>
        <p>With Miller making jumpers, complemented by Jalen Rose, who added 21 points, the Pacers had a one-two combination that Philadelphia never contained. The Sixers had hoped to become the first team in National Basketball Association history to rally from a 3-0 deficit to win a series, but as tonight's game progressed, Philadelphia finally succumbed.</p>
        <p>The Pacers did a superb defensive job on Allen Iverson, Philadelphia's All-Star guard, who was held to 18 points on 7-for-20 shooting. When Iverson does not have a huge offensive game, the Sixers are in trouble. As the final seconds ticked away, Iverson sat wearily on the bench with tears in his eyes, watching his team eliminated by Indiana for the second consecutive year.</p>
        <p>''I loved the heart we showed, but I had seen that all season'' Iverson said. ''I have to get better, and we have to get better as a team. I'm a competitor, and as the clock went down, I saw my whole season pass by, just like that. It hurt.''</p>
        <p>After leading by 3 points at halftime, Indiana took control by dominating the third quarter, outscoring Philadelphia by 29-16. All of Indiana's main offensive weapons clicked. Miller was making jumpers. Rose was finding open space on the other side of the floor. Mark Jackson, Indiana's point guard, who had 11 assists, used his size to post up Iverson. And Rik Smits, who had 18 points and 9 rebounds, had his most assertive game of the series.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Indiana ran two or three defenders at Iverson, forcing him to give up the ball or to take difficult shots. With Iverson in check and none of his teammates able to step up, the Sixers simply did not have enough offense to keep up. Five Sixers reached double figures, led by Aaron McKie with 19 points. But the Sixers shot just 39.1 percent over all, including 2 for 14 from 3-point range.</p>
        <p>After the Pacers took an 85-69 lead into the fourth quarter, the Sixers never got within 10 points. In the first half, the Sixers recovered from a 14-point deficit to tie the game, but when Indiana built its lead in the second half, the Sixers were a tired team that knew the end was near.</p>
        <p>''They did just about anything they wanted offensively,'' said Coach Larry Brown of Philadelphia. ''They were just better. We have to get better to be with the elite teams.''</p>
        <p>Making his first four shots and scoring 13 points in the first quarter, Miller made an early statement that he was back, just as sharp as ever. After most of his shots that connected, Miller turned toward the Sixers' fans in the front row and stared as he trotted down the court. This was Miller at his best, making huge shots and relishing his role as a villain. By the end of the game, Miller was smiling on the Indiana bench, looking forward to the next series.</p>
        <p>''Personally, I'd rather play the Knicks, because we could exorcise some demons there,'' Miller said. ''But we could also start a great new rivalry with the Heat.''</p>
        <p>After the game, Indiana took a businesslike approach to the victory, knowing there was more work ahead. The Pacers have never advanced to the N.B.A. finals, and they have a veteran group that may be running out of opportunities.</p>
        <p>''We're not satisfied,'' Jackson said. ''Our mission is to win this whole thing and we haven't done that.''</p>
