        <p>The young German baritone Matthias Goerne assembled a moving if unusually melancholy program for his recital at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday afternoon, the first of two concerts that are part of Lincoln Center's Great Performers series.

His theme was exile, and at the heart of the program were selections from Hanns Eisler's ''Hollywood Liederbuch,'' with a selection of dark-hued Schubert songs woven around them.</p>
        <p>Most of the Eisler songs had texts by Brecht, and the exile Brecht and Eisler write about is both specific and historically close at hand: their songs touch on their exile from Germany during World War II, with the recurring image of a radio bringing news (mostly bad) from their former homeland.

        <p>The young German baritone Matthias Goerne assembled a moving if unusually melancholy program for his recital at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday afternoon, the first of two concerts that are part of Lincoln Center's Great Performers series. (The second is tomorrow.) His theme was exile, and at the heart of the program were selections from Hanns Eisler's ''Hollywood Liederbuch,'' with a selection of dark-hued Schubert songs woven around them.</p>
        <p>Most of the Eisler songs had texts by Brecht, and the exile Brecht and Eisler write about is both specific and historically close at hand: their songs touch on their exile from Germany during World War II, with the recurring image of a radio bringing news (mostly bad) from their former homeland. One of them, though, ''Erinnerung an Eichendorff und Schumann,'' is a pointed setting of an Eichendorff verse that Schumann had set in his ''Liederkreis.''</p>
        <p>The Schumann reference may have provided the impulse for the other side of Mr. Goerne's program. The Eichendorff verse, with its imagery of a red-streaked sky and a homeland where the poet has been forgotten, is innocently nostalgic in Schumann's setting and far more pointed in Eisler's more sharp-edged reworking. But Mr. Goerne recognized that the contrast between the 19th- and 20th-century notions of isolation, displacement and nostalgia is interesting in itself, and could be shown just as powerfully if some 19th-century works, untampered with by later hands, punctuated the Eisler groups.</p>
        <p>Among Schubert's works he found songs of just the right tone, among them two settings of ''Der Wanderer'' (D. 489 and D. 649) and the three moody ''Gesange des Harfners.'' Yet he closed the concert with a hopeful glimmer: when Eisler's ''Kalifornischer Herbst,'' an evocation of autumn in California, mixed with images of Germany in a more peaceful time, gave way without pause to the closing work, Schubert's ''Fruhlingsglaube,'' it was as if the dark clouds were dispelled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goerne's flexible, warm baritone and his ear for interpretive detail are well suited to music of this kind. When he is at his best, he lets the music make its point through understated characterization. He did nothing, for example, to call attention to the bitter humor of Eisler and Brecht's ''Maske des Bosen,'' but the point came across, as did the subdued anger and outright desolation of some of the other songs. The Schubert readings were a bit less straight-faced: in ''Wehmut,'' Mr. Goerne showed an ability to create a stunning effect with a floating pianissimo phrase, and he made the sadness of the D. 649 setting of ''Der Wanderer'' palpable.</p>
        <p>But even in these, his manipulations were subtle, as was his supportive pianist, Eric Schneider.</p>
