        <p>Chen Shui-bian was sworn in as president of Taiwan this morning, a landmark for Taiwan's democracy but the start of a risky period in relations between this prospering island of 23 million people and a strengthening Chinese mainland that claims Taiwan as its own.</p>
        <p>With his inauguration, Mr. Chen ended 50 years of rule -- much of it under martial law -- by the Nationalist Party that fled from the mainland under Chiang Kai-shek in 1949.</p>
        <p>As the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, which has long advocated Taiwan's independence from China, Mr. Chen won a three-way race in March, in the island's second election of a national leader.</p>
        <p>He succeeds Lee Teng-hui, 77, the flamboyant Nationalist who became world famous for ushering democracy to Taiwan but whose recent tenure was increasingly tainted by his party's vote-buying and corruption.</p>
        <p>''This is the first peaceful transition of power from one political party to another in Taiwanese history and probably in all of Chinese history,'' said Wu Yu-shan, a political scientist at National Taiwan University. ''But this triumph is being overshadowed by the prospect of deep tension across the Taiwan Straits.''</p>
        <p>Today, in his first speech as president, Mr. Chen repeated pledges not to declare independence unless Taiwan comes under attack, but he did not give Beijing the commitment to ''one China'' it demands, and serious new tensions seemed likely.</p>
        <p>''Long live freedom and democracy,'' he shouted as he concluded.</p>
        <p>The inauguration took place in a brief ceremony inside the presidential palace a few minutes after 9 a.m. Mr. Chen bowed before a picture of Sun Yat-sen -- who is claimed by both the Taiwanese and the mainland governments as founding father -- then pledged to uphold the Constitution and was handed the national seal.</p>
        <p>The ceremony capped the storybook rise of Mr. Chen, 49, whose intelligence and preternatural determination took him from mud-house poverty to success as a corporate attorney before he became involved, in 1979, in the dissident movement against the Nationalists' authoritarian rule. He became a star of the opposition after his election as mayor of Taipei in 1994.</p>
        <p>Annette Lu, 55, was sworn in as vice president. She is an outspoken feminist and advocate of Taiwan independence with a law degree from Harvard who spent more than five years in Nationalist prisons in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>Until recently, Mr. Chen called for Taiwan's formal independence from the mainland -- a step that Beijing has repeatedly said would bring a military attack. Seeking to broaden his appeal among the worried electorate and to placate the United States, which is pledged to help defend Taiwan but does not want to be drawn into war, Mr. Chen has moderated his position.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen now says that since Taiwan already functions like a state it does not need to declare independence. He has held out olive branches to Beijing, proposing to talk about strengthened commerce and even about the meaning of ''one China.''</p>
        <p>Beijing officials have expressed growing impatience with Mr. Chen's refusal to accept their absolute precondition for any talks -- that Taiwan is part of a single China.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, the Communist Party's flagship paper, People's Daily, said that Mr. Chen has ''adopted an evasive and defiant posture'' over the one-China principle and that his friendly gestures ''lack sincerity.'' It reminded him that ''matters of sovereignty are not for negotiation.''</p>
        <p>In recent months, China has warned that indefinite delay in progress toward unity may be grounds for military action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen's long-anticipated inaugural speech today was almost an anticlimax, devoted mainly to calls for domestic reconciliation, cleaner politics and economic issues.</p>
        <p>In the most scrutinized portion, on cross-straits ties, Mr. Chen offered good will and pledged not to take formal steps toward independence.  As long as the mainland does not use military force against Taiwan, he said, ''I pledge that during my term in office, I will not declare independence.''</p>
        <p>He made one cryptic reference to ''jointly'' dealing ''with the question of a future 'one China,' '' which fell far short of the kind of commitment Beijing has sought.</p>
        <p>The international turnout for today's ceremony provided a stark reminder of China's relative power and its campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. Listed as attending were only four heads of state -- from Swaziland, Nicaragua, Palau and Nauru -- countries drawn from fewer than 30 states that have dared to recognize Taiwan in return for its financial aid.</p>
        <p>Representing President Clinton was Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former White House adviser. Although the United States sells defensive weapons to Taiwan and has strong economic ties, senior American officials do not visit since the United States, by agreement with Beijing, does not grant formal recognition.</p>
        <p>Taiwan's political status and relations with Beijing are always central issues here. But Mr. Chen's strongest mandate from the election, analysts say, was in domestic affairs, especially to start cleaning up corruption in politics, including growing ties between local Nationalist politicians and organized crime.</p>
        <p>As he takes on these and other issues, Mr. Chen will be operating in what for Taiwan is the novel territory of a divided government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen received less than a majority of votes in the election and faces a legislature dominated by the Nationalists. Experts give him good marks for cobbling together a multiparty cabinet that may blunt some opposition. But many still wonder whether he can govern with any force in a jumbled system of presidential and parliamentary institutions that in the past was always controlled by one disciplined party.</p>
        <p>In what many people here regarded as a master stroke, Mr. Chen persuaded the former Nationalist defense minister and a retired general, Tang Fei, to serve as prime minister. Mr. Tang is one of several holdovers in the national security field, a deliberate effort to assure various parties -- China, the United States and the Taiwanese -- that Mr. Chen will not act rashly to incite China.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tang's powers relative to the president's are not clearly defined, and he has lately been suffering complications from surgery.</p>
        <p>The cabinet includes a mix of Nationalists, members of Mr. Chen's party and others. But divisive questions have already been raised within the Nationalist and the Democratic Progressive parties about the party loyalty of those in the cabinet, and the extent to which they should follow Mr. Chen's lead on issues.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Lee, the outgoing president, was forced from his job as Nationalist Party leader, the Nationalists have been in chaos.</p>
        <p>A new third party, led by James Soong, a former Nationalist, is struggling to lure supporters from the legislative ranks and define its role. And the Democratic Progressives have begun squabbling as well.</p>
        <p>''Any new government is going to be somewhat messy and incoherent,'' said Shelley Rigger, an expert on Taiwan at Davidson College in North Carolina who gives Mr. Chen high marks under difficult circumstances. ''Chen is trying to put together a government that can actually govern, and he had to violate the conventional rules of party politics.''</p>
