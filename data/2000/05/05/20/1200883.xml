        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton faced a delicate political balancing act yesterday in reacting to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal from the Senate race: she sought to offer compassion to the mayor, while at the same time seeking to portray a business-as-usual agenda of campaigning.</p>
        <p>At her hastily organized press conference, at the auditorium of Local 1199 on West 43rd Street in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton talked about her wishes for the mayor's ''full and speedy recovery.'' At the same time she deflected every question about how the mayor's decision -- and the Republican Party's pending choice of a replacement -- would affect her campaign.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mrs. Clinton's aides acknowledge that the campaign had long ago begun studying the voting records and political backgrounds of each of the men who were considering replacing Mr. Giuliani on the Republican ticket. In the case of United States Representative Rick A. Lazio, who said yesterday that he would seek the nomination, Mrs. Clinton's campaign had already begun to compile information on the congressman's voting record, with an eye toward portraying him as a conservative ideologue who is less than supportive of abortion rights.</p>
        <p>But for Mrs. Clinton herself, yesterday included business-as-usual campaigning. She began her day in Brooklyn, where she attended a morning worship service at the Bridge Street African Methodist Episcopal Church, a prominent congregation in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  There, she was endorsed by the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, a former Democratic Unites States representative who is pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens. Mr. Flake supported Mr. Giuliani in his last mayoral bid but has recently been critical of the mayor.</p>
        <p>''New York needs a star in the Congress,'' Mr. Flake said. ''I believe that Hillary Clinton represents for us the best hope of being able to get the most for New York City.''</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Clinton stood next to Mr. Flake and other members of the clergy in the church, the tremors in the political landscape were already evident. When Mrs. Clinton was asked her reaction to the early reports that Mr. Giuliani had decided to withdraw from the Senate race, she declined to even discuss the possibility. ''I will wait until we know for sure,'' she said. ''We've had many reports over the last weeks. Let's all wait until we know for sure what the decision is.''</p>
        <p>But soon it became clear that the mayor's news conference -- and his withdrawal from the race -- was imminent. After giving a speech to 500 people at the A.M.E. church, Mrs. Clinton huddled with campaign aides, deciding to postpone any comment to reporters outside the church until Mr. Giuliani's news conference was over. Then she held a news conference to discuss his decision.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's aides said that the shift in the Republican Party's landscape would not affect the first lady's campaign in coming days. Although the last-minute conference that Mrs. Clinton held after calling the mayor caused her to miss one fund-raising event in Washington yesterday, she managed to make it to a second one there. And she will continue with her plans to campaign today in Mount Kisco.</p>
        <p>It was a point made yesterday by Senator Charles E. Schumer, the Democrat elected in 1998. Mr. Schumer advised Mrs. Clinton to emphasize her own political message rather than being concerned with her opponent.</p>
        <p>''My advice to Mrs. Clinton has been, 'Don't look over your shoulder,' '' Mr. Schumer said. '' 'Keep doing what you have been doing,' which is talking about what matters to families. I think candidates who are too busy looking at the opponents lose sight of what they want to do. I think she should be running the same kind of campaign she's been running for the last three or four months.''</p>
