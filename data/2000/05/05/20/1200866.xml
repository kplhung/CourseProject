        <p>New details emerged yesterday about the last months and hours of a tiny, severely disabled 5-year-old girl who was discovered dead in her family's Bronx apartment Wednesday morning, but investigators were still scrambling to answer the central questions surrounding the death: just how well the child's mother had cared for her, and whether the city's child welfare agency had taken adequate action to protect her.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said yesterday that the mother, Ebony Carzan, had told investigators how she, two other adults who lived in her home and even her 7-year-old daughter had struggled daily to adequately feed the child, Ahsianea, who had cerebral palsy. They processed foods and prepared bottles, Ms. Carzan told investigators.</p>
        <p>A preliminary report on Thursday by the chief medical examiner's office noted signs of acute malnutrition. But the mother proved to investigators that Ahsianea had been seen by a doctor at Lincoln Hospital in November, and that no alarms had been sounded about the girl's condition.</p>
        <p>Yesterday investigators were still trying to reconcile the mother's claims with the grim scene they encountered early Wednesday in a sixth-floor apartment at the Patterson Houses in the Melrose section of the Bronx: a 17-pound dead girl, clothed only in a diaper and with roach bites across her body. There was no food in the refrigerator, and the apartment was a shambles.</p>
        <p>The police and prosecutors in the Bronx detained Ms. Carzan for more than 24 hours before releasing her on Thursday night. Prosecutors said they would await the outcome of a full autopsy before deciding whether to formally charge the mother.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carzan, 24, would not answer questions yesterday about her child's death, other than to complain about the news media's portrayal of her. She also said that the child's father and grandmother, who said they had long complained to child welfare and Family Court officials that Ms. Carzan was abusing and neglecting her children, were liars.</p>
        <p>The child's father, Casiem Brown, 29, is estranged from Ms. Carzan.</p>
        <p>Investigators were still trying to pinpoint exactly when Ahsianea's life ended, noting that they could only say that she had been dead for ''several hours'' when emergency medical service workers arrived at the house at 5:26 a.m. Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The child's paternal grandmother, Alberta Hanley, said that two of her son's children, Savaisa, 7, and her brother Caseim Jr., 6, arrived at her Harlem home at 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, having been brought by Ms. Carzan's brother. When Savaisa told her ''We're here because Ahsianea is dead,'' Ms. Hanley called her son in Brooklyn, and then called Ms. Carzan's apartment in the Bronx, according to a police official, asking: ''Is that baby dead? Is that baby dead?'' Then she called 911.</p>
        <p>When the police arrived at the apartment, Ms. Carzan was gone, having fled the home with her 16-month-old son, Josen, a few minutes earlier, according to the police official. At 7 p.m. Wednesday, she turned herself in to the police at the 40th Precinct station house. According to investigators, Ms. Carzan said she fled because she feared that child welfare officials would take her children, and indeed she had a lengthy history with the agency.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanley, the grandmother of Savaisa, Casiem Jr., and Ahsianea, said she had been trying to get help from child welfare officials since Savaisa was a toddler. In February 1999, Ms. Hanley sent a lengthy e-mail message to the city's Administration for Children's Services, detailing her concerns about her grandchildren.</p>
        <p>But at that point, a child welfare investigation into Ms. Carzan was already open, the result of a Family Court petition by Mr. Brown in the fall of 1998 to gain custody of his children on the grounds that their mother was neglecting them.</p>
        <p>That investigation found that the children were receiving ''adequate care,'' and referred Ms. Carzan to the Puerto Rican Association for Community Affairs, a foster care and social services agency with a checkered past.</p>
        <p>It is not clear what, if any, services Ms. Carzan sought or received: her case was closed last August; soon after, the Puerto Rican Association ceased operating.</p>
        <p>In October, Mr. Brown, who is facing criminal charges in Bronx County for assaulting Ms. Carzan the month before, returned to Family Court, and child welfare officials opened another investigation. That may have been what prompted Ms. Carzan's visit to Lincoln Hospital with Ahsianea in November.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner for children's services, pointed to that visit yesterday, saying, ''If a doctor did not conclude that there was abuse or neglect, it's hard to fault the caseworker.''</p>
        <p>But Arlene Goldsmith, the executive director of New Alternatives for Children, which provides services for medically fragile children and their families, said she was surprised that the agency never referred Ms. Carzan to her organization. Even parents with ample resources struggle in caring for severely disabled children, she said.</p>
        <p>''It does seem to me that this family didn't have adequate medical care,'' Ms. Goldsmith said.</p>
