        <p>Just before his wedding in 1985, Mark Lesser priced a honeymoon in Paris. Even though the dollar was stronger then than at any time since the early 1970's, the trip was out of the question.</p>
        <p>But in August, Mr. Lesser, 37, and his wife, Stacy, will celebrate their 15th anniversary in Paris and Nice.</p>
        <p>''I saw how much further the dollar would go,'' said Mr. Lesser, now the sales director of an Internet software company and a resident of Manalapan, N.J. Fifteen years ago, he said, ''Our income was a quarter of what it is now, so now is just a good time for us.''</p>
        <p>Now seems to be a good time for other American travelers, too. Like the Lessers, many are reveling not only in their increased income, but also in their incredible buying power abroad. The value of the dollar has surged recently against most of the world's currencies, but especially against the euro, which 11 European nations introduced as their common currency in 1999. As the dollar rises, the costs of hotel rooms, restaurants and related items generally decline for Americans, making foreign trips enticing.</p>
        <p>The European Travel Commission, based in Brussels, expects 12 million Americans to visit Europe this year, a 3.5 percent increase from last year and the seventh consecutive annual increase.</p>
        <p>''I have never seen it quite as heavy as this year,'' said Iris Citron, the president of Creative Travel in Springfield, N.J., and Mr. Lesser's travel agent. There is an ''enormous amount of travel to Europe by people who in the past would go on inexpensive cruises or cheaper trips to the Caribbean.''</p>
        <p>Still, low air fares and individual feelings of wealth are driving summer travel plans more than the currency's strength, some travel agents say.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a very big year for Italy, and Paris is packed,'' said Jackie Rush, vice president at Waters Travel in Washington. ''It's only because we are so affluent here; we are so rich.''</p>
        <p>Though travel agents say many of their clients do not realize what a bargain Europe is, some tourists go on spending sprees when they see how far their dollars will go. Savvy travelers pay for their hotels after they arrive, when they can more easily take advantage of rates quoted in the local currency instead of buying travel packages in dollars, said Ralph Ferrara, president of Schneider Travel, a small agency in Butler, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The dollar generally peaked in 1985, but it has surpassed or reached its levels then against a few of the 11 currencies that the euro is replacing. So far this year, the dollar has gained 12.2 percent against the euro. And it is up 16.5 percent since last summer, making a significant dent in prices in Continental Europe.</p>
        <p>(Until January 2002, when euro bills and coins will begin to circulate, the individual European currencies are being used for most purchases, although credit card charges and electronic payments are calculated in euros.)</p>
        <p>Against the Portuguese escudo, the dollar has eclipsed its 1985 level.  It is virtually at its 1985 level against the Italian lira and just below its 1985 peak against the Spanish peseta. And it has climbed to levels not seen since the summer of 1986 against the German mark, the French franc and the Dutch guilder.</p>
        <p>The euro ended yesterday at 89.71 cents, just a bit above its record low, making the dollar worth 2,158 lire, 185.45 pesetas, 223.45 escudos, 2.18 marks, 7.31 francs and 2.46 guilders.</p>
        <p>The dollar is moving higher against other major currencies, too,  though the rally has been smaller. It has risen 11.2 percent against the British pound since January and is now the strongest there since the spring of 1994. Against the Canadian dollar, the United States dollar is moving back toward its record high of the summer of 1998. Even against the Japanese yen, it has eked out a small gain recently, though it remains 27 percent below its most recent high in August 1998.</p>
        <p>Though the rise of the dollar against the pound has been enough to cut vacation costs in Britain by 7 percent since last summer, a trip to Canada will still cost about 1 percent more than last summer. And a trip to Japan will be a lot more expensive, with the dollar down more than 9 percent from a year ago.</p>
        <p>The flip side of a stronger dollar, of course, is that it becomes more expensive for others to travel to the United States.</p>
        <p>So far, however, Europeans have not cut back significantly on American travel. According to the latest available data from the United States Commerce Department, tourism from Western Europe grew 5.6 percent in 1999. It was up 11.9 percent from Spain, 7.5 percent from the Netherlands, 4.5 percent from France, 4.4 percent from Germany and 2.5 percent from Italy.</p>
        <p>And the Commerce Department predicted this week that the growth would continue as the economic revival in Europe helps offset the decline in purchasing power from weaker currencies. For this year, the government forecasts that the number of visitors from the Netherlands will increase 6.8 percent from a year ago; Spain, 6.6 percent; France, 5.6 percent; Germany, 4.4 percent; and Italy, 3.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Though final figures on American travel for last year are not yet available, the Commerce Department says the number of Americans traveling by air to Western Europe jumped 7.4 percent in the first three months of 1999 from the comparable period a year earlier. Travel by Americans to all other countries rose 7.7 percent over that period. Preliminary data for the entire year show that 24.6 million Americans traveled overseas by air, excluding trips to Mexico and Canada, for a 6.5 percent increase over 1998.</p>
        <p>People simply have more money in their pockets, said G. Anna Schoeman, an agent with Polk Travel in Denver. Only about 20 percent of her clients mention the dollar's power as a factor in their travel decisions, she said.</p>
        <p>''Incredibly inexpensive air fares are more of a motivation than the strength of the dollar,'' she said. ''When you can go from Denver to London for $450 or Denver to Paris for $500, the strength of the dollar might come up after they purchase their ticket, and maybe even after they arrive in Europe.''</p>
        <p>Laird G. Newman, an analyst with Andersen Consulting, said he was pleasantly surprised after he arranged an April trip to Italy through Ms. Schoeman. ''We did find that the dollar was at the exchange rate'' of 2,000 to 1, ''and we thought, 'That's great,' '' he said. ''We ended up doing a lot and spending a lot and thinking how great the dollar was.''</p>
        <p>As Americans spot bargains in foreign goods, American-made products are becoming more costly to Europeans and others. And some analysts suspect that the strength of the dollar may be cutting into American exports. In 1999, total American goods sold to countries in the European Union rose 1.9 percent, down from gains of 5.9 percent in 1998 and 10.2 percent in 1997.</p>
        <p>Given that much of the world is still rebounding from financial crises in 1997 and 1998, ''The most plausible reason for the decline is the appreciation of the dollar,'' said Gordon Richardson, an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington.</p>
        <p>But it is too early to see a clear pattern, in part because the pickup in economies around the world may be hiding the dollar's effect. Trade data released yesterday showed that American exports rose to record levels in March.</p>
        <p>The increase in short-term interest rates this week by the Federal Reserve has given the dollar yet more support. And the strength of the American economy is attracting foreign investment, which also helps bolster the value of the dollar.</p>
        <p>But the Federal Reserve is intent on slowing the torrid pace of growth of the American economy. Once signs of slowing appear, the dollar should begin slipping. That will cut into the buying power of American travelers. But it may take a real economic slowdown and not just a slip in the currency to stem the tide abroad.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rush, the travel agent in Washington, said, ''I don't believe for one second that the euro going up will slow the flow of Americans going to Europe.''</p>
