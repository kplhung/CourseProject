        <p>Following is a transcript of remarks by Hillary Rodham Clinton in response to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's withdrawal from the Senate race, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>I just finished speaking with the mayor. I called him at the conclusion of his announcement to wish him well, to tell him that I knew this was a difficult decision. And I certainly hope and pray, as I know all New Yorkers do, that he will have a full and speedy recovery. And I appreciated very much the chance to express those feelings and thoughts to him personally.</p>

        <p>You know, as I have said now for many months, this campaign is not about me or about any opponent. It is about the future of our children, our families, our state and our country. That is the common mission that I share with the people of New York. That is the mission that I will keep working toward, talking about and remaining focused on in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>And I appreciate very much the opportunity that I've had and will continue to have to talk with New Yorkers about what they want in a senator and what they hope can be done to help them build better futures for themselves and their children.  THE MAYOR'S DECISION</p>
