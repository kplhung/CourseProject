        <p>The Florida Supreme Court has ruled that the developer of a retirement community does not have to pay fees imposed by the county to defray the cost of school construction.</p>
        <p>Many communities across the country have imposed such one-time assessments, called impact fees, so that developments help pay for the additional services they require.</p>
        <p>Fifteen Florida counties use the fees to raise about $71.4 million a year for new schools, according to the state's School Finance Construction Commission. State officials estimate that about $3 billion a year is needed for school construction.</p>
        <p>The Florida Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Aberdeen, a mobile home community in Ormond Beach, 40 miles north of Orlando, that prohibits children and requires residents to be 55 or older, did not have to pay the fees because it would not need any more schools.</p>
        <p>The Volusia School District, of which Aberdeen is a part, must now pay back $90,000 in fees and interest to the retirement community. Aberdeen sued the school district in 1997, and a lower court judge ruled earlier this year that Aberdeen residents did not have to pay the fees.</p>
        <p>The case has generated interest nationally among home builders, who have objected to impact fees for schools, utilities, roads and other services. In Florida, those fees add $4,000 to $5,000 to the cost of a new home, and Keith Hetrick, a lawyer representing the Florida Home Builders Association, said that ''prices people out of the market.''</p>
        <p>California has the highest impact fees. In the Silicon Valley, the fees add up to $30,000 to the cost of a new home, Mr. Hetrick said.</p>
        <p>Jay Shackford, a spokesman for the National Association of Home Builders in Washington, said impact fees are an ''unfair burden'' for first-time buyers because they pay for services and facilities that benefit the entire community.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shackford said many states no longer imposed school construction fees on housing for older Americans.</p>
        <p>''The ruling will have a critical financial impact on school districts that currently impose school impact fees,'' said Dick Graham, a lawyer representing the Volusia School District, ''and all other counties and school districts that may find the need to impose a school impact fee as a means of raising funds for new school construction.''</p>
        <p>Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association, said counties had for several years had doubts about the reliability of the fees. This case may lead to eliminating them altogether, he said.</p>
        <p>''For counties, they are going to have to look at every project that goes up in the future,'' Mr. Blanton said, ''and gauge whether it genuinely generates students.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hetrick said Aberdeen residents would still have to pay property taxes to the school district.</p>
        <p>Bill Hall, superintendent of the school district, said the ruling separated the community.</p>
        <p>''It allows a community of adults, basically, not to have anything to do with children,'' Mr. Hall said. ''That's potentially disastrous in this  democratic society.''</p>
