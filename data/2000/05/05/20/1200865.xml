        <p>In the most recent in a series of free-speech lawsuits involving the city government, a federal appeals court cleared the way yesterday for an artist to photograph a large group of nude people on a street in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In a split decision, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered a lower court to schedule a time for the photograph, although it said the lower court should apply ''conditions as it deems appropriate to ensure a minimal intrusion on the neighborhood.''</p>

        <p>In the most recent in a series of free-speech lawsuits involving the city government, a federal appeals court cleared the way yesterday for an artist to photograph a large group of nude people on a street in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In a split decision, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered a lower court to schedule a time for the photograph, although it said the lower court should apply ''conditions as it deems appropriate to ensure a minimal intrusion on the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>The artist, Spencer Tunick, is known for taking elaborately posed photographs of naked models in public settings. In past years, he has photographed groups in Central Park and on city streets and bridges. Mr. Tunick has been arrested five times in New York, although all the charges have been dropped. Last year, he was arrested while trying to photograph a group in Times Square.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tunick sued in Federal District Court last July, asking for an order preventing the city from interfering with a planned photo shoot involving 75 to 100 naked people on Madison Street in Lower Manhattan.  His lawyer, Ronald L. Kuby, said Mr. Tunick planned to photograph  tanned and sunburned people beneath a large picture of a lobster that hangs in the area.</p>
        <p>The judge ordered the city to allow the photograph, and city lawyers appealed, arguing that state law prohibited public nudity except in very restricted circumstances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuby argued that the law said artistic expression was exempt from the statute unless the local government -- in this case the City Council -- banned nudity altogether. Mr. Kuby said the City Council had never passed such an ordinance, which he said would ''drive the film industry out of New York and open itself to further constitutional challenges.''</p>
        <p>The federal appeals court referred the interpretation of state law to the New York State Court of Appeals, requesting that it clarify the public nudity statute. The state court declined to clarify the law.</p>
        <p>In yesterday's 2-to-1 decision, the majority ruled that Mr. Tunick's event qualified for the artistic exemption.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuby said yesterday that Mr. Tunick now planned to take a different photograph. Instead of the shot on Madison Street, he intends to photograph the people in East River Park, under the Williamsburg Bridge.</p>
        <p>Daniel S. Connolly, a lawyer for the city, said yesterday that the city had not decided whether to appeal further.</p>
