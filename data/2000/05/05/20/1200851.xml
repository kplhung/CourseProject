        <p>F.T.C. Is Seeking Authority To Protect Privacy Online  Concluding that companies on the Internet have not properly protected the privacy of consumers, the Federal Trade Commission has decided to ask Congress for authority to impose tough consumer privacy safeguards.</p>
        <p>The F.T.C. approved a staff recommendation in an unannounced vote to seek legislation giving it such authority. The action comes as the agency has stepped up investigations of several major Internet companies over their use of consumer data. It represents a sharp departure from the agency's previous policy of relying almost entirely on the industry to police itself. Democratic lawmakers in both the House and Senate, however, said this week that the prospects for final passage of any privacy measure were not strong. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>The F.T.C. approved a staff recommendation in an unannounced vote to seek legislation giving it such authority. The action comes as the agency has stepped up investigations of several major Internet companies over their use of consumer data. It represents a sharp departure from the agency's previous policy of relying almost entirely on the industry to police itself. Democratic lawmakers in both the House and Senate, however, said this week that the prospects for final passage of any privacy measure were not strong. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Nissan Reports $6.3 Billion Loss  Nissan Motor said its loss widened to 684.4 billion yen on a consolidated basis, or $6.3 billion at current exchange rates, in the fiscal year ended March 31. Carlos Ghosn, the company's president, contended that while lower, the sales in fiscal 1999 were more profitable than in the previous year. [C2.]</p>
        <p>China Trade Bill Edges Near Victory  Opponents of a decisive China trade bill refused to admit defeat and vowed to step up their lobbying over the weekend. But growing signs indicated that barring an unforeseen shift in votes or provocation by Beijing against Taiwan, the measure was edging toward victory. House Republican leaders scheduled a vote for Wednesday. [A4.]</p>
        <p>Appeals Court Upholds Cable Law  A federal appeals court upheld the constitutionality of a law that sets limits on the size of a cable company. The ruling strengthens the hand of the government as it reviews AT&amp;T's pending merger with MediaOne. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Intel Revises Earnings Down 1 cents  Intel said that it had revised its first-quarter per-share earnings downward by a penny and had lowered sales by $28 million, disclosing the initial financial hit it would take for circuit boards found earlier this month to have a defective component. [C14.]</p>
        <p>United States Trade Deficit Widens  The United States trade deficit widened to a record in March as surging demand for oil, automobiles and other imports overpowered a second consecutive monthly increase in exports, Commerce Department figures showed. The deficit in goods and services grew to $30.2 billion in March from $28.7 billion in February. Economists had expected a $29.5 billion deficit. Although the United States shortfall with China narrowed, record imports from Japan, Canada and Western Europe caused the trade gaps with those regions to widen. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Korean Traders Plan Monday Strike  Thirty-thousand members of South Korea's securities industry union are planning to strike during their lunch hour Monday, when the stock exchange plans to continue trading during what has historically been a midday break. The change, approved by the South Korean government, makes this country the first in Asia to keep its stock exchange open during the lunch hour. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Softbank Doubles Profit Forecast  Softbank, Japan's largest Internet investor, more than doubled its forecast for its annual earnings. [C2.]</p>
