        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>A GETAWAY FOR THE GORES -- Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, escaped Washington yesterday to spend their 30th wedding anniversary at Bethany Beach in Delaware. The Gores were staying at the beach home of Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's presidential campaign chairman, through Sunday. The couple took a Marine helicopter at taxpayer expense -- a requirement of the Secret Service, a spokesman said. Accompanying them were Mr. Gore's Secret Service detail, a military aide and a press aide, although the White House had not notified reporters of the vice president's travel until yesterday afternoon, after the Gores had left Washington. Mr. Gore last month had told reporters covering his presidential campaign that he would notify them when he traveled, including on his anniversary. ''I will err on the side of openness and full access as much as possible,'' he said. But he apparently had not shared this decision with his wife, who has said she hopes to maintain her family's privacy even if her husband becomes president and in a recent interview questioned why reporters would need to accompany the vice president on private trips.</p>

        <p>BUSH IN KENTUCKY -- Wending his way across Kentucky on a campaign bus, Gov. George W. Bush took his ''compassionate conservatism'' on the road yesterday, calling on the elderly to volunteer. At a center for the elderly in Paducah, Mr. Bush praised retired volunteers who share ''wisdom, experience and values'' as foster grandparents or mentors. He proposed to increase federal financing for such volunteer programs from $183 million a year to $240 million annually across five years. Some of the money would go to a pilot program, under which 10,000 low-income elderly volunteers would earn a $1,000 scholarship for a grandchild or a child of their choice.</p>

        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>GORE WEB SITE ATTACKS BUSH PLAN -- Certain that Governor Bush has handed them the perfect campaign weapon with his Social Security proposal, the Gore campaign unveiled a new Web site this week devoted to attacking his plan. Its not-so-subtle address: www.bushinsecurity.com. The home page features a photograph of rolling dice (Mr. Gore likes to accuse Mr. Bush of promoting ''casino economics'') and a picture of a slightly crazed-looking Mr. Bush over the caption, ''When he was asked if people could lose money under his plan, Bush replied, 'Maybe, maybe not.'' Asked to respond to the Web site, Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said, ''Having invented the Internet, you would have thought Al Gore could have used it for something positive and not just another attack barrage.'' He added that he would check the site to see whether it included a link to the White House Web site that promotes the Clinton administration's proposal to invest Social Security money in the stock market, an idea Mr. Gore once supported.</p>

        <p>CONSERVATIVE NAMED TO N.R.A. BOARD -- Grover G. Norquist, president of a nonprofit anti-tax group called Americans for Tax Reform and a leader in conservative circles, has been elected to the board of the National Rifle Association, Mr. Norquist and N.R.A. officials said. Mr. Norquist has close ties to the Republican Party -- he is a friend of former Speaker Newt Gingrich and accepted $4.6 million in 1996 from the Republican National Committee to flood Congressional districts with literature defending Republican candidates. So his election is viewed by Democrats and gun-control advocates as further evidence of tightening bonds between the Republicans and the N.R.A., which he calls ''the nation's largest civil rights group.'' Joining him on the board will be David Keene, chairman of the American Conservative Union.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>END OF POLITICAL WINDSTORM -- Richard A. Gebhardt, whose sound-alike primary challenge to the House minority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt, had Democrats in a tizzy in recent months, dropped his candidacy, a state spokesman announced yesterday. Mr. Gebhardt, 65, filed paperwork on Thursday withdrawing from the Third District primary and will not appear alongside the congressman on the Aug. 8 ballot, said Jim Grebing, a spokesman for Secretary of State Bekki Cook. ''I stirred up a lot of wind, didn't I?'' Mr. Gebhardt said with a laugh.</p>
