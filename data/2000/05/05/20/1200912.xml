        <p>The Knicks were desperate, playing for their season, doing anything to put the ball in the hole.

        <p>The Knicks were desperate, playing for their season, doing anything to put the ball in the hole. Marcus Camby dunked in a rebound, Patrick Ewing drained a long jump shot from the right wing. The fans at Madison Square Garden, fed up and booing moments earlier, were now agog with noise and disbelief.</p>
        <p>This wasn't happening with four minutes left. They could not possibly pull this off, erase an 18-point second-quarter deficit. Miami was not going to throw this gem of a road game away, the game they had to have to banish all the ghosts of playoffs past, that hole in Pat Riley's stomach.</p>
        <p>Riley could not go back to Miami for a deciding Game 7 again, to the town where his team could not close out the resilient Knicks for two consecutive seasons, to face the team that kept raising questions about his legacy as the game's greatest coach.</p>
        <p>But there stood Allan Houston, the player who hit the magical shot a year ago, knocking down a difficult 18-footer over Dan Majerle. It was no longer 45-30. Suddenly, it was 68-66. The Knicks were within 2, and you could not hear the person next to you.</p>
        <p>Anthony Carter, the Pint-Sized Point Guard Who Could, nailed a jumper from the right baseline, silencing everyone for a few seconds.</p>
        <p>And then Ewing, swooping in from the right wing after a Chris Childs miss, dunked back the rebound over Alonzo Mourning with 1 minute 57 seconds left, showing athleticism no one knew he still possessed.</p>
        <p>''Big Fella,'' Childs said afterward, smiling. ''Young legs.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks could not close this out, come back against this impenetrable defensive team, a team that had them so discombobulated in Game 5 that Ewing and Childs were yelling at each other, right there in the middle of a playoff game.</p>
        <p>Dissension. Chaos. Season on the brink. It was so perfect, everything the Knicks needed, everything they knew. And when Houston's two free throws dropped through with 17.6 seconds left and sent the Garden into pandemonium like no one could quite remember in at least a decade, it all began to make sense.</p>
        <p>Knicks 72, Heat 70.</p>
        <p>Prosperity's underachieving children had once again transformed themselves into adversity's darlings, and anything seemed reachable on a loud night in May in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Fifteen minutes ago, the Knicks were left for dead. You figured you would next see Jeff Van Gundy at a summer league game or a news conference announcing the team's new draft pick. How could anyone expect to see him, Ewing or this persevering team in Miami on Sunday afternoon, playing a Game 7 against a team that had them playing golf midway through the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>How? Easy. It's Knick history.</p>
        <p>In a way, the Game 6 setting could not have been more idyllic. Facing elimination, feuding on the court in Game 5, commotion surrounded the franchise. It seemed all they needed was a front-office shake-up and a clandestine meeting between Dave Checketts, the Garden president, and someone campaigning for Van Gundy's job.</p>
        <p>Backs to the wall. Adversity. All of Greater New York calling sports-talk radio for grief counseling. The entire town down on its team, wondering why John Wallace can get a few minutes.</p>
        <p>Dating to Riley's days here, it is all the franchise seems to know.</p>
        <p>In 1994, they went down, 3 games to 2, to Indiana in the Eastern Conference finals, before rising up and winning the last two. In 1996, with a bunch of a rent-a-Knicks and a coach that was not supposed to make it past the summer, New York swept a favored Cleveland team in the first round and played the Bulls valiantly for five games in the second round.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Knicks entered the playoffs as the seventh-seeded team and stunned Miami in five games. Everyone knows what happened last year, the difference between these two teams.</p>
        <p>One bounce. One running jumper that separated the Heat from the first round and a chance to play for the championship. Mourning, Majerle, Tim Hardaway and their teammates lived with that thought for more than year.</p>
        <p>Out of nowhere, the Knicks summoned their own desire last night, found a way when it mattered most, and sent this incredible rivalry the distance again. What happened to the Knicks against Miami? They would not die. Ewing absorbed catcalls as he plodded through the lane for most of three quarters, trying to make his body listen to his mind.</p>
        <p>In the final 3:21, he hit the jumper, dunked back a rebound, grabbed a defensive rebound and tipped away a pass with 30.6 seconds left. He made the masses want to feel ashamed for ever doubting his ability to perform in the clutch.</p>
        <p>This game was over. But now it's happening all over again. One amazing comeback, and another wild one in Miami tomorrow. The Knicks have taken the Heat's best shots again, and still won't drop.</p>
        <p>During a timeout with 4:19 left in the quarter, after Carter had downed a 3-pointer to give Miami a 13-point lead and triggered a chorus of boos, the Garden scoreboard showed a Great Moments in Knick History clip. What else? Willis Reed knocking down those two jump shots in Game 7 of the 1970 finals.</p>
        <p>How far away that moment seemed in the second half. Yes, it's too early to draw comparisons, too premature to put this team on one of those destiny courses. But the way the Knicks picked themselves up last night, the way they matched the desire of Riley's team with their own, it made you think about the impossible -- and booking that flight to Miami, the reservation you didn't need about 15 minutes ago.</p>
        <p>Chaos. Dissension. Season on the brink. Game 7. It really is too perfect.</p>
