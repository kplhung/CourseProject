        <p>With Rudolph W. Giuliani bowing out of the race for the United States Senate, this could have been a day for Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, to savor, a day when she might have stepped into the limelight as the Republican Party's next best hope.</p>
        <p>Instead, she was stuck in a federal courtroom, seated dutifully behind her husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., who is standing trial on charges of tax fraud, accused with conspiring to deduct more than $1 million in personal expenses as tax write-offs.</p>
        <p>The trial -- featuring one of Westchester County's leading power brokers, Mr. Pirro, and his poisoned relationship with his brother, Anthony Pirro, who was also his accountant -- is dramatic enough. But the most riveting subtext to the trial is the plight of Ms. Pirro, who has long been mentioned as a candidate for higher office and now finds herself trying to avoid the fallout from the trial.</p>
        <p>Nobody seems more aware of that than Ms. Pirro, whose trademark suits appeared to reflect the mood this week, their colors shifting from powder blue and rose-petal pink to more somber grays and mochas. Today, all Ms. Pirro would say when asked about Mr. Giuliani's announcement was that she hoped ''that a strong candidate is selected.'' She added, ''Right now, my focus is on this case and my family and my job -- which I love.''</p>
        <p>But last week, while bantering with reporters at a court hearing, Ms. Pirro was asked whether she might step in for Mr. Giuliani if he were to withdraw. ''Not in this life,'' she blurted, a trace of bitterness in her voice.</p>
        <p>In the long run, political analysts from the Democratic and Republican Parties say, Ms. Pirro's strengths could overcome any of her husband's liabilities, despite a trial that has provided intimate glimpses of the family finances and has threatened to implicate her. Even if Mr. Pirro, Westchester's most prominent real estate lawyer, is convicted, they say, Ms. Pirro could survive, depending on what comes out during the trial. ''She's a dynamic woman with a lot of charisma and a lot of intelligence,'' said Marc Bloom, a Democratic consultant in Westchester County. ''That's always going to make her formidable, and that's why I don't count her out.''</p>
        <p>As she has bounced between the Westchester County Courthouse, where she oversees a staff of 117 lawyers, and the United States Courthouse down the street, Ms. Pirro was all confidence this week, appearing at turns feisty and charming.</p>
        <p>One minute she was the concerned wife, lashing out at prosecutors for invading her family's privacy. The next minute she was holding an impromptu news conference, declaring victory in a continuing investigation into pedophiles on the Internet. In between, she joked with reporters in an elevator about her family's pet potbellied pigs. ''You mean it's not in the indictment?'' she said when asked the pigs' names.</p>
        <p>That ability to separate her public and private lives is what makes her an effective politician, friends and analysts say. ''She's a trouper and a fighter and a professional,'' said Michael R. Edelman, a Republican consultant and former Westchester County prosecutor who is a close friend of the Pirros.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edelman, who has vacationed with the Pirros at their home in West Palm Beach, Fla., believes that in the future voters will judge Ms. Pirro, 48, on her own record. ''Hillary Clinton hasn't suffered,'' he said. ''She was nominated by acclamation for the U.S. Senate, and her husband was impeached and is on the verge of losing his law license.''</p>
        <p>Others say the alleged misdeeds of the husband, proved or not, will haunt the wife forever.</p>
        <p>''If he's convicted, she's pretty much finished,'' said John J. McCann, a political scientist at Pace University. ''If he's acquitted, her future is not as dark, obviously. But this is going to be a problem for the rest of her political career.''</p>
        <p>Today, for a third straight day, Ms. Pirro attended her husband's trial, occupying the front row, flanked by her mother and family friends. For the first time, she looked unnerved as prosecutors projected photograph after photograph of the family's Italianate mansion and swimming pool.</p>
        <p>As was the case previously, prosecutors summoned contractors who detailed various home-improvement projects at the Pirros' home in Harrison, from a $45,000 electronic fence around the property to a $3,700 awning. And once again, prosecutors tried to solidify their argument that all of these contractors were paid by Mr. Pirro's companies for work that was personal, not business.</p>
        <p>While the trial entered a phase of presenting reams of evidence, local Republican leaders had their minds elsewhere, wistfully thinking what might have been.</p>
        <p>''She would have been a leading candidate, perhaps the leading candidate'' to replace Mr. Giuliani, said James Cavanaugh, chairman of the Westchester County Republican Committee. ''The timing could not be worse.''</p>
