        <p>IF there is one thing that unites all racing people, it is the fervent prayer that their stagnant industry will develop a great four-legged hope, a Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretzky of the equine set.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice to see a horse on the cover of Time magazine,'' said Joe Orseno, the trainer of Red Bullet.</p>
        <p>But the trainers do not necessarily want that great horse to emerge at their expense in today's Preakness.</p>
        <p>''It is,'' reminded Bob Baffert, the trainer of Captain Steve, ''a $1 million race.''</p>
        <p>There is money to be won out there this afternoon, and the seven rival trainers have all tried to think of reasons Fusaichi Pegasus might not be the first Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978.</p>
        <p>They are already coping with the great burst of energy from Fusaichi Pegasus in the stretch run at the Kentucky Derby. Racing has not felt that power since Secretariat flew home in the 1973 Belmont, or so it seems in a sport burdened with nostalgia and the inroads made by other forms of gambling.</p>
        <p>Still, the trainers would like to think the horse is, after all, only human.</p>
        <p>''They say he ran a good Derby, but so did 125 other horses,'' said D. Wayne Lukas, the trainer of High Yield, recalling the previous Derby winners, including his own in 1999. ''Charismatic ran a good Derby, too, but people said it was a fluke. The fact is he won.''</p>
        <p>Lukas seemed to be working himself into a theory that any Derby winner is, by definition, a great horse until proven otherwise. High Yield's vantage point is from 15th place in the Derby, not even close enough to have heard the thunder from Fusaichi Pegasus.</p>
        <p>It's hard for Lukas to bad-mouth the Derby winner, since he had entered the bidding for him in the yearling sales, willing to go close to $2 million. Then he spotted Fusao Sekiguchi, the flamboyant Japanese entrepreneur, double-jumping the bids in increments of $200,000 at a time, and he realized, ''He was in it till the bell rang,'' which it did at $4 million.</p>
        <p>There are no secrets about this horse. Now the seven brave trainers try to become the man who shot Liberty Valance. Nobody remembers the name of the good guy in the epic western, only the epic gunslinger who was shot down.</p>
        <p>''His Derby win was pretty special,'' Baffert said of Fusaichi Pegasus, ''but Kent Desormeaux never had to throttle him down.''</p>
        <p>The jockey won the Derby essentially by letting Fusaichi Pegasus do what comes naturally to him. So the trainers focus on the colt's reputation for skittishness.</p>
        <p>''He runs and he stops, he runs and he stops,'' said Orseno, talking about the six-segment workout on Thursday.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure Neil would like to get him a good workout,'' Orseno added, noting how Neil Drysdale, the trainer, has kept the colt in relative seclusion on the backstretch.</p>
        <p>While the seven other Preakness horses are subject to close inspections by reporters, photographers, camera crews, other owners and trainers, assorted friends and hangers-on, tourists and gaggles of schoolchildren, Fusaichi Pegasus remains in isolation.</p>
        <p>''Neil knows what he's doing,'' Orseno conceded. ''But there is a mental part to racing. The horse has been on a van, a ramp, a plane, takeoff and landing. It's not normal for a horse to do it, although they do it. That's how they get here. But it's not normal. Then coming out here to race in front of 100,000 people could mess with his mind -- not that horses have too big of a mind.''</p>
        <p>That's exactly the point. The horse mainly knows that once in a while they let him out in the open, where he can run. Generally, he makes the most of it.</p>
        <p>''I heard somebody say that the horse is 3-5 to win -- but 5-2 to get in the gate,'' Orseno said, somewhat hopefully.</p>
        <p>The record shows that the handlers managed to get Fusaichi Pegasus into the starting gate in Kentucky two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>''A man among boys,'' Baffert admitted. ''If he runs like that again, we're all in trouble.</p>
        <p>''If I don't win, I hope he does,'' Baffert added, not needing to note that it would mean his dear friend Lukas -- they call each other Lukas and Baffert -- would not win.</p>
        <p>''But I've had plenty of good horses that stubbed their toes,'' Baffert concluded.</p>
        <p>The trainers searched for obstacles for Fusaichi Pegasus. Mud is a great equalizer. Horses can be thrown off by small fields. The colt may not bounce back after only two weeks of rest. The name is difficult to pronounce. He has been having a nervous breakdown in private in the backstretch. You never know.</p>
        <p>They look for hope. They don't sound very convincing, but they try.</p>
