        <p>Just as a breakthrough in the long deadlock over guerrilla disarmament is at hand, the Northern Ireland peace effort is falling back into the grip of politically charged symbols, which have often been as divisive as firearms.</p>
        <p>The Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, has postponed a crucial meeting Saturday of his ruling council for a week. That is to give him time to persuade the party to endorse an Irish Republican Army offer to permit international inspections of its secret arms dumps.</p>
        <p>Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, told the BBC today that the importance of the vote could not be overstated.</p>
        <p>''The choice that the Ulster Unionists are going to make next Saturday is going to determine the course of Northern Ireland politics, its political stability and also its economic prosperity for a generation to come,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Acceptance would speed the return of the power-sharing home rule government in Belfast that was suspended in February after the I.R.A. failed to make expected moves on arms. But on May 5, the I.R.A. said it would permit the inspections of its arsenals by international figures, would re-engage with an international commission on disarmament and would ''completely and verifiably put I.R.A. arms beyond use.''</p>
        <p>In the days to come, Mr. Trimble will be lobbying his own party to treat the I.R.A. pledge as the long-sought promise of disarmament, and to support him in his desire to return to government with the party's Catholic rival, Sinn Fein.</p>
        <p>Refusal would deliver the two-year-old peace accord its most serious setback and would likely end the leadership of Mr. Trimble, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who is viewed as the only Protestant politician able to turn the party from its rejectionist past.</p>
        <p>It is a fight for the heart and soul of the Ulster Unionists, but the debate is now turning as much on issues like what flag flies atop government buildings, what name the new police force bears and what symbols end up on the officers' uniforms as much as it is on weapons and secret armies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble spent the past week trying to exact clarifications and concessions on these points before announcing Thursday night that he was postponing the ruling council vote. Prime Minister Tony Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said: ''We have come to the end of that process this week. We have set out the position in terms of flags. We have, we believe, gone some way to meeting concerns in terms of policing and names.''</p>
        <p>At issue are reforms dropping the name Royal Ulster Constabulary for the province's police force and calling it instead the Police Service of Northern Ireland, abandoning national insignias from the caps and badges of officers and permitting officials of the power-sharing administration to decide whether to fly the British flag, the Irish flag or no flag at all above government buildings.</p>
        <p>These kinds of emblems are freighted in Ulster, where Protestant communities mark their boundaries with Union Jacks and red-white-and-blue curbstones, and Catholic neighborhoods hoist the Irish tricolor and promote the wearing of the green.  The most contested declarations of differences are the summer parades of members of the militantly Protestant Orange Order, who march through resentful Catholic neighborhoods, sporting their black bowler hats, white gloves and bright orange regalia. Seen as acts of triumphalist defiance by Catholics, the marches commemorate battles three centuries ago in which the Protestant King William defeated the Catholic King James.</p>
        <p>Unionists, who are generally Protestant, are so called because they believe in keeping Northern Ireland part of the United Kingdom. Republicans, almost all of whom are Roman Catholics, want to see Northern Ireland become closer to and eventually part of the Irish Republic to the south.</p>
        <p>The conflict between the two ''traditions'' has grown over the past three decades, causing more than 3,600 deaths and prompting periodic and ultimately failed efforts at a settlement apportioning power more fairly among the Protestant majority and Catholic minority. The current accord, struck in April 1998, has raised the greatest hope of a real resolution, but putting it into effect has encountered continual setbacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble has long faced opposition from a significant hard-line minority in his party who, in a stance known as ''no guns, no government,'' insist on I.R.A. disarmament as a condition for sharing government with Sinn Fein.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the I.R.A. announcement, Mr. Trimble's persuasive deputy, John Taylor, predicted the party would overwhelmingly accept it. But last week he said the British government's insistence on going through with the police name and badge changes and its position on flags had cast the matter into doubt. Unhappiness over the changes in symbols has for the moment turned that minority into a majority, causing Mr. Trimble to delay the reckoning. It is not known now whether Mr. Taylor himself will back his leader next Saturday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble received support today from an unlikely source, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. In unusually conciliatory language Mr. Adams said, ''I fully understand why the unionist people are suspicious and distrustful of republicans,'' and added that he would ''vehemently oppose any political arrangement that discriminated against the unionist people.'' He appealed to ''the rank and file of the U.U.P.'' to work together with republicans ''as equals'' to achieve a better future for Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>The comment prompted Ian Paisley, the firebrand preacher who is the peace agreement's most vocal opponent, to say that Mr. Trimble had now become ''the chief salesman of the I.R.A.''</p>
