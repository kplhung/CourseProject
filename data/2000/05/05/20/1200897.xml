        <p>Cherie Blair, 45, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, 47, gave birth to a baby boy at a London hospital early today.</p>
        <p>''Both mother and baby are doing well,'' a 10 Downing Street spokesman said in a brief statement. ''Both the prime minister and Mrs. Blair are delighted.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Blair went to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on Friday morning, and Mr. Blair followed in the late afternoon. There was no word of a name for the baby, whose due date was May 24.</p>
        <p>The baby is the couple's fourth child and the first to be born to a sitting prime minister in 152 years. Their other children are Euan, 16, Nicky, 14, and Kathryn, 12.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Blair, a prominent employment rights lawyer, worked up until the last few days, appearing on Tuesday in the High Court to argue a case for the Trade Unions Congress that challenged the way Mr. Blair's government has introduced parental leave benefits.</p>
        <p>The new law, modeled on a European Union directive, gives parents the right to take 13 weeks off during the first five years of their child's life, but the Blair government has restricted the benefit to parents of children born after Dec. 15, 1999. Mrs. Blair, who practices under her unmarried name, Cherie Booth, told the justices that the limit unlawfully excluded 2.7 million people who were already parents of children under 5.</p>
        <p>The matter of parental leave became an issue for the Blairs when she noted in a speech to a legal group in London the experience of the Finnish prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, 59, who took a week out of the office  to spend with his newborn daughter in March. Mrs. Blair pointedly encouraged the ''widespread adoption'' of Mr. Lipponen's ''fine example.''</p>
        <p>Attention turned to Mr. Blair, who let his decision on how he would react be known in an interview in last Sunday's New York Times Magazine. ''I know what people want me to say,'' he said, ''but the truth is if I went away and stopped taking calls or having any conversations, it just wouldn't be real.''</p>
        <p>''I'll take more time off,'' he said. ''I'll try to cut down on official things. You've got to have some common sense about it -- you want to spend more time with your baby, but you don't give up the job.''</p>
