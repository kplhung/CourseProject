        <p>The National Rifle Association plans to open a theme restaurant and a game arcade in Times Square, a move that has outraged gun-control advocates and astonished redevelopment officials.</p>
        <p>At its national convention yesterday in Charlotte, N.C., the N.R.A. said it was negotiating to open a restaurant called NRASports Grille, featuring ''a wild game menu and fresh mineral waters from around the world.'' The group said it also planned an adjacent electronic-game arcade and gift store called NRASports Blast, which it described as ''an exciting total shooting sports and sporting goods experience.''</p>

        <p>The National Rifle Association plans to open a theme restaurant and a game arcade in Times Square, a move that has outraged gun-control advocates and astonished redevelopment officials.</p>
        <p>At its national convention yesterday in Charlotte, N.C., the N.R.A. said it was negotiating to open a restaurant called NRASports Grille, featuring ''a wild game menu and fresh mineral waters from around the world.'' The group said it also planned an adjacent electronic-game arcade and gift store called NRASports Blast, which it described as ''an exciting total shooting sports and sporting goods experience.''</p>
        <p>William Powers, the N.R.A.'s director of public affairs, was not specific about the plans for the Times Square project in a telephone interview. But he compared it to ventures by the World Wrestling Federation, which has a Times Square restaurant and gift store, and Planet Hollywood, the pop-culture theme restaurant on West 57th Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers said the gift store would not sell guns.</p>
        <p>The N.R.A.'s plans quickly drew criticism. ''This is ludicrous,'' said Kimberly Mariani, a spokeswoman for Handgun Control, a lobbying group in Washington. ''The very New Yorkers who have worked to reduce their crime rate don't want the N.R.A. coming into Times Square and glorifying the gun culture. Now, not only their policies will leave a bad taste in your mouth, but their food as well.''</p>
        <p>Brendan Sexton, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, which provides business consulting, security and other services to businesses in Times Square, said he was surprised by the N.R.A.'s plans, which were first reported yesterday by The Daily News, and expressed mixed feelings.</p>
        <p>''They're entitled to be in Times Square and it's my job to treat them as a neighbor,'' Mr. Sexton said. ''But symbolically and philosophically, it's very hard to look on a business whose focus is shooting and feel that this is a happy development.''</p>
        <p>Real estate brokers familiar with Times Square who said they were not involved in the negotiations said the N.R.A. has been looking for space for more than a year and that its interest has focused on 1530 Broadway, near 45th Street, the site of the Criterion movie theater and Sbarro, an Italian-food cafeteria. That block of Broadway also has some of Times Square's most prominent billboards, including Liz Claiborne and Jockey.</p>
        <p>Charles Moss, Jr., an owner of B. S. Moss Enterprises, the landlord of 1530 Broadway, denied that he was negotiating with the N.R.A. ''I've never spoken to them and I would not be interested in speaking to them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A broker who is said to be familiar with the negotiations described the N.R.A. as seeking 45,000 to 55,000 square feet on at least two floors, one of them at street level.</p>
        <p>Rents for that area run $275 to $300 per square foot on street level and $50 a foot for basement or second-floor space. At those rates, that broker said, the N.R.A. might pay annual rent of more than $7 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers would not confirm that the group was looking at 1530 Broadway, but said that the figure of $7 million was not daunting and that the N.R.A. was determined to develop the project.</p>
        <p>''Rent like that didn't stop the W.W.F. or Planet Hollywood and it won't stop us,'' Mr. Powers said. The N.R.A. has 3.6 million members and an annual operating budget of $150 million.</p>
