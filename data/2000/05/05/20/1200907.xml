        <p>Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani's withdrawal from Senate race changes climate for future mayoral contest in New York City; comments from four potential Democratic mayoral candidates: New York City Public Advocate Mark Green, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, City Comptroller Alan Hevesi and Bronx Boro Pres Fernando Ferrer (M)</p>

        <p>They wished Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani well after he withdrew from the Senate race yesterday, but for a quartet of Democrats aspiring to replace him, the real news was the altered electoral landscape for next year, not this one. Or rather, the changed fortunes of Mark Green, the mayor-in-waiting who will now remain in waiting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green, the public advocate, who under the City Charter would have become mayor had Mr. Giuliani gone to Washington before his term ended, called reporters to his office to tell them that he was not disappointed by the turn of events. Mr. Green insisted, as he has for months, that he had never wanted Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, to beat Hillary Rodham Clinton just so he could serve as mayor for one year before the 2001 elections.</p>
        <p>''Everyone who has spoken to me about this in the last year,'' Mr. Green said, ''every member of my family, friends, colleagues, journalists know that I did not hope and I did not expect to become mayor merely by succession because of how hard I was working for Hillary Clinton and frankly how much I expected she would win.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Green's rivals -- Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone, City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi and Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president -- were not so sure. Publicly, their aides demurred when asked about politics. Behind the scenes, there were sighs of relief, for it is more difficult to oust a sitting mayor, whose advantages include the ability to raise contributions from people doing business with City Hall.</p>
        <p>Still, now that Mr. Green has been denied status as the automatic front-runner, the mayoral race could turn more tumultuous and unpredictable, with other candidates jumping in. After Mr. Giuliani's announcement, the Rev. Al Sharpton, who ran unexpectedly strong in the 1997 Democratic mayoral primary, said he was considering entering the race in 2001.</p>
        <p>All four current contenders are on the move politically because of term limits, which will force Mr. Giuliani from office in 2001 and require Mr. Green, Mr. Vallone, Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Ferrer to seek new jobs as well.</p>
        <p>Even as the spotlight has focused on the Senate contest, the four men have been engaged in something of a shadow campaign, building alliances, raising money and trying to sketch out themes that will lead to victory in the Democratic primary in September 2001. No prominent Republicans have stepped forward to run, suggesting that the winner of the Democratic primary will get the job.</p>
        <p>The possibility that Mr. Giuliani would leave office early had injected a degree of uncertainty into the race, with some candidates fearful that Mr. Green would be difficult to dislodge. Some political analysts pointed out, though, that the candidates could have used any missteps by a Mayor Green as fodder for attacks.</p>
        <p>Now the four man are on even footing, though at least publicly, their campaigns said they cared little about Mr. Giuliani's withdrawal.</p>
        <p>''We always felt that the 2001 mayoral race would come down to the candidate who is the best qualified and has the best experience and vision for the city,'' said Hank Morris, Mr. Hevesi's chief strategist. (That candidate would be Mr. Hevesi, Mr. Morris helpfully added.)</p>
        <p>Michael S. Clendenin, Mr. Vallone's spokesman, said, ''This doesn't change anything.''</p>
        <p>The man most affected by the news, Mr. Green, sought to steer his comments away from politics toward his often rancorous relations with Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>At his news conference, the mayor indicated that having cancer had changed his views on life, and said he would pursue a less rough-edged style of governance. Mr. Green said he had called the mayor afterward and told him that his comments were courageous.</p>
        <p>''The two of us agreed that now we would really work harder to work better together on government issues on behalf of the city,'' he said.</p>
