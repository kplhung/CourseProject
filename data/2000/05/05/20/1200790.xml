        <p>Jazz, especially in New York, is a music of cool tact: the code of conduct among musicians and audiences is to remain impassive even when faced with ecstatic surprises.

        <p>This year's festival was the fifth, and the second one open to high schools across the country. There were fifteen finalist bands out of 176 contenders, and 1,890 schools were sent entry materials. If a school requests the music and doesn't enter the competition, it's still left with a number of free, accurate, new transcriptions of Ellington's arrangements -- essentially, seeds for growing good school bands, which were  scarce until a few years ago.</p>

        <p>Jazz, especially in New York, is a music of cool tact: the code of conduct among musicians and audiences is to remain impassive even when faced with ecstatic surprises. But it takes the annual Essentially Ellington High School Band Competition and Festival, put on by Jazz at Lincoln Center, to remind you of what live jazz can bring out of people before they acquire that outer layer: stomping, screaming, standing up and waving arms in the air.</p>
        <p>This year's festival was the fifth, and the second one open to high schools across the country. There were fifteen finalist bands out of 176 contenders, and 1,890 schools were sent entry materials. If a school requests the music and doesn't enter the competition, it's still left with a number of free, accurate, new transcriptions of Ellington's arrangements -- essentially, seeds for growing good school bands, which were  scarce until a few years ago.</p>
        <p>Last weekend the finalists convened at Lincoln Center for a few days of rehearsals, workshops and jam sessions. And on Monday night the top three bands -- Hall High School of West Hartford, Conn.; New World School of the Arts from Miami, and Roosevelt High School of Seattle -- performed in Avery Fisher Hall. Each band played two Ellington numbers, with Wynton Marsalis sitting in for a trumpet solo with all three finalists.</p>
        <p>Hall High School, led by Haig Shahverdian, has been a finalist three times in the past, and though all bands have to play the core of the song, the Hall band tends toward alternative introductions and tricky arrangements. In the 12-bar channel of ''The Mooche,'' for instance, the brass section sassily dragged its rhythm, making the melody line touch down in strange places. In solos, Erica Von Kleist on clarinet and Drew Sayers on tenor saxophone served notice of their maturity -- Mr. Sayers with advanced, altered harmonies that suggested James Moody and Ms. Von Kleist with strong lines, faultless intonation and a dynamics-rich narrative -- more than one expects, certainly, from players so young.</p>
        <p>Both of the other bands chose to play ''The Shepherd (Who Watches Over the Night Flock),'' written by Ellington in the late 1960's for the Rev. John Gensel of St. Peter's Church in New York. It's a piece that has room for invention: the beginning is a long piano solo, which can influence the mood of the rest of it.  The pianist, Adam Turner from the New World school, played a slow, expressive, preaching blues, full of gospel rhetoric, and Mr. Marsalis followed with a bravura solo.</p>
        <p>The Roosevelt band's performance of the same piece was different.  The pianist, Brian Kinsella, began by playing only seven notes, then took a long pause; onlookers and musicians in the crowd, almost as an involuntary response, shouted ''take your time!'' He dawdled and declaimed even more than Mr. Turner had, working in low, dramatic tremolo chords, quiet, high single-note trickles and dissonant chords and drones to break up the chord cycle. He gave the band something to think about.  Mr. Marsalis responded at full force with a brilliant, crackling blues improvisation, mottling his sound with his plunger-mute; it was to the point.</p>
        <p>The band also used a vocalist, and Sarah Gazarek's dry, grainy performance of ''I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' combined with the alto saxophonist Alex Mabe's whispery, Johnny Hodges-like delivery, made a completely convincing team, one of the special hook-ups between musicians that rise out of all the best big bands. ''Professional'' isn't the word; this performance was sublime.</p>
        <p>The winners had already been decided by earlier performances on Sunday and Monday; Monday evening's performance was for the benefit of the public. The audience learned, after a rousing performance of more Ellington music by the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra -- a band that gets better and better -- that Hall High School had won, with New World coming in second and Roosevelt third. If it was a surprising result based on the particulars of the Monday night performance, it made the point that high school jazz bands, like their grown-up counterparts, have their good nights, and then they have their great ones.</p>
