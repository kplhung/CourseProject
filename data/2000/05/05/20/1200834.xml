        <p>Chinese and European negotiators agreed today on the terms of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>The European Union's trade commissioner, Pascal Lamy, toasted China's foreign trade minister, Shi Guangsheng, over the deal at the ministry's imposing headquarters in Beijing just hours after Prime Minister Zhu Rongji had stepped in to help conclude the talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shi told reporters that the deal embodied ''the principle of equality, friendship and mutual benefit'' between China and the European Union. It is one of the final steps  clearing the way for China's entry to the trade organization this year.</p>
        <p>Both sides scrambled to reach the agreement before the vote in Washington next week on whether the United States will grant China permanent normal trading status, abolishing what Beijing considers a humiliating annual review of its worthiness as a trading partner.</p>
        <p>China's agreement with the Europeans is the last major step before it can join the global body, which regulates trade between most countries. Many people think that the deal will add momentum to the Clinton administration's last-ditch effort to get the trade legislation passed.</p>
        <p>The United States vowed to make China's trade status permanent as part of its deal last year on the terms of China's entry into the World Trade Organization. If Congress votes against the permanent status, China is still expected to join but can then exclude the United States from benefits it extends other countries in the trade organization.</p>
        <p>Negotiations with the European Union over China's membership terms had broken down three times this year as the Europeans sought to push the Chinese beyond the concessions they had granted the United States in a deal signed last year.</p>
        <p>Trade organization candidates must complete separate agreements with any member country that asks, outlining the market-opening measures they will make to join.</p>
        <p>After five fruitless days, the talks here seemed to be in danger of failing again as the Europeans held out for control of some telecommunications networks. The union had been seeking 51 percent ownership of cellular networks, while China, under its deal with the United States, had agreed to allow 49 percent foreign investment in most telecommunication services and 50 percent foreign ownership of value-added services, including the Internet.</p>
        <p>Talks between Mr. Lamy and Mr. Shi continued late Thursday evening, and the two men met again this morning before Prime Minister Zhu summoned Mr. Lamy to China's walled leadership compound. In the end, the Europeans abandoned their demands and accepted some expansion in the kinds of telecommunications services covered by the agreement and some acceleration in carrying out the new ownership rules, although details were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Terms agreed to with any one trade organization member must be extended to all members, and Chinese negotiators were under pressure not to go beyond the wide concessions granted to the United States at the end of two years of negotiations last year. Those concessions are already vilified by many Chinese officials, who say they will put struggling industries at too great a disadvantage to powerful multinationals eager to expand business here.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Zhu and other Chinese reformers want the trade organization rules as a tool to force change in areas protected by domestic political interests.</p>
        <p>The 15-member European Union had been the largest of six remaining trade organization members that had not yet concluded the separate market-access agreements necessary for Beijing's membership. Agreements with the remaining countries is expected to be a formality, though Switzerland or Mexico could yet slow the process with additional demands, diplomats warned.</p>
        <p>China has been trying to join the trade organization or its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, since July 1986. And despite the agreement today, it will take months more for China to actually join. A trade organization working party must first consolidate the agreements Beijing has signed with various countries into a single document outlining the terms of its membership, for instance. And China must provide the organization with a clear accounting of its current trade rules and a schedule of when specific rules will change to comply with the membership terms.</p>
        <p>Officials of the trade organization at its headquarters in Geneva said the process would probably not be completed until October.</p>
