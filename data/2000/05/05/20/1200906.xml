        <p>After 24 years with the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, the team's president and general manager, announced his resignation yesterday. The only question now is whether he will end up in New York or Phoenix, running either the Rangers or the Coyotes.</p>
        <p>Sather, 56, is the Rangers' first choice for their vacant team presidency. Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, who has already met twice with Sather, will most likely attempt to arrange a third meeting in the next few days, said a person familiar with the Garden's thinking.</p>

        <p>After 24 years with the Edmonton Oilers, Glen Sather, the team's president and general manager, announced his resignation yesterday. The only question now is whether he will end up in New York or Phoenix, running either the Rangers or the Coyotes.</p>
        <p>Sather, 56, is the Rangers' first choice for their vacant team presidency. Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, who has already met twice with Sather, will most likely attempt to arrange a third meeting in the next few days, said a person familiar with the Garden's thinking.</p>
        <p>Checketts's time frame may be affected by Wayne Gretzky's plans. Gretzky, who played for Sather in Edmonton, Alberta, and is good friends with him, is mulling an offer to become the majority owner in Phoenix and could try to persuade Sather to go with him.</p>
        <p>The Oilers' general manager for the last 21 years, Sather gave up his positions yesterday morning, forfeiting the last two years of a contract that would have paid him almost $2 million a year.</p>
        <p>''I am a free agent,'' Sather said at last night's news conference in Edmonton after announcing his resignation. ''I don't like the process, but I think it's the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Cal Nichols, chairman of the Edmonton ownership group, said the Oilers would not seek compensation from any team that signed Sather. He also said the Oilers would not pursue tampering charges against other teams, after saying Thursday that they might.</p>
        <p>''We just thought it was the ethical thing to do, just drop it and let everyone get on with their lives,'' Nichols said.</p>
        <p>Sather said he did not have a job offer on the table. ''This is the first time since I was 16 years old that I've been unemployed.''</p>
        <p>Speaking about the possibility of a position with the Coyotes, Sather said, ''The last I looked, Phoenix had a general manager, they don't have new ownership and I'm not sure Wayne's going there.'' But he also said his decision would not depend on what Gretzky did.</p>
        <p>Sather said he would not have left the Oilers had Jim Hole not been succeeded by Nichols. ''I never thought I'd leave the organization,'' he said. ''I thought I'd retire here. But things change.''</p>
        <p>Nichols said that ''this didn't happen in 24 hours,'' and, noting that the Oilers' owners expected to lose $8 million this season, added, ''In part, this all boils down to money.''</p>
        <p>Before flying to Edmonton for the news conference, Sather spoke from an airport near his home in La Quinta, Calif. ''I would say that my biggest regret is that it eventually had to come to this,'' he said. ''But sometimes in life, you need a new adventure. I'm looking forward to whatever happens. I haven't decided on what I'm doing. I'm just going to take it one step at a time.''</p>
        <p>As has been the case throughout his search for a new Rangers president, coach and general manager, Checketts had no comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Friends and associates of Sather have expressed skepticism that he was leaving Edmonton for New York. Sather is more comfortable in the West.</p>
        <p>But Sather played down that factor. ''It's easier and quicker to get from New York to La Quinta than it is from Edmonton to La Quinta,'' he said Thursday night, adding that his wife is from Philadelphia. ''When I played in New York, I loved it.''</p>
        <p>Sather played left wing for the Rangers for four seasons, from 1970 to 1973. Later, as coach and general manager in Edmonton, he came to be synonymous with the Oilers, who won five Stanley Cups with him at the helm.</p>
        <p>Four of those cup triumphs came with Gretzky as the Oilers' captain. Gretzky, who retired from the Rangers a year ago, is weighing an offer from Steve Ellman, an Arizona developer, to become majority owner of the Coyotes. Ellman, however, is having difficulty meeting payments to secure his purchase of both the team and land for a new arena in Scottsdale.</p>
        <p>Those in hockey who know both Gretzky and Sather say that the race is on between the Rangers and Gretzky. ''If the Rangers do what they can do, they'll make Glen make his decision before Gretz makes his,'' said one person, who insisted on anonymity. ''The Rangers need to move quickly now.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the Rangers and Ellman were both granted permission to speak with Sather by Hole, who represents Edmonton on the National Hockey League's board of governors. Hole is a close Sather ally. Nichols, who replaced Hole as chairman of the team earlier this season, is not.</p>
        <p>Many expressed surprise that Sather decided to leave. But he grew frustrated with the constraints of running a small-market team. Edmonton's $21.2 million payroll this season ranked 22nd in the 28-team league. Yesterday, Sather cited a change in ownership, a change in the leadership of the ownership, and the inability of Canadian teams to receive financial subsidies from their national government as factors in his decision.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's been an instant, spin-of-the-moment, not-thought-out decision,'' Sather said. ''It's been around for a couple of years. I've been there for almost 25 years. I had a lot of great times and a lot of great experiences. I just think it's time to look around and take some time off.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, this had to come to an end,'' Sather said. ''But I've been thinking pretty hard about it for quite a long time.''</p>
