        <p>Laughter echoed from the other half of the Yankees' clubhouse before tonight's game. ''Look at Knoblauch,'' David Cone said, pausing in his conversation.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch was doing an impression of his teammate Jim Leyritz: a miniature Yankees jersey jammed into his waistband with the fabric stretched tautly over his torso, a No. 13 taped on his back, and he was bent forward, bat waggling. Leyritz watched, his smile cockeyed, and Knoblauch cackled gleefully.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch and the rest of the Yankees are much more relaxed now that they have resumed hitting, scoring and winning. Tonight they pounded the Indians, 11-7, for their fourth consecutive victory against Cleveland here this year and their 25th in 34 regular-season games at Jacobs Field.</p>
        <p>Paul O'Neill had a single, a double and a home run, and Bernie Williams drove in three runs for the Yankees (24-14), who have 20 runs and 29 hits in their last two games.</p>
        <p>''I'm just pleased we were able to keep coming back at them,'' Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees placed shortstop Derek Jeter on the 15-day disabled list with an abdominal strain and promoted the top prospect Alfonso Soriano to play in his place. Soriano was used at third base in April and was atrocious defensively, clearly uncomfortable playing a position besides shortstop. Even while playing his natural position tonight, however, Soriano fumbled a couple of balls anxiously before making plays and committing a throwing error that led to three unearned runs.</p>
        <p>Soriano flew here from Rochester and did not share in the Yankees' harrowing flight Thursday night. Bad weather kept their flight on the ground in Newark for about three hours. And after finally taking off and approaching the Cleveland area, the players said, the plane circled repeatedly through lightning. ''I knew it was bad when I saw the flight attendant start to panic,'' said Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher.</p>
        <p>They landed with all but their psyches unscathed; this certainly ranked among his worst flights ever, Posada said. And the weather continued to haunt. The pitchers could not control the baseball. Knoblauch drew a walk leading off the game, the first of 15 issued by the teams.</p>
        <p>The walks led to many rallies and runs and an incredibly long and slow game -- the first five innings lasted  2 hours 23 minutes -- and Knoblauch was often in the middle of what the Yankees' hitters accomplished.</p>
        <p>''Knobby had some big at-bats, a couple of base hits,'' Torre said. ''He's looked as comfortable as he has all year.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees trailed, 2-1, in the top of the fifth inning, and after Shane Spencer and Ricky Ledee reached second and third with nobody out, Cleveland's Dave Burba struck out Scott Brosius and retired Soriano on a grounder. Knoblauch fell behind, no balls and two strikes, and the rally appeared finished.</p>
        <p>But Knoblauch worked his way back against Burba, taking a ball, fouling off a pitch, taking two more balls, fouling off three more pitches, and on the 10th pitch of the at-bat, Burba walked Knoblauch.</p>
        <p>If Burba was exhausted, there was good reason -- by the end of Knoblauch's at-bat, he had thrown 76 pitches in less than four innings. Only a few knockout blows were needed to finish him.</p>
        <p>''That was really big, and it didn't surprise me,'' Torre said of Knoblauch's lengthy at-bat. ''When he's fouling balls over our dugout, you know he's waiting on the ball well.''</p>
        <p>Williams, batting in the No. 2 slot again, followed Knoblauch's walk with a three-run double. O'Neill doubled home Williams and scored when Tino Martinez singled. Posada singled, finishing Burba; the Yankees led, 6-2.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees had more work to do. Wiping his nose with his sleeve time and again, Andy Pettitte was miserable, and he allowed four runs in the fourth, the last three on Manny Ramirez's homer. Knoblauch singled home the go-ahead run against Scott Kamieniecki in the fifth, however, and two batters later, O'Neill clubbed a two-run homer. Ledee blistered a two-run homer in the sixth, increasing the Yankees' lead to 11-7.</p>
        <p>Ramiro Mendoza, who relieved Pettitte in the fifth and pitched two and two-thirds innings, improved his record to 4-2.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Indians' front office rushed to make trade inquiries Friday, after a devastating series of injuries to their pitching staff. CHARLES NAGY had elbow surgery for removal of bone chips and will miss six to eight weeks, and the Indians will not know for months if he will regain his effectiveness this year. RICARDO RINCON, the late-inning left-hander used to combat the likes of PAUL O'NEILL, was also placed on the disabled list and may require surgery; in any event, the Indians do not think he will be back until August, at the earliest. And JARET WRIGHT was placed on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder trouble. . . . DEREK JETER, placed on the 15-day disabled list, will continue his rehabilitation in Tampa, Fla. Jeter will not be eligible to be activated until May 27, when the Yankees will be in the middle of a three-game series against the Boston Red Sox. . . . ALLEN WATSON is to pitch twice more for Class AAA Columbus and if all goes well, he will be activated in time for the Yankees' series in Chicago on Tuesday. . . . Outfielder FELIX JOSE, on the 15-day disabled list with a strained groin, began an injury rehabilitation assignment with Class AAA Columbus.</p>
