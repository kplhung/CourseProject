        <p>Anyone up for 264 hours of convention coverage a day?</p>
        <p>The number may sound highly improbable, given that a political convention only lasts for four days. (Or 96 hours, if no one sleeps.) But 264 hours is the amount of daily exposure that one television network, CNN, has told Republican officials that it will supply for their presidential nominating convention in Philadelphia starting in late July.</p>
        <p>CNN's estimate -- made viable by the cable network's growing array of 24-hour news outlets, ranging from CNN International to CNN En Espanol to CNNfn, all of which will simultaneously carry convention programming -- was disclosed to the Republican National Convention as part of CNN's pitch for space in the hall of the First Union Center in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Representatives of other television networks, both cable and over-the-air, snicker at the grandiosity of CNN's saturation claims. ''Over here, there are still only 24 hours in the day,'' said a publicity agent for a competing outlet. But CNN officials, who are aggressively seeking the title of ''network of record'' for the 2000 campaign, say there are few events in a democratic society of greater importance.</p>
        <p>''How could it be overkill when we're talking about the fate of this country and who we're electing?'' asked Gail Evans, a CNN executive vice president. ''People love the drama of politics, and this is the moment when the campaign becomes real.''</p>
        <p>The breadth of the network's plan is a reflection of the rapidly changing nature of convention coverage. As the traditional over-the-air networks scale back their coverage, with some promising only an hour of prime-time convention news each night, cable networks and Web sites are stepping into the void with wall-to-wall plans. As a result, the physical presence of the news operations at the convention is changing, too.</p>
        <p>Tim Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the Republican convention, to be held July 31-Aug. 3, said that political Internet sites, a marginal presence at the 1996 convention in San Diego, will be represented in vastly greater numbers this year: 55 booths have been set aside for Web sites in a building adjacent to the First Union Center.</p>
        <p>And the allotment of skybooths reflects a changing pecking order: CNN and NBC (in combination with its cable sibling, MSNBC) will each be allocated five skybooths, Mr. Fitzpatrick said; CBS and Fox get four each and ABC two, though that network will also create a virtual skybooth inside the hall and have its anchor, Peter Jennings, positioned at various places in the center.</p>
        <p>''It's a whole new ballgame this year,'' said Steve Scully, political editor of C-Span, which will offer gavel-to-gavel convention coverage and even broadcast from the parties' platform hearings this summer. ''It's the clear pattern of cable taking over what was once the domain of ABC, NBC and CBS.''</p>
        <p>Officials at the old-line networks say the evolution of the conventions into veritable four-day-long commercials, with little major breaking news to offer besides the selection of a vice-presidential candidate, justifies the reduced coverage in commercial prime time.</p>
        <p>''And even if the number of hours are fewer, our reporting and analysis are every bit as strong as they've ever been,'' said Marc Burstein, executive producer of special events for ABC News. ''And in fact, more people will watch ABC in the somewhat limited hours ABC is providing than will see convention news elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>Because viewership remains so much higher on the commercial networks, it is not clear whether the blanket coverage on the cable networks will make up the difference in the size of the viewing audience.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if there's any way to add up the audiences of cable and C-Span and us, and whether that measures up to what the commercial presence once was,'' said Lester M. Crystal, executive producer of ''The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.'' The program is producing PBS's gavel-to-gavel convention coverage.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Crystal added that there had been no talk at PBS about reducing the network's commitment. ''We think there is an important story to evaluate here, how these parties try and represent what the country wants, what the country needs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nearly 16,000 journalists are expected to cover the Republican convention, Mr. Fitzpatrick said. (The Democrats meet Aug. 14-17 in Los Angeles.)</p>
        <p>CNN alone will have about 500 staff members in Philadelphia, said Jane Maxwell, CNN's senior vice president for special events. The network's personnel will feed programming to CNN's various networks, which now total 14. These include an airport network, a service to 800 affiliated stations around the world and video streaming to a dozen Web sites.</p>
        <p>''Given the conglomeration of services under the CNN umbrella, there is the opportunity to do convention programming that many hours a day,'' Ms. Maxwell said, referring to the proposed 264 hours.</p>
        <p>It is a long way from the network's presence at its first convention, the 1980 Democratic gathering in New York City, where it had a single booth high in the hall above those of the other networks. ''It wasn't even glassed in,'' Ms. Maxwell said. ''So every time the band struck up, the anchors couldn't talk.''</p>
