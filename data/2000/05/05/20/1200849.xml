        <p>A fire captain who died of smoke inhalation last spring after searching a burning Queens home for a probationary firefighter disregarded a warning that his air tank was nearly empty and then collapsed from lack of oxygen, according to a Fire Department inquiry released yesterday.</p>
        <p>As an alarm on his air tank sounded, the captain, Vincent Fowler, began yelling, ''Where is my probie?'' losing precious seconds that he could have used to escape from the burning house at 150-28 127th Street in South Ozone Park on June 3, according to the report by the department's safety unit. Captain Fowler, 45, was rescued, but he died from smoke inhalation 14 hours later at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center.</p>
        <p>The report detailed a number of missteps that hindered the rescue, including illegal renovations in the home that created narrow passageways and a ''lack of operational discipline'' by firefighters who crowded into the cramped cellar and stairwell in an effort to save their colleague.</p>
        <p>Captain Fowler, a 21-year veteran working with Ladder Company 173,  arrived at the fire wearing a standard 30-minute air tank. Fire officials said firefighters working to extinguish a fire can use up the air in 17 minutes. An alarm sounds when the tank has about six minutes of oxygen left, and department procedure calls for a firefighter to leave the fire at that point. But Captain Fowler's alarm sounded only six minutes after he entered the fire, and the tank emptied in two minutes. The report said Captain Fowler failed to follow procedures ''by not exiting the fire area'' when the alarm sounded.</p>
        <p>Capt. Peter Gorman, the Uniformed Fire Officers Association president, said: ''I take exception to the idea that they are blaming the victim and he can't defend himself. Captain Fowler disregarded his own life to find'' the probationary firefighter.</p>
        <p>Deputy Fire Commissioner Michael Regan responded: ''We, too,  consider Captain Fowler a hero. Safety reports have long served as a learning tool, and that's all that this is.''</p>
        <p>The lesson to be learned from the fire, Captain Gorman said, is that the so-called 30-minute tank is a misnomer. ''The department has to update the estimates it gives on how long they can last,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Since the fire, officials said, the Fire Department has created new procedures and training materials intended to clarify the best procedures on how to make rescues.</p>
        <p>Officials said the investigators had found nothing wrong with Captain Fowler's tank. But they said a large man in a stressful situation who is exerting a lot of energy will empty his tank in a far shorter time than usual. Captain Fowler was 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighed more than 260 pounds.</p>
        <p>One recommendation in the 22-page report is that the city should consider issuing 45-minute tanks to firefighters who do not already have them. Officials said that although the idea is being considered, some experts have questioned whether extra oxygen would lead firefighters to take more risks. ''Some of the doctors have concerns that this would mean that people would begin to go further and further in because of their confidence in the pack,'' said Fire Chief Brian Dixon.</p>
        <p>According to the report, when Captain Fowler ran out of oxygen, he began coughing and said: ''I'm out of air. I need air.'' The probationary firefighter whom Captain Fowler had been looking for then rushed up and began sharing his own oxygen, but the captain soon collapsed and lost consciousness.</p>
        <p>The report said the firefighters who rushed to rescue Captain Fowler found it very difficult to maneuver in the dark and cramped conditions, where the primary access to the cluttered cellar was a narrow staircase and one doorway was only 24 inches wide. As a result, it took the rescuers 19 minutes to get Captain Fowler out of the building.</p>
        <p>Fire marshals have said the fire was caused by faulty wiring.</p>
