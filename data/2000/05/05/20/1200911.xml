        <p>The instant the serene Allan Houston calmly put down two free throws with 17.6 seconds left on the clock, there was an explosion of noise from the amazed witnesses to an improbable comeback.</p>
        <p>The Knicks were down by 18 points in the second quarter to the determined Miami Heat and on the verge of having their season ended by their loathed rivals when Houston acted as a faith healer. He completed the revival of the Knicks when his smooth touch gave his team a lead for the first time since the opening five minutes of Game 6.</p>
        <p>That's all the Knicks would need as they evened the four-of-seven-game second-round series with a 72-70 victory that was preserved the moment Anthony Carter's 3-pointer bounced wildly off the rim.</p>
        <p>It was devastating for the Heat, which has just one day to recover from the pain of this loss. A deciding Game 7 will be played in Miami tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. For the third straight year, the Knicks will have the opportunity to eliminate Coach Pat Riley's team on his home floor.</p>
        <p>It was a chance the Knicks nearly missed. Down by 15 points at halftime, the Knicks leaned on their pride and edge in talent to painstakingly overcome the Heat's gaudy lead. In a surreal turn of events, a Knicks team that specializes in turning adversity into adrenaline was at its dramatic best.</p>
        <p>''This was a great, great comeback,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''The only thing that makes it really memorable is if it leads to a series win. I told them at the half -- and we didn't speak for very long -- that there were no adjustments to make. There was no nothing. We picked the most inopportune time to play the worst half we played all year.</p>
        <p>''But I told them that they were going to be part of the best comeback in their playoff lives. And if they didn't believe it, they were to stay in the locker room.''</p>
        <p>Each of the Knicks came out inspired. Houston was determined to separate himself from Dan Majerle while Latrell Sprewell was dead set on shooting until his shot dropped. Together, they sent the Knicks on a 13-2 run to get back into the game in the first four minutes of the third quarter.</p>
        <p>From there, the Knicks couldn't get past the stubborn Heat until Houston, who led them with 21 points, gave them the lead with 17.6 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>Houston put the Knicks back on top, but it was really Patrick Ewing who was at the heart of the final fourth-quarter push. He shook off a terrible 4-for-14 shooting effort and summoned some life out of his 37-year-old body. In the final 3:21, Ewing hit a jumper, soared in for a slam dunk off a miss by Sprewell, and then slipped in front of a Bruce Bowen pass headed for Alonzo Mourning for a steal with 30.6 seconds left. Ewing did the dirty work, then Houston finished it off with his beautiful touch.</p>
        <p>''I thought my teammates did a fantastic job,'' said Ewing, who finished with 15 points and 18 rebounds. ''We showed a lot of heart, a lot of courage. We could have easily given up.''</p>
        <p>They pressed on. Slowly, the Heat unraveled beneath the Knicks' intensified effort. Mourning was especially vulnerable to mental lapses. Failing to box out Ewing, shooting 1 for 5 in the fourth quarter, making just 2 of 4 free throws, Mourning came undone when he had a chance to crush his mentor, Ewing. As a group, the Heat shot 5 for 15 in the fourth quarter, turned the ball over twice and were outrebounded, 20-14.</p>
        <p>''It was absolute madness,'' Riley said. ''We had opportunities, and we did not take advantage of them. They made a great push. We missed, turned it over, and didn't rebound and fouled. And that was the game. Any questions?''</p>
        <p>There were lots of them for the Knicks at halftime.</p>
        <p>On the eve of Game 6, Houston admitted that he had detected a missing ingredient in his team so far in their playoff run: hunger. After last year's finals path carved against the odds by the Knicks, this team has been in constant search of something to prove this season, something to prod its pride.</p>
        <p>''I think you constantly have to prove yourself in this league,'' Van Gundy said before the game. ''I don't care if it's a player, a coach or management. If it's true that we don't think we have anything to prove -- and I don't believe that's the case -- then it's a critical mistake.''</p>
        <p>The sense of urgency that should have motivated the Knicks was not horribly apparent as the more aggressive and far crisper Heat surged to a shocking 43-25 lead with two minutes left in the second quarter. During one stretch, the Knicks were 2 for 14 under the pressure the Heat applied on defense.</p>
        <p>To make it worse, there were plays like this: On a missed jumper by Carter, the bulky Clarence Weatherspoon leaped above three Knicks and retrieved the rebound. Then he was fouled.</p>
        <p>The boos quickly came down in buckets. When the Knicks actually closed the score to 45-30 at the half, they received a handful of sarcastic cheers. As the Knicks exited at halftime, they were shooting 27.5 percent and had turned the ball over nine times. The Heat, led by Mourning's 13 points, were only hitting 34.3 percent but had just three turnovers. They also were rewarded for their assertiveness with 21 free-throw attempts. The Knicks had just seven.</p>
        <p>At this moment, Chris Childs's pregame guarantee seemed both ridiculous and another sign of the arrogance that has made the Knicks' seem dangerously overconfident.</p>
        <p>''I guarantee a win,'' Childs boasted in the locker room just an hour before tip-off. ''Y'all go out and book your flight to Miami.''</p>
        <p>The Heat made no such grandiose statements. They just came out and played hard with as few mistakes as possible. Tim Hardaway and then Carter broke down the Knicks' guards by dribbling into the paint, sucking a slow-reacting defense inside and then hitting the open man for uncontested jumpers. Mourning bulled his way into paint against Ewing and either scored or took a trip to the free-throw line.</p>
        <p>Each time the Knicks turned the ball over, the Heat ran out on the break and finished strong. The Knicks just kept backing down.</p>
        <p>And for once, rebounding was not an issue. It was the Knicks' panicked execution in the face of the Heat's defense. A harried Houston (3 for 9) continued to be invisible, while Sprewell (2 for 6) rushed his shots. Once again, the bench play of Camby and Kurt Thomas was less than spectacular. The two combined for 2 points and 5 rebounds.</p>
        <p>With so much going wrong, Van Gundy needed a halftime speech to resurrect his team's hopes. They weren't out of it. Not yet.</p>
        <p>''That was the most amazing thing I've ever been a part of,'' Sprewell said. ''We didn't give up. We weren't coming out of that locker room at halftime to give up.''</p>
