        <p>THERE was a time  say, two weeks ago -- when John C. Browne regarded the expression ''trial by fire'' as an apt metaphor for what he had endured as the director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, the government's leading nuclear weapons research center. From the day he stepped into the job a turbulent two and a half years ago, he had faced an extraordinary series of crises, from steep budget cuts, layoffs and an epidemic of safety problems to plummeting morale because of accusations that China had stolen weapons secrets from the laboratory.</p>
        <p>But he never imagined that the trial by fire would be a literal one that would nearly engulf the laboratory and leave him with a sobering sense of vulnerability to forces so completely beyond his control.</p>
        <p>Dr. Browne is just emerging from operating at the center of the worst wildfire in New Mexico's history and an unprecedented two-week shutdown of the laboratory. The 11,000 or so employees of the laboratory were kept away, the 18,000 residents of the town of Los Alamos and nearby White Rock were evacuated, and at one point the fierce fires raged to within yards of where tons of nuclear waste are stored in steel barrels under tentlike plastic structures. Many of more than 400 homes destroyed by the flames belonged to his employees.</p>
        <p>''If you have a policy dispute or something, you can reason with someone and work things out, but you don't reason with nature, certainly not over the past two weeks,'' the 57-year-old  Dr. Browne said, sitting in the laboratory's bustling emergency operations center in jeans and a windbreaker. ''It's hard to know how you prepare for something like this.''</p>
        <p>In a way, Dr. Browne, a strikingly gentle-mannered, self-effacing research physicist, was as well prepared for the wildfire as anyone could have been, because of the problems he had already weathered. Well before the fire vividly demonstrated how volatile the laboratory's rustic setting in the high desert could be, he was being forced to contend with profound changes at this cold-war holdover.</p>
        <p>Dr. Browne, a native of Pottstown, Pa., became director in November 1997, not long after deep budget cuts had caused the laboratory to lose about 900 members of its staff to buyouts and some 200 others to layoffs. He spent his first nine months in the job dealing with lawsuits filed by many of those who had lost their jobs, work that was a far cry from the pure science and research that had made him so happy in his two decades at Los Alamos, that had made the place seem like an elite university rather than a center devoted to creating weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>Then came the accidents: a guard was shot during a training exercise; a worker was nearly killed after running a jackhammer into an underground power line; some chemicals exploded.</p>
        <p>And then Congress sharply reduced the money that the laboratory could spend on pure research, which many scientists, particularly younger recruits, regard almost as a reward for good work.</p>
        <p>Perhaps worst of all, Dr. Browne said, was the dismissal and then arrest last year of Wen Ho Lee, a top scientist who was suspected of spying for China and was then indicted on charges of compromising American nuclear secrets by downloading a huge arsenal of data. Dr. Lee's indictment was followed by a ban on foreign scientists' visits to the laboratory, another enjoyable research perk.</p>
        <p>''That was probably worse than anything else as to morale,'' Dr. Browne said. ''That created a sense that the people at the lab could not be trusted. People here felt they were being punished. I would say we're still rebuilding after that.''</p>
        <p>LIKE some of those other issues, the wildfire here at first seemed controllable, then suddenly transformed itself into a threat that had people reeling. The fire was started by the National Park Service on May 4 in what was intended to be a controlled burn to thin dense pine forests nearby. But strong winds sent it leaping across canyons, and by May 7 it was closing in on the laboratory.</p>
        <p>Dr. Browne first got a call in the afternoon saying there was an approaching fire. By early evening, the winds had sent the blaze roaring to the lip of a canyon at the edge of the laboratory.</p>
        <p>''That's when I said, 'It's going to do what it's going to do,' '' he recalled, adding that heroic work by firefighters had turned the flames back.</p>
        <p>Eventually, though, the fire did sweep through several thousand acres of the laboratory's 43 square miles, destroying a handful of historic buildings from the 1940's where parts of the first atomic bomb were assembled.</p>
        <p>Dr. Browne now speaks with a sense of profound relief that finally the threat of fire is gone and the focus is on relief work and finding housing for people who lost their homes. He looks forward to being able to return to jogging, mountain biking, playing tennis and tending to his family. He and his second wife have a 13-year-old daughter, a ski racer. He has two grown children from his previous marriage.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Browne concedes that  even after the damage from the fire is repaired, the laboratory will never be the same. In a conversation just steps from a burned-out canyon, he recalled his early days working on nuclear weapons, saying that even as the Vietnam War raged, he had enjoyed the immense pleasures of a collegial, cerebral environment where physicists could unlock the secrets of the atom, like translators gently coaxing meaning from obscure texts.</p>
        <p>''That environment is so important,'' he said, ''the freedom to do that kind of science, it would be a shame to lose it.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Browne admitted that this old model was threatened by cuts in the pure-research budget and by a new mission for Los Alamos: to produce an actual component used in bombs, rather than just designs. The laboratory is already gearing up, he said, to produce ''pits,'' devices that act as a kind of nuclear trigger. He described the task as hugely important but essentially an engineering function, a significant shift from the laboratory's longtime emphasis on pure science.</p>
        <p>Such is the challenge that Dr. Browne seems destined to face repeatedly as director of the laboratory: Is it a place committed to the notion of destroying or creating?</p>
        <p>Dr. Browne was offered his initial job in a nuclear laboratory, at Lawrence Livermore in California, after receiving his doctorate from Duke University. But first the legendary physicist Edward Teller put the issue to him.</p>
        <p>''I think we will give you a job, but first I have to ask you a question,'' Dr. Browne recalled being told by Dr. Teller. ''If while you were doing your scientific research I called and said I absolutely need you to tell me the answer to this question relating to weapons, would you work on such a problem?''</p>
        <p>''I remember,'' Dr. Browne said, ''that I started giving him sort of a circuitous answer, and he interrupted me and said, 'No, this is a simple question, yes or no.' ''</p>
        <p>''I said yes,'' Dr. Browne recalled.</p>
        <p>But his manner suggested that he would not mind having it both ways.</p>
