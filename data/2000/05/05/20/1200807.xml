        <p>A week that began in violence ended violently here, with bloody clashes in the West Bank and Gaza and intensified fighting in southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>On the one-year anniversary of his election by a sweeping majority, Prime Minister Ehud Barak was trying to put out fires on many fronts at once.</p>
        <p>Because of trouble in the north, the south and within his political coalition, he was weighing a cancellation of his scheduled departure this weekend to the United States to confer with President Clinton and meet with Jewish American leaders.</p>
        <p>Despite the violence, back-channel peace talks continued in Sweden.</p>
        <p>Israeli, Palestinian and American officials have characterized them as a serious and constructive dialogue on the process itself and on the final status issues.</p>
        <p>News accounts here say that Israel is offering as much as 90 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians, although it is difficult to assess what is really happening by the bargaining moves that are leaked.</p>
        <p>Near a heavily fortified Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip, an Israeli soldier and a Palestinian policeman were wounded as Palestinian protests for the release of 1,650 prisoners degenerated into confrontations. Israeli military officials say they are investigating the source of fire that wounded the soldier, but that there was no gunbattle between troops like the one that took place on Monday near Ramallah in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''The prime minister views the events severely and has ordered the Israeli Defense Forces to act accordingly to restore calm,'' Mr. Barak's office said in a statement tonight.</p>
        <p>The protests today, which began as the Friday prayer services ended, were organized before Monday's demonstrations erupted into severe rioting that ended with three Palestinians dead. Palestinian authorities said they were trying to keep tensions low, although in Ramallah their effort did not appear to be of sustained high intensity. Many officers stepped to the side as a march, organized by the militant Islamic group Hamas, headed toward confrontation with the Israeli forces.</p>
        <p>In Qalqilya, in contrast, Palestinian police officers held back demonstrators with nightsticks. At least 20 Palestinians were injured by rubber-coated bullets. Another  ''day of rage'' was scheduled for Saturday.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether the violence would delay the transfer of Abu Dis and two other villages near Jerusalem to the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Barak's advisers said he would turn over the towns within days, provided that Palestinian officials calmed the streets and cooperated with their investigation of how things got out of hand on Monday.</p>
        <p>In the north, Israeli warplanes attacked suspected guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon today. This followed fighting Thursday, the heaviest in two weeks, in which 14 people were wounded, including 4 Lebanese civilians and a United Nations peacekeeper.</p>
