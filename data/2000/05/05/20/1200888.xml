        <p>Portland Trail Blazers have had some success in containing Los Angeles Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal, NBA's most valuable player (M)</p>

        <p>Shaquille O'Neal slowly lowered himself into a folding chair today and quickly enlightened everybody about what not to expect in the Western Conference finals. For the record, the center with the extra-large Superman tattoo on his left arm will not fly solo against the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
        <p>''This is not a Shaq versus Sabonis thing,'' O'Neal said about his counterpart, Arvydas Sabonis.</p>
        <p>Bodies and elbows will fly and mind games will be played. After splitting four regular-season games with the mirror-image Trail Blazers, the usually fearless Los Angeles Lakers know that tactics and teamwork matter as much as talent.</p>
        <p>Whether worried about Scottie Pippen stealing signals from Lakers Coach Phil Jackson's triangle offense or concerned about the 6-foot-9-inch A. C. Green giving up 2 inches and 11 years to Rasheed Wallace, the Lakers realize many consider them the underdogs when the four-of-seven-game series begins here Saturday at the Staples Center.</p>
        <p>More than any Laker, O'Neal, the National Basketball Association's most valuable player, will need plenty of help to boost an offense that has consistently sagged against Sabonis and his backups on a deep Portland bench.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers held O'Neal to 20.5 points in those four games, well below his playoff and season averages of just under 30. Only Atlanta (16 points) and Houston (19) stopped O'Neal more effectively this season.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't taking as many shots,'' O'Neal said, trying to explain his  10-point drop against the Trail Blazers. ''I was missing the chippies. They've got a lot of big bodies that they throw at you. That makes it a lot easier to miss.''</p>
        <p>At 7-3 and 282 pounds, Sabonis could almost pass for O'Neal's body double. Wallace (6-11), Detlef Schrempf (6-10) and Jermaine O'Neal (6-11) are also capable of guarding O'Neal, giving the Trail Blazers a considerable edge in depth and more than 20 fouls to wear down the Lakers center.</p>
        <p>''They've got the size and quickness to give him problems,'' Lakers guard Ron Harper said. ''But he'll adjust. Shaq will get more points this series.''</p>
        <p>Glen Rice also found himself working harder with less success against the Trail Blazers, who shaved almost 5 points off his regular-season scoring average. Los Angeles needs Rice to score to create opportunities for O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.</p>
        <p>The Lakers need to solve another matchup puzzle between the 36-year-old Green and the 25-year-old Wallace. Jackson said he expects about 25 minutes of hard-nosed defense from Green.</p>
        <p>''He's a low-post player, and I'll just use everything I can think of to get him off his spot,'' Green said.</p>
        <p>And then there is Pippen, who played 11 years and won six championships with Jackson as his coach with the Chicago Bulls. Jackson acknowledged today that Pippen knows the Lakers' triangle sets so well that he stole the Lakers' signs in at least two games this season.</p>
        <p>Jackson sent a volley toward Pippen on Wednesday, telling reporters that the Trail Blazers' chances rested with his former Bulls star.</p>
        <p>''I think that if Scottie doesn't lead this basketball club, they're not going to get by us,'' Jackson said. ''Who else can lead them? I don't see another leader on that basketball club that can get things done in critical times and make the plays.''</p>
