        <p>The Security Council today increased the number of troops allowed in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone by 2,000 and is likely to expand the force by several thousand more in the next week or two.</p>
        <p>The Sierra Leone mission, originally limited to 11,000 troops by the council, is already the largest United Nations peacekeeping operation anywhere.</p>
        <p>But today's increase was required after reinforcements from Bangladesh, Jordan and India arrived this week. Those troops were expected to push the force above the limit set in February, just before the United Nations took over peacekeeping in Sierra Leone from a regional contingent led by Nigeria.</p>
        <p>But another increase to as many as 16,500 troops, which Secretary General Kofi Annan is expected to recommend to the council in the next few days, will represent a substantial commitment to bringing peace to Sierra Leone, even while rebels there are still holding more than 300 peacekeepers hostage.</p>
        <p>Some hostages have been freed, but with alarming delays, United Nations officials said. Releases have been promised, then have not taken place, causing the United Nations to increase the number of troops listed as missing. More than 500 soldiers and monitors, most of them African, were seized by rebels at the beginning of the month.</p>
        <p>Any increases in the size of the peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone pose a problem for American diplomats here because they are expected to give Congress, where there is considerable opposition to these operations, 15 days' notice of any new or augmented mission. The administration can waive this notification, as it apparently did for today's vote, but the procedure could seriously delay the next move in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, officials are concerned about how a weak elected government in the capital, Freetown, will deal with Foday Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, whose forces took the hostages. Mr. Sankoh is now in custody after nine days in hiding. But the fact that the government has not decided what to do with Mr. Sankoh appears to be emboldening some of his followers to demand that he be freed if the war is to be settled.</p>
        <p>The government said today that it was investigating Mr. Sankoh's case. His troops have been responsible for savage brutality in a civil war that has lasted nearly nine years. In 1997, Mr. Sankoh was sentenced to death for treason. In an agreement signed in Lome, Togo, last July, Mr. Sankoh was nevertheless given amnesty -- not recognized by the United Nations -- in return for a promise to disarm. But when his soldiers began turning in weapons to peacekeepers, rebels in the group responded by taking the hostages.</p>
        <p>Today, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's representative at the United Nations, who introduced the resolution to enlarge the peacekeeping force, said that Mr. Sankoh had violated the Lome agreement, implying that all promises made to him in the peace accord were off. Mr. Sankoh had also been promised a role in a power-sharing government.</p>
        <p>Ambassador Greenstock also warned that there could be no negotiating for the release of hostages or attempts to link the fate of the United Nations soldiers to any other issue.</p>
        <p>Britain has about 800 troops in Sierra Leone who were sent to evacuate foreigners. But now those troops are playing a major role in keeping  Freetown reasonably calm, United Nations officials say.</p>
        <p>With an increase in United Nations troop strength for Sierra Leone, Nigerian troops are likely to return to the country, along with other West African peacekeepers representing a regional organization, the Economic Community of West African States and its cease-fire monitoring group, known as Ecomog. It is still not clear whether they will be under direct United Nations command or deployed in some other way.</p>
        <p>In Monrovia, Liberia, today, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a special envoy sent to the region by President Clinton to work for the release of the hostages, said that there was no room for negotiation. ''Peacekeepers cannot be target practice for the R.U.F.,'' he said. Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, another former rebel leader with ties to Mr. Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front, has been credited with a role in the freeing of about 150 hostages before the releases stopped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson told reporters in Monrovia that during an earlier stop in Lagos, he had urged Nigeria to send more troops to Sierra Leone to help settle the political crisis. ''They have the power to remove the R.U.F. as a military consideration in negotiations,'' he said at a news conference at Monrovia's airport.</p>
