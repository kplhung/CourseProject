        <p>Today's conservative critics often condemn as undemocratic the Supreme Court's power to hold legislative actions unconstitutional. Former Judge Robert Bork has gone so far as to propose, in the name of democracy, that all Supreme Court decisions be subject to reversal by majority votes in Congress.</p>
        <p>This week's Supreme Court decision striking down part of the Violence Against Women Act as beyond Congress's power over interstate commerce puts those critics in something of an ironic bind. Most of them probably disliked the act. But the court's 5-to-4 majority overrode a signal example of the democratic process: years of hearings and mountains of evidence showing that violence against women is so pervasive in this country that it affects interstate commerce.</p>
        <p>I think it was a close case. The provision struck down by the court, allowing abused women to bring civil damage suits in federal courts, was indeed at the edge of Congressional power. On the other hand, Chief Justice Rehnquist's opinion for the majority was troubling in the way it substituted its appraisal for Congress's careful effort to show the effect on national commerce.</p>
        <p>The really troubling part of the decision is the larger context. In a series of cases in recent years the five-member majority of this court has undertaken to cut back the power of Congress vis-a-vis the states.</p>
        <p>For the first time in half a century the majority has second-guessed Congress's exercise of its commerce power. The same majority, in its most extreme decisions, has held that Congress cannot authorize damage suits against state institutions to enforce federal wage-hour and other laws.</p>
        <p>In those cases the majority seemed to believe that it was returning to a historic role of the Supreme Court in protecting the states from federal power. But a masterly recent article in the Columbia Law Review, by Prof. Larry D. Kramer of the New York University Law School, shows that view of history to be a myth.</p>
        <p>In its early days, Professor Kramer points out, the Supreme Court repeatedly upheld such expansive federal legislation as the establishment of the Bank of the United States. It took a broad view of the federal power over commerce. Before the Civil War, the court stepped in only once to protect state sovereignty. That was in the ill-fated Dred Scott case.</p>
        <p>In fact, as Professor Kramer says, ''States do most of the governing in this country.'' Their law covers most contracts, property, torts, domestic relations, crime and so on. So despite the vast growth of federal law, the states have held their own. They have done that, mostly, not because of protection by the Supreme Court but because our political traditions and institutions work in that direction.</p>
        <p>''This system may not be perfect,'' Professor Kramer concludes, ''but its costs are probably less than those likely to follow from aggressive judicial intervention in politics. . . . More than two centuries of successful federalism without the aid of an aggressive judiciary suggests that no such intercession is needed.''</p>
        <p>The practical difficulties of trying to draw judicial lines on what is ''interstate commerce'' are also great. The Supreme Court tried that early in the 20th century, for example deciding that mining was not ''commerce.'' That effort collapsed.</p>
        <p>If the violence against women case and other recent decisions are part of a judicial effort to define categories of activity that are beyond federal power, my guess is that it will not work. Our economy and society are too dynamic to be confined in such abstract terms.</p>
        <p>But it does not seem to me unwise to have the Supreme Court as an ultimate protector of federalism. Politics, for example, has not proved to be effective in keeping federal criminal law out of traditional state areas. Paranoia about drugs and crime has led to much unwise federalization of criminal law.</p>
        <p>For such reasons, Prof. Gerald Gunther of the Stanford Law School took a benign view of the violence against women decision. The court should have paid more heed, he said, to the record made by Congress. But ''it was not a catastrophe.''</p>
        <p>What would be a catastrophe is a headstrong majority pressing a dubious historic vision to a serious clash with Congress, and with reality.</p>
