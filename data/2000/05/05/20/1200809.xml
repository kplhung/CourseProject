        <p>A Federal appeals court upheld today the constitutionality of a law that sets limits on the size of a cable company. The ruling strengthens the hand of the government as it completes its review of the largest merger in the cable television industry.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals here reversed a lower court opinion that had found the law violated the First Amendment. The lower court decision had cast a cloud over the pending review by regulators of AT&amp;T's proposed merger with MediaOne, which, when completed, will catapult the company to the top of the industry.</p>
        <p>The rules by the Federal Communications Commission limit cable ownership to 30 percent of the market, and by some estimates, the combined company would control about 40 percent or more of the market.</p>
        <p>The decision written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg of the appeals court stated that in writing the law, Congress ''drew reasonable inferences, based upon substantial evidence, that increases in the concentration of cable operators threatened diversity and competition in the cable industry.''</p>
        <p>Officials at the F.C.C. said they would be completing the examination of the AT&amp;T deal shortly. The agency immediately lifted a stay it had imposed on the enforcement of its cable concentration rules. The commission is expected to approve the deal soon, although AT&amp;T has been lobbying hard to get as much time as possible to complete any divestitures. The Justice Department is also examining the deal to see if it violates any provisions of Federal antitrust law.</p>
        <p>In its decision, the appeals court also upheld the constitutionality of a law that gives regulators the authority to limit the number of channels in which a cable system can have a financial interest.</p>
