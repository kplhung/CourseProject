        <p>New York State Republicans rushed to ensure that the party could still mount a serious challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton following Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's protracted exit from the Senate contest yesterday. They rallied around the candidacy of a little-known Long Island representative as they contemplated a race whose every dynamic was altered in the space of a single afternoon.</p>
        <p>Led by Gov. George E. Pataki, party leaders in New York and Washington embraced the candidacy of Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, proclaiming him as an articulate and telegenic challenger to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Lazio declared his candidacy in an e-mail message to news organizations as soon as Mr. Giuliani announced his withdrawal, and moved to assemble a campaign staff, led by Michael Murphy, the media consultant to Senator John McCain's presidential campaign. And Mr. Pataki said in an interview that he would personally help Mr. Lazio in the formidable task of raising money for his contest with Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In a political atmosphere that veered between carnival and chaos throughout the day, there were sharply different assessments from Republicans and Democrats about how Mr. Lazio, assuming that he wins his party's support at the convention May 30, would fare in a contest against Mrs. Clinton. But it was undisputed that this second-act cast change would produce a race profoundly different from the one that would have been presented by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>What had been a battle between two celebrities -- candidates about whom almost every New Yorker had fixed and often intense opinions -- is now shaping up as a contest between a famous first lady and a congressman who is barely known outside Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>And what had been a competition between two people with fairly similar views on issues that tend to be determinative in New York, among them abortion and gun control, is now between two candidates who occupy starkly different places on the ideological spectrum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, who was never particularly happy with Mr. Giuliani in the first place, said Mr. Lazio represented a fresh, unencumbered challenger to Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Pataki praised Mr. Lazio as a four-term member of Congress whose record could appeal to moderate New Yorkers, and a candidate with an attractive television presence and a valuable base in the heart of the New York suburbs. Perhaps even more significant, Mr. Lazio is not the polarizing figure Mr. Giuliani is, robbing Mrs. Clinton of one of the advantages she enjoyed in her contest with the mayor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki -- who himself was once an unknown state senator from Peekskill, bringing what many people viewed in 1994 as a far-fetched challenge to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo -- chuckled at the notion that Mr. Lazio would be hurt by his obscurity.</p>
        <p>''He will be a very strong candidate,'' Mr. Pataki said in the interview. ''We will have a very good philosophical debate on issues, with two candidates with competing philosophies.</p>
        <p>''There are no questions in my mind that the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers will agree with Rick Lazio and not with Mrs. Clinton. Not to mention that Rick Lazio is a New Yorker. He is one of us. He doesn't have to learn what it is to be a New Yorker.''</p>
        <p>For Democrats, Mr. Lazio is an untested, barely known candidate with a conservative voting record, faced with the formidable task of financing and running a big campaign organization and making himself known to New Yorkers. And Mrs. Clinton's aides moved to define Mr. Lazio to New Yorkers before he could. They noted that he favored a ban on a form of late-term abortion and voted for much of the Contract With America as they invoked his affiliation with Newt Gingrich, the departed House speaker. Thus, they reprised a tested line of attack in New York, used in Charles E. Schumer's successful challenge to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in 1998.</p>
        <p>''Giuliani, for whatever vulnerabilities he had, did present a problem for us in terms of having a relatively good record on issues like abortion, gun control and the environment,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, in an interview. ''Now New Yorkers will have a very clear distinction. He is a genuinely conservative candidate. It's a fundamentally different race.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Rick Lazio is a clean slate that remains to be written on. Hillary Clinton has the resources to do it.''</p>
        <p>For Republicans across the state, who had waited with increasing consternation for Mr. Giuliani to act, it was a day of relief, anxiety about the future and occasional displays of irritation at the way Mr. Giuliani had handled these last few weeks. In that time, he had announced that he had prostate cancer; was involved with another woman, an Upper East Side consultant for a pharmaceutical firm; and was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has been viewed with suspicion among Republicans since he campaigned with Mr. Cuomo against Mr. Pataki in 1994. Mr. Giuliani's announcement came so late that the Republican Party had already printed thousands of ''Rudy'' placards for the convention at the end of May, a point several Republicans noted acidly yesterday. What is more, Mr. Lazio is giving up a Congressional seat that Democrats could well capture in November.</p>
        <p>Whether the mayor has any interest in running for office in the future is an open question, he said yesterday. Mr. Giuliani's aides have suggested that the mayor might want to run for governor in 2002. They acknowledged that he has as much riding on Mr. Lazio's winning this race as Mr. Lazio does himself.</p>
        <p>''A lot depends on what plays out,'' said Stephen J. Minarik, the Republican Party chairman in Monroe County, discussing Mr. Giuliani's future status. ''He is on tenuous ground with some Republicans anyway.''</p>
        <p>The mayor's advisers yesterday described Mr. Lazio's candidacy as uphill, in no small part because of his late start. ''It's going to be a very difficult campaign,'' a Giuliani adviser said. ''The Clinton campaign has had a year's head start.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton have each spent nearly a year setting up the basic instruments of a campaign. Mr. Lazio needs to set up an office, hire a staff and raise money; he has $3.5 million now, compared with $9 million for Mrs. Clinton. Presumably, Mr. Giuliani could help in that regard, since he has $9.2 million on hand that could be funneled through the Republican Party. The mayor said yesterday that he wanted to help as much as possible, but would have to study the financial and legal possibilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio lacks one of the main advantages that Mr. Giuliani brought into the race against Mrs. Clinton: the ability to draw votes in New York City. He also has a long history of votes in Congress, which Mrs. Clinton's campaign has been cataloguing for weeks now to use in speeches and advertisements that will seek to portray him as ''a foot soldier of Newt Gingrich,'' as one Mrs. Clinton's aides put it.</p>
        <p>Finally, running for Senate is entirely different from running for the House. Mrs. Clinton has spent much of the past year traveling the state, and the results of that are clearly apparent in her increasing command of New York issues and ease on the campaign trail, in contrast with her difficult start.</p>
        <p>This is Mr. Lazio's first statewide race for office, and he is not going to have the luxury of time to learn the task, several Democrats noted. And because he is the choice being offered by Mr. Pataki and the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers, he is vulnerable to portrayal by Democrats as the party machine candidate, an attack that Mr. Cuomo sought to use against Mr. Pataki, who was elected to a second term in 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also has to overcome other Republicans who are sure to float their names in the days ahead, if only to capture some attention. Representative Peter King of Long Island said yesterday that he, too, was interested in the Senate nomination, though state Republicans described his chances as remote. In addition, Joseph DioGuardi, the former Westchester representative who is seeking the Conservative Party line for Senate, also said he would seek the Republican Party's support.</p>
        <p>But for all that, Mr. Lazio clearly comes into this with several advantages, a point that many Republicans made throughout the day.</p>
        <p>''I think in many ways, this is certainly not insurmountable, and I think it presents Hillary Clinton with a whole new set of problems,'' said Representative John E. Sweeney, whose district stretches from the Hudson Valley to the Adirondacks.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Mr. Lazio is not Mr. Giuliani, and thus Mrs. Clinton can not count on the anti-Giuliani vote -- particularly among black voters -- that her own advisers had believed was critical to any victory against the mayor this November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also has a more easy-going public presence which could, several Republican leaders said yesterday, make him a stronger candidate upstate against Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Giuliani had appeared to be.</p>
        <p>''He's a very likable guy and very knowledgeable,'' said Peter Savago, the Ulster County Republican chairman. ''He will appeal to woman and working mothers. He will appeal more to the women than Rudy did.''</p>
        <p>And unlike the mayor, Mr. Lazio has a strong shot at winning the Conservative Party's endorsement, the party's chairman, Michael Long said yesterday. While Mrs. Clinton's advisers sought to portray him as conservative, Mr. Lazio's aides said that the candidate had cast enough moderate votes, on environmental protection and against some restrictions on abortion, that he would be able to counter such a line of attack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli of the Senate campaign committee said yesterday that he had grown increasingly confident about a race that he long viewed as nip-and-tuck. ''We're going to watch it, but it's no longer among the closest in the country,'' he said. ''She's in a very strong position.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps. But even Democrats acknowledged that the ingredients were now there for the kind of tale that would seem an irresistibly dramatic ending to this of all campaigns: the second-string player stepping in at the last minute and knocking out a first lady just when she and her supporters thought the race was almost won.</p>
        <p>''In my estimation, Lazio is going to be a very formidable candidate,'' said Kieran Mahoney, a Republican consultant. ''Come Labor Day, this race is going to be a a dead heat.''</p>
