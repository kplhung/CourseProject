        <p>Editorial on UN agreement with Cambodian government that could establish credible judicial process for trying Hun Sen and others responsible for Khmer Rouge atrocities</p>

        <p>Two decades after the Khmer Rouge killed more than a million Cambodians, surviving leaders of the terror may finally be prosecuted for their crimes. The United Nations recently reached an agreement with the government of Cambodia that could establish a credible judicial process for handling the cases.

        <p>Cambodia's judicial system has neither the competence nor the political independence to conduct fair trials on its own. International participation is essential. At issue has been a legitimate demand by the U.N. that the tribunal include a foreign prosecutor with sufficient independent authority to issue indictments. Under a compromise  proposed by the U.N., co-prosecutors -- one foreign and one Cambodian -- would issue indictments. Disputes between them would be resolved by a judicial panel comprising three Cambodian judges and two foreign judges. A ''super majority'' of four judges would be required to quash an indictment, meaning that the foreign judges could thwart any effort by Mr. Hun Sen to override indictments.</p>

        <p>Two decades after the Khmer Rouge killed more than a million Cambodians, surviving leaders of the terror may finally be prosecuted for their crimes. The United Nations recently reached an agreement with the government of Cambodia that could establish a credible judicial process for handling the cases. The court would be in Cambodia and require the cooperation of the Cambodian leader, Hun Sen, who had been seeking to cripple any prospect of independent justice. He has now agreed -- orally at least -- to substantial safeguards against his ability to manipulate the trials.</p>
        <p>Cambodia's judicial system has neither the competence nor the political independence to conduct fair trials on its own. International participation is essential. At issue has been a legitimate demand by the U.N. that the tribunal include a foreign prosecutor with sufficient independent authority to issue indictments. Under a compromise  proposed by the U.N., co-prosecutors -- one foreign and one Cambodian -- would issue indictments. Disputes between them would be resolved by a judicial panel comprising three Cambodian judges and two foreign judges. A ''super majority'' of four judges would be required to quash an indictment, meaning that the foreign judges could thwart any effort by Mr. Hun Sen to override indictments.</p>
        <p>The new framework should make it possible to prosecute senior Khmer Rouge officials with whom Mr. Hun Sen cut deals of immunity in exchange for political loyalty. Some issues have yet to be ironed out, including control over witness protection and extradition of suspects who might flee Cambodia. There would still be room for Mr. Hun Sen to try to manipulate the trials themselves. Cambodian judges will have a say in the outcome of the trials as well as in procedural rulings.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether Mr. Hun Sen will carry out his end of the bargain. But if he does, the trials would be conducted under the careful scrutiny of international observers as well as the Cambodian public. Breaches of due process will be duly noted and widely condemned. Any miscarriage of justice will do harm both to Cambodian survivors of the Khmer Rouge terror and to the credibility of the U.N. If it becomes clear that justice is not being done, the U.N. must be prepared to suspend its participation and walk away.</p>
