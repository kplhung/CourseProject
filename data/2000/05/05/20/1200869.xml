        <p>Following are excerpts from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's announcement yesterday at City Hall of his withdrawal from the United States Senate race, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>Thank you very, very much. I'm a very fortunate man, and this is one demonstration of why I'm a very fortunate man. God has given me a lot, and whatever obstacles that are placed in your way, I think the way to deal with it is to try to figure out how to make it, make it make you a better person. The reason I'm such a fortunate man is that I have people that love me and I love them, and they care for me and I care for them. And that's the greatest support that you can have in life. . . .</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's announcement yesterday at City Hall of his withdrawal from the United States Senate race, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>Thank you very, very much. I'm a very fortunate man, and this is one demonstration of why I'm a very fortunate man. God has given me a lot, and whatever obstacles that are placed in your way, I think the way to deal with it is to try to figure out how to make it, make it make you a better person. The reason I'm such a fortunate man is that I have people that love me and I love them, and they care for me and I care for them. And that's the greatest support that you can have in life. . . .</p>
        <p>When I was, when I was first told that I had cancer, I thought this was going to be a much easier decision. I thought all of it was going to be easier. I thought the decision about treatment would be made like I, you know, like I've made lots of other decisions in my life, some of them real tough, none like this . . . and I thought the decision about running would be sort of a calculation that you would make about how tired you would be or not be, and I've found that it's much, much more difficult than that. And I find myself unable to make, really make the treatment decision yet, even though I've been over and over it. And about the decision to run, I was almost in the same position, not being able to make it, which has never really happened to me. I've always been able to make decisions.</p>
        <p>I've also found in thinking about it, suffering over it, that something -- it's very painful and very difficult, but something very beautiful happens. It makes you figure out what you're really all about and what's really important to you and what should be important to you, you know, what, where the core of you really exists. And I guess because I've been in public life so long and politics, I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably. It isn't. . . . I've decided that what I should do is to put my health first and that I should devote the focus and attention that I should to running, to being able to figure out the best treatment, and not running for office. This is not the right time for me to run for office. If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is.</p>
        <p>I don't feel that if I take on the commitment to run, that I have the kind of confidence that I should have, that I'd be the candidate that I should be. I don't know that I'd be able to campaign the way I should. I don't know that I'd be able to concentrate on it the way that I should. And I don't know completely whether in August or September that I'd be able to continue. You know, sometimes I think yes and sometimes I think no. And it isn't right to take on that commitment if you don't feel a strong sense of certitude that you can complete it.</p>
        <p>So I called Governor Pataki and I called Bill Powers [the chairman of the New York State Republican Party] and I called Joe Bruno [the State Senate majority leader] and many other people and I told them that I would not be able to make the race and that I would do anything that I could to help them support and assist the candidate that they support and that becomes the candidate of the party. I called Rick Lazio and told him that if he's the candidate of the party, he can count on my help and my support.</p>
        <p>And the focus that I'm going to have now is going to be of fighting cancer, making a decision about my treatment. I'm not going to give daily updates about it and I'm not going to deal with it as a political matter. I'm going to deal with it clearly and completely as a personal matter. And you know, when I feel it's appropriate to announce a decision, since I'm the mayor of New York City, I certainly am going to announce it. But I'm going to ask you to give me a little space to be able to make that decision properly. . . .</p>
        <p>I thank God that it gives me another, really another 18 months to be the mayor of New York City, which I love very, very much. It's really my deep passion, the love for the people of this city and the love of this city. And I'm going to devote the time that I've been given, the extra time that I've been given, not only to do the things we have done and the things that we've accomplished together and the remarkable things that have been done, but to overcome, maybe, some of the barriers that maybe I placed there, and figure out how to overcome them. I don't know the answer to that yet, I don't know exactly how you do that. But I'm going to try very hard to do that. . . .</p>
        <p>Many people in the city have felt a big change, a great sense of optimism. They've gotten a lot of help and they've gotten a lot of benefits, and they feel very differently. But it hasn't reached everyone in this city. And there are a lot of people that haven't felt that. And I'm going to dedicate myself to trying to figure out how we can get them to feel that, too, including maybe changes I have to make in the way I approach it, the way I look at it.</p>
        <p>It doesn't mean there's going to be a new Rudy; I think that's silly. I think maybe it's going to be a different, maybe somebody who grows from the fact that you confront your limits, you confront your mortality. You realize you're not a superman and you're just a human being.</p>
        <p>And in addition to turning my attention to straightening out the health situation, I'm going to try to make sure that I'm a better mayor, that this is a better administration and that it accomplishes the goal of, you know, reaching every person that we can reach and making sure that every New Yorker feels that I'm dedicated to them, that I want to protect them, that I want to help them. And that I want my time as mayor to count for everybody. . . .</p>
        <p>I have to express a tremendous sense of gratitude and even -- and I feel like I should apologize to the people that wanted me to run, the people that, when I went in last night to the town hall meeting and I saw the people outside saying, 'Run, Rudy, run, Rudy, run, Rudy,' I had, you know, half the time last night I felt like I wanted to run. And the half the time I felt like I shouldn't do it. And when I stayed up last night -- I don't usually sleep very much, so I didn't sleep very much last night at all. And I stayed up last night going back and forth about what's the right decision and what isn't the right decision. I believe this is the right decision. And I think somehow, somewhere, some way this is all for the best. And it's going to mean that I can be a better mayor.</p>
