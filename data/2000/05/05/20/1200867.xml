        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decision to drop out of the Senate race today may or may not turn out to be good for New York Republicans. But for one top Republican, Gov. George E. Pataki, there was no such ambiguity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki much preferred Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island as the Republican candidate to oppose Hillary Rodham Clinton. He supported Mr. Giuliani a few months ago only because of a growing consensus among State Republican Party leaders that Mr. Giuliani would be Mrs. Clinton's strongest opponent.</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Pataki said he believed that Mr. Lazio would ultimately be the party's choice to run against Mrs. Clinton. He described Mr. Lazio as a worthy candidate with a politically appealing record in Congress on issues like tax cuts and smaller government.</p>
        <p>''I think he will be a very strong candidate,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''He knows the issues. He has a knowledge of policy in Washington. He has a very different philosophy than Mrs. Clinton. He believes in what has worked in this state.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki also tried to cut off speculation that he might enter the race himself, saying that he is happy to remain in his current job and support whoever becomes the Republican Party's candidate. ''I think governor is one of the great jobs, and I love New York,'' Mr. Pataki said.</p>
        <p>But many Republican officials interviewed today expressed some disappointment that Mr. Pataki has refused to jump into the race, saying that he is probably the strongest candidate the party has at this point.</p>
        <p>Kemp Hannon, a Republican State Senator from Nassau County, said he had mixed feelings about Mr. Pataki's decision to stay out of the race. On the one hand, he said, the governor would pose a daunting challenge for Mrs. Clinton, given his statewide stature. But Mr. Hannon added that the governor's absence from Albany would be a major loss for the state and the party.</p>
        <p>''He would be the strongest candidate,'' Mr. Hannon said. ''But people support his policies in Albany and want to keep him as governor.''</p>
        <p>Another Republican senator put the matter more bluntly. ''We would love the governor to run because he is by far the best candidate,'' the senator said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ''There is no question that he would be the party's first choice, possibly even before Rudy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki, the de facto head of the state party, is formidable in many respects. He is the most successful fund-raiser in state history, and has won two statewide races in a largely Democratic state. He has also kept his political operation running at a feverish pace in a nonelection year, raising $3.2 million since 1999 through three political action committees he has established.</p>
        <p>The governor has used the money to raise his profile nationally. He has hired nationally known political consultants like Benjamin L. Ginsberg, an elections specialist and Washington lawyer who serves as a campaign adviser to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and Stephen Moore, an economist with the Cato Institute in Washington.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pataki has good reason to want to stay put. If Mr. Pataki stepped down as governor, he would forfeit his annual state salary of $177,984 a year and any additional income that he earns from outside activities. He received $48,000 for three speeches he gave last year, and $50,000 for speeches he gave in 1998. He also received $24,000 for his autobiography. His salary would be considerably less in Washington, where rank-and-file members earn about $140,000 a year.</p>
        <p>As governor, Mr. Pataki also appoints hundreds of people to important positions in state government -- people who, in turn, could return the favor in a number of ways, including volunteering in the governor's campaign and raising funds for him. As senator, he would be entitled to make only a couple of dozen appointments.</p>
        <p>The governor's job also gives Mr. Pataki the status of the unchallenged boss of the state party, not to mention control over a $77 billion-a-year enterprise full of jobs and lucrative contracts that can be awarded to friends. United States senators rarely get that kind of power, either in their own party or in the day-to-day affairs of government.</p>
        <p>That said, Mr. Pataki has shown some interest in leaving Albany. Last year, for example, he gave a series of speeches around the country in an effort to bolster his national stature. Mr. Pataki was widely seen as vying for a spot on the Republicans' national ticket, possibly as a vice presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>But today, Mr. Pataki tried to dispel any notion that he was seeking a job in Washington, including a cabinet post in a new Republican administration. ''Right now, I see myself in New York,'' he said in an interview. ''If I were looking in Washington, I would have taken a harder look at the Senate race.''</p>
