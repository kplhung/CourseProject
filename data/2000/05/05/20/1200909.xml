        <p>The crowd at Madison Square Garden was surging forward last night, the sound reverberating in the ears of the Miami Heat players as the Knicks gasped their way to an improbable comeback in the final minutes. And it all looked familiar.</p>
        <p>A celebration that seemed imminent was now wilting to a most devastating loss. The Heat had talked throughout this Eastern Conference semifinal series of how the Knicks mirrored them. If they copied it in X's and O's, the Heat was also well aware that the Knicks copied it in heart and courage, too.</p>
        <p>The thoughts that Pat Riley did not want to allow his team to think -- of a return to Miami for a seventh game -- were seeping in under the din of the Garden crowd. And when Anthony Carter's final 3-point attempt as time expired bounced off the rim, giving the Knicks a 72-70 victory last night, Riley's worst, yet constant, nightmare had come to pass.</p>
        <p>The Heat and the Knicks will face off in a decisive playoff game for the fourth straight season.</p>
        <p>''It's one big death trip,'' he said of the series.</p>
        <p>His opinion of the game itself was almost as bleak: ''It's absolute madness.''</p>
        <p>The Heat now had to return to Miami with thoughts of how an 18-point lead had disappeared somewhere in the Garden noise.</p>
        <p>''Hey, man, this is what you all wanted,'' Alonzo Mourning said. ''You all wanted a Game 7 and you got it. One of the things we were working toward was trying to finish it here, and we were in great position to do it. Hey, man, for all of you who wanted a Game 7, you got what you wanted.''</p>
        <p>But in Riley's warnings, in the constant talk of avoiding a seventh game, they couldn't have imagined a scenario like this.</p>
        <p>''No, not in a playoff game, not with what's at stake,'' Tim Hardaway said. ''I never would have thought. You've got to give them credit. They came back and played hard and stayed in and fought, fought, fought. And they got the win at the end.</p>
        <p>''It was very emotional. We had them down. They wanted to come out and make one gallant effort and they did. It shouldn't even come down to this. We had the game won and we gave it to them.''</p>
        <p>Carter's last-gasp 3-point attempt came cleanly, a much better look than he had gotten with his over- or around-the-backboard shot, which won Game 3.</p>
        <p>Despite being a clear shot, this one veered to the right side of the rim from the start, leaving no debate over the outcome.</p>
        <p>''It felt real good,'' Carter said. ''I thought it was going in. I shot it a little bit too long and it hit the side of the rim. It didn't go. To tell you the truth, I don't even know what happened. The rim had a lid on it and we couldn't buy a shot.''</p>
        <p>The 18-point second-quarter lead, the 15-point advantage at the half, were a distant memory by the time the fourth quarter was winding down. The game was about survival, and the Heat tried to muster the courage that the Knicks were displaying.</p>
        <p>Mourning had 22 points in the game but was 1 for 5 in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>After the Knicks closed the gap to 64-60, it was Bruce Bowen lofting a shot that seemed bound for the ceiling, flickering over the outstretched fingertips of Marcus Camby before coming back down cleanly through the net.</p>
        <p>Then, with the lead down to 2 points, it was Carter, who had delivered the game-winner in Game 3, calmly draining a jumper to increase the lead to 68-64. When Allan Houston answered on the other end, Carter again took the shot, dropping in a jumper along the baseline with 2 minutes 21 seconds remaining. But it was only Carter and Bowen who could come up with points down the stretch. Dan Majerle, who had struck for crucial 3-point field goals earlier in the game, short-armed a runner in the lane. Mourning misfired on a jumper and when Chris Childs grabbed the rebound, the Knicks' point guard was fouled by P. J. Brown, fouling him out of the game while Childs went to the line and tied the score.</p>
        <p>''That's what it's all about, and these two teams have been at this a long time,'' Riley said. ''I didn't feel comfortable with a 15-point lead and we knew they would make some kind of a rush back at us, and they did.''</p>
        <p>Mourning added: ''I don't expect anything but a Game 7. I didn't doubt that they were going to make a run at all. I knew they were going to make a run. It was just a matter of us gathering ourselves, which we have done before, and countering their run, stopping it with force and great execution. We got sidetracked and kind of shot ourselves in the foot.''</p>
