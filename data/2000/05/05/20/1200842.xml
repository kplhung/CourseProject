        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's announcement yesterday that he is bowing out of the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton marked a decision that, once revealed, feels both correct and inevitable. But no one could have predicted as recently as a few weeks ago the degree to which the mayor who asks and gives no quarter would turn his withdrawal press conference into an existential meditation on life, love, mortality and priorities. It was, in its way, as extraordinary a political moment as the Bryant Park press conference of May 10, when Mr. Giuliani acknowledged the emotional impact of his cancer diagnosis and surprised the city, and his wife, by announcing the end of his 16-year marriage.</p>
        <p>From the medical standpoint, Mr. Giuliani was right to allow himself more time to choose between surgical and radiation therapies for his prostate cancer. From the standpoint of party loyalty, he acted unselfishly in saying he did not want to disappoint fellow Republicans by finding in September that he could not sustain a campaign. But it was the introspective, self-analytic quality of Mr. Giuliani's remarks that was most striking. The press conference was peppered with references to love, mortality, shaken confidence, an unaccustomed difficulty in making decisions. Mr. Giuliani is not the first middle-aged man to discover, under the shock of a threatening diagnosis, that ''you're not a superman and you're just a human being.''</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's announcement yesterday that he is bowing out of the Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton marked a decision that, once revealed, feels both correct and inevitable. But no one could have predicted as recently as a few weeks ago the degree to which the mayor who asks and gives no quarter would turn his withdrawal press conference into an existential meditation on life, love, mortality and priorities. It was, in its way, as extraordinary a political moment as the Bryant Park press conference of May 10, when Mr. Giuliani acknowledged the emotional impact of his cancer diagnosis and surprised the city, and his wife, by announcing the end of his 16-year marriage.</p>
        <p>From the medical standpoint, Mr. Giuliani was right to allow himself more time to choose between surgical and radiation therapies for his prostate cancer. From the standpoint of party loyalty, he acted unselfishly in saying he did not want to disappoint fellow Republicans by finding in September that he could not sustain a campaign. But it was the introspective, self-analytic quality of Mr. Giuliani's remarks that was most striking. The press conference was peppered with references to love, mortality, shaken confidence, an unaccustomed difficulty in making decisions. Mr. Giuliani is not the first middle-aged man to discover, under the shock of a threatening diagnosis, that ''you're not a superman and you're just a human being.''</p>
        <p>But he is a middle-aged man with 18 months to serve as mayor of New York City. While he dismissed talk of a ''new Rudy'' as silly, he seemed to be taking a fresh look at his relations with the city's minority communities and perhaps at the polarizing  effect of some of his statements on law enforcement. He spoke of overcoming ''barriers that maybe I placed there'' to making every New Yorker share in the city's new spirit of optimism and prosperity. The mayor even included a very un-Giuliani-like pledge to consider ''changes I have to make in the way I approach'' some issues.</p>
        <p>Cynics will say that by showing a softer side, Mr. Giuliani was looking to prepare himself for future campaigns and to limit the damage from his public romance with a single woman, Judith Nathan, and his impending legal separation from his wife, Donna Hanover. But the content of Mr. Giuliani's remarks should be taken on the merits. He has made New York City safer and more efficient. If he can spend the final months of his term healing racial tensions and behaving in a less authoritarian way, that would give real depth to his declaration of ''love for the people of this city.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's departure from the Senate race upends what seemed destined to be a battle of political titans. But Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic nominee, would make a mistake to assume that her new rival will not be competitive. For one thing, the campaign dynamic, shifting from two strong characters to one, will make Mrs. Clinton herself a central issue.</p>
        <p>At the moment, Republican leaders seem to be rallying behind Representative Rick Lazio, who will bring energy to the task. Indeed, he barely managed to muzzle his ambitions while Mr. Giuliani was the party's favored contender. With his suburban base and conservative views on social issues like abortion rights, he may win more votes upstate than Mr. Giuliani. But with the mayor out, Mrs. Clinton can aim for an even bigger vote in New York City.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, for his part, has done everyone a service by making a timely exit from a contest for which he no longer had an appetite. Even his detractors will have to concede, too, that he gave New York three weeks of political drama that no one is likely to forget.</p>
