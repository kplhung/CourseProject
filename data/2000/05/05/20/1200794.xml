        <p>The evidence after a week and a half of the Cannes Film Festival is that the usual excess, the hype, the anxiety, the strenuous star-studdedness of this annual event can coexist rather comfortably with what the French would call a serious cinematic sensibility. Serious is a serious word in this country, a word that suggests a willingness to do the hard job, to take pains, to be not just flashy but also good. So far it's been a serious festival, a festival where, contrary to custom, no big-budget Hollywood film was included in the official competition, even though the festival directors are said to have tried unsuccessfully to open this year's event with the ''Mission Impossible'' sequel starring Tom Cruise.</p>
        <p>''Every television network in Europe is here, so Tom Cruise going up the red carpet would have been great from their point of view,'' said the critic Roger Ebert, who has been coming to Cannes for 25 years. ''The biggest moments this festival has ever had were when Jimmy Stewart, Clint Eastwood and Madonna were here. I remember Eastwood especially, with everybody in their French accents shouting, 'Cleent!  Cleent!' ''</p>

        <p>The evidence after a week and a half of the Cannes Film Festival is that the usual excess, the hype, the anxiety, the strenuous star-studdedness of this annual event can coexist rather comfortably with what the French would call a serious cinematic sensibility. Serious is a serious word in this country, a word that suggests a willingness to do the hard job, to take pains, to be not just flashy but also good. So far it's been a serious festival, a festival where, contrary to custom, no big-budget Hollywood film was included in the official competition, even though the festival directors are said to have tried unsuccessfully to open this year's event with the ''Mission Impossible'' sequel starring Tom Cruise.</p>
        <p>''Every television network in Europe is here, so Tom Cruise going up the red carpet would have been great from their point of view,'' said the critic Roger Ebert, who has been coming to Cannes for 25 years. ''The biggest moments this festival has ever had were when Jimmy Stewart, Clint Eastwood and Madonna were here. I remember Eastwood especially, with everybody in their French accents shouting, 'Cleent!  Cleent!' ''</p>
        <p>So the festival has produced little in the way of surprise or shock or disgust or rebellion. But if it has not been the year of Tom Cruise, it is being proclaimed the year of Asia. And with films in the competition from Iran, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, it is indeed the year of Asia. This is serious, for it represents the real possibility of discovery.</p>
        <p>''It's a good feeling that the festival still recognizes the value of auteur cinema,'' said Edward Yang, an American-educated director from Taiwan whose film ''Yi Yi'' is one of the Asian entries in the official competition. Mr. Yang is not the only grateful person here.</p>
        <p>''We think this is a real breakthrough for Korean films,'' said Hong-Joon Kim, a member of the Korean Film Commission. He was referring to the appearance in the competition of ''Chunhyang,'' Im Kwon Taek's postcard-pretty story of official malfeasance, based on an 18th-century Korean legend. It is the first film from Korea ever to make it to such an exalted status. ''The best effect will be in Korea itself,'' Mr. Im said. ''Even in Korea, Korean films are not taken seriously. This will serve notice to our own people that Korean films may be a little bit better than they think.''</p>
        <p>All this doesn't mean that there hasn't been plenty of glitter. Cannes at this time of year has one of the world's highest concentrations of chartered yachts, beautiful people and cell phones. But the political overtones that characterize this festival have been more interesting than the garden-variety narcissistic parades.</p>
        <p>One political question has to do with the relative scarcity of American films. Even though six of them are in the competition, that is relatively low compared to the tally in other years, which raises the issue of whether this represents an expression of French cultural protectionism. The French have made no secret of their fear that European culture, which they deem to be serious, is being crushed by Hollywood.</p>
        <p>On another political front, reports have circulated that the festival's organizers rejected a formal request by the Chinese government that the Chinese entry be withdrawn, giving the festival a touch of defiance.</p>
        <p>Did the festival's directors, who decide in secret which films will be invited to compete, discriminate against American films this year? ''Yes, but it's more complicated than that,'' said one studio executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  ''The studios don't make available the films the festival wants; the festival doesn't want the films that the studios make available. The French have mixed feelings about the Americans, who bring glamour but can be too dominant. But the studios are afraid to have their films in competition, knowing that they might not win.''</p>
        <p>In any event, after a week of viewing the Asian entries, one might be inclined to agree with Mr. Yang that the festival is doing its job, recognizing work with a strong individual character. The Asian films have offered a rich and varied cinematic panorama of the sort that could be experienced only at a festival, never in the commercial arena. Among the other strong entries so far was ''Gohatto,'' or ''Taboo,'' a drama by the Japanese master Nagisa Oshima about homosexuality among samurai in late Tokugawa Japan. The film concentrates on one Sozaburo Kano, played by Ryuhei Matsuda, a boyish, coquettish recruit in a local militia who attracts the sexual attentions of several members of the force. The members of the militia and its leaders do not take an intolerant attitude toward homosexuality; indeed, they accept it as a normal tendency. Still, tragedy ensues when Kano's presence stirs up murderous jealousies and rivalries.</p>
        <p>The Chinese entry, directed by 37-year-old Jiang Wen, was a densely affecting, emotionally violent story called ''Devils on the Doorstep,'' set during the Japanese occupation of China. The Iranian film, ''Takhte Siah,'' directed by Samira Makhmalbaf, takes place in Iranian Kurdistan and depicts a group of teachers made homeless by a bombing and wandering from city to city in search of students. Probably the most cerebral of the Asian entries was Mr. Yang's ''Yi Yi,'' about three generations of modern-day Taiwanese. Mr. Yang's film suggests a kind of precariousness to ordinary life, a sense that barbarism is never far away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Im's ''Chunhyang,'' lushly scenic, full of spacious vistas and decorous ceremony, is a cinematic version of a popular Korean ballad commonly told in a musical form called Pansori, a one-man opera accompanied by a single drum. It is the story of a nobleman's son, Mongryong, who falls in love with a beautiful and cultivated girl, Chunhyang, the illegitimate daughter of a high-class courtesan and a deceased provincial governor. When she rejects the demands of a newly arrived provincial governor that she serve him as a courtesan, he tortures her and orders her to be executed during his birthday celebration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jiang's ''Devils on the Doorstep'' begins when a Chinese guerrilla fighter bursts in on a villager and orders him to watch over two Japanese prisoners until he can come back to take them away. The villagers are afraid not to follow his order, but they are also terrified of a nearby Japanese detachment that will exact terrible retribution if they discover the prisoners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jiang's work, filmed in black and white, has a grainy intensity to it and is steeped in the idioms and accents of peasant life in northern China. It captures the shrewd simplicity of people who hate the foreign occupier yet try to ingratiate themselves since the immediate cause is not to fight a patriotic war but to survive as best they can. Perhaps it is the absence of overt patriotism that led the Chinese authorities to ban it in China and to ask that it be withdrawn at Cannes.</p>
        <p>The Chinese have not officially stated their reasons. But for Mr. Jiang, the politics of his film are both confusing and paradoxically bothersome. He referred to an article in a French newspaper that raised the cynical possibility that the banning of the film was a promotional gesture, the idea being that for a Chinese film to be seen as worthy of attention internationally, it has to arouse the ire of the Chinese authorities.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to talk about this, not because I'm afraid of what might happen to me but because it seems that Chinese films all need this sort of packaging,'' Mr. Jiang said. ''To be banned makes it important. But whether a film is banned or not has nothing to do with its importance.'''</p>
        <p>''I really don't understand.'' Mr. Jiang continued. ''Because even if you go through all of the approvals, you might still not be allowed to show your film.''</p>
