        <p>Partisan vitriol dominated a House hearing on the census today, with Republicans suggesting that the Clinton administration was trying to manipulate the count to benefit Democrats, and Democrats insinuating that Republicans did not want to count members of minorities.</p>
        <p>The accusations, at a hearing of the House Government Reform Subcommittee on the Census, were not fresh. But the testy exchanges came as the Census Bureau was poised to begin the procedure that has most sharply divided the two parties: statistical sampling.</p>
        <p>''There's the pressure factor,'' said Chip Walker, communications director for the subcommittee's Republican majority. ''We're right in the middle of the census, and crucial activities are going on.''</p>
        <p>Even Kenneth Prewitt, the Census Bureau's normally reserved director, got into the fray.</p>
        <p>Last week Republicans on the subcommittee made public a memorandum from a midlevel Census Bureau manager telling subordinates that daily progress reports ''must and cannot be shared'' with investigators from the General Accounting Office. The Republicans said this indicated that there were people in ''influential'' positions at the bureau who were trying to hide what it was doing, and so were ''dangerous.''</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Prewitt angrily demanded an explanation today from the subcommittee's chairman, Representative Dan Miller of Florida. Mr. Prewitt would not relent even after the hearing had adjourned, instead confronting Mr. Walker, the communications director. ''I want to know who these influential people are and what is the evidence that they are dangerous,'' Mr. Prewitt demanded.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Walker tried to offer an explanation, Mr. Prewitt responded with an epithet.</p>
        <p>The feuding enlivened a dry, technical presentation of the current status of the census and the bureau's plans to use statistical sampling to check the accuracy of the head count and adjust the final totals.</p>
        <p>Census officials plan to collect data from a sample of 314,000 randomly selected households, and use that data to adjust population totals for geographic areas as small as a city block. The adjustment will increase the numbers of minority residents -- principally inner-city blacks and rural Hispanics, who are often missed by traditional census methods. Democrats support the plan and Republicans oppose it, primarily because both sides believe it will give Democrats an advantage during the process of redrawing Congressional districts.</p>
