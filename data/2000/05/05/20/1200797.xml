        <p>Workers in South Korea are known for their not-infrequent strikes over issues like pay and job security. But a coming showdown with the Korea Stock Exchange will be the first time they have threatened to strike over the right to have a lunch break.</p>
        <p>Thirty-thousand members of South Korea's securities industry union are planning to strike during their lunch hour beginning Monday, when the stock exchange plans to continue trading during what has historically been a midday break. The change, approved by the government, makes this country the first in Asia to keep its stock exchange open during the lunch hour.</p>
        <p>Government and exchange officials are hoping the extended hours will draw more investors to the exchange, where share prices have fallen 29 percent so far this year.</p>
        <p>But dealers at domestic brokerage firms have expressed skepticism that the move will make a difference in this or any other Asian market, where for decades, trading has been halted for an hour at midday. Dealers expressed disgust and dismay at the prospect of having to eat fast food in front of their computers instead of going out to eat.</p>
        <p>''Americans can function fine eating just hamburgers,'' said Jung Yong Geon, president of the Korea Securities Trade Union. ''But we come from a culture of eating hot bowls of hearty bean paste stew and rice. Taking away our one-hour lunch breaks is like shoving Western practices down our throats and taking away a tradition that has been passed down for thousands of years.''</p>
        <p>Many others agreed with Mr. Jung, saying the negatives of working through lunch outweigh any possible benefit.</p>
        <p>''Hamburger meals just don't go well with Korean workers,'' said Choi Won Yang, a dealer at the Shinhan Securities Company.</p>
        <p>Park Jae Han, a dealer at the Hanvit Securities Company, said, ''It's going to take much more than just an added hour of trading to turn the bearish market around, so why can't they just let us eat in peace?''</p>
        <p>There are other reasons trading through lunch may not work, securities industry workers said.</p>
        <p>One is that more than 70 percent of all investors in the South Korean bourse are individuals, and many have personal relationships with their dealers. Under the new trading hours, dealers said, they would have no time to eat, as they would be effectively chained to their desks and phones, advising clients throughout the day.</p>
        <p>''Usually, investors won't trade unless it is through a trusted broker,'' Mr. Choi at Shinhan Securities said, explaining why deploying dealers in shifts to cover the lunch hour was not a feasible option.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Korea exchange have rejected such arguments. They say it is high time that the securities industry in South Korea, where hard work is an ingrained part of the culture, apply that to buying and selling shares.</p>
        <p>''Dealers can eat Korean food delivered to their offices,'' said Kim Yu Kyung, head of securities research at the Korea Stock Exchange. ''It won't be a big problem once people get used to the new system.''</p>
        <p>He added that complications arising from working through lunch should be settled between the management and workers at individual brokerage firms, instead of creating difficulties for investors.</p>
        <p>''Korea will be a test case for other Asian nations to observe,'' said Yon Kang Keum, professor of finance at Yonsei University. ''We can no longer wait and see until other nations set precedents.''</p>
