        <p>Good goalies can have bad games, as Martin Brodeur of the Devils demonstrated in his most recent outing. The question -- and perhaps the key to the Eastern Conference finals -- is how well he responds to the next challenge.</p>
        <p>After a long team meeting replaced practice today at Continental Arena, both Brodeur and Coach Larry Robinson expressed confidence that Brodeur would improve his form when the Devils play the Philadelphia Flyers here Saturday night in Game 4.</p>
        <p>''You've got to brush it off as quick as you can,'' Brodeur said. ''There are nights you have it and there are nights you don't. It was a tough night for me. It was the first one in 13 games we've played in the playoffs so far. So it's not all bad. It's out of the way. Hopefully, I'll get through the rest of it without having another one.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur gave up at least two soft goals and seemed awkward on several saves when the Flyers won, 4-2, to take a two-games-to-one lead in the four-of-seven series. The winner of this round will meet either Dallas or Colorado for the championship. In conversations with his players lasting more than an hour, Robinson discussed more than just goaltending. ''We always have good meetings,'' Brodeur said. ''We talked about the way we should react and feel.''</p>
        <p>As Brodeur spoke in the dressing room, Robinson quietly walked up behind his goalie and whispered in his ear, causing Brodeur to smile and chuckle. Later, at a news conference, Robinson said it was wrong to blame only a goalie when a whole team played poorly, and many Devils did.</p>
        <p>''Marty is a true professional,'' Robinson said. ''It's unfair for our team to say, 'Well, we lost because Marty had a bad night.' That's not the case. We win as a team and we lose as a team. I'm sure there were a couple of goals that he would like to have back. But, there's probably, on those same goals, two or three other mistakes that were made before the goal went in. So, this is not a case where he has to feel he has to take the burden of the loss on his shoulders.''</p>
        <p>Robinson said his other players were overaggressive and lost focus on maintaining position. He said the Flyers were more disciplined at the moment, ''being in the right place, doing things with more authority and more confidence.''</p>
        <p>''Basically, they're winning all the little battles,'' he added.</p>
        <p>That may be mostly true as the Flyers have won the last two games after dropping the opener. But they have also absorbed plenty of punishment. Game 3's victim was John LeClair, who leads the team in playoff goals with 6 and in fresh stitches with 39. LeClair suffered severe facial cuts when clipped accidentally by the stick of Brodeur when the goalie cleared a puck behind the net late in the third period.</p>
        <p>LeClair said today that he planned to play Saturday, probably wearing a clear visor for protection.</p>
        <p>''The swelling has gone down drastically even from last night, so I'm really hopeful,'' LeClair said. ''I just ice it and try not to get worked up so the blood flow doesn't increase. I feel very fortunate that I didn't have any serious damage. It doesn't look too pretty.''</p>
        <p>LeClair has moved from left wing to right wing because of the absence of Daymond Langkow, a center who suffered a concussion in Game 2 when checked by Scott Stevens, the Devils defenseman. Langkow was not with the Flyers today and his status is uncertain for Game 4.</p>
        <p>Because Mark Recchi moved from right wing to center to replace Langkow, LeClair moved from left to right wing to replace Recchi. LeClair's left wing spot is being filled by Simon Gagne, a center who does not feel comfortable on the right side but is all right on the left. Gagne, a rookie, got comfortable enough Thursday night to score the final goal against Brodeur and squelch the Devils' late comeback attempt.</p>
        <p>The Flyers say Gagne and Recchi used their speed to advantage against the Devils.</p>
        <p>''Gagne and Recchi don't get hit too much because they're so quick,'' LeClair said. ''If we're coming with speed on them, they're not going to get a lot of hits on us.'' Andy Delmore, the Flyers defenseman, said Gagne and Recchi have been ''driving their defense wide.''</p>
        <p>''It's something that's been giving us the edge,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Stevens, the veteran defenseman and captain of the Devils, seemed less than impressed by these observations.</p>
        <p>''At times, they post their wings up and they throw the puck up and they chip to the middle with some speed,'' Stevens said. But he quickly added that he watched videotape from Game 3 and said, ''I didn't really see that,'' referring to the Flyers' strategy.</p>
