        <p>IN the wee hours of a new day, a large throng milled around the stands at Madison Square Garden, trying to get a peek at the hero of  Game 6, maybe even give a cheer. Patrick Ewing does not get many ovations these days. But now, in the joy of the moment, after the Knicks' 37-year-old center had so clearly been the one to keep the Knicks' season from expiring, there were all these Knicks fans who felt they had to linger and watch Ewing being interviewed on the court.</p>
        <p>Ewing sparked one of the more incredible comebacks in Knicks playoff history last night. He refused to let the Knicks truly hit bottom in the first half, when they trailed by as many as 18 points, and then he carried them to a 72-70 victory in the second. And now, for the fourth time in four years, the Knicks are headed to Miami for another deciding game against the Heat.</p>

        <p>IN the wee hours of a new day, a large throng milled around the stands at Madison Square Garden, trying to get a peek at the hero of  Game 6, maybe even give a cheer. Patrick Ewing does not get many ovations these days. But now, in the joy of the moment, after the Knicks' 37-year-old center had so clearly been the one to keep the Knicks' season from expiring, there were all these Knicks fans who felt they had to linger and watch Ewing being interviewed on the court.</p>
        <p>Ewing sparked one of the more incredible comebacks in Knicks playoff history last night. He refused to let the Knicks truly hit bottom in the first half, when they trailed by as many as 18 points, and then he carried them to a 72-70 victory in the second. And now, for the fourth time in four years, the Knicks are headed to Miami for another deciding game against the Heat.</p>
        <p>''All I can say is that I'm glad we won this game and we're playing Game 7,'' Ewing said, after he had willed the Knicks to survive. ''Anything can happen in Game 7.''</p>
        <p>There were no chants of ''Patrick! Patrick!'' as Ewing left the floor at the end of last night's game. He's been around too long, crossed too many bridges, for that type of giddy show of appreciation. There was even that bittersweet mixture of groans and cheers in the first half whenever he touched the ball. Although -- and this happens a lot with Ewing -- when the fans realized that Ewing was the only Knick who wasn't waving the white flag in the first two quarters, he drew a salute of respectful cheers and applause whenever he came out the game.</p>
        <p>In the end, Ewing played 42 minutes last night, more than any other player on either team except Latrell Sprewell. He scored 15 points, he grabbed 18 rebounds. More than any other Knick, he kept his team alive. ''Jeff really didn't say too much at halftime,'' Ewing said, looking back to a moment when the Knicks were trailing by 15. ''The guys just came together and said: 'Look, we're not ready to go on vacation. We have another half to play.' ''</p>
        <p>For Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy, halftime was one final chance to exhort his players, to underline the message he had preached to them 10 hours before as they went through a morning shoot-around.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy sat on a table after the shoot-around, talking to reporters and trying to be positive with his team one defeat from elimination. Someone asked him about the Knicks' backs being against the wall; someone else about the Knicks' sense of urgency.</p>
        <p>But Van Gundy was in no mood for cliches. ''I'm cliched out,'' he said. ''Forget desperate, urgent, us against them. We can make it a cliche thing or we can make it a rebounding thing.  What we need to do is win one home game to get to the ultimate game.''</p>
        <p>Everything between these teams has seemed to rest on the slender thread of a single shot. Allan Houston's last-second shot against the Heat last May, Tim Hardaway's last-second miracle shot against the Knicks last month, Anthony Carter's last-second miracle shot against the Knicks in Game 3's overtime. And perhaps a last-second shot tomorrow, in Game 7.</p>
        <p>What was on Van Gundy's mind yesterday morning weren't any of those shots, but the recurring problems that underlined a lack of will, not luck, on the part of the Knicks: a block-out problem on P. J. Brown, a toughness problem going after loose balls, a team rebounding problem.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy related how just an hour before he had addressed his players and turned preacher. ''We need some people to set the proper tone,'' Van Gundy said, his voice rising, as he recounted what he told his team. ''This is how you rebound to win a big game. This is how you guard to win a big game. This is how you pass to win a big game. It starts with our starting lineup. Some guys have been setting a good tone, some other guys in critical areas have not been setting the tone we need. We're either going to do it tonight, or we're going to be talking about it.''</p>
        <p>In the end, Van Gundy said, he put a pointed question to his players. He wondered who, in  their heart of hearts, really wanted a Game 7  tomorrow. ''Do you want the pressure of going back down there for another ultimate game?'' Van Gundy asked. ''If you do, it will be reflected in how we play tonight. If you sort of want to slide off into vacation, that will also be reflected in how we play.''</p>
        <p>Ewing, more than any other Knick, answered Van Gundy's question. He wanted a Game 7, and now he has it. And if Ewing has his way, Van Gundy will be exhorting his team in next week's shoot-arounds in the conference finals.</p>
