        <p>Beppie Blankert's ''Double Track'' makes disorientation a pleasure. The Dutch choreographer has devised an amazing theatrical conjuring trick. As danced by two women, it astonished American audiences in 1988 at the Pepsico Summerfare festival in Purchase, N.Y. It proved equally surprising performed by two men.</p>
        <p>Much of the action on Sunday night took place on a platform behind the audience in the downstairs space at Dance Theater Workshop. But staring straight ahead one beheld it all as a reflection in a giant mirror. Other events occurred on video screens above the mirror.</p>

        <p>Beppie Blankert's ''Double Track'' makes disorientation a pleasure. The Dutch choreographer has devised an amazing theatrical conjuring trick. As danced by two women, it astonished American audiences in 1988 at the Pepsico Summerfare festival in Purchase, N.Y. It proved equally surprising performed by two men.</p>
        <p>Much of the action on Sunday night took place on a platform behind the audience in the downstairs space at Dance Theater Workshop. But staring straight ahead one beheld it all as a reflection in a giant mirror. Other events occurred on video screens above the mirror.</p>
        <p>The setting represented a railway station platform and, both in the mirror and on one of the screens, John Taylor portrayed a fidgety man waiting for a train. He occasionally recited a text about waiting by Samuel Beckett and the recorded musical accompaniment was a chiming score by Louis Andriessen.</p>
        <p>Then in the mirror a second man, Christopher Steel, emerged magically from Mr. Taylor's body. Images of Mr. Steel also appeared waiting on a bench on the second video screen.</p>
        <p>Both seemed possessed by turbulent emotions. Mr. Steel also kept vanishing and reappearing as mysteriously as he originally arrived.</p>
        <p>The dramatic intensity may have had to do with more than the irritations of train delays. Because several confrontations were implicitly combative, it was tempting to regard Mr. Steel as representing some haunting memory Mr. Taylor's character sought to exorcise.</p>
        <p>Like Beckett's Godot, the train they awaited never arrived. Or did it? Suddenly, no one was visible in either the mirror or on the screens. The dance was over.</p>
        <p>A joint presentation of the Dance Theater Workshop Main Event and the Danspace Project Global Exchange/Out of Space series, it will be repeated tonight and tomorrow.</p>
