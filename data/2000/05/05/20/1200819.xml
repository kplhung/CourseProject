        <p>A day after withdrawing from the Peruvian presidential contest, Alejandro Toledo called for peaceful demonstrations against the government to discredit the vote scheduled for May 28.</p>
        <p>He also asked people to abstain from voting as a protest in light of allegations of fraud that have tainted the initial round of voting in April. Aides to Mr. Toledo, who has run a surprisingly strong insurgent campaign, said his call would be the beginning of a permanent civil disobedience effort he hoped would isolate and discredit the government of President Alberto K. Fujimori, who is seeking a third term.</p>
        <p>In Peru, voting is obligatory, and failure to cast a ballot carries a fine equivalent to $35 -- a large sum in this poor country -- though it has rarely been collected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo, a 54-year-old, American-educated business professor, announced his withdrawal from the May 28 election late Thursday, saying he believed that the vote would be a fraud. Today he conceded in another news conference that he has left the path open for President Fujimori to claim a new five-year term. But he also suggested that his strategy was aimed at forcing Mr. Fujimori to hold a clean election or risk becoming an international pariah.</p>
        <p>''I am going to unleash the democratic forces of Peru,'' Mr. Toledo said. ''President Fujimori can declare himself the winner, but his government will lack credibility and legitimacy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo's aides said the campaign to discredit the election and the government would include peaceful marches this weekend in Lima and in provincial capitals around the country. Protesters today set bonfires and threw stones in Chimbote, a northern port city, delaying a campaign stop by Mr. Fujimori and leaving several people injured.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori has refused to postpone the election, as Mr. Toledo demanded after the publication of a report on Thursday by the Organization of American States saying that it could not guarantee a fair and clean vote on May 28 because there was insufficient time to test a new computer program designed to count ballots. It also asked that the May 28 vote be delayed for several weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toledo said he would not get back into the race unless the election was postponed to June 18, his campaign was given equal time on all television channels and new poll-watchers were selected.</p>
        <p>The April balloting was marred by charges of vote tampering and campaign dirty tricks directed by Mr. Fujimori's intelligence agency. The report by the Organization of American States questioned why ballots and tally sheets disappeared for hours at a time after the April vote, making it impossible for its monitoring group to validate the results.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Fujimori continues to refuse to the postpone the May 28 vote, advisers to Mr. Toledo said, the opposition forces will try to follow the ''people power'' tactics that brought down the government of Ferdinand E. Marcos in the Philippines in 1986.  Those tactics included strikes by trade unions as well as business leaders, and marches by students and peasants.</p>
        <p>''We will make peaceful demonstrations, pacific resistance,'' Mr. Toledo said at the news conference, ''until there is a transparent, clean election.''</p>
        <p>A similar campaign had begun immediately following the April balloting, with thousands of university students and other protesters filling city squares across the country protesting allegations of fraud. The demonstrations stopped after three days, when the government announced that Mr. Fujimori had fallen just short of an outright majority and that a second round would be required to decide the election.</p>
        <p>Foreign election observers say privately that the internal and international pressures probably stopped the government from declaring a first-round victory for the president.</p>
        <p>The Toledo aides said they hoped the mounting protests would persuade the United States, European governments and the Organization of American States to pressure the Fujimori government to postpone the election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori has taken a hard line since Mr. Toledo dropped out. In a speech in the city of Trujillo on Thursday night, he said, ''They don't like the rules because they know they will lose the elections.''</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, Francisco Tudela, Mr. Fujimori's vice presidential running mate, said ''the door remains open'' for Mr. Toledo to take part in the election, as well as to debate Mr. Fujimori before a national television audience if the right arrangements can be negotiated. ''They are not returning our phone calls,'' Mr. Tudela said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tudela, a former foreign minister, said he did not fear threats of foreign pressure, saying ''no isolation would be viable'' because Peru and other governments in the hemisphere share strategic interests.</p>
        <p>''If international problems are created,'' Mr. Tudela said, ''it is the responsibility of the candidate who dropped out. The election process continues.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, the State Department issued a statement today that appeared to criticize Mr. Toledo as well as the government. Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said, ''We regret both the unilateral decision of the opposition candidate to withdraw from the May 28 electoral contest and the hasty ruling by the National Board of Elections rejecting a possible postponement of the date of the runoff.''</p>
