        <p>Nurses will be returning to work at Nyack Hospital, ending a five-month strike, after approving a five-year contract by a ratio of 4 to 1 yesterday.</p>
        <p>The 425 nurses are expected to return to their jobs on May 30. Under the terms of the agreement, nurses will receive 3 percent raises in July, January 2001 and January 2002.</p>
        <p>The nurses' union, the New York State Nurses Association, had said nurses were responsible for too many patients and had to work so much overtime that the quality of care suffered, which the hospital denied.</p>
        <p>The new contract will limit mandatory overtime, allowing full-time nurses to refuse extra shifts four times a year and receive bonuses for working more than four hours of overtime.</p>
        <p>The agreement also creates a committee of three nurses and three hospital managers to work out minimum staffing requirements for different parts of the hospital.</p>
        <p>On May 1, the nurses rejected an earlier proposal that would have given them 10.5 percent raises over five years and possible merit bonuses, but would have reduced the number of paid days off, including vacation and sick days, to 40 from 45. The new agreement calls for 36 paid time-off days and 12 sick days.</p>
        <p>The vote ends the third nurses' strike at the Rockland County, N.Y., hospital in the last seven years. Nurses struck for one day in 1993. In 1995, they stayed off the job for 26 days over a hospital proposal to eliminate all 12-hour shifts.</p>
        <p>Under the last contract, which expired in December 1997, nurses started at an annual salary of $42,500 and reached a top salary of $61,400 after 18 years.</p>
        <p>''I'm very proud of this union,'' said Lynn Byrnes, who has been a nurse for 41 years, the last 8 at Nyack Hospital. She voted for the agreement. ''It makes me proud to be a part of this profession.''</p>
