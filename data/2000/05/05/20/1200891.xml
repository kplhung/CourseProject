        <p>It had been 13 months since Bobby J. Jones's last victory, and holding runners was not a priority. The Mets right-hander sat out most of last season with a shoulder injury, and he went down with a calf strain after three forgettable starts this year. The game plan last night was simple: hold runners on as well as possible, but concentrate on making quality pitches.</p>
        <p>So Jones was a bit slower to home plate -- 1.5 seconds, instead of his usual 1.2, by Manager Bobby Valentine's estimation -- and the Arizona Diamondbacks easily got the first four of their club-record seven stolen bases while he was pitching last night at Shea Stadium.</p>

        <p>It had been 13 months since Bobby J. Jones's last victory, and holding runners was not a priority. The Mets right-hander sat out most of last season with a shoulder injury, and he went down with a calf strain after three forgettable starts this year. The game plan last night was simple: hold runners on as well as possible, but concentrate on making quality pitches.</p>
        <p>So Jones was a bit slower to home plate -- 1.5 seconds, instead of his usual 1.2, by Manager Bobby Valentine's estimation -- and the Arizona Diamondbacks easily got the first four of their club-record seven stolen bases while he was pitching last night at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>Even so, some of the throws from catcher Mike Piazza were far from accurate. When Tony Womack stole second after leading off the game with a single, Piazza bounced his throw off the pitcher's mound. Piazza rolled his shoulders -- he has been bothered by discomfort in his back since mid-April -- and sounded discouraged about his throwing afterward.</p>
        <p>In the end, none of it mattered. These days, games are won by homers, not steals, and Piazza's two-run shot in the fifth inning was the decisive blow in a 4-3 Mets victory. Jones worked six innings, allowing three runs on six hits and three walks.</p>
        <p>''I'm very happy right now -- very, very happy,'' Jones said. ''It's been a long time since I've pitched well, and I also got a victory out of it. I felt good out there. It's good to know I can still go out there and get the job done.''</p>
        <p>Jones had command of all four of his pitches, including the slider he worked on in two rehab starts for Class AAA Norfolk. In his first three outings, he was throwing too many fastballs, acting like a power pitcher -- ''That's not going to work for me,'' he said -- and lacking confidence in his off-speed pitches.</p>
        <p>He knew things were different in the first inning last night, when he fell behind Steve Finley, 2-0, with runners on first and second and two outs.</p>
        <p>''If I don't have the confidence or command of all of my pitches, I've got to go to the fastball there,'' Jones said. ''I threw a good changeup, he rolled over it and grounded it to first.''</p>
        <p>The inning was over, and although the Diamondbacks would score twice in the second after stealing three bases, including a double steal while pitcher Todd Stottlemyre was trying to bunt, Jones was on his way to a quality performance.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to have good games; I'm going to have games that are poor,'' said Jones, whose last victory came last April 17. ''But every time I go out there, if I can take four pitches with me and keep my team in the game, then good things are going to happen.''</p>
        <p>Piazza gave Jones the lead with the homer, which he sent down the left-field line -- the only place a ball could have gotten out on a night where the wind was blowing straight in, he said.</p>
        <p>He protected the lead in the seventh, when Womack tried to score on a double by Jay Bell off Turk Wendell. Jon Nunnally threw to Rey Ordonez, whose relay bounced several feet up the line. Piazza pounced on it, recovered and swiped the tag on Womack, ending the inning.</p>
        <p>''Mike made one of the best plays I've ever seen,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Piazza is working with a new catching coach, John Stearns, but he has still had trouble throwing out runners. Coming into last night's game, Piazza had thrown out only 4 of 32 runners trying to steal. (Mets pitchers also have three pickoffs, which count as caught stealing.) Only Houston's Mitch Meluskey (2 of 23, for 8.7 percent) had a worse percentage among National League catchers than Piazza's 12.5.</p>
        <p>Piazza takes pride in his defense, and he admitted he was ''throwing the ball pretty poorly'' last night, saying he was rushing.</p>
        <p>''I have to just try to stay composed and not feel I can make up for a good jump,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Diamondbacks' final two stolen bases came in the ninth inning, when Armando Benitez recorded his 10th save. Benitez, whose velocity has fluctuated greatly at times this season, was throwing hard, and keeping his pitches below the belt. His last pitch was a backdoor slider to Womack, who struck out with Lenny Harris on third to end the game.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>After Thursday's rainout, the Mets decided to move each of their starting pitchers back one day, which set up a MIKE HAMPTON-RANDY JOHNSON matchup tomorrow. Yesterday, the Mets decided to keep Hampton and RICK REED on their normal rest, and Hampton will start today with Reed going tomorrow. GLENDON RUSCH, who was scheduled to start today, won't start until Monday at San Diego. . . . Mets outfielder DEREK BELL said he has not batted against Johnson since he was a rookie for Toronto in 1991. Bell does not have fond memories. ''Eight of my first 17 at-bats were off Randy Johnson,'' Bell said, shaking his head. ''They told me I wasn't ready yet and sent me down.''</p>
