        <p>Alison Comito snaked along the ridge of the crease in short jagged bursts, as though she were using the Loyola defenders for footholds, scaling the arc of their craggy defense. Then she found her balance.</p>
        <p>Slamming a goal into the back of the net to end the first half and give Maryland a 9-3 lead, Comito helped power Maryland (20-1) to a 17-7 victory over Loyola in the semifinals of the National Collegiate Athletic Association lacrosse championships.</p>
        <p>In doing so, she helped the Terrapins (20-1), a five-time defending national champion, sweep away doubts that surfaced after their shaky 7-6 overtime escape from Georgetown in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>Comito's goal was the sixth straight by the Terrapins, who stumbled out to a 3-3 tie with 16 minutes 24 seconds left in the first half. But starting the second half, they scored six out of the next seven goals, providing them with a 15-4 lead over the Greyhounds (16-5) with 17:33 left in the game.</p>
        <p>''I think we have more of a connection and more of a focus,'' said Jen Adams, the Maryland attack, who is country's leading scorer. ''It was always like we're beside each other and not standing alone out there.''</p>
        <p>Adams, averaging 5.95 goals a game, scored five tonight. Comito scored four.</p>
        <p>In the second game, No. 2 Princeton (15-3) darted easily past No. 3 James Madison, 15-9, with crisp passing and canny plays, setting up Sunday's national championship matchup. Maryland defeated Princeton earlier in the year, 14-6.</p>
        <p>Although Princeton led for the entire game, the Dukes (13-5) made a last-minute push, struggling to overcome calls that disallowed three of their goals. With 10 minutes left in the game, the senior attack Julie Martinez scooped in pass from behind the goal from attack Meg McNamara. Martinez whipped the ball into the upper-left-hand corner of the net for the first of her two goals.</p>
        <p>But after an inadvertent call by the referees, the Tigers streaked downfield and dished off to the sophomore attack Kim Smith, who was waiting in the far corner of the field. Driving the baseline, the Tigers' leading scorer sliced through a steady stream of defenders, wriggling toward the goal before firing a shot past the lunge of James Madison goalie Jennifer Corrandini. Smith scored five goals in all.</p>
        <p>James Madison could not recover.</p>
        <p>The sophomore attack Lauren Simone capped a satisfying night for the Tigers, scoring her second goal with 16 seconds left in the game. As the seconds spun out, her teammates scrambled onto the field and collapsed into a huddle. They lay there, not moving, for more than a minute, basking in the moment of reaching the championship game.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the Terrapins have done this before. Maryland constantly pushed for fast breaks downfield, streaking ahead to receive long, loping passes and swooping in for hard, lined shots at Tricia Dabrowski, the Greyhound goalie.</p>
        <p>The Greyhounds were more cautious on offense, careful with their rare opportunities in controlling the ball. After Maryland scored the first goal, 28 seconds into the game, Loyola waited more than four minutes before shooting, passing around the perimeter, sneaking inside then scurrying back out.</p>
        <p>When they finally drove toward the goal, the ball was blocked by goalie Alex Kahoe and bounded down the field, where it was efficiently scooped up by the scrambling Terrapins.</p>
        <p>Twenty-eight seconds later, Maryland scored again. It was that kind of day for Loyola.</p>
