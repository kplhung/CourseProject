        <p>Nine former friends reunite for an evening of reminiscences in which old scores are settled and new romances nearly bloom. Sound familiar? ''Seduction,'' a ''dance-opera'' presented on Wednesday night at Marymount Manhattan Theater, is the child of ''Contact'' and ''Follies.'' But the performing is so good and the staging so sleek that it all seems fresh again.</p>
        <p>Chet Walker, who conceived, choreographed and directed ''Seduction,'' is probably best known for the Broadway musical ''Fosse,'' which is based on his concept and for which he recreated Bob Fosse's choreography. Blessedly, the dancing in ''Seduction'' has much more to it than the famous Fosse tight limbs and pelvic thrusts. Both the choreography and the songs, composed by Paul Katz and Howard Marren with lyrics by Mr. Katz, give the performers enough material to make something vivid of the characters.</p>

        <p>Nine former friends reunite for an evening of reminiscences in which old scores are settled and new romances nearly bloom. Sound familiar? ''Seduction,'' a ''dance-opera'' presented on Wednesday night at Marymount Manhattan Theater, is the child of ''Contact'' and ''Follies.'' But the performing is so good and the staging so sleek that it all seems fresh again.</p>
        <p>Chet Walker, who conceived, choreographed and directed ''Seduction,'' is probably best known for the Broadway musical ''Fosse,'' which is based on his concept and for which he recreated Bob Fosse's choreography. Blessedly, the dancing in ''Seduction'' has much more to it than the famous Fosse tight limbs and pelvic thrusts. Both the choreography and the songs, composed by Paul Katz and Howard Marren with lyrics by Mr. Katz, give the performers enough material to make something vivid of the characters.</p>
        <p>Michael (Michael Paternostro) has invited his old pals, seemingly all Broadway gypsies, to the reunion at a stylized bar. Brad and Zoie (Brad Musgrove and Zoie Morris Quinde) are a loving young interracial couple. Andrew and Kim (Andrew Fitch and Kim Craven) are cooler and more worldly. T (T. Oliver Reid) is the serene lover of the explosive, somewhat whiny Jonathan (Jonathan Phelps), whom Michael loves unrequitedly. Diana (Diana Laurenson) is an embittered lost soul who hasn't quite shed her dreams and tenacity. The brassy Dede (Dede LaBarre) is there for comic relief. Marty Beller and Roderick L. Jackson provide the evening's live dance music.</p>
        <p>The music and lyrics tend toward a generic bittersweetness, though Mr. Katz has a knockout song in the haunting ''Hold Me,'' a wittily written love song performed compellingly by Mr. Fitch. Some of the voices are hesitant. But the dancing and choreography are terrific. Mr. Phelps stands out in the very good cast for his slyly potent charisma.</p>
        <p>''Seduction'' runs through tomorrow afternoon at Marymount Manhattan (221 East 71st Street).</p>
