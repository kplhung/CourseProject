        <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced on Thursday that it was canceling for now a proposed retrospective of the work of Coco Chanel, the French fashion designer, after weeks of increasing internal debate about the exhibition. It was to be the highlight of the Costume Institute's fall schedule, as well as the backdrop to its glittering annual gala.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the museum said that the death last November of Richard Martin, chief curator of the Costume Institute, made it impossible to organize the exhibition by the scheduled opening date, Dec. 6.</p>
        <p>But it was also evident that the museum had become increasingly sensitive over the issue of commercial sponsorship, and over how much artistic control the House of Chanel -- and specifically, its designer, Karl Lagerfeld -- should be allowed to have over the exhibition.</p>
        <p>The Met and other museums have been accused of allowing their subjects too much influence through their sponsorship. Late last year, for example, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum announced that it would stage an exhibition of clothes by Giorgio Armani, but did not disclose beforehand that Mr. Armani had recently promised it millions.</p>
        <p>In October, the Brooklyn Museum was criticized for taking contributions for ''Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,'' from companies and individuals with a commercial interest in the works, including Charles Saatchi, the owner; Christie's, the auction house; and galleries representing the artists.</p>
        <p>And the Metropolitan has been criticized for the financing of previous shows at the Costume Institute: fashion houses like Dior have sponsored shows devoted to their work, and Conde Nast, the publisher of Vogue, paid for part of the Gianni Versace retrospective.</p>
        <p>Chanel's contribution to mount the retrospective at the Met was said to be as much as $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>Because of Coco Chanel's importance, the Met had planned to display examples of her work in its upstairs exhibition spaces rather than in the basement-level Costume Institute.</p>
        <p>The institute's winter Exhibition is regarded as an important cultural and social event in New York, with many of the city's big charitable donors attending the black-tie opening-night gala. The prospect of having the Chanel show in the upstairs Cantor Galleries would certainly have elevated the annual event's prestige. The Met has not announced what will replace the Chanel show.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Lagerfeld, Chanel's designer for the last 20 years, came to New York to present his ideas for the show to the museum's director, Philippe de Montebello.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagerfeld said in a telephone interview Thursday night that he had proposed an exhibition that combined pieces of Chanel's groundbreaking fashion with examples of work by current artists like Jenny Holzer and Claes Oldenburg. Mr. Lagerfeld said he thought that such an unconventional approach to a fashion exhibition would be in keeping with the iconoclastic spirit of Chanel herself, adding, ''I'm not interested in an exhibit that's just old dresses.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagerfeld said he had been confident after the meeting that the exhibition would proceed as discussed. ''We left on the best of terms,'' he said. ''Then a week later I got a telephone call, very patronizing, from Mr. de Montebello saying there would be no artists.'' Mr. Lagerfeld then proposed an exhibition incorporating video artists, which, he said, he thought satisfied the museum and its curators.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. de Montebello and the museum's curatorial staff became increasingly concerned about the direction of the exhibition and whether the museum was giving too much curatorial control to an outsider. An internal memo was circulated that asked: ''Who's running the museum?''</p>
        <p>The debate became public yesterday when Women's Wear Daily, the trade newspaper, published an interview with Mr. Lagerfeld in which he repeated his complaint that the museum was interested only in ''an exhibit of a bunch of old clothes.''</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Mr. de Montebello sent a memo to the museum's board saying, in part, that it was ''sadly ironic that Karl Lagerfeld, the man who has represented Chanel and creative fashion for some 20 years, could dismiss five decades of the work of Coco Chanel as a 'bunch of old clothes' which only the inclusion of works by contemporary artists in other media could redeem.''</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. de Montebello said that the issue was curatorial integrity. ''It was being eroded, and I simply can't have that,'' he said.</p>
