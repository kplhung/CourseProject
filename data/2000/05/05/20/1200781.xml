        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a clinician who works with battered women, I am all too aware of patterns of abusive behavior. So I was disturbed by the comment of Indiana University's president,  Myles Brand (Sports pages, May 16), that Bob Knight, the university's basketball coach, deserved a ''last chance,'' even after two decades of physical and verbal abuse.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a clinician who works with battered women, I am all too aware of patterns of abusive behavior. So I was disturbed by the comment of Indiana University's president,  Myles Brand (Sports pages, May 16), that Bob Knight, the university's basketball coach, deserved a ''last chance,'' even after two decades of physical and verbal abuse.</p>
        <p>The team, faculty, family and friends of Knight should continue to be concerned. One general apology doesn't wipe out the hurt and humiliation experienced by his victims. Nor does it guarantee anyone's safety. It would be in everyone's best interest if Knight was required to go into an anger management program. The out-of-control behavior signifies deeper issues for Knight.</p>
