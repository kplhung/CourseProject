        <p>Inexperienced players who become nervous in tense competitive situations would be wrong to suppose that experts are immune from this problem.</p>
        <p>In the Cavendish Pairs in Las Vegas a week ago, Marty Fleisher, 41, a Manhattan lawyer, was on the brink of his first big victory and determined to avoid error. In the final session he was delighted when he became dummy, leaving the hard work to his partner, Eric Rodwell, a multiple world champion. And the end result was victory, with bunches of national and international stars trailing.</p>
        <p>Fleisher, who won the 1999 New York Player of the Year title for overall performance, held the West cards on the diagramed deal. With the vulnerability in his favor, he ventured a weak two-bid in spades.</p>
        <p>Many modern experts have abandoned traditional standards in this area and consider a moderate five-card suit a sufficient basis for a weak two-bid.</p>
        <p>South made a sensible jump to three no-trump, and West had a lead problem. One of the purposes of his opening bid was to direct his partner to lead a spade. Now the effect was to direct himself to lead a nonspade.</p>
        <p>South was apparently prepared for spades, and if East held an honor in the suit he might have raised immediately, or even doubled the final contract to call for a spade lead.</p>
        <p>Study of the diagram reveals that South makes nine tricks easily after a spade lead. If West leads anything else the defense is in control, and he chose a club. South made a good decision by playing low from dummy, and East won with the king.</p>
        <p>Now the defense could attack dummy's crucial spade entry. On the lead of the six, the ten, jack and ace were played. Holding up the ace would not have helped the declarer, who next took a winning heart finesse. South led his remaining club and finessed, losing to the ace.</p>
        <p>A spade lead was won by West, who now had to be careful. A black-suit return would have given South his ninth trick, but Fleisher read the position accurately and led a diamond into the declarer's strength. South had eight tricks, but had to concede two spade tricks at the finish for down one.</p>
        <p>The eventual winners gained 139 imps, based on comparisons with the 24 other tables. Most North-South pairs had a plus score, either by resting in a partial or by making three no-trump when West had failed to direct himself not to lead a spade.</p>
        <p>The Eastern States Regional Championships begin on Wednesday at the Sheraton Parsippany Hotel, 199 Smith Road, Parsippany, N.J. One-session events are played throughout.</p>
