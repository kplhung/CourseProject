        <p>Even now, six months after her decision, Najah Bazzy's family is still upset with her. Her 14-year-old daughter pleads with her to reconsider. Older relatives fear that she has offended God.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Bazzy is resolute. When she dies, her heart, liver, kidney and lungs will be donated. While thousands of other people have made the decision to sign organ donor cards or become live donors, Mrs. Bazzy's declaration is controversial. As an Arab-American Muslim, she is part of a community that ardently believes it is forbidden for Muslims to donate organs, even to a relative. To see Heaven, they say, their bodies must return to God in one piece.</p>
        <p>These days, that notion is being challenged as increasing numbers of Arab-Americans here in what is perhaps their largest and most influential community in the United States, as well as their relatives back home, are found to have liver and kidney disease.</p>
        <p>''There is a saying in Islam: He who saves a life saves humanity,'' said Mrs. Bazzy, a 40-year-old Lebanese transcultural nurse who is spearheading an initiative to include in Islamic wills a section for organ donations. ''Why are we so eager to take our organs with us and give up the opportunity to save a life? How do I know I'm not depriving the world of a genius?''</p>
        <p>That is why religious leaders are rallying with doctors and community outreach workers to dispel a decades-old myth that the Koran forbids organ donation.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the International Association for Organ Donation, a year-old nonprofit organization founded by a former marketing executive whose teenage son was battling kidney disease, has started an education campaign. By introducing reluctant donors to Arab-American  patients waiting for transplants and by holding dinners, distributing posters, bumper stickers and T-shirts, the group hopes to sign up thousands of the more than 275,000 Arabs here and in parts of Detroit. Doctors say organ transplants between relatives or people of the same ethnicity have a higher rate of success.</p>
        <p>''There is no Islamic taboo banning the donation of organs,'' said Imam Hassan Qzawani, who heads the Islamic Center of America, which has more than 8,000 members and is one of Detroit's largest mosques. ''People have reservations because it was not practiced in the old countries and because of Islam's strict guidelines about disfiguring the body. But as long as you're not giving your eyes or an organ that is needed for one's own survival, we have the right to help save someone's life.''</p>
        <p>Nadia Hammoud, 29, tried desperately last year to persuade her father to accept a kidney from his son. But he opted for a cadaver donation, which later failed.</p>
        <p>''He would have waited another eight years rather than take it from my brother,'' Ms. Hammoud said.</p>
        <p>In Michigan, about 20 people are waiting for either a kidney or liver transplant, said the Gift of Life Transplant Society of Michigan, which only last year started studying Arabs as a separate group. In the last six years, only one Arab-American donated an organ in Michigan, though at least a dozen have received transplants, doctors and organ donation researchers say.</p>
        <p>Of the 69,399 patients waiting for organ transplants in the United States, it is unclear how many are Arabs. The United Network for Organ Sharing, in Richmond, Va., which oversees transplants in the United States, traditionally counts Arabs as Caucasian, a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>But Joanna El Hajj, a health care coordinator at the Arab Community Center for Economics and Social Service, said she needed only to pick up her phone to know that the numbers were growing. The calls come with frightening frequency, Mrs. El Hajj says. Almost every day she is talking to someone, or the relative of someone, waiting for a kidney, liver or bone marrow transplant. The center routinely sponsors fund-raisers to help patients across the country pay medical bills and bring sick relatives to the United States for help.</p>
        <p>''Four years ago, I would get maybe one call, two calls,'' said Mrs. El Hajj, who recently decided to become a donor. ''Now, every day there is a new case. I get calls from Tulsa, from Boston, Maryland, Jordan, Iraq. We can't continue to ignore what is happening.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. El Hajj, who received a heart tissue transplant 26 years ago in London, has a theory about the increase in need: ''We're seeing the aftereffects of war, I believe. A lot of the people who are coming, they lived through the chemical pollution of the civil wars in Iraq and Lebanon. It's like in Vietnam when they sprayed the gases, you only see the effects over a period.''</p>
        <p>Others believe that the Arab population is merely in the midst of growing pains.</p>
        <p>''Anytime you have an immigrant community this large, eventually they will develop the same disease as the larger population,'' said Marwan Aboujould, director of transplant surgery at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. ''The problem is that medical technology and the population have surpassed the community's education.</p>
        <p>''That can be as hard to overcome as issues of culture and faith.''</p>
