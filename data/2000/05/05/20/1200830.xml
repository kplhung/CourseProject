        <p>The horse of the moment, Fusaichi Pegasus, was snugged down in his barn at Pimlico Race Course today on the eve of the Preakness, but one unexpected complication fell on him and his seven rivals: rain.</p>
        <p>The rain was heavy at times, and it was supposed to linger, with showers predicted on Saturday morning followed by clouds all day and the temperature on the cool side, in the mid to upper 60's. But rain or shine, the ''flying horse'' remained the 3-5 favorite to win the Preakness and to advance to the Belmont Stakes in New York on June 10 with a chance to win the Triple Crown.</p>
        <p>The Preakness will be run at 5:27 p.m. on Saturday with a purse of $1 million at a distance of a mile and three-sixteenths.</p>
        <p>Neil Drysdale, who trains Fusaichi Pegasus, remembered that his star won the Wood Memorial in New York last month on a rainy track that was listed as ''wet-fast.'' But his five other races were all run on fast tracks, and the Pimlico track was fast early this morning when the colt went galloping for Drysdale.</p>
        <p>''The workout went faster,'' Drysdale said, ''because his stablemate and workmate went off a little quick. But it was all right. He came out of it fine.''</p>
        <p>None of the eight horses in the Preakness have had much exposure to rain, although Captain Steve won the Breeders' Futurity at Keeneland last October on a sloppy track. In the Kentucky Derby, Captain Steve poked his head in front as the 19 horses headed for home, but he was bumped by Wheelaway and finished eighth.</p>
        <p>''What I really want to see,'' Bob Baffert, his trainer, said, ''is for the real Captain Steve to show up and run like I know he can. I think he moves up on a wet track. He's had only the one race in the slop, and he won that.''</p>
        <p>Harold Rose, the 88-year-old owner and trainer of Hal's Hope, who ran 16th in the Kentucky Derby after winning the Florida Derby, said that his horse was fit and that rain would be welcomed.</p>
        <p>''The cut he suffered on his right front leg when he stumbled coming out of the starting gate in the Kentucky Derby is completely healed,'' Rose said. ''I wouldn't mind if we had rain. He's never run on an off track. But he's worked fine in the slop, and his pedigree says he can handle a wet track.''</p>
        <p>Baffert visualized four speed horses leading the field around the track, with four closers stalking them for the critical run down the stretch.</p>
        <p>''I think the horses will run in two tiers,'' he said, ''with Hugh Hefner, Hal's Hope, High Yield and Snuck In all up close to the lead. We'll be in the second tier. A lot depends on the track condition. But I want my rider, Robby Albarado, to put Captain Steve where he's comfortable. I'd like him to sit and relax, and make one run.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale said that he wants Fusaichi Pegasus to show more speed in the Preakness than he did in the Derby, when he went from 15th place on the first turn to take the lead in the homestretch. Once the speed horses begin to fade, the closers should be moving up, led by Fusaichi Pegasus, Red Bullet and Impeachment, who are widely expected to be involved in a late showdown with High Yield.</p>
        <p>D. Wayne Lukas, the trainer of High Yield, has won the Kentucky Derby four times, the Preakness five times and the Belmont Stakes three times. ''I don't think horsemen and some of the public are as ready to concede the Preakness to Fusaichi Pegasus,'' he said. ''You've got to remember that he has to run in these races. That's why the Triple Crown is here, and it's so tough. You win one or two and you think, or hope, that you can go all the way.''</p>
        <p>He paused, and added from long experience, ''But that's why they run these races.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>KENT DESORMEAUX, who won the Kentucky Derby two weeks ago aboard Fusaichi Pegasus, continued to win the big ones when he guided Jostle home first in the $200,000 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes for fillies on Friday. Jostle, a daughter of Brocco owned by RICHARD C. PORTER II and trained by JOHN SERVIS, rushed into first place in the homestretch after Cash Run had led from the start. At the finish, she had two and a half lengths on March Magic, with Impending Bear third and Cash Run fourth. The winner, fourth in the betting at 6-1, ran the mile and an eighth in 1:522/5  after fast early fractions set by Cash Run, who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies last year for D. WAYNE LUKAS. But when Cash Run tired in the stretch, Jostle moved into the lead from her stalking position and won with command. She improved her career record to five victories with two second-place finishes in nine starts.</p>
