        <p>United States stock markets suffered another down trading session yesterday as investors became increasingly afraid that the Federal Reserve plans to raise short-term interest rates through the summer.</p>
        <p>Technology stocks led the way down, with the Nasdaq composite index falling 148.31 points, or 4.2 percent, to 3,390.40.

        <p>United States stock markets suffered another down trading session yesterday as investors became increasingly afraid that the Federal Reserve plans to raise short-term interest rates through the summer.</p>
        <p>Technology stocks led the way down, with the Nasdaq composite index falling 148.31 points, or 4.2 percent, to 3,390.40. But other indexes were not spared, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index down 30.26 points, or 2.1 percent, at 1,406.95. The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 10,626.85, down 150.43 points, or 1.4 percent.</p>
        <p>As has been the case for most of May, trading volume yesterday was light, with investors in no hurry to buy the new-economy companies they craved so ardently earlier this year.</p>
        <p>Investors had shaken off their pessimism earlier, with rallies on Monday and Tuesday in advance of the Federal Reserve's decision to raise short-term interest rates by half a percentage point. Bulls had hoped that Tuesday's increase might be the Fed's last, because rate increases slow the economy and can hurt corporate profits.</p>
        <p>But now investors seem to think that the Fed is not done. ''After the rate hike, there was temporary euphoria. People said, 'They did 50 basis points. Phew, that's going to be it,' '' said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners, which manages more than $1 billion. ''Now people are saying that there's going to be more.'' (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)</p>
        <p>Barton Biggs, the global strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and a longtime bear, said he expected more rate increases. ''The cyclical news on inflation is not good. Wage costs are increasing, and wage costs are sticky, so once they get embedded in the system, it's not so easy to get them out,'' he said. With energy prices also increasing, the Fed has no choice but to raise rates to slow the economy, Mr. Biggs said.</p>
        <p>''Interest rates are going up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In addition, many money managers say they believe that the biggest technology companies will have to drop further before they are reasonably valued compared with  both nontechnology companies and smaller  Internet-focused technology names like Ariba and Phone.com. Last month's sell-off brutalized the money-losing companies that soared to huge valuations in 1999 and early 2000 as investors threw aside traditional valuation measures. Some of those stocks are down as much as 80 percent from their highs of March.</p>
        <p>But their bigger cousins, like Cisco, Oracle and JDS Uniphase, have come through the last two months relatively unscathed. At 53 7/16, Cisco is down roughly one-third from its March 27 high of 82. Oracle has dropped to 70 1/16 from 90, a 22 percent slide.</p>
        <p>Still,the technology leaders are hardly cheap. Both Cisco and Oracle trade at more than 100 times trailing earnings, almost four times the valuation of the average S.&amp; P. 500 company and a level rarely seen before the last two years. Now, many professionals think the rout in the technology sector will not end until even the megacaps feel significant pain.</p>
        <p>''The bear market is incomplete in technology stocks and the Nasdaq,'' Mr. Biggs said. ''In this next stage, the big-cap tech companies that are wonderful companies but very overpriced stocks are going to get hit.'' He expects the Nasdaq to fall below 3,000, a drop of more than 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter and a longtime technology bull, expects the Nasdaq to remain at its current levels until the fourth quarter of this year, when earnings at leading technology companies finally begin to catch up with their stocks.</p>
        <p>''Some of the smaller ones are getting reasonable, but you look at a Microsoft or Cisco, and they've come down by half, and they're still expensive,'' Mr. Murphy said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Murphy said he did not think the Nasdaq would fall below 3,321.29, its April 14 low, and he advised investors to remain patient.  Demand for technology stocks is stronger than ever, he said.</p>
        <p>''What's supporting the market is earnings. Earnings are just great,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''Internet traffic is still doubling every 100 days. That's a huge driver. Computing is strong; communications is very strong, and consequently, semiconductors look good.''</p>
        <p>Michael Manns, senior portfolio manager at American Express Asset Management in Minneapolis, said he did not expect to see a commitment of capital to technology stocks until the Fed finishes raising short-term rates. ''Investors are nervous,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Manns plans to keep buying technology and telecommunications. He recently attended a conference of automotive and industrial companies and found they were spending heavily on Internet equipment as a way to cut their operating expenses.</p>
        <p>''Industrial companies are looking at the Internet as a really concrete way to lower their procurement costs and rationalize S.G.&amp; A.,'' Mr. Manns said, using a common term for selling, general and administrative expenses, or corporate overhead.</p>
        <p>''This is the area of growth in the marketplace,'' he said. ''I'm willing to go ahead and buy on the dips.''</p>
        <p>For now, individual investors seem to concur. AMG Research, which tracks purchases and sales of mutual funds, said $7.9 billion flowed into stock funds for the week ended May 17, including almost $600 million into technology funds.</p>
