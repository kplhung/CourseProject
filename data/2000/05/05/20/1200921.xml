        <p>SAWHILL-John C. New York University mourns the passing of its 12th President, John Sawhill. He was a man of vision, wisdom and wide-ranging talents. He took office during difficult times, but through his genius for finance and administration, he was able to put the University on a sound footing and permitted to embark on the course that has brought it to the stature it today enjoys. He brought diversity to the University's leadership, and he created the culture that emphasizes the centrality of the Arts and Science. For what NYU is today, this community owes a great debt of gratitude to John Sawhill. We offer our deepest sympathy to his loved ones and many friends. He will be remembered in these halls with respect and admiration. L. Jay Oliva, President Martin Lipton, Chairman, Board of Trustees</p>
        <p>SAWHILL-John. The Board and staff of Environmental Defense are deeply saddened by the death of John Sawhill. He lifted the Nature Conservancy to new levels of achievement. He was a generous friend and mentor to his colleagues in the environmental community. The entire country has benefited-and will long benefit-from his vision and leadership on conservation issues.</p>
