        <p>The leaders of Serbia's political opposition finally emerged from their private meetings and spoke to their supporters tonight, telling a rally of fewer than 5,000 people that they would fly to Moscow next week and ask Russia to help moderate the policies of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>It seemed to some an odd gesture from the opposition, just three days after Mr. Milosevic's government seized the main opposition television station, Belgrade's Studio B, and silenced independent broadcasting in the capital, including radio B2-92.</p>

        <p>The leaders of Serbia's political opposition finally emerged from their private meetings and spoke to their supporters tonight, telling a rally of fewer than 5,000 people that they would fly to Moscow next week and ask Russia to help moderate the policies of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>It seemed to some an odd gesture from the opposition, just three days after Mr. Milosevic's government seized the main opposition television station, Belgrade's Studio B, and silenced independent broadcasting in the capital, including radio B2-92.</p>
        <p>Vuk Draskovic, leader of the main opposition party, the Socialist Renewal Movement, returned from Montenegro to appeal for calm, saying, ''No television station or government authority is worth a single life.''</p>
        <p>Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party, announced a large rally to be held in Belgrade a week from Saturday. ''We will see who is bigger,'' he said. ''We'll see if they send cordons of police against a million people.''</p>
        <p>But he made no mention of the plans he says he favors for widespread civil disobedience to protest government's moves against the independent media, and it seemed highly unlikely that a million people -- more than five times the size of Belgrade's biggest rally in the last two years -- would turn out here.</p>
        <p>There were scattered clashes with the police the first two nights of these rallies, with up to 150 injured nationwide, including at least 4 police officers, and 40 people detained. But tonight, both sides seemed listless, and there was no confrontation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic, appealing for peaceful resistance, said that he, Zoran Djindjic of the Democratic Party and Vojislav Kostunica, leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, would go to Moscow, a traditional Serbian ally, next week hoping to see President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's government has promised Mr. Milosevic energy aid and loans, and recently was host to Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic and Defense Minister Dragoljub Ojdanic, who has been indicted on charges of  war crimes in Kosovo. But Mr. Putin's government has also been host to Mr. Draskovic and high-ranking Serbian Orthodox leaders opposed to Mr. Milosevic in the past.</p>
        <p>In an interview later, Mr. Draskovic said that Russia was the only country that could influence Mr. Milosevic and to which the opposition could appeal without being accused of toadying to NATO, which bombed Yugoslavia last year.</p>
        <p>''After NATO's aggression against Serbia, the majority of Serbs are very, very disappointed by the fact that NATO, including our traditional allies, bombed our country without even a formal decision of Security Council of the United Nations,'' Mr. Draskovic said in words unlikely to be welcomed in the West. ''Our people don't accept so frankly initiatives from the Western countries who bombed us, and secondly, Russia opposes sanctions against our state and nation.''</p>
        <p>The party of Mr. Milosevic's wife, the Yugoslav United Left, part of the ruling coalition, said today that it was preparing a new law against terrorism that is widely expected to be used against the opposition, including the student movement Otpor, or Resistance.</p>
        <p>The new law is said to be largely based on the British law against terrorism used in Northern Ireland that allows detention without trial. Predrag Simic, a Draskovic adviser, said sardonically tonight, ''We can now say that the regime is taking something from the West.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 21, 2000, Sunday  An article yesterday about the Serbian opposition misstated the name of the opposition party led by Vuk Draskovic. It is the Serbian Renewal Movement, not the Socialist Renewal Movement.</p>
