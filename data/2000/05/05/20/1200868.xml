        <p>How many moralists can dance on the head of a pin? The more the merrier.</p>
        <p>On its way to yesterday's touching climax, in which New York's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, was reborn as Jimmy Stewart's George Bailey in ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' the Rudy-Judi-Donna-Cristyne soap opera has offered many memorable sideshows: an aggrieved wife's press conference outside a cardinal's wake, a rollicking new Abe Hirschfeld campaign for senator, an eBay auction of a mayoral galpal's high school yearbook. But none topped the spirited tap-dancing of Clinton-bashers as they labored to draw fine distinctions between White House and Gracie Mansion infidelities.</p>
        <p>''At least his affair is the traditional Other Woman kind, as would suit a conservative,'' wrote Danielle Crittenden in Slate. According to Andrea Peyser of The New York Post, ''He didn't lie, he didn't fudge, he didn't equivocate. . . . He spoke the truth, no more, no less.'' Paul Gigot found an ''all-too-human'' mayor, a ''vulnerable soul'' with ''a sense of regret, even remorse.'' Peggy Noonan told National Review Online that ''Rudy is normal compared to Clinton,'' and praised the mayor in The Wall Street Journal for being ''ragged and human'' and refraining from ''finger wagging.'' For Ann Coulter, there's the Talmudic difference ''between a dirtbag and a dirtbag and a felon.''</p>
        <p>In ''The Hillary Trap,'' her new entry into the crowded anti-Hillary book sweepstakes, Laura Ingraham faults the Clintons for holding ''the modern view that moral values are relative.'' But her tome had the misfortune to be published just as the Giuliani marital meltdown confirmed that moral relativity is in the eye of the beholder and is becoming an epidemic among conservatives, who only last month put aside family-values absolutes to oppose the reunion of Elian Gonzalez with his dad.</p>
        <p>Thus did many of the scolds who bemoaned the dreadful example set by Monicagate for the American people's children make no mention whatsoever of children in Judigate -- neither the American people's nor the Giulianis' own. Those who accused Bill Clinton of sliming the discarded women in his life gleefully trashed Donna Hanover, either for her taste in Off Broadway stage roles or for defying her husband. (''New Yorkers never really liked Donna Hanover to begin with,'' opined Dick Morris, accusing her of exploiting her marriage to advance her career.) Those who berated Mr. Clinton for allegedly using Arkansas state troopers to further his sexual misadventures were mum about the N.Y.P.D. honor guard at the Rudy-Judi trysts in the Hamptons. Those who decried Vernon Jordan's thwarted effort to secure Monica Lewinsky an entry-level job at Revlon ignored the mayor's successful installation of Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas in a $150,000 taxpayer-subsidized job at the city's tourism bureau.</p>
        <p>And some of those who ridiculed Mrs. Clinton for her theory that a ''vast right-wing conspiracy'' had targeted her husband dropped hints that a left-wing conspiracy had set up Mr. Giuliani. Both Mr. Morris and Robert Novak have gone on TV to float the notion that, as Mr. Novak ominously intoned, Mr. Giuliani's marital problems ''may not'' be ''all of his own doing,'' since ''bad things happen'' to ''people who go up against the Clintons.''</p>
        <p>Only a few conservatives resisted this moral-relativism epidemic. Hours before the mayor's withdrawal, William Bennett called him ''loutish'' and urged him not to run. Earlier and gutsier was Maggie Gallagher in The Post, who took on the ''repulsive'' spin doctors in her own political camp: ''Suddenly, adultery is nothing, and telling the truth about adultery makes you a stand-up guy.'' Ms. Gallagher went so far as to say that the mayor ''made Bill Clinton look good as a husband and father.''</p>
        <p>But I don't buy the argument that the mayor is a total hypocrite. Yes, his serial attachments (according to Ms. Hanover's allegation) would seem to contradict his endorsement of public-school displays of the Ten Commandments, his zero tolerance of sex shops and his policing of museums for salacious art. But is he really being inconsistent when he humiliates his wife and his two school-age children by informing them of his divorce plans by press conference or by parading down Second Avenue with his ''very good friend'' for the paparazzi? He has treated his own family with the exact same compassion and sensitivity that he lavished upon the family of Patrick Dorismond -- no hypocrisy there!</p>
        <p>I'd also posit that this whole soap opera is in some ways a public service, since Mr. Giuliani, intentionally or not, helped uncloset one of the most common traumas of modern America -- divorce. For it is divorce, not extracurricular romance, that made this ''scandal'' novel. We have become inured to infidelities in officialdom, especially among Gingrich Republicans, but this is the first time most of us have watched a political leader's wandering morph before our eyes into a high-profile divorce, complete with male midlife crisis and hovering lawyers, that played out in full view on television in real time. For those of us who've been through divorce, there is cathartic value in seeing that the high, mighty and normally self-possessed can behave as childishly and be hurt as badly as the rest of us at that tragic moment when a marriage dies.</p>
        <p>The good news for Mr. Giuliani, should he run for governor in '02, is the burgeoning size of this constituency. According to a Rutgers study last year, divorce rates have risen 30 percent since 1970, the marriage rate has fallen faster, and only some 38 percent of Americans who are married pronounce themselves very happy in that state. (The figure was 53 percent 25 years ago.) Nearly 50 percent of all American marriages end in divorce. Yet divorce and unhappy marriages are underrepresented as a phenomenon in mainstream mass culture; it's easier to find homosexuality on prime-time TV than it is to find divorce. This may be one reason national audiences proved far more hungry than Hollywood expected for a movie like ''American Beauty'' and a TV series like ''Once and Again,'' a rare network drama centered on divorce. The phenomenon of ''The Sopranos'' may be less fueled by its mafioso operatics than by its realistic presentation of the chilled marriage of Tony and Carmela Soprano and its fallout on their children. Not for nothing has the mayor declared it a personal favorite.</p>
        <p>But political punditry seems completely clueless about the state of American marriage. ''New York is France,'' quipped George Stephanopoulos of ABC, explaining why 81 percent of New Yorkers told pollsters that the Giulianis' separation wasn't going to change their votes. But in fact New York State has the lowest divorce rate in the country, whereas in the Bible Belt divorce rates are so high that Oklahoma has some counties where divorces outnumber marriages. Mr. Stephanopoulos was one of many commentators who, in the immediate aftermath of the Giulianis' dueling press conferences, fell victim to the Sam Donaldson syndrome -- instantly asserting that domestic mayhem had effectively ''ended'' the mayor's campaign, much as Mr. Donaldson pronounced Mr. Clinton's presidency ''numbered in days'' after Monicagate broke. These prognosticators, so quick to assume widespread public condemnation of marital sinners, don't seem to realize that, sadly, it's happy marriages, not broken ones, that are increasingly the aberration where their viewers live. In truth, as Mr. Giuliani indicated yesterday, it was solely the battle against cancer, not the one against his wife, that knocked him out of the race.</p>
        <p>Of course some anti-Clinton moralists are now holding the president accountable for the resiliency of Mayor Giuliani's post-Judi poll numbers; under this theory it was Monicagate that lowered acceptable standards for politicians' behavior. But the record shows that when the mayor was reported by Vanity Fair to be involved with Ms. Lategano in the summer of '97 -- the year before Monicagate -- the same polls showed that 85 percent of voters didn't care then either.</p>
        <p>It's not that the public has been corrupted, or is latently Gallic, but that it has too often experienced marital heartbreak firsthand. Anyone who has done so knows that only fools can presume to judge what goes on in someone else's marriage. And they know as well that it is difficult but possible to perform in a job, whether in the public or private sector, even as a family breaks apart. For millions of Americans, that's not a scandal -- it's just another normal day at the office.</p>
