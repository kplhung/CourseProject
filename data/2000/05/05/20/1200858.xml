        <p>At an unusual meeting convened by the Food and Drug Administration to discuss its decision in March to take the diabetes drug Rezulin off the market, doctors warned that patients taking two newer, related drugs, Avandia and Actos, should also be checked carefully for signs of liver trouble.</p>
        <p>''Watch out, watch out,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, a researcher at Rockefeller University and a member of the expert panel that advised the F.D.A. about Rezulin. ''I would monitor them to beat the band.''</p>
        <p>The newer drugs, both approved last year to treat type 2 diabetes, are thought to be safer than Rezulin, but doctors have urged caution because they belong to the same class of drugs as Rezulin, known as glitazones.</p>
        <p>All three drugs help to lower blood sugar by improving the body's ability to use insulin. Rezulin was the first of this class, and it was hailed by many diabetics and their doctors when it was introduced in 1997.</p>
        <p>But Rezulin, made by Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert, caused 90 cases of liver failure. Drug agency scientists said today they still did not know how the drug damaged the liver, or how to identify people who might be especially vulnerable to such damage.</p>
        <p>Avandia has been linked to two cases of liver failure, but one of the patients had also taken Rezulin. One patient died, and the other recovered without a transplant. No cases of liver failure have been reported with Actos.</p>
        <p>Patients taking the newer drugs are supposed to have blood tests to check their liver function before starting treatment, repeat the tests every two months during the first year of treatment and then continue regular testing at intervals determined by their doctors.</p>
        <p>Rezulin was initially marketed in 1997 without instructions for liver function tests. Testing recommendations were added after problems became apparent, but later surveys by the agency showed that few patients were getting the required tests. Doctors say some, but not all, of the cases of liver failure might have been prevented by regular testing. Some cases occurred in people who were being tested regularly but suddenly developed liver failure between tests.</p>
        <p>Of the 90 patients with liver failure, 63 died. Nearly 2 million people had taken the drug at one time or another.</p>
        <p>Although Actos and Avandia are marketed for use in most patients with type 2 diabetes, Dr. Hirsch said they should be used only when other treatments have failed. He said he was concerned about the newer drugs because many patients taking them had successfully taken Rezulin, and had switched only because Rezulin was pulled off the market.</p>
        <p>The fact that they had been able to take Rezulin safely might mean that they are not susceptible to problems from the newer drugs. That pool of patients, whom Dr. Hirsch called ''Rezulin survivors,'' might make Actos and Avandia appear safer than they really are, he said.</p>
        <p>Later, as more and more new patients who have never tried a glitazone drug take Actos and Avandia, problems could show up, Dr. Hirsch said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Murray Lumpkin, deputy director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the agency, said that if liver problems occurred in patients on Actos or Avandia who had already taken Rezulin, it would be difficult to figure out which drug was to blame.</p>
        <p>Food and Drug Administration officials do not normally convene meetings to discuss drugs that they have already taken off the market.</p>
        <p>The agency pulled Rezulin without consulting its advisory panel, which in March of 1999 had recommended leaving the drug on the market, with restrictions. Panel members were invited to today's meeting, and some expressed puzzlement over the purpose of the session.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lumpkin said the purpose was partly to reassure panel members that the agency had not disregarded their views.</p>
        <p>He explained and defended the agency's decision, saying that Rezulin was kept on the market even after problems developed because it seemed to be helping more patients than it harmed. But once alternatives became available that were apparently safer, he said, Rezulin was ''outmoded.''</p>
        <p>The decision was criticized by several doctors at the meeting who said the agency had acted in haste, and had taken a valuable drug away from their patients.</p>
        <p>Personal-injury lawyers also offered criticism, insisting that the agency had not acted fast enough, and should have pulled Rezulin sooner.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lumpkin said the fact that liver problems quickly became apparent represented a success of the agency's system for collecting reports of adverse effects from drugs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hirsch said: ''It's also a failure of the system. A bunch of people died.''</p>
