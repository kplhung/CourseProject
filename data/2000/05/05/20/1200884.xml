        <p>When Rick A. Lazio, the Long Island congressman, first began mulling a bid for the United States Senate last year, his biggest drawback was perceived as his lack of name recognition in a race that was fast becoming defined by celebrity and star quality.</p>

        <p>When Rick A. Lazio, the Long Island congressman, first began mulling a bid for the United States Senate last year, his biggest drawback was perceived as his lack of name recognition in a race that was fast becoming defined by celebrity and star quality.</p>
        <p>Now his supporters are hoping to turn that seeming weakness into his biggest strength. Mr. Lazio may be a virtual unknown, their line of reasoning goes, but at least he does not arouse the strong antipathy inspired in certain quarters by both the man he hopes to succeed, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and the Democrat he hopes to challenge, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>''He's a moderate Republican, he's telegenic,'' said Howard C. DeMartini, who was the chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Party when Mr. Lazio was first elected to Congress here in 1992. ''He will be able to turn the focus of the campaign back onto the first lady. Over the last few months, Hillary has been able to shift the focus away from herself and onto the mayor.''</p>
        <p>Now that Mr. Giuliani has withdrawn from the race, Mr. Lazio suddenly finds himself being urged to run by many of the same Republican leaders who spent much of the year trying to talk him out of the campaign.</p>
        <p>He was the only Republican mentioned today by Mr. Giuliani, who in withdrawing from the race offered his support to Mr. Lazio if he decided to seek their party's nomination to challenge Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Tonight, at a cancer forum Mr. Lazio had organized at the Eastern Long Island campus of St. John's University, the congressman said he would indeed run, and would make an official announcement soon.</p>
        <p>The turn of events left Mr. Lazio, 42, in the position of an ambitious understudy suddenly thrust into a starring role. As harried aides fielded calls from reporters around the world and long-dormant volunteers got out their Lazio for Senate T-shirts, Mr. Lazio returned from Washington to attend the cancer forum and to hastily assemble a campaign staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio emerged as the likely candidate to succeed Mr. Giuliani after Republican officials spent several anxious weeks searching for a possible replacement. Some had hoped Gov. George E. Pataki would run for the seat, but the governor declined. Peter T. King, a congressman from neighboring Nassau County, would like to run for the seat but has had difficulty winning the backing of party leaders.</p>
        <p>A former congressman from Westchester County, Joseph J. DioGuardi, has said that he will seek the support of the Conservative, Right to Life and Independence Parties in a run for the Senate.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Lazio is something of a blank slate to most New York voters right now, friends and foes alike will waste no time trying to mark him up with their own labels.</p>
        <p>Supporters will stress Mr. Lazio's credentials as a moderate, middle-of-the-road Republican congressman who is more interested in policy than in politics. Opponents will paint him further to the right and accuse him of being driven more by political ambition than by personal conviction, and of trying to please all sides on certain hot-button issues.</p>
        <p>''There's going to be a lot of angst over shorthand for who I am,'' Mr. Lazio said recently. ''Put in today's shorthand parlance, you'd probably consider me fiscally responsible, right of center on budget and tax issues, and on social issues more pragmatic.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, whose district centers on Babylon and Islip in western Suffolk, can indeed be hard to peg. He is a self-described moderate Republican who allied himself with Newt Gingrich when Mr. Gingrich was the House speaker. He is a supporter of  many of President Clinton's policies who voted to impeach the president.</p>
        <p>He is a Republican who supports abortion rights but voted to override President Clinton's veto of the ban on a form of late-term abortions. He is a former prosecutor who supported the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban, but then dismayed some gun control advocates last year by voting first for a tough Democratic gun bill, only to then support a weaker one endorsed by the National Rifle Association.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Lazio said his divergent opinions should not be seen either as waffling or as an attempt to seem all things to all people. ''I choose to let the debate unfold, to listen to people make their arguments,'' he said. ''I have never been persuaded that I have to come out of the box and make knee-jerk decisions.''</p>
        <p>He portrays himself as a hard-working lawmaker who enjoys the intricacies of writing legislation and ushering it through, who prefers working on housing bills to participating in ideological debates.</p>
        <p>As for his position on abortion, he said, ''I am not in favor of outlawing it or making it a crime, but I can make the moral distinction about partial-birth abortions.'' And he called the vote to impeach the president ''terribly depressing.''</p>
        <p>''It was almost like a death in the family,'' he said. ''But it's not a vote that I regret. I think it was the right vote in terms of the rule of law.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio grew up in West Islip. His father, Anthony, was the administrative assistant to the Suffolk County Republican leader. After graduating from Vassar College and getting his law degree from American University, Rick Lazio became an assistant district attorney in Suffolk County. In 1989, he was elected to the Suffolk County Legislature.</p>
        <p>People who have watched his career since then say that his ambition and centrist stance are not new.</p>
        <p>''I got the impression that he was trying not to generate controversy, trying a middle-of-the-road, make-no-enemies approach,'' said Paul Sabatino, a fellow Republican who is counsel to the Suffolk Legislature. ''It was always clear that he was running for higher office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio got his chance in 1992, when he took on Representative Thomas Downey, a nine-term Democratic incumbent, and won an upset victory. Mr. Lazio was initially down in the polls by more than 20 points, and was outspent in the race by roughly $1.4 million to $275,000, but he was able to eke out a victory. He assailed Mr. Downey's overdrafts at the House Bank and accused him of accepting travel junkets and of being out of touch with Long Island.</p>
        <p>''Lazio spent most of his money in the last 15 days hammering Downey on those issues,'' said Mr. DeMartini, the former Republican leader. ''He couldn't afford to compete dollar for dollar, so he made an early decision to husband his money, be positive in the beginning of the race and then use paid media to attack Downey. And it paid off.''</p>
        <p>Since then, he has been re-elected handily. In 1998, his most recent opponent, John C. Bace, tried unsuccessfully to paint Mr. Lazio as a Gingrich Republican. Mr. Lazio won with 66 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Now he lives in Bay Shore with his wife, Patricia, and his daughters, Molly Ann and Kelsey. When not working, he likes to play the guitar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's current status is an unlikely sequel to his on-again, off-again flirtation with a run for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mr. Lazio sought support from Republicans who were concerned that Mr. Giuliani was either too liberal or too city-oriented.  Many party loyalists had simply never forgiven Mr. Giuliani for endorsing Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, for governor in 1994.</p>
        <p>Early in the campaign, the man who beat Mr. Cuomo, Governor Pataki, appeared to be quietly helping Mr. Lazio. Aides to Mr. Pataki denied this, but the governor remained studiously neutral in the race.</p>
        <p>Then, in August, Mr. Pataki endorsed Mr. Giuliani and urged Mr. Lazio to abandon his bid. A few days later Mr. Lazio dropped out of the race, urging Mr. Giuliani to formally declare his candidacy by Aug. 31. The mayor scoffed at his request.</p>
        <p>But the idea of a Lazio campaign did not die. In February, after the chairman of the state's Conservative Party, Michael Long, criticized Mr. Giuliani and said that Mr. Lazio would make the better candidate, Mr. Lazio announced that he had still not ruled out a run.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mr. Lazio criticized Mr. Giuliani on national television for the way the mayor handled the fallout from the March 16 shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed man who was killed by New York City police officers. ''We are in the process of potentially blowing this race,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
        <p>Late last month, Mr. Giuliani announced that he had prostate cancer and was not sure whether he would stay in the race. Mr. Lazio expressed concerns that there might not be enough time left to raise the money necessary to defeat Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>A poll released Tuesday by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute found Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Lazio, 50 percent to 31 percent. But Mr. Lazio's supporters said they would not make too much of that.</p>
        <p>''He's an aggressive candidate,'' Mr. DeMartini said.</p>
