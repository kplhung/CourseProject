        <p>It took three days for Ethiopian troops to battle their way into this town, and now that they have it, they are pressing deeper into Eritrea, denying with every step that they plan any long-term invasion of their neighbor and once-tight ally.</p>
        <p>''We have no intentions, no plans, no need to occupy Eritrea,'' an Ethiopian commander, Col. Gabre Kidane, said tonight as he stood on the old Italian fortress in this hilly town 45 miles inside Eritrea. ''The only intention we have is to weaken the forces that have occupied our country and to regain our sovereignty. That is all.''</p>
        <p>A week after Ethiopia started an offensive that it says is aimed at ending the two-year-old war, it is now clear that the whole of Eritrea could become a battlefield. With hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing the region, Colonel Kidane said Ethiopian soldiers continued to skirmish with Eritrean soldiers on the run here in western Eritrea.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Ethiopian officials said planes bombed the main Eritrean military training center at Sawa, an American-built base 100 miles west of Asmara, the capital. The officials also said they had taken a village, Maidema, 30 miles from Asmara, on the way from the western front to the central front along the disputed border. That is where the next round of fighting, already heavy, is generally expected.</p>
        <p>For Eritrea, Ethiopia's rapid advance out of the border trenches into the countryside is not merely a military setback. For 30 years, when Eritrea was the northernmost province of Ethiopia, rebels fought two successive governments in Addis Ababa for their independence. Those rebels, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, now are in power in Eritrea, and they say this advance is a frightening continuation of Ethiopia's attempts at domination.</p>
        <p>An Eritrean government statement said today that a bombing on Thursday south of the port of Massawa killed a civilian. That death, the statement said, was ''further evidence of Ethiopia's resurgent aim to annex this country and, in so doing, to make targets of Eritrea's civilian populations.''</p>
        <p>Ethiopia said the target was a military installation.</p>
        <p>The paradox is that the leaders of Ethiopia fought side by side with the Eritreans to oust the military government of Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. For the first few years, the two governments were close friends, so close that they never demarcated the border when Eritrea became independent in 1993.</p>
        <p>But tensions grew over personality clashes and economic rivalry, exploding in May 1998 when Eritrea claimed the Badme border region based on old colonial maps. Eritrea moved troops into the area.</p>
        <p>Ethiopia said it was invaded, and a war ignited that has defied long peace talks and claimed tens of thousands of lives on both sides.</p>
        <p>Until Ethiopia began its offensive last Friday, the fighting had been confined to three fronts along the 620-mile border. But since then, Ethiopia has pressed 65 miles into Eritrea, displacing 340,000 people, the World Food Program said today.</p>
        <p>Officials in neighboring Sudan said today that an additional 50,000 Eritreans had fled across their border. In both places, relief officials said, people lack food and shelter. Even without the war, the United Nations says 800,000 Eritreans face food shortages because of drought.</p>
        <p>Most civilians fled from around this town, the regional capital and a strategically important point because the area was a main supply route for Eritrea's westernmost front.</p>
        <p>The battle has been intense. Starting on Monday, Colonel Kidane said, Ethiopian troops had pounded areas around the town with bombs, tanks and artillery and then engaged Eritrean troops along a mountain pass eight miles from town.</p>
        <p>Along the heavily mined road from the south, the route of Ethiopia's advance, huge numbers of empty mortar shells, captured Eritrean ammunition and destroyed trucks from both sides remain. At spots, the smell of rotting corpses was strong. Colonel Kidane would not give the number of casualties.</p>
        <p>On Thursday morning, Ethiopian troops took the town, the biggest one that they have captured, and called it a major victory. The Eritreans said they had staged a tactical withdrawal.</p>
        <p>This evening, Ethiopian troops milled around and ate their rations at the hilltop building that was once a fortress for Italian troops in the colonial period and that, until Thursday, according to the Ethiopians, was the command center for Eritrean troops in the region. The Ethiopians joked about marching on to Asmara.</p>
        <p>''It's nice to take the place of the invading army,'' said an Ethiopian soldier, Seife Yechenku, 21, who has fought in the army since the war began. ''There is no question I am very happy.''</p>
