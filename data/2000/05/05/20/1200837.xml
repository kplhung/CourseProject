        <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against a chemical manufacturer on behalf of up to 35,000 people who drank water contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals from public wells in Toms River, N.J., during the 1960's and 1970's.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A class-action lawsuit has been filed against a chemical manufacturer on behalf of up to 35,000 people who drank water contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals from public wells in Toms River, N.J., during the 1960's and 1970's.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed on Thursday in Superior Court in Ocean County  against the Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation, formerly the Ciba-Geigy Corporation, which owned a Toms River chemical manufacturing plant, now closed. Three people were named as representatives of the class.</p>
        <p>The suit is the first to be filed in the investigation of possible links between pollution at the 1,400-acre Ciba-Geigy plant and nearby Reich Farm, both of which have been named Superfund sites. Many residents blame pollution from the two sites for a higher-than-normal incidence of childhood cancers that has been documented in the area.</p>
        <p>People who lived in the area and drank water from the wells but have not developed cancer are represented in the class action, said Michael Gordon of West Orange, N.J., one of the lawyers who filed the suit. People with cancer who think the water pollution may have caused their illness may file suit separately, he said.</p>
        <p>The suit cites a Feb. 29 report by state and federal health investigators, which concluded that residents of Toms River in 1965 and 1966 may have been exposed to carcinogenic dyes and nitrobenzene from the Ciba-Geigy Corporation that seeped into three wells used by what is now known as United Water Toms River. The wells are now closed.</p>
        <p>The class action asks Ciba Specialty Chemicals, which is based in Switzerland, to pay damages and to pay for yearly medical monitoring for the plaintiffs. In New Jersey, damage amounts are not named in lawsuits, but medical monitoring alone could run into millions of dollars, Mr. Gordon said.</p>
        <p>''Ciba-Geigy does not believe any public water was impacted except for a brief period in 1965,'' said Michael Rodburg, a lawyer in Roseland, N.J., who is representing the company. The company has cooperated with every investigating agency and with the residents in efforts to trace and identify groundwater contamination, he said.</p>
        <p>In addition, 60 families have agreed not to sue Ciba-Geigy, United Water Toms River or Union Carbide, the source of contaminants dumped illegally at Reich Farm, as long as information is being exchanged by all sides.</p>
        <p>The class-action suit should not jeopardize that agreement, Mr. Rodburg said.</p>
