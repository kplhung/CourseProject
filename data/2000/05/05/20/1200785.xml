        <p>Ariane Anthony took on Wallace Stevens and Samuel Beckett in ''Why Imagine Golden Birds?,'' a program of new and recent dances Ms. Anthony presented on Monday night at the Construction Company studio. Stevens is one of the least corporeal and most metaphorical of poets, with Beckett not far behind. But Ms. Anthony is a young choreographer of rare imagination and sureness. The dark iconic birds and coolly charged landscapes of Stevens's ''Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird'' came alive in purely physical terms, as did Beckett's ''man who saw himself rise and go'' in the prose poem ''Stirrings Still.''</p>
        <p>The evening's dedication, to the memory of Edward Gorey and Anna Sokolow, says much about Ms. Anthony's work, which merges the untethered fantasy of Gorey's drawn world with the unerring emotional accuracy of the best of Sokolow's dance plays. In her new ''Seeing I,'' the Beckett dance, a trio of drab men (Peter Campbell, Jackson Kent and Brendan McCall) sit, rise and move about a small space in a Magritte-like triplicate image of a single man dressed in brown trousers, suspenders, white shirt and brown shoes.</p>

        <p>Ariane Anthony took on Wallace Stevens and Samuel Beckett in ''Why Imagine Golden Birds?,'' a program of new and recent dances Ms. Anthony presented on Monday night at the Construction Company studio. Stevens is one of the least corporeal and most metaphorical of poets, with Beckett not far behind. But Ms. Anthony is a young choreographer of rare imagination and sureness. The dark iconic birds and coolly charged landscapes of Stevens's ''Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird'' came alive in purely physical terms, as did Beckett's ''man who saw himself rise and go'' in the prose poem ''Stirrings Still.''</p>
        <p>The evening's dedication, to the memory of Edward Gorey and Anna Sokolow, says much about Ms. Anthony's work, which merges the untethered fantasy of Gorey's drawn world with the unerring emotional accuracy of the best of Sokolow's dance plays. In her new ''Seeing I,'' the Beckett dance, a trio of drab men (Peter Campbell, Jackson Kent and Brendan McCall) sit, rise and move about a small space in a Magritte-like triplicate image of a single man dressed in brown trousers, suspenders, white shirt and brown shoes.</p>
        <p>Equally drab wooden chairs and a table appear and disappear in this suite of vignettes separated by blackouts. One man has a brief, quizzical encounter with a red rose. At another point Ms. Anthony deftly shifts perspective so that the audience seems to be looking down on the dancers. The overall effect is of a silent movie made into a dance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Anthony has chosen her collaborators well. Both ''Seeing I'' and her new ''Why Imagine Golden Birds?,'' the Stevens dance, are set to scores by John Stone that have all the quiet eccentricity and evocativeness of the choreography. (Mr. Stone also played the piano in musical interludes, with Jolle Greenleaf singing his songs.) Peter Wahlberg's set designs, which include projections of stark yet lyrical photographic skies and winter trees in ''Golden Birds,'' send the everyday into eerie orbit with all the mad logic of the dances.</p>
        <p>Christopher Fields, the costume designer for both pieces, does extraordinary things with dull little hats and black and white fabrics whose textures match the variety of ''Golden Bird.'' Sarah Sidman's subtly dramatic lighting enhances the pieces' look of small universes complete in themselves. And the skillful dancers -- in ''Golden Bird,'' Ms. Anthony, Amit Hadari, Natalie Desch, Andrea Thome, Mr. McCall and Mr. Kent -- are as quietly eccentric looking as the choreography.</p>
        <p>Ms. Anthony uses everything from simple calligraphic figures to a small crowd-buffeted woman and stylish young waltzers to embody, but not illustrate, Stevens's poem. One image is more startling than the next, but one never loses the sense of the poem's sere and solitary splendor. Hers is a gift to be cherished.</p>
