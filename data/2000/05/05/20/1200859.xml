        <p>Rain pattered on the wide tent as 33 Brooklyn sixth graders from Public School 93 in Bedford-Stuyvesant sat quietly in rows, waiting for their big moment. After a seemingly endless list of names, it finally came. They jumped out of their seats and cheered, clapped and waved toward the podium.</p>
        <p>Their teacher, Verone H. Kennedy, had just graduated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy, who was awarded a master's of science in education, was one of 120 graduate students and 279 undergraduates to receive their degrees yesterday at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>Opening the ceremony, Michele Tolela Myers, the president of the 72-year-old college, praised it as a tightly knit community ''where being humane is as important as being smart'' and called upon the graduates to stand up and give their parents ''the applause they deserve.''.</p>
        <p>W. Ian Lipkin, a microbiologist who discovered the West Nile virus last year, made history again by being the first male Sarah Lawrence graduate to give a commencement address there.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Dr. Lipkin, a 1974 graduate, cited the classic advice given to Dustin Hoffman in the 1967 film ''The Graduate.'' Noting that ''plastics,'' the one-word piece of counsel given in the film, was meant in a pejorative way, he said, ''I will use the word in its original sense, as an adjective implying the capacity to be molded or the ability to create.''</p>
        <p>He said studying liberal arts at Sarah Lawrence ''encouraged me to take on projects and risks others thought undoable.''</p>
        <p>Marni Beth Schwartz, a co-president of the class of 2000, elicited hearty laughter with her solemn words of wisdom: ''Look in the outer boroughs. You are not going to find an apartment for under $1,000 in Manhattan. Really.''</p>
        <p>Among those receiving bachelor's degrees were Christina Pascarelli, a 35-year-old mother of two who is heading Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign in Putnam County, and  Clay Chapman, 22, who learned last week that he had been given a two-book contract from Hyperion Books.</p>
        <p>''If you want to talk about graduation presents, this is amazing,'' Mr. Chapman said. Most graduates returned to their seats after receiving their diplomas, but Mr. Kennedy, the teacher, walked straight over to his beaming sixth graders for a triumphant round of hand-slapping.</p>
        <p>''He wanted us to come so much,'' said Susan McFarland, 11, who added that she hoped to be a teacher one day. ''He wanted us to see how it was going to be for us. He tells us it's good to go to college.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy, 34, a Brooklyn native who has been a teacher for 11 years, said he had planned all year to bring his students to his graduation. ''So many kids in the inner city hear about graduations, they see them on TV, but they never get to go to them,'' he said. ''This is something concrete that they can see.''</p>
        <p>Juilliard School</p>
        <p>Some 220 aspiring artists received graduate and undergraduate degrees in music, drama and dance from the Juilliard School yesterday at Alice Tully Hall at the school's 95th commencement ceremony.</p>
        <p>Recipients of honorary degrees were Jacques d'Amboise, founder of the National Dance Institute; Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York; James Levine, artistic director of the Metropolitan Opera; the actor Kevin Spacey; and the soprano Barbara Hendricks.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hendricks, who is a Juilliard graduate, delivered the commencement address, telling students that Julliard changed her life. She had been studying math and chemistry when a Juilliard teacher inspired her to become an artist.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hendricks also challenged students to ''be daring, take risks and maintain the legacy of art and artist who have come before you.'' She added, ''Art should not be used only as a showcase for tourists, but should be the heart and soul of the community and thereby participate in the enrichment of the lives of all.''</p>
        <p>Joseph W. Polisi, Juilliard's president, characterized the graduating class as talented, disciplined and ready to take up Ms. Hendricks's challenge. ''They will make their mark,'' he predicted, ''and today we celebrate them.''</p>
