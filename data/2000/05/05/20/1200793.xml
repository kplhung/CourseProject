        <p>Vladimir Feltsman has an extraordinary talent for recreating himself -- or at least, for toppling the expectations of listeners who think they have him figured out. When he came to the United States in 1987, in a blaze of publicity centering on his long fight to be allowed to leave the Soviet Union, he was encouraged to focus on the Russian repertory, apparently on the theory that this is what Russian pianists are meant to do.</p>
        <p>He played that music with a certain splashy grandeur, but complained from the start that he was being unfairly typecast. His real interest, he said, was the Germanic classics, and about a decade ago, he decided to stray about as far from Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev as a pianist can go: he undertook a bold, inventive series of Bach concerts and recordings that showed his pianism in an entirely different light.</p>

        <p>Vladimir Feltsman has an extraordinary talent for recreating himself -- or at least, for toppling the expectations of listeners who think they have him figured out. When he came to the United States in 1987, in a blaze of publicity centering on his long fight to be allowed to leave the Soviet Union, he was encouraged to focus on the Russian repertory, apparently on the theory that this is what Russian pianists are meant to do.</p>
        <p>He played that music with a certain splashy grandeur, but complained from the start that he was being unfairly typecast. His real interest, he said, was the Germanic classics, and about a decade ago, he decided to stray about as far from Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev as a pianist can go: he undertook a bold, inventive series of Bach concerts and recordings that showed his pianism in an entirely different light.</p>
        <p>For his recital at the 92nd Street Y  last Saturday evening, Mr. Feltsman moved to ground somewhere between Bach and the virtuoso Russians. On the first half of the program he gave forceful, bright-edged accounts of Haydn's Sonata in E flat (Hob. XVI:49) and Brahms's ''Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Handel.'' He devoted the second half of the concert to Chopin, which in a certain way brought the American part of his career full circle: it was through a recording of a Chopin recital in Moscow that most Americans first heard him.</p>
        <p>The most pleasing aspect of Mr. Feltsman's performance was the personalization he brought to each of the works, or to put it differently, his refusal to adopt what has become the agreed-upon interpretive norm. His Haydn, like his Bach, bristled with a muscular energy that took the form of brisk tempos and sharply defined articulation. Yet there was flexibility as well, evident both in the sustained pauses in the opening Allegro non troppo and in the lighter touch that Mr. Feltsman brought to much of the Adagio cantabile.</p>
        <p>The Brahms Handel Variations began in much the same spirit. As in the Haydn, Mr. Feltsman used only the lightest pedaling in the aria, and he kept the textures transparent and the ornamentation crisp. But as the variations flowed he drew on the piano's full spectrum of timbre and volume, moving between the delicate and the thunderous without seeming to be exaggerating either.</p>
        <p>In his Chopin -- the Polonaises in C sharp minor and E flat minor (Op. 26, Nos. 1 and 2), the Barcarolle (Op. 60) and the Ballade No. 4 (Op. 52) -- he offered an overview of Chopin's range, from the drama of the minor-key Polonaises to the poetry of the Ballade. Mainly, this was highly rational Chopin -- poetic, beautiful and warm, but free of the swooning rubato that many pianists bring to it.</p>
