        <p>Open positions of short sales on the New York Stock Exchange rose 4.4 percent in the most recent monthly period, the stock exchange reported yesterday.</p>
        <p>Uncovered short sales totaled 4.23 billion shares for the month ended May 15, compared with 4.05 billion in the previous month. The short interest was equal to 1.4 percent of the total shares listed on the Big Board.</p>
        <p>On the smaller American Stock Exchange, uncovered short sales rose 2.2 percent, the exchange, which is owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers, announced separately. Short sales totaled 197.9 million shares, up from a revised total of 193.7 million shares the month earlier.</p>
        <p>In a short sale, an investor borrows shares from a brokerage firm and sells them, hoping to buy them back at lower prices and make a profit. If the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces a loss.</p>
        <p>Uncovered short sales -- or those with open positions -- are shares that have been borrowed and sold, but not yet covered by repurchase.</p>
        <p>Large short-sale positions have long been considered an indicator of bearish sentiment among investors. But the level of short interest can fluctuate as a result of complex trading strategies involving options, futures and derivatives.</p>
