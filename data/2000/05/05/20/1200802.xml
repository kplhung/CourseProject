        <p>GERMANY: COMPENSATION FOR NAZIS' SLAVES -- The upper house of Parliament unanimously approved a bill that would provide Nazi-era slave laborers with $4.6 billion in compensation. The legislation now goes to the lower house. American and German officials hope to work out the unresolved issues -- like calls by German companies for immunity from future claims -- before President Clinton arrives in early June to sign an accord with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: AN AUSCHWITZ SETTLEMENT -- The government reached a settlement with a brother and a sister whose parents died in Auschwitz after the family was deported from Switzerland in 1942, the first such voluntary payment by Switzerland. The Finance Ministry and the lawyer for the two, Charles and Sabine Sonabend, said Switzerland had agreed to pay 200,000 Swiss francs ($115,100). The Sonabends withdrew lawsuits seeking compensation.</p>

        <p>CROATIA: 11 SERBS GUILTY OF WAR CRIMES -- A court in Vukovar found 11 Croatian Serbs guilty of war crimes, the HINA news agency reported. Twenty-two Serbs had been indicted, of whom 21 were tried in absentia for genocide and war crimes against civilians during the Serbian siege of Vukovar in 1991. The court rejected the accusations of genocide, HINA said. The sentences range from 3 to 20 years.</p>

        <p>BELARUS: EX-PREMIER SENTENCED -- A court sentenced Mikhail Chigir, a former prime minister and leading opposition figure, to three years in prison, suspended for two years, for abuse of power, and thus barred him from coming elections. A judge at Minsk Municipal Court said Mr. Chigir's favoritism toward a company had caused damage to the state, and also ordered him to pay $209,000 in damages, a huge sum in impoverished Belarus.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: EXTENSION ON CHEMICAL WEAPONS -- The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has given Russia until April 2002 to begin destroying its 40,000-ton arsenal of chemical weapons. The first 1 percent was to have been destroyed last month. Now, 20 percent is to be destroyed by April 2002. Russia holds the world's largest stockpile, followed by the United States, which has destroyed 17 percent of its 32,000 tons.</p>

        <p>THE NETHERLANDS: FIREWORKS OWNERS HELD -- The police arrested an owner of the fireworks factory that exploded last weekend, killing at least 17. The man, W. Pater, turned himself in. The authorities had issued a warrant for Mr. Pater and his partner, R. Bakker, on suspicion that they had broken regulations for storing fireworks. Arson is also suspected.</p>

        <p>ITALY: SOCCER 'PEACE MATCH' -- Palestinian and Israeli soccer players plan to play together against a team of Italian pop stars in Rome on Thursday. The idea came from Archbishop Pietro Sambi, the papal nuncio in Israel, who has contacts in Italian show business. Uri Savir, the Israeli organizer, said: ''Palestinians and Israelis have never competed against each other, at least not in soccer. It is no small matter that they will play on the same team.''</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: NEW HOSTAGE TALKS -- Malaysia is trying to break the impasse in efforts to free 21 hostages held by rebels in the southern Philippines after talks between negotiators and the captors stalled. The Malaysian ambassador, Muhammad Arshad Manzoor Hussain, met four commanders of the rebel group Thursday, and though their demands were unclear, no ransom demands were made. The 21 hostages -- nine Malaysians, three Germans, two French citizens, two Finns, two South Africans, two Filipinos and a Lebanese -- were kidnapped at Malaysian resort across the sea border on April 23.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: STRIKES HALT BUSINESS -- Commerce was shut down in all major cities by twin strikes, one called by business people protesting the military government's efforts to impose new taxes, the other led by religious political parties angry over the killing of Muhammad Yusuf Ludhianvi, a prominent Muslim scholar.</p>

        <p>CANADA: VAST PERSONAL DATABASE -- The privacy commissioner, Bruce Phillips, disclosed that the government has compiled a database on 33 million Canadians, living and dead. The Longitudinal Labor Force File contains up to 2,000 pieces of information on each subject, including ethnicity, education, travel, marital status, disabilities and tax and employment details. In the face of opposition criticism, Jane Stewart, whose ministry, Human Resources, maintains the database, said in Parliament, ''There is limited access and the information is secure.''</p>

        <p>CANADA: SEARCH FOR LOST JEWELS -- Lloyd's of London plans to use a small submarine this summer to vacuum the ocean floor near Halifax, Nova Scotia, where a Swissair jet carrying $200 million in diamonds and jewels crashed in 1998. In the crash, which killed all 229 people aboard, a Picasso painting worth about $35 million was destroyed, and a stainless tube packed with 4 pounds of diamonds and 11 pounds of jewels was lost. Lyn Romano, whose husband was killed in the crash, denounced the plan, adding, ''Their little suction adventure to recover their precious gems may recover something a little bit more precious to me.''</p>

        <p>UGANDA: REBEL LEADERS CAPTURED -- The army ambushed a group of rebels in eastern Congo, capturing five commanders of the Allied Democratic Forces, according to the army spokesman, Capt. Shaban Bantariza. Those captured included Bwambale Ali, the top commander, and two officers identified as Junju and Bilambala. The ambush came less than a month after the rebel chief, Mansur Arinaitwe, surrendered to Ugandan troops in Congo. The Allied Democratic Forces have been fighting since 1996 to oust President Yoweri Museveni.</p>

        <p>MALAWI: ELECTION CONFIRMED -- The High Court upheld the electoral commission's declaration that President Bakili Muluzi was the lawful winner of last year's election. Judge Isaac Mtambo said, ''Muluzi satisfied the constitutional requirement, and he won by a majority of the electorate who voted.'' The opposition had challenged the commission's declaration and said that there was evidence of vote-rigging in the election, in which Mr. Muluzi claimed 51 percent of the vote.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: BAIL REFUSED FOR GENERAL -- A court in Lagos refused bail to a former army chief, Ishaya Bamaiyi, arguing that if released, he could seek to influence witnesses in his trial for attempted murder. Mr. Bamaiyi, who was army chief of staff under the late military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, is charged with trying to kill a former internal affairs minister and publisher, Alex Ibru, in February 1996.</p>

        <p>TANZANIA: CANDIDATES IN ZANZIBAR -- The chief minister in the semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, Muhammad Gharib Bilal, joined the race to be president in elections on Oct. 29.

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: BAN ON PLASTIC BAGS -- The government plans to ban plastic bags, said the environment and tourism minister, Valli Moosa. A bill to ban the bags --a common form of litter -- is due next week.
