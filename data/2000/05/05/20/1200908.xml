        <p>When asked about their mayor yesterday, New Yorkers were as rambunctious as the political landscape itself.</p>
        <p>In train stations and on street corners, in cafes and pizzerias, there was little agreement about the motives and character of the man who stood before supporters yesterday and announced -- with notable emotion -- that he would not continue his run for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Some scoffed at his personal statements, describing him as ''tyrannical'' and ''selfish''; others described him as ''truthful'' and ''human.''</p>
        <p>Only one thing seemed to hurt New Yorkers uniformly: the end of what had promised to be a rousing political brawl between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to see the knockdown, mud-slinging campaign,'' said Josh Cianciolo, 27, who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Staying on the knockdown theme, he added: ''My vote is up for grabs. Jump ball.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Paliferro, 35, a construction worker who had just finished driving piles at a construction site at Cadman Plaza in Brooklyn, also bemoaned the end of a fight, and the repose of the fighter. ''Rudy fought everything-- crime, pollution, the museums, the go-go clubs, the media, whatever --that's what he did, fight,'' he said. ''I just can't believe he's not going to fight Hillary now.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Paliferro, who lives in Babylon on Long Island, acknowledged that a host of other problems -- like cancer and the breakdown of a marriage -- can drain a man's fighting spirit.</p>
        <p>In a city that likes its politics rough, others refused to give the mayor a free pass for such problems, saying his declared intentions to build bridges between minority residents and City Hall were too little, too late.</p>
        <p>Repeatedly, they cited the mayor's harsh statements about Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed man who was shot to death in a scuffle with police, and his stinging announcement of his intention to separate from his wife, as more revealing of the real Rudy.</p>
        <p>In Cadman Park, Michael Charkey, a 57-year-old former token clerk from East New York, scoffed at the mayor's new-found sentimentality.  ''Reach out to everyone?'' he snorted in disbelief. ''It took him getting cancer to figure out he had to reach out to everyone? It took his own life being in jeopardy.''</p>
        <p>To some, Mr. Giuliani's admission  of some error in the handling of the Dorismond case did not alter the fact that he was someone who always had to get his own way. ''Rudy wants what Rudy wants,'' Mr. Charkey said. ''Now he wants to be loved. So he's going to do what it takes to be loved.''</p>
        <p>In Taylor's, a coffee shop on West 18th Street in Manhattan, one woman who said she was a literary agent but declined to give her name observed that when the mayor admitted fault, she guessed that he would not be seeking higher office. ''For the first time in my memory, he made an admission that he was wrong, and for the first time he let down his shield.''</p>
        <p>Another woman there, Brinda Maira, who works for a nonprofit corporation that trains women for the construction industry, said his announcement did not surprise her, just as nothing he said would. ''It doesn't surprise me at all that he was jerking people around,'' she said.  ''He takes inappropriateness to a whole new level.''</p>
        <p>Others said, however, that the shocking confluence of events in the last months had plunged the mayor into real personal pain, and that had actually softened him. ''He suddenly became human,'' said Quentin Arthur, a 24-year-old law student who was standing outside the federal courthouse in Brooklyn. ''It's like tragedy had to strike before he could see what he was like. I don't think it's an act. I think he really probably does want to be a better person.''</p>
        <p>Some were less interested in the politics of the mayor's personal transformation, and were focused, instead, on the outcome of the Senate race. They played with the phrase ''Senator Clinton,'' giving scant thought to the Long Island Republican, Rick Lazio, who expressed his intention yesterday to run in Mr. Giuliani's place.</p>
        <p>''Yeah, Rick Lazio -- I just heard him mentioned on TV,'' said Mike Jabloski, a 25-year-old securities trader from Huntington on Long Island. ''He's from the Bronx, right?''</p>
