        <p>Mike Jarvis will board a plane today for Florida and the Big East Conference coaching meetings. For now, he remains the basketball coach of St. John's and not the new head coach of the Washington Wizards.</p>
        <p>Jarvis said his agent, Robert Ades, was gathering information about whether Michael Jordan wanted to offer Jarvis a job with the Wizards, giving him an opportunity to return to the city where he coached George Washington University.</p>
        <p>Neither Ades nor Jarvis had heard from Jordan as of early last night as the talks seemed to be losing momentum.</p>
        <p>Jarvis reiterated that he was not sure if he was the top choice of the Wizards, adding that if he did receive an offer it would not be a foregone conclusion that he would accept it.</p>
        <p>''There's absolutely nothing to report,'' Jarvis said. ''I haven't talked to Michael Jordan today.''</p>
