        <p>First we hated her for marrying Paul. She wasn't beautiful enough; she wasn't famous; she was American, for heaven's sake. Later we hated her for breaking up the Beatles (with Yoko's help), then joining her husband's new band when it was clear she couldn't sing, and wasn't she just a little too self-righteous about those vegetarian cookbooks and her work in animal rights? Then, two years ago last month, she died of breast cancer at the age of 56 and we made her a saint.</p>
        <p>Now Linda McCartney is the heroine of the baby boomers' new favorite love story. She and Paul McCartney were destined to be together and incredibly happy every moment of their 29-year marriage, you know. And he couldn't have cheated because they never spent a night apart (except for his six days in a Japanese jail in 1980 for marijuana possession). Proving that true love really does exist and that even the wildest, cutest, most happily promiscuous young rock star really just wants a farm in Scotland and four children and a good woman by his side. That kind of mythology is the use we make of famous people's lives, and then we make television movies about them.</p>

        <p>Now Linda McCartney is the heroine of the baby boomers' new favorite love story. She and Paul McCartney were destined to be together and incredibly happy every moment of their 29-year marriage, you know. And he couldn't have cheated because they never spent a night apart (except for his six days in a Japanese jail in 1980 for marijuana possession). Proving that true love really does exist and that even the wildest, cutest, most happily promiscuous young rock star really just wants a farm in Scotland and four children and a good woman by his side. That kind of mythology is the use we make of famous people's lives, and then we make television movies about them.</p>
        <p>The one the former Linda Eastman has gotten, ''The Linda McCartney Story,'' which has its premiere tomorrow night at 9 on CBS, is a typical celebrity biography. It's far less than a saint deserves, but at least Elizabeth Mitchell plays her with intelligence and charm.</p>
        <p>As the film tells it, the story begins when Linda's photography career does. She's a pretty, blond 24-year-old divorcee with a 4-year-old daughter, Heather, living in New York and working in a very low-level job at City and Village magazine (in real life, Town and Country, as you might guess). One day she and an equally young, hip co-worker grab a press party invitation for a get-together with the Rolling Stones on a yacht. Linda takes her camera, catches Mick Jagger's eye and gets some nice pictures.</p>
        <p>She soon has a book contract and uses her advance to travel, among other places, to London, where she catches the eye of Paul McCartney (Gary Bakewell) at a club. (In between, she has also caught Jim Morrison's eye at an American club. Linda's legend is that this was always happening to her.) While in London, she's invited to a press lunch for the ''Sgt. Pepper'' album at Brian Epstein's house and simultaneously snaps pictures of Paul and charms  the socks off him. This is not the finest hour of Christine Berardo's script. Linda asks about the new album's title. Paul explains: ''Well, you know those little packets you get on airplanes. Someone said to me, 'Would you pass me the salt and pepper?' I thought, 'Salt and pepper -- Sergeant Pepper. It's a bit of a pun, that's all. Playing with words.'' Linda can only reply, ''What a mind!''</p>
        <p>The dialogue is better at times. Later a friend -- Danny Fields (David Lewis), on whose biography the film is based -- reminds Linda that Paul has been living with the British actress Jane Asher for five years. ''He'll never marry her,'' Linda says confidently. Danny replies, ''Has he asked you?'' She smiles again and says, ''He doesn't have my number.''</p>
        <p>Luckily she soon finds herself at a Beatles press conference and passes Paul a piece of paper with her telephone number on it. The next thing you know, her answering service is reporting that Paul McCartney of London called: ''He's on his way to Los Angeles. He'd like you to meet him there at the Beverly Hills Hotel.'' She goes, arrives at his bungalow and the two are undressing each other before he has even asked if she had a nice flight.</p>
        <p>It's good to know that late-20th-century saints are allowed to have slept around. Mick Jagger (Matthew Harrison) blatantly propositions Linda in the yacht scene, and although we don't see their sexual liaison she acknowledges later that it took place. She is also seen in bed with Morrison (Aaron Grain).</p>
        <p>Maybe film producers should give up the idea of look-alike casting. At times, Mr. Bakewell, who has played Mr. McCartney before, in the 1994 film ''Backbeat,'' looks more like Donny Osmond -- although that improves as the character ages. On the other hand, Tim Piper is thrilling as a dead ringer for John Lennon, but he has a lot fewer scenes.</p>
        <p>Beatles fans should not expect even re-creations of the group's music. All they'll hear is a snippet of ''I Want to Hold Your Hand,'' played over film of the group's famous Shea Stadium concert. ''Along Comes Mary,'' by the Association, is the theme music for Paul and Linda's picturesque New York wanderings, and ''Never, My Love'' plays over the scenes of Paul's final, successful marriage proposal and the couple's 1969 London wedding.</p>
        <p>Once Linda and Paul are married, and it's established that his fans despise her, ''The Linda McCartney Story'' makes the inevitable transition into disease film. The situation has already been set up with one reverse flashback to her diagnosis, and Paul has told her earlier that his mother died of breast cancer when he was 14. The film now jumps back and forth in time, juxtaposing hospital scenes with accounts of Paul's depression after the Beatles' breakup, Linda's reluctance to be a part of Wings (''You don't need a total amateur onstage with you''), the couple's surprise Christmas visit to the Lennons in New York and the horrifying news of Lennon's murder.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell elevates her own scenes of illness, deterioration and death with an admirable dignity. Throughout the film, George Segal is also good (with less than brilliant material) as Linda's father, Lee Eastman, who becomes the lawyer for the Beatles' troubled company Apple. In the end, though, the film is just another tear-jerker. Any fan who really wants to pay tribute to Linda and Paul McCartney's life together might do better to get out the ''McCartney'' album and play ''Maybe I'm Amazed'' once or twice.</p>
