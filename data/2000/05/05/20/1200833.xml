        <p>Ridley Scott, the director of ''Gladiator,'' the No. 1 movie at the box office, has apologized for a trade publication advertisement that has heightened tensions in a three-week-old actors' strike. The advertisement depicted the bare breasts of a black woman.</p>
        <p>Appearing in Shoot, a weekly magazine of the advertising industry, the advertisement stated that Marcus Nispel, a prominent director of commercials, was setting up a temporary office in South Africa -- out of reach of the striking Screen Actors Guild.

        <p>Ridley Scott, the director of ''Gladiator,'' the No. 1 movie at the box office, has apologized for a trade publication advertisement that has heightened tensions in a three-week-old actors' strike. The advertisement depicted the bare breasts of a black woman.</p>
        <p>Appearing in Shoot, a weekly magazine of the advertising industry, the advertisement stated that Marcus Nispel, a prominent director of commercials, was setting up a temporary office in South Africa -- out of reach of the striking Screen Actors Guild. Mr. Nispel works for RSA U.S.A., a commercial production agency owned by Mr. Scott and his brother, Tony Scott, the director of the movie ''Top Gun'' and the current film ''Where the Money Is.''</p>
        <p>The strike against the advertising industry by members of the Screen Actors Guild, known as SAG, and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists began on May 1. Some 135,000 actors belong to the unions.</p>
        <p>In the advertisement, under the picture of an aging woman's pendulous breasts, the text read: ''In South Africa, this is what SAG means.''</p>
        <p>Outrage over the advertisement prompted actors and representatives of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to protest in front of RSA's offices in West Hollywood on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Anne-Marie Johnson, a television and film actor who chairs the equal employment opportunity committee for the screen actors, said the advertisement showed ''the lengths that certain companies will go to attract nonunion work.''</p>
        <p>''This company felt very comfortable using racism, ageism, and sexism to promote business and to attract advertisers,'' Ms. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>After the protest, the Scott brothers apologized for a ''huge mistake'' by their employees.</p>
        <p>''We knew absolutely nothing about this advertisement,'' they said in a statement, ''and are as upset, sickened and appalled by this situation as anyone else.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Johnson pointed out that the Scotts had waited three days after the advertisement had appeared to express their regret. ''I think they apologized too late,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The Association of National Advertisers and the American Association of Advertising Agencies disavowed the advertisement, saying it did not represent the industry's views.</p>
        <p>The Association of Independent Commercial Producers, the largest trade organization for the television commercial production industry, blamed the tensions caused by the strike for the advertisement.</p>
        <p>The president of the association, Matt Miller, said: ''Commercial producers are in a position where they need to work. We're in a time right now where emotions are running very high.''</p>
        <p>The central issue in the strike is how to pay actors for their work in commercials. The actors want to be paid each time a commercial is shown on network television and want to extend that practice to cable television. Advertisers want to replace ''pay for play'' with a flat one-time-only fee for both network and cable spots.</p>
