        <p>The daring attempt to depose the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly sputtered today as the man who orchestrated it acknowledged that his base of support had seriously eroded.</p>
        <p>The leader of the insurrection, Assemblyman Michael J. Bragman, who represents the Syracuse area, said that the ''rock solid'' backing he once had in his bid to replace the speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, had dwindled in the face of threats and retaliation by Mr. Silver and his powerful allies.</p>
        <p>But at the same time, Mr. Bragman vowed to press ahead with his campaign to oust Mr. Silver, who he said had an autocratic and secretive style that had alienated many of the 98 Democrats who make up the majority party in the Assembly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman said he believed that there was enough dissatisfaction with the speaker to topple him. ''Am I still in a position to win? I don't know,'' he said. ''But you know what? There is going to be change here. Sheldon Silver must go as the speaker of the New York State Assembly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman also ruled out the possibility that he would seek support from Assembly Republicans to become speaker, a prospect that would have thrown the chamber into disarray.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman needs the support of at least 50 Democrats to oust Mr. Silver. But even if he cannot muster that many votes, he can still create huge headaches for the speaker. Mr. Silver needs a sizable majority to control legislation as tightly as he does now, and a faction of Democrats led by Mr. Bragman might make that difficult, if not impossible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman made his comments two days after he threw the chamber into turmoil with his announcement that he would try to overthrow Mr. Silver in a showdown vote on Monday. Mr. Silver immediately stripped Mr. Bragman of his position as majority leader, cut his $34,500-a-year stipend and even had him locked out of his office here in the State Capitol.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman, who has been in the Assembly since 1981, represents a huge threat to Mr. Silver. Mr. Bragman is a formidable fund-raiser with broad support among moderates, conservatives and liberals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver has not taken the threat lightly, using all the powers at his disposal to beat back the insurrection. He has punished rebellious lawmakers and secured the help of powerful union officials and influential party leaders to solidify his support.</p>
        <p>He demoted two high-ranking lawmakers who pledged their loyalty to Mr. Bragman and then cut their annual pay by $12,500 each. The raw display of power immediately placed other lawmakers on notice that they would meet the same fate if they crossed Mr. Silver.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver's furious maneuvering over the last 48 hours seems to be paying off. He has won the backing of key New York City Assembly Democrats whose support is crucial if he is to maintain power.</p>
        <p>The Silver loyalists include Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Democratic leader in Manhattan; Clarence Norman Jr., the Democratic leader in Brooklyn; and Roberto Ramirez, the Democratic leader in the Bronx. The borough delegations that these men lead represent more than 40 members of the Assembly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver was trying to negotiate today with Thomas J. Manton, the Queens Democratic leader, to secure the support of all 16 Assembly members from that borough. Mr. Manton has had a continuing feud with Mr. Silver, and he recently offered to deliver most of the borough's Assembly members to Mr. Bragman provided Mr. Bragman moved quickly to depose Mr. Silver.</p>
        <p>The ouster of a speaker is an uncommon occurrence -- the last attempt in the Assembly was in the 1960's -- and Mr. Bragman's comments today were widely interpreted as an admission of defeat. But he may have achieved something that is almost as extraordinary as toppling a legislative leader: he may have seriously wounded Mr. Silver.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman seemed to be hinting at such a prospect today. ''I think something extraordinarily positive has already come out of this,'' he told reporters, noting that he had the support of at least 40 Democrats who were frustrated with Mr. Silver. ''It is my intention to go in on Monday and let the members speak up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman also sharply criticized the tactics Mr. Silver used in the last few days to crush the uprising, saying they were typical of the authoritarian rule Mr. Silver had imposed over the house since he took power in 1994. ''The speaker has demonstrated to the public in the last couple of days what he is all about,'' Mr. Bragman said. ''This is a one-man operation. The members are not participating. They are not being treated with respect.''</p>
        <p>A speaker is traditionally chosen by the majority party's members in an election held behind closed doors at the start of a newly elected Legislature's two-year term. When a candidate emerges with a majority, the full Assembly is convened and the members of the majority party unite behind that candidate in a formal vote.</p>
