        <p>The urbane, soft-spoken Seymour Milstein and his blustery, cigar-waving brother, Paul, used their good cop, bad cop approach to deal-making over the last five decades to turn their father's Bronx flooring company into a vast empire worth an estimated $5 billion.</p>
        <p>They made multiple fortunes in real estate, banking and the food industry, fought city officials and preservationists to a standstill and amassed holdings from the Upper East Side to Battery Park City.</p>
        <p>But now, the seemingly unbreakable ties between the two men are fraying in an ugly rift over control of the empire and succession. It has spawned lawsuits, severed longstanding partnerships and pitted brother against brother, cousin against cousin.</p>
        <p>At stake is control of millions of square feet of office space, tens of thousands of Manhattan apartments and the family's crown jewel: Emigrant Savings Bank, one of New York's oldest financial institutions.</p>
        <p>One of the sharpest battles is taking place over a parking lot at Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street, whose value has soared with the resurgence of Times Square to more than $100 million in the 16 years since the brothers and their partners bought it for $5 million.</p>
        <p>Seymour Milstein and the partners recently blocked Paul's son Howard, 49, from developing the parcel on his own by abruptly dissolving the partnership and putting the land up for sale. Howard counterattacked by suing Emigrant over the role of Seymour's son, Philip, 50, the bank's chief executive.</p>
        <p>''They're fighting over the very things they built together,'' said Stephen B. Siegel, president of the Insignia/ESG brokerage firm and one of the few people who knows the family who was willing to speak for the record, no matter how briefly. ''I always find these family battles distressing.''</p>
        <p>Not one of the combatants was willing to talk publicly about the dispute. But a picture of the infighting between the billionaires emerged from court records and from friends and supporters of the factions who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The real estate dynasties that rule New York have certainly had their share of blood-curdling feuds. The family of Sol Goldman, the land speculator, waged a bitter seven-year battle over his billion-dollar estate. And more than one family has seen a son chafe under the bridle of his father's oversized personality and flee the business. But never have the internecine rifts been so deep and over so big a prize.</p>
        <p>The fighting has ensnared another large real estate family, that of the late Jack D. Weiler, as well as John E. Zuccotti, the lawyer and former city official who is a confidant to real estate titans, from Mortimer B. Zuckerman to Paul Milstein. Many on the sidelines have reacted with sadness over the squabbling between the once inseparable brothers as they enter their 80's and with amusement as a wealthy family with a reputation for litigious, bare-knuckled tactics turns on itself.</p>
        <p>''The Milstein family has a long history of tough and often controversial dealings dating back to the 1960's,'' said Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society. ''They were respected for their business acumen, but never confused with saints or sweethearts.''</p>
        <p>Paul and Seymour Milstein went to work for their father, Morris, after World War II. Until recently, the two brothers had a lifelong division of labor, according to friends and real estate executives.</p>
        <p>Paul, now 78, was a hard-charging Runyonesque character from the old school of New York real estate who wore pinkie rings on both hands and punctuated his profane talk with a large cigar. He was a builder, a bricks-and-mortar man. An executive recalled how Paul cursed and screamed at Samuel J. Lefrak, an equally voluble builder, for 30 minutes before the conversation wound down; the two men then asked about each other's wives and hung up.</p>
        <p>Seymour, who will be 80 in July and has a demeanor more like that of a secretary of state or a corporate executive, handled the economic terms of the projects and the family's critical financial relationships with various banks. Both men were tough, friends said, and neither took a step without consulting the other.</p>
        <p>''They seemed to be a perfect combination,'' said William J. Stern, a former chairman of the state's Urban Development Corporation. ''Paul, who commanded attention, was funnier, gruffer and more outspoken. But he had a great deference to Seymour. When Seymour spoke, Paul listened.''</p>
        <p>They worked with their father at the Circle Floor Company, which later won contracts to make floor tile for Sears and to install flooring at many New York landmarks, like Rockefeller Center, the United Nations, the World Trade Center and Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, Paul built the family's first apartment house, the 35-story Dorchester Tower at Broadway and 68th Street, followed by a 42-story building east of Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>The projects established a pattern of conflict with city officials. In 1981, the Milsteins outraged city officials and preservationists by demolishing the landmark Palm Court lounge and gilded clock at the Biltmore Hotel on Madison Avenue, after promising to restore them as part of what is now Bank of America Plaza.</p>
        <p>In the 1970's, the family took control of United Brands, the food company, and Starrett Housing Corporation, a real estate company. They later sold the companies for a profit, and in 1986, took over the failing Emigrant Savings Bank. They poured $90 million into the bank, which Bert Ely, a bank analyst, said is worth $1.5 billion to $2 billion.</p>
        <p>During the 1980's, the Milsteins built Normandie Court and Windsor Court on the Upper East Side and the Liberty buildings at Battery Park City, but have been quiet in the current real estate boom.</p>
        <p>Now the two brothers, who live in apartments high atop the family's Bristol Plaza complex on Third Avenue and still go into work at the family's Midtown offices, are at odds over the question of succession. Friends said Seymour, the older brother, wants out of the real estate business and would rather liquidate the family's holdings than allow his nephew Howard to take control.</p>
        <p>Paul's son has adopted his father's bombastic mien to much less effect while working in real estate and pursuing membership, unsuccessfully, in the elite club of National Football League team owners. He is an intensely smart, ambitious man who friends conceded is also arrogant to a fault. Seymour and his son rarely get along with him.</p>
        <p>Although Howard was never able to get out from under his father's shadow as a builder, his friends and supporters credit him with devising the marketing plan for the Bristol Court complex on the Upper East Side that enabled the family to double their rental revenue, and reviving the Milford Plaza Hotel on Eighth Avenue. He also created Liberty Cable, a challenger to Time Warner's dominance of cable television in Manhattan, and rebuilt the Douglas Elliman realty company, later sold for an estimated $80 million profit.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Howard engaged in public feuds with Time Warner, the developer Peter Malkin and the N.F.L., which rejected his bids to acquire the Cleveland Browns and the Washington Redskins. His highly publicized plan to revive Niagara Falls went nowhere. Meetings with Howard were described as ''audiences,'' and even his friends attribute his imperial style to a difficult relationship with his domineering father.</p>
        <p>A real estate executive who considers Howard to be the family's natural heir said: ''Howard is the brightest one in the family. Out of insecurity, he has to tell people how smart he is. People think he's too brash, too arrogant, too confrontational. He learned that from his father. The difference is that Howard doesn't know when to back off.''</p>
        <p>People on both sides of the conflict said Howard's father had been less focused and often forgetful since heart surgery a couple of years ago. After the Milsteins began pouring the foundation for a large apartment tower at First Avenue and 61st Street, Seymour realized that his brother could not handle building another project and sold the property last year for $45 million to Daniel Brodsky, a developer. At the time, Howard and his brother, Edward, were preoccupied with trying to buy the Redskins for $800 million.</p>
        <p>''Seymour didn't think Paul was up to it, and he was right,'' said an executive who has worked closely with the family. ''Paul was screaming, 'I'll build it; I'll never sell!' But he's never really said no to his older brother. At the end of the day, Paul knew his older brother had his interests at heart.''</p>
        <p>With his father less active in the family business, Howard has tried to assert his leadership. That has brought him into conflict with his uncle and his cousin.</p>
        <p>The simmering rivalry spilled into court last year after Howard sold Douglas Elliman for a total of about $85 million to Insignia Financial and refused to give Seymour's son a share of the proceeds.</p>
        <p>His cousin, Philip, filed suit in Delaware, claiming he had not been notified of the pending sale despite his position as a shareholder and director of the company. He demanded a look at the company's books, raising suspicions that Howard may have used the company's resources to fuel his unsuccessful bid for the  Redskins, which friends say Howard denies doing.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Howard moved to develop the last open parcel in the Times Square redevelopment area, a 40,000-square-foot parking lot on 42nd Street. But each time he talked to Ernst &amp; Young, the developer Jerry I. Speyer or The New York Times about building a 1.1-million-square-foot tower on the site, Seymour Milstein or Alan Weiler, whose family owned half the parcel, would send an embarrassing letter to the companies stating that Howard did not represent the owners. (The Times is now negotiating over a different site nearby.)</p>
        <p>In 1994, the partners worked cooperatively but unsuccessfully to develop a hotel, movie complex and studio for Home Box Office on the site. Claiming that Howard had violated the traditional consensus that governed the parking lot, Mr. Weiler, a lawyer who worked for the Milsteins for more than 20 years, and Seymour Milstein, whose wing of the family had a 20 percent share in the parcel, dissolved the partnership in April and moved to sell the land.</p>
        <p>Howard responded by filing court papers claiming that his father had designated him, his brother and Mr. Zuccotti as the developers of the site. ''Even though Paul likes to beat up on Howard,'' said a person who knows Paul well, ''he was hoping his son could've done that one on his own.''</p>
        <p>In a slap at his uncle, Howard described him in an affidavit as a ''passive partner in Paul Milstein's real estate ventures,'' a claim that even Howard's biggest boosters said was inaccurate and unfair. Both sides have now agreed to sell the parking lot, which has attracted nearly every developer in the city.</p>
        <p>Last month, the fighting intensified when Howard also filed a suit seeking to oust Philip as chief executive of Emigrant Savings Bank. He accused his cousin of engaging in a ''campaign of corporate misconduct'' to keep his hold on the bank and reneging on a longstanding promise to make him co-chief executive.</p>
        <p>The suit said that Philip had failed to maximize the bank's profits and exposed the company to unnecessary tax burdens. Philip has retained the support of 11 of the 17 bank directors who are not named Milstein, but the gulf between the two wings of the family remains wide open.</p>
        <p>''This never would have happened if Paul didn't have some problems,'' said a person who has known the family for decades. ''He was always able to keep the lid on the explosive generational issues.''</p>
        <p>So far, Philip and his father have rejected a suggestion by Howard and his father that they split the bank into two parts, or hire professional managers. Some people who know the elder Milsteins predicted that the family might start selling property, which would have been unthinkable five years ago.</p>
        <p>''They don't really want to be in business with each other,'' one said. ''That's why Seymour wants to liquidate.''</p>
