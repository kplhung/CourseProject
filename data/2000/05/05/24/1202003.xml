        <p>The hecklers stepped up to the curb along Eighth Avenue yesterday as a distinctive red double-decker bus from New York Apple Tours rolled past.</p>
        <p>''Killers! Killers!'' yelled a neatly dressed man in a black T-shirt and black leather jacket, standing on the corner of 58th Street.</p>
        <p>''You know this finger?'' bellowed back the tour guide in his distinctive yellow sweatshirt, making an obscene gesture with his right hand from atop the bus.</p>
        <p>Minutes earlier, at 47th Street, about two blocks from where a similar Apple Tours bus driven by a man without the proper license had struck and killed a man on Monday, another pedestrian also accosted the bus.</p>
        <p>''They killed a neighbor!'' he yelled. ''Ask to see his driver's license. It should be posted. Make sure he has a license!''</p>
        <p>''Get a job!'' an Apple Tours employee retorted.</p>
        <p>The dozen or so tourists on board looked somewhat bewildered, unsure why their bus was attracting such ire. Things on the bus were also a little confusing. First a guide said the bus was headed downtown, to Battery Park and the  Statue of Liberty ferry. Then a new guide got on, and after the bus was moving announced it was going uptown, through Harlem. Then it went downtown.</p>
        <p>The tours, which depart every 20 minutes, offer a singular -- not to say skewed -- view of the city to riders who spend a minimum of $26 per tour and are pressed to spend $40 for the two-day version the minute they step forward.</p>
        <p>The guide's presentation was heavy on things like celebrity residents, expensive stores and famous corporate headquarters, along with a light smattering of history.</p>
        <p>At Grand Army Plaza, for example, the tour guide pointed out that the statue depicting General Sherman was covered in 22-karat gold.  Those who did not know that it was Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, the Union general, were out of luck. Riders did learn, though, that the singer Janet Jackson has an apartment on the same street and that the Indian restaurant Nirvana atop one building has really good views of Central Park.</p>
        <p>At Rockefeller Center, the guide said all the flags around the skating rink represented the members of the United Nations. They are, in fact, the flags of the 50 states.</p>
        <p>The guide even worked in opinions about politics. He said New York's sharp drop in crime had more to do with things like panhandlers getting jobs in the strong economy than with anything Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had done. The exception was the mayor's relationship with the police, he said, adding, ''If you watched the news, you would hear about many cases of police brutality.''</p>
        <p>It took about two hours for the bus to wend its way from Times Square to Battery Park, by which time the heavy exposure to exhaust  made for red eyes and a burning throat. The tourists swiveled their heads from side to side but rarely spoke.</p>
        <p>Some said they really liked the tours, because  it was convenient to jump on and off all day. Riders can spend 30 minutes at Rockefeller Center, for example, and then hop on the next bus that comes along for the Empire State Building or the World Trade Center, among other stops.</p>
        <p>''You can cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time,'' said Frank Glasson, a musician from San Diego visiting with his wife, Robyn. It was hit and miss with the guides, though. The Glassons said they had one who stayed silent for long periods and spoke in impenetrable English.</p>
