        <p>It is all within the hands of the Yankees players, of course. If they win consistently and convincingly, George Steinbrenner can be placated and there will not be any trades. It is in the hands of Ricky Ledee and Alfonso Soriano and Roger Clemens.</p>

        <p>It is all within the hands of the Yankees players, of course. If they win consistently and convincingly, George Steinbrenner can be placated and there will not be any trades. It is in the hands of Ricky Ledee and Alfonso Soriano and Roger Clemens.</p>
        <p>If they lose, Steinbrenner will react. It has been that way for more than a quarter of a century, it will be that way this year, even with a team coming off back-to-back championships. Losing angers him and he must have been apoplectic tonight watching the Chicago White Sox slam five homers and destroy Clemens and the Yankees, 8-2. Since that moment when Derek Jeter removed himself from a game May 11, the Yankees are 2-8.</p>
        <p>The Boston Red Sox lost, too, and the Yankees (24-17) remain one game out of first place in the American League East. But there are growing signs of lassitude, the sense that the players themselves believe they need an injection of talent on their roster. Yankees Manager Joe Torre acknowledged frustration is inevitable at times like this, and reiterated that the team must keep grinding away. ''There's no question you get down, but you have to do something about that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner's instinct is always to do something, to respond. It infuriates him to see the Yankees get whipped the way they did tonight. It must make him mad when pitchers like Chicago's Kip Wells stifle the offense of the Yankees. Wells, after all, was called up from Class AAA to start this game, having earned his prior demotion by compiling a 2-3 record and a 7.28 earned run average, and he held the Yankees to two runs over six and two-thirds innings. This, only two days after Cleveland's Paul Rigdon shut them out on two hits over seven innings in his major league debut.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner cannot stand that. The Yankees had runners at second and third in the third inning tonight, after Soriano and Chuck Knoblauch hit back-to-back singles and Soriano led a double steal. Bernie Williams struck out on a high fastball, and Paul O'Neill whiffed on a high breaking ball. Tino Martinez salvaged that inning by lining a two-run single, but it was as if this was a monumental breakthrough of offense -- and the Yankees led, 2-1.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner must love those moments when Clemens overpowers hitters, the way the Yankees envisioned. Clemens froze Frank Thomas with a high fastball in the first inning -- strike three called -- and fanned two more batters in the second. He was throwing 95 to 96 miles an hour. But the game turned for Clemens in the third.</p>
        <p>Catcher Jorge Posada threw to first base in an attempt to pick off Greg Norton, and Norton rolled his ankle returning to the base, flopped over the bag and lurched forward in agony, off the base. Tino Martinez applied the tag. The first-base umpire Laz Diaz ruled that time was out when Norton was tagged, and as Norton was being examined by the White Sox trainer, Torre argued unsuccessfully with Diaz.</p>
        <p>And so it happened that the pinch-runner for Norton, Herbert Perry, would score on a two-out single that tied the game at 2-2. It must have frustrated Steinbrenner.</p>
        <p>It must have gnawed at him that Chris Singleton -- a former Yankees farmhand essentially given away before developing into a solid major leaguer in 1999 -- started the rally in the fourth with a single. Carlos Lee singled, Singleton stopping at second, before Clemens whiffed Perry for the second out.</p>
        <p>Catcher Brook Fordyce was next, playing his first game of the season after an extensive rehabilitation assignment. Clemens fired a 95 m.p.h. fastball, Fordyce anticipated the pitch and drove it into the stands for a three-run homer. ''I wanted to elevate it,'' Clemens said, ''and he got his bat head out.''</p>
        <p>Ray Durham followed with a home run, as well, and the Comiskey Park fans roared, even louder than when a squirrel roamed the outfield earlier in the inning. Clemens (4-4) did not come out for the fifth inning, and relievers Jason Grimsley and Todd Erdos allowed homers, the first against the Yankees' relievers since April 17.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner is not happy the Yankees did not trade for Jim Edmonds in spring training. His executives did not want to include Soriano, a top prospect, and they chose to give Ledee a chance in left field. Soriano, already with six errors, fumbled a ground ball. Ledee hit into a double play. Singleton had another hit. Everything went wrong. Steinbrenner must have been irate.</p>
        <p>It is all in the hands of the Yankees' players, of course. For at least one more day.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DEREK JETER, the Yankees' shortstop, swung a bat for the first time Tuesday since he went to Florida to resume his rehabilitation from a strained abdomen. The Yankees are hopeful Jeter can be activated Saturday, when he's eligible to come off the disabled list. SHANE SPENCER (strained hamstring) could play Wednesday.</p>
