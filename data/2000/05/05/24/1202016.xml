        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Misleading,'' is one of three released yesterday by Jon S. Corzine in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for the Senate from New Jersey. It is being broadcast on television stations in New York and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Shrum, Devine &amp; Donilon.  ON THE SCREEN -- As in all of Mr. Corzine's attack advertisements, his primary opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, is shown in unflattering, slow-motion close-up. An article from The New York Times is shown with the headline, ''Last Year, Florio Backed Plan He Now Denounces.'' The words ''It's pure hypocrisy'' appear on screen, followed by an article from The Trentonian with the headline, ''Report: Florio lied on Social Security.'' It ends with a full-screen shot of Mr. Florio, his face obscured by the question: ''Why would we ever trust him again?''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''For months, Jim Florio has been attacking Jon Corzine's plan to save Social Security. Now, The New York Times reveals that just a year ago, Florio supported the very same plan he now denounces.</p>
        <p>''It's pure hypocrisy. The Trentonian reports Florio lied on Social Security.</p>
        <p>''Over 10 years ago, Jim Florio misled the voters and raised our taxes. This year, Jim Florio is misleading the voters on Social Security. Why would we ever trust him again?''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- It accurately summarizes the news reports it cites, although the Associated Press article  published in The Trentonian did not use the verb ''lied'' to characterize Mr. Florio's statements, contrary to the headline. Until last week, Mr. Florio had denied reports that he once expressed support for a limited government investment in the stock market to bolster Social Security. But on a newly discovered audiotape recorded in May 1999, Mr. Florio spoke at length on the issue, saying he had ''no difficulty'' with such an investment. He now says he simply misspoke on the tape.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Florio has called Social Security the defining issue in the campaign, and Mr. Corzine is trying to hang him with his own words. At stake are the crucial votes of the elderly, who could be as many as a third of the voters.</p>
