        <p>My family moved to the country outside Atlanta when I was around 5. I used to tell people I helped my dad build the old family place. We had a mule, Kate, and a sled, and we'd pick up fieldstones, load the sled and haul it to the house. My mom still lives there.</p>
        <p>I went to work for Georgia Power, a Southern Company affiliate, when I was 19. For the first month or so, I washed meter covers. After eight years and several promotions in the meter department, I got a job repossessing appliances. We were pretty generous; we never repossessed unless the situation was entirely hopeless.

        <p>My family moved to the country outside Atlanta when I was around 5. I used to tell people I helped my dad build the old family place. We had a mule, Kate, and a sled, and we'd pick up fieldstones, load the sled and haul it to the house. My mom still lives there.</p>
        <p>I went to work for Georgia Power, a Southern Company affiliate, when I was 19. For the first month or so, I washed meter covers. After eight years and several promotions in the meter department, I got a job repossessing appliances. We were pretty generous; we never repossessed unless the situation was entirely hopeless. The man I worked for, Walter Bartley, was a great role model.</p>
        <p>I had been going to college at night. One day, Walter called me into his office and said, ''You dropped out.'' I said, ''Yessir.'' He said he was going to school, too, in Athens, driving 60 miles each way twice a week. He said, ''You go about six miles to school, right?'' I said ''Yessir.'' He said, ''Well if you don't go back, I'm gonna fire you.'' I graduated when I was 30. He didn't graduate till he was almost 40.</p>
        <p>I've been with the Southern Company, through one affiliate or another, for 40 years, working my way up in operations, finance and marketing. I understand the fundamentals of electricity. I always tell people I signed up to take the correspondence course and never got beyond batteries. Actually, I flunked batteries.</p>
        <p>As chief executive, I've been known to dress in funny outfits. I created a George Patton uniform. I've worn a gorilla suit. Was a bhagwan. A ninja. A coach. Most of the time it's been internal at the company. If it inspires someone, that's great. If it makes it fun to work at the company, that's great. I don't mind one bit if people laugh at me.</p>
        <p>My office is filled with things people send me. If people come by, they like to see that what they sent is there. Our 1999 annual report had a ''This is not Joe'' theme; I just got a hat with ''I'm not Joe'' on it, and I'm expecting more Joe things. When we did the gorilla, I got gorillas -- 12 of them. I have a hockey stick from the new Atlanta team. A baseball that Hank Aaron sent. A hat that Michael Jordan sent.</p>
        <p>I also have a flamingo from some employees who were very special to me. When I worked in Birmingham for Southern Company Services, the engineering group was in an office park, on a lake that had black Russian swans. I went to visit some of the group at one of our nuclear power plants, trudging though mud and gravel to the trailer office. They said things like, ''Sure would be nice to be back by the lake.'' When I got back home, I sent a plastic pink flamingo, so they could have their own bird. They decided they'd ''give'' it every month to an employee who had distinguished himself, and they called it the Bill Dahlberg Quality of Life Award. When I became president of Georgia Power, they sent it back, saying I'd done something to be proud of. That flamingo is sitting right there on the windowsill. Still has the award tag on it.</p>
        <p>I've got a couple of Harleys. I like riding them up in the Georgia mountains. My wife, Jill, will get on the back of one and ride with me sometimes. She says I need one of those orange flags and training wheels. She's not so trusting of me on a bike. But she looks good in leather.</p>
        <p>I used to think that if I weren't doing what I do, I'd want to own a professional basketball team. Now, I want to open up a bait and tackle shop in northern Georgia. Just sell fishing licenses and worms. I don't like to fish; just like to sell licenses and worms.</p>
