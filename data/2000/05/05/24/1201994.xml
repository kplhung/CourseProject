        <p>When an 18-year-old prepares to move from high school to college, his mother tells him to clean up his room and throw out some of the old junk. One artifact excavated is an Ontario Hockey League yearbook from 1990-91, taken home from one of dad's newspaper reporting assignments. On the cover is 18-year-old Eric Lindros of the Oshawa Generals, the big No. 88 in white numerals on the right sleeve of his red uniform.</p>
        <p>''The future of hockey,'' declares the equipment ad, also with a picture of Lindros, on Page 42. ''Consensus No. 1 National Hockey League pick next June,'' says the thumbnail biography on Page 62.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was an odd day to pick this book up because Lindros and the Philadelphia Flyers announced that he plans to play tonight when his team meets the Devils in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals. Although ''the future of hockey'' has had great moments and even great seasons in the past decade, his career has been plagued by injuries and controversy.</p>
        <p>Recovering from his fifth concussion, Lindros has not played for more than two months. With his team leading by three games to two in the four-of-seven-game series, Lindros will try to join a full-tilt series already marked by concussions, severe cuts and other serious injuries. Thinking back, you remember how big and tough and indestructible Lindros seemed as a junior and even early in his professional career.</p>
        <p>You think of how fragile he now seems, at 27, of how concussions cause more damage when they accumulate and of how Lindros's younger brother, Brett, had to retire because of them. You wonder what the Devils think, so you listen to them after their meeting at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''In the playoffs, you never know,'' said Claude Lemieux, the veteran Devil known for rugged and intimidating play. ''People will do whatever it takes to win. I've heard so much about his coming back. Him being the captain. No longer the captain. May never play again for the Flyers. May play again for the Flyers. Flyers don't want him back. He wants to be back. This story, that story. He's skating. He wasn't skating. Two more weeks. Maybe not. Maybe he's playing tomorrow. That's their issues. That's their problem.''</p>
        <p>And you wonder exactly what problems could come. Will Lindros work only on the power plays, stay out of collisions, help the team in a limited way? Or will his return disrupt line combinations, create resentment among players whose roles are reduced, distract the focus of the team that needs but one victory to clinch a berth in the Stanley Cup finals?</p>
        <p>Yes, the Devils have considered it. Of course they know how distractions at crucial times can disrupt a team. Will Lindros do this to the Flyers? ''That's a good question,'' said the Devils' Bobby Holik, like Lindros, a big center. ''But not for us.'' He flashed a small smile.</p>
        <p>Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, offered a similar response.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' he said. ''That's for them to find out.'' Stevens is the hardest body-checker on the Devils, and in past seasons his battles with Lindros have been memorable. ''If you get a chance to hit, you're going to hit,'' Stevens said. ''You don't fool around with concussions. He's obviously able to take a hit and give a hit.''</p>
        <p>And then there is Martin Brodeur, the goalie, calling Lindros a great player, and predicting he will force the Flyers to change their lines and noting ''they have had a lot of success without him.''</p>
        <p>You recall how intimidating Lindros could be in the N.H.L. and especially back in juniors, when he knocked over rivals like so many bowling pins, sometimes in a demonstrative and calculating way. You remember his parents, Carl and Bonnie, always around, guiding his career, trying to protect him from business predators who hoped to milk money from his potential and his talent.</p>
        <p>You remember conversations with his parents over the years, on the telephone or outside arenas, as his injuries multiplied and his relations frayed with management and teammates. You wonder whether he is trying to come back too soon not only to help the team but because he will be a restricted free agent this summer. With the Flyers very likely to let Lindros leave, he needs to show other teams he can still play.</p>
        <p>And as you type, you glance back at the picture of the kid on the yearbook cover and you wonder about young men on the brink of great things and about parenthood and about how life sometimes takes unexpected and unpleasant turns down the road. You push the buttons on the keyboard, send your column to the office computer and wonder what story and picture the next day will bring.</p>
