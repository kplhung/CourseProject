        <p>AMERICANS have always been enamored of lawn mower beers, the sort of light-bodied, thirst-quenching brews you can toss back after a hot couple of hours on the tractor. America's most popular beers, like Coors and Budweiser, are in this category, but are essentially tasteless, with little character. Yet, hot weather beers do not have to be so inconsequential. Consider wheat beers, the champions of lawn mower beers.</p>
        <p>Ordinary beers are made principally with fermented barley. The best use 100 percent barley, while cheaper brews cut the barley with corn, rice or other ingredients.</p>

        <p>AMERICANS have always been enamored of lawn mower beers, the sort of light-bodied, thirst-quenching brews you can toss back after a hot couple of hours on the tractor. America's most popular beers, like Coors and Budweiser, are in this category, but are essentially tasteless, with little character. Yet, hot weather beers do not have to be so inconsequential. Consider wheat beers, the champions of lawn mower beers.</p>
        <p>Ordinary beers are made principally with fermented barley. The best use 100 percent barley, while cheaper brews cut the barley with corn, rice or other ingredients.</p>
        <p>Wheat beers are made with (you guessed it) wheat, usually along with barley. The wheat produces light- to medium-bodied beers -- ales, if you want to be technical -- that are highly fizzy, tart and dry, and often lower in alcohol than ordinary beers.</p>
        <p>Within the wheat category are many styles. Belgian wheat beers are among the best and most refreshing. They have a sweet-and-sour flavor that might resemble lemonade, except that brewers traditionally blend in flavorings like coriander and Curacao orange peel, which gives the brew a spicy citrus flavor. Belgian wheat beers are often called white ales, for their cloudy pale yellow appearance.</p>
        <p>Bavarian wheat beers are a little heavier-bodied but are likewise quenchingly tart, with flavors that typically include clove, smoke and -- trust me on this -- bananas and bubble gum. One of the most popular German styles is Hefeweizen, meaning wheat with yeast. The yeast particles are not filtered out of these crisp, perfumed beers, leaving them cloudy with sediment. If you don't mind a slightly heavier body, the darker Bavarian wheats can be excellent, with flavors bordering on toffee and chocolate.</p>
        <p>One more style worth mentioning is from Berlin. This beer is thin and sharp, and not altogether pleasant drunk on its own. But the Berliners typically toss in a shot of raspberry or herbal syrup, which immediately transforms the acidic brew into a sweet and mellow refreshment.</p>
