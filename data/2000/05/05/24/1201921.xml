        <p>As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he added $75,000 to the Agriculture Department's budget to cover the cost of public hearings to ensure that the salmon are included in the federal organic standards expected to go into effect at the end of the year.

        <p>SENATOR TED STEVENS of Alaska says the wild salmon that swim around the waters of his state are so pure and clean they are entitled to wear the organic label.</p>
        <p>As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he added $75,000 to the Agriculture Department's budget to cover the cost of public hearings to ensure that the salmon are included in the federal organic standards expected to go into effect at the end of the year. The proposed standards will cover everything except aquatic animals and honeybees, but the Alaska salmon industry is pushing for the change in the rules because the organic label generally adds 25 to 35 percent to the value of a product.</p>
        <p>Since Senator Stevens, a Republican, holds the purse strings for the Agriculture Department and could easily derail the new organic labeling regulation, his request is making the department uneasy. According to documents of the National Organic Standards Board, organic certification standards should not be developed for wild animals, including fish, because the issue is controversial. Organic farming as it has been defined for 30 years is a managed system tracking everything that goes into production, but salmon migrate thousands of miles across oceans and their habitats cannot be carefully monitored.</p>
        <p>Instead of the organic label, the department is suggesting labeling to indicate the products were harvested and handled according to certain standards. The Marine Stewardship Council, an accreditation body founded by Unilever and the World Wildlife Fund that has developed ecolabel guidelines, would certify that such fish had come from healthy fisheries and that fishing for them had not hurt the environment.</p>
        <p>Katherine DiMatteo, executive director of the Organic Trade Association, said: ''We are not willing to come up with a set of standards for organic fish. There is very little control of the system.''</p>
        <p>Calling Alaskan salmon organic, she said, has nothing to do with the philosophy of organic agriculture and improving the environment, but everything to do with money. ''We feel we shouldn't be pressured by an interest group who wants the organic label for marketing purposes,'' she said. ''That's the very wrong reason to ask us to change our 30 years of work. In fact, it cheapens the organic label.''</p>
        <p>The largest natural foods supermarket chain, Whole Foods, says it will not sell organic fish. ''Under no circumstances,'' said Margaret Wittenberg, the chain's vice president of governmental and public affairs. ''Wild is organic by neglect and it's not the same. Wild does need more recognition, but allowing wild fish to piggyback on organic is going to water down organic.''</p>
        <p>For those who have watched organic grow from a much mocked description of the weeds and seeds sold in grungy stores and eaten by hippies in Birkenstocks in the 1970's to one that confers a premium price, this triumphal moment, when federal organic standards will become a reality, is bringing a new set of problems. Alaska is not the only entity that wants to cash in on the organic cachet. Large food companies are increasingly buying up small organic companies, not to improve the environment but to improve their bottom lines. Organic sales have increased about 20 percent annually for the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>''Organic is a useful marketing tool,'' said Kate Troll, the fisheries specialist at the Alaska Department of Commerce and Economic Development. ''This is a way to sell at a better price.''</p>
        <p>Our salmon ''is beyond organic,'' said Doug Mecum, director of commercial fisheries in the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. ''It's totally natural and wild. It's a healthy product, free of pollutants.''</p>
        <p>In the past, the state has promoted its wild salmon as superior to farmed in flavor and quality. But few people know the difference between wild and farmed salmon and have no idea which kind they are eating. Farmed salmon now account for 60 percent of the world's market and have seriously depressed the price of wild salmon.</p>
        <p>Like commercial chickens, farmed fish live in not particularly sanitary conditions. They are fed dye pellets to give them the pink color that occurs naturally in free-swimming salmon. They eat manufactured food that may contain genetically modified ingredients. They are treated with antibiotics because of fish lice.</p>
        <p>Ironically, because the farmed fish live their entire lives in controlled waters, they could be certified organic if changes were made in their environment and food. Certified organic farmed fish are already being sold in Britain.</p>
        <p>That label for farmed salmon is seen as an additional threat to wild Alaskan salmon. ''We saw that the door was going to be opened to farm-raised salmon,'' Ms. Troll said, ''and we thought we needed a level playing field.''</p>
        <p>Two Pacific Northwest fish processors are now certified organic by two independent organic certifying agencies. Prime Select Seafood in Cordova, Alaska, is selling certified organic Copper River salmon and eventually may sell organic halibut as well. But Susan Laird, its vice president, said she had no idea if the label would be worth the added expenses of certification.</p>
        <p>Wild sockeye salmon processed by Capalino Pacific in Bellingham, Wash., has also been certified organic, but the company decided not to use the label after consulting with some leading chefs. The chefs said that organic salmon suggested farmed and that wild salmon was far superior.</p>
        <p>''Organic is a lot sexier,'' said Jon Saarheim, a partner in Capalino Pacific, ''but it seems more accurate to say the salmon is wild and that it is sustainable. So we label it 'certified sustainably wild and organically processed,' '' the wording approved by the Marine Stewardship Council.</p>
        <p>''We're taking the high road by giving up organic,'' Mr. Saarheim said. ''In the long term, it's confusing.''</p>
        <p>Could Senator Stevens be coming to the same conclusion? ''Labeling something organic could be a first step toward wild salmon,'' he said in an interview, ''but organic could also cover farm-raised.'' And the problem with that, he said, is: ''There is a great deal of difference between salmon that spend a great portion of their lives in deep cold waters and those raised on a farm. They are not subject to any kind of runoff from farmlands, pesticides, to the growth of viruses in tanks or ponds. They really are disease free. Wild salmon or 'saumon sauvage,' which we consider superior, comes from the cold deep ocean waters. There may be another classification that will do the same thing.''</p>
        <p>Now there is an even greater threat to wild salmon lurking in some of those ponds where salmon are farmed: a genetically engineered version that grows quickly. Should those fish escape from their ponds, they could cause havoc to the ecosystem and might signal the end of a truly wild variety. Even an organic label would not help the industry then.</p>
