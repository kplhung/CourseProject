        <p>THE Interpublic Group of Companies in New York is significantly stepping up its commitment to the fast-growing realm of specialized marketing services outside the scope of traditional advertising.</p>
        <p>Interpublic, which owns agencies like Draft Worldwide, Initiative Media Worldwide, McCann-Erickson and the Lowe Group, is reorganizing a division known as the Allied Communications Group, handling tasks for clients ranging from research to consulting to talent management. The changes, described in interviews yesterday by top executives, include the appointment of the first management team devoted full time to Allied Communications and the addition of public relations agencies to the division.</p>
        <p>The revamping is the first major initiative undertaken by the new president and chief operating officer of Interpublic, John J. Dooner Jr., since he took those posts on April 1. Mr. Dooner had been chairman and chief executive of the McCann-Erickson World Group, the largest agency network of Interpublic, where he directed an extensive expansion into services similar to those offered by the Allied Communications shops. That expansion helped McCann-Erickson to triple in size under his stewardship.</p>
        <p>''At Interpublic, we've strived to get that balance between our core business, advertising and other communications, and we're about 50-50,'' Mr. Dooner said. ''If there's anything I learned out of World Group that I'm applying here, it's this: consolidation, integration and expansion.</p>
        <p>''You look to consolidate, where applicable, to get you the clout you need,'' he added. ''You look to integrate to optimize the use of these services by various clients. And you look to expand to get growth.''</p>
        <p>A primary goal of the reorganization is to make sure that the larger Interpublic agencies, with strengths in traditional advertising, are familiar with the offerings of their Allied Communications siblings.</p>
        <p>''It's important we start to bring a strong focus to the integration and cross-selling of these communications disciplines for the purposes of organic growth,'' said Larry Weber, who becomes chairman and chief executive at Allied Communications, effective immediately.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weber, 44, had been chairman and chief executive at Weber Public Relations Worldwide in Cambridge, Mass., which handles corporate communications for clients in the high-technology and interactive fields. As an example of the integration the reorganization is intended to encourage, Mr. Weber cited the selection of Weber to handle public relations for the electronic commerce operations of General Motors, which uses Interpublic agencies for traditional advertising.</p>
        <p>Weber, founded in 1987, was sold to McCann-Erickson in 1996.</p>
        <p>''I've got to hand it to John Dooner because when he approached us to buy us, I was skeptical,'' Mr. Weber said, adding: ''He was hard-selling the idea of public relations being equal to advertising at the table. I took him at his word and, boy, did he mean it.''</p>
        <p>Weber is one of three public relations agencies that will now report directly to Allied Communications, along with Shandwick International and Golin/Harris International; previously, they had reported indirectly.</p>
        <p>Until the appointment of Mr. Weber, Barry Linsky, senior vice president for planning and business development at Interpublic, had doubled as the chairman and chief executive at Allied Communications.</p>
        <p>''As I've been characterizing it, I've been able to do what must be done rather than what could be done,'' Mr. Linsky said. ''We will benefit from having someone like Larry focus on this full time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dooner said the changes would ''allow Barry to refocus on strategic planning, which he's great at,'' adding that Mr. Weber, ''with his entrepreneurial spirit and Internet background, will be a big plus.'' Mr. Weber will divide his time between Cambridge and New York.</p>
        <p>Under Philip H. Geier, chairman and chief executive, Interpublic has diversified its holdings beyond traditional advertising -- centered on the creation of commercials for television and radio and advertisements for magazines and newspapers -- into fields like public relations, direct marketing, sales promotion, corporate identity consulting and Internet marketing. Mr. Dooner is to succeed Mr. Geier as chief executive on Jan. 1, 2001; Mr. Geier will remain chairman.</p>
        <p>Allied Communications was formed in January 1995. Recent acquisitions that are part of or aligned with the division include NFO Worldwide, the largest custom marketing research company in North America, and substantially all the communications division of Carabiner International, which is being absorbed into the Jack Morton Company, a specialist in so-called experiential marketing (live events, interactive media and exhibits).</p>
        <p>Allied Communications will also get a team of managers to work with Mr. Weber; they are to be named soon. In 2000, Allied Communications is expected to account for more than $1.3 billion of the total Interpublic revenue of $5.5 billion to $6 billion. McCann-Erickson is expected to account for revenue of more than $2.2 billion and Lowe for revenue of more than $1.7 billion.</p>
        <p>After the WPP Group acquires Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., Interpublic will be the world's No. 3 agency company in revenue and No. 2 in billings.</p>
        <p>''It's obvious the Big Three holding companies are moving to a huge revenue and profit base from nontraditional advertising resources,'' Mr. Weber said.</p>
        <p>Allied Communications, as a division with revenue of ''$1.3 billion-plus, is a big group,'' he added, ''and it's not being run by an ad guy.''</p>
