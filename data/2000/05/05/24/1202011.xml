        <p>In the most dramatic and adversarial day in the federal tax-fraud case against Albert J. Pirro Jr., six private investigators from Florida, Indiana and the New York region testified today that they had been hired to help Mr. Pirro fight a paternity suit that he then apparently tried to deduct as a business expense.</p>
        <p>During a series of sometimes testy exchanges with prosecutors, the investigators acknowledged that they had been paid not from Mr. Pirro's personal account, but by one or more companies that he owned. Yet two investigators -- including a former Federal prosecutor -- suggested that Mr. Pirro had hired them only because he felt he was being extorted in the paternity suit.</p>

        <p>In the most dramatic and adversarial day in the federal tax-fraud case against Albert J. Pirro Jr., six private investigators from Florida, Indiana and the New York region testified today that they had been hired to help Mr. Pirro fight a paternity suit that he then apparently tried to deduct as a business expense.</p>
        <p>During a series of sometimes testy exchanges with prosecutors, the investigators acknowledged that they had been paid not from Mr. Pirro's personal account, but by one or more companies that he owned. Yet two investigators -- including a former Federal prosecutor -- suggested that Mr. Pirro had hired them only because he felt he was being extorted in the paternity suit.</p>
        <p>The investigators, who were sandwiched between witnesses discussing such mundane expenses as nanny taxes and home improvement projects, provided the highlights of a whirlwind fourth day of testimony in the trial, one of the most anticipated here in years. At the heart of the case is the government's contention that Mr. Pirro -- Westchester's most prominent and politically connected real estate lawyer -- and his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, illegally deducted more than $1.2 million in personal expenses as business expenditures on his tax returns.</p>
        <p>For the first three days of the trial, a colorful but somewhat predictable cast of contractors had offered meticulous details about the Pirro family's lavish expenditures, from an enclosure for their pet pigs to a buffet table in the dining room. At times, the proceedings became tedious and repetitive; one juror was even gently chided this morning by Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. for nodding off.</p>
        <p>But this afternoon, the courtroom crackled as the opposing parties tangled over paternity and other issues. The session was so contentious, in fact, that the lawyers seemed to spend as much time with the judge in sidebar conferences as they did before the jury.</p>
        <p>For the first time, Mr. Pirro's wife, Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester district attorney, did not attend the proceedings, which dwelled today on the most private of matters.</p>
        <p>One witness, Jerry H. Trachtman, a lawyer and Pirro family friend from Florida, said that Mr. Pirro had asked him to unearth hospital records and unseal divorce records related to Jessica Marciano, a former secretary in Mr. Trachtman's office who said Mr. Pirro was the father of her daughter. Subsequent DNA tests revealed that Mr. Pirro was indeed the father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trachtman said he received a check of $2,076.55 from a Pirro company for his work.</p>
        <p>In nonpaternity matters, one witness, Ken LaCorte, said he had been hired as a political consultant to help the Pirros deal with their failure to pay employment taxes for their nannies at a time when Ms. Pirro was contemplating a run for district attorney.</p>
        <p>At one point, the proceedings became so intense that when the jury was out of session, Elliott B. Jacobson, the lead prosecutor, complained about the behavior of Albert Pirro's lawyers.</p>
        <p>''There's been constant laughing over here,'' he said. ''It's totally unprofessional and uncalled for.''</p>
        <p>Judge Parker put his hands on his jowls, then said drily, ''Gentlemen, behave.''</p>
