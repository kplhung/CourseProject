        <p>Gov. George W. Bush set aside his customary reserve toward House Republicans in a trip to Capitol Hill today and was rewarded with an outpouring of admiration.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush set aside his customary reserve toward House Republicans in a trip to Capitol Hill today and was rewarded with an outpouring of admiration.</p>
        <p>The event was more a pep rally than a formal address as Mr. Bush spoke for about 20 minutes to House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club, underscoring many of his campaign themes. He touched on his plan for a partial privatization of Social Security and mentioned that he would work to overhaul Medicare, repeal the inheritance tax and share part of the budget surplus with taxpayers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, made a point of highlighting themes he believes unite the party and avoided mentioning his past differences with House Republicans over issues like tax credits, lawmakers at the meeting said. And he offered to campaign for House members.</p>
        <p>He also spoke briefly about his support for establishing normal trade relations with China. At one point, he asked members who opposed the measure, scheduled for a vote on Wednesday, to reconsider. Afterward, he buttonholed a few members who were still undecided and tried to persuade them to vote for the measure.</p>
        <p>If House Republicans still felt slighted by Mr. Bush's wary reserve toward them, they did not show it.</p>
        <p>''If you had been in there, you would never think there had been a problem,'' said Representative Charlie Norwood of Georgia. ''How can we all agree with him 100 percent of the time? We don't even agree with our wives 100 percent of the time. But on the big picture, we all agree.''</p>
        <p>Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut said he was impressed with Mr. Bush's sense of conviction, especially on Social Security.</p>
        <p>''He's going to the mat on the Social Security issue because he believes in it,'' Mr. Shays said. ''This is coming from the heart. The conventional wisdom is you don't talk about Social Security. He wants to confront that issue.''</p>
        <p>''There's a real difference between him and Al Gore, and he relishes that,'' Mr. Shays added.</p>
        <p>Members said they left the meeting feeling charged-up about the November elections and about Mr. Bush's prospects, a stark contrast to Bob Dole's meeting with House Republicans four years ago.</p>
        <p>Representative Benjamin A. Gilman of upstate New York called the gathering ''ebullient,'' adding that there was not a single negative vibration.</p>
