        <p>Lebanese feel a tight connection to their native villages, which are listed on their national identity cards from birth to death. When those who have left return to be buried in those same villages, Lebanese say, ''Home is where your head lies.''</p>
        <p>This morning, before it even became clear that the southern zone would open up, Foda Ramadan said she heard the call of her native village, Yarin, in the western sector of the Israeli-occupied zone. She bundled her family into a car and they set out to see how far they could get.</p>
        <p>''It's 20 years since I've been,'' she said early this morning, as she stood by the road, waiting out the stand-still traffic just north of the zone. ''My heart is pulsing.''</p>
        <p>The gates opened unexpectedly. And, part of a spontaneous procession, her battered car bounced over a rutted coastal highway that overlooked the Mediterranean. Two Israeli gunboats appeared as specks on the horizon, fading in her mind as she gained on her village and realized that it would be free.</p>
        <p>Once a town of 5,000, it had dwindled to about 200 people in the previous two decades and, with bombed-out and abandoned buildings, it looked like a ghost town. But to Mrs. Ramadan, it was beautiful. She beamed.</p>
        <p>She found her elderly father sitting on their porch, leaning on his cane and staring into space with a stunned look. The zone was transformed so quickly today that he had a hard time changing gears. Unlike his wife, who had ventured out of the zone for medical treatments, he had not seen most of his children or any of his grandchildren for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ramadan's mother, in contrast, had jumped right into the moment, with bare, weathered feet. Halimeh Touham, the mother, ran into the street with a pink plastic bowl, tossing rice at the passing cars and barking orders at her daughters as they arrived for what was turning into a family reunion: put on the coffee, lay out the honey-drenched sweets.</p>
        <p>''Thank you, thank you,'' she yelled as the guerrillas went honking by. She tackled Mrs. Ramadan with joy. Every other person who stepped foot on her porch got four kisses, alternating cheeks. And several times she instructed visitors to pull their chairs under the overhang because the Israeli choppers were hovering.</p>
        <p>The whistling of not-very-distant bombs punctuated her celebration. A wizened neighbor said, ''They are hitting. May they go to hell.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ramadan's brother, Jihad Akesh, 30, wore a backwards baseball cap. He was a veteran of three years in the South Lebanon Army-run prison for fighting with the guerrillas, as was the severely deformed neighbor who showed up on their porch. The neighbor had landed on a mine when he tried to escape from the jail.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Touham said she used to go to the militia-guarded checkpoint and literally kiss the soldiers' boots to get them to consider her request to visit her son in prison. ''I debased myself, as low as a person can get, and I still didn't succeed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Akesh watched the passing cars wistfully. He regretted that he was not riding into town a hero. He had abandoned the military battle when he was released from prison. Sighing, he rose to return to his home in the north. He was going to fetch his belongings so he could move back in with his parents.</p>
        <p>''Look,'' his mother said, pointing into the distance. ''See where the sunlight is glinting off metal? That's the fence, the Israeli checkpoint.'' She said she hoped that the fighting would cease entirely. ''That is the border. It is a fact.''</p>
