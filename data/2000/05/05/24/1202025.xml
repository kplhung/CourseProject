        <p>The first step was taken in Philadelphia Monday night, when the Devils convincingly brushed aside the uninspired Flyers. But despite a 4-1 victory to stave off elimination, the team still has a treacherous climb before advancing in the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
        <p>The next test is Game 6 at Continental Arena Wednesday night, another win-or-go-home scenario.</p>
        <p>Adding to the playoff drama is that Eric Lindros will be with the Flyers for the first time in the playoffs. Despite the controversy surrounding Lindros's concussions and the removal of his captaincy, his return should be a huge lift for the Flyers.</p>
        <p>Devils Coach Larry Robinson, who scolded his players after three consecutive losses put them behind by three games to one, said he wasn't worrying about Lindros.</p>
        <p>''We have enough to worry about ourselves,'' Robinson said here this afternoon after another day of just meetings for his players. ''Our biggest problem is what we're going to do because this is a do-or-die situation for us.''</p>
        <p>The victory on Monday narrowed the Flyers' lead to 3-2 in the four-of-seven-game series. Fifteen teams have rallied from 3-1 deficits in the early rounds of the playoffs, including two teams from 3-0, but no team has rallied from 3-1 or 3-2 deficits in the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>''We've got to win the next game, otherwise the last one doesn't mean a thing,'' said Bobby Holik, who has 3 goals in this series after going without a goal in his previous 27 playoff games. ''Last night was the type of game we want to play.''</p>
        <p>Holik said that although the Flyers had room for error, there was no such thing for the Devils. ''We're looking at this as Game 7, while they know that if they lose, they have another chance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Devils sounded convinced today that they could make history if they played the next two games the way they did Monday night in Philadelphia. The sites of the games, they said, was immaterial, but both teams have had more success on the road in these playoffs. The Devils are 4-3 at Continental Arena and 6-2 on the road, while the Flyers are 6-1 on the road and 5-4 at home.</p>
        <p>''Home ice hasn't mattered,'' said Martin Brodeur, who played up to his usual standards Monday night after allowing 11 goals in the previous 3 games. ''But we have to take advantage and do the best we can. We had the experience with Pittsburgh last year.'' The Devils were leading by 3-2 in games against the Penguins in the first round last year and lost the last two games for a first-round exit from the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Brian Rafalski, the rookie defenseman, agreed that home advantage has meant nothing to the Devils.</p>
        <p>''We've done better on the road and this feels like a road game here because they have a lot of fans in this building,'' Rafalski said. ''The thing is that we're desperate and we can't afford any letdowns. What we have to do is play simple and be more aggressive going to the net.''</p>
        <p>Scott Stevens didn't appear too preoccupied with the news that Lindros will play for the Flyers. The captain of the Devils said his team should focus on playing the way it did in the last game.</p>
        <p>''We have to continue what we established last night,'' Stevens said. ''We need all five guys on the ice in every shift, not just three guys playing and two watching.''</p>
        <p>One of Stevens's teammates who may not play at all is Sergei Nemchinov, the reliable and consistent Russian forward. Nemchinov was examined by doctors this afternoon after suffering a cut near his left eye that required 40 stitches in Game 5. The Devils said they would know his status before the game.</p>
        <p>Robinson said that if Nemchinov could not play, his place in the line-up would be taken by Steve Brule, who was ineffective in the one playoff game he played in place of the injured John Madden. So ineffective was Brule that Robinson went to Steve Kelly for the last game in place of Madden.</p>
        <p>Madden skated for the first time today since injuring his right knee in Game 2 in Philadelphia, working out with the spare players the Devils have here from their minor league team. He said he felt well and he might be able to play in a Game 7.</p>
