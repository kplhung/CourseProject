        <p>Block Party</p>
        <p>With appearances by actors including James Earl Jones and performances by the composer David Amram, the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers and by theater organizations ranging from La Mama E.T.C. and Dixon Place to the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and Mabou Mines, the fifth annual Lower East Side Festival of the Arts beckons for the three days beginning on Friday. Ground zero for this event, a free focus on the neighborhood's wealth of cultural attractions, is the Theater for the New City, at First Avenue and East 10th Street. Maria Irene Fornes will contribute a short play written for the festival; excerpts from Arthur Miller's drama ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' will also be performed. An exhibition titled ''The Golden Age of Second Avenue'' will chronicle the Yiddish theater. And with a score of stars and the participation of more than 100 performing arts organizations, the list goes on.</p>

        <p>Bernstein's Vatican 'Mass'</p>
        <p>On June 1, a day of music that will take more than 100 instrumentalists, a marching band, a rock band, two choruses, a boys choir and 21 soloists to Paul VI Hall, Leonard Bernstein's ''Mass'' will be performed at the Vatican as part of the Jubilee 2000 celebrations of the Roman Catholic Church. Composed for the opening of the Kennedy Center in Washington in 1971, the ''Mass,'' exploring a crisis of faith, is subtitled ''A Theater Piece for Singers, Players and Dancers.''</p>
        <p>Brassy Entrance</p>
        <p>Not every evening offers the opportunity to be present at a world premiere. But tomorrow night is such an occasion. At 8 at Avery Fisher Hall, Kurt Masur will lead the New York Philharmonic in the first performance of Lowell Liebermann's Trumpet Concerto, featuring the orchestra's principal trumpeter, Philip Smith. The three-movement concerto was commissioned by John Marsteller and Helen Marsteller Treutel in tribute to Edward Treutel, a trumpet teacher at the Juilliard School for 58 years. The program, to be repeated on Friday and Saturday nights at 8, will be completed by Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7, the ''Leningrad.''</p>
        <p>Night of Flamenco</p>
        <p>Rooted in the ancient folk traditions of Andalusia and shaped by the Gypsy and Moorish cultures of Spain, the music, dance and song of flamenco have been kept alive by dedicated masters. At 7 tonight in the Proshansky Auditorium of the City University Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, Latin American influences on flamenco will be explored in a bilingual talk illustrated with music and dance. Among the participants will be the dancer Milagros Mengibar, winner of the first prize at the national contest in Cordoba in 1974; the singer Calixto Sanchez, winner of first prizes in Granada in 1972 and Cordoba in 1974; the guitarist Manolo Franco, another prizewinner; and the author and historian Fernando Iwasaki.</p>
