        <p>WITH clams, it's cold beer, not Champagne. Oysters call for black tie, but with clams, jeans or shorts are fine. Nobody puts caviar and creme fraiche on clams.</p>
        <p>They are summer food, and their time is nearly here. As the weather warms, out come the clam lovers, at tables spilling onto sidewalks and on decks by the sea. Summer means buckets of nut-sweet steamers to dip in melted butter, platters of golden fried clams, juicy littlenecks, on the half shell or set to sputter open on a charcoal grill.</p>
        <p>For me, and most other clam lovers, the universe was always wondrous, but limited: just littlenecks, cherrystones or steamers. But today, in the market, alongside those familiar Atlantic clams, there are dark-striped Manila clams from Washington State, tiny jade-tinged hard-shelled cockles from New Zealand and bronzed deep-water mahoganies from Maine. Razor clams, shaped like switchblades and streaked white and taupe, used to be a rare find. Even the hulking, cement-gray geoduck clam, a softball-size specimen from the Pacific with an elephantine siphon, is in markets and on menus.</p>
        <p>A couple of years ago, Fairway market sold only about 100 pounds of mahogany clams a week. Now, customers are scooping up 600 pounds a week. Louis Wu, who distributes Manila clams on the East Coast, says that his sales of Manila clams have doubled in five years, to more than a million pounds a year, mainly because non-Asian customers have discovered them. And New Zealand has increased its production of cockles 20 percent to meet the growing demand, said Philip Hall of New Zealand Seafood Marketing, a Los Angeles importer.</p>
        <p>The American appetite for clams is changing. Chefs and diners intent on discovering new flavors and textures have opened the marketplace to a world of clams, thanks to more efficient shipping from afar. Chefs and cooks alike are learning to make distinctions between the varieties of clams and are reaching for specific kinds for specific dishes.</p>
        <p>At Red Cat in Chelsea, Jimmy Bradley chooses tender Manila clams for a Spanish-style sauce infused with sherry. ''I've often done clams with sherry, and the saltiness of these plays off well against the sweet nuttiness of the sherry,'' he said. He also prefers Manilas because they are smaller than littlenecks and open faster than cockles.</p>
        <p>At Chez Louis, in Rockefeller Center, Matthew Tivy, the chef, bathes mahogany clams with a verdant, richly garlicked herb and spinach soup. ''I saw these for the first time at Fairway and thought I'd try them,'' he said. ''Their color is beautiful, and I find the flavor a little richer than the littlenecks.''</p>
        <p>Frank DeCarlo, the chef and owner of Peasant, a downtown restaurant, folds slender razor clams into a risotto to give it the flavor of Venice. ''I love the subtlety of these clams,'' he said. Razor clams are tender, almost gelatinous, with a delicate salinity. At the Sea Grill in Rockefeller Center, Ed Brown scatters tiny cockles around his poached halibut, letting the intense marine flavor enhance the subtler fish.</p>
        <p>And at Le Bernardin in Midtown, Eric Ripert shaves slices of giant geoduck clam to serve, ceviche-style, with a piquant mix of lemon juice and wasabi. ''Sliced very thin, it's tender and has a light marine taste that the lemon brings out,'' Mr. Ripert said. Jeremy Marshall, the chef and an owner of Aquagrill in SoHo, also likes to dress geoduck simply, with rice wine vinegar.</p>
        <p>At one time, cherrystones were the most popular clams on the half shell, but no longer. In the United States, the European taste for smaller clams has been catching on. In Venice, the razor clams are half the width of those sold here, sometimes no longer than three inches, and served grilled on the half shell with a gloss of butter.</p>
        <p>Tellines, often deliciously steamed in France with garlic and parsley, are no bigger than a fingernail. You can spend an hour picking a portion of them out of their shells and still be hungry. Vongole verace, the similar Italian thin-shelled oval miniatures used with pasta, are still unavailable in the United States. The closest American cooks can come are cockles and Manila clams.</p>
        <p>Manila clams were inadvertent hitchhikers from Asia with oysters brought for cultivation to the Pacific Northwest in the 1930's. They have done extremely well. Mr. Wu, whose company, W&amp;T Seafood, is in the Fulton Fish Market, said that when he started in business 14 years ago, he sold mainly to the Asian market for dishes like Cantonese clams in black bean sauce. ''Now, they're for everybody,'' he said. ''But Asian customers want bigger ones. Small ones are for Western clients.''</p>
        <p>At home, any of these clams can be enjoyed simply: just soften a generous helping of garlic and hot red pepper flakes in some good olive oil, add a couple of pounds of well-scrubbed clams, cover the pan to let the clams steam open. Then, fold in some freshly boiled linguine and a handful of chopped parsley.</p>
        <p>The dish can be made more interesting by using a less common shellfish, for instance, cockles, and instead of linguine, small conchiglie pasta. Shells with shells. Chopped ripe tomato and slivers of basil are excellent additions. Cockles, or the newly available and also briny mahoganies, which cook in less time, complement Asian seasonings of lemon grass, garlic, chilis, ginger and lime. A finishing splash of unsweetened coconut milk adds a beautifully enriching grace note.</p>
        <p>Or try cooking a mixture of littlenecks, mahoganies and cockles in white wine and shallots, mussel-style, to let their briny flavors play off one another.</p>
        <p>When clams have been cooked in their shells in a sauce, some will fall out into the pan, leaving empty shells. It's best to discard the empties before serving. In restaurants, chefs purposely remove some clams from the shells. ''We love the way it looks to serve a dish with some clams in the shell, but we find that people prefer to eat them when they're not in the shell,'' Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>The favorite clams to eat raw are littlenecks. ''In summer there's a tremendous demand,'' said Ken Homan, the president of George Braun Oyster in Cutchogue, N.Y., on the North Fork of Long Island. But even littlenecks vary, depending on habitat. For example, Long Island littlenecks tend to be saltier than those from Wellfleet, Mass. But Blue Island littlenecks, now cultivated in Long Island's Great South Bay, are sweet and buttery.</p>
        <p>Littlenecks are Eastern hard-shell clams, like cherrystones and quahogs, differing in age and size. Harvested from Florida to Maine, littlenecks must measure at least an inch from the point of the hinge to the top. It usually takes three years for a clam to reach that size. A Pacific littleneck has a white shell and a chewier texture and is usually not eaten raw.</p>
        <p>Littlenecks were named for Little Neck Bay on Long Island. Cherrystone, the next larger clam, at two and a quarter to three inches, refers to a creek in Virginia. Quahog is an Algonquin Indian word for clams more than three inches, which are mainly chopped up for chowder and clam pie.</p>
        <p>A good fish market will open clams to serve raw on the half shell. The alternative is some skill with a clam knife in the kitchen. A clam knife is not as pointy as an oyster knife and has a sharper cutting edge. I prefer the one made by Oxo, with its comfortable nonslip handle. Never use a regular kitchen knife to open clams.</p>
        <p>Gloves to protect your hands are a good idea. Even a skilled professional like Ricardo Espinoza, the clam shucker at Aquagrill in SoHo, wears thick rubber gloves. Some people advocate putting clams in the freezer for about half an hour to make them easier to open because they supposedly relax a bit. This also freezes the clam and its juices, changing the texture. Once you master the opening technique it is not necessary.</p>
        <p>All clams, regardless of size or variety, must be purchased live. The shells of hard-shell clams will be tightly closed or, if slightly gaping, will close when touched. Soft-shell clams like steamers and razor clams cannot close completely around their protruding necks, but a thin membrane connecting the shells should be in place, and the neck should shrink if lightly touched.</p>
        <p>Avoid clams with broken shells, and always store clams loosely wrapped or just in a bowl in the refrigerator. Never keep them in water or sealed in plastic. Unopened, they will stay fresh and alive for days.</p>
        <p>Shellfish is strictly monitored. In New York State, the Environmental Conservation Department tests shellfishing areas and issues permits. All bags of clams and oysters coming into the wholesale market are tagged to let inspectors identify the source if there is a problem.</p>
        <p>Individuals can obtain shellfish licenses and dig their own, carefully treading the damp sand barefoot at low tide in areas where clamming is permitted. Though you might applaud the entrepreneurial spirit, it is not a good idea to buy a basket from someone's truck parked along the roadside.</p>
        <p>As much as I may love to eat clams outside, I shop for them indoors in impeccable market surroundings.</p>
        <p>Before I cook clams, I scrub them with a stiff brush to remove any sand. I soak steamer or soft-shell clams in cold salted water for at least an hour so they can purge themselves of sand. Some people add flour or cornmeal, but I do not find it makes a difference. The conventional wisdom is also to discard clams that have not opened after cooking. But if you try cooking them a little longer, you may find they will open after all and are just fine.</p>
        <p>Then you can heap them in a bowl with a few ladles of flavorful broth and some crusty bread, pour pale India ale into a frosted mug, kick off your shoes and dig in.</p>

        <p>The Fine Art Of Shucking, Step by Step</p>
        <p>STEP 1: Wear gloves. Hold the clam with the hinge against the base of your thumb. Start to insert the edge of the clam knife, not the tip, between the shells. Then squeeze the fingers of the hand holding the clam against the knife, forcing the blade between the shells.</p>
        <p>STEP 2: Force the knife all the way around between the shells, close to the rim, cutting through the hinge. The knife should never penetrate deeply enough to slice the clam meat.</p>
        <p>STEP 3: Twist the knife to pry the shells apart. Pull off the top shell.</p>
        <p>STEP 4: Run the knife under the clam to release it from the shell.</p>
