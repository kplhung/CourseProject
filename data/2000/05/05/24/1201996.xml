        <p>The plan to merge the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges moved a step forward today when the supervisory board of the German exchange voted to approve the deal.</p>
        <p>The vote, 17 in favor with 4 abstentions, came despite anxieties in each financial center that the merger would lead to the gain of one at the expense of the other.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Borse A.G., parent of the Frankfurt stock exchange, said after the vote that the merger with the London Stock Exchange should be formally completed by the end of the year. The deal must still get at least 75 percent of the vote at the company's annual shareholders meeting in September.</p>
        <p>The supervisory board vote was a significant victory for the German exchange's chief executive, Werner Seifert, who has sought relentlessly to create a pan-European exchange that would offer trading in securities from around the Continent.</p>
        <p>Several board members of Deutsche Borse had criticized the plan and some were pushing for a delay in the vote until more details could be worked out.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Seifert prevailed over the doubters, and won support today from regulators in the state of Hesse, which includes Frankfurt, the country's banking and financial center. The regulators had raised questions about the deal last Friday.</p>
        <p>But the job of completing the merger is far from over. The two exchanges have yet to settle many important points, including their plans for an additional alliance with Nasdaq, the American electronic trading system.</p>
        <p>Executives also face challenges in selling the merger in Britain. The London Stock Exchange is still owned by its many varied members, and smaller brokerage firms feel threatened by the plan.</p>
        <p>Uncertainties about the merger have already affected the readiness of other European exchanges to team up with the London-Frankfurt market, which is to be called iX.</p>
        <p>The Swiss stock exchange said today that it is holding discussions with Tradepoint Financial Networks, a new electronic network based in London that plans to offer trading in European blue-chip stocks.</p>
        <p>Last week, executives at the Bolso in Madrid said they had entered into discussions with Euronext, the recently formed alliance between the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam exchanges. The Madrid and Milan exchanges are also talking with Frankfurt and London.</p>
        <p>The proposed merger between the Deutsche Borse and the London Stock Exchange was announced with great enthusiasm as a ''merger of equals'' two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>If completed, the combined exchange would be the largest in Europe and come closer than any other institution to providing the basis for a pan-European securities market. The combined group would also start a joint venture with Nasdaq aimed at eventually providing access to stocks around the world.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Borse officials told a  news conference after the supervisory board vote that the Nasdaq venture would be based in Frankfurt and would operate under German regulations.</p>
        <p>The details of the Nasdaq venture are to be negotiated within the next  four months, Mr. Seifert said.</p>
        <p>The iX deal also got support from German regulators today. Dieter Posch, economics minister for the state of Hesse, said today he saw no reason to worry about Frankfurt losing important business and no reason to object to the merger.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Posch had demanded that Mr. Seifert respond to a list of 14 questions, many of which concerned how much responsibility and power would be shifted to London.  But after meeting with Mr. Seifert today, Mr. Posch said his concerns were satisfied.</p>
        <p>But critics of the merger, both in London and Frankfurt, say the plans were made hastily and glossed over many sensitive issues.</p>
        <p>There are still doubts about whether stocks listed in London will be traded in British pounds or euros, though the currency might depend on the wishes of each listed company.</p>
        <p>In general, blue-chip stocks will be traded in London under British regulations. ''Growth'' stocks, those of small, faster-growing companies, will be traded in Frankfurt under German regulations.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Seifert said there would be a third group of companies that could trade in either London or Frankfurt.</p>
        <p>''What we are about is serving the customer,'' Mr. Seifert said at a news conference this evening. But, he insisted, ''the growth market will remain here in Frankfurt.''</p>
        <p>Two members of the Deutsche Borse supervisory board have criticized the plan, worrying that Frankfurt would lose its grip on the booming market for small-capitalization growth stocks. A third member, Klaus Patig, pleaded unsuccessfully on Monday for a delay in the vote until more details could be clarified.  ''It would be a complete disaster if the merger were to fall apart,'' said Mr. Patig, who is vice chairman of the supervisory board. ''I am pleading for a pause for thought.''</p>
