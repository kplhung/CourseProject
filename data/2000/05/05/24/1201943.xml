        <p>Under pressure from farmers to open new markets, Congress is considering softening the United States trade embargo against Cuba to permit the export of food, medicine and medical products.</p>
        <p>Powerful farm groups, sensing a swing in momentum this election year, are pushing lawmakers to reconsider the 38-year-old embargo, arguing that it does more harm than good. Business groups and pharmaceutical companies are also rallying for change. The effort even got unexpected support this year from the Elian Gonzalez saga as some Americans, deluged with stories about Cuba and Cuban-Americans, began to re-evaluate whether the United States' cold war strategy toward the Communist island nation still made sense.</p>
        <p>Economically, the proposed measure is largely symbolic: It specifically rules out purchase of food using United States government credit, making it unlikely that cash-starved Cuba would be able to buy much from American farmers. And it does little to expand a current provision on exporting medicine and medical products to Cuba.</p>
        <p>The measure's true significance is political, in its newfound popularity on the Hill among both conservatives and liberals. That marks an important shift in Congress, indicating a growing impatience with the embargo's failure and a desire to explore different approaches to dealing with the government of Fidel Castro.</p>
        <p>''I think Castro has used this scapegoat argument against the United States for years,'' said Representative George R. Nethercutt Jr., a Washington Republican who faces a tough re-election battle this year. ''If we take this argument away from him, we export not only food and medicine but also democracy. He can't then say that America is inhumane. It works to our advantage. We can't do any worse.''</p>
        <p>The measure, tucked inside a mammoth agriculture spending bill, was approved by the Appropriations Committee this month. It has attracted so many allies that it withstood an attempt by the majority whip, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, to strip the measure from the larger bill.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. DeLay killed the measure before it could be voted on in the House.</p>
        <p>The provision has also cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee, and faces little opposition there, although Senator Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican and Castro foe, has expressed his displeasure. Last year, the Senate approved a similar measure in a 70-to-30 vote.</p>
        <p>Although the measure stands its best chance ever this year, it faces a few hurdles in the House, where Republican leaders could still defeat the provision by preventing an up-or-down vote on it. One hurdle, in the Rules Committee, could come as early as this week.</p>
        <p>Supporters say killing the language will be more difficult this year. ''A fundamental shift has occurred,'' said Senator Byron Dorgan, the North Dakota Republican who wrote the Senate bill.</p>
        <p>The measure would permit the United States to export food, medicine and medical products to Cuba, under certain stringent conditions, which were written into the bill to draw support.</p>
        <p>In addition to the prohibition on use of government credit, the bill also specifies that companies wanting to sell to Cuba would have to obtain yearly licenses to export their products and would have to wait six months after the law is enacted to conduct business.</p>
        <p>Medicine and medical products are already exported to Cuba under slightly tougher regulations. Last year, the Commerce Department approved 63 licenses to export medicine and medical products.</p>
        <p>Although some opponents say the language is written so loosely that it could permit bartering and private financing, many critics say the bill, if passed, would be a hollow victory for farmers.</p>
        <p>''It would really be a symbolic gesture,'' said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican and Cuban-American who is fighting the language in the bill. ''I have no problem with symbolic gestures, if that makes them happy enough, as long as they are trying not to give more money to Fidel Castro.''</p>
        <p>Farm state lawmakers argue that the measure would provide at least some help to constituents who have been hit hard by falling commodity prices and a 1996 bill that revamped agriculture rules. And it would allow farmers to position themselves in Cuba, which trades with a host of other American allies, including Canada.</p>
        <p>Audrae Erickson, an international trade specialist for the American Farm Bureau, said analysts believe that the Cuban market could be worth up to $1 billion a year.</p>
        <p>And because the provision would do little to steer money to Fidel Castro, even some members who fiercely oppose any softening of the embargo view this measure as a relatively harmless way to appease farm belt politicians.</p>
        <p>''It's all driven by the farm lobby,'' said a senior Republican Senate aide. ''These people are running around looking for any panacea. They've convinced themselves the solution lies in Havana.''</p>
        <p>In the House, the measure received extra support this year from the Elian Gonzalez story. The Elian story put Cuba back in the news and painted Cuban-Americans in Miami as extreme, creating a backlash that prompted some lawmakers to re-think American foreign policy toward Cuba.</p>
