        <p>ALTHOUGH lime is by far the most commonly used citrus in the cooking of Thailand and Southeast Asia, grapefruit and its close relative pomelo are often found in savory dishes, especially cool salads. Either adds distinctive flavor, unusual texture and an impressive amount of juice to a simple dish. And at the end of the grapefruit season, it's easier to see grapefruit as a cool refreshing centerpiece rather than a winter stopgap.</p>
        <p>In this nearly traditional salad, the grapefruit plays a leading role, complementing mild shrimp in an almost ridiculously easy dressing, comprising nothing more than nam pla (fish sauce) or soy sauce, lime juice, a bit of sugar and some water.</p>

        <p>ALTHOUGH lime is by far the most commonly used citrus in the cooking of Thailand and Southeast Asia, grapefruit and its close relative pomelo are often found in savory dishes, especially cool salads. Either adds distinctive flavor, unusual texture and an impressive amount of juice to a simple dish. And at the end of the grapefruit season, it's easier to see grapefruit as a cool refreshing centerpiece rather than a winter stopgap.</p>
        <p>In this nearly traditional salad, the grapefruit plays a leading role, complementing mild shrimp in an almost ridiculously easy dressing, comprising nothing more than nam pla (fish sauce) or soy sauce, lime juice, a bit of sugar and some water.</p>
        <p>Yet, this is by no means a tame dish. Like many Thai preparations, it potentially includes just about every basic flavor and texture, but does so without muddying any of them. Mint and cilantro add high herbal notes (either can be omitted, but the combination is great). Chilies or hot red pepper flakes bring heat. And for crunch, I like to add chopped peanuts, salted or not.</p>
        <p>This is such a high-flavored salad that you have two choices for cooking the shrimp. You can grill it and make it the star of the show. Or you can poach it and allow it to play a major but not dominant role. I usually choose the latter, since it's less work and there is already plenty of flavor here.</p>
        <p>Just be sure to use good shrimp -- Pacific or Gulf whites are the best, though the less expensive and widely available tiger shrimp are acceptable -- and buy them big, so you'll have fewer to peel. If you trust your fishmonger, you can buy cooked, peeled shrimp.</p>
        <p>As for the grapefruit, the best way to retain its juices is to peel and section it as you would an orange, not cut it in half and scoop out the flesh.</p>
        <p>SOUTHEAST ASIAN SHRIMP AND GRAPEFRUIT SALAD  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1 to 1 1/2 pounds shrimp  Salt  3 tablespoons nam pla (fish sauce) or soy sauce  1 tablespoon sugar  Juice of 2 limes  6 cups lettuce or mesclun, washed and dried  2 grapefruit, peeled and sectioned, tough white pith removed, each section cut in half</p>
        <p>1/4 cup chopped mint</p>
        <p>1/4 cup chopped cilantro  Minced chilies or dried red pepper flakes, optional</p>
        <p>1/2 cup chopped dry-roasted peanuts, optional.</p>
        <p>1. Put shrimp in a saucepan with salted water to cover; bring to a boil, then turn off heat and let sit for 5 minutes, or until shrimp are opaque in center. (Alternatively, grill or saute, sprinkling shrimp with salt as they cook.) Cool in refrigerator or under cold running water, then peel (and devein if you like). Cut shrimp in half if they're large.</p>
        <p>2. Combine nam pla or soy sauce with 2 tablespoons water, sugar and lime juice, and blend or whisk until smooth.</p>
        <p>3. Arrange the lettuce on 4 plates; top each portion with a few grapefruit pieces, some shrimp, and the mint and cilantro; drizzle with the dressing, then sprinkle with a little of the minced chilies and chopped peanuts if you like, or pass them at the table.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
