        <p>Five years ago, the Energy Department, trying to protect workers who raised safety concerns at its nuclear weapons plants, said it would stop covering the legal bills of its contractors when they were caught retaliating against such whistle-blowers.</p>
        <p>But witnesses and lawmakers said at a Congressional hearing today that the department was still paying those bills, sometimes without knowing it.</p>
        <p>Even though the department announced a policy of ''zero tolerance for reprisals'' against whistle-blowing employees years ago, department officials acknowledged today that they had not written a final rule on when to withhold taxpayer dollars from financing contractors' legal defenses against such claims.</p>
        <p>Employees of contractors, from pipefitters to senior engineers, who have called attention to on-site safety concerns, have spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees over the years, often while enduring hostile conditions at work, or unemployment, their advocates say.</p>
        <p>In a hearing by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Representative Diana DeGette, a Colorado Democrat and a former labor lawyer, said the agency should praise ''the enormous courage and unmeasurable contributions of whistle-blowers.'' Instead, Ms. DeGette said, ''They can just bleed these poor individuals dry.''</p>
        <p>The subcommittee chairman, Representative Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, said the department appeared to be ''providing virtually no support for the whistle-blowers, while providing generous taxpayer support to the contractors fighting these meritorious claims.''</p>
        <p>The Commerce Committee chairman, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia, released two agency documents on legal costs incurred by Kaiser-Hill, a contractor at Rocky Flats, a defunct plutonium plant near Denver.</p>
        <p>The contractor was defending itself against accusations that it retaliated against a security supervisor who complained about the safety of bomb fuel stored there. The employee brought his case before the Labor Department, which ruled in his favor, and Kaiser-Hill did not appeal.</p>
        <p>Among Energy Department repayments to Kaiser-Hill was $220,000 in legal fees incurred fighting the whistle-blower, Mr. Bliley said.</p>
        <p>The agency said last week it had not approved any expenses and was still reviewing them. But today it said Kaiser-Hill included the costs ''in general subcontractor billings that were not conspicuous to D.O.E.''</p>
        <p>The company has returned the money but is still seeking reimbursement, the department said.</p>
        <p>The department does nearly all of its work through contractors, many on a ''cost-plus'' basis, in which it reimburses all costs and then adds a profit. It includes legal defense costs and, usually, the cost of any settlements imposed on the contractors.</p>
        <p>Department officials said today that they could decline to make such reimbursements, but they could not cite a case where they had done so. Mary Anne Sullivan, the department's general counsel, said the agency had proposed to do so in some pending cases.</p>
        <p>One witness, Tom Carpenter, of the Government Accountability Project, which brings cases on behalf of whistle-blowers, said the system encouraged contractors to drag out cases and then settle on the eve of trial. A policy of full reimbursement was ''an incentive for the contractors to litigate the case,'' Mr. Carpenter said. ''If they had to pay, they'd have a much more realistic view'' of the cases against them.</p>
        <p>Whistle-blowers complaining of retaliation take their cases to the Labor Department, Mr. Carpenter said, because its procedures allow for discovery, access to documents and company officials, whereas Energy Department procedures do not.</p>
