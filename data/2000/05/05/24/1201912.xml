        <p>Gray skies, gray people, oppressive marriage laws: don't you just want to get away from it all? So might a travel agent make his pitch to the citizens of ancient Athens, or the version of that place that shows up in the Royal Shakespeare Company's doggedly enthusiastic new interpretation of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' and surely he would have takers.</p>
        <p>It may officially be the vernal season, but it is snowing in Athens in the opening scenes of this touring production, which runs through Saturday at the Howard Gilman Opera House of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The Athenians themselves, clad in a rainbow of shades of black, tend to keep their long overcoats buttoned, their postures ramrod straight and their faces grim.</p>
        <p>Ah, for just a little horizontal time in the sun, or barring that, a very bright moon. And to find it, all that's required is a short trip into those enchanted woods outside of town where the inhabitants are, to put it mildly, in touch with their bodies. Soon enough, everybody's going to feel the urge to strip down and dance.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers feeling trapped in a wet urban spring may sympathize with the urges to escape that are so clearly telegraphed at the beginning of the director Michael Boyd's take on Shakespeare's vision of love as a labyrinth. Whether in the succeeding scenes they'll feel they have found paradise or just a singles resort that specializes in magic tricks is another matter.</p>
        <p>This very athletic ''Dream,'' the third and final offering of the troupe's visit to the academy, was much admired in London for its unabashed bawdiness. It's true that no opportunity for the physical representation of anatomical puns is left unexplored, or that there is even the slightest doubt as to what Bottom and Titania are up to in that airborne bower of hers.</p>
        <p>No dainty treading or gently sung lullabies for these sprites. They move with a thudding step and a legs-apart gait that is a walking carnal invitation, and they dance like a martial arts class. They're like primal sex therapy instructors, determined to drag out the id that is cowering within.</p>
        <p>Yet while this ''Dream'' is emphatically sexual, it is not particularly sensual. Mr. Boyd and his company have provided a bold, baldly comic interpretation that makes landing punch lines, whether literal or implicit, its first priority. The shadows in Shakespeare's erotic forest are acknowledged only with brusque nods.</p>
        <p>The show never leaves you perplexed as to why a given situation is meant to be funny. On the other hand, it doesn't let you get to know the characters in ways that might give that humor more unsettling echoes. Though commendably clear of diction and purpose, this ''Dream'' is unlikely to linger in your own nocturnal reveries.</p>
        <p>Where the production is strongest is in its self-delight with its imaginative stagecraft. At its best, this ''Dream'' becomes a love song (albeit a loudly chanted one) to the transforming powers of theater. The pristine white set (by Tom Piper) brings to mind Peter Brook's landmark ''Dream'' of 1970, as do the comic acrobatics of the players, and there has clearly been an attempt to recapture some of that same cobweb-sweeping spirit of liberation.</p>
        <p>The production comes closest to achieving this goal not in its pelvis-centered depictions of lust but in its moments of transformation from one state of being to another. There is a charming scene early on in which Nick Bottom (Daniel Ryan), anticipating the play-within-the-play in which he is to perform, tries out different voices (for example, Sean Connery as 007) for the line ''Hold and cut bowstrings.''</p>
        <p>Suddenly, to Bottom's astonishment, an arrow appears through the wall. It's an evocative gimmick, a metaphor for what a player's passion can summon from the air, and a fitting prelude to what immediately follows. A field of red poppies works its way through the floor, and two overcoated, bespectacled Athenians emerge to pick flowers.</p>
        <p>Soon enough, their hormones are very much in evidence and their clothes in tatters, and these repressed-seeming individuals have been transformed into the fairy Peaseblossom (Sirine Saba) and her better-known male equivalent, Puck (Aidan McArdle). No, I don't think we're in Athens any more.</p>
        <p>That's pretty much the show's high point until its conclusion, when those clunky tradesmen take over to perform their version of ''Pyramus and Thisbe.'' In between is the by-now standard frenzy of lusting and skirmishing in both fairy and mortal worlds. Nicholas Jones and Josette Simon are Oberon and Titania (doubling, in what has become a convention since Mr. Brook's production, as Theseus and Hippolyta), and Catherine Kanter, Fergus O'Donnell, Henry Ian Cusick and Hermione Gulliford are the squabbling human lovers.</p>
        <p>Everyone attends to their tasks with great energy, if not much in the way of detailed personality, and some outrageous gymnastics, including a quarrel scene in which the scorned Hermia (Ms. Kanter) is literally flipped into the air and out of sight. Ultimately, Mr. Piper's costumes, with their sweeping colored linings (for the fairies) and degeneration into tatters (for the mortals), tell you more about the characters than the actors ever do.</p>
