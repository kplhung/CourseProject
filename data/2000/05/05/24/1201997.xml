        <p>The Board of Education member who is leading its effort to integrate the Internet  into the classroom is also the co-chairman and a significant stockholder of a new company trying out an Internet test-coaching program in more than two dozen New York City public schools.</p>
        <p>Irving S. Hamer Jr., the board's Manhattan representative, is chairman of its cyberspace task force, which recently won wide attention for its proposal to set up a moneymaking Board of Education Web site and provide every public school student with a laptop computer.

        <p>The Board of Education member who is leading its effort to integrate the Internet  into the classroom is also the co-chairman and a significant stockholder of a new company trying out an Internet test-coaching program in more than two dozen New York City public schools.</p>
        <p>Irving S. Hamer Jr., the board's Manhattan representative, is chairman of its cyberspace task force, which recently won wide attention for its proposal to set up a moneymaking Board of Education Web site and provide every public school student with a laptop computer. He also works full time as a senior executive at TestU, a Manhattan company that is developing Internet-based test-preparation tutorials for students and high schools nationwide.</p>
        <p>No laws have been broken, and board officials say there is no conflict of interest in Dr. Hamer's two roles because TestU does not have any contracts with the board. Dr. Hamer said he would recuse himself from any votes on a possible contract for TestU and, if the board did seek such a contract, he would seek a waiver to continue working for TestU while a board member.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Dr. Hamer could benefit greatly if TestU is successful -- as it hopes to be -- in eventually selling its services to the city's public schools for use in the classroom. And independent ethics experts and potential competitors of TestU have raised questions about Dr. Hamer's dual roles.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer, who made a brief bid for the chancellorship several weeks ago, acknowledged that he did not fully disclose his involvement with TestU and the nature of its business to his fellow Board of Education members or to the members of the cyberspace task force, but he called that an oversight.</p>
        <p>''There was no conscious decision not to make disclosures to anybody,'' he said in an interview yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I absolutely don't think there is a conflict of interest at all,'' Dr. Hamer said. ''If the judgment is made that what we are building here at TestU is suitable for the students of New York City schools, I'll be the first person to stand up and cheer. But Irving Hamer will recuse himself from any debate or decision associated with that.''</p>
        <p>Last month, the Board of Education unanimously approved the recommendations of the cyberspace task force, including a plan to set up a revenue-generating Web site to help defray the cost of providing laptop computers to all fourth graders starting in the fall of 2001.</p>
        <p>As chairman of the task force, Dr. Hamer has significant influence over the board's planning for the use of technology in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer has filed the required disclosure forms with the Board of Education indicating that he earns an annual salary of $175,000 at TestU and owns 5 percent of the company's stock. He valued that stock at $100,000 to $250,000 on the forms, but it could be worth five times that, based on estimates of the company's worth by other recent investors.</p>
        <p>TestU's viability depends on its ability not only to sell its products to students and school systems but also to operate in schools that use computers and Internet technology. Because TestU started operations only nine months ago and is still test-marketing its tutoring services, the company says it has has no significant revenues or profits yet.</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials say that because the company does not have any contracts with the board or with individual city schools, no conflict of interest exists for Dr. Hamer.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer said he checked with the board's ethics officer and was told that he did not have to request a waiver to allow TestU to do business with the board until a contract was being considered. When and if that occurs, Dr. Hamer said, he intended to request a waiver allowing him to work for a company that does business with the board.</p>
        <p>Those who think that there is a conflict, however, include executives of two companies that TestU could compete with in trying to secure test-preparation contracts with the board. ''I think it certainly is an issue that has to be explored,'' said Marc Bernstein, president of Kaplan Learning Services of New York, a division of Kaplan Inc. that has a contract with the Board of Education for traditional test-preparation services for New York City teachers and students. ''Until a company like TestU has a clear track record that can attract customers on its own, having access to a business market is absolutely crucial.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer ''is a person in a position to provide that access,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''That certainly presents a potential interference with open business practices.''</p>
        <p>John Katzman, president of Princeton Review, a competing test-preparation company in New York, said he saw a potential conflict in Dr. Hamer's dual roles. ''I would be a lot more comfortable if they sold some other school systems on their product first, before the New York City schools,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kevin T. Jackson, an associate professor of business ethics at Fordham University and a lawyer, said that while many professions had  clear guidelines about how to deal with conflicts of interest, it was generally less clear how and when to address potential conflicts of the type faced by Dr. Hamer.</p>
        <p>''But full disclosure is a widely recognized way to remove questions about potential conflicts,'' said Dr. Jackson, particularly in what he called ''highly charged political entities'' like the Board of Education.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer's roles at the board and at TestU developed at roughly the same time. When Dr. Hamer joined the Board of Education in July 1998, he was an independent education consultant, having left a job with the educational publishing division of Simon &amp; Schuster six months earlier.</p>
        <p>At the publishing division, Dr. Hamer's responsibilities included studying the use of technology in education. Once at the board, he quickly became the expert on technology issues, William C. Thompson Jr., the board president, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>In July 1999, Mr. Thompson appointed Dr. Hamer to head the task force studying the Internet and education, and Mr. Thompson said Dr. Hamer was instrumental in raising the issue as one worthy of study.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer recruited experts from several companies, including Cisco Systems, Toshiba and I.B.M., to the task force. Mr. Thompson said each company had potential commercial interests in a plan to integrate the Internet into schools. ''But the idea was to get people who had the expertise,'' Mr. Thompson said, and to deal with potential conflicts of interest when it came time to request proposals for contracts and to issue them.</p>
        <p>In September, about the time that the task force began regular meetings, Dr. Hamer joined TestU. This spring, the company began offering a trial version of its tutorial for the SAT and the state English Regents exam to about 600 students at several high schools in Brooklyn and 23 specialized schools across the five boroughs, according to Richard Bolton, chief operating officer at TestU.</p>
        <p>The company is also testing its products in Fresno, Calif.; Nashville; Providence, R.I.; and New Bedford, Mass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bolton said neither Dr. Hamer nor Rudy Crew, the former schools chancellor who became a director of TestU after he left the chancellorship, was involved in the placement of the TestU software in New York City schools. In an interview, Dr. Crew said he would not be involved with any efforts to do business with city schools at least until conflict-of-interest barriers expire one year after his departure as chancellor.</p>
        <p>While Dr. Hamer disclosed his employment with TestU on the board's disclosure forms, those forms do not require any description of the company's business. Dr. Hamer said he did talk about the company with several other board members and none of them raised the issue of a potential conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>''I have a sense that I had been clear and straightforward in those conversations,'' Dr. Hamer said. ''But it is conceivable that because it was an external activity it was not understood as a potential conflict until now, when that is being raised.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said he knew that Dr. Hamer was working for an educational start-up company, but he did not know exactly what the company's business was. Nevertheless, Mr. Thompson said he did not see a conflict in Dr. Hamer's two roles.</p>
