        <p>BILL WALLACE counts himself one lucky guy.</p>
        <p>A fourth-generation Floridian, Mr. Wallace grew up in the semirural vastness of West Palm Beach in the late 1960's, a time when a boy with a flashlight could gig frogs before dawn and hunt doves by lunchtime within a quarter mile of his home. Alligators were no farther away.</p>
        <p>Those fields and ponds have long vanished under an asphalt and concrete carpet of condominiums and malls. What land development has not swallowed up is now largely protected by state and federal conservation, or is a public recreation area, or is fenced in by farmers, ranchers and sugar plantation owners. Game and fertile freshwater fishing areas have been pushed deeper into the Everglades or harder-to-reach boggy marshes around Lake Okeechobee, in south-central Florida.</p>
        <p>So when Mr. Wallace, now 40, wants to recreate his youthful surroundings for his friends, family and three young children, they drive 100 miles to a 21,000-acre cattle ranch northwest of Lake Okeechobee. There, on 4,000 acres that he, his brother and two friends lease for $30,000 a year, Mr. Wallace and his troops go pig hunting on monster swamp buggies among the scrub palmetto and wire grass open pastures.</p>
        <p>Pig hunting is not as elegant or as hidebound as a fox hunt, but it has its own traditions and defenders. And pigs usually serve as centerpieces for meals that are far zestier than what is served on toast points at more manicured estates.</p>
        <p>It is believed that pigs were introduced to Florida in the 16th century by Spanish explorers. Pigs are feral, nomadic animals, not protected like native game from year-round hunting. No license is needed to kill them.</p>
        <p>But the pigs have retreated to areas where they are hard to find.</p>
        <p>''Bull hogs,'' or boars, which are uncastrated male pigs, tend to have a dark, gamy flesh not appreciated by everyone. The way around this problem is to castrate a bull hog. After 18 months or so, experts say, a hog can double its weight, adding sweeter white meat as it sheds its old hormone-infused spirit.</p>
        <p>Boars, which can weigh more than 250 pounds, are also equipped with razor-sharp tusks capable of shredding anything blocking their paths. They are mean and love a fight, Mr. Wallace said on an April weekend.</p>
        <p>At the ranch, he and Bill Chancellor, 49, a rangy man who shares in the lease, could be mistaken for cowboys. Away from the ranch, Mr. Wallace is a successful personal injury lawyer in West Palm Beach and Mr. Chancellor is a businessman and investor. But they said their lives would not be complete if they could not shed their city clothes and schedules and spend at least one weekend a month at the ranch.</p>
        <p>They track boar in the daylight hours and board an airboat under a midnight moon to search for frogs in alligator-infested canals and sulfur-reeking sloughs. In between, they enjoy the regional food that is increasingly hard to find in the Sunshine State.</p>
        <p>The families hunt and fish all weekend but kill only what they will eat. That means they shoot only half a dozen wild pigs a year, Mr. Wallace said. ''For us the fun is the chase to catch a hog and release it,'' he said, adding that normally the only thing that gets hurt is a boar's pride. (But before the hog is released, he is castrated and has an ear clipped, making him easier to recognize for future hunts.)</p>
        <p>The culmination of the hunt is a swirl of noise and dust. A dog pack, in full-throated babble, flushes a 225-pound wild hog out of the thick cover of a marsh. Running hard, the boar thuds heavily across a sun-parched open field at a surprising pace for its bulk. The dogs, however, quickly gain on it.</p>
        <p>Winded after 300 yards, the boar stops abruptly and turns to face the yelping hounds, ready for a fight. Tusks clack angrily as the animal lowers its head, small red eyes blazing, waiting for the charge of the more aggressive dogs in the pack.</p>
        <p>Before much harm can be inflicted on either side, the lumbering swamp buggy bumps to a halt and several adults and teenagers leap out. They restrain the hounds as one man circles behind the distracted boar and in a quick thrust grabs its hind shanks and twists the heavy animal to the ground, where it lies snout down in the wire grass, squealing loudly but helpless.</p>
        <p>That boar lived to be chased another day. In the evening, as a scimitar moon cast a pale luminance over flat fields broken every few hundred yards by a solitary palm tree or a line of myrtle trees, the shoulder of pig on the table came from the freezer, bagged in a previous hunt.</p>
        <p>The barbecued meat and ribs swirled in a dark, smoky sauce. All of it was laid out, along with chunks of alligator tail, lightly fried in a spicy batter, and deep-fried frogs' legs. As with other formerly common and now exotic meats, the alligator and frogs' legs were sold by professional trappers and commercial froggers.</p>
        <p>On the side were freshly picked green beans and squash, sauteed in garlic butter, and hot and steaming corn on the cob and cornbread.</p>
        <p>Three or four years ago, the families erected a 20-by-14-foot pavilion under a corrugated tin roof for cooking and dining. They hauled in a prefabricated 18-by-14-foot bunkhouse.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Wallace and his wife, Ehricka, don't exactly rough it on their weekends at the ranch. They and his two children and her son sleep in their $200,000 air-conditioned American Dream motor coach.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Wallace and Mr. Chancellor drive to the ranch with their families, the caravan looks like the Florida National Guard on maneuvers. There are the two 40-foot coaches, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles trailing two monster swamp buggies on flatbed trailers, a  powerful airboat, and three all-terrain vehicles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallace does not consider himself much of a cook in a real kitchen. But he knows his way around a charcoal grill or deep fryer. About once a month at the ranch he will cook a whole pork shoulder by placing it in a Dutch oven with potatoes, onions, pepper and spices, burying it under charcoal briquettes for four hours and finally unveiling what he calls poor man's soup.</p>
        <p>''It ain't fancy,'' Mr. Wallace said, turning on a Southern argot that  doesn't surface in his weekday speech, ''but we sure got it figured out right.''</p>
        <p>The whole ritual reflects a phenomenon of the New South. Southerners constantly try to reclaim their uniqueness, and food is one way of doing it, said Prof. Irma McClaurin, a cultural anthropologist at the University of Florida. It's a way of affirming a nostalgic past even as everything changes around them.</p>
