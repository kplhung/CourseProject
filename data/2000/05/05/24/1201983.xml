        <p>They attend top high schools in the New York region and the Northeast, and, within that rarefied group, they are better-than-average students. Banking on the reputations of their schools alone, they would most likely have been snapped up by many of the top colleges they dreamed of attending -- if only they had applied three years ago.</p>
        <p>One is a New Yorker about to graduate from a storied New England boarding school who was rejected by all seven colleges to which he applied this year -- including Trinity and Tufts -- despite a College Board score in the high 1300's out of 1,600 and a B-plus average.</p>
        <p>Another attends one of the most rigorous prep schools in Manhattan, but her record -- a mix of A's and B's and a College Board score in the mid-1200's -- earned only one acceptance, at Tulane.</p>
        <p>A third had a straight-A average at a public high school in one of Long Island's wealthiest communities, a College Board score of nearly 1400, and extensive volunteer work with the homeless and disabled, but she was rejected outright, in an early round, by the University of Pennsylvania. She then applied to only one other institution, of less cachet, and was immediately accepted.</p>
        <p>Though the sting of this exceptionally competitive college admissions season was felt in homes across the country, it has often been sharpest in New York, New Jersey and around New England -- particularly at high schools so well known that their names alone once provided all the necessary collateral for even a middling applicant to secure a good spot.</p>
        <p>In part, those students most disappointed in the results of their college quests this year were victims of a simple numbers problem: applications at places like Harvard, Columbia and Middlebury are up, but not necessarily the number of seats.</p>
        <p>But with the nation's students now able to visit, and apply to, virtually any college with the click of a mouse, more applications are streaming into the most prestigious Northeastern universities from the Midwest, West and South. This is a welcome rain for colleges looking to broaden their ''geographical diversity,'' but sometimes it comes at the expense of longtime feeder schools in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>''There were certainly schools that were easier for our students to get into a year ago that are more difficult now,'' said Carol Katz, the college adviser at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, one of the best public high schools in the country.</p>
        <p>''Are there more disappointments this year?'' Ms. Katz added. ''Yes. What we once thought was a safe school is no longer a good bet. And what we once thought was a good bet has become more of a long shot.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Katz, like her colleagues elsewhere, would speak only in the blandest generalities about a process that gives so many students and parents so many sleepless nights. Other advisers would relay their stories only on the condition of anonymity (theirs and their students'), given the high emotions involved.</p>
        <p>Frank C. Leana, an education counselor and the former director of college counseling at Trinity School on the Upper West Side, said that the process had become ''a little more pressurized for Manhattanites.''</p>
        <p>''When given a choice among equally qualified applicants, these colleges are more likely to pull in that kid from North Dakota or the remote part of upstate New York than from the densely populated, highly qualified New York City pool,'' he said. ''It's just a different ballgame.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, such hand-wringing is as regular a part of each spring as the emergence of the crocuses, because even the most skilled counselors are routinely stymied by their attempts to outthink a process that is, at its root, often arbitrary, with more than 10 students applying for each seat in the freshman class at some institutions.</p>
        <p>Moreover, some New York-area high schools detected little dip in their college tallies this year.</p>
        <p>Montclair High School in Montclair, N.J., for example, reported that its students had fared better in the admissions race this year than last, at least as measured by the 11 students, out of a graduating class of 350, bound for Ivy League colleges.</p>
        <p>But there is no denying that the competition from within New York State alone, which often fills more spots than any other state at top colleges, has tightened in recent years.</p>
        <p>Consider that the 2,900 applications submitted to Columbia University by New York State students this year represent an increase of 53 percent since 1997. And, in a finite game of musical chairs, those New York students are being pitted not only against one another but also against more applicants from around the country and the world, who have become convinced that admission to a top college guarantees nothing less than success in later life.</p>
        <p>It is telling that Carol Gill, a college counselor in Westchester County whose client base once extended no farther than the 10-mile radius centered on Dobbs Ferry, now regularly consults with families in Louisville and Cleveland as well as Athens and London.</p>
        <p>''They have an easier time of it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Sandy Bass, the editor and publisher of The Private School Insider, a monthly newsletter that reports on schools in the metropolitan region, says that some New York students whose egos have been battered by Northeastern colleges have wound up looking farther from home than their predecessors did -- often to universities like Emory in Atlanta and Vanderbilt in Tennessee, which, however well regarded, are not the applicants' first choices.</p>
        <p>''The point being made,'' Ms. Bass said, ''is that you just can't say anymore, 'This is my safe school.' You have to want to go to all of the schools.''</p>
