        <p>A day after withdrawing his name for consideration for the Washington Wizards' head coaching job, St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said yesterday that the only college coaching job he wanted was the one he had despite a statement attributed to his agent late Monday that Jarvis was ''considering a major college coaching position in the Big Ten.''</p>
        <p>Jarvis issued a statement disputing remarks attributed to his agent, Robert Ades, by The Associated Press that, besides considering a couple of other National Basketball Association possibilities, his client was interested in an unnamed Big Ten school that was a ''step up from St. John's in terms of stature.''</p>

        <p>A day after withdrawing his name for consideration for the Washington Wizards' head coaching job, St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said yesterday that the only college coaching job he wanted was the one he had despite a statement attributed to his agent late Monday that Jarvis was ''considering a major college coaching position in the Big Ten.''</p>
        <p>Jarvis issued a statement disputing remarks attributed to his agent, Robert Ades, by The Associated Press that, besides considering a couple of other National Basketball Association possibilities, his client was interested in an unnamed Big Ten school that was a ''step up from St. John's in terms of stature.''</p>
        <p>''Anything that is said, in regards to any job regarding Mike Jarvis, will be made by me and only me,'' Jarvis said in a statement released by the university. ''The statements that are attributed to Rob Ades are false and inaccurate.''</p>
        <p>Ades told The Associated Press yesterday that he had not spoken to the news agency at all. The report, the news agency said, was based on a telephone call with a person who identified himself as Ades to an Associated Press sports reporter. The news agency said last night that it was checking the source of the call.</p>
        <p>In his statement, Jarvis added: ''I have said on numerous occasions, and I will say it for the last time, that I have no interest in any other college coaching job and I have not changed my mind. I feel I have the best college job in America, bar none, because of the fact that I'm at St. John's University and I'm in New York -- the greatest city in the world.''</p>
        <p>Jarvis stepped away from the negotiating table with the Wizards Monday after talks between Ades and Michael Jordan, Washington's president of basketball operations, stalled, apparently over money and decision-making power.</p>
        <p>Jarvis, who coached at George Washington for eight years, was believed to be seeking a deal worth $3 million a year -- or more than $1 million over what the Wizards had offered.</p>
        <p>The St. John's coach acknowledged that he and Jordan had not been able to come up with an agreement and said that he intended to turn his full ''attention and energy'' to preparing for the Red Storm's upcoming season.</p>
        <p>Jarvis has led the Red Storm to a 53-17 record and consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association berths in his two years at St. John's. He has consistently expressed interest in the N.B.A. and did so again yesterday.</p>
        <p>''The day may come when I leave to coach in the N.B.A. and I've been consistent in my statements regarding those aspirations as well -- but until that time comes I'm the head coach at St. John's University and I look forward to the upcoming season with great anticipation.''</p>
        <p>University administrators have insisted they have been kept abreast of Jarvis's job opportunities and said they stood behind their coach.</p>
        <p>''Mike has always been upfront and honest about what his ambitions are,'' Ed Manetta Jr., St. John's athletic director, said. ''He's been consistent in delivering that message to me. I'm behind him 100 percent, and now it's time to move on from this issue.''</p>
