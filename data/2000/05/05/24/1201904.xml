        <p>JOHN LLOYD has decided to stop pretending. He works out of his home, in a room just off the kitchen, and for seven years he was scrupulous about sounding as if he was at a ''real'' office. His two young sons learned to tiptoe and whisper. His wife, a professional musician, knew not to practice her bassoon. His clients (he works as a fund-raising consultant to nonprofit groups) never knew his family was there.</p>
        <p>After spending endless energy to erase the background noise, Mr. Lloyd had a most unlikely epiphany. Walking into a men's room in a library a few months ago, he heard someone conducting a business call while inside a stall. If the world was ready for that, he reasoned, it could handle the occasional squeak or squawk from his children. So, he went home and, literally and metaphorically, opened his office door.</p>

        <p>JOHN LLOYD has decided to stop pretending. He works out of his home, in a room just off the kitchen, and for seven years he was scrupulous about sounding as if he was at a ''real'' office. His two young sons learned to tiptoe and whisper. His wife, a professional musician, knew not to practice her bassoon. His clients (he works as a fund-raising consultant to nonprofit groups) never knew his family was there.</p>
        <p>After spending endless energy to erase the background noise, Mr. Lloyd had a most unlikely epiphany. Walking into a men's room in a library a few months ago, he heard someone conducting a business call while inside a stall. If the world was ready for that, he reasoned, it could handle the occasional squeak or squawk from his children. So, he went home and, literally and metaphorically, opened his office door.</p>
        <p>''It's all about what noise is O.K. noise,'' he said. ''All those people who walk down the street next to construction cranes talking on their cell phones -- that's O.K.? And me, talking on my office phone with kids in the background -- that's not O.K.? I reject the argument that there's a difference.''</p>
        <p>What then, is the difference? Why has it become acceptable to announce where you're calling from -- inside the airplane, stuck in traffic, at the snack bar at Yankee Stadium at the top of the ninth ''but I wanted to get back to you right away'' -- as long as the place you're calling from is not your house? My most memorable interview was with an Internet chief executive who spoke, with surprising clarity, from the dentist's chair. He was more than happy to tell me where he was and what type of periodontal work he was having. My husband once sat in the waiting area of our local emergency room, stanching the bleeding from his nose with one hand and fielding phone calls from his office with the other. He felt no need to hide where he was, either.</p>
        <p>But at home, nonoffice noise takes on a whole new meaning. The ring of the doorbell, the roar of the lawn mower: they all seem to scream ''she's really just working from home.'' And then there are the top notes added by children. I picked up the phone to make a call a while back and found that my younger son was already on the line, talking to a very surprised Christine Todd Whitman, whom I was profiling for a magazine article. Of course, it could have been worse. A friend's son once beat her to a call from an important client and told him, ''Mommy's downstairs, and I'm on the potty so I can't go get her.''</p>
        <p>The client took it surprisingly well. So did the governor, and we went on to have a charming conversation about her own children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lloyd has had success with his new open-door policy, too. He has had one negative reaction -- a caller who bristled when he put her on hold to check on a crying child -- but it didn't lead him to close his door. Instead, he decided that he and the caller, a potential employer, would not be a good business match.</p>
        <p>Before you turn up the television and run the vacuum cleaner during your next business call, a word of caution from Jennifer Johnson, who is as strong an advocate as there is for working from home. Ms. Johnson is the founder of Johnson &amp; Company, a ''virtual'' public relations agency whose 20 employees work in home offices across four time zones. One day it won't matter if the doorbell rings, she promises, but for the moment it still does. She requires her staff to have a separate phone line just for work and someone else to watch the children during designated business hours.</p>
        <p>She also draws a line between ''high stakes'' and ''low stakes'' calls. Company staff meetings (by way of conference call) are ''low stakes,'' the aural equivalent of casual days in bricks-and-mortar offices, and often include dogs barking, babies crying and treadmills humming. Calls to clients are quieter, a better-dressed version of background noise, and Ms. Johnson has given out signs that can be put on the front door during these conversations.</p>
        <p>''Danger, WORK IN PROGRESS,'' they say, ''Unless an absolute emergency, please leave packages. Do not ring doorbell.''</p>
