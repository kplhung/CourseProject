        <p>The House opened a spirited debate today on the China trade bill, as a furious final round of horse-trading with undecided members demanding everything from gas pipelines to a weather station left supporters confident that they would eke out a victory on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Republican and Democratic vote counters in favor of the bill said they were within a vote or two of their targets needed to grant Beijing permanent normal trading relations and give President Clinton a crowning foreign policy triumph. About a dozen Democrats, including six Texans, announced their support.</p>
        <p>But opponents insisted that the margin was still too close to call, and that the spotlight had swung from undeclared Democrats to about 10 undeclared Republicans, who were receiving a wave of phone calls from veterans groups and human rights advocates. Many in both camps predicted that the vote could go down to the wire.</p>
        <p>''I expect the bill to pass, but it's going to be one of the most exciting 15 to 20 minutes on the floor,'' said Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, who is a supporter of the measure.</p>
        <p>In the debate that opened this afternoon and will resume on Wednesday, supporters like Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, urged passage for economic and foreign policy reasons: ''This will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and enhance our national security.'' [Excerpts from the debate, Page A14.]</p>
        <p>Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat who brokered an amendment to the trade measure that creates a human rights monitoring commission in China, said: ''China's integration into the world trading system inevitably presents opportunies and challenges. We have to take advantage of benefits we negotiated with China and actively address our problems.''</p>
        <p>But foes, including Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, argued that passage would lead to multinational corporations ''setting up low-wage sweatshops and dumping their pollution'' in China.</p>
        <p>Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, said replacing Congress's annual renewal of China's trade status with permanently lower tariffs would strip lawmakers of their leverage to curb China's repression of its own people. ''There are 10 million people in slave-labor camps who have nothing more than a bowl of gruel a day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>From the White House to Capitol Hill, both sides fanned out to intensify their lobbying. Mr. Clinton met with several wavering Democrats, and he and his cabinet members telephoned several more uncommitted lawmakers.</p>
        <p>''We can try to move China in the right direction, and gain the benefits, or we can push China in the wrong direction and pay the price,'' Mr. Clinton said today in a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert.</p>
        <p>Scores of union workers, environmental activists and human rights advocates, who attacked China as a Communist regime that flouts Western labor and environmental standards, rallied on the steps of the Capitol to oppose rewarding Beijing with a trade plum.</p>
        <p>Many held placards reading, ''No Blank Check for China,'' and ''880,000 Jobs to China -- Could Yours be Next?'' Harry Wu, a prominent human rights advocate and opponent of the measure, drew huge cheers when he declared to the crowd, ''Vote your conscience, not just for profit.''</p>
        <p>But the White House and its backers were pulling out all the stops. In a move timed in part to sway a handful of Hispanic and black lawmakers, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert announced a set of tax breaks and public investments aimed at helping distressed rural and urban areas.</p>
        <p>At least three previously uncommitted Democrats, Ruben Hinojosa of Texas, Sheila Jackson-Lee of Texas and Gregory W. Meeks of New York, said the tax breaks made it easier for them to announce their support today.</p>
        <p>White House officials were locked in discussion with a number of Democrats over deals that have little to do with the vote on China trade.</p>
        <p>Though administration officials insist the pork-barrel politics are far less intense than during a close vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement six years ago, the vote has prompted perhaps a dozen members to take up unrelated matters with the president and the House leadership, although most insisted that the requests were not quid pro quos.</p>
        <p>The Texas delegation has been especially active. One big victor appears to be Representative Martin Frost. Mr. Frost, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, had been pressing the administration for help in avoiding the closure of a Northrop Grumman Corp. defense plant in Grand Prairie, Tex. The plant is the single largest employer in Mr. Frost's district.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frost declared that he would vote yes today after Northrop Grumman indicated to its own employees that it would remain in Grand Prairie. The company said it had received assurances from the Navy that it would receive sufficient business to justify keeping the plant open, an aide to Mr. Frost said.</p>
        <p>Two other members of the Texas delegation also tipped their hands after negotiating unrelated local-district matters with the White House. Representatives Silvestre Reyes and Solomon P. Ortiz had been pressing the administration to help arrange a waiver from Environmental Protection Agency regulations to allow the construction of a gas pipeline in western Texas.</p>
        <p>Congressional aides said both members declared that they would vote yes after receiving signals from the administration that the matter would be dealt with shortly. The aides said the White House did not make a firm commitment that the waiver would be granted, however.</p>
        <p>Representative Robert E. Cramer of Alabama, another Democrat, said he would favor the bill after he held discussions with Commerce Secretary William M. Daley over the fate of a National Weather Service monitoring station in Huntsville. The weather service, which is part of the Commerce Department, had indicated that it planned to close the weather tower. Mr. Cramer had been protesting the planned closure because his district often has tornadoes and relies on the weather stations for early warnings.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Cramer said today that Mr. Daley had promised to decide the fate of the weather tower shortly and that Mr. Cramer was satisfied it would be dealt with properly. But the aide said Mr. Cramer had not received a firm commitment to keep the tower operational.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said that as the vote approached, they had the support of 68 Democrats in the House, just shy of the baseline goal of 70 they had targeted months ago. Republican vote counters said tonight that they had 148 firm yes votes, two short of their target, and were still hoping to recruit as many as eight more Republicans still undecided.</p>
        <p>''One fear I have is that people will say, 'They have all the votes they need,' and could cause it to go down,'' said Representative David Dreier of California, a Republican vote counter who favors the measure.</p>
        <p>But opponents claimed that the race was effectively even. One opposition vote counter said that the administration and the opposition could each count on 210 votes. That meant that the White House needed at least eight more supporters to assure passage.</p>
        <p>The Democrats who declared that they would vote yes included six from the Texas delegation: Representatives Reyes, Ortiz, Frost, Jackson-Lee, Hinojosa and Jim Turner.</p>
        <p>Others who said today they would vote yes were Allen Boyd of Florida and Mike Thompson of California.</p>
        <p>White House officials said that they might pick up several more votes, but that pressure was now on the Republican caucus to achieve at least 148 supporters.</p>
        <p>A surprisingly large number of Republicans remained officially undecided, and opponents claimed five successes in recruiting no votes in the caucus: J. D. Hayworth of Arizona, Howard Coble of North Carolina, Lamar Smith of Texas, Michael A. Collins of Georgia and Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>Many of the Republicans who said they would vote no said they would do so because they felt that it was not in the national security interest of the United States to grant China higher trade status. Mr. Smith and Mr. Collins had been expected by many vote counters to vote in favor.</p>
        <p>John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said today that he was focusing much of his lobbying effort in the final hours on the undecided Republicans.</p>
        <p>''I am meeting with a number of conservative Republicans that we haven't worked together with on many issues in the past,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''We hope to convince them to vote the right way.''</p>
