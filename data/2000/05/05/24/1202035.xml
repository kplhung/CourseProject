        <p>Much of the CBS conference call centered on the network's forthcoming ventures into what has been described as televoyeurism, the two summer shows ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>''Survivor'' begins a week from today at 8 p.m., where it will run for 13 weeks. Mr. Moonves repeated several times that this is ''summer programming.'</p>
        <p>But if that was an attempt to lower expectations for the show's performance, he did express high enthusiasm for the show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves said he found the format on ''Survivor,'' in which 16 people are thrown together on a desert island blanketed with cameras off the coast of Borneo, ''totally fascinating.'' He said the idea of following which cast members pair up, who had conflicts and how they do or don't work together was ''full of surprises.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves said CBS already had plans to bring ''Survivor'' back during the regular season if it proved to be a hit. He said a new round of ''Survivor'' could be ready as early as January.</p>
        <p>In July CBS will begin running 90 episodes of ''Big Brother,'' which throws ordinary people together in a house full of cameras. Again, Mr. Moonves emphasized that this was summer programming intended to take advantage of repeats on the other networks. But he also pointed out that the show has been a phenomenon in the Netherlands and Spain, where it has ended, and in Germany, where it is still running.  As of last week, the show had tripled its audience in Germany, he said.</p>
        <p>If ''Big Brother'' becomes any kind of phenomenon here, it may set up an interesting challenge to the Olympics on NBC. Its finale -- in which one winner walks out of the house with $500,000 -- will be among the few original shows to try to take on a night of the Olympics.</p>
