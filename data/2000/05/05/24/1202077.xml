        <p>The Knicks treated Reggie Miller's comments concerning his distaste for their team like background noise today. Mostly, they ignored the Pacers' loquacious guard.</p>
        <p>''That's all Reggie does is talk,'' Larry Johnson said today before the Knicks played the Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. ''Reggie probably wants to play New York so bad it's pitiful. In the four years since I've been here, that's all he does is talk, talk, talk, talk.''</p>

        <p>The Knicks treated Reggie Miller's comments concerning his distaste for their team like background noise today. Mostly, they ignored the Pacers' loquacious guard.</p>
        <p>''That's all Reggie does is talk,'' Larry Johnson said today before the Knicks played the Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. ''Reggie probably wants to play New York so bad it's pitiful. In the four years since I've been here, that's all he does is talk, talk, talk, talk.''</p>
        <p>Among the remarks Miller made on Monday, he said the Knicks ''think they're bigger and badder than everyone and don't want to give anyone respect.''</p>
        <p>In response, Latrell Sprewell dismissed Miller's verbal barrage as nonsense and said the Knicks had a great deal of respect for the Pacers.</p>
        <p>''I'm here to play; I'm not here to talk,'' Sprewell said. ''We're just here to win. I don't care about respect and hate and all of that. Go out and play. They can do all the talking they want. I'm here to play.</p>
        <p>''I love Chris Mullin. I respect Larry Bird. I do think there is a certain amount of respect for the players. I don't care what Reggie said. He has to respect us like we respect him.''</p>
        <p>Time to Move On</p>
        <p>After hearing the Heat complain about the officiating in Game 7, and then listening as the Pacers sympathized with the Heat -- citing a call last year in Game 3 that led to Larry Johnson's 4-point play -- the Knicks were a little insulted.</p>
        <p>''They have to let it go,'' Larry Johnson said, referring to the Pacers' suspicions about his 4-point play, which occurred when Antonio Davis fouled him on a 3-pointer in the final seconds. ''It bothers me to hear them say it wasn't a foul or it wasn't this or that. It was a heck of a play. Antonio said I hit a heck of a shot.''</p>
