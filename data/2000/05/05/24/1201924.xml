        <p>THE idea of drinking something as big and sweet as a port or moscato after a meal has about as much appeal to me as eating beef stew for breakfast.

        <p>THE idea of drinking something as big and sweet as a port or moscato after a meal has about as much appeal to me as eating beef stew for breakfast. It is not so much the flavor of these after-dinner drinks that offends, but the sensation of a heavy syrup weighing down on my dulled palate.</p>
        <p>But a sake caught my eye recently on a listing of dessert wines at Thalia. Compared with the other drinks on the list, the sake, Hanahato Kijoshu, glimmered.</p>
        <p>The bartender delivered a tall stemmed glass filled with an amber liquid. I smelled it. Marsala, I thought. Then I gave it another try, cooling my pessimism. Its aromas rolled out. I got a barreling waft of almond milk and banana, like a roar from a mouse.</p>
        <p>The sake, aged eight years in French oak, is served chilled. It is pleasantly cool on the tongue. What's remarkable about it, though, is its ability to provide all that dessert wines do -- soft, satiny liquor with a deep sweetness -- without being cloying. And more than that, its flavor evolves with each sip, transforming from a custardy essence to cooked fruit. The only disappointment is its finish: it is so clean and thin that it fades all too quickly, like twilight.</p>
        <p>AMANDA HESSER</p>
        <p>Hanahato Kijoshu sake is $20 a glass at Thalia, 828 Eighth Avenue (50th Street), (212) 399-4444.</p>
