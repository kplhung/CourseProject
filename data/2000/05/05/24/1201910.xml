        <p>In the paternalistic spirit of Victorian England, Lord Palmerston believed that the general public could be inspired to ''noble actions'' and ''good conduct'' if allowed to study the features of ''those who have done things worthy of our admiration.'' So, with this uplifting thought, he used his authority as prime minister to approve a small grant for the creation of a National Portrait Gallery in London.</p>
        <p>Alas, the moralizing power of portraiture was never tested. Unconvinced that viewing oils of monarchs, statesmen, generals and writers could improve anyone's behavior, the new museum's trustees saw no reason to exclude famous men and women who had exhibited ''great faults and errors'' along with some commendable qualities. They also decided that, when buying portraits, they would ''look to the celebrity of the person represented rather than to the merit of the artist.''</p>
        <p>The gallery struggled to find a permanent home, wandering London for four decades before it finally settled in 1896 in St. Martin's Place, off Trafalgar Square. The building was unimposing, upstaged in size and elegance by the neighboring National Gallery, but its collection grew steadily until it could boast an impressive visual archive of the crucial players in British history and culture since the late 15th century.</p>
        <p>But few Londoners knew of its existence. Then, in 1969, the gallery dropped its requirement that all but reigning sovereigns and their consorts be dead for 10 years before their features could be admired on its walls. And suddenly, instead of always looking back, the museum could now look around, which prompted it to accept photographic portraits and to start commissioning painted portraits. The creation of an annual BP Portrait Award in the early 1980's further encouraged the genre. And the public responded.</p>
        <p>In an age in which figurative painting was seemingly fighting for its life, annual attendance at the portrait gallery grew quickly, reaching one million in 1994. In 1997 the gallery obtained a $17.8 million grant from proceeds from a new national lottery to build an annex. This month Queen Elizabeth opened a wing named after Christopher Ondaatje, a businessman who made the largest private contribution to the $24 million total cost.</p>
        <p>With 50 percent more public and exhibition space, the National Portrait Gallery has taken on the interesting challenge of how to balance history and the present day.</p>
        <p>As much as awakening interest in portraiture, the museum has in recent years been cashing in on the British public's fascination with instant celebrities, itself a product of the rule of tabloids, television, movies, rock music and soccer mania. Understandably, perhaps, in a museum world increasingly addicted to attendance figures, it proved hard to resist what one trustee called ''ephemeral fashionability.'' With a television star preferred any day over a worthy politician, the gallery veered towards the voyeurist appeal of a Madame Tussaud's.</p>
        <p>Its old physical layout contributed to this impression. Visitors entering from the street would arrive immediately at the most topical displays, ignoring hundreds of whiskered portraits spread over two floors. ''After the first floor opened in late 1993, the focus switched too much from the historical to the contemporary,'' said Charles Saumarez Smith, who became the gallery's director in 1994. ''All the liveliness was on the first floor. Only 20 percent of visitors got to the top floor.''</p>
        <p>The adroitness of the Ondaatje Wing, then, is that it has automatically altered the way the public moves through the museum. The work of Sir Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones, whose practice also designed the ''new'' Royal Opera House, the wing occupies a courtyard tucked between the museum and the National Gallery and provides a large, naturally lighted entrance foyer. From there an escalator leads directly to the third floor, where, almost unawares, visitors find themselves embarking on a voyage through British history.</p>
        <p>The splendid Tudor Gallery, which opens with portraits of Richard III and his conqueror in the Battle of Bosworth of 1485, Henry VII, is itself one of the new exhibition spaces created by the expansion, with portraits hanging on deep gray walls and spotlighted with fiber-optic lights. Beyond a portrait of Shakespeare, the very first acquired by the gallery in 1856, rooms lead through centuries of British monarchs and assorted luminaries, with literary and artistic genius competing remarkably well with military and imperialistic prowess.</p>
        <p>The Balcony Gallery, also new, carries the chronology into near-history, with photographs and oils of people whose fame has lasted longer than 15 minutes, from Margaret Thatcher and Joan Collins to Sir Isaiah Berlin and Mick Jagger. And, as before, the first floor is dedicated to many newer celebrities as well as to temporary exhibitions, with a show of portraits and photographs by Lord Snowdon running through June 4.</p>
        <p>Still, while the cult of celebrity is perhaps now more disguised, Mr. Saumarez Smith seems aware of the perils entailed. ''We walk a tightrope between maintaining the dignity of the institution and at the same time democratizing it and making it of general public interest,'' he explained. ''Someone said that we are 'gingerly tapping into the celebrity cult,' and I'd go along with that. The reality is that every meeting with the trustees begins with a question about attendance figures.''</p>
        <p>One way the gallery has found to be trendy without over-committing itself is to differentiate between its photographic collection and its permanent collection. Thus it can show a photo portrait of, say, a top soccer star, David Beckham, while its new acquisitions include oils of the businessman Richard Branson and the stage director Jonathan Miller, who presumably may still be working when Mr. Beckham has hung up his boots.</p>
        <p>The architecture of the new wing, though, has done most to restore some balance between old and new, to emphasize what Mr. Saumaraz Smith calls ''the totality of the building.'' And for those who take the escalator, there is the added attraction one floor higher of the new Portrait Restaurant and its panoramic view of central London. Indeed, it is a view that is a pointed reminder of the history contained in the museum. Visitors who have just seen Sir William Beechey's 1800 portrait of Nelson can now view the statue of the admiral presiding over Trafalgar Square.</p>
