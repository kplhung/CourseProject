        <p>Six months after a 22-year-old Mexican laborer, Eduardo Daniel, was killed in a collapse at a Brooklyn construction site, lawyers for his estate said yesterday that they would file suit today against his employer, Eugene Ostreicher, a builder who is under criminal investigation by state and local authorities.</p>
        <p>In addition to suing Mr. Ostreicher, the estate plans to sue his son, Chaim, and several business partners, who they said circumvented city building regulations and failed to protect their workers.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the estate, James Longhi, said he planned to use Fire Department records detailing three similar collapses at another Ostreicher construction site in Williamsburg to show that the builder could have foreseen the accident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ostreicher, through his lawyer, Frank B. Mandel, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.</p>
