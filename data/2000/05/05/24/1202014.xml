        <p>The Rutgers University president, Francis L. Lawrence, told graduates at the university's commencement today that the Internet would usher in ''a new era of fundamental and far-reaching change'' in education and that young people should be prepared to use it to its full potential.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lawrence spoke at a ceremony for graduate students and some handpicked undergraduates that was the first of 26 events across 8 campuses over two days. When the ceremonies are over, 10,790 graduates will have received degrees from Rutgers, including 7,110 baccalaureate and 2,969 master's degrees.</p>

        <p>The Rutgers University president, Francis L. Lawrence, told graduates at the university's commencement today that the Internet would usher in ''a new era of fundamental and far-reaching change'' in education and that young people should be prepared to use it to its full potential.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lawrence spoke at a ceremony for graduate students and some handpicked undergraduates that was the first of 26 events across 8 campuses over two days. When the ceremonies are over, 10,790 graduates will have received degrees from Rutgers, including 7,110 baccalaureate and 2,969 master's degrees.</p>
        <p>The Internet, Dr. Lawrence said,  ''will enable educators not only to tailor the learning environment to individual learners, but to give all learners a richer learning environment that allows them to participate, grow, make discoveries and extend their abilities far beyond the passive absorption that the typical A student was able to reach in the old concept of literacy.''</p>
        <p>At the morning ceremony in Piscataway, honorary degrees were given to Lindy Boggs, the United States ambassador to the Vatican and former representative from Louisiana; Ralph L. Brinster, the Richard King Mellon Professor of Reproductive Physiology; Richard A. Levao, chairman of the Rutgers board of governors; Murray Louis, choreographer; and Robert Pinsky, the poet laureate of the United States.</p>
        <p>At Camden on Wednesday, honorary degrees will be given to Jose Ramos-Horta, the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize co-recipient, and to the Rev. Leon Sullivan, who put together the Sullivan principles for corporate responsibility in South Africa.</p>
        <p>This year's graduates include Bojana Blagojevic, a refugee from Bosnia, and Shant Sarkuni, a 15-year-old who with his brother and cousin formed a company that writes software for Wall Street companies. Ms. Blagojevic was 15 when her town, Gorazde, came under siege and her school was destroyed. She volunteered for the Red Cross in Bosnia, taught herself English and came to the United States at 17.</p>
        <p>Rutgers officials say Mr. Sarkuni is the second-youngest graduate ever of Rutgers College, edged out only by his cousin, Hannes, who graduated when he was 14 in 1996.</p>
        <p>New School University</p>
        <p>The graduating class of New School University filled the pews in Riverside Church in Upper Manhattan yesterday morning accompanied by the triumphal march from ''Aida'' performed by a brass quintet from the university's own music division, the Mannes School of Music.</p>
        <p>''It is a rare and wonderful moment when success teaches us humility, and this, I believe, is precisely the moment at which we find ourselves at the end of the 20th century,'' said Evelyn Fox Keller, the theoretical physicist and science author, whose speech detailed the imminent completion by biologists of the human genome project.</p>
        <p>''Before this year is out, we can expect to witness the culmination of one of the most ambitious projects in the history of biology,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The university conferred 827 graduate and 399 undergraduate degrees to students from 6 of its 7 academic divisions. Honorary degrees were awarded to Ms. Keller; Thomas L. Friedman, foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times; Malcolm Klein, a longtime trustee of the New School University; Dr. Antonia Pantoja, organizer of Aspira, the Puerto Rican advocacy group; and Orlando Patterson, sociologist.</p>
