        <p>The world's largest airline, United, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the biggest carrier in the Northeast, US Airways, for $4.3 billion in cash, which would create a carrier with by far the largest share of passengers from Boston to New York to Washington.</p>

        <p>The world's largest airline, United, said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire the biggest carrier in the Northeast, US Airways, for $4.3 billion in cash, which would create a carrier with by far the largest share of passengers from Boston to New York to Washington.</p>
        <p>If the acquisition is approved by shareholders and government regulators, United will carry almost 500,000 passengers a day, have hubs in nine American cities from Philadelphia to San Francisco and employ 145,000 people. The acquisition represents the first merger of two large American airlines since a wave of consolidation in the 1980's, and analysts said United's new strength would force other airlines to consider deals as well.</p>
        <p>The UAL Corporation, the parent of United, said the combination would allow millions of travelers in the Northeast -- long the company's weak spot in the United States -- to tap into its vast network of flights to the Midwest and West Coast and, on partner airlines, to Europe and Asia. The company also pledged not to raise fares on some domestic routes for at least two years except for price increases needed to cover inflation and higher fuel costs.</p>
        <p>In addition, UAL said it intended to shed many of US Airways' routes at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington and sell them to Robert L. Johnson, a member of the US Airways board and the founder of Black Entertainment Television. Mr. Johnson plans to operate a new airline with those planes, employees and routes. But it will not include US Airways' lucrative shuttle service between Washington, New York and Boston, which United would continue to operate.</p>
        <p>The step is intended to satisfy regulators who might become concerned about market concentration in the Washington area, where United is the largest carrier at Washington Dulles International Airport and US Airways is in a similar position at Reagan Airport.</p>
        <p>Even after selling some routes to Mr. Johnson, United would dominate many markets in the East, from Charlotte, N.C. -- where US Airways has a hub -- to Boston. At Dulles, one of the nation's fastest-growing airports, United would fly about 62 percent of all passengers, according to 1999 airline traffic data published by Aviation Daily, an industry newsletter. At La Guardia Airport, United would jump over Delta to become the largest carrier with a 32 percent market share. In Baltimore, it would surpass Southwest and fly more than a third of travelers.</p>
        <p>United agreed to pay $60 a share for US Airways, a rich premium over the $25.9375 that the stock closed at yesterday. United is also taking on $7.3 billion in US Airways debt. United will not lay off any of its new employees, the company said, and will instead profit from the deal by winning more of the coast-to-coast and overseas business of the passengers who now fly US Airways. United has long hoped to gain a better foothold in the East, the busiest region in the United States.</p>
        <p>The combined company will be run by UAL's chief executive, James E. Goodwin, a career United employee who unexpectedly won the top job last year in large part because of the unions' support for him. Mr. Goodwin, 55, joined United as an accountant in 1967 and has since overseen many of its divisions.</p>
        <p>The merger would complete a flirtation that continued on and off in the mid-1990's. The chairman of US Airways, Stephen M. Wolf, and its chief executive, Rakesh Gangwal, are both former United executives.</p>
        <p>United backed away from a deal in 1995 after its powerful pilots' union expressed concerns about combining seniority lists.</p>
        <p>Executives involved in the negotiations said objections from UAL's pilots might prove difficult again.</p>
        <p>The pilots' union, which is represented on UAL's board, is likely to announce today that it opposes the transaction.</p>
        <p>''The pilots will not be fully on board,'' one executive said. ''Integration of seniority lists is a particularly difficult issue for the unions, and the issue exists now, as it did in 1995.''</p>
        <p>UAL employees, which own 55 percent of the company, have three representatives on its board, two of whom are representatives from the pilots' and machinists' unions. According to the corporate bylaws, approval of this sort of transaction is required from at least one of the two union representatives.</p>
        <p>US Airways, the sixth-largest airline in the United States, has struggled in recent years even as the industry has enjoyed its most profitable years ever. With maintenance, labor and computer-related difficulties, the carrier has reported three consecutive quarterly losses. Airline analysts expect it to return to profitability this year.</p>
        <p>Since January 1999, its stock has fallen to its current level from $62.25, leaving the company vulnerable to a takeover.</p>
        <p>As a hodgepodge of the original airline and a group of companies it acquired in the 1980's, including Allegheny Airlines and Piedmont Airlines, US Airways suffers from high costs that come with different fleets and complicated work rules, said Glenn D. Engel, an airline analyst at Goldman, Sachs.</p>
        <p>US Airways also flies relatively short routes in the crowded Eastern corridor, where flights are often late and planes spend more time waiting on runways than they do elsewhere in the country. And in recent years it began to face more competition from Southwest Airlines, the profitable low-cost carrier that has started flying out of Baltimore, Providence, R.I., and other Northeast cities, driving down many fares.</p>
        <p>United now faces the difficult task of merging US Airways' fleet and its 45,000-person work force with its own while it is in the midst of increasingly contentious labor talks with its pilots' and machinists' unions. In 1995, United became the nation's largest company in which the employees owned a majority stake after the pilots and machinists agreed to concessions in exchange for stock. That agreement expires this year, and US Airways employees are not expected to receive shares as part of the merger</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts said they expected both investors and regulators to approve it. Other deals could then follow, the analysts said.</p>
        <p>''The moral to the story is that the dance commences,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''This is the beginning of consolidation in the United States and around the world. It won't stop here.''</p>
        <p>The airline industry has enjoyed some of its healthiest profits the last three years after executives, smarting from a glut of capacity that helped cause billions of dollars worth of losses in the last recession, cut back on their purchase of new planes. Over the last year, however, capacity growth has increased again, and many unions have negotiated raises for the first time since the industry's troubles in the mid-1990's. Profits and stock prices have declined as a result.</p>
        <p>The biggest American airlines have already paired up in alliances over the last three years, agreeing to combine their frequent-flier programs and, in the case of Continental and Northwest, sell seats on each others' flights. Northwest owns a stake in Continental.</p>
        <p>The rationale behind the agreements is similar to United's interest in US Airways: the carriers want to be able to feed passengers from anywhere on to their more lucrative, long-haul flights.</p>
        <p>The merger would effectively end the frequent-flier partnership between US Airways and American Airlines. It also calls into question United's and Delta's frequent-flier alliance, which United signed largely to gain access to Delta's many passengers on the East Coast. If the US Airways acquisition becomes final, United and Delta will become much more direct rivals.</p>
        <p>A representative of the merging companies offered news of the merger yesterday to The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, on the condition that reporters not post it on the Internet until after midnight or speak to outsiders about the pending deal.</p>
        <p>Early yesterday evening, The Financial Times of London reported the merger on its Web site, citing people in Chicago, where United is based. That story quickly led to television and news service reports.</p>
