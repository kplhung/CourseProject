        <p>PIORE-Emanuel R. The Board of Trustees and the Ethical Culture Fieldston School community sadly note the death of Emanuel R. Piore, Class of 1926, a former Trustee. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Nora Kahn Piore, his son Michael J. Piore, his daughters Jane Piore Gilman, Class of 1962, and Margot Piore Onek, Class of 1960, his granddaughter Ana Piore, Class of 1992 and his entire family. A renowned physicist and educator, a gifted researcher and visionary leader, many of Dr. Piore's endeavors helped to shape modern communications and computing. Dr. Piore's life exemplifies the vision of the founder of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, Felix Adler, who said, ''Education, as we conceive of it, is designed to train students for the growing life of the world, the destiny of the human race and for their part in achieving it.'' James A. Gara and S. Donald Sussman, Co-Chairs, Board of Trustees Joseph P. Healey, Ph.D. Head of School</p>
