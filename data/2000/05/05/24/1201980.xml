        <p>Supporters and opponents of controversial bill to grant China permanent normal trade relations make little mention of current law that requires annual review of trading rights based on whether China allows free emigration; 1974 law was aimed at securing release of people who wanted to escape Communist bloc for religious reasons; Congress has granted China full trading rights ever year since diplomatic ties were established in 1979 (M)</p>

        <p>The House vote on upgrading economic relations with China on Wednesday involves nearly every aspect of international relations: trade, human rights, national security and sweatshop labor.

        <p>The issue is whether Congress will continue to treat China as a state-dominated economy whose trading rights must be reviewed each year based on whether it allows free emigration.

        <p>The House vote on upgrading economic relations with China on Wednesday involves nearly every aspect of international relations: trade, human rights, national security and sweatshop labor. But the House will decide on an issue so arcane that it is almost never mentioned by supporters or opponents.</p>
        <p>The issue is whether Congress will continue to treat China as a state-dominated economy whose trading rights must be reviewed each year based on whether it allows free emigration. Congress established the review in the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, originally aimed at securing the release of people who wanted to escape Communist bloc nations for religious reasons.</p>
        <p>Eligible nations were granted so-called most favored nation status, which allowed them to do business in the United States under favorable tariff rates and investment rules. Last year, Congress and the Clinton administration changed the designation to ''normal trade relations,'' a less weighty phrase thought to be less politically charged.</p>
        <p>After China and the United States established diplomatic relations in 1979, Congress has granted China full trading rights every year, though the debate is often contentious.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Clinton administration negotiated an agreement with China on its entry to the World Trade Organization and promised that it would ask Congress to grant normal trade relations and end the annual reviews.</p>
        <p>Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, which is based in Geneva, members must treat one another as most favored nations for trading purposes to get full access to one another's markets. It is rare for two members to deny each other that status. One example: Cuba and the United States are both members, and the United States denies Cuba full trading rights.</p>
        <p>Under the organization's rules, China would have the right to withhold trading benefits to nations that do not treat it as a most favored trading partner. In the absence of permanent normal relations, then, China could deny a slew of trade benefits to United States companies and farmers.</p>
        <p>Actually, it is a bit more complicated than that. The Clinton administration has acknowledged that under a 1979 agreement with China, Beijing must offer the same import tariff rates to the United States that it offers all other nations.</p>
        <p>But that pact did not cover important areas of trade like telecommunications and financial services, which are included in the agreement negotiated last year. So some of the important concessions China made to the United States to join the organization could be denied American companies if Congress rejects the elevated trade status.</p>
        <p>Regardless of how House votes, China will probably join the trade body late this year. It has now completed entry agreements with almost all other members, most recently the European Union.</p>
        <p>If the House were to vote no it could always take up the issue at another time -- even under the next president. The Clinton administration has argued, however, that a no vote would rock United States-China relations at a sensitive time.</p>
        <p>If the House votes yes, the measure is expected to be taken up in early June in the Senate, where support is thought to be much stronger than in the House.</p>
