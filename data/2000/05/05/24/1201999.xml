        <p>Some big airports in Northeast face changes if United Airlines acquires US Airways; some experts say any merger that makes weaker carrier like US Airways stronger could improve competition; few big airports in Northeast will be subject to significant changes, raising issue of whether certain hubs will be so thoroughly dominated by one airline that they could dictate prices by scaring off potential competitors; possible changes at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Washington Dulles airport, Reagan National, La Guardia, Logan International, Newark International and Kennedy International discussed; chart; photos (M)</p>

        <p>The world's largest airline, United, plans to announce today that it will acquire the biggest carrier in the Northeast, US Airways, for $4.3 billion in cash, creating a carrier with by far the largest share of passengers from Boston to New York to Washington.</p>

        <p>The world's largest airline, United, plans to announce today that it will acquire the biggest carrier in the Northeast, US Airways, for $4.3 billion in cash, creating a carrier with by far the largest share of passengers from Boston to New York to Washington.</p>
        <p>If the acquisition is approved by shareholders and government regulators, United will carry almost 500,000 passengers a day, have hubs in seven American cities from Baltimore to San Francisco, and employ 145,000 people. The acquisition represents the first merger of two large American airlines since a wave of consolidation in the 1980's, and analysts said United's new strength would force other airlines to consider deals as well.</p>
        <p>The UAL Corporation, the parent of United, said the combination would allow millions of travelers in the Northeast -- long the company's weak spot in the United States -- to tap into its vast network of flights to the Midwest and West Coast and, on partner airlines, to Europe and Asia. The company also pledged not to raise fares on some domestic routes for at least two years except for price increases needed to cover inflation and higher fuel costs.</p>
        <p>In addition, UAL said it would shed many of US Airways' routes at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington and sell them to Robert  L. Johnson, a member of the US Airways board and the founder of Black Entertainment Television. Mr. Johnson plans to operate a new airline with those planes, employees and routes.</p>
        <p>The step, which will not include the lucrative shuttle service between Washington, New York and Boston, is intended to satisfy regulators who might become concerned about market concentration in the Washington area, where United is the largest carrier at Washington Dulles International Airport and US Airways is in a similar position at Reagan Airport.</p>
        <p>Even after selling some routes to Mr. Johnson, United would dominate many markets in the East, from Charlotte, N.C. -- where US Airways has a hub -- to Boston. At Dulles, one of the nation's fastest-growing airports, United would fly about 62 percent of all passengers, according to 1999 airline traffic data published by Aviation Daily, an industry newsletter. At La Guardia Airport, United would jump over Delta to become the largest carrier with a 32 percent market share. In Baltimore, it would surpass Southwest and fly more than a third of travelers.</p>
        <p>United agreed to pay $60 a share for US Airways, a rich premium over the $25.9375 that the stock closed at yesterday. United will not lay off any of its new employees, the company said, and will instead profit from the deal by winning more of the coast-to-coast and overseas business of the passengers who now fly US Airways.</p>
        <p>The merger would complete a flirtation that continued on and off in the mid-1990's, much of it overseen by Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman of US Airways, who was United's chief executive in the early 1990's. United executives have long hoped to gain a better foothold in the East, the busiest region in the United States. United backed away from a deal in 1995 after its powerful pilots' union expressed concerns about combining seniority lists.</p>
        <p>Executives involved in the negotiations said objections from UAL's pilots might prove difficult again.</p>
        <p>The pilots union, which is represented on UAL's board, is likely to announce today that it opposes the transaction.</p>
        <p>''The pilots will not be fully on board,'' one executive said. ''Integration of seniority lists is a particularly difficult issue for the unions, and the issue exists now, as it did in 1995.''</p>
        <p>UAL employees, which own 55 percent of the company, have three representatives on its board, two of which are representatives from the pilots' and machinists' unions. According to the corporate bylaws, approval of this sort of transaction is required from at least one of the two union representatives.</p>
        <p>US Airways, the sixth-largest airline in the United States, has struggled in recent years even as the industry has enjoyed its most profitable years ever. With maintenance, labor and computer-related difficulties, the carrier has reported three straight quarterly losses. Airline analysts expect it to return to profitability this year.</p>
        <p>Since January 1999, its stock has fallen to its current level from $62.25, leaving the company vulnerable to a takeover.</p>
        <p>As a hodgepodge of the original airline and a group of companies it acquired in the 1980's, including Allegheny Air Lines and Piedmont Airlines, US Airways suffers from high costs that come with different fleets and complicated work rules.</p>
        <p>US Airways also flies relatively short routes in the crowded Eastern corridor, where flights are often late and planes spend more time waiting on runways than they do elsewhere in the country. And in recent years it began to face more competition from Southwest Airlines, the profitable low-cost carrier that has started flying out of Baltimore, Providence, R.I., and other northeastern cities, driving down many fares.</p>
        <p>United's executives now face the difficult task of merging US Airways' fleet and its 45,000-person work force with its own at the same time that is in the midst of increasingly contentious labor talks with its pilots' and machinists' unions. In 1995, United became the nation's largest company in which the employees owned a majority stake after the pilots and machinists agreed to concessions in exchange for stock. That agreement expires this year, and US Airways employees are not expected to receive shares as part of the merger</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts said they expected both investors and regulators to approve it. Other deals could then follow, the analysts said.</p>
        <p>''The moral to the story is that the dance commences,'' Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said. ''This is the beginning of consolidation in the United States and around the world. It won't stop here.''</p>
        <p>The biggest American airlines have already paired up in alliances over the last three years, agreeing to combine their frequent-flier programs and, in the case of Continental and Northwest, sell seats on each others' flights. Northwest owns a stake in Continental as part of their  agreement, but the two continue to operate separately.</p>
        <p>The rationale behind the agreements is similar to United's interest in US Airways: the carriers want to be able to feed passengers from anywhere on to their more lucrative, long-haul flights.</p>
        <p>The merger would effectively end the frequent-flier partnership between US Airways and American Airlines because United and American, the world's two largest airlines by revenue, would have little incentive to be partners. It also calls into question United's and Delta's frequent-flier alliance, which United signed largely to gain access to Delta's many passengers on the East Coast. If the US Airways acquisition becomes final, United and Delta will become much more direct rivals.</p>
        <p>The deal will also complicate United's long effort to improve its credit to ''investment grade'' and then be able to decrease the cost it pays to borrow money. One of the two largest credit rating agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's, still ranks United just below investment grade. Now, by acquiring US Airways, United is taking on $7.3 billion of the carrier's debt and buying an airline with a credit rating that has dropped significantly since 1990.</p>
        <p>''Among the large airlines, they're the weakest other than T.W.A.,'' said Philip Baggaley, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>American and Delta, the two biggest airlines after United, both have a stronger credit rating already, Mr. Baggaley said.</p>
        <p>A representative of the companies offered news of the merger yesterday to The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, on the condition that reporters not post it on the Internet until after midnight or speak to outsiders about the pending deal.</p>
        <p>Early yesterday evening, The Financial Times of London reported the merger on its Web site, citing sources in Chicago, where United has its headquarters. That story quickly led to television and news service reports.</p>
