        <p>The Nasdaq composite index plunged to its lowest level in six months yesterday as the broad stock market declined for a fifth consecutive day.</p>
        <p>Concerns about the economy's strength have left investors jittery, and Wall Street strategists say stocks may have a difficult time taking off again until investors are convinced that the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates to ward off inflation.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite dropped 199.66, or 5.9 percent, to 3,164.55, its 10th-biggest decline ever in percentage terms. It fell below its previous low for the year, 3,321 reached on April 14, a Friday that had capped a terrible week and a record 25.3 percent decline. At its new low, the technology-heavy index is down 22.2 percent for the year and 37.3 percent from its peak in March.</p>
        <p>On Monday, stocks rallied late and regained most of what had been steep losses earlier in the day, but yesterday the major indexes took the opposite tack, swooning as the close approached and finishing at their lows for the day.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 120.28, or 1.1 percent, to 10,422.27, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 26.86, or 1.9 percent, to 1,373.86. Those two indexes remained above their April 14 closing levels. The Dow is down 9.4 percent for the year, while the S.&amp; P. 500 is off 6.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equities strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, sees more declines ahead. After visiting money managers across the country for the last six weeks, he has concluded that most of their portfolios are still too vulnerable to higher interest rates. ''People own too many tech stocks still, and they probably own too many financial stocks,'' he said. ''We will be wrestling with how high interest rates are going till Labor Day.''</p>
        <p>In the bond market, prices rose slightly, as yields, which move in the opposite direction, fell. Even with a threat of higher interest rates, bonds often rally when stocks fall sharply as investors move out of stocks. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note slipped to 6.42 percent, from 6.44 percent on Monday, while the price rose 3/32 to 100 17/32. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.16 percent from 6.19 percent.</p>
        <p>Cisco, Hewlett-Packard, I.B.M. and Intel led the technology group down yesterday, but industrial stocks also declined. General Motors has lost 13.8 percent of its value in two days after announcing it was limiting how many shares of its stock it would swap for shares in its Hughes Electronics subsidiary. Other decliners were International Paper and United Technologies. Drug stocks, including Merck and Schering-Plough, rose after the two companies announced a joint venture. Some financial stocks also gained, including American Express.</p>
        <p>Several factors are hurting the stock market now, analysts say. One is the belated realization by many investors that the Federal Reserve is determined to continue raising its target for short-term interest rates until the economy slows.</p>
        <p>Before the Fed raised its target rate a half a percentage point to 6.5 percent a week ago, many investors had apparently expected the Fed to act cautiously. The cautious approach -- five quarter-point rate increases since June -- had failed to slow economic growth significantly and left investors feeling relatively positive. But last week's bigger rate increase and the accompanying statement that pointed to more increases ahead ''dashed whatever remaining hopes there were that the Fed was close to on hold,'' Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States equities strategist at Lehman Brothers, told his clients this week. ''Until there is an end in sight for Fed tightening, we expect that the stock market will continue to churn with little direction and volume.''</p>
        <p>Lehman Brothers' economists predict another half-point increase by the Fed in June and a final quarter-point increase in August. Stocks will only rally, Mr. Applegate said, when investors are convinced that the economy has slowed enough for the Fed to stop raising rates.</p>
        <p>The Fed is now expected to slow economic growth from the current 5 percent pace to 3 percent or 3.5 percent, and as it does, earnings forecasts will fall a bit. Some analysts are already lowering their predictions of earnings growth for the companies in the S.&amp; P. 500.</p>
        <p>In addition, investors are grappling with the prospect that the technology sector is not immune to rising rates.</p>
        <p>If higher rates dampen stock prices, those companies will find it harder to raise cash in the equity market and to use their stock to buy other companies. And their earnings could also be lowered as old-economy companies trim spending plans in light of a slowing economy.</p>
        <p>One question for investors and Federal Reserve officials is whether the lackluster performance of the stock market over the last 12 months is beginning to have an impact on consumer spending. Since a year ago, the Dow has lost 3.8 percent, the S.&amp; P. 500 has gained 3.3 percent and the Nasdaq index, which soared 85.6 percent in 1999, has retained a 25.6 percent gain.</p>
        <p>Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, and other Fed members have said that five consecutive years of double-digit returns in the stock market have been the main force behind the consumer spending boom that has propelled the economy to its longest expansion ever. And while Fed officials have gone to great lengths to claim that they are not aiming to drive the stock market lower, they have acknowledged that this wealth effect is making it difficult to rein in economic growth.</p>
