        <p>Representatives Barney Frank, a liberal Democrat from the Boston suburbs, and Dana Rohrabacher, a conservative Republican from southern California, don't agree on much.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank's lifetime voting record on issues dear to the A.F.L-C.I.O., for example, is 93 percent. Mr. Rohrabacher, by contrast, proudly claims a 13 percent mark.</p>
        <p>But for very different reasons, these two congressmen at polar opposites of the political spectrum are part of a left-right coalition on Capitol Hill that is fighting the Clinton administration's decisive China trade bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank, considered perhaps the single best debater in Congress,  fears that granting China permanent normal trade status would widen the gap between the world's economic haves and have-nots.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rohrabacher, a former speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, opposes rewarding a trade plum to ''the brutal dictators in Beijing,'' a government he says is using a trade surplus with the United States to modernize its military and endanger American security.</p>
        <p>With the crucial vote in the House set for Wednesday and supporters claiming a slight edge, lawmakers who in many cases would not be caught dead associating with each other are banding together, however reluctantly, to round up the last remaining undecided votes and defeat a common foe.</p>
        <p>''If you're not able to work closely with people you despise, you can't really work here,'' Mr. Frank explained.</p>
        <p>Supporters have their own set of odd pro-trade partners, starting with the alignment between President Clinton and perhaps his most vehement critic in Congress, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, who as the Republican whip is responsible for rounding up Republican votes for the bill. Two of the measure's biggest backers, David Dreier, a California Republican, and Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat, have consulted regularly for weeks.</p>
        <p>The China bill's opponents, dominated nearly three to one by Democrats, are hoping to tap into a series of smaller left-right alliances forged over the years in past legislative fights, and fuse them together to form one powerful deal-killer.</p>
        <p>But a big question for these opponents remains: What angers them more, the trade bill or each other?</p>
        <p>Until just a couple of weeks ago, Democratic and Republican foes largely held separate news conferences, conducted separate strategy sessions and kept ever so secret their respective vote-count lists.</p>
        <p>''There's not as much cooperation as you'd think,'' said one senior House Republican aide and veteran of past trade wars with Democratic allies. ''In the past, there were joint meetings. This time, I've wondered sometimes, 'Gee, why are there only Republicans in this meeting?'  There's been more partisanship on the part of the Democrats. They really want to take over the House.''</p>
        <p>Some Democratic opponents say Republicans have been wary of working with Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the chief Democratic vote-counter against the measure, because Mr. Bonior was the chief Democratic tormentor of former Speaker Newt Gingrich.  ''They hate us,'' said one top aide to Mr. Bonior.</p>
        <p>To some extent, it makes good practical and political sense for each side to work with its own members, and then designate emissaries to coordinate with the other side. Republican critics have tended to focus on the national security threat and China's record on human rights and religious freedoms. Democratic foes have dwelled on Chinese worker rights and environmental standards, and the potential loss of union jobs in this country. Both sides worry about sacrificing Congress's annual renewal of China's trade status.</p>
        <p>''We're largely working in our own camps because we always do,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat and long-time critic of China's human rights record. ''We speak to each other's experts. It's like a bridge game, playing to each other's strengths.''</p>
        <p>Many opponents fought together in two previous legislative trade wars: the 1993 North American Free Trade Act (Mr. Clinton won that round), and the debates in 1997 and 1998 over granting the President fast-track negotiating authority (Mr. Clinton lost those).</p>
        <p>Some Republicans who oppose the measure on national security grounds, fearing China's sabre-rattling and hegemony toward Taiwan, have teamed up with a handful of Democratic defense hawks on the armed services committees. That is why Representative Duncan Hunter, a conservative California Republican, sees eye-to-eye on the China bill with Representative Neil Abercrombie, a Hawaii Democrat.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pelosi has worked closely with Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey and Frank R. Wolf of Virginia, both Republican, to pressure China to improve its human rights record. ''It's the issues that matter, not the partisanship and human right is not a conservative or liberal issue,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank agreed. ''I've worked very closely with Frank Wolf on East Timor, as well as with Chris Smith, who probably thinks I'll burn in hell for all eternity, which is a deterrent for a good friendship,'' Mr. Frank said, joking about being openly gay.</p>
        <p>''I pay no attention to the label,'' Mr. Smith said when told of Mr. Frank's remarks, taking his ribbing in stride and noting that he had worked with the Massachusetts Democrat to crack down on abusive child-labor practices overseas.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Bonior seems to have broken down some partisan barriers lately, joining Mr. Wolf and two other Republicans, Bob Ney of Ohio and Tom Tancredo of Colorado, at three news conferences in the last two weeks. ''We have a true coalition,'' said Mr. Bonior, who led a bipartisan rally today with environmental, farming, veterans and rights groups.</p>
        <p>The problem with such alliances on Capitol Hill is that they can be fleeting. Political marriages of conveniences can often end in annulment.</p>
        <p>Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, and Representative Tom Campbell, a California Republican, had discussed holding a China briefing for opponents until Mr. Campbell abruptly announced on Monday that he was reversing himself and voting for the measure.</p>
        <p>''The truth is, most coalitions in Congress come together for temporary purposes,'' said Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat who opposes the measure.</p>
        <p>On the China bill, opponents have regularly traded notes and strategy on the House floor, the great bazaar of all legislative deals, Mr. Kucinich said. ''That's where we get business done,'' said Mr. Kucinich, a former mayor of Cleveland.</p>
        <p>With business groups waging an all-out ad campaign to gather drive home the winning votes, opponents expressed confidence their alignment would still prevail.</p>
        <p>''There are principled people on both ends of the spectrum who tend to respect each other more than those who stick a wet finger in the air to see how to vote,'' Mr. Rohrabacher said.</p>
