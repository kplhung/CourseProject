        <p>Sometimes, one network's ''unacceptable'' television is another network's really good stuff.</p>
        <p>Case in point: UPN has picked up two specials discarded by the Fox network and plans to show them some time during the next television season: ''World's Nastiest Neighbors'' and ''Cheating Spouses.'' As the titles indicate, the specials feature segments on neighbors doing horrible things and spouses, well, also doing horrible things.</p>
        <p>It is the kind of fare that once served Fox well. That is, until the network ran ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' and put forward a bridegroom with a blot on his past. The groom, Rick Rockwell, was once the subject of a restraining order, it was learned after the program was shown.</p>
        <p>In the furor that followed, Fox executives disavowed their reality specials.</p>
        <p>UPN executives said they were only too happy to pick up the ''Cheating Spouses'' and ''Nastiest Neighbors'' specials, which were originally produced for Fox. Specials like these may be offensive to some, they said, but tend to do well in the ratings, which is why Fox ran them for so long.</p>
        <p>''We're happy to embrace the audience Fox is disavowing,'' said Paul McGuire, a UPN spokesman.</p>
