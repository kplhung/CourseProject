        <p>Tony Martin was a 55-year-old farmer with an obsessive fear of intruders who lived alone in a debris-strewn farmhouse called Bleak House. Fred Barras was a teenager with a long criminal record who lived with his family in a housing development 70 miles away.</p>
        <p>Last August, it took only a moment for Mr. Barras, 16, to break into Bleak House, and only a moment for Mr. Martin to shoot him. Staggering and calling for his mother, Mr. Barras bled to death. And, in April, it took a jury just nine and a half hours to convict Mr. Martin of murder.</p>
        <p>But the case is not over, nor has it been confined to this Norfolk farming community. It has set off an angry national debate about the police and crime in rural England, Britain's strict gun control laws, and -- most explosively in this staunchly law-and-order society -- how far citizens should be allowed to go in the name of self-defense.</p>
        <p>In the process, Mr. Martin, a fiercely independent man who plowed his wheat fields by moonlight, slept in his clothes, kept an unregistered shotgun under his bed and clutched a teddy bear in court during his trial, has become an unlikely hero to many Britons who feel that the criminal justice system has gone way too far in penalizing victims rather than criminals.</p>
        <p>In survey after survey Britons have overwhelmingly condemned Mr. Martin's conviction, generally by margins of more than 90 percent. At the conservative-leaning Sun, more than 200,000 people have called a special pro-Martin telephone number to register their support.</p>
        <p>And William Hague, the Conservative Party leader, has drawn some of the most flattering headlines of his career -- depending, that is, on the newspaper -- by loudly calling for tougher laws to protect homeowners who use violence to defend their homes.</p>
        <p>''Conservatives believe the first and foremost responsibility of the state is to protect law-abiding citizens,'' Mr. Hague said. ''The government is failing in that responsibility, which is why the outcry over the Martin case has reverberated far beyond a small village in Norfolk.''</p>
        <p>Such remarks have put the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair on the defensive, prompting it to announce plans to spend more money on rural police forces. But at the same time, the government has repeatedly defended the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service to charge Mr. Martin with murder. British law allows for the victims to use ''reasonable force'' in defending themselves or their property -- a standard the jury in the Martin case did not believe was met.</p>
        <p>''The answer to rural crime is to give the police the governmental support they need and deserve -- not undermine them by encouraging vigilantes,'' said Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democratic leader.</p>
        <p>In general, crime rates in Britain are much lower than they are in the United States, a phenomenon largely attributed to the strict laws that ban handguns, bar the use of guns for purposes other than sport and vermin control and strictly regulate who can have a gun and under what circumstances. In 1998, there were 750 homicides in England and Wales, or 1.43 per 100,000 people; the same year, there were 16,014 homicides in the United States, or 6.26 per 100,000.</p>
        <p>Still, the Martin case has prompted some calls for looser gun-control laws. Hardly lenient by American standards, the laws were made even more stringent in the aftermath of the case in Dunblane, Scotland, in 1996, in which a man opened fire on a class of primary school students, killing 18 and wounding 12, all but one of them children under 7.</p>
        <p>While crime in Britain as a whole has fallen in the last decade -- by 14 percent between 1995 and 1997, according to the government's most recent figures -- it appears to be on the increase in rural areas because the communities are not as closely knit, more houses are empty during the day and there are fewer small farms whose owners might have once watched out for one another. In 1998, farmers reported that $:93 million worth of goods, including tractors and farm equipment, was stolen; in 1994 the figure was $:72 million.</p>
        <p>Much rural crime goes unreported because victims have little faith in the police, said Richard Portham, a neighbor of Mr. Martin and one of his most active supporters. ''I know nobody who has not been a victim of crime,'' said Mr. Portham, whose flower wholesale business has been struck at least three times, by vandals, arsonists and burglars. ''Whether it's burglary, mugging, theft -- it's absolutely rampant.''</p>
        <p>By all reports, Mr. Martin had repeatedly been one such victim. Time and time again, he said at his trial, people broke into his farmhouse, set off by itself, and made off with his things: china, a dresser, a grandfather clock. Often, he did not report the intrusions, he said, because the police took so little notice.</p>
        <p>He became increasingly frightened and, after a lifetime of living alone, increasingly eccentric. Never neat, he let his house descend into squalor and earned the nickname, according to some reports, of ''Mad Man Martin.'' He got three Rottweilers to serve as guard dogs. When his gun license was revoked because he fired at the wheels of an intruder's car, he bought a shotgun, but did not register it.</p>
        <p>When Fred Barras -- along with two older men, Brendan Fearon, 30, and Darren Bark, 33 -- arrived at Bleak House on the night of Aug. 20, Mr. Martin appeared to be ready for them. He opened fire, hitting Mr. Barras in the back and Mr. Fearon multiple times in the legs. Mr. Barras staggered outside and died in the underbrush; Mr. Fearon staggered to a nearby farmhouse and pleaded for help. None of the intruders was armed.</p>
        <p>''This was a man who was prepared to be his own police force, investigating force, jury, judge and, if necessary, executioner,'' Rosamund Horwood-Smart, the prosecutor in the case, said of Mr. Martin. The jury agreed.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Portham said the jury could not have understood how frightened his friend had been. ''Every time we've discussed it, he has said that he was absolutely terrified,'' Mr. Portham said. ''They taunted him; they shone a torch in his eyes; and they could have run away, but didn't.''</p>
        <p>His apparent personal disarray -- and a tendency to denounce Gypsies and the itinerant people that Britons call travelers, who are blamed for much of the crime in Norfolk -- would seem to make Mr. Martin a problematic national hero. But in its current mood, the British public has had a far harder time mustering much sympathy for Fred Barras, who at 16 had already had a record of 29 convictions for theft, burglary, forgery and assault, and who had told friends that the Bleak House break-in was to be his first ''big job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barras came from the Hawtonville Estate about 20 miles away from Nottingham, a sprawling development of more than 1,000 small homes and apartments, some government-subsidized, others privately owned. His family lives along what is considered one of the area's poorer roads. Mr. Barras moved there with his mother and five older sisters when he was still a baby, but by Hawtonville standards was still considered a traveler.</p>
        <p>Opinion in the development is divided. Some say they were frightened of Mr. Barras and his friends, and that they would have reacted as Mr. Martin did, if it had come to it. Others feel that Mr. Barras was basically a nice boy whose main failing was his malleability. ''A lot of us knew him, went to school with him,'' said one young mother, out with a baby in a stroller the other day. ''If you gave him 10 pounds and said, 'Do this,' he'd do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barras's uncle, Tony Joynes, said he would never forget the sickening sound of the youth's sisters wailing in the streets after they heard he was dead.</p>
        <p>''Like I've told the lads, they shouldn't have broken into that man's house,'' Mr. Joynes said, speaking in his tiny but immaculate apartment a few doors down from the Barras house on Devon Road. ''But just to shoot him like that was wrong, in my eyes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin, who is appealing the case, was sentenced to life in prison, according to standard British practice for convicted murderers. If his appeal fails, lawyers say, he will in all likelihood spend fewer than 10 years behind bars.</p>
        <p>''One question I've asked everyone connected to this case is, 'What should Mr. Martin have done?' '' said Nick Makin, Mr. Martin's lawyer. ''Whatever side people take on the issue of burglars, it's incumbent on them to answer that question. And absolutely nobody has told me what else he should have done, apart from fire that gun.''</p>
