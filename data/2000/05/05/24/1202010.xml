        <p>After spending several cautious days on the sidelines, Hillary Rodham Clinton took out today after her new opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, asserting that there were sharp differences between them and criticizing him for saying he would accept the support of the Independence Party in New York, even if its presidential candidate is Patrick J. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>''I think it's fair to talk about the differences in issues between us, and just over the last several days, we learned some things about his positions that are in very clear contrast from where I stand,'' Mrs. Clinton declared to a long line of television cameras and reporters at a campaign stop here.</p>

        <p>After spending several cautious days on the sidelines, Hillary Rodham Clinton took out today after her new opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio, asserting that there were sharp differences between them and criticizing him for saying he would accept the support of the Independence Party in New York, even if its presidential candidate is Patrick J. Buchanan.</p>
        <p>''I think it's fair to talk about the differences in issues between us, and just over the last several days, we learned some things about his positions that are in very clear contrast from where I stand,'' Mrs. Clinton declared to a long line of television cameras and reporters at a campaign stop here.</p>
        <p>Her audience of elderly New Yorkers, who had put aside an afternoon of bingo to make way for an appearance by the first lady, watched transfixed as Mrs. Clinton spent seven minutes criticizing Mr. Lazio for his opposition to handgun registration and his support for an $800 billion tax cut proposed by Republicans. Mostly, though, she criticized him for saying he would accept the Independence Party's support.</p>
        <p>''I do not believe that it's in New York's best interest to support or be aligned with Pat Buchanan, who has been a divisive force, a voice for anti-Semitism,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''I strongly reject that, and my opponent has not.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's remarks signaled a new phase in her campaign, as she lent her own voice to a line of attack that had until now been carried by her aides. Her decision to criticize Mr. Lazio came after 48 hours of discussion among her advisers about the extent to which Mrs. Clinton's campaign should seek to shape New Yorkers' views of the relatively unknown congressman from Suffolk County by attacking him, and whether Mrs. Clinton herself should take  the lead in seeking to discredit him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's campaign spokesman, Dan McLagan, dismissed Mrs. Clinton's attack tonight as ''the typical Clinton Administration modus operandi: search, distort and destroy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McLagan said, ''This demonstrates to me that Mrs. Clinton is out of touch with New Yorkers and she seems intent on distorting Rick's record.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's attacks on Mr. Lazio were based on positions he laid out when he appeared on six television interview programs on Sunday, answering detailed questions about his candidacy. The appearances were closely followed by Mrs. Clinton's aides, as they sought to assemble data about their new opponent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's aides said the unusually heavy schedule of national television appearances was intended to draw a contrast to Mrs. Clinton, whom they described as leading a relatively cloistered candidacy. The first lady has so far turned down requests to appear on national television interview programs, though she has appeared on New York-based news programs.</p>
        <p>In the process of gaining the exposure, however, Mr. Lazio found himself questioned intensively about his record and his candidacy less than 24 hours after he entered the race.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was clearly moving in today on what she saw as openings in Mr. Lazio's remarks. For example, in saying that he would take the Independence Party support even if Mr. Buchanan is at the top of the ticket, Mr. Lazio took a far less nuanced position than Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who had been the Republican candidate.</p>
        <p>''If I can get it, I will take it,'' Mr. Lazio said on ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, aware that Mrs. Clinton's aides were hoping to link him to Mr. Buchanan, did not automatically reject the party's ballot line, which could provide as many as 300,000 votes to the Republican candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLagan said that Mrs. Clinton was distorting Mr. Lazio's position because the congressman has clearly stated his support for the party's candidate for president. ''The fact is that Rick supports George Bush for president, and opposes Pat Buchanan.''</p>
        <p>The campaign clipped along at a negative pace even as both sides seemed concerned that they would be blamed for its tenor. Mrs. Clinton bristled today when a television reporter asked whether it was disingenuous to complain that Mr. Lazio was running a ''campaign of insults,'' when, the reporter said, she had been running advertisements attacking Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''Which ad was that?'' the first lady demanded tersely. While Mrs. Clinton has run no such advertisements, her aides had begun attacking Mr. Lazio's record even before he announced, and Mrs. Clinton said she had no apologies for that.</p>
        <p>''This is a campaign about issues,'' she said.''</p>
