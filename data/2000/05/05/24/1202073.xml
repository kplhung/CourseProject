        <p>METRO NEWS BRIEFS: NEW YORK  Correction:  May 25, 2000, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about New York City's efforts to suspend the license of a tour company after one of its buses killed a pedestrian misstated the surname of the victim in some copies. He was Randolph Walker, not Walter.</p>
