        <p>Draped with bandoleers, Shiite Muslim guerrillas reclaimed the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon today, and as they giddily rode abandoned Israeli tanks through village after village, they laid waste to Israel's plan for an orderly, scheduled withdrawal.</p>
        <p>Six weeks before the Israelis planned to shut down the military buffer zone they controlled along the border, the Lebanese guerrillas accelerated their enemy's departure. By day's end, Israel held only Beaufort Castle, on a bluff in Lebanon overlooking northern Israel.</p>
        <p>[Before dawn Wednesday, the Israelis abandoned that and all of their outposts in Lebanon, and were bringing home their last troops, Israeli military officials said. Shortly after sunrise, the last tank rumbled across the frontier behind a column of armored vehicles, and the border fence was locked.]</p>
        <p>With the troops leaving, Israel's occupation of a swath of Lebanon, maintained since 1978, was ending in a far quicker and more improvisational way than anyone predicted.</p>
        <p>''There is only one headline in Lebanon tonight,'' a broadly smiling anchorwoman said on the official state television channel. ''The liberation of the land. The slinking, servile withdrawal by Israel.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, has protested assertions by the Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas that Israel was being chased out. He made a campaign pledge last year, he said repeatedly, to end Israel's ''misguided'' involvement in Lebanon, which has divided and troubled Israelis from the start.</p>
        <p>Today in Jerusalem, Mr. Barak declared an end to the ''18-year tragedy'' dating from Israel's large-scale invasion of Lebanon in 1982, and his government declared that it has regained the initiative in the halting Middle East peace efforts.</p>
        <p>Israel said that from now on it would hold the governments in Beirut and Damascus, Syria, responsible for any attacks on northern Israel from Lebanese territory, and said it would not rule out retaliatory strikes. [Page A13.]</p>
        <p>But Lebanon, flashing a nationwide victory sign, would have none of that sort of talk today.</p>
        <p>All day long, traveling with Hezbollah into the land so long held by its Israeli enemies, a celebratory procession grew as it wound its way from west to east through the rugged countryside. By the road, elderly Lebanese women ululated and sprinkled the cars with rose petals and rice as if at a wedding.</p>
        <p>Flashing V's and waving the yellow flags of their Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement, the guerrillas trailed a miles-long parade of supporters, including villagers returning to the south for the first time in two decades. ''You know when birds fly out of a cage?'' said Abu Jaffa, a 26-year-old Hezbollah officer. ''That's how we feel.'' Like sports announcers, local radio reporters gave a village by village account of the ''liberation'' of the nine-mile-deep zone over the course of the day. ''Yarun is now liberated,'' one said this morning, ''and I'm looking over into occupied Palestine.''</p>
        <p>Israel accelerated the disintegration of its control over the zone by pulling out its troops and equipment in stages and turning over many posts to the Lebanese Christian militia it has armed and trained, the South Lebanon Army. But town by town, the militia soldiers caved in to local pressure. Those who did not seek to cross into Israel turned themselves over to Hezbollah leaders.</p>
        <p>The tumble of events began last Thursday when the South Lebanon Army deserted a small village. It picked up steam on Sunday, when the militia left behind a more significant post. And then it snowballed, catching everyone by surprise, including Lebanese journalists, who scrambled to set up television links in the town of Bint Jbail so that they could record the event that most had been waiting a career to capture.</p>
        <p>By tonight about 620 of the 2,000-member militia had defected, Lebanese officials said. Many face charges of treason. Although it was announced that the Lebanese Army was now detaining them, no mention was made of where or of what might become of them.</p>
        <p>Presumably, the Israelis planned to blow up their posts before completing the withdrawal, as they had done in the village of Jezzin, abandoned last year. But the situation changed before they could carry out their plans. In at least one instance today, the militia soldiers disappeared so quickly that they left tanks with their motors running and stoves with rice cooking on them.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah fighters quickly foraged through the deserted posts, stocking up on Israeli rocket launchers, ammunition and gear before Israel had a chance to stop them. In some cases, Hezbollah guerrillas squabbled with members of Amal, the other Lebanese Shiite resistance group, over the Hebrew-inscribed equipment.</p>
        <p>At the Mediterranean port of Naqura this morning, Hezbollah worked quickly, fearful that the seaside post, which featured twin wall paintings of the Israeli Star of David and the cedars of Lebanon, was booby-trapped.</p>
        <p>As a honking convoy of newly captured Israeli tanks headed to Bint Jbail, in the zone's center, Israeli helicopters began buzzing overhead. Soon they were bombarding some of their own abandoned posts. They also released heat bombs to deflect fire, and their aerial raids briefly detained the sweep through the countryside.</p>
        <p>One man, Abed Taqoush, 50, died in the bombing. He was a veteran taxi driver for the foreign press who helped reporters cover the conflict in Lebanon for 23 years.</p>
        <p>As it resumed, the convoy converted a narrow road into a traffic jam directed by gun-toting Hezbollah crossing guards. The Hezbollah fighters, who kept a low profile in Lebanon as they fought the Israelis, launching mortar attacks from citrus groves, surfaced spontaneously and talked relatively freely.</p>
        <p>''They have run in the end,'' said a youth who gave his name as Jawad, speaking of the Israelis. ''We always knew they would, but no one would have guessed it could happen so quickly.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether the battle was over, the young men said that decision was up to Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah. ''Our purpose is to be told what to do,'' one said. ''If Nasrallah says the fight is on, it's on. And if it's off, it's off.''</p>
        <p>His fellow fighter, though, said they had gotten as far as they had because ''Jerusalem twinkles in our eyes'' -- a comment that would chill many Israelis to the bone.</p>
        <p>Until today the southern zone was off limits to most Lebanese. Starting at midmorning, Lebanese Army officers opened the tightly controlled checkpoints, and packed cars began rolling past the gates that have divided the country.</p>
        <p>Many cars contained Hezbollah's fighters and its true believers, like Hala Smayel and a gaggle of young women -- friends of hers -- who alternated jumping up and down with yelling, ''Nasrallah forever!'' They dragged out his name into four syllables, so that it sounded like ''Nasser-Allah,'' a play on the name's literal meaning, since nasser means victory and Allah is God.</p>
        <p>''We are going village to village to give congratulations,'' Miss Smayel said. ''Hezbollah was able to bring the most important military force in the Middle East to its knees. Every drop of blood from the martyrs will grow into a child, and this child will grow into an adult, and this adult will fight Israel and become another martyr.''</p>
        <p>By late afternoon villagers had stormed the Khiam prison, which was run by the Israeli-backed militia and notorious internationally for reports of human rights abuses. The militia guards had run away, turning the prisoners over to the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials said they were surprised that the day had gone as peacefully as it had. They attributed that partly to the advance work of Hezbollah and Amal leaders. The guerrilla leaders had been spending time in Christian communities in the south, trying to convince them that all the people would stand together, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Over the years the guerrilla leaders have become part of the political establishment here, and they spoke today of using the moment to unite Lebanon's divided population.</p>
        <p>''Liberation is the gift of the resistance movement to the Lebanese people,'' said Nabih Berri, the speaker of Parliament and leader of Amal. ''It is especially a message to our Christian population in what was the occupied zone. They are part of us, no different from anyone else.''</p>
        <p>Lebanese political leaders said the military battle would now become a diplomatic one. They said they would fight for an Israeli pullout from the Shebaa Farms area at the foot of the Golan Heights, even though the United Nations said this week that it would certify the withdrawal as complete without it.</p>
        <p>''Whatever difficulties happen in life, after every one there is a catharsis, a joyous moment of release,'' Foda Ramadan, a returning villager, said today. ''And then there are new difficulties.''</p>
