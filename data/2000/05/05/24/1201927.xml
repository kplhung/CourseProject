        <p>The story of the uninspired student who goes on to make a name for himself is practically a cliche. Winston Churchill was a nortoriously poor test-taker. Martin Luther King Jr. scored below average on every section of the graduate school boards, including verbal aptitude. Like many other corporate leaders, Richard Branson of the Virgin Group had trouble with standardized admission tests.</p>
        <p>It is a paradox that has long frustrated educators. They know that test scores often predict applicants' academic performance on campus but are unreliable guides to career success. As a result, psychologists and corporate recruiters alike have longed for a systematic way to identify the campus goof-off who is destined to become a corporate chief executive or the class brain who is doomed to languish in middle management.</p>
        <p>Now, for what may be the first time, a major university is usings its own students and applicants in a concerted effort to unlock the mystery. In a challenge to the primacy of the standardized tests that millions of Americans have sweated over, the University of Michigan Business School is developing a test of practical intelligence, or common sense, that it hopes will do a better job of identifying future leaders than the Graduate Management Admission Test, or G.M.A.T., does.</p>
        <p>Michigan's new test leads students through an elaborate series of business scenarios that present hypothetical financial statements, press releases, news articles and other information. It then poses a central problem and asks students either open-ended or multiple-choice questions: What do you see as the main problem in this situation? What information did you focus on? What obstacles, if any, do you anticipate?</p>
        <p>The test aims to gauge who is able to learn from mistakes, handle changing situations and cope with less-than-perfect information - the same challenges, its designers say, that working people face every day.</p>
        <p>Michigan officials gave the test to M.B.A. students entering last fall, and they plan to do so again this year. The school will the compare the students' performance on the test to their track records at the school, from grades to extracurricular leadership positions to job offers, to see whether it is a valid measure of their ability to function in the workplace.</p>
        <p>Once the correlations are more clear, Michigan intends to require applicants to take the test, possibly as soon as the fall of 2001, in addition to the G.M.A.T.</p>
        <p>''We need a better, fairer, broader way of measuring people,'' said B. Joseph White, the dean for the last decade at Michigan, which is one of the country's most highly ranked business schools. ''We want to create an entirely new method of assessing incoming students for our M.B.A. program in order to spot people who are going to have the highest probability of being successful.''</p>
        <p>Mr. White says his ultimate goal is a yardstick that will become a standard tool for admissions officers at business schools around the country. ''There's some X factor that is critical to people's success that I don't think we or any top business school is measuring,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Outsiders say Michigan is fighting a difficult battle, even though some of its largest corporate recruiters say they think the test could be useful to them. Michigan could scare away some applicants by requiring them to take a second standardized test. And some people are skeptical that any form of test - as opposed to an interview, for example - can measure one's ability to interact with others, let alone the many variables that contribute to professional success. Determining the validity of such a test could take years and could be costly.</p>
        <p>''I certainly think it's a good endeavor, but it's very tough'' to develop a new test, said Paul Danos, dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.</p>
        <p>Still, the effort is a boon to the group of educational psychologists who have argued for years that the Scholastic Assessment Tests are too narrow a measure to determine admission to the country's best schools and who gets first chance at the best jobs when they graduate. Robert J. Sternberg, a professor of psychology at Yale University who is writing Michigan's new tests, says the traditional tests are ''not going to tell you who has good ideas.''</p>
        <p>''They're not going to tell you who is going to have practical ideas,'' he added. ''They're not going to tell who is going to get along wit the boss.''</p>
        <p>In the mid-1980's, Dr. Sternberg developed a concept he calls successful intelligence, or a combination of analystical, creative and practical intelligence. Solvig a math problem or breaking down an essay requires analytical intelligence. Figuring out how to perform a task efficiently or how to win over colleagues to a point of view often involves the creative and practical forms, he says.</p>
        <p>Over the last two decades, Dr. Sternberg has pointed to academic studies to argue that many people who display one form of intelligence lack the others. The ability of a range of workers, from garbage collectors to horse race handicappers, to solve problems as part of their jobs seems to have little to do with their scores on traditional standardized tests, according to the studies. Other psychologists disagree, saying that the connection between test scores and career success is significant.</p>
        <p>Over all, though, ''there is growing concern that the tests we have been using provide relatively weak indicators of longer-term success,'' said Michael J. Feuer, the executive director of the Center for Education, a division of the National Research Council in Washington. In 1997, for example, a study of doctors who had graduated during a 20-year span from the University of California at Davis found no difference in career success between students who had cause of affirmative action and those admitted because of their scores on the medical school boards.</p>
        <p>The debate over what intelligence tests should and do measure is nearly as old as the exams themselves. Alfred Binet, a French psychologist, invented the original version in 1905. As their use grew in the United States, researchers fiercely debated whether they were putting too much of a premium on academic skills, according to ''The Big Test: The Secret History of the American Meritocracy'' by Nicholas Lemann (Farrar Strauss &amp; Giroux, 1999), a history of testing.</p>
        <p>Corporate American has often split the difference. Companies recruit fast-track employees at elite universities that rely on standardized tests, yet the companies tend to promote workers for traits, like calmness under pressure and persuasiveness, that do not show up on paper.</p>
        <p>It is precisely these qualities that Dr. Sternberg and Mr. White say a written test can identify in a more rigorous way than interviews, essays or written recommendations can.</p>
        <p>That idea is the most disputed part of their effort.</p>
        <p>Executives say that a valid test of practical intelligence could be a valuable tool in making hiring decisions, particularly because of the speed with which managers must now make decisions. ''The biggest gap in organizations today, from top to bottom, is the ability to go from an idea to a decision to getting it done,'' said John N. Fox, the vice chairman of Deloitte Consulting and a member of Michigan's advisory board.</p>
        <p>The test, added Bruce W. Ferguson, the head of recruiting for the consulting division at Ernst &amp; Young, could help companies figure out which job a recruit is best suited for. ''It's not a silver bullet, but it becomes an additional data point,'' said Mr. Ferguson, whose firm's consulting division hires 200 M.B.A.'s a year.</p>
        <p>Even officials at the companies that administer the existing standardized tests say they are excited by the prospect of a test that tries to answer a different set of questions. ''I'm keenly interested to see what they learn here,'' said Howard T. Everson, the vice president for research at the College Board, which oversees the Scholastic Assessment Tests and other exams.</p>
        <p>Other business school deans remain skeptical that the new test will become a useful admission tool, though. The rationale for the test is that practical analysis is a skill that students inherently have or lack, said Donald P. Jacobs, the dean of the business school at Northwestern University. ''I think I can teach you how to be practical, to use theory to come to pracitical conclusions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the end, education experts say, Michigan's test will succeed or fail based on its ability to make meaningful judgments about students. The key question, Dr. Feuer of the National Research Council said, is ''What extent does this do a better job of predicting anything than the tests we currently have?''</p>
