        <p>Scott Rink's ''Of Melodrama and Murder'' got off to a smashing start on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>Lenna Parr portrayed an unhappy woman. And Jack Donahue presumably represented the man who made her so. As he started singing some of Kurt Weill's bitter songs of the 1920's and early 30's, Ms. Parr threw glasses at him and let them break against the walls and floor of the stage at Here, a performance space in SoHo.</p>
        <p>The production, presented by Mr. Rink's troupe, Dance Rink, was a cleverly assembled choreographic revue that featured songs and dances about broken hearts and shattered dreams. There were occasional bits of recorded accompaniment, but most of Weill's music was performed live by Mr. Donahue and Jono Mainelli, his capable pianist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Donahue commanded attention for the expressive way he made his singing voice lament, growl, snarl and implore as Weill's moods demanded. The dancing by Ms. Parr and Mr. Rink was also admirable.</p>
        <p>Usually they were cast as agonized lovers experiencing the death throes of romance. In one duet they confronted each other aggressively. Minutes later, Mr. Rink appeared to slit his wrists, only to recover. At the end of another duet, he turned into Jack the Ripper and slashed Ms. Parr.</p>
        <p>Then he launched into a frenzied solo. Near the end of the evening, he danced a sexually ambiguous and emotionally anxious solo in a dress.</p>
        <p>One tender duet added a bit of choreographic contrast. But because it was performed in underwear, it became faintly ridiculous. Like Weill, Mr. Rink had no romantic illusions.</p>
        <p>Given the disillusionment that pervaded the songs and dances, most of Jeff Fender's costumes were appropriately shabby. Even the fancier ones looked rumpled. ''Of Melodrama and Murder'' was a theatrical sketchbook that recalled the cynical satiric sketches of some of the German Expressionist artists.</p>
