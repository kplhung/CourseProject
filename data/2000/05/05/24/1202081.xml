        <p>Major League Baseball owners continue to struggle with realignment. As a result, Commissioner Bud Selig has indefinitely postponed an owners meeting scheduled for June13 and 14 in Detroit.</p>
        <p>Bud's plan doesn't have the votes, a baseball lawyer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The lawyer referred to a realignment plan that would put the Arizona Diamondbacks in the American League, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the National League, create four four-team N.L. divisions and a six-team A.L. Central, and have a wild-card team from the American but not from the National League.</p>
        <p>That plan is the one that has been most widely discussed, debated and criticized. But Selig has said repeatedly, most recently last Friday, that he has continued to study other possibilities. Selig was was unavailable to comment yesterday, but he told some owners he hoped to reschedule the meeting for late June or early July.</p>
        <p>Selig wants some form of realignment so that the leagues can switch from a balanced schedule to an unbalanced schedule, which would allow teams to play more games in their own divisions than they do now. Schedule makers say an unbalanced schedule would be unwieldy if the A.L. maintained its present format of two divisions of five teams and one of four.</p>
        <p>Jerry Colangelo, the managing partner of the Diamondbacks, has been the most vocal opponent of the prevailing plan, arguing that the Diamondbacks are a strong National League team and should remain there. But other owners have joined in the criticism.</p>
