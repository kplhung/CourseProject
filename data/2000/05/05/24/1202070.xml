        <p>A woman who owns an electronics store in Flushing, Queens, shot and critically injured a man as he drove off after robbing her store yesterday, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, Jose Colon, and two other men walked into Digital 2000 Communication at 60-04 Kissena Boulevard at 4:45 p.m., forced the owner to the back of the store, threw her to the floor and tried to tape her hands and mouth, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman.

        <p>A woman who owns an electronics store in Flushing, Queens, shot and critically injured a man as he drove off after robbing her store yesterday, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, Jose Colon, and two other men walked into Digital 2000 Communication at 60-04 Kissena Boulevard at 4:45 p.m., forced the owner to the back of the store, threw her to the floor and tried to tape her hands and mouth, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. He said that a witness told the police that one of the men hit the woman on the head with a cellular phone, and that it was unclear if the men were armed.</p>
        <p>One of the men took a black bag containing $20,000, while another stole several cell phones and other appliances, and all three ran out and jumped in a maroon Plymouth van, Detective Pentangelo said.</p>
        <p>He said that the woman ran after them and as the van drove off, fired two shots from a pistol, one of which struck Mr. Colon in the head.</p>
        <p>The police found the van half a mile away, at Rose Avenue and Bowne Street, with Mr. Colon in the driver's seat, bleeding profusely, Detective Pentangelo said. The money bag, with $17,171 of the $20,000 inside, was recovered, he added. The police were searching for the other men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colon, 37, of Corona, Queens, was in critical condition last night at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. He is charged with robbery and possession of stolen property, Detective Pentangelo said.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney's office said that a decision had not been made whether to charge the 27-year-old store owner. The spokeswoman, Mary DeBourbon, said that prosecutors were trying to confirm the woman's claim that the gun, a Glock 9-millimeter, is licensed. Under New York State law, a civilian may use deadly physical force to stop someone from fleeing after committing a robbery.</p>
        <p>The store owner was treated at St. Joseph's Hospital for stress and a head bruise, the police said.</p>
        <p>The owner of a computer store a few doors away from Digital 2000 on the busy commercial strip near Queens College described the woman as the kind of person who would bring back an extra cup of coffee for a neighbor if she went to Dunkin' Donuts.</p>
        <p>''She's a very decent, very friendly person,'' said Mamun Ahmed, the owner of the Computer Care Center, adding that he knew the woman only as Lily. ''You can't imagine a person like that being brave enough to strike back,'' he said.</p>
