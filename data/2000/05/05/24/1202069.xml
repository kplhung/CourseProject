        <p>Loyal to his players, attached to winning and defiant at the notion that the Knicks have gotten deep into his team's psyche, Pat Riley said today that he planned no major personnel shake-up for the Miami Heat next season.</p>
        <p>''The next time this team is stripped down and rebuilt, I won't be coaching it,'' Riley said after the team's final meeting of the season at American Airlines Arena.</p>
        <p>Riley acknowledged, however, that the Heat ''needs to become more athletic, and we will address that.'' The coach conceded that he would probably have to acquire another talented player or two for his team to advance further in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Last year, against a backdrop of cries from the fans and the news media for the coach to break up the Heat's nucleus after another elimination in the playoffs by the Knicks, Riley hinted that he would give his core players one more season together to prove their mettle. Today, he called for more patience.</p>
        <p>''We will have our opportunities again,'' he said. ''This game has proven to me that if you stay in it long enough, then you have your opportunities.''</p>
        <p>Although the Knicks eliminated the Heat on Sunday for the third straight season, Riley said there is nothing wrong with the Heat.</p>
        <p>Someone asked if the crushing disappointments against the Knicks had given Riley a sense that he no longer wanted to suffer this way after 18 season as a head coach in the National Basketball Association. He suddenly became animated.</p>
        <p>''Oh yes,'' Riley said, his voice rising steadily. ''I want to go through it again and again and again and again. I have no second thoughts.''</p>
