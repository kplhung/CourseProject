        <p>College enrollment will swell by some two million students -- to 19 million -- over the next 15 years, with black, Hispanic and Asian-American students accounting for 80 percent of the growth, according to a study scheduled for release today by the Educational Testing Service.</p>
        <p>The proportion of white students on campuses nationwide will drop from 71 percent in 1995 to 63 percent in 2015, the study predicts. Over that same 20-year stretch, Hispanic-Americans will increase their presence to 15 percent from 11 percent, and Asian-Americans to 8 percent from 5 percent, while African-American enrollment will remain steady at about 13 percent. Whites will be a minority on campuses by then in California, the District of Columbia, Hawaii and New Mexico, and, soon afterward, in Texas.</p>
        <p>''The fact that so many more minority students are opting for college is great news and underscores minority families' dedication to educating their children,'' Sonia Hernandez of the California Department of Education said in a statement accompanying the report. But Ms. Hernandez said colleges are unprepared to meet the demand and shifting demographics, both in terms of financial aid and academic programs. ''Celebrations are premature,'' she said. ''I am very worried that we could fail these children.''</p>
        <p>The surge in enrollment follows a steady climb over a half-century -- from 2.3 million students in 1947, to 10.2 million in 1974, to 14.3 million in 1997 and a predicted 19 million in 2015 -- and reflects the rise in births in the United States, increased immigration, and a growing sense that a college degree is a prerequisite for a decent job.</p>
        <p>Five states with large Hispanic populations -- Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas -- will account for more than half the overall increase in undergraduates over the next 15 years. California and Florida are each planning to build a new state university campus.</p>
        <p>But while minority college enrollment is skyrocketing, it is not growing as fast as the black and Hispanic populations ages 18 to 24. The study says that participation by blacks and Hispanics in higher education will actually decrease in proportion to their populations between 1995 and 2015.</p>
        <p>''We need to be careful that the growing numbers of minority students ready for college don't give us a false sense that we have achieved our diversity goals,'' said Richard A. Fry, a testing service economist and co-author of the report. Mr. Fry said that if black and Hispanic students attended college at the same rate as whites, the national economy would grow by $231 billion annually.</p>
        <p>Education experts said that they had been expecting the demographic shift, but that colleges and universities -- and the governments that supported them -- were unprepared. Among the challenges, they said, would be addressing the persistent ''achievement gap'' between white and Asian students and their black and Hispanic counterparts in high school; helping minority families, which are disproportionately poor, afford tuition; and fostering a climate of racial tolerance at historically white institutions.</p>
        <p>''There needs to be a fundamental shift in perspective about what educating students of color means,'' said Jamie Merisotis, director of the Institute for Higher Education Policy in Washington. ''We need to treat this as part of the mainstream, and not as an add-on.''</p>
        <p>Stanley O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, said his 3,500 member campuses have ''been working for a decade'' to diversify their student bodies and faculties and ''try to make themselves more comfortable places for students who have been underrepresented.''</p>
        <p>Anthony Lising Antonio, a professor of education at Stanford University who has studied the impact of diversity on college students, said that colleges would risk repeating the racial tensions of the late 1980's and early 1990's if they did not adjust their curriculums and programs to reflect their new students.</p>
        <p>''Whether they change their admissions practices or not, there's going to be these floods of students, and it's going to be a much more diverse place,'' Professor Antonio said. ''If we do nothing about it, you're not going to garner the benefits a diverse student body provides you.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Walker, director of admissions at the University of Texas at Austin, said that the burden was on the state's elementary and high schools to adequately prepare the newcomers for college. But he and others noted that the trend in recent years toward using tax credits and loans to help families finance higher education would need to be replaced with increased grant support.</p>
        <p>Scott Miller, the author of a recent College Board report documenting the achievement gaps among the races, said his analysis of test scores over the past decade showed that ''our capacity to integrate our most selective universities is not going to enhance very much over the next generation.''</p>
        <p>''Will more go to college? Yes. Will more graduate? Yes,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>''Will we close in a dramatic way, in the next generation, the college graduation rate gaps, and the achievement gaps when people get degrees?'' he continued. ''It may be that the only gains that will be made will be made through the sheer numbers.''</p>
