        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Eagles' Nest in Manhattan Irks Brooklyn'' (news article, May 18), about the issue of the placement of the eagle sculptures originally located in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn: The curatorship of city-owned art is a function of the Art Commission; it is not a function of the parks commissioner.</p>
        <p>Your readers will recall that the former head of the Art Commission resigned in 1998 over the park commissioner's installation of yardarm flagpoles without Art Commission approval, and that a settlement of the subsequent lawsuit between the two was resolved by the city's agreeing to submit the structures for review.  That dispute should have established the primacy of the Art Commission in these matters.</p>

        <p>The writer is an associate professor of law at Seton Hall University.</p>
