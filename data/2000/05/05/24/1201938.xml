        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In a May 18 letter about conflicts between the families of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson, Edna Bolling Jacques, a descendant of one of Sally Hemings's sisters, complains about my comment that ''we want our family to recognize us, to embrace us.'' My comment was cited in a May 14 article about a street being named for Hemings, my great-great-great-great-grandmother. Ms. Jacques says she's saddened to see Sally's descendants acting ''like grateful supplicants at the prospect of being recognized by the master's family.''</p>

        <p>It's too bad that Ms. Jacques and others want our family to stay divided. We have been separated for 200 years, and if she had her way, we would never come together.</p>
        <p>If we Hemingses and Jeffersons cannot heal the racial rift at the family level, what hope does this nation have?</p>
