        <p>Following are excerpts from the House debate today on the trade bill that would grant permanent normal trading relations with Beijing, as transcribed by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>NANCY PELOSI, DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA -- We have been told over the last decade that human rights in China would improve if we had unconditional trade benefits for China. Not so. More people are imprisoned for their beliefs in China today than at any time since the Cultural Revolution.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from the House debate today on the trade bill that would grant permanent normal trading relations with Beijing, as transcribed by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>NANCY PELOSI, DEMOCRAT OF CALIFORNIA -- We have been told over the last decade that human rights in China would improve if we had unconditional trade benefits for China. Not so. More people are imprisoned for their beliefs in China today than at any time since the Cultural Revolution.</p>
        <p>We were told that unconditional trade benefits for China would stop China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to rogue states. Again, not so. Not only does China continue to proliferate chemical, biological and nuclear technology and the delivery systems for them to rogue states, they have added Libya as one of their customers as recently as this March 2000.</p>
        <p>But even if we could ignore the serious repression and the dangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, there is serious reason to reject this proposal on the basis of trade alone. China has never honored any of its trade agreements with the United States, including its agreements for market access over the last 20 years -- over and over again -- agreements on stopping the violation of intellectual property and the piracy continues and stopping prison labor exports from coming into the United States. Indeed, the International Trade Commission said that in their own analysis projecting the China deal will result in the loss of 872,000 American jobs over the next decade.</p>
        <p>JIM KOLBE, REPUBLICAN OF ARIZONA -- I believe as important as the issues about trade and about human rights and economic advantages are, this issue is not really about China. It's about America. . . . International trade has connected our world's economies as never before, has made our people more dependent upon each other. This interconnectedness gives every nation a giant incentive to keep the peace. It's worked in the past. Just look at how far we've come. And it will work in the future, if the United States continues to lead.</p>
        <p>America cannot maintain its leadership role by refusing to trade with the world's largest economy. P.N.T.R. is in our economic self-interest. There can be no doubt about that. But it is also vital for peace and freedom throughout the world. If we choose to abdicate our leadership, consequences are dire. Will America continue to show, through the power of its example, that representative government and freed trade lead to stability, peace and prosperity?</p>
        <p>FRANK R. WOLF, REPUBLICAN OF VIRGINIA -- I'm a free-trader. I voted for Nafta. I was one of the 30 Republicans that voted to bomb Kosovo. So I'm kind of tired of the argument with regard to isolationist. What about the eight Catholic bishops? And now we know from the C.I.A. briefing there are more. What about the 50 evangelical pastors that are in jail? What about the over 400 Buddhist monks and nuns that have been persecuted and are suffering in that dirty jail in Lhasa? . . .What about the missiles directed against the United States? . . . If this Congress, a Republican Congress, votes to give M.F.N., we will be on the wrong side of the American people and we will be on the wrong side of history.</p>
        <p>SANDER M. LEVIN, DEMOCRAT OF MICHIGAN --  China's integration into the world trading system inevitably presents both opportunities and challenges. . . . But I want to focus right now on the challenges, because there are challenges as well as opportunities. One of them is the issue of compliance. There is weak rule of law today in China. How are we going to make sure that China complies with its agreements? Mr. [Doug] Bereuter [Republican of Nebraska] and I have put together legislation to address this challenge, as well as others. And there are some meaningful compliance provisions in our proposal. One relates to the U.S.T.R. review, an annual review within our own ranks. . . . The second one relates to the potential surges in products from China. . . . The third relates to human rights, including international core labor standards in the rule of law. First of all, in the legislation that Mr. Bereuter and I have proposed and will be before us tomorrow, what we do is to set up a task force, and a meaningful one, to pull together the agencies of the U.S. government to work with Customs to make sure that our law on forced imprisoned labor products from China, that that law is implemented. And then the commission that we have proposed, high-level, at the executive Congressional level, full time, fully staffed, patterned after the Helsinki Commission . . .</p>
        <p>Rejecting P.N.T.R. now that it's been combined with the proposals in our legislation would likely be a catalyst not for change, but for chaos in the relationships between the U.S. and China.</p>
