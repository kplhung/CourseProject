        <p>In their fight against granting China permanent normal trade relations, labor unions say they are trying to protect Americans from having to compete with foreign workers who are paid barely a living wage to work in inhumane conditions. But keeping China out of the global economy will actually hurt American factory workers more than it helps them.</p>
        <p>Consider my mother, who has been a garment worker in New York City for more than 20 years. Despite being a union member, she is paid the minimum wage or sometimes less. The factory she works in has little ventilation and dirty toilets. My father, who was a restaurant worker, is now 70 and unable to work, and my mother's income is essential. Fluctuating demand for American textiles has threatened to put my family in the streets. Already, several factory closings in Chinatown have forced her into dirtier and hotter factories.</p>

        <p>In their fight against granting China permanent normal trade relations, labor unions say they are trying to protect Americans from having to compete with foreign workers who are paid barely a living wage to work in inhumane conditions. But keeping China out of the global economy will actually hurt American factory workers more than it helps them.</p>
        <p>Consider my mother, who has been a garment worker in New York City for more than 20 years. Despite being a union member, she is paid the minimum wage or sometimes less. The factory she works in has little ventilation and dirty toilets. My father, who was a restaurant worker, is now 70 and unable to work, and my mother's income is essential. Fluctuating demand for American textiles has threatened to put my family in the streets. Already, several factory closings in Chinatown have forced her into dirtier and hotter factories.</p>
        <p>Yet my mother encourages me to buy goods made by companies accused of using sweatshops in third world countries. For years, I could not understand why she would do this instead of fighting the global market forces that could put her out of work. But the unfortunate paradox, I began to realize, is this: The products made in factories in developing countries are the only kind factory workers in this country can afford to buy.</p>
        <p>My parents and other Chinese immigrants constantly remind me how much more my generation has, living  in the United States. ''When I was growing up in China, we ate roast pig once a year during Chinese New Year,'' my father tells me. ''Now, we can eat roast pig every day.''</p>
        <p>Internet-ready computers, video games, Chinese candies, clothes, food, and woks are all made available and affordable by this country's open markets. Lower prices and imported goods may seem like frivolous benefits to many Americans, but to poor immigrant families, they mean a lot.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Chinese immigrants like my parents know all too well the consequences of living in an isolated society and closed economy. When I asked my mother why she left China for Hong Kong before coming to the United States, she said: ''Everybody was running to Hong Kong then. China was poor. China was Communist.''  As Hong Kong prospered and grew as a trading hub, China, closed off from the outside, continued to suffer from poverty, famine and political oppression.</p>
        <p>Opening China to the global market can only help reduce these conditions, which continue today. While an international labor standard would be useful, it is too idealistic and impractical, and mandated living wages would rob countries with cheap labor of the competitive advantage they need to lift their people out of poverty.</p>
        <p>The labor movement has done too little to improve my mother's workplace, and its current international fight seems misplaced. Squeezing globalization with the vise of protectionism helps neither American nor Chinese workers. If the labor movement wins its battle against so-called free trade, it will find the American working class suffering most.</p>
