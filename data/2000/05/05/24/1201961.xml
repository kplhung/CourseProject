        <p>THIS is not how my mother brought me up to address strangers, but circumstances argued for bluntness yesterday when I spoke with Hal Rosenbluth, the chief executive of Rosenbluth International, the big travel-management company.</p>
        <p>''Hal, are you nuts?'' I asked.</p>

        <p>THIS is not how my mother brought me up to address strangers, but circumstances argued for bluntness yesterday when I spoke with Hal Rosenbluth, the chief executive of Rosenbluth International, the big travel-management company.</p>
        <p>''Hal, are you nuts?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>There was a chortle on the other end of the phone. ''Well, I've always been a contrarian,'' Mr. Rosenbluth replied.</p>
        <p>Let me explain the rude question, which was also echoing throughout the travel industry yesterday. Rosenbluth International, through its Rosenbluth Interactive subsidiary, owns an online travel company called Biztravel.com. Yesterday, in full-page newspaper ads, Biztravel.com trumpeted the audacious announcement that travelers who booked tickets through its site on any of five major airlines would receive cash refunds whenever those flights arrived at the gate more than 30 minutes late.</p>
        <p>The refund is $100 for a late arrival of more than 30 minutes. If the flight gets into the gate over an hour late, the refund is $200. More than two hours late, the full ticket price is refunded. The guarantee covers tickets purchased through Biztravel.com for flights on American Airlines,  Continental Airlines, US Airways, British Airways and Air France.</p>
        <p>Given routine delays, and especially considering predictions that a record volume of travelers will severely strain the air travel system during the coming summer season, couldn't this add up to real money?</p>
        <p>''We'll be paying out a good amount of cash, I'm sure,'' Mr. Rosenbluth said. ''But I believe that the airlines, particularly the ones we selected, are doing their best to get their planes off on time.''</p>
        <p>Besides refunding money for late flights, the Biztravel.com guarantee covers seat assignments ($25 for domestic and $50 for international passengers who arrive on time and don't get their designated seat assignment) and meal service in first and business classes ($25 if you don't get your choice of the available entrees). Biztravel.com is also offering various refunds tied to performance on its own online and telephone customer service operations.</p>
        <p>The offer is, clearly, a carefully considered marketing gimmick. The intention, Mr. Rosenbluth said, is to recruit and retain new clients among individual business travelers and especially in the rapidly growing business-travel market among small companies. The costs to Biztravel.com, which Mr. Rosenbluth estimated will be in the ''hundreds of thousands'' this year rather than millions of dollars, are really marketing expenses for acquiring new customers who will be attracted enough by the potential financial incentives to actually book through the site.</p>
        <p>Though it is intended for business travelers, anyone can use the Biztravel.com site and qualify for the refunds.</p>
        <p>The strategy addresses the online travel industry's disappointing ''look-to-book ratio,'' a frustration for all online travel companies, including the major mass-market sites like Expedia.com and Travelocity.com, which spend heavily on advertising and promotion to build big  customer bases. Large numbers of people use online sites to obtain airfare, hotel and other information -- but then actually go offline to book their travel, either directly with airlines and hotels or through traditional travel agents.</p>
        <p>In the last year, Biztravel.com has been rapidly expanding its small-business travel base with a technology called biztravel@mycompany, which provides corporate customers with a customized intranet site where employees can book business travel online but also have 24-hour-a-day access to live customer service representatives from the parent company, Rosenbluth International. Rosenbluth is planning to expand that service within a few weeks with the start of a new leisure-travel link, travelution.com, that will enable those corporate clients also to book personal leisure travel on the company intranet.</p>
        <p>Besides the big third-party sites, airlines have their own online sites -- and a group of major airlines is now gearing up for the expected imminent start-up of a mega online booking site that is still only known by a working name, T-2. But Mr. Rosenbluth said his company was ''putting our money where our mouth is'' in a bet that a big chunk of the online travel market could be claimed by a site like Biztravel.com that is augmented by a telephone network of customer service agents who can assist with more complicated arrangements and on-the-road problems.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Biztravel.com plans to start a monthlong ad campaign next week promoting its cash-for-delays offer on the CNN Airport Network. That means that travelers cooling their heels in airport lounges after a delayed connecting flight will be getting a message that ''if you'd purchased your ticket at Biztravel.com, you could be getting a refund right now,'' said Mr. Rosenbluth, again with that chortle.</p>
        <p>In another indication of accelerating growth in the online business-travel market, GetThere.com, a major provider of technological systems for the business-to-business travel procurement market, announced plans to start a service called GetThere Supplier Network. It will link corporate travel purchasers directly to a network of airlines (United Airlines, British Air, T.W.A. and Northwest Airlines have joined so far); hotel companies (Radisson, Marriott, Starwood, Candlewood, Accor and Cendant) and car-rental companies (Hertz, Avis and Budget).  The strategy is to allow companies to use multiple online links to better leverage the business-travel marketplace, both to cut costs and to improve efficiency, the company said.</p>
        <p>Flying on business this weekend? Stand by for heavy crowds. During the Memorial Day holiday period, flights will be most crowded on Friday, with about 87 percent of all seats full, the Air Transport Association estimates.</p>
        <p>But leaving tomorrow to beat the crush won't gain you much because flights will be 85 percent full then, the trade group says. All other things being equal, Sunday is the best travel day of the holiday period, when flights should be only 66 percent full.</p>
