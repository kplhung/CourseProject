        <p>For the first time in more than two months, Eric Lindros has been given medical clearance to play hockey.</p>
        <p>After Lindros participated in a brief practice session with his teammates here today, Philadelphia Flyers Coach Craig Ramsay announced that Lindros -- who has suffered five concussions in two years -- will be in the lineup Wednesday against the Devils in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference finals at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>Asked about the possibility of suffering a grave injury by playing, Lindros said, ''Anytime you play the game, freak things happen. I've been medically cleared to play.''</p>
        <p>Lindros has been sidelined since March 13 because of recurrent concussions. ''I put a lot of time into my decision,'' Coach Craig Ramsay said. ''It was a tough decision, a hard decision. I wanted to be fair to everyone. But Eric said all the right things. He seemed very sincere in his desire to come back. He's been a big part of this team for a long time. I felt he deserved that opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Having said that, and with his team just one victory away from a berth in the Stanley Cup finals, Ramsay imposed a gag order on the rest of his players, who stripped Lindros of his captaincy on March 27. After Sunday night's 4-1 loss to New Jersey in Philadelphia, which brought the Devils to within three-games-to-two in the four-of-seven-game series, many of the Flyers did not seem enthusiastic about Lindros's return.</p>
        <p>''Eric has talked to some of the players,'' Ramsay said. ''We didn't demand that he stand up there and beg. This was between the coaches and the players. And I have instructed the rest of the players to have no comment. You've heard from Eric and from me. It's a team decision. Everybody supported it. And we're not going to deal with this anymore. We've said what we had to say. The issue is closed to the rest of the players. Otherwise, it's going to just drive us crazy.''</p>
        <p>Because of the multiple concussions Lindros has sustained -- three in the last year, two since March 4 -- there are those who think he would be risking his long-term health.</p>
        <p>When asked about the dangers of coming back to a series that his teammate, John LeClair, has already said is the bloodiest he has ever been part of, Lindros said, ''It's a physical series and I look forward to being part of it.''</p>
        <p>Ramsay made sure to stress that Lindros will have to earn his time on the ice.</p>
        <p>''He understands that, he accepts that,'' said Ramsay.</p>
        <p>''We've talked about his role, what he can do, what will be best for him. It will be a limited role, but we feel he will be a great addition to the club. We'll see how it goes once the game gets started. We're excited to have him back.''</p>
        <p>Some more than others. But Lindros seemed earnest when he indicated that he will do anything his coach and teammates ask of him, including fit into the unselfish system that they have played in Lindros' absence.</p>
        <p>''I think I can help out,'' Lindros said. ''Obviously, I'm not going to play 18 to 25 minutes a game. It will be a much lighter role than that. I'm just getting back into it.''</p>
        <p>Ramsay said he wouldn't initially put Lindros out on the power play. ''But I would imagine he'd get some power play time,'' Ramsay said.</p>
        <p>When asked what Lindros brings to the Flyers, Rick Tocchet said, ''Obviously, the shot. And it's going to give somebody else that extra second somewhere on the ice.''</p>
        <p>Off the ice, however, Lindros brings baggage. Lindros, who almost certainly will be traded by the Flyers after the playoffs end, has been embroiled in a season-long series of disputes with the Philadelphia General Manager Bob Clarke. And Lindros's health has been just one of a number of off-ice incidents, including Ramsay's succession of the ailing Roger Neilson and the stripping of Lindros's captaincy in favor of Eric Desjardins, that have dogged the team.</p>
        <p>When asked if the Lindros saga continues to be a distraction, Ramsay answered sarcastically, ''Nooooooo.''</p>
        <p>''Our team has had to deal with everything imaginable,'' Ramsay said. ''I've been in this game almost 30 years and I've never seen anything happen as to what has happened to this team. And I've also never seen a better response.''</p>
        <p>Part of the reason has been the Flyers ability to come together in Lindros's absence.</p>
        <p>''But the most important thing we have to focus on is that we're 60 minutes away from the Stanley Cup final,'' said Desjardins. ''And nothing can come in and distract us from that.''</p>
        <p>Not even Lindros. Or so the Flyers hope.</p>
