        <p>IT has been more than 40 years since anyone has shoved Evan Davis off a cliff.</p>
        <p>That last time, Mr. Davis, who was 10, was playing with the Riverside Rangers, his school buddies in Greenwich, Conn., when a rival faction challenged them viciously over a makeshift fort.</p>
        <p>''They pushed my wheelchair off a six-foot cliff with me in it,'' recalls Mr. Davis, whose legs were withered by polio, contracted when he was 5. ''It reminded me that it's important to surround yourself with a network of people who can come to your aid.</p>
        <p>''I also remember thinking about the injustice of it,'' he adds, with a rueful smile. ''What better lesson was there for a lawyer to learn?''</p>
        <p>That ability to draw people to him, combined with a palpable sense of fair play, have marked the ebullient Mr. Davis's life as a public and private lawyer. And if he has not, metaphorically speaking, been shoved off a cliff since, perhaps that is because he can be impossible to move off a position once he has staked it out.</p>
        <p>Consider (briefly) campaign finance reform. Mr. Davis, who took a leave from his big-ticket Wall Street practice to serve as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's counsel, living in a $47-a-night Albany motel for five years, worried mightily at the issue, but failed to persuade legislators that severely limiting political contributions was a thing of beauty.</p>
        <p>But campaign finance reform apparently gets into some people's blood. Eight years later, having become a first-time husband at 51 and just after becoming a first-time father at 53, Mr. Davis did the daffy thing. He took another leave from his firm, Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton, where he is a $560-an-hour litigator, with clients like the Museum of Modern Art and the American Museum of Natural History. He ran in the Democratic primary for state attorney general on a holier-than-thou promise of limiting contributions to $2,500 (the state limit is $13,400) and refusing to telephone wealthy potential donors.</p>
        <p>He raised $750,000 and came in last. ''I feel proud that 70,000 people voted for me,'' Mr. Davis, 56, says cheerfully. ''That's enough to fill a sports stadium!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis does not get angry, he gets even. After the primary, he dusted himself off and helped start New York Fair Elections Project, which studies campaign financing. And now, having been installed yesterday as president of the 130-year-old Association of the Bar of the City of New York, which represents 21,000 lawyers, Mr. Davis is expected to use that powerful pulpit for another go at his favorite greased pig.</p>
        <p>''The legislators will just say we're a 'goo-goo' organization,'' says Mr. Davis, who was also in the Lindsay  mayoral administration. ''But the lawmaking there is terribly warped, so I'll respond on the merits.''</p>
        <p>HE has always been inventively tenacious. In the early years of living with his wheelchair, ''I recall being frustrated at not being able to do something,'' says Mr. Davis, during a recent visit at the city bar, ''so my tendency was to figure out a way to do it.''</p>
        <p>He has traveled to Iran, India, New Zealand, Scandinavia and Tanzania. Shanghai, too, where he and his wife, Mary Rothwell Davis, the lawyer he met and married six months later, went twice to adopt their daughters: Sara, 4, and Charlotte, 17 months.</p>
        <p>When the girls were tiny, he was nervous about being alone with them in case of a fire. Could he carry them to safety? They're older now and he is more assured. He takes out snapshots: ''Charlotte comes in waving a  new diaper, just wanting to be sure Daddy understands what is needed,'' Mr. Davis says, blue eyes crinkling. ''I got the point.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo says Mr. Davis reminds him of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ''although Evan has a better mind, but they both have that fantastic ability to project confidence, enthusiasm and joie de vivre, no matter what.''</p>
        <p>As a child, unable to play sports, he was always picked to be umpire. Friends pushed his chair on Boy Scout hikes and elected him class president. In the eighth grade, when he spent a year at home recuperating from spinal surgery, teachers stopped by daily to tutor him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, who has a ravenous, restless intellect as well as a sturdy ego, figured out early that he didn't need to back down from the usual suspects. After graduating from Harvard and then Columbia Law School, where he was editor in chief of the law review, he won a Supreme Court clerkship, working with Justice Potter Stewart. There, while he secured his lifelong embrace of the law and lawyering, he realized that Mount Olympus didn't exist.</p>
        <p>''You learn not to be intimidated,'' he says. ''I was the valet, and to the valet, no one is a hero. Of course,  there's always someone who will intimidate you because of chemistry. It could be the guy at the local service station. But not just because of someone's position.''</p>
        <p>That refusal to be intimidated can be a great asset to a lawyer. Two weeks after his 30th birthday, Mr. Davis went to Washington to direct the House Judiciary Committee's team investigating President Nixon's Watergate cover-up.</p>
        <p>But at the start of Mr. Davis's years with Mr. Cuomo, legislators found him high-handed and hard-headed. In time, he became a skillful negotiator, a lion of the bar known for his ability to resolve disputes.</p>
        <p>''In Albany I learned that nothing good comes out of yelling and screaming,'' he says, ''and people pushing people off of cliffs.''</p>
