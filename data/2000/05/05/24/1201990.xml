        <p>Probing Questions From Young Minds</p>

        <p>Probing Questions From Young Minds</p>
        <p>Never sit next to PEGGY SIEGAL, the hard-charging, never-take-no-for-an-answer public relations executive. A. SCOTT BERG, the Charles Lindbergh biographer, did so at a dinner last month, and ended up agreeing to speak at her niece's graduation.</p>
        <p>''Normally, I don't do elementary schools,'' Mr. Berg said, but this one had more going for it than Ms. Siegal. It was the Elisabeth Morrow School in Englewood, N.J. Its campus includes the house in which Charles A. Lindbergh married Anne Morrow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berg sounded as if he enjoyed himself. ''They had the best questions of any group I've ever talked to: why did Charles Lindbergh turn down all the money and why wasn't he happy being famous?'' he said. ''They could see in the film footage I showed that he was scowling through the parades. Then one of the kids said, 'How did Lindbergh get home from Paris?' Great question. The answer is, he came home on a ship. Coolidge was afraid to let him fly home because he was afraid he'd lose him.''</p>
        <p>A Plea Agreement And a Damage Suit</p>
        <p>The rock star CHRISSIE HYNDE accepted a plea deal yesterday for her arrest during an animal-rights demonstration on March 9. She and three other protesters from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals were arrested after they began cutting leather jackets in a Gap store at 48th Street and Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan. Ms. Hynde was protesting what she said was the Gap chain's policy of using leather that was obtained by ''illegally and cruelly'' slaughtering cows in India.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, prosecutors offered, and she accepted, an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal: the charge will be dropped if she does not get into trouble with the law for a year. As she left the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building surrounded by PETA members, she waved at photographers and said, ''Free at last.'' But she has not been in jail since her release on March 10, the day after she was arrested.</p>
        <p>A former nanny for ANNA WINTOUR, the editor in chief of Vogue magazine, filed a lawsuit yesterday, alleging that she suffered brain damage from paint remover used after anti-fur protesters sprayed on Ms. Wintour's town house. The former nanny, LORI FELDT, said she was rendered unconscious by fumes from the paint remover when Ms. Wintour sent workers to clean away the protesters' red paint on Dec. 2, 1997.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, named Conde Nast -- the publisher of Vogue and Ms. Wintour's employer -- as the only defendant. It seeks $50 million in damages. Ms. Feldt's lawyer, D. CARL LUSTIG III, said he believed the workers who applied the paint thinner were Conde Nast employees; also, he said, Ms. Feldt was barred from suing Ms. Wintour under the New York State worker's compensation law. A spokesman for Vogue, PATRICK O'CONNELL, did not return a call yesterday. He told The Associated Press that Conde Nast had no comment.</p>
        <p>A Day of Fashion, A Night of Song</p>
        <p>The fashion designer DENNIS BASSO had a long day on Monday -- a show at the Pierre Hotel in the afternoon and a dinner and dance at Rainbow Cipriani in Rockefeller Center in the evening. After the dinner and before the dance, Mr. Basso brought out NEIL SEDAKA, and soon a lot of lip synching was going on: Mr. Sedaka sang along with several of his own recordings.</p>
        <p>At one table CATHERINE SAXTON, a public relations executive, observed, ''This really is the ultimate karaoke.''</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Sedaka introduced NATALIE COLE. Singing with her own recordings, she performed ''Unforgettable'' and ''Living for Love,'' which she wrote with GARY HENRY and DENISE RICH.</p>
        <p>''Living for Love'' is so new that it has not been released yet. ''They made me give up the key to my suite so they could go in and get the CD out of the CD player,'' Miss Cole said. Someone pointed out that Miss Cole had been a hit modeling at the fashion show. ''I rehearsed that one,'' she said.</p>
