        <p>A LOT of investors who thought they knew a bargain when they saw one bought US Airways stock over the years, only to discover that cheap stocks can get cheaper.</p>
        <p>Now those who held on can feel at least some vindication. The UAL Corporation is expected to announce that it will acquire US Airways for $60 a share in cash, more than twice the $25.9375 price of the shares.</p>
        <p>Still, that is not exactly a bonanza for some longtime investors. This is a stock that traded above $50 a share in the 1980's and above $80 in 1998. US Airways is one of the few major companies whose share prices ended the 1990's lower than they were at the end of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>For much of that time, US Airways appeared to be cheap compared with other airlines. But although it had its runs, most recently in 1998 when profits soared, bad news usually followed and the stock price came back down.</p>
        <p>What went wrong? There were labor problems and low-cost competitors. The airline was hampered by a reliance on relatively short-haul travel in the East, where weather and traffic congestion can increase costs. Its partnership with British Airways -- an arrangement that led it to change its name from USAir to one that was closer to that of its partner -- dissolved in bitterness after the British airline decided that it would rather pair with the larger and stronger American Airlines.</p>
        <p>If UAL's takeover of US Airways is completed -- and it will undoubtedly face antitrust issues and perhaps opposition from American, with whom US Airways has frequent-flier arrangements that would have to be undone -- it will be good news for the investors in the Tiger Management hedge funds that were run by Julian H. Robertson Jr.</p>
        <p>The funds own nearly a quarter of US Airways, having bought most of the shares in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robertson decided early this year to close his hedge funds after his investments had badly lagged the overall stock market as he stayed out of technology stocks whose prices struck him as excessive.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, however, Mr. Robertson concluded that his largest positions would be too hard to liquidate, and his funds held on to those shares to see what developed. If the deal is completed, those funds, with 16.5 million shares of US Airways, will take in $991 million, a figure that is $562 million more than the market value of the shares at yesterday's close.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Robertson is not completely vindicated. Though most of the shares were acquired in 1996, at prices under $20 each, a few of them were bought later at prices that might have exceeded $50 each.</p>
        <p>It does not appear, however, that Mr. Robertson bought any US Airways shares at or near the top, which was reached in 1998 when the stock's price climbed to $83.25. From then through yesterday's close, US Airways stock lost 69 percent of its value while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was rising 19 percent.</p>
        <p>Another well-known investor who came to regret placing a bet on US Airways was Warren E. Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway invested $358 million in US Airways convertible preferred stock in 1989, when the stock was trading at around $53 a share.</p>
        <p>That was widely seen as an anti-takeover move by US Airways, putting voting power in friendly hands. If so, it worked. The company was not taken over.</p>
        <p>It was not a brilliant move by Mr. Buffett, although it worked out adequately in the end. The dividends were not paid for a couple of years, although they were eventually made up. Berkshire converted the shares to common stock in 1998 and sold most of them quickly, probably getting more than it would have if it had held on.</p>
        <p>Secrecy is one thing that appears to have been accomplished in the UAL-US Airways merger discussions. Shares of US Airways closed at $25.9375, up 68.75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, although one late trade, for just 100 shares, was reported last night at $26.3125. Volume was relatively low.</p>
        <p>Moreover, there was little action in the options market. There was some volume in one US Airways call option early yesterday, but little in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>UAL shares, which may come under pressure today even as US Airways shares are rising, rose 62.5 cents, to $60.375. Word of the deal did not reach news agencies until after 6 p.m., when markets were closed.</p>
