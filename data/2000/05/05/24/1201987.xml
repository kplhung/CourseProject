        <p>Responding to Gov. George W. Bush's criticism of the Clinton administration's policies on Israel, Vice President Al Gore today accused Mr. Bush's father of trying to pressure Israel to adopt positions it strongly opposed during his presidency.</p>
        <p>In a speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel lobbying group, Mr. Gore criticized the former president, George Bush, for seeking to withhold American loan guarantees to Israel in 1991 unless it agreed to stop building new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He called that policy an ''insulting concept'' intended ''to bully'' Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also told the crowd of 2,000 people that in 1988, as a senator from Tennessee, he had opposed a Reagan administration plan to get Israel to take part against its wishes in a peace conference involving the Soviet Union and Arab nations.</p>
        <p>''I stood against the efforts of the two previous administrations to pressure Israel to take stands against its own view of what was in Israel's best interest,'' Mr. Gore said to warm applause. ''When a friend's survival is potentially at stake, you don't pressure that friend to take steps that it believes are clearly contrary to what is in that friend's best interests.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore made his remarks a day after Governor Bush, the likely Republican nominee for president, used a speech before the same organization to accuse the Clinton administration of trying ''to make Israel conform to its own plans and timetables.'' The governor also asserted that the administration had taken sides in the most recent Israeli election by supporting Ehud Barak in his victorious campaign over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
        <p>In his comments today, Mr. Gore did not mention Governor Bush. But he made repeated references to Presidents Reagan and Bush, at one point asserting that both men took a hands-off approach to Middle East policy.</p>
        <p>''When we took office almost eight year ago, President Clinton and I decided that the United States needed to chart a new course with regard to the Middle East peace process,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Unlike our immediate predecessors, we chose to get intimately involved.''</p>
        <p>And he reminded the crowd of President Bush's failure to oust  President Saddam Hussein of Iraq in  the Persian Gulf war of 1991. ''You know as well as I know that as long as Saddam Hussein stays in power, there can be no comprehensive peace for the people of Israel or the people of the Middle East,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>After the speech, Mr. Gore flew to the annual convention of the Service Employees International Union in Pittsburgh, where he continued his attack on Mr. Bush's proposal to allow taxpayers to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush contends that private investment accounts would allow taxpayers to take advantage of booming markets and help stabilize the system, which is projected to become insolvent in 2037. But Mr. Gore argues that privatization, as he calls it, would bankrupt the system.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Gore told the 1.4-million-member union, which has endorsed him, that Mr. Bush's plan presented a ''special risk'' for service workers because the government might be forced to increase the retirement age to finance it. Mr. Bush denies that.</p>
        <p>''I don't care what the actuarial tables say about people living longer, when somebody who is working in hard physical-labor jobs get to the present retirement age, they shouldn't be told they have to keep working until they are 70 years old,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The Bush privatization plan doesn't just open the door to raising the retirement age, it practically rolls out a red carpet for the idea.''</p>
