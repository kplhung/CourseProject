        <p>Declaring that the nation's security no longer required ''a nuclear balance of terror,'' Gov. George W. Bush called today for new -- and possibly unilateral -- reductions in American nuclear weapons coupled with a robust antimissile defense system.</p>
        <p>Though he shied from specifics, Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the size of the United States' nuclear arsenal to the ''lowest possible number consistent with our national security'' and below the levels called for under the Start II accord with Russia.</p>

        <p>Declaring that the nation's security no longer required ''a nuclear balance of terror,'' Gov. George W. Bush called today for new -- and possibly unilateral -- reductions in American nuclear weapons coupled with a robust antimissile defense system.</p>
        <p>Though he shied from specifics, Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the size of the United States' nuclear arsenal to the ''lowest possible number consistent with our national security'' and below the levels called for under the Start II accord with Russia.</p>
        <p>''We should not keep weapons that our military planners do not need,'' he said, flanked by foreign policy experts from four Republican administrations. ''These unneeded weapons are the expensive relics of dead conflicts.''</p>
        <p>Asked at a news conference whether that meant he would reduce the nation's nuclear arsenal unilaterally, Mr. Bush said, ''Yes.'' But then he quickly added, ''I would work closely with the Russians to convince them to do the same.'' And he said, ''I would never do anything to put our  nation at risk.'' [Excerpts, Page A21.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, accompanied his call for nuclear weapons reductions with a full-throated endorsement of a far more expansive  missile defense system than that being explored by the Clinton administration. He said he wanted to examine all options for a global system including ''whether or not a space-based system can work.''</p>
        <p>''America must build effective missile defenses,'' Mr. Bush said, ''based on the best available options at the earliest possible date. Our missile defense must be designed to protect all 50 states and our friends and allies and deployed forces overseas from missile attacks by rogue nations or accidental launches.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's lack of experience in foreign policy is one of his biggest political vulnerabilities, and he has been making a concerted drive in recent days to speak out on national security issues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's appearance today was unlike any event that preceded it in this campaign. In contrast to previous policy speeches, his audience consisted only of several dozen Washington reporters gathered in the National Press Club. His speech was relatively short, and much of his time was devoted to answering questions.</p>
        <p>To give himself added authority, Mr. Bush spoke while flanked by five prominent experts in national security: Henry A. Kissinger, George P. Shultz, Brent Scowcroft, Colin L. Powell and Donald H. Rumsfeld, several of whom voiced support of Mr. Bush's ideas. The result was some strange political symbolism as Mr. Bush called for new thinking for a new post-cold-war era, surrounded by some of the architects of the nation's cold-war arms control treaties.</p>
        <p>Although President Clinton has signaled his willingness to negotiate further weapons cuts with Russia, Mr. Bush accused the administration of being ''locked in a cold-war mentality'' on arms control. That was virtually the same charge Vice President Al Gore used against Mr. Bush just a few weeks ago. At that time Mr. Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said Mr. Bush was ''stuck in a cold-war mind-set'' and cited his advocacy of a global missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Gore's aides sharply criticized Mr. Bush, saying his approach to nuclear security was unrealistic, that it would not be accepted by the Russians and that it would would undermine years of arms control agreements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers pointed to Mr. Bush's opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and said the governor advocates the radical rewriting, if not outright abolition, of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
        <p>''Bush's agenda is irresponsible and shows that he lacks the depth of experience to keep America safe and secure,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said he would pull out of the pact if the Russians did not agree to adjust it after ''a reasonable amount of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, like Mr. Clinton, favors negotiating with the Russians to change the antiballistic missile treaty and make way for the more limited missile defense system.</p>
        <p>With his speech, Mr. Bush aligned himself with a group of foreign policy thinkers who have started to ask whether traditional arms control agreements are suited to the post-cold-war era.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Bush sidestepped a host of questions today by saying that as president he would order his defense secretary to conduct an assessment of the nuclear force structure and only then decide how many nuclear weapons the nation needed.</p>
        <p>The governor also said he would ask for an assessment of what the nation could do to lower the alert status of its forces. ''Preparation for quick launch -- within minutes after warning of an attack -- was the rule during the era of superpower rivalry,'' he said. ''But today for two nations at peace, keeping so many weapons on high alert may create unacceptable risks of accidental or unauthorized launch.''</p>
        <p>The 1993 Start II accord, which was recently ratified by the Russian parliament, called for Russia and the United States to slash their arsenals to 3,000 to 3,500 long-range weaponsfrom 6,000.</p>
        <p>President Clinton and former President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia also set a framework in 1997 for a new round of Start III negotiations to reduce arsenals to 2,000 to 2,500 weapons. Moscow wants to go further and has called for both sides to cut to 1,500 long-range weapons.</p>
        <p>Pressed on whether he supported the Start III framework, Mr. Bush said he would decide what level of warheads was sufficient only after consultations with his defense secretary and the military.</p>
        <p>His chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said later that it was ''conceivable, I suppose, but unlikely'' that a military review could end up recommending weapons levels higher than some of the numbers being contemplated in the Start III negotiations.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush contemplates reducing the nuclear arsenal to less than 2,000 to 2,500 weapons, he could well face resistance from the military.</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill today, the Joint Chiefs of Staff said they opposed reducing the United States nuclear arsenal below those levels, though their words were not aimed at Mr. Bush. They appeared at a hearing called by Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, as a pre-emptive strike against any efforts by the administration to use lower nuclear arms cuts with Russia to win agreement on limited missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush portrayed his drive for an expansive missile defense system as one that would protect not just the United States but its allies against accidental missile launchings, terrorist strikes or rogue nations. He said that he would share the technology with Europe and Israel and that he might consider sharing it with Russia, depending on ''how Russia behaves.''</p>
        <p>''Russia, our allies in the world need to understand our intentions,'' he said. ''America's development of missile defenses is a search for security, not a search for advantage.''</p>
        <p>The Russians have made clear that they adamantly oppose renegotiating the ABM treaty to allow the American deployment of a missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush insisted that he could afford a robust antimissile defense system along with two other things for which he has called: a $1.3 trillion tax cut and billions of new dollars in spending on social programs and additional tax incentives. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that it would cost $60 billion to build a land-based system that would include 250 missile interceptors at two sites.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is interested in a missile defense system far more wide ranging than one Mr. Clinton is examining. Ms. Rice said in an interview that he wants to look at ''all options'' including defense from land, from sea or from space.</p>
        <p>Leon Fuerth, the national security adviser to Mr. Gore, argued today that the more limited system being examined by the Clinton administration could be in place by 2005 in time to face a possible threat from North Korea. He said Mr. Bush's effort to ''tear up all the technology and start all over again'' would set back development and leave the United States vulnerable to rogue states.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush did not mention his father in his speech today, but he clearly had him in mind as a model when he spoke of the possibility of arms reductions carried out without  ''years and years of detailed arms control negotiations.''</p>
        <p>He used 1991 as an example of the kinds of steps he was advocating. That was the year when President George Bush unilaterally took all American strategic bombers off alert status. He also removed American short-range nuclear weapons from Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>Russia promptly followed suit. The Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pulled Moscow's own short-range missiles back to Russia and promised to cut back the Soviet nuclear arsenal.</p>
        <p>In talking with reporters, Governor Bush said he had consulted with Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Shultz and the others with him on the policy he was advocating. And he said all had agreed to advise him in the future. But most attention focused on Mr. Powell, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Persian gulf war of 1991 and who many Republicans would like to see as a vice-presidential candidate. Mr. Powell has said he is not interested in the job. ''The answer's well known,'' he said today. ''I won't take any time away from the governor to belabor you with'' being nominated as vice president.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he had discussed with Mr. Powell the possibility of a  Cabinet post like secretary of state, Mr. Bush shot back to reporters, ''I'm not going to tell you what I talk to him about.''</p>
