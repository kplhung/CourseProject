        <p>Say ''height limits'' and most New Yorkers probably imagine lopping a few dozen floors off a skyscraper in the middle of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But the objections expressed yesterday to the Giuliani administration's ambitious citywide rezoning proposal, which includes height limits, came from a hospital in Washington Heights, a film studio in Long Island City, Queens, and the developer of a mixed-use project in Flushing, Queens.</p>
        <p>At a City Planning Commission hearing, the debate over the proposal -- which has been conducted for the last five months largely on a theoretical, hypothetical plane -- began to move in a more concrete direction.</p>
        <p>The commission is to vote this summer on the rezoning, known as the Unified Bulk Program because it would place more consistent controls on the height and massing of new buildings, favoring lower structures that fill in street fronts rather than towers rising from isolated plazas. Height limits of 35 feet to 720 feet would apply to most areas outside mid-Manhattan and Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The measure is to be considered later this year by the City Council.</p>
        <p>Civic groups, community planning boards and professional organizations like the American Planning Association and American Institute of Architects generally support the proposal, and a number of them appeared yesterday to reiterate their endorsements.</p>
        <p>The real estate industry generally opposes the rezoning. But the most outspoken objection yesterday came from the Greater New York Hospital Association.</p>
        <p>''The proposed Unified Bulk Program, while perhaps laudatory for its overriding goals, will have a disparate and disastrous impact on community facilities such as hospitals, research and education facilities, and continuing-care facilities,'' said Susan C. Waltman, senior vice president and general counsel of the association, which represents 175 institutions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Waltman said floor heights in medical buildings were necessarily greater than in residential structures because they must house operating rooms, special equipment, auditoriums and patient areas with extensive electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilating and air-conditioning systems. Under an absolute height cap, that means fewer floors on a given site.</p>
        <p>Without identifying them by name, Ms. Waltman said one institution would have to eliminate 45 percent of the space it planned in a new building and another would have to reduce a proposed research center by 20 percent.</p>
        <p>New York Presbyterian Hospital is ''very concerned'' about the impact of the rezoning proposal on a mixed-use project it is planning at 165th Street and Fort Washington Avenue, said Constance P. Hildesley, a vice president in the office of real estate affairs.</p>
        <p>The project is envisioned as a 35-  or 36-story tower with an ambulatory care center, staff housing, a hotel for visitors to the medical center, offices, stores and parking. But under the proposal, a 140-foot height limit would be imposed on the site, which is within an R8 zoning district. That would yield a building of 14 stories.</p>
        <p>The 140-foot height limit would also affect plans by Silvercup Studios to add a tower to its main building at 42-22 22nd Street in Long Island City, said Paul D. Selver of the law firm Battle Fowler, which represents the studio.</p>
        <p>And the 140-foot limit might create a ''significant hardship'' for the Muss Development Company, said Harvey W. Schultz, speaking on behalf of Muss. The company plans to develop a 13-acre site in Flushing, between College Point Boulevard and the Flushing River. Because the project is so close to La Guardia Airport, Mr. Schultz said, it is already limited by the Federal Aviation Administration to buildings no higher than 172 feet.</p>
        <p>After the hearing, Mr. Schultz said he was hopeful a solution could be found. And a spokeswoman for the commission, Jennifer Chait, said the issues raised by the New York Presbyterian and Silvercup cases would be taken up by city planners.</p>
