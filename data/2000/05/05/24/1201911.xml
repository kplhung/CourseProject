      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>IN 1993, when most people wouldn't have known a dot-com from kingdom come, David and Carol Cesaro opened their little French bistro, L'Ardoise. The world, or at least a small part of it, has changed since then. Scads of restaurants have opened and flamed out, fortunes have been made and squandered, and still L'Ardoise has plugged away on its rather unfashionable block of First Avenue on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Now, almost seven years later, the Cesaros have with little fanfare opened their second restaurant, Panache, in Greenwich Village. It is named after a French summer cocktail that is two-thirds beer, one-third lemonade. Panache, in the style of L'Ardoise, is an unpretentious place, with a wood floor, leather banquettes and brass lighting fixtures. With little flash, the food is the thing at Panache, and the chef, Thierry Andry, formerly of Le Gans, has put together a menu that is generally down to earth and well-anchored in bistro traditions.</p>

        <p>IN 1993, when most people wouldn't have known a dot-com from kingdom come, David and Carol Cesaro opened their little French bistro, L'Ardoise. The world, or at least a small part of it, has changed since then. Scads of restaurants have opened and flamed out, fortunes have been made and squandered, and still L'Ardoise has plugged away on its rather unfashionable block of First Avenue on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>Now, almost seven years later, the Cesaros have with little fanfare opened their second restaurant, Panache, in Greenwich Village. It is named after a French summer cocktail that is two-thirds beer, one-third lemonade. Panache, in the style of L'Ardoise, is an unpretentious place, with a wood floor, leather banquettes and brass lighting fixtures. With little flash, the food is the thing at Panache, and the chef, Thierry Andry, formerly of Le Gans, has put together a menu that is generally down to earth and well-anchored in bistro traditions.</p>
        <p>You might imagine from the cautious expansion and conservative style that Mr. Cesaro would be subdued, but in fact he is a character, a thin, long-haired man who bounces around the dining room with nervous energy, bursting forth with wisecracks and appearing at each table just as food is served to gush, ''Bon appetit!''</p>
        <p>From the first bite of good, fresh French bread, you get the sense that simple things matter at Panache. Appetizers do not have a dozen ingredients each, but they are nonetheless pretty and delicious, like fillets of herring ($7), smoked just enough to enhance their natural brininess, served with marinated potatoes. Fat slices of soft garlic sausage ($7.50) surround a mound of lentils bathed in a tangy vinaigrette, while potatoes lyonnaise ($8), flecked with smoky bacon and red wine vinegar, are piled into a wide column and crowned with the head of a portobello mushroom touched with truffle oil.</p>
        <p>I have no complaints about the frisee salad with lardons ($8.50), a bistro cliche but still delicious, or the little chevre crusted in hazelnuts, but I did find the chef's own pate to be dull, tasting more like a refrigerator than fresh.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cesaro's aim is to please all types, so main courses range from a satisfying roast chicken with pearl onions, mushrooms and mashed potatoes ($15) to foie gras glazed in Calvados ($27.50), which I didn't try. I loved Mr. Andry's cod duo ($16), pairing a nicely roasted fillet with a sumptuous brandade, southern France's puree of potatoes, salt cod, olive oil and milk, augmented with a roasted garlic sauce. Salmon ($17) is cooked perfectly and enlivened by a heady horseradish sauce, while sliced leg of lamb ($17), served simply and invitingly with flageolet beans, is richly flavorful. A special one evening, tender sliced veal with capers, lemon and white wine ($18.50), was superb.</p>
        <p>The one misstep came on the fanciest dish on the menu, sliced duck breast with a honey-rosemary glaze ($18.50) that was so sweet I might as well have stuck my spoon directly into the honey jar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cesaro's wine list is terribly dull, but he says he is simply ridding himself of stock left over by Orienta, the last occupant of the site. I hope he gets it over with quickly.</p>
        <p>I rarely pay attention to creme brulee ($5), but one night when our table ordered a round of desserts to share, all spoons zeroed in on it and finished it off in seconds, it was so good. Mango cake with passion fruit sauce ($6) is a decent second choice. Mr. Cesaro has added a breakfast menu, and one night I poached a dessert from it, a crepe glazed with lemon syrup that was simple and wonderful. Mr. Cesaro didn't mind.</p>
        <p>''You want breakfast at night?'' he said. ''Fine. Rack of lamb at 11 a.m.? Whatever you want.''</p>
