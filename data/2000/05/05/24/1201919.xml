        <p>After a splendidly confusing setup involving a Russian scientist, some kind of diabolical science experiment and one of those peel-off latex faces that have become a hallmark of the franchise, ''M:I-2,'' or  ''Mission: Impossible 2'' tracks down its hero, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), in mid-vacation, hanging by his fingertips on the edge of a spectacular rock formation somewhere in the American Southwest. The camera circles like a curious buzzard, swooping and soaring in a brilliant aerial minuet.</p>
        <p>It's a great moment of cinematic bravura, but it's soon interrupted by the approach of a helicopter that delivers, via rocket launcher, a pair of talking sunglasses. In the growly basso of Sir Anthony Hopkins, this remarkable eyewear informs Mr. Hunt of the terms and conditions of his next missions, and then signs off with a familiar tag line: This message will self-destruct in five seconds.</p>
        <p>The movie takes a bit longer. The exact moment of its implosion can be pinpointed with digital, satellite-guided, high-tech accuracy. It comes after the flamenco dancers, before the religious procession through the streets of Seville (the action having moved from Australia to Utah to Andalusia with dizzying speed), at the end of a hair-raising car chase along the switchbacks of a seaside mountain highway.</p>
        <p>The film-buff reference point -- one of a dissertation's worth scattered about like land mines -- is ''To Catch a Thief'' -- and the purpose of the chase is, naturally, job recruitment. Ethan must persuade a fetching jewel thief named Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton) to join him in his mission, and to do so he nearly runs her cute silver Audi off a cliff. He falls in love with her instead, and off the cliff, in not altogether unentertaining flames, goes ''M: I- 2.''</p>
        <p>The first of Mr. Cruise's attempts (he produced both films, with Paula Wagner) to revive the legendary gadget-loaded television series for the big screen was directed by Brian  De Palma four years ago. This time out the assignment went to John Woo, the celebrated Hong Kong action auteur who has, with ''Broken Arrow'' and especially ''Face/Off,'' become one of Hollywood's most imaginative purveyors of car-chase-and-fireball cinema.</p>
        <p>The difference in the two directors' styles may account for the weird discontinuity between the two ''Missions.'' Mr. De Palma composes fugues of paranoia, while Mr. Woo prefers to present grand operas of passion and betrayal. He's a first-class action director, maybe the greatest choreographer of mayhem since Sam Peckinpah, but he doesn't care much for suspense. And so, once the basic conflict is established, the story plods along, alternating between preposterous -- in a bad way -- speeches and even more preposterous -- but in a good way -- shootouts and slugfests.</p>
        <p>''Any search for a hero must begin with what a hero requires -- a villain.'' This piece of wisdom is imparted several times in the course of the movie in the service of a metaphor about the viruses and anti-viruses that Ethan and Nyah, with technical support from the world-weary Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and the excitable Billy Baird (John Polson), must prevent from falling into the wrong hands. These hands belong to one Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott), a renegade employee of whomever it is Ethan works for, who also happens to be Nyah's ex-boyfriend.</p>
        <p>Ethan's professional duties are thus suddenly fraught with emotional complication. He must send the woman he loves into the clutches of his nemesis. Before he does, though, he injects a transponder chip into her ankle so that he can track her every move in the seaside Australian hideaway that Sean shares with his right-hand meanie, a glowering South African named Hugh Stamp (played by Richard Roxburgh). Now that's love.</p>
        <p>The end of the cold war and the waning of Gary Oldman's interest in this kind of work have spelled hard times for movie bad guys. Mr. Scott flirts glumly with self-parody, glowering as if he has just swallowed a piece of rancid sushi and delivering his lines in a mock-burr that sounds like Groundskeeper Willie of ''The Simpsons'' played on a slow speed.</p>
        <p>The script -- by Robert Towne, who contributed to the first ''Mission'' and also, if it's not too depressing to mention in this context, wrote ''Chinatown'' -- gives him lines that call for camp rather than the dour conviction he tries for.</p>
        <p>''I've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies waiting in line,'' he barks at one point during one of his frequent explanations of his diabolical scheme. But world domination isn't what it used to be back when Auric Goldfinger tried to corner the global market in precious metals. ''I want stock!'' Sean thunders. ''Stock options, to be precise.'' To rule the world nowadays entails owning 51 percent of a hot biotech company. This is not a man you'd want to go against in a proxy fight.</p>
        <p>But the fearless Ethan Hunt, racing to save Nyah from a gruesome death (most likely from exposure, since she must brave the gale force winds so common in Australia in T-shirts that barely obscure her navel), takes on Sean with the help of a helicopter, a flock of helpful pigeons  and his ready supply of latex faces.</p>
        <p>The movie's last action sequence -- pigeons, motorcycles and good old-fashioned kicks in the jaw -- is a little piece of Hong Kong heaven. If Mr. Cruise peeled off his face and turned out to have been Chow Yun Fat all along, the picture might be saved. But the stagy emotionalism Mr. Woo specializes in is not ideally suited to his gifts, and Mr. Cruise, his jaw churning to indicate ambivalence and pain, mostly registers confusion and fatigue, soon amply shared by the audience.</p>
        <p>Somewhere a group of film scholars must be putting together a symposium on the semiotics of Tom Cruise's hair, and I'd like to conclude by offering my own modest contribution to the enterprise. Clipped, Mr. Cruise tends to play cocksure, driven professionals, as in ''Top Gun,'' ''The Firm'' and the first ''Mission: Impossible.'' In his shaggier moments -- ''Born on the Fourth of July,'' ''Magnolia'' -- he allows himself more room for feeling, and gets more award nominations. In ''MI-2'' his locks are long and lank, perhaps to make the brash, businesslike Ethan Hunt seem more human. But he just seems like an amateur -- or, like Mr. Woo, a poet sent to do a job that called for an engineer.</p>
        <p>''M:I-2'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its brief, perfunctory sexual interlude is the cause of endless, highly stylized brutality.</p>
        <p>M:I-2  Directed by John Woo; written by Robert Towne, based on a story by Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga and the television series created by Bruce Geller; director of photography, Jeffrey L. Kimball; edited by Christian Wagner and Steven Kemper; music by Hans Zimmer; production designer, Tom Sanders; produced by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 120 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.</p>
        <p>WITH: Tom Cruise (Ethan Hunt), Dougray Scott (Sean Ambrose), Thandie Newton (Nyah Hall), Richard Roxburgh (Hugh Stamp), John Polson (Billy Baird), Brendan Gleeson (McCloy), Rade Sherbedgia (Dr. Nekhorvich) and Ving Rhames (Luther Stickell).</p>
