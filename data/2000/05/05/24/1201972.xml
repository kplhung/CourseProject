        <p>Japan's official economic statistics have always been mistrusted. They became even more suspect recently when the government omitted an important piece of information on quarterly growth, apparently for the first time.</p>

        <p>Japan's official economic statistics have always been mistrusted. They became even more suspect recently when the government omitted an important piece of information on quarterly growth, apparently for the first time.</p>
        <p>That information, as it turned out, reflected startling weakness, suggesting that Japan's financial institutions were spending little or nothing on upgrading their businesses. Inclusion of the information would have pushed the gross domestic product for October-December 1999 quarter significantly lower than what had been announced.</p>
        <p>The conscious omission of the data has been acknowledged by the Economic Planning Agency, though it has not been reported by the Japanese press.</p>
        <p>Still, its omission has invigorated critics, in and out of government, who have long contended that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party manipulates economic data for political reasons, papering over harsh realities to create the impression that the economy is recovering from its prolonged malaise.</p>
        <p>''In Japan, everything, including economic statistics, is about politics,'' said Kunji Okue, an economist here with the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.</p>
        <p>And a high-ranking official in the nation's financial bureaucracy remarked: ''This is very bad for Japan. Things like this damage our credibility, which is already quite shaky internationally.''</p>
        <p>Criticism of the data omission came at a particularly awkward time for the government of Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who is calling elections in a month.</p>
        <p>The ruling party has been relying on at least three powerful weapons heading into the elections: a strong stock market; a swell of sympathy voting related to the stroke and death of Mr. Mori's predecessor, Keizo Obuchi; and evidence that the government had firm control of a strengthening economy.</p>
        <p>But the stock market, as measured by the benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues, has slumped to its lowest levels in a year.</p>
        <p>Any sympathy generated by Mr. Obuchi's death seems to have evaporated, in part because of comments by Prime Minister Mori last week that evoked Japan's aggressively nationalistic past.</p>
        <p>According to a poll released today by a leading daily, Yomiuri Shimbun, the Mori cabinet's approval rating dropped 14 percentage points, to 27.9 percent, after Mr. Mori described Japan as ''a divine country with the emperor at its center.''</p>
        <p>The Economic Planning Agency had first reported on March 13 that the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the economy's performance, had declined 1.4 percent in the October-December quarter compared with the period a year earlier. In its first revision of the data on May 11, the agency said the decline was 1.43 percent.</p>
        <p>But the revised calculation excluded a piece of data from a survey on business investment that has, for as long as anyone here can remember, been included -- the rate of increase or decrease in capital investment by Japan's financial institutions.</p>
        <p>Had that piece of information been included, the revised gross domestic product would have fallen by an additional two-tenths or three-tenths of a percentage point, said Tadashi Nakamae, who heads his own economic research firm here.</p>
        <p>A lower figure would probably have made it harder for the government to achieve its 0.6 percent growth objective for the full fiscal year, which ended on March 31. That, in turn, might have hurt the Liberal Democrats in the elections next month. ''The difference using the data would have made is not so big,'' Mr. Nakamae said, ''but at the same time not so small when we're talking about an economic growth target of 0.6 percent.''</p>
        <p>Officials at the Economic Planning Agency maintain that politics played no role in their decision to omit the data they had collected on capital investment by financial institutions. Their standard procedure had been to replace the estimate used to calculate the preliminary gross domestic product with the actual data.</p>
        <p>''There has been no such political consideration in this process, because sooner or later it would be found out that that kind of consideration was made,'' said Masaaki Maruyama, head of the agency's national expenditures division. ''I think we just did our job coolly and objectively.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Maruyama's willingness to talk about the matter at all -- Economic Planning Agency officials are usually reticent to discuss their forecasts and methods -- lends some credibility to his denial of political maneuvering. The agency has pledged to shore up its professionalism and to take steps to improve both the quality and the collection methods for its data. For example, it now surveys taxi drivers, hairdressers and the like to rectify deficiencies in its information on consumption.</p>
        <p>''I hesitate to think that the agency is fudging the numbers,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, senior economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter here. ''There have been worries about this in the past, but the negative G.D.P. figure at the end of last year reinstated confidence in the honesty of the agency's statistical function.''</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Feldman said he was puzzled by the agency's decision to abandon procedures for making revisions in the gross domestic product figures. ''I am not sure what to make of this story,'' he said. ''It certainly has one message -- that the G.D.P. calculation methods need a lot of work.''</p>
        <p>In computing the initial figure for October-December 1999, the agency estimated that capital investment by banks, securities firms and insurance companies declined 3 percent, Mr. Maruyama said.</p>
        <p>But the agency's subsequent survey showed that capital investment by financial institutions fell by an extraordinary 37.7 percent. ''The discrepancy between our estimate and the survey this time was huge,'' Mr. Maruyama acknowledged.</p>
        <p>So he made a decision, which he said his superiors approved, to omit the survey figure from the revision and keep the earlier estimate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maruyama said the agency had never before substituted its estimates for the survey data. ''We hesitated to apply the survey figure because the discrepancy was so big and we had no explanation for it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He said another large discrepancy in the same measure appeared in the April-June 1997 quarter, when the agency's follow-up survey of financial institutions' capital spending showed a 29.4 percent drop from its original estimate. At that time, agency officials decided that the discrepancy reflected the effect of an increase in Japan's consumption tax, and they used the survey data in making the revision.</p>
        <p>This time, there was no such obvious explanation. ''We could not figure out if it was a problem with the survey data, or whether the survey reflected reality,'' Mr. Maruyama said.</p>
        <p>Under standard procedures, the Economic Planning Agency has two more opportunities to change its figures, in December and again next year. If the survey data are indeed flawed, the agency could conceivably adjust for that then.</p>
        <p>There is evidence, however, that the figures are not necessarily flawed. The Japanese central bank's quarterly survey of capital investment by 191 financial institutions showed that spending by these institutions fell 18.1 percent in 1999, and bank analysts are complaining that the companies they follow are not investing nearly enough in information technology to keep pace with global competitors.</p>
        <p>''One is left wondering what happened to all those grand plans for picking up technology investment,'' James P. Fiorillo, senior analyst at ING Barings, wrote in a recent report.</p>
