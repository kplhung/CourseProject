        <p>It lacked details and raised, but failed to answer, tantalizing questions. But Gov. George W. Bush's call today for ''a new approach'' to the nation's nuclear arsenal represented what could be, in the view of experts, a significant shift in arms control and post-cold-war relations with Russia.</p>
        <p>In his remarks at the National Press Club, Mr. Bush embraced concepts that arms controllers have long advocated, including deeper reductions in warheads and steps to ease the highest levels of alert at which those weapons can be launched on a moment's notice.</p>
        <p>He even left open the possibility of dramatic, unilateral steps, evoking his father's decision in 1991 to remove American bombers from alert and withdraw short-range nuclear weapons from Europe and Asia, a move quickly matched by the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</p>
        <p>But in calling for missile defenses not only for the United States but also for its allies, Mr. Bush challenged the longtime orthodoxy of arms control: that prohibiting defenses allowed limits in offenses.</p>
        <p>That assumption, embodied in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, stipulated that the ability of either side to destroy the other -- mutually assured destruction -- created a safer world by making the temptation to use nuclear weapons simply too risky to consider.</p>
        <p>''Our mutual security need no longer depend on a nuclear balance of terror,'' Mr. Bush declared, surrounded by members of Republican administrations who once defended some of the very assumptions that he challenged today.</p>
        <p>Many of the proposals outlined by Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, were greeted with striking praise from arms-control experts. In particular, they welcomed his pledge to ask the Pentagon to review its targeting strategies and rethink the number of warheads, which Mr. Bush called ''expensive relics of dead conflicts.''</p>
        <p>But they warned about the risks in other parts of Mr. Bush's vision. Mr. Bush's seemingly open-ended view of missile defenses, they said, could undercut the benefits of his proposals to reduce the number of weapons and take ''as many weapons as possible'' off ''hair-trigger status.''</p>
        <p>''It's very encouraging from the prospect of unilateral reductions,'' said George R. Perkovich, director of the W. Alton Jones Foundation, a private organization in Charlottesville, Va. ''But I don't think that kind of gesture is going to change any of the problems with our relationship with Russia. Even if we're willing to get to lower levels, the Russians aren't, because of the kind of national missile defense he's proposing.''</p>
        <p>Bruce G. Blair, president of the Center for Defense Information here and a strong advocate for reducing the alert status of American and Russian forces, welcomed Mr. Bush's remarks. But he said they contained inherent contradictions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair said that if the United States proceeded with a significant missile defense system, Russia would feel compelled to keep its forces on alert to preserve their ability to launch an overwhelming counterattack. A heightened Russian posture, he added, would convince the Pentagon that the steps Mr. Bush said he would pursue -- even unilaterally -- would not be possible.</p>
        <p>''They're working at cross-purposes,'' Mr. Blair said.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Bush nor his aides would discuss his proposals in detail, leaving many questions about how -- and whether -- he could bring about a new era of arms control in a Bush presidency. He did not rule out creating a missile defense based at sea or in space, which would prove even more unsettling to the Russians than the limited system the Clinton administration is considering and would certainly require abrogation of the A.B.M. treaty.</p>
        <p>And while he said he favored reducing arsenals below the 3,000 to 3,500 warheads negotiated under the second strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start II, he did not say whether he would go as low as the proposed Start III levels of 2,000 or 2,500.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush emphasized that he would never make any reductions that the Pentagon did not endorse, but it has long been the Pentagon that has resisted deeper reductions in warheads.</p>
        <p>Today, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, along with Adm. Richard W. Mies, the commander of the strategic force, appeared before the Senate's Armed Services Committee and testified that they would oppose any further reductions in warheads beyond Start III, something that Russia has proposed.</p>
        <p>''There is a cushion in larger numbers,'' Admiral Mies said. ''And there is a tyranny in smaller numbers that reduces stability in certain situations.''</p>
        <p>Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a research group here, said it was possible to move past the ''cold-war logic'' of mutually assured destruction and allow for a defensive system. The key, he said, was to manage a ''cooperative transition'' with the Russians that would reassure them that they would not lose their strategic leverage when the United States builds a defensive shield.</p>
        <p>''What George W. did not tell us was the kind of defenses and the architecture he is envisioning,'' Mr. Krepon said. ''Those particulars will clarify whether or not this cooperative transition is likely to succeed.''</p>
