        <p>Facing the overpowering Trevor Hoffman in the top of the 10th inning at Qualcomm Stadium today, the Mets sent up Jay Payton, Rey Ordonez and Mark Johnson.</p>
        <p>Payton worked a full count against Hoffman, the San Diego Padres' closer, but flied out, prolonging an awful slump. Ordonez, who has been unable to maintain a .200 average for two games in a row this year, struck out on Hoffman's devastating changeup.</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine then called for Johnson as a pinch-hitter -- he offered no explanation -- and Johnson was grateful for the chance. Johnson had flied out off Hoffman to end Monday's loss, and he learned from that at-bat to stay back and wait on the changeup. Johnson did, and he blooped it into center field for his first hit this year -- and the first for the Mets since the fourth inning.</p>
        <p>The Mets had a baserunner, and Johnson said he knew what that would mean: Mike Piazza would bat. Piazza had been given a rare day off, and he did not think he would be used after the Mets had built a three-run lead for Al Leiter. But the Padres had tied the score, and when Johnson reached base, Joe McEwing returned to the dugout.</p>
        <p>Piazza grabbed a bat to face a pitcher he has crushed. And he delivered again, lining a homer to right and lifting the Mets to a 5-3 victory over the Padres.</p>
        <p>''He sits and takes the whole day off, and we're out there working for nine innings,'' said a smiling Todd Zeile, who homered and doubled before Piazza's heroics. ''Then he comes up and takes a half-swing and ends up the player of the game. It's really kind of annoying, but we're glad to have him. We're glad he's annoying us instead of somebody else.''</p>
        <p>Zeile should count Hoffman among the annoyed. The homer was Piazza's fourth in 12 career at-bats against Hoffman, the latest top pitcher to lose a duel with him. Piazza's last two homers before today came off Arizona's top two starters, Randy Johnson and Todd Stottlemyre.</p>
        <p>''He has had a way of rising to the occasion against the best pitchers,'' Valentine said. ''Mike's as good a hitter as there is in the game.''</p>
        <p>Piazza, who is 5 for 12 with 11 runs batted in off Hoffman, said he has learned from the times Hoffman has gotten him out. But Hoffman tried something different against Piazza this time -- a cut fastball, 86 miles an hour, down and away -- and it still did not work.</p>
        <p>''We keep going back to the drawing board trying to find ways to get him out,'' Hoffman said. ''We'll just have to go back again.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' closer, Armando Benitez, had better luck against the Padres' best-known hitter. With a man on second and two outs, Benitez got Tony Gwynn to fly to left for the final out and his 12th save. The victory made the Mets 9-0 in games started by Leiter, who worked seven strong innings and was relieved by Turk Wendell (4-2), who earned the victory. But Leiter did not win the game, despite the lead he had gotten off homers by Zeile and Todd Pratt and a run-scoring single by Edgardo Alfonzo. Gwynn, a familiar nemesis of Leiter's, made sure of that.</p>
        <p>Gwynn, who will one day be the first player wearing a Padres cap elected to Cooperstown, has had a rough early season. Leiter hit him with a pitch on April 3 at Shea Stadium, and he missed three games. A few days after he returned, he was sidelined by a knee injury, which forced him to the disabled list.</p>
        <p>Gwynn had no hits at home until today, but he was facing one of his favorite pitchers in Leiter. Gwynn stroked a run-scoring double in the fourth and scored on a bloop double by Ed Sprague to narrow the deficit to 3-2. In the sixth, Gwynn tied the game with a solo home run.</p>
        <p>It was his 3,082nd hit, moving him past Cap Anson and into 17th place on the career list. Leiter has surrendered 10 of those hits, in 22 at-bats by Gwynn.</p>
        <p>He faced six more batters after Gwynn's homer, retiring all of them. But the victory that has become automatic in Leiter's games was not secured for a few more innings, until Piazza had a chance to swing.</p>
        <p>''Any time you face San Diego, you know Tony's going to get at least one hit every time,'' Leiter said. ''Tony ruined my day, but Mike certainly turned it around.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Although several major league officials toured the Rawlings plant in Costa Rica on Monday and found nothing unusual in the manufacturing of baseballs, Mets reliever TURK WENDELL is skeptical. Wendell believes there is something different with the ball this year, and he had X-rays taken of a 1999 ball and a 2000 ball to measure their density. This year's baseballs are more dense, Wendell said, reasoning that they can travel farther because of it. Wendell has also cut baseballs open and said the cork center on a 2000 ball resembles a superball. ''In the past, you could fool a guy and give up a homer,'' Wendell said, ''but not to the extent it is now.'' Wendell said he had no plans to share his findings with major league officials because he doubts they would admit it if something was different with the ball. . . . JAY PAYTON, who entered the game as a defensive replacement, is one for his last 31. . . . TODD PRATT, making just his second start for MIKE PIAZZA since May 3, has hit .357 in his 11 starts. He made a sliding catch in foul territory to retire ED SPRAGUE for the first out in the Padres' ninth. . . . STAN SPENCER, a Padres right-hander who abandoned the popular slide-step delivery because it was straining his shoulder, allowed 10 steals to Florida in his last start, but won. . . .  The The Mets' JOE McEWING reached base on an error to open the game, then stole second and scored when he was running on a hard single to left. EDGARDO ALFONZO, however, was thrown out when the Padres pitched out, and the Mets had only two more baserunners off Spencer and attempted no more steals.</p>
