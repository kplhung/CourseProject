        <p>When Gov. John G. Rowland signed an executive order last week directing Connecticut power plants to cut smokestack emissions, the political spin cycle began almost immediately.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland, a Republican, said his order accomplished what the Democratic-led Legislature failed to do through a bill that died earlier this month. Democrats and environmental groups denounced the order as a valentine to the power industry.</p>
        <p>Neither side seems to have got it quite right.</p>
        <p>Unlike the failed bill, Mr. Rowland's order will cut pollution without specifically singling out six fossil-fuel power plants that emitted more than a million pounds of toxic chemicals in 1998. And though Mr. Rowland said his order was ''as good as it gets'' for cleaner air in Connecticut, what his directive will accomplish is not yet clear. Indeed, its precise effects will remain unknown until this summer, when state environmental officials use it to write specific new regulations.</p>
        <p>Environmental groups condemned Mr. Rowland's order as ''an empty gesture,'' though state environmental officials said it would cut emissions of nitrogen oxide and the more toxic sulfur dioxide by an estimated minimum of 17,000 tons a year.</p>
        <p>Some environmentalists also criticized the order -- apparently inaccurately -- for not setting a deadline for the six power plants, all built before 1977, to cut their emissions. But Michelle Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said the order would force polluters to cut emissions of sulfur dioxide by 30 to 50 percent, and to cut nitrogen oxide by 20 to 30 percent, within three years.</p>
        <p>The Toxics Action Center, which lobbied heavily for the emissions bill that later failed, criticized Mr. Rowland's order for allowing Connecticut power plants that emit less than their legal limit to sell the remaining ''emissions credits'' -- pollution rights -- to plants in other parts of the country. Doing so, the group said, will not cut pollution levels around the highest-polluting power generators, where poor air quality has been linked by some studies to increased levels of asthma and other illnesses.</p>
        <p>Federal and state environmental officials conceded that the order would allow interstate trading of emissions credits, but said the practice would still help improve air quality throughout the state.</p>
        <p>''The way you have to look at it is like being in a pond,'' said Steven Rapp, the air permits manager in the  Environmental Protection Agency's office in Boston. ''If you dump a lot of junk in the pond, it sloshes around the whole pond. If you stop allowing people to dump in the pond, it helps the whole pond.''</p>
        <p>This month, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and commissioned by the Clean Air Task Force found that people living within 30 miles of two antiquated Massachusetts power plants faced significant health risks.</p>
        <p>Citing the study, Bernadette Del Chiaro, a director with the Toxics Action Center in Connecticut, said Mr. Rowland's order would do little for Connecticut residents.</p>
        <p>She also pointed out that New York's governor, George E. Pataki, is considering signing a bill that would penalize any utility that sells emissions credits to power plants in 10 Midwestern and Southern states.</p>
        <p>Air quality in Connecticut fails to meet federal clean-air standards mostly because of ground-level ozone. But the sulfur dioxide emitted by power plants adds to the problem, in part because of geography: Northeastern states receive windblown pollution from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Aside from the environmental issues, Mr. Rowland's executive order seemed politically hypocritical to Democratic lawmakers.</p>
        <p>''The governor engaged in an active lobbying campaign to kill'' the bill in the Legislature, said Roy Occhiogrosso, spokesman for Kevin B. Sullivan, the Democratic Senate president pro tem.</p>
        <p>Democratic lawmakers say they will form a working group over the summer to oversee the carrying out of the new regulations. Next year, they say, they will write legislation aimed at the state's six older power plants. ''The executive order will be made irrelevant by better legislation,'' Mr. Occhiogrosso said.</p>
