        <p>In this land of legends and myths, it is a tale that tells some truth. Soon after Hernan  Cortes conquered the Aztecs, one of his slaves -- Juan Garrido by name -- found three tiny wheat seeds at the bottom of a bag of rice from Europe. In 1522 he planted them in a field not far from here. One took hold and produced a stalk of wheat with 180 seeds -- the first wheat harvested in the New World.</p>
        <p>Whether it was Juan Garrido or someone else who introduced wheat to the Americas, the fertile fields of central Mexico have been the epicenter of the global exchange of genetic plant material for 500 years. Such crossbreeding has resulted in bigger and more hearty wheat and corn, which helps all people, but none more so than the poor.</p>
        <p>For more than 40 years, plant breeders from around the world have freely used genetic material from one of the world's great collections of wheat seeds -- 150,000 varieties stored in a concrete bunker here built to last 100 years. A twin repository holds 20,000 kinds of corn, sometimes called maize. Wheat and corn are the world's most important food crops, and researchers use basic crossbreeding techniques to improve them, developing, for example, wheat better suited to drought in Africa, or corn more resistant to Latin American insects.</p>
        <p>Now, what some see as a new threat that could be far more dangerous than any pest has emerged. Private companies and universities are busy patenting plant genes and claiming intellectual property rights to biotechnology advances. Suddenly, the free exchange of plant resources is in question as discoveries representing millions of dollars in profits are patented, potentially keeping poor farmers from using them.</p>
        <p>The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, the nonprofit agency that runs the corn and wheat banks here, surprised some supporters by putting into place this month its own policy to patent work that was traditionally made available to everyone.</p>
        <p>The center has been a leader in the so-called Green Revolution, and its breakthroughs have been applied in roughly two-thirds of the wheat and half of all the improved corn grown in poor countries. Directors say the policy change was a defensive tactic to block attempts to patent the center's discoveries and thus keep small farmers from using them.</p>
        <p>Although the center's focus remains helping the poor, not making money, the move has dismayed some supporters. ''To us it's a slippery slope,'' said Pat Roy Mooney, executive director of the Rural Advancement Foundation International, a conservation organization in Winnipeg that focuses on agricultural issues. ''Once patents or profits become motivation for their work, they'll find it very hard to sort out what their research priorities are going to be.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mooney worries that the center is overly eager to work with big biotechnology companies like Monsanto and Novartis. Those companies have progressed rapidly in biotechnology, genetically modifying tomatoes to make them last longer and creating soybeans resistant to a herbicide. But such advances benefit developed countries, not the poor.</p>
        <p>Biotechnology for poor countries is done at centers like the one here. In some instances, the big private companies have shared genes with the center's researchers. But since the center makes its work available to all, the big companies sometimes hold back, worried that secrets might slip into competitors' hands.</p>
        <p>Timothy G. Reeves, the center's director general, said most foreign countries that finance its projects now demand patents. He also said patents may actually ensure the availability of new varieties by preventing private companies that use the center's genetic material from patenting it along with their own developments.</p>
        <p>But the bottom line of the new policy is an acknowledgment that the center, with a yearly budget of $34 million, needs to work with private companies, each of which spends hundreds of millions on research. To do so, Professor Reeves said, the center must recognize that patents have become unavoidable.</p>
        <p>''We felt it was important to let our partners know that we want to look out for their interests,'' said Professor Reeves, an Australian agronomist who keeps stalks of wheat and ears of corn on the coffee table in his office. ''If, on a case-by-case basis, we feel that the best way to keep our products available for the benefit of the poor is to take some intellectual property protection, then we'll do it.''</p>
        <p>In at least one instance, the center has already taken out a patent and is collaborating with several companies, including a French seed company, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, and Novartis, the multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company. Together they are trying to cross breed the asexual reproductive gene of a wild grass with corn, creating a hearty new type of corn that, unlike other hybrids, can reproduce itself.</p>
        <p>The center gets access to the technology, and a commitment from the private companies to protect the patent. For Novartis and Pioneer, the plant's ability to produce an exact replica of itself significantly speeds up breeding, since it is far less haphazard than combining two parent plants.</p>
        <p>Once the right type is developed, it can be distributed to poor countries. The company can eliminate the reproductive gene for commercial sales in developed countries.</p>
        <p>That is the kind of collaboration Professor Reeves is seeking.</p>
        <p>''Unless we can use the best technologies, whatever they are, we're just not going to be able to do the job that our partners are expecting of us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Researchers and plant breeders at the center who are devoted to using biotechnology for the poor have accepted the new policy, though reluctantly.</p>
        <p>''Patenting individual genes is like copyrighting each and every word in Hamlet, and saying no one can use any word used in Hamlet without paying the author,'' said Dr. Bent Skovmand, a Danish researcher who oversees the center's wheat bank. Still, he sees no alternative. ''I'm very much against the patenting of life forms,'' he said, ''but I'm afraid it is something we cannot avoid.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Skovmand literally travels to the end of the earth to collect rare wheat specimens. Over the years, he has brought back collections from countries ranging from Turkey to Tibet, and next month he will wander the Guatemalan highlands looking for wheat types that date back to Juan Garrido's garden.</p>
        <p>He carefully catalogs each type in the bank, noting desirable characteristics and flagging weaknesses. All the information is now on a CD.</p>
        <p>That, in essence, is his intellectual property, but he says he would never consider patenting the data. ''When it first came out,'' he said, handing a free copy to a visitor, ''my idea was to put on the back of each one: 'Duplication of this CD is enthusiastically encouraged.' ''</p>
        <p>Although it did not happen, it would make a great legend.</p>
