        <p>Carl Everett begins the discussion by claiming that he does not speak to New York reporters, then turns to a befuddled Red Sox teammate for confirmation that it has been three years since he did an interview with anyone from New York. When Everett is reminded of an article in a New York newspaper two months ago, the new villain for Yankees fans insists that he must have been quoted from a group interview.</p>
        <p>As Everett declines to be interviewed, he talks about his reasoning. It is not totally clear if Everett is serious about being silent, but he seems rather serious. Finally, Mike Stanley, a former Yankee, is asked to mediate and he assures Everett that he will be quoted accurately. Seconds later, the verbal faucet is on and Everett agrees to answer questions.</p>
        <p>Everett explains why he despises the Yankees, who drafted him in the first round in 1990. He explains why the disparaging remarks he made about Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill this spring were misinterpreted, but he still sounds critical of them. He blames ignorance for the allegations of child abuse levied against Everett and his wife while he played for the Mets in 1997. He scoffs at the notion that he will be berated when the Red Sox visit Yankee Stadium on Friday.</p>
        <p>''I don't care about that,'' Everett said earlier this month. ''People can say and do whatever they want. But just don't put your hands on me. That's all. Don't do that.''</p>
        <p>Don't touch Everett. Don't ask Everett about his five children. Don't try to convince Everett that the Yankees have won three of the last four World Series in part because they have developed enormous talent in minor league system. That will not sit well with Everett, who was acquired from the salary-dumping Astros and has helped turn an already dangerous team into even more of a contender to dethrone the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Pedro Martinez is the king of the hill and Nomar Garciaparra is the king of the lineup, but Everett has made it three kings on the first-place Red Sox, who have a one-game lead on the Yankees. That is an accomplishment. Everett has arguably been the most important acquisition of the off-season in baseball and, with a .338 average, 13 homers and 37 runs batted in, he already has more home runs than Red Sox center fielders had all of last season.</p>
        <p>Everett deserves attention for what he does on the field and, sometimes, for what he says off it, too. He is the perfect fit for the Red Sox, and he has endeared himself to fans with his hits, his hustle and his hatred of things New York. The rivalry between the Yankees and the Red Sox never needs spicing, but Everett might hate the Yankees more than fans who have endured dreary Octobers for decades.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people wonder why I dislike the Yankees,'' he said. ''There were people there who didn't want to help you. There were people who didn't want me to succeed in the minor leagues. They worked for the organization when I was there. They were envious people.''</p>
        <p>Everett did not specify to whom he was referring, and Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president for baseball operations who was a minor league coordinator then, did not return a message. But Everett, who turns 29 next month, said he never wanted to be drafted by the Yankees out of Hillsborough High School in Tampa, Fla. Since Everett never rose above Class A in three years with the Yankees, he was happy to be selected by Florida in the expansion draft in 1992.</p>
        <p>''Everyone knew if you came up in their farm system, it was slim or none that you were going to make it,'' he said. ''I wanted to go somewhere else and show what I could do. It didn't matter what I did in the Yankee system, it wasn't going to happen.''</p>
        <p>When Everett was reminded that the Yankees have excelled because of home-grown players like Jeter, Bernie Williams, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte, Ramiro Mendoza and Jorge Posada, he shook his head. Instead, Everett mentioned how it took Shane Spencer nine years to get to the majors and how Ricky Ledee is ''as good a hitter as anyone'' and cannot get established. Everett's arguments were flimsy, but his grudge wassolid.</p>
        <p>''If you weren't there,'' he said, ''you might not understand how I look at it.''</p>
        <p>Understanding Everett can be a challenge. Less than a month into spring training this year, Everett said the Yankees win even though they do not have superstars. When a reporter asked about Jeter, Everett said Jeter is not a superstar because he does not change games in an instant. Everett listed Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr. as superstars.</p>
        <p>''If people want to misinterpret me saying he's not a superstar, go ahead,'' Everett said. ''He's a great player, a good player. But, if I'm a pitcher, I'm not worried about him hitting a three-run homer or changing the outcome of a game.''</p>
        <p>Jeter handled Everett's barbs with aplomb, saying: ''Everyone is entitled to his opinion. But what about the stuff he said about O'Neill?''</p>
        <p>Everett ran his finger across his throat in a slicing motion in March as his way of saying the 37-year-old O'Neill was done. But Everett tried to recant his criticism of O'Neill, too.</p>
        <p>''I said when a guy is getting at the end of his career, he has to work harder to get where he wants,'' he said. ''That was left out and it looked like I was dogging O'Neill.''</p>
        <p>O'Neill chuckled over the criticism and said he cared only about what Manager Joe Torre said about him. Still, O'Neill, a proud player who has become more age sensitive, might have been playing coy, too. ''Everett is having a great year for them,'' he added. ''Isn't he?''</p>
        <p>He is. Everett is immersed in Boston and is happy he signed a three-year, $21 million contract extension. He usually stops outside the players' entrance at Fenway Park and signs autographs. Four other Red Sox players breezed by without signing autographs earlier this month, but Everett signed and posed for pictures for 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>''Every place I've played, Boston outweighs them in terms of fan support,'' he said. ''They're into every game. They're more down than we are when we lose.''</p>
        <p>As chatty as Everett eventually was, he was brief when asked about having allegations of child abuse brought against him and his wife, Linda, in 1997. A child-care worker at Shea Stadium noticed bruises on one of Everett's children, Shawna, who was 5, and she and Carl, who was 4, were placed in city custody while Everett and his wife went to Queens Family Court.</p>
        <p>The judge ruled that Linda, Shawna's stepmother, used ''excessive corporal punishment'' and that Carl failed to take ''appropriate action.'' The couple had to attend parenting classes and undergo mental health evaluations before their son was returned to them, but Shawna was ordered to live with a grandmother. Everett blames that serious situation on New York, too.</p>
        <p>''Some people do things to hurt others and they don't care,'' he said. ''Even if they were wrong, they say, 'Oh well.' That was the case with me in New York. That's what people did to me. I had to deal with all of that garbage when I was in New York.''</p>
        <p>Everett visits again this weekend, but only because he must.</p>
