        <p>In the crush at the gray steel gates leading into Israel here today, Abdullah Abu Samra, a 24-year veteran of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, fumbled with a suitcase, stuffing it with clothes he pulled from a large plastic bag.</p>
        <p>In a matter of hours, Mr. Abu Samra, 43, a father of six and the owner of three stores and a house in the village of Kleia, had been reduced from militiaman to refugee, forced to leave virtually everything behind.</p>
        <p>Then, on the orders of Israeli officers, he moved forward on foot, leaving his car in a long line of vehicles abandoned by militia members and their families as they fled to Israel.</p>
        <p>''We're going to the unknown,'' he said as he inched ahead with his daughters. ''We don't know what's next, and there's no going back. We're like birds in the air.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Abu Samra was one of more than 3,000 militia members and their relatives who fled to Israel overnight and today ahead of a complete Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. They massed at border checkpoints to escape what they feared could be prison or even death at the hands of Hezbollah guerrillas who were overrunning their villages and abandoned outposts in southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>At Fatima Gate, outside the Israeli border town of Metulla, hundreds of men, women and children, carrying suitcases, backpacks and plastic bags stuffed with hastily packed belongings, waited for hours in their cars, then surged on foot toward the gates in a desperate attempt to reach safety in Israel.</p>
        <p>Some women wept for relatives left behind, small children cried in the beating sun, and men argued with Israeli officers who let in a slow but constant trickle of people, assuring those massing at the gate that they would all be allowed to enter.</p>
        <p>Anxiety was heightened when shots rang out near the crossing and a triumphant cry echoed across the valley from a loudspeaker in Kafr Kila, another village that had fallen to Hezbollah, or the Party of God. Some villagers later tried to loot cars abandoned by the militiamen, carrying off weapons left in the vehicles before Israeli soldiers opened fire and sent them fleeing.</p>
        <p>''Protect us,'' pleaded one distraught woman with an Israeli officer as thumps of artillery fire echoed from the hills. ''We've left our homes, and now we have nothing. I came here with only the clothes on my back.''</p>
        <p>The woman, married to a militiaman, had worked 16 years in Israel, crossing regularly with thousands of other relatives of militia members through the checkpoint, which the Israelis had dubbed the Good Fence.</p>
        <p>Today all that came to an end as members of the South Lebanon Army fled to Israel, surrendered or defected to Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>Among many of those escaping, there was a deep sense of betrayal by Israel.</p>
        <p>''For 25 years we worked together and we shed our blood together, and this is the respect we get in the end,'' said Daher Rafael, 37, a former militiaman who in recent years worked as a contractor, building outposts for the Israelis and the militia. ''The Israelis did what was right for them, and we got the raw end of the deal.''</p>
        <p>A women waiting in line in her car spat out, ''Lebanon and Israel are both dogs, and we're stuck in the middle.''</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, Israeli government ministers and top army officers promised to provide for the militia members and receive them with open arms. But their words provided little solace for Samer Aloush, 25, a militiaman from the village of Yarin who found himself today in an Israeli processing center for the refugees at a resort village by the Sea of Galilee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aloush, who left behind a 3-year-old daughter with his mother, said he had made a mistake by allying himself with the Israelis. ''They promised us 100 percent support, they said they wouldn't leave us until United Nations troops took over our positions, but the opposite happened and they just put us on buses and brought us here,'' he said. Mr. Aloush said he had no intention of settling in Israel, and preferred to go abroad.</p>
        <p>''We're not traitors, we were defending our land,'' he asserted, echoing arguments by militia members that their role during more than two decades was to defend their villages against armed Palestinian and Shiite Muslim groups. But the Lebanese government has condemned the militiamen as traitors, trying many in absentia.</p>
        <p>Shaalan Mustafa, a militiaman from Beit Lif, said he escaped on Monday night when guerrillas closed in on his village after he and his colleagues had surrendered their arms. He left behind his wife and six children.</p>
        <p>''Israel has sold us out more than Hezbollah,'' he said. ''When were were fighting the terrorists, I knew that Israel would stand by me. Today I saw that there was no power behind me, and that Israel doesn't care anymore what happens. They've thrown us to the wolves. We've reached a dead end.''</p>
        <p>But not all those who fled to Israel today expressed sorrow about leaving home. Samir Abdullah, 30, a member of the militia's intelligence service, said he was well rid of life in war-ravaged southern Lebanon. ''That country's not ours,'' he said. ''It's a mess.''</p>
