        <p>Wearing a New Hat</p>
        <p>It was a bit like a coming-out party. On Thursday, the day after HAROLD O. LEVY was formally pronounced chancellor of New York City schools, the City University of New York held a reception for him at the Lotos Club. The timing was fortuitous; the event had been planned two months earlier. The reception drew about 150 people, including seven state regents, CUNY trustees and  MATTHEW GOLDSTEIN, CUNY's chancellor.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein and Mr. Levy were introduced to each other last fall. At the time, Mr. Levy was a regent and Dr. Goldstein was seeking his vote for CUNY's hotly debated remedial policy, which bars students who cannot pass placement tests from its bachelor's degree programs. (Mr. Levy voted for the policy.) Now, they are like blood brothers.</p>

        <p>Wearing a New Hat</p>
        <p>It was a bit like a coming-out party. On Thursday, the day after HAROLD O. LEVY was formally pronounced chancellor of New York City schools, the City University of New York held a reception for him at the Lotos Club. The timing was fortuitous; the event had been planned two months earlier. The reception drew about 150 people, including seven state regents, CUNY trustees and  MATTHEW GOLDSTEIN, CUNY's chancellor.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein and Mr. Levy were introduced to each other last fall. At the time, Mr. Levy was a regent and Dr. Goldstein was seeking his vote for CUNY's hotly debated remedial policy, which bars students who cannot pass placement tests from its bachelor's degree programs. (Mr. Levy voted for the policy.) Now, they are like blood brothers.</p>
        <p>So at the party, they talked about their interconnectedness and exchanged caps. Mr. Levy gave Dr. Goldstein a khaki cap with his name on the back and a Board of Education logo on the front. Dr. Goldstein gave Mr. Levy a black cap with his name on the back and the CUNY logo on the front. Then, in honor of Mr. Levy's appointment -- and his affinity for poetry -- Dr. Goldstein read ''To Be of Use,'' a poem by Marge Piercy. One stanza, in particular, seemed to be a metaphor for the job of heading the city schools:</p>
        <p>I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,</p>
        <p>who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,</p>
        <p>who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,</p>
        <p>who do what has to be done, again and again.</p>
        <p>How to Feed a Caterpillar</p>
        <p>On Monday and Tuesday, the little caterpillar ate his way through one apple and two pears, but today, ERIC CARLE will take the techniques behind his children's classic ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' to Public School 84 in Queens. About 150 teachers are expected to participate in a workshop led by Mr. Carle, who is also the book's illustrator, with an additional 120 teachers from P.S. 149, also in Queens, participating via video conferencing. Mr. Carle's workshop is sponsored by Studio in a School, an organization that brings painters and sculptors to teach in schools.</p>
        <p>Help With Online Education  Columbia University and New York University are both turning to outside companies for help with developing and promoting their continuing-education programs online.</p>
        <p>Columbia said yesterday that it would work with Cognitive Arts, a company that designs technology for online education and corporate training, to offer courses in computer technology and English as a second language. It also plans to develop basic courses in economics and psychology. New York University recently announced that McGraw-Hill, the publishing company, would market and distribute some of the courses it offers through NYUonline, its for-profit digital venture. The courses will be aimed at corporate clients McGraw-Hill reaches through its Lifetime Learning division. GORDON MACOMBER, NYUonline's president and chief executive, said his group had about 100 hours of courses up and running, in areas like conflict management and communications skills for managers.</p>
        <p>A Tarantella on Livingston Street</p>
        <p>As the choreographer ELIOT FELD stage-whispered ''Good boy!'' and ''Ignore me!'' from his front-row folding chair, and classical music descended from the rafters, 23 young dancers from Ballet Tech's New York City Public School for Dance pirouetted their way across a portable linoleum floor last week at 110 Livingston Street. It was the start of Arts Monday, a program to showcase arts in city schools, and a good-size crowd turned out, attracted by the spectacle of toe shoes and leotards in the normally grim hall of the Board of Education. After performing Balanchine's ''Tarantella,'' EMANUEL ROBINSON, 15, confessed that he had no idea who the balding man leading the standing ovation might be. But when you have performed at Jacob's Pillow and the Kennedy Center, a New York City schools chancellor is just another curtain call.</p>
