        <p>Jon S. Corzine intensified his television campaign for the United States Senate today, letting loose a $2 million-a-week barrage of commercials that accuse former Gov. Jim Florio, his opponent in the Democratic primary, of lying about Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, meanwhile, made his harshest attack yet on Mr. Corzine,  saying his rival, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, stood to benefit personally if government money was put into the stock market to bolster Social Security.</p>
        <p>In addition, after 10 weeks and more than $12 million of unanswered Corzine commercials, the first Florio television advertisements will begin  Wednesday. They are expected to attack Mr. Corzine on Social Security, health care and his refusal to release his income tax returns, according to one person who said he had heard the advertisements.</p>
        <p>With two weeks remaining until the June 6 primary, the two Democrats are trying to appeal to elderly people, who the candidates expect will make up a third or more of the voters. Mr. Florio is trying to paint Mr. Corzine as a rapacious Wall Street titan more interested in lining his pockets than protecting the vulnerable recipients of Social Security.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Florio asserted that Goldman Sachs ''stands to make hundreds of millions of dollars at the expense of our retirees'' if Mr. Corzine's plan is adopted for a limited investment of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market.</p>
        <p>''He's advocating a change that is going to directly benefit his industry, his company and presumably himself,'' Mr. Florio said. ''I don't know what the motivation is. That's not the relevant issue.</p>
        <p>''The relevant issue is that this change that he's advocating is going to directly benefit, tangibly and substantially, the investment industry itself; and, inasmuch as Goldman Sachs is a substantial participant in the investment industry, Goldman Sachs. And, to the degree that Mr. Corzine is the single largest individual investor and holder of an interest in Goldman Sachs, to the tune of over four million shares, whatever conclusion you arrive at is not something that I think is particularly good from the standpoint of appearance.''</p>
        <p>Steven Goldstein, a Corzine spokesman, called the assertions ''preposterous beyond belief.''</p>
        <p>''What's so obscene about this charge,'' Mr. Goldstein said, ''is that one day Jim Florio accuses Jon Corzine of being too rich, and the next day, of supporting a public policy matter to line his own pockets.</p>
        <p>''Be real, Jim. You're the only person in the world who thinks that Jon Corzine would enter public service or propose any idea for pecuniary gain. If there's one thing everyone in politics agrees on, it's that Jon Corzine, with his resources, cannot be bought, or bossed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, for his part, is trying to take the issue of Social Security away from Mr. Florio, who has used it like a club. After spending $1.3 million a week on commercials, the Corzine campaign announced today  it had increased its spending by more than half for the final two weeks. It released three new commercials, two attacking Mr. Florio on Social Security.</p>
        <p>One, titled ''Misleading,'' accuses Mr. Florio of lying about his support for the stock-market investment idea that Mr. Corzine favors. Another,  ''Raid,'' accuses Mr. Florio of voting ''with Newt Gingrich against ending Ronald Reagan's raid on the Social Security trust funds'' in 1985, voting for cuts in Social Security in 1983, and voting ''to cut Social Security benefits for the disabled'' in 1979.</p>
        <p>''Isn't it time to keep politicians like Jim Florio away from Social Security?'' it concludes.</p>
        <p>Jim Lanard, a Florio spokesman, called the claims ludicrous. He said Mr. Florio's votes had been misrepresented.</p>
        <p>''The Corzine campaign has hit a new low,'' Mr. Lanard said. ''This is about as sleazy as it gets. Jim Florio has been the strongest supporter of Social Security that any member of Congress could be. This is a desperation attempt by Jon Corzine to deflect attention away from his most vulnerable position. The voters will not be tricked by this chicanery.''</p>
