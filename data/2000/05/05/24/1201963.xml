        <p>Shareholders of The New York Times Company authorized a new class of stock yesterday intended to track the value of New York Times Digital, the company's Internet business division.</p>
        <p>The proposal was approved by a majority of stockholders of both Class A and Class B shares, as required. It was backed by a 3-to-1 margin, with 103,317,788 Class A shares -- about 61 percent of the 169 million outstanding shares -- approving. A total of 27,308,321 shares were voted in opposition.</p>

        <p>Shareholders of The New York Times Company authorized a new class of stock yesterday intended to track the value of New York Times Digital, the company's Internet business division.</p>
        <p>The proposal was approved by a majority of stockholders of both Class A and Class B shares, as required. It was backed by a 3-to-1 margin, with 103,317,788 Class A shares -- about 61 percent of the 169 million outstanding shares -- approving. A total of 27,308,321 shares were voted in opposition.</p>
        <p>Among Class B shares -- which control the company and are held by members of the Ochs and Sulzberger families -- 826,756 were voted in favor of the proposal. No Class B shareholder voted against it.</p>
        <p>New York Times Digital operates the Web sites NYTimes.com, Boston .com, NYtoday.com, Golfdigest.com, Winetoday.com and Abuzz. It had $11.6 million in sales in the first quarter, triple the amount of the first quarter of 1999. But its losses also grew, to $10 million from $5.1 million, in the period a year ago.</p>
        <p>The company issued a statement yesterday saying that it would ''carefully consider market conditions prior to proceeding'' with a public offering of the new shares, which will be designated Class C. The chairman, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., said he could not comment on the number of shares to be issued, the offering price, or the possible issue date.</p>
        <p>The recent downturn in the stock market has made the climate chilly for initial public offerings. The few tracking stocks issued most recently have not fared particularly well. Shares of the AT&amp;T stock that tracks the value of its wireless division, which were sold to the public on April 27 at $29.50, rose to $35.25 on May 1 before starting a steady decline, closing yesterday at $24.4375.</p>
        <p>Ziff-Davis, the computer-oriented publishing company, issued a tracking stock for its Internet assets in March of last year. The offering price was $19; it rose to $34.5625 in early February, before falling to $10.5625 yesterday.</p>
        <p>Some analysts have argued that tracking stocks, which offer their shareholders no ownership stake, are confusing for investors. Michael Golden, vice chairman of the Times Company, told the shareholders at their meeting yesterday that an initial public offering would provide needed working capital. In addition, he said, the new stock could be offered as an incentive to help retain employees at the Internet divisions, whose competitors routinely make stock options part of basic compensation.</p>
        <p>Two other media companies -- Knight Ridder and the Tribune Company -- have also assembled their online businesses in separate units analogous to New York Times Digital, but neither has moved as far toward a public offering as the Times Company. Knight Ridder has scheduled an investor conference later this week to describe its Internet strategy.</p>
        <p>In January, the Times Company filed an initial registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the new share class.</p>
        <p>Shareholders also approved two nominees for the board of directors. They are David E. Liddle, a partner with U.S. Venture Partners and a retired chairman of the Interval Research Corporation, and Jacqueline H. Dryfoos, a psychotherapist in New York City.</p>
        <p>Shares of the Times Company closed at $38.6875 yesterday, up $1.0625.</p>
