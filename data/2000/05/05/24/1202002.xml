        <p>On his first Manhattan campaign stop as a Senate candidate, Representative Rick A. Lazio boarded the subway yesterday morning and criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton for tooling around in ''chauffeured limousines.''</p>
        <p>''This is the way most New Yorkers travel,'' Mr. Lazio said as he rode the No. 6 train uptown. A Long Island congressman, who has not failed to cite his New York roots over the last several days, had borrowed a MetroCard from a staff member and was laying claim to several subway rides in his lifetime.</p>
        <p>And just how much is a MetroCard? a reporter asked.</p>
        <p>''I think it's about $3,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>Well, not exactly. Yes, a round-trip subway fare is $3. But the cheapest MetroCard you can buy is a one-day, $4 fun pass that tourists use. Most regular subway riders buy cards ranging in price from $15 to $120.</p>
        <p>Bryan Flood, a spokesman for Mr. Lazio, said the congressman did know the single fare was $1.50 and said he should be excused if he could not immediately give a breakdown on MetroCard costs. ''Come on, how many people know the costs of MetroCards offhand?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>The minor episode demonstrated the potential pitfalls of Mr. Lazio's strategy of portraying himself as a ''real New Yorker'' more in touch with the people than the first lady, who moved to the state five months ago, while he was born in West Islip on Long Island. (For campaigning, she usually travels in a sedan or sport utility vehicle with a Secret Service escort.)</p>
        <p>It was not the only bump in Mr. Lazio's two-hour swing through Grand Central and then East Harlem, territory that historically belongs to Democrats. A smile never left his face as he held the hand of his wife, Patricia, and energetically reached out with his other hand to whoever would take it, even confronting a few hecklers shouting their support for Mrs. Clinton. But even some people who shook his hand wondered exactly who he was.</p>
        <p>''I knew Giuliani dropped out, but I didn't know who the new guy was,'' said Linda Forster, an accountant passing through the station who took one of the fliers Mr. Lazio's staff was handing out and shook his hand. ''I have no idea who I'm going to vote for so I will be listening to hear what he has to say.''</p>
        <p>At times it was difficult to discern how much was spontaneity and how much the kinks of a campaign only three days old and under pressure to catch up with Mrs. Clinton in the polls.</p>
        <p>Unlike most candidates, who tend to run late at their events, Mr. Lazio wandered with no evident path through the terminal, ignoring grumbles from commuters that the amoebae-like entourage of staff members and reporters was blocking their way, and later finished his East Harlem tour 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. He then accepted his own chauffeured lift, hopping into a campaign volunteer's Toyota Camry. ''We are not really structured yet,'' an aide said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Lazio seemed to relish the visit, if anything for the range of voters it brought him near.</p>
        <p>Morning rush-hour commuters at Grand Central spill in from the northern suburbs, a pivotal voting ground, and East Harlem is predominantly Hispanic, offering a way to reach minority voters that critics say Mr. Giuliani had not pursued.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mr. Lazio reiterated his hope for some of the $9 million Mr. Giuliani's campaign may turn over to the Republican National Committee and said he would welcome Mr. Giuliani's help on the stump.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio appeared to win some converts, many of whom said they would choose him less for his ideals than for their disapproval of Mrs. Clinton. ''I don't know much about him,'' said Joan Kessler, a 48-year-old lawyer, as she rode the subway with Mr. Lazio standing nearby, swaying with the motion of the car. ''I think he could be a nice, honest politician. And I am adamantly opposed to Hillary Clinton. I don't think she is a New Yorker.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 25, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about Representative Rick A. Lazio and his campaign appearance on the No. 6 subway line misstated the price of a MetroCard. While Mr. Lazio said it was about $3 and the article said the cheapest card was $4, both answers were wrong. Station vending machines sell a card for $1.50, good for one ride.</p>
