        <p>WHEN a party has been going full-tilt for nearly a decade, it tends to lose a little steam. If any restaurant has a right to slow down and show signs of fatigue, it's Mesa Grill, an instant hit on opening its doors in 1991 and still a downtown favorite, crowded and clamorous at lunch, and even more crowded and clamorous at night.</p>
        <p>Nine years later, the craze for Southwestern food and fashion has passed, and a new generation of restaurants have arrived on the scene, many of them right up the street in Mesa Grill's backyard. But if it's time to dim the lights and send the crowd home, somebody forgot to tell Bobby Flay.</p>

        <p>WHEN a party has been going full-tilt for nearly a decade, it tends to lose a little steam. If any restaurant has a right to slow down and show signs of fatigue, it's Mesa Grill, an instant hit on opening its doors in 1991 and still a downtown favorite, crowded and clamorous at lunch, and even more crowded and clamorous at night.</p>
        <p>Nine years later, the craze for Southwestern food and fashion has passed, and a new generation of restaurants have arrived on the scene, many of them right up the street in Mesa Grill's backyard. But if it's time to dim the lights and send the crowd home, somebody forgot to tell Bobby Flay.</p>
        <p>Despite the cookbooks, the television shows, and a second restaurant, Bolo, Mr. Flay has somehow managed to keep Mesa Grill alive and kicking.</p>
        <p>Southwestern food is not a cuisine. It's a grab bag of spices, flavors, colors and romantic associations that range from lurid sunsets to big green jalapenos to the paintings of Georgia O'Keeffe. In the wrong hands, this is a recipe for very bad, very silly food. Mr. Flay, to his credit, has seized on the Southwestern idiom and made it a natural part of his cooking language, without ever getting too serious.</p>
        <p>Two things set Mr. Flay apart. First, he goes after big flavors -- the taste equivalent of those sunsets -- and he knows how to get them. The thick, reduced bourbon and ancho chili glaze on his pork tenderloins, for example, is a swirl of sweetness, smoke and spice, nicely underlined by a tamale filled with creamy sweet potato and pecan butter.</p>
        <p>Second, he uses chilies and spices for flavor, not for heat. Sixteen-spice chicken sounds like a tongue-scorcher. It turns out to be a subtly handled, tingling orchestration of flavors, with an off-sweet sauce of caramelized mangos and garlic.</p>
        <p>There are times when the plate gets overloaded, or the spices conceal rather than reveal. A salad of spice-rubbed sea scallops, served with a relish of mango and green onions, fell flat both times I tried it, because the scallops were tasteless. It was like watching a play with a brilliant supporting cast and a star who phones in the performance. The house muffins, a sweet and colorful melange of blue and yellow cornmeal, dotted with bits of jalapeno pepper and nuggets of yellow corn, are unattractively oily.</p>
        <p>And the dessert menu, a big ingredient in Mesa Grill's success under the flamboyant, very talented Wayne Brachman, is in a transitional phase, with the recent departure of Mr. Brachman and the arrival of the more decorous Vicki Wells, formerly on the faculty at the French Culinary Institute. At the moment, she is emphasizing desserts with seasonal fruits, most appealingly in a bread and butter pudding with blackberries and raspberries, served with cassis and vanilla ice cream, and an orange-blackberry cake topped with a lighter-than-air meringue hat. After Mr. Brachman, however, Ms. Wells seems meek. That may change.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flay has kept only one dish from bygone years, a corn tamale stuffed with corn and firm, flavorful shrimp, in a roasted garlic sauce. It is the house classic, for obvious reasons -- simple, straightforward and irresistible. Mr. Flay could have stuck with a lineup of greatest hits like this, but he chose instead to adjust, tinker and invent.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere on the menu, new arrivals have kept the formula fresh, like a whole fish, fried so crisp it looks ready to shatter, with a winningly simple sauce of roasted tomatillos, ancho chilies and chipotle peppers, served with a side dish of smoky, spicy black rice.</p>
        <p>The sauces at Mesa Grill rarely disappoint. Gooseberry salsa adds real zip to a barbecued swordfish steak, and an orange sauce jazzed up with ancho chilies gives something like sex appeal to a roasted tuna steak. Barbecued duck inside a blue-corn pancake was a little dry and stringy, but its rich, sweetly fiery habanero sauce pretty much erased the deficit.</p>
        <p>If the dishes have changed, the decor sure hasn't. The banquettes still have the red cowboy-print upholstery that resembles kiddie pajamas, and the enormous documentary-style photographs on the wall, in glorious black-and-white, still look profoundly non-Southwestern. Still perplexing, too, is the system for welcoming and seating guests, which seems to unravel whenever there's a crowd, which is pretty much always.</p>
        <p>Service at lunch can be very slow and disorganized. At dinner it can be very fast. So fast that it's hard not to feel rushed. Tables are close together, the volume level wavers between loud and deafening and, to push the atmosphere closer to pandemonium, a thundering soundtrack can be heard -- or sensed -- late in the evening. Mesa Grill is not the restaurant for a heart-to-heart talk, but it's ideal for a screaming fight. Who would notice?</p>
        <p>A good way to get one going is to cruise the margarita list. It is an inspirational document, and a rebuke to the appalling inventions that have made the drink synonymous with everyone's worst cocktail memory. Laurence Kretchmer, an owner of Mesa Grill, is a tequila expert, and he has put together a list of fine tequilas that can either be sipped on their own or used to upgrade a standard margarita. Another deluxe touch is the option of substituting Cointreau or Grand Marnier for triple sec, in which case the formula of the drink is altered slightly to accommodate the richer flavors.</p>
        <p>There is only one nontraditional margarita, made with a splash of cactus-pear juice. It's the right cocktail for Mesa Grill -- a little unexpected, full of flavor, and fun without being ridiculous. That's the Flay way.</p>
