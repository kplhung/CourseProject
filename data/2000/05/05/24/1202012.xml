        <p>AT the end of a debate last week between New Jersey's Democratic contenders for the United States Senate, Jim Florio declared: ''I regard Social Security as the defining issue of this election.''</p>
        <p>Crowds did not leap to their feet with excitement, but Mr. Florio was satisfied that he had found a way to undermine his opponent, Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine advocates investing part of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market. To Mr. Florio, this amounts to a tycoon risking working families' futures while benefiting his Wall Street buddies. It fits perfectly with Mr. Florio's image of Mr. Corzine: he's not a real public servant, he just plays one on TV -- in his $2 million-a-week advertising monsoon.</p>
        <p>But late last week a year-old audiotape surfaced of Mr. Florio saying that he had ''no difficulty'' investing a small portion of the trust fund in stocks. In other words, Mr. Florio had spoken favorably of what he now calls Mr. Corzine's ''risky scheme.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio got his wish. Social Security is the defining issue of the election. But it's being used to define him, too. Mr. Florio called his taped comments a misstatement, but Mr. Corzine's campaign laughed all the way to the bank to withdraw more money for television ads about Mr. Florio's stumble. It fits perfectly with Mr. Corzine's image of Mr. Florio: he's the same pol New Jerseyans knew and loathed as governor for raising taxes by $2.8 billion after saying as a candidate that he foresaw no need for more taxes.</p>
        <p>The primary has always been a contest between no political experience and too much. Before Mr. Corzine began asking others for their votes, his political activity was so limited that he voted only sporadically. Mr. Florio, on the other hand, has been a political player for so long that to many voters he's like that wedding gift you move around the house for a few decades but never love no matter where it ends up.</p>
        <p>Seeking a Senate seat and a signature issue, Mr. Florio settled on Social Security a few months ago with an eye toward the state's elderly voters. Yesterday he told a group of them here that ''what you think about Social Security tells you a lot about what someone thinks about American values.'' He has linked his opposition to investing Social Security money to Franklin D. Roosevelt's vision of the retirement fund and has likened Mr. Corzine's position to Republicans who want to privatize Social Security. Yesterday he accused Mr. Corzine -- a major Goldman Sachs shareholder -- of standing to profit personally if the firm handles any Social Security investments.</p>
        <p>DOES he believe Mr. Corzine aims to deepen his already ankle-deep pockets? ''When you get to be a billionaire do you have your motivations to get more?'' Mr. Florio mused. ''I don't think so. But I don't know.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio's issue hit a speed bump. Earlier this year, the Corzine campaign found a May 1999 article from The New Jersey Jewish News saying Mr. Florio had told Jewish leaders that he had no problem with limited investment of Social Security funds. Mr. Florio said it was a misunderstanding.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Mr. Florio, Passover intervened. Rebecca G. Weiner, the Jewish News reporter who wrote the story, found a tape of Mr. Florio while cleaning her house of chometz, or food forbidden on Passover. After Mr. Florio said in a recent debate  that the reporter might have misunderstood, the paper released the tape. ''I have no difficulty with a relatively small, segmented portion of the Social Security trust fund monies being put into equities,'' he said, according to a transcript of the tape.</p>
        <p>''A misstatement,'' he said yesterday. ''The words on that transcript are not reflective of what I've been saying for 15 months and what it is I've been saying for 30 years.''</p>
        <p>The primary is also a contest between Mr. Florio's 30 years in public life and Mr. Corzine's $30 million campaign budget. With two weeks before the election, the money is speaking louder. Yesterday, Mr. Corzine's ads were saying this: ''Over 10 years ago, Jim Florio misled the voters and raised our taxes. This year, Jim Florio is misleading the voters on Social Security.''</p>
        <p>''Distortion,'' Mr. Florio cries. His own ads are coming.</p>
        <p>Whom to believe? How about Ms. Weiner? ''I did my Passover cleaning and I found the tape,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The moral of the story: In politics, as in Passover, beware the bread crumbs you leave behind.</p>
