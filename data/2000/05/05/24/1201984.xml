        <p>Since early December, the Sierra Club has been running television commercials that attack Gov. George W. Bush's environmental record in Texas. In this new 30-second spot, which is going on the air this week in St. Louis, Milwaukee, Detroit and Lansing, Mich., the organization is expanding its effort to portray the Republican as indifferent to the environment.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Haddow Communications.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Shots of two Texas residents, Ed Parten of Kingwood and Tamara Maschino of Seabrook, alternate with scenes of sewage spilling into waterways, smoke billowing from factories and a little girl being treated by a machine to assist her breathing.</p>
        <p>SCRIPT -- Mr. Parten: All of our lakes have water quality problems.</p>
        <p>Narrator: Texas leads the nation in the number of factories violating clean water standards.</p>
        <p>Ms. Maschino: We've got too many children on breathing machines, too many people with asthma.</p>
        <p>Narrator: Texas has the most industrial air pollution in the nation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Maschino: We're in a crisis situation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parten: We've contacted George Bush's office and he has the attitude that he's not interested.</p>
        <p>Narrator: Call George Bush. Tell him to oppose legislation in Congress that weakens penalties for clean air and water violators. For our families, for our future.</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- Governors in large states seeking higher office have to expect to run on their records, and the environment is an issue on which Democrats believe Mr. Bush is highly vulnerable; Vice President Al Gore regularly decries Mr. Bush's stewardship of a state that ranks in several categories as one of the nation's most polluted. Texas's vast and influential oil and chemical industries have yielded the state riches but also some pollution problems. Houston is among the nation's most smoggy cities, and the release of toxins into waterways is a growing problem. But just as the Sierra Club quotes from federal reports that describe Texas's environmental flaws, Mr. Bush can cite some advancements, such as an initiative to reduce emissions from older plants and the expansion of a program begun by his predecessor, Ann W. Richards, a Democrat, to reward companies that cut their toxic waste by half.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- The environmental advocacy group is spending $250,000 to run this commercial in four Midwestern and border states: Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan and, next week, Ohio, all of which are considered potentially decisive in the fall campaign. The Sierra Club started its advertising blitz two months before the New Hampshire primary and has emerged as one of the most active and visible special-interest groups of the campaign on television. It is planning to spend $8 million to raise public awareness of environmental issues. Mr. Bush's efforts to counter the club's assertions have been fairly low key, limited to events like a news conference in April in which he unveiled a plan to hasten the cleanup of abandoned industrial sites.</p>
