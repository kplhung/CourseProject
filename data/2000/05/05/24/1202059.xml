        <p>For the first time in its 106-year history, the British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer cut its dividend, as part of a struggle to revive profit and fight competition. The cut triggered a jump of 40 pence in its stock, to 260.75 pence. The 18 percent rise was the biggest one-day gain in 12 years, after the stock hit a nine-year low on Monday. The reduction in the dividend, from 14.4 pence, to 9 pence, was depicted by analysts as a bold move by the chairman, Luc Vandevelde, who took over last February after more than two years of declines in profits and share prices.</p>
