        <p>HERE is a guide to clams on the market:</p>
        <p>LITTLENECK: The smallest Atlantic hard-shell clam has a ridged gray to brownish shell and pale pinkish meat. Two-inch littlenecks, about the largest, are sometimes called topnecks. They are excellent on the half shell, broiled for a few minutes with a topping of herbs and bread crumbs or steamed open with garlic, wine and tomatoes. There are about 12 in a pound, usually sold for $4 to $6. Six to eight make a serving on the half shell, 12 or so in a pasta dish.</p>
        <p>CHERRYSTONE: The midsize Atlantic hard-shell clam can be eaten on the half shell and is also good chopped, seasoned, replaced in the shell and baked. Cherrystones can be put on a charcoal grill, seared until they pop open, about 10 minutes, and then brushed with lemon butter. They cost about 50 cents each. A serving is six.</p>
        <p>QUAHOG OR CHOWDER : Best opened raw or after steaming for 10 to 15 minutes, and chopped for chowders and clam pies. They cost 50 cents to $1 each, depending on store. An average quahog will yield half a cup of meat.</p>

        <p>QUAHOG OR CHOWDER : Best opened raw or after steaming for 10 to 15 minutes, and chopped for chowders and clam pies. They cost 50 cents to $1 each, depending on store. An average quahog will yield half a cup of meat.</p>
        <p>MAHOGANY: A deep-ocean hard-shell clam dredged off the Maine coast. This clam, about the size of a littleneck, has an attractive russet shell and tasty, briny meat. A trifle chewy when raw, but fine to steam or stew. The shells are thin and break easily, so they are hard to shuck raw. There are about 30 in a pound, and they come in two-pound bags for $4 to $6. Figure about half a pound to a person.</p>
        <p>MANILA: An Asian clam now cultivated in the Pacific Northwest that is best eaten cooked. Manilas range from tiny to littleneck size and are plumper, with better flavor, in the colder months. There are 30 to 60 in a pound, and they cost about $4 a pound. A serving is half a pound.</p>
        <p>STEAMER: An oval soft-shell clam, with a thin, white-streaked shell and a slightly protruding, rubbery black neck. It is best steamed and eaten with a butter dunk. Steamers are found in tidal areas along the East Coast. Large ones from Maryland and southern New Jersey are more readily available than the small, delicious ones from Maine. These are the easiest clams to shuck, but are not good to eat raw because the meat is too soft. A pound of Maine steamers contains about 35 clams; from other regions there can be as few as 20. Steamers are $4 to $6 a pound. About two pounds of steamers to a person.</p>
        <p>RAZOR: A long, soft-shell clam similar to a steamer, but with a more fragile shell. Very small razors can be eaten on the half shell, but most are too large, so they are better in ceviche or cooked in risotto or Asian recipes. The best sources are in Chinatown, where they cost about $5 a pound, with about a dozen to a pound and half a pound making a serving.</p>
        <p>GEODUCK: Like the steamer, the geoduck (pronounced gooey duck) gapes, and its extralong, serpentine black neck, or siphon, protrudes from the shell. Geoducks can weigh five pounds, with a neck a yard long. The body meat, not the neck, is prized for sushi and ceviche. Chinatown markets sell them for $7 to $10 a pound.</p>
        <p>COCKLE: The tiny cockle, imported from New Zealand, is technically not a clam but is suitable in many recipes calling for clams. Its greenish, ridged shell is almost round, and the meat tastes assertively of the sea, making it excellent in recipes with forceful seasonings like garlic and chilies. Cockles are often used by chefs as a garnish for baked fish, adding a nice briny flavor to the plate. Because the shells are so thick, they take a good six to eight minutes to open. Cockles cost about $4 a pound, with 20 or so in a pound. A serving is about a pound.</p>
        <p>SURF CLAMS: Big, chalk-white shells found on Atlantic beaches. They are harvested by dredging and then are chopped and processed to be sold as frozen and canned clams.</p>
        <p>And here is another tip: Instead of buying bottled clam juice, steam open a dozen littlenecks for a cup of fresh juice.</p>
