        <p>Dr. Robert G. Newman, an influential leader in New York health care, said yesterday that he would retire at the end of the year as president and chief executive of Continuum Health Partners, a consortium that includes Beth Israel Medical Center, St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital Center and the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, all in Manhattan, and Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Succeeding him will be Peter A. Kelly, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the company, one of the largest hospital systems in New York.</p>
        <p>Dr. Newman, a 25-year veteran of Beth Israel and its chief executive before the consortium was created, is best known for his expertise on drug addiction and treatment, particularly with methadone, of which he was an early proponent.</p>
        <p>Dr. Newman spent much of his time involved with often-unpopular causes, like needle exchange programs, methadone clinics for heroin addicts, health care programs for lesbians and do-not-resuscitate requests for terminally ill patients. Beth Israel was also among the pioneers in outpatient services for people with AIDS.</p>
        <p>In the last decade, he was also forced to focus on the rapidly changing world of health care finance, as government programs and managed care companies trimmed reimbursements to hospitals, which in turn grew fiercely competitive.</p>
        <p>When Continuum was created in 1997, the company quickly began offering more lucrative services, creating departments like its Institute for Neurology and Neurosurgery, and building up its cancer care to lure patients from the higher-profile  centers. He has worked hard to take  department heads from other local hospitals with fat contracts and promises of building their own departments.</p>
        <p>But all of the system's hospitals struggle with less lucrative departments. Just yesterday, rumors were swirling among the Beth Israel's pediatric staff members that the hospital would close the department. Dr. Newman denied that the program was scheduled to close, but added that each department in the system was under review for streamlining.</p>
        <p>Dr. Newman, who is 62, said that he would continue to take an interest in health care, but that he would not take a job anywhere else. ''The truth of the matter is that I have been thinking about this day just before I signed my initial contract 25 years ago,'' he said in an interview. ''I always wanted an early retirement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly, who is 53, is not a surprising replacement for Dr. Newman. He has worked closely with him for 20 years, and is well liked by Continuum's chairman, Morton P. Hyman. Mr. Kelly first came to Beth Israel in 1976, and he held a variety of positions before becoming chief operating officer in 1987. ''The agenda of Continuum will continue without missing a beat,'' he said.</p>
