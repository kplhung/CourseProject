        <p>UMBERTO'S CLAM HOUSE is reopening. I welcome this piece of news, not so much for the food as for the name, which is mercifully straightforward. Umberto's tells me it is an Italian restaurant. Clam House tells me I can get clams there. Both these statements are true, which tells me a third thing, that Umberto's is out of the loop.</p>
        <p>These days, Manhattan restaurants no longer sound like restaurants at all. They all have one-syllable or two-syllable names that suggest just about anything but food. Icon, Torch, Coup and Rain come to mind. So do Atlas, Commune, Local, Vox, Pop and Avra. Isla and Rain hover in the vicinity of actual meaning. Isla is Spanish for ''island,'' and the restaurant serves Cuban-influenced food. The two Rain restaurants offer pan-Asian cuisine. There's a lot of rain in Southeast Asia. But what about March? Or Quake? My current favorite is Tocqueville, because, rolling the name around on my tongue, I suddenly realized what the new-wave restaurant names suggest more than anything else: cars.</p>
        <p>To test my theory, I pitched it to Detroit. I knew you could eat at these places, but could you drive them off the lot?</p>
        <p>''Atlas is something we looked at before, for trucks,'' said Joe Pierucci, the marketing strategy manager for Ford's global products marketing department. ''It has the right associations of strength.'' Beacon, the Midtown restaurant that specializes in wood-grilled dishes, also seems to have potential in Detroit. ''That's probably a more economical car, or else it could be something that is just very huge,'' Mr. Pierucci said. ''You think of a beacon as something you can see 10 miles away.'' Jim Hall, an analyst at the consulting firm AutoPacific Group, likes Beacon too, but he sees a different vehicle. ''It would be a sensible car,'' he said, ''just a little bit out of the ordinary, enough to give it character, but essentially a middle-of-the-road car.''</p>
        <p>And Torch? ''After the Pinto, that's not a good car name,'' Mr. Hall said. ''But it would have been viable in the 1960's, perfect for one of those muscle cars with 9,000 horsepower and brakes that wouldn't stop a Plymouth Valiant.'' Mr. Hall also saw a few possibilities in Avra, the Greek seafood restaurant. ''It's not a bad name,'' Mr. Hall said. ''Unfortunately, it would probably be picked up by Hyundai or Daewoo.''</p>
        <p>Icon is already taken. In India, Ford markets its Fiesta as an Ikon.</p>
        <p>The Detroit lens has brought the Manhattan dining scene into focus for me. I couldn't imagine what sort of food Tocqueville might serve, but I could definitely see myself behind the wheel of a 1962 Cadillac Tocqueville, cream with turquoise interior. There's talk that Volkswagen might bring back the old VW bus. I propose Commune as the perfect name for it. Lex 303, a Murray Hill newcomer, sounds ready to drive right off the lot, a high-performance European import with a base price of $38,995. And I almost believe that I once owned a Plymouth Revel.</p>
        <p>It doesn't take a genius to figure out why a restaurant owner might go for a name like Icon. It's punchy, easy to read and easier to remember. It seems cool, in a vague way. Brand names in general have been getting less specific and more suggestive, as marketers chase after the elusive, highly profitable conglomeration of ideas, sensations and associations that add up to an image. The same thinking that has given the world companies like Unisys and Verizon was bound to creep into the restaurant business sooner or later.</p>
        <p>I sometimes riffle through the pages of ''Dining in New York,'' a guide to the city's restaurants printed in 1930. Back then, diners knew where they stood. The Chalet Suisse served Swiss food. Janssen's Midtown Hofbrau served German. Maison Louis was French. The Chilli Villa was Mexican. Ye Olde English Tea Room was English. Giolito's Venetian Garden was owned by a man named Giolito, featured Venetian food and had a garden.</p>
        <p>Life was simple. The food may have been terrible, but at least you knew what to expect when you walked through the door.</p>
        <p>Now, the intent is a lot more complicated. Then again, so is the food. Fusion cooking and the new internationalized American cuisine make the naming process doubly difficult. ''It's harder than naming a child,'' said Waldy Malouf, the executive chef at Beacon. His six-month naming odyssey had a starting point: the restaurant's open-fire cooking. He and his partners also wanted their name to communicate New York sophistication, friendliness, informality, accessibility and individuality -- in one word.</p>
        <p>Somewhere along the way, Mr. Malouf learned that in the 15th century, the English used to light fires along the coast to guide ships. Bonfire became Beacon.</p>
        <p>Explanations for the new names tend to raise more questions than they answer. ''Coup is French for 'hit,' '' said Davida Dambrosi, an owner of Coup. ''So it's like you get surprised when you're hit.'' Vox comes from the Latin expression vox populi. Fair enough. But why exactly?</p>
        <p>Tocqueville pleases the ear, but I can't say that I've cracked the code. An initial conversation with the restaurant's press agent yielded the following: ''Just as de Tocqueville wrote the definitive work on American democracy, so the owners wanted to create the definitive restaurant.'' This sounded like the kind of answer that students the world over come up with when facing a tough essay question on a book they never quite got around to reading.</p>
        <p>Marco Moreira, the chef and a part owner of Tocqueville, took a swing at it in a recent interview with The New York Observer, explaining that Tocqueville found Americans to be innovative and progressive, even though their background was European and conservative. ''So our cooking is European,'' he said, ''but American in that it's progressive.'' See?</p>
        <p>There's a lesson in this. Don't ask, just eat.</p>
