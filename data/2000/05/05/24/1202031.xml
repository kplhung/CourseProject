        <p>There are two debts to be settled at Vietnam Veterans Plaza.</p>
        <p>One is the debt owed by the landlord of 55 Water Street, an enormous office tower in Lower Manhattan, to the City of New York, which granted a substantial zoning bonus more than 30 years ago in exchange for a new plaza and a rebuilt Jeannette Park. The open spaces, now known together as Vietnam Veterans Plaza, never fully lived up to the role of public amenity.</p>
        <p>The other debt is owed by the city to those New Yorkers who served in Vietnam, particularly the 1,741 who lost their lives. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a wall of translucent glass blocks etched with the soldiers' own words, was built in the park 15 years ago. But it has never attracted its share of visitors.</p>
        <p>No wonder. It sits remotely on a barren expanse of brick. From Water Street, it is almost unrecognizable because it presents a blank edge to pedestrians. From South Street, the route to the Seaport, it is practically invisible because the plaza is several feet higher than sidewalk level.</p>
        <p>''I've seen people read the small sign saying 'Vietnam Veterans Plaza' and never enter,'' said Michael O'Connor, the senior vice president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, who served with the Army's 67th Engineer Company in the Mekong Delta in 1967. ''They just leave after scratching their heads, wondering whether the side of the monument is a refrigerator that someone discarded.''</p>
        <p>Visitors are not the only ones alienated. ''Veterans tend to shy away from the location because it's bleak,'' said Harry A. Bridgwood, executive vice president of the New Water Street Corporation, a subsidiary of the Retirement Systems of Alabama, which owns 55 Water Street.</p>
        <p>And the 27-year-old plaza does not comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act, Mr. Bridgwood said. Its numerous cascading levels are intriguing to contemplate but impossible to negotiate in a wheelchair. This is a remarkable shortcoming for a space that is supposed to welcome war veterans.</p>
        <p>A $6 million renovation began this month to make Vietnam Veterans Plaza more inviting, meaningful and accessible; to make it a ''a place of honor rather than a place of regret,'' in the words of Vincent McGowan, a sergeant with the Marines in Vietnam and vice president of Manhattan Vietnam Veterans of America.</p>
        <p>One can trace the evolution of America's attitude toward its Vietnam veterans in the physical development of the plaza. By the 1980's, there was consensus that some monument was needed -- not to the war itself, but to those who served. So the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial Commission raised the money to build a glass wall, 16 feet high and 66 feet long, inscribed with excerpts from letters, poems and diaries written by soldiers in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Its evocative power is undeniable. Yesterday, a casually dressed man in his 50's who had been scrutinizing the wall broke into tears when approached by another visitor. ''I can't talk,'' he said, and walked off.</p>
        <p>But the location of the memorial in a little-known park sandwiched between two skyscrapers seemed to signal continuing popular ambivalence about commemorating anything having to do with Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Now, the memorial is to be highlighted.</p>
        <p>''In 1985, we did something because we thought, 'We have to do something,' '' said Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who represents the area and was chairwoman of the Lower Manhattan community board 15 years ago. ''But we gave them Jeannette Park, a place that was uninviting and windswept. It was a gesture. Let's hope this time it's more than a gesture, that it's: 'We appreciate you. We respect you. Welcome home.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Freed has requested $500,000 from the City Council for the $6 million renovation and the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, has pledged $300,000.</p>
        <p>More than $1 million for the project was promised by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani at a ceremony last week marking the 25th anniversary of the war's end. ''In order to make certain that this memorial is appropriate and continues into this century as the kind of recognition that it should be,'' the mayor said, ''New York City is going to renew its commitment to it.''</p>
        <p>By far the largest contribution -- $3 million -- will come from the New Water Street Corporation, which has undertaken the project together with the Alliance for Downtown New York, which manages the business improvement district there; the Vietnam Veterans of America and the United War Veterans Council; the City Parks Department and City Parks Foundation.</p>
        <p>Wall Street has been much less forthcoming than expected in the fund-raising drive, Mr. Bridgwood said. In fact, he said, ''It's like pulling teeth.'' One institution, which he did not want identified publicly, responded to the solicitation by saying, ''We don't do war memorials.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the Plaza Construction Corporation donated its services as construction manager. The chairman and chief executive of Plaza, Steven Fisher, is the great-nephew of Zachary Fisher, a real estate developer who was instrumental in the creation of the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum.</p>
        <p>The renovation, designed by E. Timothy Marshall &amp; Associates of Highland Park, N.J., may be completed this year. Ramps will be added to the south and east sides, so that the plaza will comply with the disabilities act.</p>
        <p>A moatlike sunken staircase on the Water Street side, which once led to an underground shopping arcade and was supposed to connect to a future subway station, will be covered and planted with flowering trees.</p>
        <p>This will serve as a verdant gateway to a ''Walk of Honor'' leading directly to the memorial. Lining the walkway will be a dozen granite pylons, four and a half feet high, faced with stainless steel panels bearing the names of New Yorkers who were killed in action. The walkway will replace a brick ditch that was once a small landscaped canal but is now kept dry because it otherwise leaks into the offices below.</p>
        <p>Names on the pylons will be arranged alphabetically, together with the branch of service (but not rank) and the age at the time of death, to make the point that the sacrifice fell so heavily on young shoulders.</p>
        <p>Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern advocates the inclusion of a life-size sculpture of a water buffalo with a Vietnamese child astride it, to convey what he said would be ''a particular sense of time and place not normally found in commemorative statuary.'' Nearby, to complete the scene, would be a sculpture of a seated soldier, his helmet off, writing a letter home.</p>
        <p>Set into the pavement at the head of the walkway is to be a 10-by-20-foot terrazzo map of Vietnam, showing geopolitical landmarks of the war like the demilitarized zone along the 17th parallel and the Parrot's Beak, a region of Cambodia that cuts into Vietnam.</p>
        <p>On South Street, a semicircular ceremonial staircase will be built directly on axis with the memorial. Flags of the armed forces will be flown from new poles along the parapet of the wall.</p>
        <p>By purchasing 55 Water Street in 1993, the Retirement Systems assumed an obligation of the original developer, the Uris Buildings Corporation, to maintain Jeannette Park until 2064. The park seamlessly abuts a 35,525-square-foot, privately owned plaza that generated a zoning bonus of 355,250 square feet of space, about 10 percent of the total in the tower.</p>
        <p>But the renovation project goes well beyond the maintenance obligation. Mr. Bridgwood credited David G. Bronner, the chief executive of the Retirement Systems, with a special sensitivity to Vietnam veterans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bridgwood has a special sensitivity of his own. In Marine boot camp at Parris Island, S.C., in 1966, he befriended Pvt. James W. Cherrick of Staten Island. Though both volunteered for duty in Vietnam, Private Bridgwood was sent to Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba.</p>
        <p>Private Cherrick wound up in Vietnam. He was killed aboard a helicopter in Quang Tri on July 15, 1966. He was 19 years old.</p>
        <p>His name will be on one of the pylons. And his memory will not be far from Mr. Bridgwood's mind during the renovation. ''I feel obligated to make sure this thing gets done,'' Mr. Bridgwood said, ''and gets done right.''</p>
