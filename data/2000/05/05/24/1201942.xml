        <p>JAPAN: DYNASTIC POLITICS -- The youngest daughter of the late prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, announced that she would seek her father's parliamentary seat in elections scheduled for June 25. Mr. Obuchi died on May 14, after suffering a stroke six weeks earlier. The candidacy of his daughter, Yukio Obuchi, 28, a former broadcaster, has revived a debate about the prevalence of inherited parliamentary seats in Japan.</p>

        <p>PHILIPPINES: REBELS TALK -- Declaring that they wanted peace, about 100 Islamic rebels holding 21 hostages since April 23 emerged from their mountain lair in the southern Philippines for talks. The unexpected meeting between the Abu Sayyaf guerrillas and the provincial governor, Abdusakur Tan, revived hopes of a breakthrough in the stalled negotiations for the hostages' release. Mr. Tan said that the rebels repeated their demand for an Islamic state -- a demand consistently rejected by Manila -- and that the next meeting would take place at the earliest on Thursday.</p>

        <p>THAILAND: ROYAL RECORD -- King Bhumibol Adulyadej was declared the country's longest-living monarch, surpassing King Rama I, who died in 1809. King Bhumibol, 72, is also the world's longest-reigning monarch. He was only 18 when his older brother died and he assumed the throne in 1946.</p>

        <p>PERU: ELECTION MONITORS QUIT -- Transparencia, a Peruvian election observer group largely funded by the United States government, said it had so little confidence in presidential elections scheduled for Sunday that it was withdrawing its monitors from voting stations as a protest. The announcement came as the head of an Organization of American States observation team was trying to persuade aides of President Alberto K. Fujimori to put the election day off for a few weeks to fix any vote tabulation flaws in government computer software.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: GAIN FOR MAYORAL CONTENDER -- A Mexico City court turned down a challenge to the election credentials of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leftist candidate who has built a wide lead in opinion surveys in the city's mayoral race. President Ernesto Zedillo's governing party and two others had sued to block Mr. Lopez Obrador's candidacy, arguing he did not meet residency requirements. A five-magistrate tribunal disagreed, leaving Mr. Lopez Obrador's challengers four days to appeal the ruling to a federal court.</p>

        <p>CUBA: DISSIDENT LAWYER FREED -- The government freed Rene Gomez Manzano, a dissident lawyer, from prison in the third early release of a prominent anti-government activist in the last two weeks. The early release of Mr. Gomez, 56, who was serving a four-year sentence for anti-government activities, followed the freeing over the last two weeks of two of his close dissident colleagues, Felix Bonne, 60, an academic, and Marta Beatriz Roque, 55, an economist.</p>

        <p>NETHERLANDS: LOCKERBIE TRIAL DELAYED AGAIN -- Resumption of the trial of two Libyans in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, was delayed again by computer problems in the high-tech courtroom in Camp Zeist. The trial had been adjourned since May 11 to reschedule witnesses.</p>

        <p>SPAIN: AGREEMENT ON TERRORISM -- Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain and President Jacques Chirac of France agreed to step up cooperation against terrorism at a one-day summit meeting in the northern city of Santander. Although Madrid and Paris have long worked together against Basque militants, officials are now concerned at signs that Spanish Basque rebels are collaborating with radical French Breton nationalists.</p>

        <p>CONGO: TROOP WITHDRAWAL -- Rwanda, Uganda and the main rebel force operating in the Congolese diamond center of Kisangani have all agreed to pull troops out of the city, allowing the United Nations to establish the first neutral center for peacekeeping in Congo. The organization hopes to send South African troops.</p>

        <p>ETHIOPIA: VICTORY CLAIMS -- Ethiopia began a major attack on the central front of its disputed border with Eritrea, claiming by nightfall to have made significant advances. Eritrea, however, said it had repulsed the attack, and reported shooting down three Ethiopian fighter planes. Ethiopia said all its planes returned safely. Military analysts say this battle could be decisive: if Ethiopia dislodges the Eritreans from the town of Zalembessa, it will have forced Eritrea from the most important piece of land in dispute in the two-year war between the nations.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: NEW VIOLENCE -- Authorities imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and heavily armed troops patrolled the northern city of Kaduna after two days of clashes that filled hospital morgues and littered the streets with bodies. The fighting is the worst outbreak in Kaduna since riots in February between Christians and Muslims in which more than 1,000 people died. The cause of the latest violence is not clear.</p>

        <p>IRAN: PAPER CLOSED -- Hard-line judicial officials, stung by the victory of reform candidates, shut down a newspaper allied with the reformist president, Mohammad Khatami, a day after it began printing. It was the 19th publication closed in a crackdown that began last month. In the Feb. 18 voting, allies of President Khatami won about three-quarters of the 290 seats, depriving the hard-liners of control of Parliament, which they have had since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>
