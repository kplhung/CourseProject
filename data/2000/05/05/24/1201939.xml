        <p>Germany's defense minister accepted a recommendation today to drastically reform and shrink a draft-based army that is still set up to fight the cold war. But he stopped short of endorsing an all-professional army similar to those of other European countries.</p>
        <p>''The army is too big, ill-composed and increasingly out of step with the times,'' a government-appointed independent commission headed by Richard von Weizsacker, a former president, said in a report published today. ''The Bundeswehr has no future in its current structure.''</p>
        <p>The Bundeswehr, as the German armed forces are called, was formed in 1955 with an initial force of 101 volunteers. It has always reflected important principles of the postwar republic, among them allegiance to NATO and the rejection through a citizens' army of Prussian officer-caste militarism. So its reform is particularly sensitive.</p>
        <p>The defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, said in receiving the report: ''The Bundeswehr will become smaller. It will be cut by around 100,000 over the next five years.'' The size of the armed forces, including more than 100,000 civilian staff members, is 460,000, suggesting an overall reduction of about 22 percent.</p>
        <p>That falls short of the commission's proposal to cut the force by 30 percent. But Mr. Scharping, a Social Democrat, is aware of fierce resistance to wholesale reform among the officer corps, veterans and conservative Germans inclined to view change as dangerous.</p>
        <p>The discussion comes at a sensitive time, with a cash-strapped government committed to providing a substantial contribution to a new European rapid reaction corps of 60,000 troops supposed to be in place by 2002. It would operate within NATO but would be able to take on missions that the United States declined.</p>
        <p>NATO has for some time been pressing Germany -- now surrounded by allies for the first time in its modern history -- to follow other European countries like France and Britain in scrapping the draft, streamlining its operations and adopting an all-professional army largely set up for rapid deployment in trouble spots.</p>
        <p>Responding to those calls, the commission's report proposes slashing the scope of the draft so that just 30,000 people are conscripted each year instead of 130,000 -- an awkward attempt at compromise between the evident need for professionalization and enduring support for the draft, particularly among older Germans.</p>
        <p>The attempted compromise reflects the fact that Germany remains a special case. The history of the army's state-within-a-state militarism in the years between the two world wars has made the country deeply wary of completely abandoning the draft.</p>
        <p>The notion that service is part of a young person's education remains popular. And the still unstable east of the continent is much closer to Berlin than to Paris or London.</p>
        <p>''Our geographic position is special, and we do not yet have the long-term perspective of stability in the whole of Europe,'' said Lt. Col. Rudiger Trapp, an armed forces spokesman. ''That is one reason to keep some conscription.''</p>
        <p>An internal report prepared by Gen. Hans-Peter von Kirchbach, the armed forces chief of staff, favors a much smaller cut in conscription to about 80,000 a year, and Mr. Scharping is widely expected to favor this less radical proposal.</p>
        <p>He is also likely to settle for keeping troop levels at about 290,000, rather than the 240,000 suggested in the report, military officials said.</p>
        <p>The minister will face opposition from the Social Democrats' coalition partners, the Greens, who favor ending conscription. ''We again call for an end to mandatory conscription, a move that is legally correct and politically sound,'' said Angelika Beer, a defense expert for the Greens.</p>
        <p>It appears possible that selective conscription could prompt legal complaints of discrimination from those called up.</p>
        <p>Overall, the report amounts to a sweeping proposal to create a highly mobile, more professional army adapted to crisis management missions beyond Germany's borders rather than the former static role of defense against Soviet divisions.</p>
        <p>Germany's experience in Kosovo, where it has 7,300 peacekeeping troops, has provided ample evidence of the need for mobility. The commission proposes increasing the number of troops prepared for rapid deployment to 140,000 from 60,000.</p>
        <p>Germany spends 1.5 percent of its total output on defense, compared with 2.8 percent in Britain and France and more than 3 percent in the United States. Mr. Scharping faces heated debates within the cabinet in the next few weeks as he seeks to maintain the current military budget at a time when all departments are being asked for cuts.</p>
