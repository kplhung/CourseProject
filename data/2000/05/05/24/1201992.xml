        <p>For years, labor unions have been a thorn in the side of the UAL Corporation and the US Airways Group, and now that the two airlines are planning to combine, experts wonder if the unions have enough power to squash the deal.</p>
        <p>''The unions that were around at the beginning of this industry still have a hammerlock,'' said Sam Peltzman, an economist who specializes in airlines and regulatory issues at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. ''The industry is completely unionized.''</p>
        <p>Airline unions are so powerful, experts say, that they could pose huge problems not only in voting to approve UAL's proposed $4.3 billion takeover of US Airways, but in determining how and whether two major airlines can unite. That stumbling block, they say, even more than antitrust questions could be the airlines' No. 1 challenge.</p>
        <p>United Airlines employees control more than 50 percent of the airline, and most of its employees are members of one of several unions, like the Air Line Pilots Association.</p>
        <p>Last week, United's employee stock-option plan expired. The plan, some experts said, gave pilots de facto control of the airline and made it difficult for the company to dilute the pilots' ownership. Now that the plan has expired, experts say the company may have been granted the freedom to make a deal.</p>
        <p>Even so, employee ownership should not prove to be an obstacle to such a deal. The employee shareholders will each vote independently unless a movement develops to organize employees as a group or under the umbrella of the unions, according to the experts.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the major unions were unavailable to comment.</p>
        <p>The companies have each had labor problems. Most recently UAL had to cancel hundreds of flights this month after pilots refused to work overtime because of a lack of progress in contract talks. And US Airways averted a labor standoff this month when a union representing flight attendants voted to adopt a new contract.</p>
        <p>''As bad as labor relations are at United, it's worse at US Airways,'' said Aaron J. Gellman, director of the transportation center at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.</p>
        <p>To combine operations, the experts say that the unions that represent pilots, machinists, attendants and others will have to agree on everything from work rules and seniority lists to which hub should dominate a region.</p>
        <p>Indeed, these issues are so complicated that several experts say they have their doubts whether two major airlines can be successfully integrated. Airline mergers, they say, have typically involved larger airlines buying regional outfits, making a combination easier to achieve.</p>
        <p>''The problems are very formidable,'' Professor Peltzman said. ''The first issue you decide if you put two together is who's the senior pilot. They get at each other's throats over issues like this.''</p>
        <p>Professor Gellman said he had doubts about whether two major airlines could be merged successfully. The reaction of the pilots will be important, he said.</p>
        <p>''Do they see themselves as losing power or gaining in stockholder value?'' he asked.</p>
