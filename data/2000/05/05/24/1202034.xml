        <p>The television season officially ends tonight, but there is no doubt about the outcome: Regis won.</p>
        <p>ABC was the winning network, but that was largely on the strength of the game show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' ABC managed a clean sweep, winning in every significant category, from children to teenagers to young adults to total viewers to household ratings.</p>
        <p>Such a showing has not been achieved since NBC's dominance in the mid-1990's. Stu Bloomberg, the co-chairman of ABC Entertainment, noted that ABC had actually climbed from third place to the dominant position, a first for any network in one season.</p>
        <p>He and the other ABC co-chairman, Lloyd Braun, pointed out that ABC did have other strong series, including ''Dharma and Greg,'' ''The Practice'' and ''Drew Carey.'' But as far as top-rated shows went, NBC still topped the list with its Thursday night trio, ''E.R.,'' ''Friends'' and ''Frasier.'' ABC was represented by three editions of ''Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>ABC's highest-rated show with a script and actors was ''Drew Carey'' in 13th place.</p>
        <p>NBC was eager yesterday to point out that it has challenged ABC for supremacy in the May sweep that also ends tonight, and that it might tie or beat ABC despite ABC's reliance on more editions of ''Millionaire'' than in any previous sweep month.</p>
        <p>ABC may still win if the final episode for Michael J. Fox on ''Spin City'' posts a huge ratings number, as seems likely. But NBC will be close, much closer than it was in either the November sweep or the February sweep.</p>
        <p>NBC has accomplished that mainly on the strength of those three big Thursday night hits, whose season finales last week brought them their highest ratings in more than a year.</p>
        <p>None of that truly undercuts the turnaround engineered by Regis Philbin and ''Millionaire'' at ABC. For the season, ABC was up 20 percent in total viewers; 17 percent in viewers from age 18 to 49, the group most attractive to advertisers; 15 percent among children; and 6 percent among teenagers.</p>
        <p>NBC, CBS and ABC, took turns yesterday pointing out their high points of the season. For NBC, beyond the May sweep ratings, there was the strong performance of some new shows, ''The West Wing,'' ''Law and Order: Special Victims Unit'' and ''Third Watch,'' a new crop that certainly fared better than what ABC offered, other than ''Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>ABC added only one other new series that worked at all, the drama ''Once and Again,'' and even that was vulnerable at times, especially when slotted against the new CBS series ''Judging Amy.''</p>
        <p>That series was clearly a season highlight in comments from the CBS president, Leslie Moonves. CBS also emphasized that it finished the season second in total viewers, beating NBC.</p>
        <p>ABC had a hard time emphasizing anything because its attempt at a telephone news conference yielded as much humor as any comedy introduced by the network this season, with static accompanied by electronic beeps followed by the harried voices of ABC executives trying to get the phone company to fix the problems. Though dominant in the ratings, ABC finished last in conference calls.</p>
