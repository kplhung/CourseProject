        <p>As a teenager in Washington State, Neko Case lived in the south. South of Seattle, that is, in the gray industrial town Tacoma. Later, she moved to Vancouver, in the south of Canada. Now Ms. Case has relocated to Chicago, a decidedly northern burg. But she has already proved to a growing cult of aficionados that she's country through and through.</p>
        <p>Sharing a Thursday night bill at the Mercury Lounge with her pal and vocal match Kelly Hogan, Ms. Case did all the correct country things. Backed by a stylish band that included the guitarist Andrew Hopkins and the pedal-steel player Jon Rahouse, she yodeled and wailed in a genuine Virginia accent, picked up during her childhood years. She sang about heartache, hard knocks and ''murdering your date.''</p>

        <p>As a teenager in Washington State, Neko Case lived in the south. South of Seattle, that is, in the gray industrial town Tacoma. Later, she moved to Vancouver, in the south of Canada. Now Ms. Case has relocated to Chicago, a decidedly northern burg. But she has already proved to a growing cult of aficionados that she's country through and through.</p>
        <p>Sharing a Thursday night bill at the Mercury Lounge with her pal and vocal match Kelly Hogan, Ms. Case did all the correct country things. Backed by a stylish band that included the guitarist Andrew Hopkins and the pedal-steel player Jon Rahouse, she yodeled and wailed in a genuine Virginia accent, picked up during her childhood years. She sang about heartache, hard knocks and ''murdering your date.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Case, who once played drums in an all-woman punk band, did not become mired in stylistic precision. Like the country stars she most admires, including Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn, she used the genre's conventions to challenge propriety.</p>
        <p>In a black T-shirt and pair of men's pants she said were borrowed, Ms. Case looked more like a W.T.O. protester than a Grand Old Opry guest. Her powerful voice had an earthy edge, a slight constriction in the back of the throat adding poignancy to her declarations of freedom. She showed subtlety, too, something not that common among rockers who turn to country. On bittersweet songs like ''Porchlight'' and the torchy ''South Tacoma Way,'' Ms. Case unleashed the ache behind her rough and tumble attitude.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hogan, who was born in Atlanta but also lives in Chicago, sang harmonies throughout Ms. Case's set with a restraint that balanced her friend's vigor. Opening the show with the same band, she applied her own extraordinary voice to several covers and a few originals. With great flexibility and intelligence, she moved from torch songs to Stax-style rhythm and blues and bouncy swing. Those who came out to catch the hot Ms. Case found another star to follow in the cool Ms. Hogan.</p>
