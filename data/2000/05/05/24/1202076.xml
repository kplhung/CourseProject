        <p>Latrell Sprewell threw down a driving dunk with 2 minutes 44 seconds left in the third quarter, a flying-through-traffic, one-handed, film-at-11 play that briefly quieted the whooping and hollering at Conseco Fieldhouse and brought the Knicks to within 3 points of the Indiana Pacers.</p>
        <p>So impressive and forceful was the move, Sprewell had time to flex, scowl and stare coldly at Reggie Miller afterward -- as Jalen Rose, his man, beat Sprewell downcourt for a dunk of his own.</p>
        <p>It was not the defining moment in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. Nor did the momentary playground lapse illustrate Sprewell's strong night, which included 22 points in 41 minutes and many more hard drives to the rim.</p>
        <p>But Miller's obnoxious antics had already ticked off at least one opponent, made him focus on embarrassing Miller rather than on his defensive assignment. At that moment, Miller and his team's redemption tour officially began.</p>
        <p>''I don't particularly care for him, but hey, it's not about Reggie and I and what we do,'' Sprewell said after the Knicks fell, 102-88. ''Bottom line, he's a good player and I respect him as a player.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell was more than a little miffed by Miller's gum-flapping before the series, especially the part about the Knicks not respecting the Pacers.</p>
        <p>Their grade-school show of bravado began in the second quarter, when Miller knocked down a 3-pointer over Sprewell. Miller kept looking at Sprewell, until Sprewell began eyeing Miller.</p>
        <p>''He looked at him like, What are you looking at?'' Allan Houston said. ''That's the look Latrell gave him. I guess Reggie does that to everyone he makes a 3-pointer over. Whatever.''</p>
        <p>The game inside the game, a trump-this competition played by pro basketball's elite performers. It was good theater, a precursor for the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>By then, we will know how much Miller gets under the Knicks' skin and whether the Pacers have enough ammunition to take the revenge on New York that Miami could not.</p>
        <p>After Game 1, we already have a few developments.</p>
        <p>First, Austin Croshere should be guarded.</p>
        <p>The Pacers' sixth man killed the Knicks from beyond the arc. He finished with 22 points and made 4 of 5 3-pointers, consistently taking a kick-out pass as he rolled away from screens.</p>
        <p>''Our pick-and-roll coverage hurt us,'' Chris Childs said. ''You can't double-team Mark Jackson and not rotate to Croshere. He's too good. When he started coming off screens, we didn't stay with him.''</p>
        <p>Second, someone needs to block out Dale Davis.</p>
        <p>With 7 minutes left, Patrick Ewing wheeled into the middle of the lane and, with the shot clock running down, positioned himself to take an 8-foot jump shot. The Knicks were in desperate need of points, having falling behind by 11. They did not look worn down from their annual apocalyptic series against Pat Riley and friends as much as they looked befuddled by an offensive machine, a skilled pro basketball team capable of putting up 100, easy.</p>
        <p>So Ewing, New York's most effective option with 7-foot-4-inch Rik Smits on the bench in foul trouble, rose for that shot with every intention to make it a game. Davis rose, too. The Indiana power forward leaped so high he met Ewing's shot at its apex -- and sent it back to the floor along with the Knicks' aspirations for another improbable victory in enemy territory.</p>
        <p>A loud mob in the heartland went berserk, the people of Conseco standing and applauding their small-market heroes, who had taken care of Ewing and his rogue lot from the playground.</p>
        <p>Terre Haute and French Lick would sleep well tonight.</p>
        <p>Jeff Van Gundy? The Knicks coach has a few problems.</p>
        <p>Forty-eight hours after taking Game 7 from the Heat, the Knicks were essentially done in by two significant Pacer runs. The first came in the first quarter, a 35-17 binge that forced the Knicks to play catch-up.</p>
        <p>The second was even more costly. They crept to within 2 points at 68-66 in the third quarter and were then pounded in the fourth.</p>
        <p>Most of the Knicks were blaming their first-quarter collapse on malaise. They looked out of sync on defense. Maybe it was the shifting of gears over 48 hours, the way they had to prepare for different weapons and try new offensive schemes. Maybe the Heat series was draining enough to take its toll, so by the time the Knicks awoke in the second quarter it was already too late.</p>
        <p>Either way, a year after they stunned Indiana on its home court in Game 1, the Knicks fell apart early and could not recover late. For a team intent on returning to the finals, it was not a good omen.</p>
        <p>''They outplayed us,'' Childs said. ''We were on our heels. We gave them everything and took away nothing.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell said: ''We weren't into that game. Although we got back in it, we expended a lot of energy getting there. We didn't have that fire.''</p>
        <p>About the time Rose beat Sprewell and everyone downcourt for a dunk, it was long extinguished.</p>
