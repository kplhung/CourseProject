        <p>Trade rumors are like office gossip for players, and many Yankees whispered to one another and reporters today, asking about all the names that are circulating. Like most gossip, however, substance is outweighed by reality. The Yankees are evaluating a handful of hitters for possible trades, with Oakland's Matt Stairs and Baltimore's B. J. Surhoff heading their list. Officials with other teams do not have the impression the Yankees are rushing to make a deal -- although everybody involved understands that with a few more losses, the principal owner George Steinbrenner may force his executives to make a deal.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing close to happening right now,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, who spoke today with General Manager Brian Cashman. Mark Newman, the vice president of baseball operations, did not return phone messages, and neither did Cashman, Steinbrenner or Billy Connors, the vice president of player personnel.</p>

        <p>Trade rumors are like office gossip for players, and many Yankees whispered to one another and reporters today, asking about all the names that are circulating. Like most gossip, however, substance is outweighed by reality. The Yankees are evaluating a handful of hitters for possible trades, with Oakland's Matt Stairs and Baltimore's B. J. Surhoff heading their list. Officials with other teams do not have the impression the Yankees are rushing to make a deal -- although everybody involved understands that with a few more losses, the principal owner George Steinbrenner may force his executives to make a deal.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing close to happening right now,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, who spoke today with General Manager Brian Cashman. Mark Newman, the vice president of baseball operations, did not return phone messages, and neither did Cashman, Steinbrenner or Billy Connors, the vice president of player personnel.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are winning at a rate that would lead to 97 victories over a full season, but Steinbrenner and others are concerned about the team's run production, which currently ranks 13th in a 14-team league. Even Torre suggested the Yankees need to get a little more consistent in their offense, saying that it ''is an important time for everybody.''</p>
        <p>As the team lost games in Cleveland over the weekend, Steinbrenner called for most of his executives to gather in Tampa, Fla., in the latest meeting of the many meetings Steinbrenner calls every year. They ran through lists of hitters who might help their team, some of whom might be unobtainable, some whose teams might ask for more than the Yankees want to surrender.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' preference is for a left-handed hitter. They discussed Stairs repeatedly with the Athletics in the last few months, and did so again today, with the two sides entrenched: the Yankees want Stairs but do not want to part with either the top shortstop prospect Alfonso Soriano or pitcher Ramiro Mendoza, offering minor league pitching instead. If the Yankees ever agreed to part with Soriano, it figures they would want to expand the deal to include the Class AA pitcher Jesus Colome, someone they covet.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have asked the Orioles about what it would take to get Surhoff, and have been told Soriano must be included in the swap.</p>
