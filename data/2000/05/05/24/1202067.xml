        <p>Phil Jackson, master coach and student of the Zen religion, tried to sound philosophical about the Game 2 beating administered to his Los Angeles Lakers. But even he was grasping for ways to understand fully the reality of his team's worst loss of the season.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of Portland's</p>
        <p>106-77 victory on Monday night, the Lakers found themselves needing to soul-search even more than the Trail Blazers did after Game 1.</p>
        <p>Losing their focus in the playoffs again struck down the Lakers, who seemed dazed and confused after being outscored by 28-8 by Portland in the third quarter. Now, with the four-of-seven-game Western Conference finals tied, 1-1, the Lakers face the pressure of recapturing the home-court advantage on the road, where they are 1-3 during the playoffs. Game 3 is Friday night at the Rose Garden.</p>
        <p>The Lakers summed up their situation late Monday night with one word scrawled on their locker room blackboard: ''Onus.''</p>
        <p>They might also want to write down a plan for stopping Portland's three stars: Rasheed Wallace (29 points, 12 rebounds), Steve Smith (24 points) and Scottie Pippen (21 points, 11 rebounds). Wallace and Smith caused the most damage, scoring 11 points apiece in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>''There's explanations for things and then there's explanations for things,'' Jackson said today. ''It's the same old thing for us. We've got to find a way to get ourselves upright again and back in the attack mode. We didn't play with the same kind of urgency. The shots that went in Saturday just didn't go in Monday.''</p>
        <p>Not many bounces went the Lakers' way. They were outrebounded, 49-34, and outshot by 45 percent to 39 percent. Instead of playing Hack-a-Shaq, the Trail Blazers attacked Shaquille O'Neal head-on and eventually broke down the Lakers' defense. Portland dominated inside, outscoring the Lakers, 52-30, in points scored in the lane.</p>
        <p>When the collapse came in the third quarter, it was stunning. The Trail Blazers at one point scored 20 unanswered points, extending their lead from 56-51 to 76-51 in 6 minutes 3 seconds. Kobe Bryant finally scored for the Lakers, making two free throws with one second left.</p>
        <p>Jackson felt his team's desperation, too, and second-guessed himself for not calling a timeout to try to shift the momentum to the Lakers.</p>
        <p>''I completely blew that one,'' he said. ''A team that's going to have to go on the road and survive has to right itself in a situation like that. There was never a play in that run that fit my description for a timeout.  I wanted them to try and find their own way back out of that morass and they couldn't do it.''</p>
        <p>It is a simple formula for the Lakers: Work the ball around the triangle offense, hit the outside shots to take the pressure off O'Neal and open the lane for him to operate. Jackson said the Lakers actually tried to get the ball to their center too much once they started missing their outside shots.</p>
        <p>O'Neal finished with 23 points, but had only 9 after three quarters. He was held to 6 points in the first half. Mostly, he was hounded and surrounded by the human shield of Arvydas Sabonis, Wallace and Pippen.</p>
        <p>Bryant was the only other Laker in double figures with 12 points.</p>
        <p>''The first half was just awful and we were only down by 3 points,'' Jackson said. ''I went into the locker room and said, 'If that's as good as they can do with us playing that poorly, we surely can play a much better second half.' I just couldn't imagine us playing any worse.</p>
        <p>''We got a little desperate there. You have to give them credit.''</p>
