        <p>IN THE HEART OF THE SEA  The Tragedy of  the Whaleship Essex  By Nathaniel Philbrick  Illustrated. 302 pages. Viking. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Sea survivals are a kind of theology; they bring you to the human edge, face to face with God. And so it was with the sinking of the whaleship Essex in 1820, deep in the Pacific. The story of the Essex also has literary significance. Attacked two times by a sperm whale -- even reported as a white whale in a contemporary account told to Ralph Waldo Emerson -- the tragedy of the Essex gave Herman Melville the idea for ''Moby-Dick,'' the quintessential American novel.</p>
        <p>In his book ''In the Heart of the Sea'' Nathaniel Philbrick, a research fellow at the Nantucket Historical Association, tells the entire harrowing story in workmanlike and authoritative fashion. He begins with a brief history of Nantucket itself, provides interesting background notes on the Nantucket whaling industry (a mid-19th-century precursor to the oil business) and describes the financial arrangements made before the departure of the 87-foot, 238-ton Essex from port on Aug. 12, 1819.</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbrick, in other words, provides early notice that his account is going to be a richly contextualized one, and it is throughout. By the end we learn a good deal about the ''punishing regimen'' of whaling itself as well as about the officers and crew members who embarked on the Essex -- seven of whom were black -- and about the culture of Quakerism and profiteering that characterized Nantucket society at that time.</p>
        <p>''No matter how much the inhabitants might try to hide it,'' Mr. Philbrick writes, ''there was a savagery about this island, a blood lust and pride that bound every mother, father and child in a clannish commitment to the hunt. . . . There was rumored to be a secret society of young women on the island whose members pledged to marry only men who had already killed a whale.''</p>
        <p>Disaster struck more than a year after the Essex's departure. The ship was about 2,000 miles off the North American coast in a newly discovered whaling area in the Pacific when a huge sperm whale, almost as long as the ship itself, suddenly rammed it with its immense head. Whales, even very big ones, normally flee in panic from a ship, and the first ramming could have been an accident. But then this mysterious prototype for Moby Dick himself came back and rammed the ship a second time, sinking it.</p>
        <p>The crew members managed to get a supply of hardtack and fresh water off the ship before it went down and left them with three functioning whaleboats, which they rigged with masts and sails, and several thousand miles of open Pacific to navigate. What ensued was a voyage of unspeakable hardship, which the survivors survived by eating those who died.</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbrick focuses especially on two very contrasting figures, the Essex's captain, George Pollard Jr., and its first mate, Owen Chase, the one an honorable man but of uncertain convictions, the other tougher, stronger but of questionable judgment. After the shipwreck Pollard sensibly wanted to use the prevailing wind to sail the whaleboats west across the Pacific to the Marquesas, about 1,200 miles away, or to Tahiti few hundred miles farther. But Chase and others on the ship were powerfully affected by stories they had been told in Nantucket about cannibalism among the natives of those islands, and they persuaded Pollard to sail due south instead, until westerly winds south of the equator could take them to South America.</p>
        <p>''The men of the Essex,'' Mr. Philbrick writes, ''were the victims of their particular moment in the history of the whale fishery.'' A few years later, as the Nantucket ships ventured farther and farther west in their search for whales, they became familiar with the central Pacific islands, where cannibalism was not practiced. But in 1820 ''these islands were outside the bounds of what they considered to be reliable knowledge.'' The eerie paradox is that the transfixing fear of cannibalism among the mate and crew members of the Essex is what led them to become cannibals themselves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbrick, relying on a long-ago published account of the Essex disaster by Chase and a more recently discovered manuscript by the Essex's cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, provides a detailed and disturbing narrative of the three months the survivors spent in their whaleboats before they were rescued off the South American coast.</p>
        <p>At one point on Captain Pollard's boat, the four remaining men cast lots to determine who would be shot and eaten by the others. The loser was Pollard's cousin, a teenage boy named Owen Coffin, who was duly shot and consumed. Of the 20 men who were aboard when the ship sank (one of the black sailors abandoned ship during an earlier stop in South America), nine died, several of whom were eaten.</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbrick addresses the question of cannibalism head on, as well as another strange aspect of the Essex story: the first to die and the first to be eaten were blacks. One possible explanation for this, Mr. Philbrick writes, was that the blacks had an inferior diet to that of the whites before the sinking and thus perished sooner. Another reason, Mr. Philbrick says, may be that blacks as a group have less body fat than whites. In any case, he makes clear, the fact that the first four men to be eaten were black remained a source of embarrassment for abolitionist Nantucket ever after.</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbrick gives an account of what happened to the survivors in later years, and he traces Melville's interest in the Essex and his use of it in his mighty book. ''Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect,'' Melville wrote of the white whale. The point of ''Moby-Dick'' is that whales have no malice. They represent the blind brute force of nature. So, most likely, did the whale of Mr. Philbrick's well-told story of a real-life instance of that blind, brute force.</p>
