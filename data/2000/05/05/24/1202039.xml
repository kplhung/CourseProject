        <p>Topics editorial hails indications that ivory-billed woodpecker, generally thought to be extinct, may have survived in Louisiana and Cuba</p>

        <p>In the late 1950's, the ivory-billed woodpecker vanished from its historic range in the United States and the Caribbean. Though not officially declared so by any government, the bird was generally thought to be extinct. But according to the latest issue of Audubon, the magazine of the National Audubon Society, ornithologists in both Louisiana and Cuba now believe that a few ivorybills may still be alive. The bird originally ranged from Ohio and Indiana in the north to the islands of the Caribbean in the south. The ivorybill largely relied on dense, tall stands of pine trees. When these began to disappear, so did the bird.</p>
        <p>From time to time sightings have been reported, but invariably these have been written off as glimpses of the lookalike pileated woodpecker, a smaller version that averages 16 inches in length compared with the ivorybill's 19 inches. But about a year ago, David Kulivan, a forestry major at Louisiana State University, emerged from a forest in the Pearl River area of eastern Louisiana with the news that he had seen not one but two ivorybills at fairly close range. His report was given credibility because he knows the Pearl River woods and their wildlife, and would not easily have confused the ivorybill with anything else.</p>

        <p>This belief in a bird that may yet turn out to be non existent has already produced salutary results. Louisiana has placed a two-year moratorium on timber cutting in parts of the state so as not to destroy any more of the bird's habitat. Meanwhile the National Audubon Society is giving technical assistance to Cuban ornithologists, who have fanned out across Cuba's 123,000-acre Sierra Maestra, once an important part of the ivorybill's range.</p>
        <p>One likes to think the bird is enjoying its notoriety.</p>
