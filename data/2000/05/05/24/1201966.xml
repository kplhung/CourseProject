        <p>Even though he has not practiced law since 1982, President Clinton has kept his license current by sending a $100 annual renewal check to the Arkansas Supreme Court, the registry of lawyers in his home state.</p>
        <p>The president cherishes his law license and does not want to lose it, several of his friends and associates said, although he has said he does not intend to use it after he leaves the White House in January.</p>
        <p>But with a disciplinary committee appointed by the Arkansas Supreme Court recommending the president's disbarment on Monday, citing his ''serious misconduct,'' Mr. Clinton faces the possibility of losing the license he has held since 1973.</p>
        <p>For the president, whose lawyers are fighting his disbarment, the stakes are high because Mr. Clinton is concerned that his legacy would be tarnished if he became the first president to be disbarred while in office. The consequences of disbarment could be practical as well as symbolic. If his state license is revoked, it would be almost impossible for Mr. Clinton to practice law in another state, like New York, unless he could persuade the Arkansas authorities to reinstate him, legal experts said.</p>
        <p>Some White House officials and allies of the president grumbled today that the panel, the Committee on Professional Conduct of the Arkansas Supreme Court, had recommended such a harsh penalty simply because it was the president.</p>
        <p>Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, called the panel ''a kangaroo court'' that was unworthy of respect. ''They've already gotten their pound of flesh,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''What more do they want?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is accused of lying under oath in a deposition in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual misconduct case in January 1998 when he denied having a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>The president's personal lawyer, David E. Kendall, has argued that similar cases against lawyers accused of lying under oath usually ended in temporary suspensions or lesser penalties, like a reprimand.</p>
        <p>An examination of recent decisions found several cases similar to Mr. Clinton's, most of which resulted in a written reprimand. In one case last year, the committee ordered a reprimand for a lawyer who had ''knowingly made a false statement to a tribunal.''</p>
        <p>An expert on Arkansas disciplinary decisions said today that he could not recall a single case in which an Arkansas lawyer was disbarred for making false statements under oath. ''This is unique,'' said Howard W. Brill, a law professor at the University of Arkansas. ''I have never found any situation where lawyers were disbarred simply for making false statements, unless they led to some kind of perjury charges or some kind of criminal sanctions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has the misfortune of facing disciplinary charges at a time when lawyers in Arkansas say the State Supreme Court has come down hard on lawyers accused of unethical behavior.</p>
        <p>''In the last 5 or 10 years, we have had some high-profile lawyers and public officials commit ethical violations, and had criminal convictions,'' Mr. Brill said. ''I think the toughening of punishment corresponds to a dramatic increase in criminal violations and front-page stories.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brill said he was struck by the Supreme Court's decision in a November 1998 disciplinary case. The court had withheld a law license from a former dentist who had been convicted of insurance fraud. The Supreme Court rejected the former dentist's application, partly because of the fraud, but also because he had not been truthful about his past in his application for a license.</p>
        <p>''There is simply no place in the law for a man or woman who cannot or will not tell the truth, even when his or her interests are involved,'' the court wrote in its decision. ''In the legal profession, there must be a reverence for the truth.''</p>
        <p>Members of the disciplinary panel defended the disbarment recommendation. The committee has 14 members, both lawyers and nonlawyers, who normally sit in panels of seven. Only six members, five lawyers and a retired schoolteacher from Little Rock, sat on the panel that recommended the president's disbarment because eight members had recused themselves. The party affiliations of the six members who voted were unavailable today.</p>
        <p>One of the panel members, Ken Reeves, a lawyer in Harrison, Ark., said politics did not enter into the panel's deliberations or the decision.</p>
        <p>''We approached this as we would any other lawyer,'' said Mr. Reeves, who described himself as nonpartisan. ''I think everybody voted their conscience as they would when dealing with any other lawyer, and we knew we would be roundly criticized no matter how we voted.''</p>
        <p>Another member said, ''There was no mean-spiritedness'' among the committee's members, who met Friday.</p>
        <p>Most of the eight members who recused themselves cited conflicts of interest. Five members had given money to one of Mr. Clinton's campaigns or Democratic causes.</p>
        <p>''I've met Clinton, as most people have,'' said Bart F. Virden, 40, a panel member who said he recused himself because he disapproved of some statements made by the leader of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, the conservative organization from Atlanta that pressed for the president's disbarment. ''It's distasteful how they're using the process,'' Mr. Virden added.</p>
        <p>The disbarment case will now be heard by one of five circuit court judges who sit in Little Rock, all of whom are registered Democrats.</p>
        <p>One of the judges, Morris Thompson, will most likely not be eligible for the assignment. Earlier this month, the Arkansas Supreme Court ordered his removal from office.</p>
        <p>The state's Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission found that Judge Thompson had practiced law on the side, written 59 bad checks and had illegally switched tags on several of his vehicles.</p>
