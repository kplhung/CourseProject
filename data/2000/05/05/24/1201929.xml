        <p>Spanish wines are offered at growing number of New York restaurants, non-Spanish as well as Spanish (S)</p>

        <p>THE first place to look for Spanish wines is obvious: Spanish restaurants. Solera, Marichu and Meigas have well-chosen selections. Both Solera and Meigas have a solid lineup of reds from Rioja and Ribera del Duero. Marichu is more eclectic, with roses from Navarre and Rioja, albarinos from Rias Baixas, and reds from Carinena, Cigales and Emporda-Costa Brava. All three restaurants carry whites from the up-and-coming Basque winery Txomin Etxaniz.</p>
        <p>Several pan-Latin restaurants maintain serious Spanish lists, notably Patria, Chicama and Bolo. Patria offers a stellar list packed with reds from Rioja, Ribera del Duero, Penedes and Priorat and also serves nine Spanish wines by the glass.</p>

        <p>Outside the orbit of Spanish and pan-Latin restaurants, surprises abound. Restaurant Daniel's surprisingly long list of Spanish reds includes top Priorat makers like Daphne Glorian and Alvaro Palacios. Morrell Wine Bar &amp; Cafe, although tiny, offers nearly 20 Spanish wines, with three reds by the glass: Pradorey from Ribera del Duero, Rivola Abadia Retuerta from Sardon del Duero and Baron de Ona Reserva from Rioja.</p>
        <p>Gotham Bar and Grill's list of 24 Spanish reds includes five vintages of the legenday Vega Sicilia from Ribera del Duero, and Gramercy Tavern's ever-changing list carries anywhere from 25 to 50 wines from Spain.</p>
        <p>Veritas's long Spanish list offers unusual opportunities, with a dozen vintages of Vega Sicilia going back to 1972, and Riojas from Marques de Riscal back to 1925.</p>
