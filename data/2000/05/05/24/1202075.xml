        <p>Bodies were careening and banging in the mosh pit around the paint as Indiana's unassuming Austin Croshere slipped outside of the Knicks' attention like a lost thought. He wasn't important, was he?</p>
        <p>In a far different but equally important way,</p>
        <p>Croshere tonight stole the X-factor role that Marcus Camby once inspired in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals that played out inside Conseco Fieldhouse.</p>
        <p>Croshere did not operate in Camby's zero-gravity world -- where the Knicks' waifish forward seemed to defy logic last year against the Pacers with his levitating moves -- but simply anchored himself behind the 3-point arc like someone seated in a waiting room.</p>
        <p>He just hung out. As Camby and others busily tried to trap Mark Jackson, Jalen Rose and Reggie Miller on pick-and-roll plays, Croshere bided his time until his teammates found him wide open. It happened over and over during the Knicks' 102-88 loss. After giving up 10 of 15 3-pointers -- including 3 of 3 in the fourth quarter to Croshere -- the Knicks fell behind the Pacers, 1-0, in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>''It's a tough assignment,'' said Camby, who was also boxed out by Croshere and finished with 4 points and 8 rebounds. ''Croshere had a lot of uncontested threes.  We'd trap, they'd see him and he'd make the shot. Indiana has a lot of big-time players. And he has become one of them.''</p>
        <p>This was so different for the Knicks. Their tendency to procrastinate had not hurt them against fragile opponents with limited options on offense. But the Pacers can also treat adversity like an adrenaline kick just as well as the Knicks. Once the Knicks melted down a 19-point, first-quarter deficit to a flimsy 2 points at the start of the third quarter, Reggie Miller (19 points) and Jalen Rose (17 points) started to jackknife around screens, pull up for jumpers and ruin the Knicks' shot at momentum.</p>
        <p>Maybe the Knicks were too worn down to muster the final push after a draining seven-game series ended in Miami just 48 hours earlier.</p>
        <p>''Maybe so, I don't know,'' said Larry Johnson who was partly responsible for Dale Davis's 14-point, 16-rebound night. ''We just gave up too many easy baskets.''</p>
        <p>Even when the Knicks had a chance to shake the Pacers, they blew a defensive assignment. In the third quarter, Latrell Sprewell darted through the lane, mocked the Pacers' interior defense and went in for a one-handed dunk to cut the Pacers' lead to 3 points with 2 minutes 44 seconds left. As Sprewell glared at Miller, Rose darted out on the break caught a full-court pass from Jackson, and responded with his own dunk.</p>
        <p>''Jalen would not have gotten that dunk back on me, but I was showboating,'' Sprewell said. ''But somebody's got to help out.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell didn't help himself much. He shut Rose down in the first half, held him scoreless, but then watched his man score 17 second-half points. Sprewell, who finished with 22 points, scored just 1 point in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>With Allan Houston (18 points) too slow in reacting on defense to track Miller's every move, the most effective offensive player on the floor was Ewing.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't at my best,'' Houston said. ''I was a little sore, but I'm not going to make any excuses. They did a better job. They outhustled us and made the big plays when they had to. They didn't lose their composure.''</p>
        <p>Although he was painfully slow to reach Rik Smits -- who hit 5 of his first 6 shots to send the Pacers on a 19-point, first-quarter lead -- Ewing did have success in the post. He had 18 points through three quarters, but did not appear in the fourth until the Knicks trailed by 11 points with 7:26 left. Was that too late?</p>
        <p>''That doesn't deserve a comment,'' said Ewing, who scored 3 points in the fourth. ''We played hard, but we dug a hole early and we lost the game.''</p>
        <p>They never managed to grab the lead. Unlike the Heat and the Raptors before them, the Pacers showed they can respond to dire situations. They can also make free throws, hitting all 12 they took tonight.</p>
        <p>''We understood they were coming off an emotional game to Miami,'' Miller said. ''We thought they may have been tired, and they were. We got into the game early.''</p>
        <p>Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy was less than pleased at the lazy defense that opened the game. He called repeated timeouts until the Knicks finally snapped out of it with a 20-6 run to cut the Pacers' lead to 52-48 at the half.</p>
        <p>''We were ill prepared for their intensity at the start of the game,'' Van Gundy said. ''The game was very, very easy for the Pacers tonight. They were ready. We wasted a quarter and got beat.''</p>
        <p>They got beat a variety of ways. They allowed the Pacers to shoot 48 percent from the field, were outrebounded by 43-35, and did not have that extra something. Like an X-factor. ''I was telling someone that Camby was their X factor last year,'' Miller said. ''Austin is going to have to be that for us. He extends their defense, and draws their big guys outside. He opens things up for everyone.  But this is going to be a long series. This is going to be a dogfight.</p>
        <p>''I'm more worried about Thursday's game. They know what to prepare for now.''</p>
        <p>Game 2 will arrive on Thursday in Indiana. With one day to prepare, the Knicks will have to regroup. ''I think we will recover,'' Sprewell said. ''We're a strong team. We've shown good character throughout the playoffs. We'll be ready for the next game.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>In six trips to the conference finals, Indiana had never won Game 1. In their last five postseason meetings with the Knicks, the winner of Game 1 has gone on to win the series. . . . CHRIS CHILDS, the hero of Game 7 in Miami, missed the shoot-around Tuesday morning because of the flu. He played 12 minutes and scored 4 points. . . . For several minutes after the game, MARCUS CAMBY received treatment on his sore right knee. When asked about it, Camby shrugged it off and said he was fine.</p>
