        <p>In what appears to be a strong new risk factor for progression of breast cancer, high levels of insulin in the blood augur badly for women with the disease, a Canadian study reported here today has found.</p>
        <p>Women with breast cancer and high levels of insulin who received standard therapy were about eight times more likely to develop a recurrence and die of the disease than women who had normal insulin levels, said the study's leader, Dr. Pamela J. Goodwin of the University of Toronto.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goodwin said the study found that insulin, a hormone, was significantly associated with two known high-risk factors for progression of breast cancer: the presence of cancer in lymph nodes and the stage and grade of the cancer.</p>
        <p>Among its functions, insulin can help make cells grow.</p>
        <p>The study involved 535 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who were followed for up to 10 years, Dr. Goodwin said at the closing of a meeting here of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.</p>
        <p>Many women in the study were obese, and obesity leads to insulin resistance, which can lead to high levels of insulin, Dr. Goodwin said.</p>
        <p>But she added that high insulin levels were found in some thin women and those of normal weight, and they had poorer outcomes. Researchers must now figure out why insulin levels are high.</p>
        <p>The insulin levels were measured in blood taken after the women had fasted for several hours. Such tests are more sensitive for insulin levels than blood taken after meals, said Dr. Goodwin, who urged other researchers to introduce fasting insulin tests in their studies.</p>
        <p>Dr. Larry Norton, a leading breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said, ''The finding is very important because it will open up new avenues of research, and I hope it will lead to a better understanding of prognosis and new approaches to therapy and prevention.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Norton added, ''The major exciting point is it helps us to better understand the relationship between cancer and the body.</p>
        <p>''Cancer is more complicated than the cancer cell, and we can lose sight of that if we just focus on the cancer cell,'' he continued. ''In this case, we see evidence that a hormone produced by normal cells can cause cancers to grow and lead to a worse prognosis.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Goodwin said she expected that her findings would be used more in a research setting than in everyday medical practice ''because we do not yet know how to use that prognostic information to improve'' survival.</p>
        <p>Although the finding is discouraging for women with high insulin levels, Dr. Goodwin sought in an interview to assure such women.</p>
        <p>''Just because someone has an eightfold increased risk of death, it does not necessarily mean they are going to die,'' Dr. Goodwin said. ''It means they are at greater risk for a bad outcome.''</p>
        <p>Of the women with the highest levels of insulin in the study, 70 percent were alive after seven years, she said.</p>
        <p>Of the women with the lowest insulin levels, about 95 percent were alive after seven years.</p>
        <p>''This is not the answer to breast cancer,'' Dr. Goodwin said, but information about insulin levels could be used to develop new treatment strategies to lower the risk for affected women.</p>
        <p>One research step would be to conduct a series of trials to determine whether more aggressive chemotherapy and interventions in patients' way of life, like exercise and weight loss, could improve survival among women with high insulin levels.</p>
        <p>The study focused on insulin, not diabetes, although some diabetics have increased insulin. Insulin is critical for controlling the blood levels of the sugar glucose.</p>
        <p>Diabetes can result from a lack of insulin, but it can also result when a body develops resistance to normal amounts of insulin, leaving more insulin in the body.</p>
        <p>Also, insulin plays an important role in cell growth. Cells have a specific area on their surface, known as a receptor, to which insulin attaches.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goodwin said her team at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto ''believes that insulin is acting on the surface of breast cancer cells and turning on the pathway'' to promote the growth of cancer cells.</p>
        <p>Earlier evidence has shown that insulin receptors in breast tissue differ from those elsewhere in the body, and laboratory studies have suggested that insulin can cause breast cells to grow and undergo transformation to cancerous cells, Dr. Goodwin said.</p>
        <p>Another line of research would be to develop novel drugs to impede insulin's effect on breast cells. That is a formidable challenge because insulin is needed to maintain normal blood sugar.</p>
        <p>But drugs might be developed to block insulin receptor sites the way tamoxifen blocks receptor sites for the hormone estrogen.</p>
        <p>A second way would be to disrupt insulin's metabolic actions within breast cells after insulin attaches to the receptor. A third way would be to learn why the insulin levels are high and modify them.</p>
