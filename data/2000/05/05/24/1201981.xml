        <p>The three judges held their wineglasses to the light, swirled the contents around and took sips, letting the fluid rest lightly on their palates. It was a blind tasting and they were judging on the basis of clarity, bouquet and taste, but it turned out that vintage was important, too.</p>
        <p>When the judges' tallies were in, the winner was announced: Independence Village, a 40-unit housing development for the elderly in Montville, Conn., had the best water in rural America.</p>
        <p>George Harakaly, a regional water official who accepted the award on behalf of the housing development, attributed the victory to proper aging.</p>
        <p>The water, he said, was 5,000 years old -- ''reached 350 feet deep with a six-inch pipe that had to drill through rock.''</p>
        <p>Independence Village won the competition today in a drinking water taste contest conducted by the National Rural Drinking Water Association. The association is meeting in Washington and lobbying for its cause -- bringing good water to the millions of people who live in towns too small to be served by big-city water companies and authorities.</p>
        <p>All the judges were government officials who could be useful to that cause.</p>
        <p>One was Robert J. Blanco, a water expert with the Environmental Protection Agency, who said he approached the task by emphasizing taste, clarity, sparkle and what the association officials referred to in mock seriousness as bouquet but he called minor fragrances.</p>
        <p>''Any minor fragrances,'' he said. ''Certain minor fragrances are fine, psychologically lifting.''</p>
        <p>In everyday consumption, even a faint whiff of chlorine can be good, he said, because it shows that the water has been treated.</p>
        <p>But if the water carries the odor of a petroleum-based product, ''you might want to quickly stop,'' he said, because that indicates a chemical called TCE. ''It's a degreasing agent,'' he said. ''Sometimes it gets into the ground water and next thing you know it's in the drinking water.''</p>
        <p>Of all the judges, Mr. Blanco seemed to have caught best the tone of the occasion. He lifted his wineglass high and stared through it toward the tall ceiling of the Senate Caucus Room. Then he put his nose deep inside the glass and inhaled deeply. Then he put on a baseball cap with H2 O on the front.</p>
        <p>Another judge, Carrie Apostolou, a staff member of the appropriations subcommittee that approves federal spending for rural water projects, said afterward: ''All the water was excellent. There wasn't a lot of difference between them.''</p>
        <p>Independence Village won over four other finalists, gleaned from competitors from 24 states. The runners-up, missing the grand prize by just the tiniest sparkle or hint of bouquet, were the Tuppers Plains Chester Water District in Reedsville, Ohio; the Coolfont Mountainside Association in Berkeley Springs, W. Va.; the City of St. Anthony, Idaho; and the Village of Butternut, Wis.</p>
        <p>The third judge was John P. Romano, a rural utilities administrator with the Department of Agriculture, who confided before the competition began that ''I know water politics better than water.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Romano said his agency provided $1.3 billion a year in low-interest loans and grants.</p>
        <p>In Montville, Carol Lathrop, who runs both the elderly housing development and the water supply system, said when asked the secret of her success, ''We're very careful to preserve the integrity of our water -- make sure there are no spills or toxic materials near the well.''</p>
        <p>Asked to describe her water, Ms. Lathrop said: ''How do you tell someone what water tastes like? I guess you can say it tends to be a little on the sweet side, not saccharine sweet but refreshing.''</p>
