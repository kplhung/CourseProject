        <p>The three top officials at a New Jersey prison and three aides have been demoted or suspended because of a string of bureaucratic blunders that led to the improper release of a  rapist in March.</p>
        <p>The state's corrections commissioner, Jack Terhune, ordered the  shake-up in recent days after his department's investigators found five violations of law and department policy had allowed the rapist, Raymond Alves, to go free before the end of his sentence, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Prison officials released Mr. Alves  from the Southern State Correctional Facility in rural Cumberland County  on March 9 without giving the 30 days' notice required by Megan's Law to the prosecutor's office in Bergen County, where Mr. Alves was convicted in 1976. William H. Schmidt, the Bergen County prosecutor, said he would have used that time to seek Mr. Alves's detention under a provision of the law allowing  involuntary civil commitment of convicted sex offenders who are considered dangerous sexual predators.</p>
        <p>The release embarrassed state officials and led to a nationwide search for Mr. Alves, who was caught on March 21 after taking an evening rush-hour train from Newark to the rural hamlet of Annandale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alves is being held without bail pending confidential court hearings on whether he must be confined to a treatment center.</p>
        <p>The mistakes that led to his freedom ranged from miscalculation of his release date, which led to his release on March 9 instead of June 11, to the failure of the prison's final-review committee to detect lower-level administrative errors and to make a written recommendation on whether to free Mr. Alves. The report by Mr. Terhune's staff seemed to place ultimate blame on the prison's administrator, Michael McKeen.</p>
        <p>The report, released Monday by the State Senate's Judiciary Committee, which is conducting its own inquiry, said the numerous errors detected made it ''clearly evident'' that Mr. McKeen was ''remiss in his administrative responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Terhune has demoted Mr. McKeen to assistant superintendent, two levels beneath an administrator, and reassigned him to a youth correction center, a department spokesman, Chris Carden, said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Terhune has demoted the prison's second-ranking official, Karen Balicki, the associate administrator, to an assistant superintendent's post at another prison. He has demoted Southern State's third-ranking officer, assistant superintendent Gary Schneider, to lieutenant at another prison and is now seeking his dismissal, Mr. Carden said.</p>
        <p>The corrections commissioner is also seeking dismissal of one of Ms. Balicki's subordinates, Darlene Archie, a prison classification officer; a 45-day suspension for one of Ms. Archie's aides, Susan Hunter; and a 10-day suspension for Nicholas Melfi, an executive assistant, Mr. Carden said.</p>
