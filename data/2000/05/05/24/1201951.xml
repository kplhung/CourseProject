        <p>Give the National Rifle Association credit for audacity. At its annual convention last weekend it announced plans to build a theme restaurant in Times Square, along the lines of the World Wrestling Federation's new Times Square restaurant and, farther uptown, Planet Hollywood. The N.R.A. also plans an electronic-game arcade and gift store called NRA Sports Blast, which it described as an ''exciting total shooting sports and sporting goods experience.'' The gift store, a spokesman said, would not sell guns or live ammunition.</p>
        <p>Well, we can all be grateful for that. But the notion of the N.R.A.'s setting up shop in Times Square is unsettling. The reason is not that this newspaper, which has long opposed the N.R.A.'s policies, happens to be in the same neighborhood -- a mere two blocks, actually, from the $275-per-square-foot space the N.R.A. has its eyes on. The main reason is that the cleanup of Times Square over the last few years has made it a favorite destination for parents and children. The last thing these kids need is somebody trying to disguise the fact that guns represent a tremendous public health threat, especially for children and especially in urban areas like New York.</p>

        <p>Well, we can all be grateful for that. But the notion of the N.R.A.'s setting up shop in Times Square is unsettling. The reason is not that this newspaper, which has long opposed the N.R.A.'s policies, happens to be in the same neighborhood -- a mere two blocks, actually, from the $275-per-square-foot space the N.R.A. has its eyes on. The main reason is that the cleanup of Times Square over the last few years has made it a favorite destination for parents and children. The last thing these kids need is somebody trying to disguise the fact that guns represent a tremendous public health threat, especially for children and especially in urban areas like New York.</p>
        <p>The New York politicians who have commented on the N.R.A. invasion don't like the idea, in part because they resent the N.R.A.'s efforts to block sensible gun control legislation whose main purpose is to keep guns away from the wrong people, including children. Senator Charles Schumer said he hoped landlords would not rent to the N.R.A. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said he doubted the N.R.A. could survive in a neighborhood where ground-floor rents can top $7 million a year.</p>
        <p>That seemed another way of saying he did not think the N.R.A. was peddling a very attractive product.</p>
