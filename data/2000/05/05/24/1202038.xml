        <p>For all the countless, impassioned speeches Jim Florio has delivered in his quest for the Democratic nomination for New Jersey's United States Senate seat, the most telling two words in his campaign are the ones Mr. Florio has refused to utter: ''I'm sorry.''</p>
        <p>Both admirers and critics say it is hardly surprising that Mr. Florio is standing by the single act that has most defined his political career: the $2.8 billion tax increase he pushed through the State Legislature two months after becoming governor.</p>
        <p>The tax rise, enacted in 1990, set off a tirade by angry voters.</p>
        <p>Democrats were swept from offices across the state and lost control of both houses of the Legislature. United States Senator Bill Bradley, who had nothing to do with the plan, was nearly toppled simply because he hesitated for months before disavowing Mr. Florio's tax package. In 1993, Mr. Florio was cast into exile by a thin margin, becoming the only governor in New Jersey's modern history to be denied a second term.</p>
        <p>The tax increase also defines the crucial question about Mr. Florio's record as governor. Was he a principled leader willing to take unpopular stands for worthy causes or an arrogant blunderer whose tin ear left him out of touch with the state he now wants to represent in the Senate?</p>
        <p>In his campaign against Jon S. Corzine, the former chairman of Goldman, Sachs, leading up to the June 6 Democratic primary, Mr. Florio has gone beyond merely defending his decision to raise taxes.</p>
        <p>Conceding only that he should have better explained to voters that a court-ordered increase in school financing made the tax increase necessary, Mr. Florio defiantly describes it as a courageous action to protect the core values of the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>''It's fine for Republicans to walk away from a commitment to finance education for all of our children, to comply with a court order that said there's something wrong with a child getting the quality of education that depends upon the accident of what town they live in,'' Mr. Florio said. ''Those kind of know-nothing views about not standing up for our children don't belong in our party. They belong in the other party.''</p>
        <p>A former Navy boxer from Camden County who has spent almost all his working life in politics and has practiced law since leaving office, Mr. Florio, 62, has been emphasizing health care, Social Security and education in his campaign, while dismissing Mr. Corzine as a rich neophyte trying to buy his way into the Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio was leading in the polls earlier this year, but that lead has shifted in the last month, as the better-financed Mr. Corzine has begun running television ads reminding voters of Mr. Florio's tax increase.</p>
        <p>Beyond its disastrous political fallout, the tax increase raises two critical questions about Mr. Florio: Was it smart policy and what kind of governor was he anyway?</p>
        <p>By casting the tax increase as a matter of principle, Mr. Florio hopes to remind voters of his record of activism as governor and congressman.</p>
        <p>Those same principles, Mr. Florio says, spurred him to take on the National Rifle Association by passing the nation's first, and strongest, assault weapons ban. Mr. Florio also defeated an attempt by Republican legislators to overturn the ban, and was later granted the John F. Kennedy Profiles in Courage Award for his efforts.</p>
        <p>As governor, Mr. Florio tightened New Jersey's environmental laws, curbing the ocean dumping that had dirtied the state's beaches and created an office of environmental prosecutor to go after polluters.</p>
        <p>Before suburban sprawl became a major statewide issue, Mr. Florio used the governor's office to restrict development, by signing an executive order requiring that all new construction had to conform with the state development plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio also riled the auto insurance companies by eliminating the $220 surcharge state drivers paid for the risk pool to cover bad drivers, and forcing the companies to assume more of that cost.</p>
        <p>Executives at Allstate Insurance were so upset by that move, and at Mr. Florio's other policies, that the company threatened to pull out of the New Jersey market. Mr. Florio responded by saying that Allstate was trying to frighten the state into granting the company a huge rate increase, and insisted that if it wanted to pull out of auto insurance in New Jersey, it would be required to pull out of all insurance in New Jersey. Allstate backed down.</p>
        <p>''Jim Florio wasn't always effective at communicating with the public,'' said Carl Van Horn, who was Mr. Florio's chief public policy adviser. ''But he was a problem solver, someone who wasn't afraid to tackle big issues, even if that meant making powerful enemies.''</p>
        <p>But the paradox of Jim Florio is that his style of leadership has often angered the very people he proposed to help. Even supporters say his single-mindedness and self-assurance can make him seem like the political world's version of castor oil -- his policies may be good for you, but they sure leave a bitter taste.</p>
        <p>Members of the state's powerful teachers' union, who should have been pleased by Governor Florio's increase in school financing, accused him of weakening their pension system by shifting the obligation for employer contributions from the state to the local districts. His overhaul of the state's welfare system helped shrink the size of the state's dole, but also angered many Democrats because it froze benefits for recipients who became pregnant while on public assistance.</p>
        <p>Other state employees also have disturbing memories of Mr. Florio's term as governor. At a recent A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention in Atlantic City, Mr. Florio reminded labor leaders of his efforts in Congress to promote workers' rights and the many picket lines he had walked with them. He singled out more than a dozen union officials in the room by name. But members of the Communications Workers of America, which represents state employees, still remember Mr. Florio's trying to back out of a contract they had agreed to in 1991.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, when Mr. Florio met with the union's political action committee this year, seeking an endorsement for his Senate run, Mr. Florio was anything but contrite, labor leaders say.</p>
        <p>''He should have just come to us and said, 'Look, I know we've had our problems, but I'm a good labor guy, so let's get on with the future,' '' said Jim Marketti, president of C.W.A.  Local 1032. ''But instead, he was all defensive, and trying to rewrite history. So a lot of what he said just seemed to ring hollow to our members.''</p>
        <p>The union did not endorse either candidate in the primary.</p>
        <p>Even before the fallout from the tax increase, some of Mr. Florio's harshest critics were other New Jersey Democrats.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Florio took office as governor, his advisers persuaded him to push for the tax increase early, so voters would have time to forget before re-election time rolled around. Some Democrats, both in New Jersey and outside the state, agreed with the wisdom of his move. The Star-Ledger compared the ambitious agenda of Mr. Florio's first 100 days in office to Franklin D. Roosevelt's. Mario M. Cuomo, who was then governor of New York, praised Mr. Florio's courage and said in June 1990 that he should be considered presidential material.</p>
        <p>But all around New Jersey, Democratic legislators, county freeholders and city council members began hearing complaints that Mr. Florio's actions were arrogant, that he broke a pledge not to raise taxes and that he was pushing ahead without convincing the public that a tax increase was unavoidable.</p>
        <p>In the end, voter anger, fueled by talk radio and hostile groups like the N.R.A., were too much. In 1993, he lost to Christine Todd Whitman by 26,000 votes, one of the slimmest margins in state history. Republicans in the Legislature declined a challenge to simply repeal the Florio taxes, but Mrs. Whitman later made good on her pledge to cut income-tax rates by 30 percent.</p>
        <p>Despite the loss, some political analysts say his record as governor was commendable.</p>
        <p>''There's only one worst recession since the Great Depression and he had the bad fortune to assume office just when its effects were being felt,'' said James Hughes, a professor of political science at Rutgers University. ''He didn't have much choice but to increase taxes, and once he did, he lost the Legislature and had to be creative in order to carry out any agenda.''</p>
        <p>Others, including Mr. Corzine, assert that Mr. Florio worsened the state's economic pain by raising too many taxes too high too fast.</p>
        <p>Many economists agree that Mr. Florio's policies made New Jersey a difficult and expensive place to conduct business. Irwin Kellner, an economist for Chase Manhattan and Manufacturer's Hanover Banks during Mr. Florio's term, said he recalled New Jersey business owners' complaining that they were overtaxed and overburdened by environmental and labor regulations.</p>
        <p>''Even during a recession, communities compete against each other,'' said Mr. Kellner, now a professor of economics at Hofstra University. ''The tax increases made things in New Jersey worse than neighboring states, and businesses stayed away.''</p>
        <p>Larry Sabato, a professor of political science at the University of Virginia, whose 1980 book, ''Goodbye to Good-Time Charlie,'' was a study of governors who lost re-election bids, said Mr. Florio was largely a product of his times. The two New Jersey governors who preceded Mr. Florio also broke their campaign promises not to raise taxes, but still won re-election. By 1993 however, the recession and the political partisanship of Washington left voters in a far less forgiving mood, Mr. Sabato said.</p>
        <p>''He was actually quite successful with the Legislature and he achieved a great deal as governor on the environment and gun control and education,'' Mr. Sabato said. ''But in a sense, he achieved too much. You can't achieve more than the public wants and expect to be re-elected. He tried to do so much, and it cost so much, that taxpayers said, 'Bye-bye, Jim.' ''</p>
        <p>Given the lingering resentment over the tax increase, many Democrats say that Mr. Florio's attempt to win political redemption without ever repenting shows that what was wrong with Mr. Florio as governor is what is wrong with Mr. Florio as Senate candidate.</p>
        <p>''He's a good person, but he's so intense,'' said Anthony Impreveduto, a Democratic legislator who voted for Mr. Florio's tax increase in 1990 and now supports Mr. Corzine. ''He's the kind of person who, if you see him at a dinner party and make small talk about your summer vacation, he wants to talk about ocean dumping.''</p>
        <p>To some, Mr. Florio's career is a lesson in how smart politics and smart policy are inseparable -- to the point that it is impossible to credit him for one without the other.</p>
        <p>Thomas H. Kean, the governor who preceded Mr. Florio, said he, too, was forced to raise taxes when  he assumed office and found an unexpected budget deficit.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kean said he held extensive public hearings to prepare voters for the unpleasant news, and when the bill passed, with bipartisan support, he signed it while literally holding his nose.</p>
        <p>''I didn't smile and hold up the bill when I signed it, and I didn't push it through the Legislature without bipartisan support,'' said Mr. Kean, a Republican. ''Jim Florio should be proud of the assault weapons ban. But his inexperience in his first year in office, and the failures it caused, made it a pretty difficult term the rest of the way.''</p>
        <p>So, given the lingering bitterness,  why not apologize now?</p>
        <p>Mr. Sabato suspects that the tax increase is such an integral part of Mr. Florio's legacy that he is wary of distancing himself from the issue.</p>
        <p>''He can live with the political failure of losing re-election,'' Mr. Sabato said. ''A lot of people have been crucified for doing what they think was the right thing. But if he backs away from the tax increase in any way, then history might view him as a policy failure as well, and that would take away from his reason for political being.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio is not nearly as philosophical in describing his motives.</p>
        <p>''The idea of, sort of, apologizing for funding kids' education is something I'm not comfortable with,'' Mr. Florio said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 27, 2000, Saturday  A front-page article on Wednesday about Jim Florio's record as governor of New Jersey referred incorrectly to the rarity of a defeat like the one he suffered in 1993. Mr. Florio was the second governor in the state's modern history, not the first, to lose a bid for a second term. Gov. William T. Cahill lost the 1973 Republican primary to Representative Charles W. Sandman Jr.</p>
