        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>MISSOURI DEMOCRAT QUITS RACE -- Battling breast cancer, Representative Pat Danner, Democrat of Missouri, has ended her bid for re-election to a fifth term. Her surprise departure, announced late Monday, makes her the eighth House Democrat to retire this year, compared with 24 Republicans who are leaving, and hangs still another question mark over the struggle for control of the House this year. Ms. Danner's son Steve, a former state representative, immediately said he would run in her place in the August primary. Ms. Danner, a 66-year-old moderate-to-conservative, disclosed in January that she was being treated for breast cancer but said that her prognosis was excellent. She won 71 percent of the vote in her re-election in 1998 and seemed headed for an easy victory this year in her Congressional district, the Sixth, which  Bill Clinton carried in 1992 and 1996. But Republican leaders said they believed that her withdrawal gave them a good shot at picking up a seat. ''This is a crushing setback for Democrats,'' Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said. His Democratic counterpart, Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, said that ''the Sixth District is Democratic territory.''</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>MICHIGAN RACE HEATS UP -- When it comes to cost, mean-spirited verbiage and manipulation by out-of-state interests, Michigan has never seen a race like the current one for the Senate. The incumbent freshman Republican, Spencer Abraham, and his Democratic challenger, Representative Debbie Stabenow, are on their way to spending a record $15 million on the contest. Senator Abraham has taken to calling Ms. Stabenow ''the queen of soft money.'' She says he is a ''tool of Washington's special interests. The contest, which could help decide control of the Senate next year, is so hot that even the latest poll has become an issue. Made public over the weekend by the EPIC/MRA polling organization of Lansing, it shows Ms. Stabenow taking a four-percentage-point lead after being down three points in April and up six in March. Mr. Abraham's take on that switch, whatever his earlier takes: the pollster, Edward V. Sarpolus, cannot be trusted because he once worked for some Democrats. Mr. Sarpolus's reply: Most pollsters have done some work for candidates, and the senator is being ''childish.''</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GORE LEADS IN HOLLYWOOD MONEY -- Entertainment industry donors, historically more Democratic than Republican, give Vice President Al Gore more campaign money than they give Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Through March 30 in the current election cycle, Mr. Gore collected $858,865 from executives and others employed by television, movie and music companies, while Mr. Bush brought in $661,877, according to the latest figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan study group in Washington. Over all, Mr. Bush has a 2-to-1 lead in fund-raising, $84 million to $36 million, not including federal matching funds. The entertainment industry is Mr. Gore's fifth-largest campaign contributor; it is No. 20 on the Bush list.</p>
