        <p>If ever a playwright was ahead of his time it was Euripides.

        <p>If ever a playwright was ahead of his time it was Euripides. While Aeschylus and Sophocles were winning prizes with tragedies full of philosophical jousting with Zeus and agonizing over the fates, Euripides was exploring what we would today call character development, and it is his concentration on the individual that makes his plays more accessible to present-day audiences.</p>
        <p>In ''Medea,'' which is being given a vibrant and lusty staging by Eve Adamson at the Jean Cocteau Repertory, Euripides takes a story that was old even when he wrote it in 430 B.C. -- a husband leaving his wife for a younger woman -- and examines the horrific extremes to which a scorned woman will go for revenge.</p>
        <p>It was Medea, after all, who helped Jason secure the Golden Fleece, who gave up her own promising career as a princess to marry him and bear his children, and now he is dumping her for the young daughter of King Creon. ''Jason was my whole life,'' Medea explains. It's a familiar refrain, even in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>Ms. Adamson, one of our most consistently excellent directors, focuses on the realism inherent in Euripides' play and builds it into a chilling domestic melodrama with catastrophic results, a sort of ''Fatal Attraction'' for fifth-century B.C. Corinth. Moving the action around an empty bed in Robert Klingelhoefer's spare, surreal set, Ms. Adamson emphasizes the motivational themes of passion and betrayal. Even the horror-movie elements in ''Medea'' (that flesh-eating dress, for example) are turned to a high theatrical effect that is underscored by Ellen Mandel's eerie original music.</p>
        <p>In Elise Stone, one of the Cocteau's most consistently fine actors, Ms. Adamson has an earthy Medea capable of bridging the centuries to turn the Greek tragedy into a contemporary one.</p>
        <p>Fiery, sexy and sultry, Ms. Stone commands the stage from her first entrance with her long black hair flowing like a Medusa and her dress slit up to her thighs. Ms. Stone uses a remarkable vocal range in breathing life into a mythological character that is all too human: from a pleading and seductive tone in her manipulation of Creon and Aegeus she turns to hot-tempered fury in her confrontation with Jason, then finally expounds her murderous plans for revenge in an otherworldly voice that sounds like the demon in ''The Exorcist.''</p>
        <p>As Jason, Jolie Garrett delivers a credible performance of a man who is blind to anything but his own desire, and the Cocteau veterans Craig Smith and Harris Berlinsky offer fine turns as Creon and Aegeus, the kings respectively of Corinth and Athens. A three-woman chorus, which emerges from the audience to plead with Medea, deliver their warnings earnestly and in unison.</p>
        <p>The only distractions among the cast are in one or two readings that fall into the monotonous declamatory style that some think is endemic to Greek tragedies. But Ms. Adamson knows better, and she and Ms. Stone turn this ''Medea'' into a very modern play.</p>
        <p>MEDEA  By Euripides; translated by Philip Vellacott; directed by Eve Adamson; sets by Robert Klingelhoefer; costumes by Susan Soetart; lighting by Ms. Adamson and Harold A. Mulanix; music composed by Ellen Mandel; production manager, Jonathan R. Polgar; stage manager, Samone Weissman. Presented by the Jean Cocteau Repertory, David Fuller, producing artistic director. At the Bouwerie Lane Theater, 330 Bowery, at Bond Street, East Village.</p>
        <p>WITH: Elise Stone (Medea), Jolie Garrett (Jason), Craig Smith (Creon), Harris Berlinsky (Aegeus) and Angela Madden (Nurse).</p>
