        <p>The Carver Bancorp, the largest black-run bank in the country, announced late yesterday that it had lost more than $1 million in the last year, and that it had reshuffled its board.</p>
        <p>Four board members resigned, including David N. Dinkins, the former mayor, and David R. Jones, the bank's chairman and president of the Community Service Society, a major city charity.</p>
        <p>Two businessmen with experience at large corporations are joining the board: Robert Holland, a former president of Ben &amp; Jerry's, who is now chief executive of Workplace Integrators, a furniture dealership; and Strauss Zelnick, who is now the chief executive of B.M.G. Entertainment.</p>
        <p>The new chairman of Carver is Frederick O. Terrell, the chief executive of Provender Capital, who became a director in January after his firm invested in the bank.</p>
        <p>Carver, which lost almost $6 million before taxes in the 1999 fiscal year, had reported improved financial results this year. But it said yesterday that more than $400,000 of the $2 million in profits it reported as of year-end were the result of an ''incorrect accounting entry.''</p>
        <p>Combined with a $2.6 million loss in the three months ended March, Carver reported a loss for the 2000 fiscal year of slightly more than $1 million.</p>
