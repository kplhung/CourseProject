        <p>The government of President Alberto K. Fujimori said today that a runoff presidential election would be held on Sunday as scheduled despite nationwide protests and calls from Washington and other allies that it be postponed to ensure a clean ballot count.</p>
        <p>The decision appeared to increase the possibility of economic sanctions against Peru after it ignored the recommendations of the Clinton administration, the Organization of American States and several European and Latin American governments.</p>
        <p>Within minutes of the announcement, violent clashes that had left several people injured earlier in the day resumed, with protesters setting fire to a balcony of the presidential palace and hurling stones at the building and at the police, who responded with tear gas.</p>
        <p>The electoral crisis had been gathering momentum since Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate, dropped out of the race last Thursday, saying he would not compete in a fraudulent election. He had said he would rejoin the contest only if it were postponed by several weeks, with guarantees for a free vote.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing today's decision, Mr. Toledo said, ''This will bring Peru enormous instability, with totally unpredictable political and economic consequences.''</p>
        <p>During intense negotiations all week, United States and Latin American diplomats had urged Peruvian officials to delay the election so a computer system used to count votes could be overhauled and rechecked by independent auditors.</p>
        <p>A brief announcement that the National Elections Commission had voted, 3 to 2, to go forward with the runoff was met with shock by international observers who had become increasingly hopeful that President Fujimori had decided to give in to international pressure.</p>
        <p>''We are quite disappointed,'' said  Eduardo Stein, head of an election observer team for the Organization of American States, ''because other options were being intensively considered.'' He added, ''It's been a terrible week.''</p>
        <p>A senior United States Embassy official said: ''The U.S. government deeply regrets this outcome. Even a relatively brief delay would have put the Organization of American States in a position to speak to the integrity of the election results.''</p>
        <p>President Fujimori had appeared to be going back and forth on the election scheduling during the past three days, but Western diplomats said that mounting protests had perhaps strengthened the hand of hard-liners in the government.</p>
        <p>Just Wednesday night, Mr. Fujimori had said in an interview in the government palace: ''The possibility for an adjustment of the election date exists. We are in a fluctuating situation.'' It was one of several signs that Mr. Fujimori and his aides were satisfied that they could win the election at a later date and avert a crisis in its foreign relations.</p>
        <p>''It was a close call,'' Francisco Tudela, Mr. Fujimori's vice presidential running mate, said of the decision in an interview tonight. The electoral commission ''could not escape the Constitution and the elections law.'' Under the law, he said, the election could not be held more than 30 days after results of the first-round presidential vote were announced.</p>
        <p>A wave of strikes and street demonstrations that followed Mr. Toledo's withdrawal from the race last week grew increasingly violent today.</p>
        <p>A small group of protesters attacked the offices of the National Elections Commission, the highest government body that supervises the elections, and broke windows and damaged a door with rocks, pipes and at least one gasoline bomb. Scores of people were arrested in the northern jungle city of Iquitos for blocking roads, and the police used tear gas to clear protesters gathering in front of the government palace here in the capital.</p>
        <p>Truck drivers and teachers staged a strike in the Andean city of Cuzco, a Toledo stronghold. Bands of university students in Lima and Arequipa repeatedly attacked riot police officers with stones, and the police counterattacked with tear gas through much of the day.</p>
        <p>A growing number of influential businessmen had warned that holding the uncontested election on Sunday could mean years of economic sanctions and tensions with Washington that could impede investment and growth. Their arguments were strengthened through the week as Peruvian bond and stock prices dropped sharply and foreign financial institutions issued risk warnings that threatened to increase interest rates.</p>
        <p>In recent days, the government's policies on the campaign and political process have been inconsistent. Several television stations allied with the government had begun showing Toledo commercials and coverage of his rallies, while tabloid newspapers thought to be directed by Mr. Fujimori's intelligence service had softened their negative coverage of Mr. Toledo's personal life.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, on Wednesday night, three unidentified men broke into the offices of an opposition journalist who was said to hold incriminating videotapes of Vladimiro Montesinos, Mr. Fujimori's intelligence chief, meeting with election officials. The journalist, Fabian Salazar, said the burglars tied him up and tortured him as they demanded that he reveal the sources within the intelligence service who gave him copies of the tapes, which apparently were made by Mr. Montesinos himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salazar said the intruders cut his left wrist to the bone with a saw during their questioning. He was hospitalized, and his videotapes, archives and computer disks were stolen. Human rights activists said Mr. Salazar's descriptions of his ordeal, which were verified by doctors, may represent the worst example of torture in Peru in at least two years.</p>
