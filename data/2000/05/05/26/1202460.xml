        <p>Judging by the nearly four billion solicitations that flooded American mailboxes last year, the credit card business would seem to be one of the most viciously competitive. In how many industries does one business disparage another by name in national television advertisements, as Visa has done with its long-running ''they don't take American Express'' campaign?</p>
        <p>Even so, the federal government strenuously disagrees that consumers have as much choice as they need: 19 months ago the Justice Department sued MasterCard and Visa, accusing them of violating antitrust laws. In recent weeks, debate over this issue has sharply intensified as the suit approaches trial.</p>
        <p>Today, in a Congressional hearing unusual in its timing so close to judicial proceedings, the largely behind-the-scenes dueling between two pairs of industry rivals -- American Express and Discover espousing the government's side against the defendants, Visa and MasterCard -- erupted before a Senate subcommittee.</p>
        <p>Visa and MasterCard, which are associations whose member banks account for about 75 percent of purchase volume, ''have a great deal to answer for,'' Harvey Golub, the American Express chairman, contended, complaining, among other things, that their rules bar banks that issue either Visa or MasterCard from offering American Express cards as well.</p>
        <p>''They operate a closed, self-serving, self-perpetuating system,'' Mr. Golub asserted. ''Their operation of this system has harmed consumers, limited banks' ability to conduct their business, gouged merchants in the debit market and stifled innovation.'' Debit cards are the subject of a separate class-action suit brought by Wal-Mart Stores and other retailers.</p>
        <p>MasterCard's chief counsel, Noah J. Hanft, responded: ''If American Express gets its way, neither competition nor the consumer wins'' because it would undermine a system in which near-universal acceptance and guaranteed payment to merchants has brought spectacular growth in credit card popularity. The government's suit, he added, ''is a solution searching for a problem and, if successful, will create a problem where none exists today.''</p>
        <p>The trial, scheduled to begin on June 7 in New York, is expected to take up to four months, with perhaps years of appeal to follow. Judge Barbara S. Jones will hear the case without a jury.</p>
        <p>The legal battle in credit cards comes at a time of swirling industry change. Advances in technology, consolidation into fewer large hands and shifting allegiances are already at work to make the ultimate effect of any legal outcome impossible to predict.</p>
        <p>But consumers appear to have a big stake, perhaps gaining an even greater choice of products and better terms, although how much better off, if at all, they might become is a matter of fierce dispute as the parties prepare to square off before Judge Jones.</p>
        <p>After more than a year of deposition and other pretrial fact-finding, Visa has started a vigorous effort to press its view that the case is little more than a clash of commercial titans in which American Express, having blundered in the market, has persuaded the government to help it regain a competitive edge.</p>
        <p>Among other moves, Visa has helped create a credit card educational group and circulated records of political donations by its rival and the fact that American Express has hired Robert H. Bork, a former federal judge, to lobby on credit cards.</p>
        <p>Responding in a memorandum to employees this week, Mr. Golub said: ''Rather than focusing on the legal issues, Visa has undertaken a campaign aimed at discrediting the government's case and indirectly impugning the motives of the Justice Department. The thrust of this campaign has nothing to do with the merits of the charges against Visa, but with the false and irrelevant claim that American Express is somehow 'behind' the case.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department's suit specifies two main ways in which it contends that the associations stifle competition in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. One is the practice of so-called dual governance under which Visa and MasterCard, which operate the infrastructure for thousands of member banks that are the actual issuers of cards, place representatives on each other's committees and allow a bank with a representative on, say, Visa's board to have a big portfolio of MasterCard accounts.</p>
        <p>In an echo of the Microsoft case, which also involved company rivals urging the government on, the government argues that this relationship discourages innovation that might occur if the two groups operated totally independently.</p>
        <p>The government's second target is the associations' exclusivity rule, which prohibits any Visa or MasterCard banks from also offering cards regarded as competitive. American Express cards and Discover Card, which is owned by a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, are the main alternatives.</p>
        <p>Philip J. Purcell, Morgan Stanley's chairman, told the Senate panel, headed by Robert F. Bennett, a Utah Republican, that consumers could save $5 billion a year if Discover, which he said charges merchants 30 percent lower fees than Visa and MasterCard, was not hamstrung by their anticompetitive practices.</p>
        <p>The associations respond by pointing to what they see as intense competition among member banks themselves, and by arguing that a restructuring of the industry would tilt the playing field in favor of competitors like American Express that both issue cards and process transactions. Consumers, they contend, would be harmed by the undermining of a popular and efficiently delivered product.</p>
        <p>''Visa has spent billions of dollars to promote its brand and to create a state-of-the art computer and telecommunications system that enables the use of Visa cards worldwide,'' Paul Allen, its general counsel, said today. ''At the same time, the mailboxes of consumers have overflowed with competing Visa and MasterCard solicitations. In light of this history, one might have expected that'' the Justice Department, ''rather than filing a lawsuit against Visa, would have commended Visa for its contributions to consumer welfare, competitive vitality and innovation.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, according to Anita L. Boomstein, an antitrust specialist at the law firm of Hughes Hubbard &amp; Reed in New York, ''the government is going to have a difficult time proving its case,'' stifled innovation being a more difficult argument than, say, the assertion that costs to consumers have been artificially raised.</p>
