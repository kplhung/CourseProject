        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki has vetoed a bill that would have made New York the first state to require that cigarettes meet fire-safety standards. He said that such a requirement might encourage bootlegging, and urged the Legislature to send him an amended version of the bill that dealt with his concerns.</p>
        <p>The governor vetoed the bill late Wednesday night and announced his action today, surprising legislators in both parties. The veto prompted Democrats and anti-smoking groups to accuse the governor of protecting the tobacco industry.</p>
        <p>Backers of the measure had hailed it as a breakthrough that would prevent hundreds of accidental fires and dozens of deaths each year. They said it could prod Congress to adopt national fire-safety rules, which have been considered several times since the 1980's, when tobacco companies first test-marketed less-flammable cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said that he agreed with the bill's goal of requiring that  all cigarettes sold in New York starting in late 2002 would have to stop burning when they are not puffed for a time. ''The principle of New York taking the lead to make sure we have fire-safe cigarettes, I wholeheartedly support,'' the governor said today at a news conference.</p>
        <p>But he said that for him to sign a bill achieving that goal, the Legislature needed to make a number of changes in the legislation in the three weeks remaining in this year's legislative session. ''I am hopeful that they can sit down with our staff, work out these details, and send the bill back with these changes and I will sign it into law,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The governor and his aides said that less-flammable cigarettes might not be welcomed by consumers, creating an incentive for bootlegging, the importation from other states of cigarettes that did not meet New York's standards. That would deprive the state of cigarette tax revenue as well as frustrate the law. One of the changes in the bill the governor sought would stiffen the penalties for bootlegging.</p>
        <p>But supporters of the bill brushed aside the governor's objections as disingenuous or trivial.</p>
        <p>''I think this was the governor desperately searching for an excuse to veto,'' said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, the Manhattan Democrat who was the bill's sponsor in his house. ''This was all about the governor protecting big tobacco, about big tobacco money to Republicans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grannis said he would ask the Assembly to override the veto, an idea that the Democratic majority will discuss next week. Senate officials said the Republican majority in that chamber almost certainly would not override the veto of a Republican governor.</p>
        <p>Tobacco companies lobbied against the bill, asserting that state-by-state fire-safety standards would be a burden for them. ''We're supportive of a federal standard, and really believe that that is the way to promulgate regulations and standards on fire safety,'' said Mike Pfeil, vice president for communications of Philip Morris U.S.A.</p>
        <p>Anti-tobacco groups say the industry's real concern is that less-flammable cigarettes would cut down sales, because a smoker who walks away from a lit cigarette for a time would find a stub that could be re-lighted, rather than a pile of ash.</p>
        <p>Until recently, the tobacco industry was one of the most powerful forces in Albany, doling out large  campaign contributions and employing a phalanx of prominent lobbyists. But for much of the last year, New York lawmakers, embarrassed by the release of internal tobacco company documents, have been eager to show that they can be tough on the industry.</p>
        <p>Those documents showed that the chief New York lobbyist for Philip Morris had treated more than 100 state officials, including members of the Legislature, to expensive dinners, theater tickets and other gifts, but had failed to report those expenses to the state's lobbying commission, as required by law. It was also revealed that Philip Morris helped pay for Mr. Pataki's trips to Hungary in 1995 and 1996 -- which both the company and the sponsor of the trips, a Hungarian-American trade group -- at first denied.</p>
        <p>The revelations helped weaken the industry's legislative clout and thus pave the way for a 55-cent-a-pack increase in the state's cigarette tax, to $1.11, the highest in the country; the adoption of new lobbying rules, and the passage of the safety bill.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, the governor's handed a major victory to the tobacco companies,'' said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group.</p>
        <p>Senator Frank Padavan of Queens, the Senate sponsor of the fire-safety bill, predicted that another bill would be passed and signed this year. ''I'm disappointed in the veto, but we are preparing legislation that will respond to the issues raised by the governor, many of which we had agreed upon before his veto, anyway,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grannis and aides to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the Assembly had no immediate objections to the governor's conditions.</p>
        <p>Both houses have already agreed to some of the changes Mr. Pataki requested, including fines for retailers who sell cigarettes that fail to meet the standards, and giving the tobacco companies six months after the rules are published to comply with them, rather than 30 days, which the vetoed bill provided.</p>
        <p>Both the Assembly and the Senate unanimously passed the bill, which was supported by consumer groups, health groups like the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association, firefighters' groups, and anti-tobacco organizations, more than a month ago. But until today, the governor and his aides repeatedly refused to say what he thought of the bill, or even of its basic goal.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you how disappointed we are in the governor,'' said Gerald J. Day, vice chairman of the Firemen's Association of the State of New York. ''Why did he wait until the last minute?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki demanded new penalties for bootlegging, and a ban on Internet sales of cigarettes for shipment to customers in New York. Internet sales evade payment of the state's tobacco taxes, could circumvent flammability rules, and can enable minors to buy cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Legislators in both parties said a bootlegging crackdown was a laudable idea, but had nothing to do with fire safety, and that in any case, there are two years to address that issue.</p>
        <p>But James McGuire, the governor's counsel, said bootlegging would soar if fire-safe cigarettes did not win smokers over. ''If consumers don't like them and they have ready access to the ones they do like, that's what's going to drive the market,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Anti-tobacco advocates counter that if there is a bootlegging problem, it has to do with attempts to circumvent the tobacco tax. And they note that when Mr. Pataki approved the 55-cent increase in December, he did not first insist on anti-bootlegging measures.</p>
        <p>Tobacco companies are already selling some cigarettes that stop burning on their own, under some of the less-popular brand names, like More, Merit, Virginia Slims, Capri Light and Eve Lights. Some use paper that is thick enough in places to stop burning. Others have altered the chemical composition of the paper.</p>
