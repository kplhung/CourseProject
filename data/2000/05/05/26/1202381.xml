        <p>SPEAKING at a symposium held at U.C.L.A. in January, the historian Anthony Vidler announced, ''All architecture is the result of panic.'' Panic has broken out with particularly vivid style in ''The Triumph of the Baroque,'' now on view at the National Gallery of Art. A survey of European architecture from 1600 to 1750, the show reveals that buildings, like people, can be overtaken by mass hysteria. For a century and a half, European walls, doors, roofs, windows and entire cities were contorted into quivering, writhing shapes.</p>
        <p>Organized by Henry A. Millon of the National Gallery along with Guy Cogeval, Paolo Viti and Marie-Paule Vial, the show documents the histrionics of Baroque architecture with about 100 artifacts, including antique wooden models and period paintings of buildings, gardens and urban vistas. Besides representing a style, the show explores a state of mind. Simultaneously embodying fight and flight, Baroque buildings look eager to escape the very reality they wish to dominate.</p>
        <p>''The Triumph of the Baroque'' can be seen as a sequel to the National Gallery's 1994 exhibition on Renaissance architecture, which also featured large wooden models as its star attractions. In Chapter 1 the models resembled Trojan horses: as expressions of humanism, Renaissance churches and palaces subverted the authority of the feudal institutions they were commissioned to glorify. In Chapter 2 the subversion grows more complex.</p>
        <p>Baroque architecture was a theatrical art. Here's how history set the stage: by 1600 all the instruments that would eventually topple absolute authority came into play, but absolutism concentrated ever greater power unto itself. Martin Luther's tracts against the church, published in 1520, were best sellers. They were significant not only because of their content, but because they demonstrated the power of the press as well. Ideas could now be easily circulated. In 1600 Descartes proposed his solution to existence, a philosophical formula that predicated reality on the capacity to doubt. Oh, and by the way, the Earth was no longer the center of the universe.</p>
        <p>The word baroque, originally applied to architecture in a pejorative sense, means irregular or misshapen. The show invites us to watch absolutism become literally bent out of shape. The Counter-Reformation granted people the right to question dogma, provided they ultimately submitted to the church. The Baroque style gave architects liberty to pursue infinite formal variations, provided that they ultimately submitted to Classicism. ''The Triumph of the Baroque'' offers a broad sampling of the results.</p>
        <p>The show is organized thematically. Designs from Italy, Germany, France, Britain, Russia and the Netherlands are grouped into sections on ecclesiastical, royal, military and commercial buildings. Besides emphasizing the international reach of the Baroque, this arrangement conveys the extent to which feudal institutions had evolved toward the modern corporate culture. Call it Baroque Inc.: travel specialists for the rich and holy, with an array of services provided by church and state.</p>
        <p>The show starts (like Anita Ekberg) with a plunge into the Trevi Fountain in Rome, a stellar tourist attraction that introduces two themes coursing throughout the show: theatricality and psychology. A precisely detailed wood-and-plaster model highlights the fountain's theatrical dimension, for it depicts the palace facade, sans palace, designed by Nicola Salvi for the Trevi's magnificent sculptural tableau.</p>
        <p>Since the model does not include water, visitors will have to imagine the Trevi's psychological dimension, or read Eleanor Clark's 1950 book ''Rome and a Villa.'' Clark's chapter on Rome's fountains may well be the finest depiction of the Baroque's emotional atmosphere ever written. ''You walk close to your dreams,'' she begins. ''In another minute, people in the crowd will all be naked, or will have fish tails or horses' behinds, like the characters in the fountains. . . . This is the vocabulary of our sleep, and the key image is always water.''</p>
        <p>The fountains are pieces of urban infrastructure as well as incentives to free association. Fusions of art and technology, they bring the rational and the irrational together at the center of public space. Bernini's Four Rivers fountain in the Piazza Navona, also represented by models and paintings, shows that these waterworks were political emanations as well. The fountain advertised the relocation of the local water supply to the pope's family palace.</p>
        <p>It is bizarre to move from this Mediterranean atmosphere toward the gilded dome resembling Chinese bells that crowns St. Isaac's Cathedral in St. Petersburg, but models of Russian Baroque buildings are a highlight of this show. This is one of the first occasions in which the Russian Baroque has been presented in a European context. Mr. Millon says that Russian curators have been besieged in the last decade with requests for material on Constructivist design while models of Baroque buildings have gathered dust.</p>
        <p>A model of Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg is the most extraordinary of the Russian treasures. Designed from 1750 to 1756 by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, architect of the Winter Palace and other St. Petersburg landmarks, the complex is a cross-axial composition with a cathedral at the center, flanked by four smaller chapels. Rastrelli's palette of gold, celestial blue and white, and the repeating bays of his facades will put some viewers in mind of Balanchine's ''Ballet Imperial,'' with its star ballerina, soloists and precisely drilled corps.</p>
        <p>An enfilade of royal residences dominates the Baroque show's second-floor galleries. The great palace of Caserta, court of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, is the finest example of these.</p>
        <p>Designed by Luigi Vantivelli from 1756 to 1769, the project induces a dreamlike state without recourse to water. The gentle incline of Caserta's grand staircase, the use of indirect lighting, the twisted pattern of the coffering within the building's domes induce the sensation of suspended gravity. This is Piranesian space, awesome and relentless. In comparison Versailles resembles a poorly planned suburban mall.</p>
        <p>Gothic spires are for the soul, Renaissance domes for the mind, Baroque facades for the senses. But there is no telling where emotion, once aroused, will be directed. The most horrifying object in the show is a model of the Great Kremlin Palace. Designed for Catherine the Great by Vasily Ivanovich Bazhenov in 1769-70, this is a vast dominatrix of a building, encircled by stones that resemble the studs on a sadist's belt.</p>
        <p>Psychological manipulation has a tendency to backfire. How long would it take before people began to wonder what kind of sovereign would want to appear in public dressed like a Mistress of Pain? Or what kind of saint would want to recline in ecstasy on an altar, like Bernini's sculpture of St. Teresa? In time the Baroque emphasis on psychology would invite the public to question external authority in all its forms. It would accelerate the modernity it sought to retard.</p>
        <p>As Christian Norberg-Schulz remarks in the show's excellent catalog, the Baroque era was a time of choices. People could choose a different faith, a different occupation, or they could quit Europe altogether. It was, that is to say, a time of competition, an era that heralded the rise of the consumer and of the arts dedicated to persuading consumers to make a particular choice.</p>
        <p>With Baroque architecture, space itself becomes a consumer product. In a recent conversation Mr. Vidler observed that the distorted forms and urban scale of the Baroque register the anxiety that came with the collapse of the distinct boundaries that once surrounded cities. The erosion of medieval fortifications and the rise of new modes of transportation went far toward undermining the traditional sense of place. Baroque spectacle helped to compensate for the loss.</p>
        <p>Mr. Millon is correct to suggest that this show will hold special appeal for a generation now preoccupied with computer morphing. Scrolls; spiral columns; trompe l'oeil ceilings that extend physical architecture into the firmament of heavenly illusion; gilded wave crests; cornices folded and refolded to distraction; facades drawn out horizontally to the vanishing point; arches, saints and topiary endlessly repeated as if produced by a malfunctioning keyboard: such devices easily outstrip most of what I have seen on the monitor screens of today's design studios. And they should give pause to those who think that computer-generated, so-called blob architecture has no place in the old bricks-and-mortar world.</p>
        <p>The affinity between the Baroque age and our own, however, goes deeper than the formal complexity common to both. We, too, have a complicated relationship to power. In a sense it is the reverse of the predicament in which church and state found themselves in the 17th century. Modern consumer society is committed to a way of life that is constantly corroding authority and its traditional institutions.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is this more evident than in our museums, and in the increasing difficulty with which they seek to maintain a balance between scholarship and entertainment, connoisseurship and popularity. The Bilbao branch of the Guggenheim is merely the most prominent in a vast proliferation of museum buildings designed in part as pilgrimage destinations to lure tourist dollars. As such, they are part of the corporate monoculture that many artists want to resist.</p>
        <p>The Guggenheim's serpentine steel skin and the Piranesian Turbine Hall of the new Tate Modern in London are formally quite different, but both are innately Baroque in their appeal to the emotions and in their ambition to set culture apart from commerce. Yet they also stand for the increasing importance of culture in the emerging global economy.</p>
        <p>Still, I came away from this show convinced that we need more museums, larger museums, better-financed museums, particularly in the United States. The National Gallery show, sponsored by EduCap Inc., presents only one-fourth of an exhibition originally presented in Turin, Italy. I'm glad I didn't catch it there. The National Gallery's 1994 Renaissance show was truncated, too, and after seeing the complete edition at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice, I found the abbreviated version a thorough letdown.</p>
        <p>A Baroque show four times the size might prove daunting for many visitors. But then the point of this style was to overwhelm the viewer. How amazing it would be to feel overwhelmed by it in the nation's capital. The Baroque is everything Americans came here to escape. And where can we go to flee the Baroque contortions of our day?</p>
        <p>ARCHITECTURE REVIEW  Correction:  May 27, 2000, Saturday  Because of a production error, a picture in Weekend yesterday showing a model for Bernini's sculpture of St. Teresa, with an architecture review of ''The Triumph of the Baroque'' at the National Gallery of Art, was reproduced in mirror image. St. Teresa should have appeared at the right, with the winged figure at the left.</p>
        <p>The caption for the other picture with the continuation of the review carried an incorrect identification from the museum. The work shown was Rastrelli's model for Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg, not Rinaldi's model for the Cathedral of St. Isaac there.</p>
