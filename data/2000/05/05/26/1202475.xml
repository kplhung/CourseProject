        <p>Gov. George W. Bush may be a fun date, but he's not the kind of guy you want to settle down with. So says the chairwoman of the Texas Democratic Party, Molly Beth Malcolm, one of more than 70 Democratic officials from 34 states who met here today with Vice President Al Gore and his senior campaign staff.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore has been lagging Mr. Bush in the public opinion polls, the meeting was not an emergency session but a long-planned chance for the campaign to coordinate with its state emissaries. Many left the impression that they were not worried about an election more than five months away, although they were trying to prepare for it.</p>

        <p>Gov. George W. Bush may be a fun date, but he's not the kind of guy you want to settle down with. So says the chairwoman of the Texas Democratic Party, Molly Beth Malcolm, one of more than 70 Democratic officials from 34 states who met here today with Vice President Al Gore and his senior campaign staff.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore has been lagging Mr. Bush in the public opinion polls, the meeting was not an emergency session but a long-planned chance for the campaign to coordinate with its state emissaries. Many left the impression that they were not worried about an election more than five months away, although they were trying to prepare for it.</p>
        <p>''One of the basic tenets of politics,'' said Paul Berendt, Democratic chairman in Washington State, ''is that you don't fight the battle in May that you need to fight in October.''</p>
        <p>The state officials said they recognized that voters seemed to like Mr. Bush's personality more than Mr. Gore's, but they suggested that the more voters saw of Mr. Bush, the less they would like him.</p>
        <p>Ms. Malcolm put it most graphically: ''He's the guy you want to go to the ballgame with, he's the guy you want to come to your party because he's going to be lots of fun. But it reminds me of when I was in college. There were lots of guys who were lots of fun to go out with, and you wanted them at your party, but when it came time to settle down, he wasn't the one you're looking for.''</p>
        <p>Later, for the first time in quite a few weeks, Mr. Gore referred to his vanquished Democratic primary foe, former Senator Bill Bradley, with some graciousness, a hint that the icy relationship between them might be beginning to thaw.</p>
        <p>''One of our greatest challenges, as Bill Bradley so eloquently said during the primaries, is that we need to bring our people together,'' Mr. Gore said at a low-key fund-raising reception tonight in calling for anti-hate-crime legislation.</p>
