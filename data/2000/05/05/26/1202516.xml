        <p>Elliott Green's paintings look like Saturday morning cartoons filtered through a child's feverish delirium. Rubbery arms and legs with bizarrely swollen fingers and toes, big scary shoes and sad, misshapen faces are packed into weirdly abstracted, emotionally charged scenarios.</p>
        <p>Imagery ranges from the explicit, as in ''Forgivable Kindness,'' in which a large old woman embraces a gnomish boy, to the obliquely fragmentary, as in ''Farmer Farming,'' which zeroes in on a mysterious, erotically suggestive entanglement of limbs, extremities and torsos.</p>

        <p>Elliott Green's paintings look like Saturday morning cartoons filtered through a child's feverish delirium. Rubbery arms and legs with bizarrely swollen fingers and toes, big scary shoes and sad, misshapen faces are packed into weirdly abstracted, emotionally charged scenarios.</p>
        <p>Imagery ranges from the explicit, as in ''Forgivable Kindness,'' in which a large old woman embraces a gnomish boy, to the obliquely fragmentary, as in ''Farmer Farming,'' which zeroes in on a mysterious, erotically suggestive entanglement of limbs, extremities and torsos.</p>
        <p>Even as they tap into elemental desires and anxieties, Mr. Green's easel-size canvases remain works of great formal elegance, combining carefully penciled serpentine lines, tightly interlocking de Kooningesque compositions, muted primary colors and satiny surfaces. A change from the larger, more open compositions of his last show, these have a taut, Cubist punch.</p>
        <p>A small computer screen in the gallery's foyer offers a fascinating, digitalized view of the process by which Mr. Green arrives at his imagery. Stop-action animation shows pencil drawings morphing from allover scribbles to finished representations.</p>
        <p>Like Miro's or Gorky's, Mr. Green's visions arise not from preconceived ideas but from his engagement in formal metamorphosis, which accounts for the urgent sensuousness of his work and its continuing, evolutionary intrigue.</p>
