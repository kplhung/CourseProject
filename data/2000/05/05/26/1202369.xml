        <p>Philadelphia is 100 miles south of New York City. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>FOUR SEASONS, 1 Logan Square, (215) 963-1500. The opulent, flower-filled lobby tells the story: no expense has been spared here. But as one of the hotel's executives says, ''The mahogany and marble are the easy parts.'' The hard part is building a skilled, attentive, kindly staff, and the Seasons succeeds superbly on that count, too. The Fountain dining room, where Jean-Marie Lacroix has presided since 1983, is the peer of any restaurant in town. Computer connections, a bit dated, are to be modernized soon. Double room: $240 to $320, weekends; $305 to $400, weekdays.</p>
        <p>LOEWS, 1200 Market Street, (215) 627-1200. A tip of the Apple hat to the Tisch family, which has converted the landmark PSFS building into a hotel of ravishing Art Deco beauty. The old vault doors and silvery sans-serif signs have been used to great graphic effect in the lobby, amidst acres of rosewood and etched glass. The 583 bedrooms murmur ''Hollywood, 1930,'' with a chaise longue in every one; a club-floor library holds vintage books. Double room:  $175 to $365.</p>
        <p>RITTENHOUSE, 210 West Rittenhouse Square, (215) 546-9000. The harsh zigzag facade does little for the harmony of the urban environment, though it gives the 128 guest rooms leafy views. Otherwise, the Rittenhouse is hard to fault, with a central location, an invitingly cool lobby and bedrooms swimming with space. Each has a desk tucked into an alcove, a fax and a video tape player, plus a dressing area and a marble bathroom with an oversize tub and separate stall shower. The low-key service is charmingly accommodating. Double rooms from $360; occasional weekend specials from $200.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>LE BEC-FIN, 1523 Walnut Street, (215) 567-1000. When Paul Bocuse visited Georges Perrier's formal little jewel box, with its raspberry-pink walls and tapestry-covered chairs, he pronounced it ''a real restaurant, more like Lyons than New York.'' The cooking is classical, lightened and brightened here and there with an Asian spice like Sichuan pepper. European fish (loup, turbot) are a specialty, as are desserts, dispensed from a calorie chariot five levels high. Great cheeses; great, very costly French wines.</p>
        <p>FORK, 306 Market Street, (215) 625-9425. With bare floors, an open kitchen, and a fixation on freshness worthy of Alice Waters, this is the perfect place for lunch on a tour of the city's Colonial shrines. Try the satisfyingly rustic chicken-mushroom-barley soup, a fishy or meaty salad and the chocolate cake with banana gelato, plus a beer from the cosmopolitan list.</p>
        <p>PASION!, 211 South 15th Street, (215) 875-9895. For my money, Guillermo Pernot's nuevo Latino cooking is the most exciting in Philadelphia at the moment. A superlative chili-laced ceviche of Chilean sea bass and seaweed, presented alongside a scallop shell, is served with big smiles in a tented room full of palms and bright fabrics. Likewise, an Argentine mixed grill, a Haitian empanada and the very best Chilean wines.</p>
        <p>PAT'S KING OF STEAKS, Ninth and Wharton Streets, (215) 468-1546. This is the real deal: these are the folks who gave the world the Philly cheese steak -- thinly sliced, quickly grilled beef, slapped onto an Italian roll, slathered with Cheez-Whiz, topped with onions. Pat's stands on a triangular traffic island in the heart of Rocky country, South Philadelphia, across the street from an asphalt basketball court. You order your sandwich at a tiny window and eat it at a plastic table, right on the street. It's silly, sloppy and, in its own way, sublime.</p>
        <p>STRIPED BASS, 1500 Walnut Street, (215) 732-4444. The lofty ceilings and the marble columns of this erstwhile banking hall, built in 1927, always put me in a mellow mood, as do the Fortuny lighting fixtures and the snazzy metal fish hanging overhead. Terence Feury, an alumnus of Le Bernardin in Manhattan, has refreshed a tired menu with distinctive, unpompous dishes like crisp-skinned striped bass (what else?) served on a tangle of bitter greens.</p>
        <p>SUSANNA FOO, 1512 Walnut Street, (215) 545-2666. Born in Mongolia, Sue Foo, as the local Asian grocers like to call her, is equally at home with Asian and European culinary traditions. In a dining room full of orchids and Asian art, she serves a trio of dumplings (shrimp, duck, lobster), each in a deliciously different wrapper, and dares to pair fish in a tangy, winy sauce with sweet rice. Five-spice Pennsylvania venison is another hit.</p>
        <p>TANGERINE, 232 Market Street, (215) 627-5116. This semi-nightclub is the town's hot spot, so you have to put up with noise, semi-pro service and dim, candle-lighted, souk-like passageways. But most of the Moroccan fantasy food is well worth it, notably gnocchi with dates and harissa and a honey-and-lamb tagine, cooked in a crockery dish with a top shaped like a coolie's hat. The fish and the duck are overdone. Comfortably low-backed leather chairs; dandy desserts (chocolate cake streaked with tangerine) from Laurie Shapiro.</p>
        <p>Attractions</p>
        <p>ACADEMY OF MUSIC, 1420 Locust Street, at Broad Street, (215) 893-1999. The next program is the Pennsylvania Ballet's production of ''Dracula,'' opening Wednesday and running through June 11. Tickets: $15 to $86.
