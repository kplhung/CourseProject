        <p>William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) and Maxfield Parrish (1870-1966), a generation apart, were in their day very popular artists. Each wielded a brush with true virtuosity; Chase in a filtered Impressionist style seen as ''high'' art, Parrish in a tight, finicky illustrational mode that left out no detail. They had little else in common until now, with the conjunction of their shows at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>It is a matter of logistics: the Chase show was ready just as the touring Parrish show was scheduled to make its Brooklyn stop. But the simultaneity of these two very American exhibitions will, it is hoped, direct attention to one of the world's most important collections of American art: the 2,500 paintings, sculptures, watercolors and pastels dating from 1720 to 1945 in the Brooklyn Museum's collection. (Its American galleries are to undergo an extensive reinstallation and reopen in July 2001. The department is also working on a long-awaited catalog of the American collection.)</p>
        <p>Of the shows, the more aesthetically significant is ''William Merritt Chase: Modern American Landscapes, 1886-1890,'' organized by Barbara Dayer Gallati, curator of American painting and sculpture at the museum. Chase had a long, distinguished run as a painter, teacher and art politician, but Ms. Gallati zeros in on the five-year period when his career was at low tide. She has come up with new insights about the Brooklyn and Manhattan paintings Chase did in those years.</p>
        <p>The 35 oils and pastels in the show are important not so much for their scenic content, engaging as it is, but because they are the first paintings in which an Impressionist style was used to depict American subjects.</p>
        <p>Although many of his urban park and coastal scenes are quite familiar, Ms. Gallati wondered why some of the works, long identified as sites in Central and Prospect Parks, didn't really look like those places. Closer inspection revealed misidentifications. Some of the Prospect Park scenes, for instance, really depicted Tompkins Park (now called Von King Park) in Bedford-Stuyvesant -- today much modified from its appearance in Chase's time -- and the Brooklyn Navy Yard.</p>
        <p>Having corrected those longstanding errors, Ms. Gallati began to examine the genteel Brooklyn and Manhattan scenes of 1886 to 1890, reflecting a privileged, upper-class view, in broader cultural terms. Chase painted them, she writes in the show's catalog, not only because they were part of his Brooklyn surroundings at the time; he also wanted to present them to the world as examples of ''civilized urban landscapes'' that accorded with the European avant-garde model of modern life.</p>
        <p>A group was shown at the 1889 Paris Exposition Universelle, one of the great world's fairs, where they were the only American views that referred to a specific American city and its environs.</p>
        <p>Their presentation at such an august event, Ms. Gallati argues, means that they had special significance for the artist.</p>
        <p>What's more, the paintings marked a transition in Chase's style. Their airy lightness was in sharp contrast to the dark, Old Masterish tones of the Munich school in which he was trained, criticized by American art writers as too European, writes Ms. Gallati.</p>
        <p>The more avant-garde Impressionist manner in which he did the park paintings was no less European, but because the Impressionists had no role in training Americans, as the Munich teachers did, Chase effectively silenced his American critics while setting himself up as a peer of his innovative French contemporaries.</p>
        <p>Three paintings in the Brooklyn show were among those exhibited at the Paris fair. One, ''A City Park'' (1887), showing a fashionable woman with her dog, seated on a bench along a wide path in Tompkins Park (previously identified as Central or Prospect Park), looks particularly French in its bright atmosphere, strong compositional perspective and seeming spontaneity of observation. Chase's focus on isolated women in public spaces, suggests Ms. Gallati, was his way of defining the spaces in terms of feminine refinement.</p>
        <p>Possibly for the same reason, ''Afternoon in the Park'' (circa 1887), an elegant pastel of his wife, Alice, in a salmon pink gown and straw hat with red trim, is set amid sunlit greenery in the park of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The spot was near the Naval Lyceum, a museum and library founded in 1833 by naval and marine officers but no longer in existence.</p>
        <p>An earlier transitional painting of Mrs. Chase, a lovely small oil of 1886, shows her sitting pensively in a rowboat, presumably on the lake in Prospect Park. Its tight cropping and thin, form-modeling passages of paint show Chase's effort to move away from the turgidity of the Munich style.</p>
        <p>After moving to Manhattan in late 1887 or early 1888, Chase began to paint in Central Park, producing peaceful scenes like ''The Lake for Miniature Yachts'' (1888), formally known as ''Conservatory Water.'' Combining landscape with figures, unusual for that time, it shows a broad expanse of path with children attending toy boats. A flotilla bobs on the shimmering water, with a middle-distance landscape of greenery as background.</p>
        <p>Its avant-garde compositional strategies, cued by European construction of pictorial space, show Chase's efforts to be modern.</p>
        <p>''A Bit of the Terrace'' (circa 1890), focuses on one of Chase's favorite Central Park locales, the Bethesda Fountain Terrace, here portrayed as a peaceful setting for women and children.</p>
        <p>In the foreground a decorous infant, dressed head-to-toe in white, plays with a red ball while its mother  strolls nearby.</p>
        <p>This bland scene contrasts with the usual depictions of more strenuous park activities in illustrated magazines and newspapers: games, concerts, carriage driving, skating. Chase, according to Ms. Gallati, wanted to support the idea of the park as a source of spiritual elevation and refinement, the view held by its designers, Frederic Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.</p>
        <p>Chase's urban landscapes ended with his move to the Shinnecock Hills  on Long Island's East End after the summer of 1890, where he headed a highly successful summer art school devoted to plein-air painting. As a sort of finale, a wonderful Shinnecock beachscape is included in the show: ''Wind Swept Sands, Shinnecock, Long Island'' (circa 1894), an austere, lonely portrayal of dunes on a gray day.</p>
        <p>Informed by the more expansive view of landscape he had acquired in painting his park scenes, Chase's Shinnecock paintings serve as aesthetic ancestors to many a view of eastern Long Island by his 20th-century successors.</p>
        <p>While Chase dealt with the here and now -- however sanitized -- in his paintings, Parrish pursued a never-never world of chaste but titillating young women and knightly men in pastoral landscapes that melded medieval towers with New England forests, Western gorges and the deep blue skies of fairy kingdoms.</p>
        <p>The show here, ''Maxfield Parrish: 1870-1966,'' organized by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the American Federation of Arts, presents more than 140 paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, illustrations and ephemera by this deep-dyed fabulist, the son of an upper-caste Philadelphia Quaker family.</p>
        <p>Reproductions of his paintings sold like hotcakes to a mass market audience, and he also made a more than respectable living as an advertising and magazine illustrator.</p>
        <p>As an illustrator, he could be considered the father of Norman Rockwell, although his powers of invention were greater. His gift for design is evident in modernistic creations like ''School Days (Alphabet),'' a 1908 cover design for Collier's magazine. In it a riotous swarm of alphabet letters stream from the pages of a child's open textbook, burying him as he attempts to learn his ABC's.</p>
        <p>An exacting draftsman as well as a clever colorist, Parrish accomplished his impeccable oil paintings by the painstaking application of many thin layers of transparent glazes over bases of monochrome ink or paint.</p>
        <p>Some of the more familiar Parrish chestnuts are on view here, like ''Daybreak'' (1922), the first painting he created specifically for reproduction as an art print. A beautiful young maiden, robed, lies on a marble-columned porch as a luminous dawn breaks over a majestic mountain range. A young goddess, naked, presumably Dawn, leans over the maiden to witness her ecstatic awakening. To sexual ripening? Whatever, it has been estimated that by 1925 this essay in veiled eroticism could be found on the walls of one out of every four American households.</p>
        <p>In quite a different vein is the mural ''Old King Cole'' (1894), a large triptych originally done for the University of Pennsylvania's Mask and Wig Club in Philadelphia. A coy, cartoony rendition of the nursery rhyme, it shows the merry king on his throne, serenaded by his fiddlers three and attendants bearing pipe and bowl. (In 1905 Parrish reworked the King Cole theme into a mural for the old Knickerbocker Hotel on Times Square; in 1935 it was transferred to the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, where it remains on view today in the King Cole Bar.)</p>
        <p>Parrish never regarded himself as more than a popular artist (''My skies were too blue,'' he told me in an interview shortly before his death), but the revival of ''high art'' interest in his work that began with the advent of Pop Art continues.</p>
        <p>And there is enough in this show -- particularly his graphic art and some fine landscapes -- to sustain that interest.</p>
        <p>''William Merritt Chase: Modern American Landscapes, 1886-1890'' is at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Aug. 13. ''Maxfield Parrish: 1870-1966'' is there through Aug. 6.</p>
