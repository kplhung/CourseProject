        <p>Over the last 20 years, as the New York City subway system has painstakingly resurrected itself, it has shed many of the worst adjectives it picked up in the 1960's and 1970's: filthy, dangerous, unreliable.</p>
        <p>Graffiti has been all but scrubbed away. Crime continues to drop. It has been years since the Straphangers Campaign talked about ''mystery trains,'' the ones that seemed to roam the tracks like Flying Dutchmen, heedless of rider or route.</p>
        <p>But as more and more New Yorkers are venturing back down into the subway, they are still being greeted by at least one nasty acquaintance from the old days, one that was never really rousted: the Screech.</p>
        <p>''It hurts,'' said Anna Santiago, a 40-year-old mother of three, jamming her fingers in her ears the other day at Union Square, where a southbound No. 4 train screamed like a broken band saw as it inched alongside the platform. Beside her, a half-dozen other people were also wincing and plugging their ears.</p>
        <p>Down the platform, a group of transit workers were not plugging their ears; most were wearing protective mufflers, the heavy-duty kind commonly worn by airport workers.</p>
        <p>''It seems like it's even louder down here than when I was a kid,'' said Ms. Santiago, yelling to be heard.</p>
        <p>As much as it seemed so in the din, that is probably not the case. Since 1982, when the State Legislature passed a law requiring New York City Transit to reduce noise, the agency has spent millions of dollars -- grudgingly and not always effectively, its critics contend -- to bring a little more peace to the platforms.</p>
        <p>New machines were used to make sure trains' steel wheels were straightened, or ''trued,'' so they would roll without scraping. Wheels were fitted with stainless steel hoops to muffle ringing noises, in the same way a hand placed on a bell blunts the sound. Resilient rubber pads were installed beneath nearly all elevated rails and many underground rails, to quiet rumbling by reducing the vibration transferred to rails and trestles.</p>
        <p>In addition, subway cars with quieter motors were bought in the early 1980's, after noise experts placed pressure on the transit authority. (Brand-new cars being tested now will replace the oldest and noisiest trains.) Rails are being welded together to quiet the clacking of wheels over gaps. And over the years, the authority has squirted thousands of gallons of lithium-based grease onto the sides of tracks, using about 200 pumps placed near curves, where screeching is always worse.</p>
        <p>''I can tell you that if you were in these subway stations in the 1970's, you would have heard some unbelievable sounds,'' said Al O'Leary, the chief spokesman for New York City Transit, who said the agency gets few noise complaints. ''We have really done a lot over the years.''</p>
        <p>Despite those efforts, many experts say there are still horrible noise conditions at dozens of stations around the city, conditions that not only create stress and anger and even pain, but can also permanently damage hearing. Some experts and riders' advocates attribute the situation, in large part, to what they contend was the city's bare-minimum effort over more than a decade to meet the requirements of the 1982 law, called the Rapid Transit Noise Code.</p>
        <p>The experts add that since 1994, noise problems have fallen to the bottom of the authority's long list of priorities. That was the year New York City Transit's legal department reviewed the language of the law and concluded that it had expired, a decision that has not been challenged.</p>
        <p>''I pay attention to this, and I ride the subway every day, and I am certain that the system is getting louder again,'' said Arline L. Bronzaft, an environmental psychologist who is a member of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Council on the Environment and chairwoman of its noise committee.</p>
        <p>''Once this legislation died, they didn't have to answer to anyone, and they haven't,'' said Dr. Bronzaft, a former professor of psychology at the City University of New York who has been a prominent researcher on the health effects of noise and a frequent critic of the transit agency.</p>
        <p>Carmine Santa Maria, a retired postal worker who founded the Big Screechers, a mostly defunct group of noise experts and community leaders that for years put pressure on transit officials to quiet the system, said he had also noticed the volume slowly increasing again.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Santa Maria, 64, it was the hair-raising din of the B line elevated tracks near his home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, that caused his transformation into, at one time, the city's best known anti-noise advocate. And it was largely through the efforts of the Big Screechers that the transit noise code was passed.</p>
        <p>But now, he says, the issue seems to have fallen from the civic radar, he no longer has the energy to fight New York City Transit, and the tracks near his house, hushed for a while, are once again waking him up at night.</p>
        <p>''The best nights for me to sleep are when it's raining, because the water coats the tracks and the noise goes away,'' said Mr. Santa Maria, who then put the receiver near the window during a recent phone interview so a reporter could hear the intermittent squealing in the background.</p>
        <p>Transit officials say they do not systematically measure sound levels in the subways, and the agency no longer has a centralized noise abatement program. But the officials add that they do still consider noise a high-priority issue in the subway, and while they no longer comply with the letter of the noise law, which required them to send annual reports to the governor and the State Legislature detailing their noise-abatement efforts, they have continued to try to eliminate noise.</p>
        <p>They have, for example, even resorted to what one track maintenance official called a ''radical solution'' for the worst noise problems. At the South Ferry station on the No. 1 and No. 9 lines, where the trains make a hairpin turnaround to head back north -- long creating one of the most deafening screeches in the system -- the agency installed a water sprinkler system that coats the rails along the curve with a fine mist.</p>
        <p>The sprinkler system has also been installed on curves north of the Fulton Street station on the Lexington Avenue line and north and south of Grand Central Terminal.</p>
        <p>''That eliminates a lot of the high-pitched noise,'' said Antonio Cabrera, a director of track maintenance and engineering. ''But the downside to it is that it creates havoc with the maintenance of the hardware of the track. Things rust; things deteriorate. Water on the tracks is really not something you want to have.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cabrera added that he and other engineers were experimenting with newer lubricants applied directly to the top of the rail, as opposed to grease, which is pumped onto the sides so it will not make train wheels slip.</p>
        <p>The new substances, which are not slippery, can be either brushed onto the rails or continuously applied to the wheels of the train using a device that looks something like a deodorant stick. The intended effect is to reduce friction between the rail and the wheel, making both last longer and, officials hope, lowering the volume in the platforms.</p>
        <p>''All these things can work together to tend to reduce noise,'' said Kenneth Mooney, a senior director of track maintenance and engineering.</p>
        <p>But he added, ''By its nature, operating heavy trains on metal rails is going to create noise.''</p>
        <p>Especially in a sprawling system with aging trains and tunnels approaching a hundred years old, it is a truism that has caused even the agency's most ambitious quieting efforts to fall short.</p>
        <p>Last week, Nancy B. Nadler, the director of the Noise Center at the League for the Hard of Hearing, carried a $14,000 decibel meter onto the platform at the South Ferry station, to see how much the sprinkler system had reduced noise levels.</p>
        <p>As a southbound train rolled into the station, it emitted a low moan instead of the familiar metal screech, registering around 100 decibels, slightly more than the noise produced by a garbage disposal. (Guidelines set by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health state that continued exposure to 100 decibels for more than 15 minutes can put workers at risk of permanent hearing loss.)</p>
        <p>But as the train left the station, the noise increased to 104 decibels and the train began to emit the familiar screech. (An increase of 10 decibels is perceived by the human ear as a doubling of the noise level.)</p>
        <p>Two trains later, it seemed as if the sprinkler system had stopped having any effect. A train made a long, high-pitched squeal that registered 116 decibels: slightly less than a chain saw, slightly more than a leaf blower, but several painful octaves higher.</p>
        <p>At Union Square, long one of the noisiest stations in the city because of its curved tracks, Ms. Nadler found the results not much better: nearly every train was announced by several seconds of deafening screeching and most registered from 107 to 112 decibels. (The National Institute says that continued exposure to 112 decibels for more than 56 seconds can be dangerous.)</p>
        <p>''There's no question that this will hurt your hearing,'' Ms. Nadler said. ''If you are exposed to this every morning, you will have hearing loss.''</p>
        <p>So what can be done? A state senator from Brooklyn has an idea, though he acknowledges that it stands little chance of making it through the Legislature this year -- or probably any year.</p>
        <p>A bill introduced last year by the senator, Carl Kruger, would require the transit authority to post, at any station where workers found the noise level to be above 90 decibels, a sign stating that fact and adding: ''Medical experiments have proven that extended exposure to noise at or above this level will result in a loss of hearing and may be harmful to your health. The use of hearing protectors is recommended.'' The sign would be required to have a telephone number for contacting the authority.</p>
        <p>''What the bill would try to do would be put the T.A.'s feet to the fire and say, 'We'd like you to live up to the standards that were set for you a long time ago,' '' Mr. Kruger said.</p>
        <p>He admitted that such a law would probably expose the agency to a flood of lawsuits. But Mr. Kruger said his hope was that instead of posting the signs, the authority would just try harder to hush the system so that it would not have to post the signs and get the complaints.</p>
        <p>''It would be like putting a sign on your car that says, 'Hello, officer. I'm speeding,' '' he said. ''Wouldn't that make you careful not to speed?''</p>
