        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* FIONA APPLE, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. Fiona Apple's last New York appearance, at Roseland, ended ignominiously when the singer and songwriter, unable to hear herself in the monitors, threw a fit of agony so long and difficult to watch it made ''Saving Private Ryan'' seem like a laugh fest. Maybe her behavior wasn't professional, but she did it for the sake of her music, which is too complicated to be sacrificed to a poor sound system. Now she will attempt her gorgeously, gracefully tangled songs in a different setting. Here's hoping that the sound system cooperates and, if not, that she rides the wave. Tonight at 8; admission is $27.50 (Ann Powers).</p>

        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* FIONA APPLE, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, Manhattan, (212) 496-7070. Fiona Apple's last New York appearance, at Roseland, ended ignominiously when the singer and songwriter, unable to hear herself in the monitors, threw a fit of agony so long and difficult to watch it made ''Saving Private Ryan'' seem like a laugh fest.

Now she will attempt her gorgeously, gracefully tangled songs in a different setting. Here's hoping that the sound system cooperates and, if not, that she rides the wave. Tonight at 8; admission is $27.50 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>LUCECITA BENITEZ, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. With a husky, powerful voice full of tragic bravado and a repertory drawn from across Latin America, Lucecita Benitez is Puerto Rico's diva of nueva cancion. She sings about lost love, about Latin American identity, about loss and about hope, turning ballads into grand statements. Tonight at 8; tickets are $25 to $59 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JOEY CALDERAZZO TRIO, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Though only in his mid-30's, Mr. Calderazzo, the new pianist for the Branford Marsalis band and a longtime associate of Michael Brecker, is one of those 60's-era burners: he holds tenaciously to the reins of a tune, shaking intensity into it. Another reason to hear him this week: the rhythm section consists of Christian McBride and Jeff Watts, two great musicians who have had much to do with the way mainstream jazz sounded in the last 15 years or so. Sets through Sunday are at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $17.50; $20 for tonight and tomorrow; $10 minimum (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>CELTIC JAZZ COLLECTIVE, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. This group, led by the guitarist David O'Rourke (from Celtic music) and the drummer Lewis Nash (from jazz), comes to answer all those questions you have about how, exactly, Celtic music and jazz, swinging rhythm sections and accordion-guitar front lines, can coexist today. But some of these musicians, including the violinist Regina Carter, are virtuosos, and they have the power to explain. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8 and 10:30 p.m. and midnight, with a cover of $25 and $18 for the midnight set 18; on Sunday night, sets are at 7 and 9, with a cover of $18 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>CHARMING HOSTESS, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680; Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055; Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Fans of an esoteric good time have three chances to catch the San Francisco Bay Area's finest Jewish-American klezmer-blues-folk rock band, purveying its magical blend of haunting female vocals, piercing feminist thought and danceable music. Charming Hostess is a phenomenon unto itself, so if you miss these shows, it had better be because you're out of town. Tonight at 11 at Fez; admission is $10. Tomorrow night at 10 at the Knitting Factory; admission is $10. Sunday night at 9:30 at Tonic; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>VINICIUS CANTUARIA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7504. Vinicius Cantuaria is steeped in the bossa nova: its gently brushed guitar chords, its quietly elaborate melodies, its shades of sensuality and melancholy. He knows it well enough to stretch the form without losing its essence. Tonight at 10; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>ELIANE ELIAS TRIO, Iridium, 48 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. Ms. Elias, a pianist from Brazil, is well versed in music from all the Americas, and her recent career has been an impressive experiment in trying to reconcile the different kinds, most often Brazilian music and jazz. Sets are tonight through Sunday at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; cover charge is $25 and $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>ORRIN EVANS TRIO, Caviarteria, 310 West Broadway, at Canal Street, SoHo, (212) 925-5515. Mr. Evans is a strong young jazz pianist from Philadelphia, steeped in Thelonious Monk's sly repetition and between-the-cracks rhythmic weight but with up-to-date ideas about arranging for small groups. He'll have the drummer Rodney Green with him this time, and together they always achieve ignition. Music is tonight from 9 to 1; no cover, $20 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>RUTH GERSON, Sidewalk, 94 Avenue A, at East Sixth Street, East Village, (212) 473-7373. With a voice that rises from tender endearments to a bluesy, impassioned growl, Ruth Gerson sings folk-rock songs that reach for the status of anthems. She's a Bob Dylan fan who can be as conversational as Alanis Morissette or as galvanic as Bruce Springsteen, and she brings her full band. Tonight at 10 p.m.; $3 minimum no cover charge (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* LUNA, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Embracing the legacy of two-guitar bands from the Velvet Underground to Television, Luna applies the dynamics of strum, drone and build to Dean Wareham's tales of longing and decadence. As he sings about high-toned parties, aimless road trips and creeping paranoia, the songs start out cool, but the writhing, swelling guitars reveal the obsessions within them. Tonight and tomorrow doors open at 9:30 with Luna performing at 11 p.m.; admission is $14 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>LYRES, Continental, 25 Third Avenue, at St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 529-6924. The Lyres, led by Jeff (Mono Man) Conolly with his earnest-to-manic vocals and tootling electric organ, have been a Boston garage-rock mainstay since 1980. Mr. Conolly, the group's only constant, writes three-minute stompers in belated 1960's style, sometimes stealing riffs if they're useful. With sets that include the Lyres' own songs and decidedly obscure 60's material, the band is ready for the next garage-rock revival. Tomorrow at midnight; doors open at 8 p.m.; admission is $12 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>MARTHA WASH, Flushing Town Hall, 137-35 Northern Boulevard, one block east of Main Street, Flushing, Queens, (718) 463-7700. Despite the title of the voluptuous Ms. Wash's giant hit as part of the Weather Girls, it will not be raining men at this special concert. It will be raining holiness as the majestically gifted singer offers it up in a night of gospel and spiritual favorites. Tonight at 8; admission is $24; $20 for members (Powers).</p>
        <p>BUSTER POINDEXTER AND HIS SPANISH ROCKETSHIP, Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-7880. David Johansen's hard-partying alter ego, Buster Poindexter, discovered Caribbean music when he had a hit with Arrow's ''Hot! Hot! Hot!'' long before Ricky Martin. Now he has immersed himself in salsa and its kin from across the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, bringing it back to Anglos in one of its longtime guises: music to lose inhibitions by. As he sings about the newly sanitized Times Square or his romantic misadventures backed by his Spanish Rocketship band, he's an unlikely heir to Carmen Miranda. Tomorrow at 8 and 11 p.m.; tickets are $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>PRIMAL SCREAM, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. Punk, politics, dance music and funny noises get all mashed up in the songs of Primal Scream. Over relentless, machine-driven riffs, screeches of guitar feedback and whizzing synthesizers punctuate sneering fulminations about things like ''a military-industrial illusion of democracy.'' Fans can consider the message or enjoy the sonic melee. Sunday at 8 p.m.; tickets are $24 in advance, $26 on Sunday (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SASHA AND JOHN DIGWEED, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 268-1600. A longing for rapture and transcendence is never far from the surface of dance music, particularly in the utopian pulsations set out by the English disc jockey partnership of John Digweed and Sasha. In their marathon sets of dance music, steady repetition holds time at bay and floating, whooshing sounds and voices suggest freedom from the rigors of form. Tonight; doors open at 11 p.m., with Jimmy Van M warming up and John Digweed and Sasha continuing well past dawn. Admission is $35 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>*  TED LEO, JULIE DOIRON, A-SET, HAYWOOD, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 420-8392. This show promises to be a fine colloquy between the sexes. Albert Menduno of A-Set and Ted Leo are sensitive guys unafraid to muss up their indie rock sound with new tools like a sampler and a pump organ. Julie Doiron is a fierce woman unrelentingly exploring the edges of their soft sides. Sunday at 8 p.m.; admission is $8 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* STEREO TOTAL, SOLEX, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Outre old records and gadgets that blip, click and whir fascinate Stereo Total and Solex. Stereo Total, from Berlin, uses cheap synthesizers and goofy samples to back deadpan pop salutations in English, French and German, aptly described in a line from their new album: ''A little bit strange but really funny.'' Elisabeth Esselink, a k a Solex, writes and sings whimsical chronicles of the everyday bohemian life, set to samples from obscure LP's at the used-record store she runs in Amsterdam. Her songs make narcissism so low-key and cleverly orchestrated that it's charming. Tonight and tomorrow at 9 p.m., with the Rondelles opening; admission is $10 and $12 day of show (Pareles).</p>
        <p>STYX, REO SPEEDWAGON, EDDIE MONEY, Jones Beach, Meadowbrook Parkway South, Long Island, (516) 221-1000. The majesty of overblown Top-40-aimed rock is in full feather on this triple bill of 1970's stalwarts. Sure, everyone hates generic alternative music, but back in the disco era rock was even more proudly manipulative and/or floridly pretentious. Styx, a band that really wanted to be the cast of ''Godspell''; REO Speedwagon, purveyors of leather-couch makeout music; and Eddie Money, an ex-policeman with a stylishly unloosened tie, represent the era perfectly. Tonight at 7; tickets are $34 and $44(Powers).</p>
        <p>* VISION FESTIVAL, New Age Cabaret, 23 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 533-1939. Weekend two of the indefatigable outer-limits jazz series. (For tonight's bill, see Page 1 of Weekend.) Tomorrow, Bill Dixon, the trumpeter and composer, presents an orchestral premiere, ''Index,'' with an assemblage of players who form the bricks and mortar of the Vision festival; Bobby Few, the Paris-based pianist from Steve Lacy's old band, makes a rare New York appearance; and the guitarist Joe Morris will perform with his trio. Sunday's events include a duet by the pianist Myra Melford and the saxophonist Marty Ehrlich, two Midwesterners who transplanted themselves to New York to produce all sorts of music reconciling the experimental and the traditional. There will also be a duet by the electronic provocateur DJ Spooky and the pianist Matthew Shipp; a performance by William Parker's Little Huey Creative Music Ensemble; a drum solo by Jerome Cooper; and a reunion of James Blood Ulmer's Music Revelation Ensemble, a powerful avant-funk outfit including the saxophonist David Murray, which made some fine records a decade ago. Music runs from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m.; tickets are $20 a night (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>WEEN, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. If you love Dean and Gene Ween, the dynamic duo from New Hope, Pa., then you'll be eager for more twisted parodies of pop tunes and social mores, all swirled together in a delicious cone of rock 'n' roll. If you find their antics too juvenile to make up for their undeniable musical gifts, stay home and listen to something serious. Tonight at 8; tickets are $22 (Powers).</p>
        <p>BUSTER WILLIAMS AND SOMETHING MORE, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. The bassist Buster Williams's small group has had some lineup changes over the last few years, but he has never lacked great musicians: at the moment he has the alto saxophonist Steve Wilson, the pianist Mulgrew Miller and the drummer Lenny White. They make steady, intelligent music, mainstream jazz with feeling and insight. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11 p.m.; cover charge is $25; $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>ROBIN WILLIAMSON, STRAPPING FIELDHANDS, THE TOWER RECORDINGS, Cooler, 416 West 14th Street, West Village, (212) 229-0785. With the Incredible String Band back in the 1960's, Robin Williamson fused Celtic tradition with psychedelic whimsy and all sorts of international inflections, from ragas to Middle Eastern music to Gilbert and Sullivan. There's still a twinkle in his eye as he plays the Celtic harp and spins tales. The Strapping Fieldhands play rowdy, low-fidelity songs that sneak the melodies of 60's pop behind a flailing attack. And the Tower Recordings let tunes drift into gentle, neo-psychedelic rambles. Tomorrow night at 8:15; admission is $15 and $20 (Pareles).</p>
