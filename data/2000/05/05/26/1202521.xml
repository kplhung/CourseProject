        <p>Dickinson Roundell, the New York branch of a London-based gallery group, has inaugurated its new Manhattan space with this group exhibition, which is about as glamorous as gallery roundups get.</p>
        <p>Chronologically, the lineup starts with a postcardish Delacroix watercolor of a Moroccan woman done in 1832, and ends with a small, tissuey Agnes Martin piece from 1977.</p>

        <p>Dickinson Roundell</p>
        <p>19 East 66th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through June 2</p>
        <p>Dickinson Roundell, the New York branch of a London-based gallery group, has inaugurated its new Manhattan space with this group exhibition, which is about as glamorous as gallery roundups get.</p>
        <p>Chronologically, the lineup starts with a postcardish Delacroix watercolor of a Moroccan woman done in 1832, and ends with a small, tissuey Agnes Martin piece from 1977.</p>
        <p>Among landscape images in between, three are neck-and-neck favorites: a Cezanne watercolor of chestnut trees, all space and light; a dashing little Pissarro view of Louveciennes, and a van Gogh pencil sketch of a field seen from his hospital window at St. Remy, with tufts of grass-like explosions.</p>
        <p>There are some marvelous portraits. Degas's 1867 drawing of the wistful, moon-faced Mme. Gaujelin is matched in its cool sensuality by a muscle-perfect depiction of a race horse from a few years later. Picasso's very early portrait of his friend Josep Cardona is all glum Romantic self-importance, while James Tissot's high-polish watercolor version of an oil painting depicts a tired-looking model holding a flower between her teeth.</p>
        <p>Two beautiful Kurt Schwitters collages, dense with fabric and paint, take the show beyond the traditional works-on-paper category, as does a Paul Klee oil painting of colored bands spinning off into darkness.</p>
        <p>And with Lucio Fontana's oval of blotting paper pierced by jagged holes, we are in the realm of sculpture.</p>
        <p>In short, no theme or focus here, just dozens of world-class items brought together, briefly and free for the looking, under one roof.</p>
