        <p>The Justice Department said today that it was sending George A. Stamboulidis, a respected prosecutor from Long Island who is experienced in organized crime and public corruption cases, to lead the prosecution of the scientist accused of illegally downloading highly sensitive nuclear weapons secrets at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stamboulidis, who successfully prosecuted a number of organized crime figures in the Genovese, Colombo and Luchese crime families, will take over from Bob Gorence, an assistant United States attorney in Albuquerque, where the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, will be tried.</p>

        <p>The Justice Department said today that it was sending George A. Stamboulidis, a respected prosecutor from Long Island who is experienced in organized crime and public corruption cases, to lead the prosecution of the scientist accused of illegally downloading highly sensitive nuclear weapons secrets at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stamboulidis, who successfully prosecuted a number of organized crime figures in the Genovese, Colombo and Luchese crime families, will take over from Bob Gorence, an assistant United States attorney in Albuquerque, where the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, will be tried.</p>
        <p>Officials said several weeks ago that Mr. Gorence was being replaced as the lead prosecutor, but they have not said why. Patricia Chavez, a spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Albuquerque, said only that Mr. Gorence would remain one of the prosecutors on the case. Mr. Gorence could not be reached for comment today.</p>
        <p>It is somewhat unusual for the government to switch lead prosecutors so late in a case. Mr. Lee was indicted last December; his trial, which is expected to be highly complex and involve large volumes of classified information on thermonuclear weapons technology, is scheduled for early November.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee is charged with improperly downloading a vast quantity of classified data with the intention of providing it to a foreign country. Although he was investigated for years on suspicion of passing secrets to China, he is not charged with espionage or with actually handing over any classified data to anyone else. Mr. Lee has denied the charges.</p>
        <p>Two important hearings will be held in the coming weeks, and Mr. Lee's lawyers have said they will resist any delays because Mr. Lee is being held in jail without bail.</p>
        <p>A hearing is scheduled for June 7 on the defense's challenge of the original search warrant used to gather evidence from Mr. Lee's home. And the United States district judge overseeing the case, John Edwards Conway, has set June 12 as the date for what could prove to be a crucial hearing: the defense's request that all the classified data Mr. Lee is accused of improperly downloading be admitted as evidence in the trial.</p>
        <p>The defense has said it will try to show that the data was, in most instances, either already available publicly or useless without other codes and equipment. The government is expected to argue that, for national security reasons, the information must be kept confidential.</p>
        <p>If the judge rules that the data is admissible, the government would have to decide whether to allow its release or potentially to drop the charges. If the judge denies the request, it could force a major reconsideration of the defense strategy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stamboulidis recently succeeded in the prosecution of the head of the Republican Party in Suffolk County, John Powell, but does not have extensive experience with national security issues.</p>
        <p>Alan Vinegrad, the chief assistant United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, who supervises Mr. Stamboulidis, said he did not believe that would matter because of Mr. Stamboulidis's extensive trial experience with complex cases.</p>
        <p>''He is a superb prosecutor and trial lawyer,'' Mr. Vinegrad said. ''He's a quick study.''</p>
