        <p>For a city that has prospered as an intermediary between the Chinese economy and the outside world, Hong Kong has lobbied hard to help China win full membership in the world's club of trading nations.</p>
        <p>Now that the United States House of Representatives has voted to give China permanent normal trade status -- bringing normalized trade relations closer and easing China's accession to the World Trade Organization -- Hong Kong has to begin facing the consequences of its successful campaign.</p>
        <p>A China more open to commerce with the outside world, many experts say, will jeopardize Hong Kong's historic role as a trading post.</p>
        <p>''There's no question that companies are going to do business directly with China,'' said Robert C. Broadfoot, the managing director of the Political and Economic Risk Consultancy here. ''It's not a question of if, but when, you're going to have shocks to Hong Kong's role.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Broadfoot contends that in the long run Hong Kong will benefit from China's integration into the global economy as the overall volume of China-related trade grows.</p>
        <p>But in the short term, China's march into the World Trade Organization will pose a thorny challenge. As a former British colony and now a semiautonomous region of China, Hong Kong is a separate trading entity that already has its own membership in the W.T.O.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's stock market reflected this ambivalence, falling slightly today while shares in the mainland Chinese cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen roared ahead.</p>
        <p>In 1998, more than $52 billion worth of goods passed through Hong Kong's port bound for mainland destinations. Mr. Broadfoot estimates that a third of that traffic will disappear after the United States and other countries start shipping directly to mainland ports.</p>
        <p>Likewise in air travel, Hong Kong could lose its role as a gateway to China. As part of the W.T.O. negotiations last year between the United States and China, Beijing agreed to increase the frequency of commercial flights, which would enable more American cities to have more direct flights to mainland Chinese cities.</p>
        <p>That could hurt Dragonair, a Hong Kong carrier that serves many mainland cities. It stands to lose Western passengers who fly to Hong Kong and transfer to planes to popular Chinese destinations like Xian or Guilin.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's position is further threatened by Taiwan, whose new President, Chen Shui-bian, has signaled that he is open to negotiating direct trade links with China. In 1998, Hong Kong's container port handled nearly $10 billion worth of Taiwanese exports bound for China. If Taiwan and China were to break down these barriers, some of that trade would also bypass Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>''Once China gets into the W.T.O., Taiwan would presumably get into the W.T.O. soon as well,'' said Eden Woon, director of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. ''That means that Taiwan would have to deal more directly with China.''</p>
        <p>With all the troubling implications, why did Mr. Woon and other Hong Kong officials push so energetically for the House to pass the bill?</p>
        <p>Part of the reason is political. Beijing has made entry into the trade organization the centerpiece of its economic agenda. In Hong Kong, where politicians and business leaders try to outdo each other to be seen as loyal to the motherland, supporting the trade campaign was a natural.</p>
        <p>Even Martin Lee, Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy leader, traveled to Washington to lobby for the bill. Mr. Lee, a longtime critic of Beijing, said his motives were political rather than economic.</p>
        <p>''I went to support the 1.2 billion people of China, not the Chinese government,'' Mr. Lee said. ''I see in this bill a reasonable possibility that China will change its culture toward observing the rule of law.''</p>
        <p>Other supporters argue that Hong Kong can retain its middleman role -- with a few tweaks -- as a provider of services to the next generation of foreign companies that try to get into China. Hong Kong, with its legions of lawyers, accountants and consultants, is quite likely to remain a valuable guide for those companies.</p>
        <p>''In order to handle all this trade, China will have to have a very well-developed service sector,'' said Victor K. Fung, the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the owner of a trading firm. ''In the short run, it will be very difficult for China to ramp up those services.''</p>
        <p>But some more old-line Hong Kong industries will have to redefine themselves. With the United States set to lift import quotas on Chinese textiles and textile products by 2005, Mr. Woon predicted that many Hong Kong clothing makers would move their factories to the mainland to take advantage of lower production costs. Hong Kong, he suggested, could recast itself as a center for Asian fashion design, rather than a manufacturing center.</p>
        <p>China's entry into the trade organization is also quite likely to deprive Hong Kong of its thriving gray market in goods like oil, cigarettes and agricultural products. Those are smuggled from mainland China by the truckload and exported from Hong Kong so that they will be subject to lower tariffs.</p>
        <p>Despite its expected negative effects on some Hong Kong industries, China's trade campaign has made people here recognize that their economic fortunes are inextricably tied to the mainland. It seemed no coincidence that last week Hong Kong announced a $12 billion expansion of its rail system, including a direct link between central Hong Kong and Shenzhen.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's government estimates that China's joining the W.T.O. would add more than 5 percent to the territory's gross domestic product over the next decade. It also predicts that investment by Hong Kong companies in China will explode. Local companies have already poured in a cumulative $156 billion.</p>
        <p>Because Hong Kong and China would retain separate memberships in the World Trade Organization, officials said Hong Kong would not necessarily gain access to Chinese markets earlier than other countries. But business people here are lobbying for special treatment. Even without it, officials say, Hong Kong will flourish.</p>
        <p>''We do not mind if multinational companies go directly to China,'' the government's chief spokesman, Stephen Lam, said. ''As long as the pie gets bigger, even if we get a smaller piece, it will still be more than enough for us.''</p>
