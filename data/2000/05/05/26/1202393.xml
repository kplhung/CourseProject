        <p>Full-size clay model for final design of new Volkswagen Beetle to be auctioned by Christie's photo (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>PERHAPS you considered buying a New Beetle, but decided the $16,000-and-up car wasn't roomy enough. Now you have a chance to buy one with no inside space at all, at an estimated price of $70,000-plus. Oh, yes: This one doesn't run.</p>
        <p>It is, in fact, a lump of clay with four wheels, a full-size model for the final design of the Volkswagen on the streets.</p>
        <p>The clay model is due to be auctioned on June 8 by Christie's in New York, as part of a sale of 20th century decorative arts called ''Masterworks: 1900-2000.'' The model would seem to be a white elephant in the sale, which includes furniture by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the Scottish architect and designer; a town house at 242 East 52nd Street designed by Philip Johnson, and a prototype of a streamlined pencil sharpener by Raymond Loewy, whose designs included the sleek '53 Studebaker Starliner.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to create a catalog of the best of the 20th century in art and architecture,'' said Lars Rachen, head of Christie's 20th century decorative arts department. ''When we came to the end of the 20th century in developing our wish list, we thought about what really represented the 90's movement of revolutionizing product and brand.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rachen said a life-size clay model elevated the Beetle to the realm of sculpture. He convinced VW, which will reap the proceeds, less Christie's commission, to offer the model for sale.</p>
        <p>Christie's expects the model to sell in a range of $70,000 to $100,000, though Mr. Rachen concedes that there is little basis on which to make estimates. No full-size auto clays are known to have been auctioned, he said. Typically, automakers reuse the clay in other models, or it is destroyed as designers take measurements for molds needed in production. VW's designers provided instructions on how to care for and repair the clay, which will eventually crack.</p>
        <p>The model, of steel, wood and foam covered with modeling clay, is 59 inches tall, 68 inches wide and 161 inches long. It weighs nearly two tons; the wheels turn.</p>
        <p>Freeman Thomas, one of 18 designers on the original New Beetle team, who now heads the design department at DaimlerChrysler, said: ''I'm sure someone would want to have it in their collection. I hope it is bought by someone who will preserve it and appreciate it.''</p>
        <p>But he said it was sad that VW wasn't keeping the model. ''If it were me and I were Volkswagen, I would never, never sell something like that at any price,'' he said. ''It is part of their history.''</p>
        <p>Just as difficult to place an estimate on the worth of the model is to guess who will buy it. Mr. Rechen said he hoped that a museum, perhaps one that specializes in applied arts or design, would bid.</p>
        <p>The model will be on view in the climate-controlled galleries at Christie's, 20 Rockefeller Plaza, starting June 3.</p>
