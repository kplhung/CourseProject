        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A May 24 letter writer takes umbrage at the Simon &amp; Schuster executive who, promoting electronic books, referred to a book as a ''container.'' The writer says the book should be respected as an ''object of value and beauty in itself.''</p>
        <p>The writer might consider the difference between a painting, which embodies art, and a book, which copies it. Destroy the painting and the art is gone; destroy a particular volume and the art is unaffected; an identical replacement sits on the shelf at your local bookstore. So much is reflected in the conventional usage that a writer sells ''copies.''</p>

        <p>As a book collector, I know that copies can be beautifully printed and bound and that one can become attached to these customary physical trappings. But confusing the contents with the container risks missing the advantages that a new delivery system might promise.</p>
        <p>True book lovers will appreciate any system that augments their enjoyment of the art, and there are situations in which the electronic reader does that dramatically.</p>
