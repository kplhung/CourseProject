        <p>A federal judge in Texas undermined the safety of the nation's food supply yesterday by denying the government's authority to enforce critical regulations setting limits on the amount of harmful bacteria in ground beef sold to the public.</p>

        <p>A federal judge in Texas undermined the safety of the nation's food supply yesterday by denying the government's authority to enforce critical regulations setting limits on the amount of harmful bacteria in ground beef sold to the public.</p>
        <p>The case was the first legal test of the Agriculture Department's power under the Federal Meat Inspection Act to rely on new scientific methods, as opposed to the old ''poke and sniff'' tests, to protect consumers from food-borne illness. It arose last year when the department shut down the Supreme Beef Processing plant in Dallas after the plant failed three tests for salmonella contamination over a period of 12 months. The company sued, contending that the government lacked authority to enforce its new regulations, which use excessively high levels of salmonella as an indicator of an unsanitary plant.</p>
        <p>In one sense, yesterday's ruling was not surprising. Judge A. Joe Fish signaled where his sympathies lay last December when he ignored public health concerns and extended an earlier injunction allowing the plant to remain open while the case was being adjudicated. Still, the judge's rejection of the government's use of salmonella sampling to determine the existence of serious sanitation problems at a plant was startling.</p>
        <p>Under the judge's strange reasoning, a plant that produces Supreme Beef's dismal salmonella test results might still be perfectly clean. The judge was troubled by the idea of penalizing a plant when the meat may already have been contaminated when it arrived there. Yet nothing requires a plant to accept dangerous food, and if it does accept bad meat, its grinders will surely become contaminated while processing it, posing a risk of contamination to all other food passing through the grinders. That seems exactly the sort of hazardous condition the statute was intended to remedy.</p>
        <p>As a matter of logic and science, the excessive presence of dangerous salmonella in any meat turned out by a plant should be deemed evidence that conditions at the plant are unsanitary. The vast majority of large beef processors in this country have systems that keep tainted beef out of their plants and are in compliance with the U.S.D.A. salmonella standards, so it is hardly unreasonable to ask Supreme Beef Processing to meet the same salmonella standard.</p>
        <p>The Agriculture Department can be expected to  ask for an expedited appeal of this misguided decision. But Congress could end the controversy by passing legislation affirming the government's power to institute its new system of microbial testing and standards for policing meat safety. It should do so immediately.</p>
