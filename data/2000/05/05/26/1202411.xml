        <p>ISRAEL: JERICHO BAN LIFTED -- Authorities lifted a ban on travel to Palestinian-ruled Jericho imposed a week ago after the firebombing of an Israeli car there. Palestinian authorities said they arrested three men in connection with the attack, which left a 2-year-old girl hospitalized with severe burns. Jericho is heavily dependent on Israeli tourist traffic.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: OPPOSITON'S COURT VICTORY -- The opposition succeeded in a last-ditch attempt to win more time to nominate candidates for parliamentary elections scheduled for June 24-25. The Movement for Democratic Change had taken its case to court, arguing that a postponement was vital if it was to field a full team of candidates in the elections, which could see a real challenge to President Robert Mugabe. The government told the court it had no objection to pushing back the original May 29 closing date.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>GERMANY: CLASH ON SLAVE FUND -- The government rejected a plea from the private sector for state-owned companies to help pay industry's share of the compensation fund for Nazi-era slave laborers. The private sector is $800 million short of collecting its half of the $4.6 billion in payments. According to fund officials, many companies are reluctant to contribute until they receive a guarantee against lawsuits.</p>

        <p>SWITZERLAND: PAYMENT TO JEWS -- Moving to close a painful chapter in its history, government officials met to offer regret and sympathy to an elderly Jewish brother and sister whose parents were gassed by the Nazis after Switzerland expelled the family in World War II. The government agreed to pay Charles and Sabine Sonabend $118,000 in a lawsuit settlement. Bern has never before voluntarily agreed to payments to make up for the deportation of thousands of Jews fleeing Nazi troops.</p>

        <p>FRANCE, SWEDEN: CROP DESTRUCTION -- France and Sweden each ordered farmers to destroy about 1,500 acres of oil rapeseed. The fields were mistakenly planted with some seeds with herbicide resistance created by genetic modification, a technique common in North America but not allowed in Europe. Less than 1 percent of the seeds in each bag were involved, and neither government knows exactly where the fields are, but they hope farmers will cooperate.</p>

        <p>IRELAND: BOMB-MAKING ARREST -- The police found bomb-making chemicals and devices in a Dublin apartment and questioned a man they suspected of being a member of the renegade Real I.R.A. The splinter group was behind the 1998 car-bomb killing of 29 people in Omagh, Northern Ireland, and is opposed to the peace accord facing a critical test in Belfast this weekend. The Ulster Unionists vote tomorrow on whether to accept the Irish Republican Army's offer to permit arms-dump inspections as reason to go back into government with Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political arm.</p>

        <p>CANADA: E. COLI KILLS 4 -- An E. coli bacteria outbreak in Ontario has killed four people, hospitalized four more, and sickened hundreds more in Waterton, a town 100 miles west of Toronto. Dr. Murray McQuigge, the town's medical officer, charged that the local water company knew about the contamination for several days, but did not admit it until Sunday, after the company had changed a chlorination unit.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: BAPTISM DENIED -- Catholic priests in the border city of Mexicali have declined to baptize the son of a young rape victim because her family chose an abortion advocate to be the godmother. The victim, Paulina Ramirez, 14, gave birth on April 14 after authorities in Baja California resisted providing an abortion. Silvia Resendiz, a feminist, said the clergymen urged her to recant her support for abortion rights if she wanted to be the boy's godmother.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: REBEL ULTIMATUM -- The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam set a deadline of today for government troops battling to keep control of the northern Jaffna Peninsula to surrender or face a blood bath. The Voice of Tigers radio said the separatist rebels were near a final assault on the city of Jaffna. Soldiers who surrender will be turned over to the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Tigers said.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: U.N. AIDE KILLED -- Bashir Ahmed, a United Nations field worker, and six of his seven children were killed when the Taliban bombed a town in territory controlled by Ahmed Shah Masood, commander of the northern opposition alliance. ''This is not the first time that indiscriminate aerial bombardment or rocketing has killed Afghan civilians,'' said Erick de Mul, United Nations coordinator for Afghanistan. ''Inflicting such suffering is unconscionable.''</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: NEW SUHARTO PROTEST -- Students threw gaso- line bombs and rocks at policemen guarding the home of former President Suharto, 78, in the latest of almost daily protests to demand that he face immediate trial on corruption charges. The clashes erupted after 200 students tried to march toward Mr. Suharto's house in a rich Jakarta suburb, prompting plans to move him to somewhere easier to protect. The attorney general said Mr. Suharto's case could go to court by August.</p>
