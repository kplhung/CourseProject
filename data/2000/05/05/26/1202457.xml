        <p>Floyd Norris article discusses financial problems of Stephen C Hilbert, former head of Conseco Inc until his ouster last month; notes Hilbert was paid $119 million, not counting his stock options, in 1990's, and $53 million more at time he was dismissed; questions how Hilbert, with earnings of $172 million, could get into financial difficulty that he did; says Hilbert's problems, and consequently those of the company itself, stem from Hilbert's purchases of Conseco stock; says he borrowed $55 million from banks and Conseco to buy shares that are now worth $13 million; stock price graph for years 1900 to 2000 (M)</p>

        <p>SAY this for Stephen C. Hilbert, the master salesman who built Conseco Inc. into a giant insurance company even as critics dismissed it as a house of paper sure to collapse some day: He believed his own sales pitch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hilbert was paid $119 million, not counting stock options, in the 1990's, and $53 million more when he was ousted last month. But both he and Conseco are now scrambling for liquidity as lenders grow nervous.</p>
        <p>The depth of Mr. Hilbert's problems became clear when Conseco reported that he had faced huge margin calls on his stock -- enough to force him to take out an emergency $23 million loan from the company before he got his severance check. Those margin loans are in addition to the $181 million he owes on other loans, either to Conseco or to banks on loans that Conseco guaranteed. The stock he owns is now worth just $43 million.</p>
        <p>How does one man make $172 million and wind up owing far more than that? A lavish lifestyle -- including renting a jumbo jet to fly guests to a party on St. Martin for his sixth wife's 30th birthday -- is only part of the answer. His debt is from buying Conseco stock with borrowed money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hilbert, now 54, built Conseco, based in Carmel, Ind., from a tiny company to a member of the Fortune 500 through acquisitions. A onetime encyclopedia salesman, he became a very prominent man in Indiana, where the Indiana Pacers play at the Conseco Fieldhouse and the Indianapolis Symphony performs at the Hilbert Circle Theater.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hilbert became a hero on Wall Street, too, praised for his skill at cutting costs and delivering profits. ''We have not missed one quarterly earnings number or one revenue target,'' he boasted last fall.</p>
        <p>Along the way there were complaints that he accomplished that with misleading accounting. Four times -- in 1987, 1989-90, 1991-92 and 1994-95 -- the stock lost more than a third of its value, usually as short-sellers ganged up. But each time Conseco rebounded. From going public in 1985 through its 1998 peak, Conseco rose at a compounded annual rate of 47 percent. Since the top, it is down 91 percent.</p>
        <p>Last year the short-sellers were again blasting Conseco, and Mr. Hilbert saw opportunity after the stock price had been cut in half. He borrowed $55 million to buy shares that are now worth $13 million.</p>
        <p>Why did the price fall so far? The last acquisitions, of health care insurers and of Green Tree Financial, a company that finances mobile home purchases, now appear to have been overpriced if not completely foolish. Health insurance profits have plunged, and Conseco is trying to sell the finance company for a fraction of what it paid.</p>
        <p>Meantime, Conseco appears to be desperate for cash. In the first quarter, it gave Lehman Brothers a 5 percent stake in the finance company just for buying some assets for what Conseco's books said they were worth. Conseco says it will have no trouble meeting its obligations, which include $1.5 billion in debt that comes due this year.</p>
        <p>There is no cause for alarm if you believe Conseco's books, but confidence in those numbers has fallen just when banks are becoming more cautious in their lending. Conseco needs to sell the finance operations quickly.</p>
        <p>Conseco will probably survive. But its problems are real, and it is hard to see how the stock can recover enough to salvage the finances of Mr. Hilbert, a salesman who bought when he should have sold. Don't tell that to Mr. Hilbert, however. ''I still,'' he said yesterday, ''have tremendous faith in the people and operations of Conseco.''</p>
