        <p>Letter from Richard Diesing of United Nations Assn, USA, responds to May 22 Op-Ed criticizing UN; says one problem is when peacekeeping force is ordered to enforce peace, without resources or rules of engagement for military action, as in Sierra Leone</p>

        <p>Re ''The U.N.'s Failures Are Everyone's Fault'' (Op-Ed, May 22):</p>
        <p>There is some confusion about the United Nations -- whether it should use force or not, as in Sierra Leone. What began as peacekeeping has turned into peace enforcement, without the resources or rules of engagement for military action. The same troops can't do both. It's becoming a mess, like Bosnia and Somalia.</p>

        <p>Re ''The U.N.'s Failures Are Everyone's Fault'' (Op-Ed, May 22):</p>
        <p>There is some confusion about the United Nations -- whether it should use force or not, as in Sierra Leone. What began as peacekeeping has turned into peace enforcement, without the resources or rules of engagement for military action. The same troops can't do both. It's becoming a mess, like Bosnia and Somalia.</p>
        <p>Some West African countries have committed themselves to return to Sierra Leone to restore the peace again in this country, which calls out for peace enforcement to bring to heel those who have amputated arms and legs beyond counting.</p>
