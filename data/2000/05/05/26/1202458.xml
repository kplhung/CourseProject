        <p>The only sign that hangs in Sarah Fisher's team garage in Gasoline Alley is an 8 1/2-by-11 piece of paper, a list of reminders she printed:</p>
        <p>''1. Patience 2. Focus 3. Relax 4. Smile (You are at Indy.)''</p>
        <p>Oh, that's right. Sometimes, for want of the checkered flag, Fisher has trouble seeing what is in front of her. She is only 19, starting the 84th Indianapolis 500 as the youngest driver in the field of 33 cars on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''That's not hard to do,'' Fisher said, laughing. ''But No. 1 and No. 3 are the hardest.''</p>
        <p>A 5-foot-2-inch perfectionist, Fisher has been in a hurry to win since she was 5, when her father placed her into a quarter-midget car to see if the pedals fit. They do today.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to race at Indy since I was 10 or 12,'' she said, ''but I thought it would take me about five years longer to get here.''</p>
        <p>After a brief but brilliant career racing sprint cars on oval tracks, Fisher will line up Sunday on the inside, seventh row, one back from the two-time champion Al Unser Jr. and directly behind the 1996 winner, Buddy Lazier. In the last row, four behind Fisher, 53-year-old Lyn St. James will be making her seventh start, marking the first time two women will be in the race.</p>
        <p>Fisher is a devotee of mechanical engineering, but not history. She knows that she is the third and youngest woman to race here, yet she groans whenever questioned about her gender. ''I've always been the one to blend in, act like everybody else, be very down to earth,'' she said, her ponytail sticking out from a baseball cap.</p>
        <p>Her team owner, Derrick Walker, describes her as ''the girl next door.''</p>
        <p>''She's retained that all-American quality,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The first woman to race here was Janet Guthrie in 1977. The youngest driver was Josele Garza, who was 19 years 70 days when he raced in 1981; that made Garza 167 days younger than Fisher will be Sunday. Troy Ruttman was 19 years 80 days in 1949.</p>
        <p>Fisher dismisses talk about her gender and her age. ''I'm racing,'' she said. ''I'm having fun. It doesn't matter how old I am, what gender I am. I'm here to be a race car driver, not a woman in racing. You can't be put in a half-million-dollar car going 220 miles an hour just because you're a woman. You have to have skill to do that.''</p>
        <p>Last year, before becoming the youngest driver to pass the qualifying test for the Indy Racing League, Fisher broke the track record at Winchester, Ind., on a high-banked half-mile course that has spooked veteran drivers and spawned the Nascar stars Tony Stewart and Jeff Gordon.</p>
        <p>''She is the real deal,'' Eddie Cheever Jr., who will start at No. 10, said. ''There are a lot of things you need to be a good driver: courage, speed and tenacity. And she has shown to have them all.'' What she needs now is just time and patience, he said.</p>
        <p>Fisher's passion for speed and machines is hereditary. Her father, Dave, a mechanical engineer, raced karts and midget cars for 30 years; her mother, Reba, a teacher, raced karts for 10 years. Her grandmother earned her pilot's license in 1941. Fisher, growing up an only child in Commercial Point, Ohio, near Columbus, came from a can-do family.</p>
        <p>''I have always put her in a situation that's been, I don't want to say above her, but a stretch,'' Dave Fisher said. By the time she was 8, Fisher was winning World Karting Association titles.</p>
        <p>''If you want to be your best, then you have to be with the best,'' her father said.</p>
        <p>Returning from weekend races in high school, Fisher would do her homework on a laptop computer in her family's van after midnight. She graduated from high school with a 4.178 grade-point average, seventh in a class of 178. She decided to delay college last fall at Ohio State, turning down a partial academic scholarship to race full-time.</p>
        <p>In February, she signed with Walker Racing and moved to Indianapolis to be at the shop every day. She lives with her boyfriend, Gary Prall, a mechanic for the Indy Lights Series, whom she met when she was 15. To ease her homesickness, Fisher took her pound dog, Alby, short for Albert Einstein.</p>
        <p>Her team praises Fisher's inquisitiveness and the hands-on approach she learned building cars with her father. ''She wants to know why you're doing this, and she's excited about the technology,'' said Rich Howard, Walker's chief mechanic.</p>
        <p>The only time she tunes out is when people criticize her, which has been rare, with one blatant exception. Last month at Las Vegas, Fisher was running in second place, with Eliseo Salazar in third, when she spun out and the two crashed. Afterward in a television interview, Salazar, who is 44 and has a reputation for crashing, said she had no business racing because she is a woman.</p>
        <p>When Salazar qualified for Indy last weekend, though, he softened his position. ''At 19 years old, I was racing small cars in Chile, and here she is at Indy,'' he said. ''I said things that I regret, but I feel like I helped her a lot because look at all the publicity she's received. I made her famous.''</p>
        <p>Not yet, Fisher and Walker said. ''Let's not get carried away with the novelty of Sarah Fisher the girl,'' Walker said.</p>
        <p>She qualified last Saturday with a four-lap average of 220.237 m.p.h., good for 19th place. She was 25th out of 33 cars in practice today, reaching 211.736 m.p.h. The landscape on race day changes dramatically as 300,000 fans roar along with the engines and the fumes and the traffic, said Walker, who has five victories here as general manager with Team Penske.</p>
        <p>The race on Sunday will test her endurance; it will be her longest race.</p>
        <p>''Finishing the race is No. 1,'' Walker said. ''If she finishes, I think that's a great day, because she's got many years ahead of her.''</p>
        <p>Typically, Fisher is aiming higher. ''I certainly think if we can stay in the lead lap and finish the race, we'll be in the top 10,'' she said. ''I think sometime down the line there will be chances to win; that's my goal.''</p>
