        <p>AS a girl, thinking about what she would be when she grew up, Val Ackerman just assumed she'd be an athletic director.</p>
        <p>After all, her grandfather ran high school and college sports programs  and coached her father's basketball team at Trenton State College. When she was a teenager in Pennington, N.J., playing field hockey, swimming butterfly and freestyle, competing in track and field, and emerging as a star small forward in basketball, her father was her high school's athletic director.</p>
        <p>A self-described tomboy and daddy's girl, Ms. Ackerman, 40, has indeed kept up the family tradition, though in a way she could not have imagined when she was decorating her teenage bedroom with posters of her sports heroes, John Havlicek and Jerry West.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Ackerman has the ultimate athletic director's job, as president of the Women's National Basketball Association, the league she worked exhaustively to create. The W.N.B.A., which expands to 16 teams this year, begins its fourth season Monday in Houston, with the Comets playing the New York Liberty.</p>
        <p>Having been team captain for three years at the University of Virginia and then spending a year on a French team before she went to law school at the University of California at Los Angeles, Ms. Ackerman is also currently the only head of a major professional league who has actually played its sport.</p>
        <p>How many times have you been called intense, Ms. Ackerman?</p>
        <p>That's certainly the impression she conveys, sitting in her Midtown office, speaking in bursts, her lanky limbs perpetually shifting, long fingers gripping, twirling, flipping a basketball, never losing control.</p>
        <p>''About 100 million,'' she says, adding, ''But I'm a nice person, too,'' and blushes, embarrassed at owning up.</p>
        <p>It turns out that despite the magnitude of her accomplishments -- her boss, David Stern, commissioner of the N.B.A., which owns the W.N.B.A., has no trouble giving her most of the credit for what has become the most successful of the 15 efforts to start a professional women's basketball league since 1974 -- Ms. Ackerman has difficulty taking credit for much, unless, like a sports statistic, it is  irrefutable. (''I was the top scorer my sophomore year.'')</p>
        <p>She uses ''we'' a lot as she recalls the early days when, as a lawyer for the N.B.A., she harangued her company and USA Basketball to join forces to build a women's Dream Team, which played together for a year (52-0!) before storming the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. ''We'' dominates the telling of how she persuaded Mr. Stern, team owners, sponsors and networks that plenty of fans -- 2.5 million expected to attend this summer -- believed a women's league was worth shouting about.</p>
        <p>SO why not say ''I,'' Ms. Ackerman? Is she just cautious, mindful of corporate egos?</p>
        <p>The question startles her. Her reticence isn't about being savvy and political, she replies. Instead, she says, what she's gleaned from sports  as a leader of teams rather than, for example, as a golfer, is collaboration. Taking sole credit is anathema.</p>
        <p>''And couldn't some of it be just shyness and modesty?'' she says, flushing.</p>
        <p>Work with us, Ms. Ackerman. What can we say you did?</p>
        <p>She hesitates. ''I helped choose the colors of the W.N.B.A. basketball,'' she offers at last, holding aloft the orange-and-white object in question.</p>
        <p>This is not to say she's a pushover. Ms. Ackerman's league, backed by N.B.A. millions, prevailed even as the rival American Basketball League, which had a winter season, and better-paid and arguably more stellar players, folded in December 1998. (''They were a mom-and-pop operation and made some bad business decisions,'' she says.)</p>
        <p>And she went head-to-head last year with union negotiators for W.N.B.A. players in their first collective bargaining effort. As a former player herself who had become the epitome of management, she grew haggard trying to create a contract that would be fair to her sister athletes even as she had to watch the bottom line of a league that still operates solidly in the red.</p>
        <p>Yet when asked about the dearth of female coaches in the league, the modest salaries and short season, she answers like a careful lawyer, invoking ''the need for patience.''</p>
        <p>What about the May/June swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated for  Women, with a cover showing the W.N.B.A. star Lisa Leslie in a midriff-baring suit? Ms. Ackerman, the mother of two young daughters, mutters something about healthy body images versus objectifying women athletes. She does not look happy.</p>
        <p>She prefers to dwell on the league's accomplishments. Noting that 75 percent of arena fans are female, she says, ''We're not just entertainment.'' The league represents something deeper. She tells a story: in Charlotte, N.C., a 10-year-old girl, wide-eyed, eager, asked for her autograph. A man watched intently. ''You must be the dad, you must be proud,'' Ms. Ackerman said.</p>
        <p>A few days later, he wrote, thanking her. ''He said that at W.N.B.A. games he found time and a way to bond with his daughter,'' Ms. Ackerman says, ''and that becoming a fan of women players had increased her self-esteem. And I thought: 'Whoa! That is overwhelming to me!' ''</p>
        <p>So, Ms. Ackerman, how would you describe your role in women's basketball?</p>
        <p>She grins, shyly. ''I've been a beneficiary of it,'' she says, ''and a catalyst, too.''</p>
