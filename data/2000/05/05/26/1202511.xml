        <p>The Martha Graham Dance Company, a pioneering institution of American modern dance, yesterday pulled out of two major festivals and suspended operations for the foreseeable future because of financial problems.</p>
        <p>The announcement was made after a unanimous vote by the board of the Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance, the umbrella organization for the company, its influential school and its junior troupe. The center, based in Manhattan, would have faced an accumulated deficit of $500,000 if it had continued operations this year.</p>
        <p>''We don't have the funds to go forward today,'' said Francis Mason, the acting chairman of the center's board. ''We continue to seek those funds. This will be a suspension. That's what we're hoping.''</p>
        <p>The company was founded in 1929 by Graham, a prime revolutionary in the arts of the 20th century and the American dancer and choreographer whose name became synonymous with modern dance. Her best-known dances include ''Clytemnestra'' and ''Appalachian Spring,'' but her overall technique and philosophy were more influential on dance and American culture than any single work. She died in 1991 at 96.</p>
        <p>The dance company, the school and the junior troupe will suspend operations today. ''We have to be responsible,'' said Marvin Preston, executive director of the center.</p>
        <p>The suspension will force the immediate cancellation of performances at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., where the company was scheduled to open the season on June 8, and at Kennedy Center in Washington, where it was to have opened a two-week festival, ''The Legacy of Martha Graham and Paul Taylor,'' in September. The company was also scheduled to perform at the Joyce Theater in Chelsea, Manhattan, in November.</p>
        <p>Charles Reinhart, co-director of the American Dance Festival and the dance programming at the Kennedy Center with Stephanie Reinhart, his wife, yesterday described the board's decision as ''totally irresponsible.''</p>
        <p>''You cannot cancel performances you contract for just before they happen,'' Mr. Reinhart said. ''I'm going to try everything possible to make the performances happen. We have no other choice.''</p>
        <p>Financial problems are not uncommon in the world of dance. The suspension of activity also has precedents, among them the temporary disbanding of Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater) in the 1940's and in 1965.</p>
        <p>Since Graham's death, her dance company has been under the artistic direction of Ron Protas, her chosen successor. She left him the rights to her work, and her dances are now licensed by the Martha Graham Trust, which Mr. Protas directs. The trust will continue to operate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Protas, a nondancer, is considered by some in and outside the company to be divisive. But the troupe received positive reviews for its performances under his tenure, and a recent restaging of Graham's ''Diversion of Angels'' for American Ballet Theater was also praised. Mr. Protas said that the Graham dances continued to be licensed and performed by companies, including the Joffrey Ballet in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Mr. Protas agreed to give up the position of artistic director of the company to Janet Eilber, a Graham lead dancer in the 1970's, effective in July. The move was made, he said, to institutionalize the company and to allow him to devote more time to the trust, although he would continue to work with the troupe as an artistic adviser.</p>
        <p>In March, the board voted to remove Mr. Protas as artistic director after he began objecting to Ms. Eilber's appointment. The board was unable to raise money for Ms. Eilber's first-year salary. She proposed to direct the company from Los Angeles, where she lives with her family, with the help of Terese Capucilli and Christine Dakin, senior Graham dancers and associate artistic directors in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Protas retains firm control over the company and school as director of the trust, which gives him the legal responsibility for overseeing the quality of both institutions. He objected to having a long-distance director and said that he felt the appointment had been a mistake.</p>
        <p>Sources in the dance company have said that some government and private donors said they would withhold promised grants until Mr. Protas quit as the company's artistic director, in effect dictating artistic policy.</p>
        <p>''It was clearly implied,'' Mr. Mason said of the reason for withholding the money. But he said that Mr. Protas was voted out because of his sudden change of mind about Ms. Eilber.</p>
        <p>An effort to reinstate Mr. Protas, at a board meeting in late April, was defeated 9 to 5. Five proxy votes in his favor were not allowed.</p>
        <p>''Martha entrusted me with her life and her legacy in her works,'' Mr. Protas said yesterday. ''It is an honor I take seriously. I will always act in a manner she would have done.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, the company sold its major asset, its longtime headquarters on East 63rd Street, to pay off a deficit of $2.4 million. That left the center with almost no capital. The board has been unable to raise money for continuing losses. Plans to move back into headquarters in a new building on the East 63rd Street site were recently canceled because the company had not been able to raise the $150,000 necessary to convert the raw space into studios and offices.</p>
        <p>''The money is not there,'' Mr. Mason said this week. ''I've been to everybody I know who has the resources that will save us between now and the Joyce season.''</p>
        <p>He said that a national tour that had just ended, the company's first in 28 years, added to the deficit. Performing raises money, but it also costs money. Ideally, he said, the company should earn $3.6 million annually through performing and raise an additional $2.4 million.</p>
        <p>''We've been limping along on $2 million or less,'' Mr. Mason said. ''Not performing much. Cutting back. Performing organizations flourish if they make and spend money, not if they tighten their belts.''</p>
        <p>But none of this is new, said Mr. Mason, who joined the Graham board in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>''Since 1989, we have slowly been going broke without realizing it,'' he said. ''We assumed when Martha was alive that everything was going to be all right because everybody was performing and she was there and the money would always come. It was tough raising money for Martha because she was an older person, and people preferred, perhaps, to give to younger people. But once anyone came under her spell, we were in.''</p>
        <p>The three-hour board meeting yesterday was also attended by some dancers, teachers and staff members. ''Some of us are in tears,'' Mr. Mason said, ''and some of us would like to be.''</p>
