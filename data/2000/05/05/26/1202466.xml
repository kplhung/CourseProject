        <p>Armed with what it called new evidence of illegal activity, the city's Consumer Protection Agency argued yesterday for the immediate revocation of the licenses of New York Apple Tours, the bus company accused of repeatedly violating city, state and federal laws.</p>
        <p>But the administrative law judge Judith Gould declined to rule on the matter. Instead, she stopped the hearing until this morning, saying the company had not been given an adequate chance to review the allegations and was faced with documents and evidence so new that some of it had not been seen until the hearing was under way.</p>
        <p>''I don't see that the licensee has had an opportunity to put on a defense here,'' Judge Gould said.</p>
        <p>The hearing, at times dramatic, opened with testimony from Renee Stanley, 47, who said she saw one of the company's double-decker buses strike and kill a 71-year-old pedestrian on Monday, the accident that led to the city's emergency motion to close the company.</p>
        <p>There was also testimony from Robert Grotell, an aide to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who said that a review of passenger stops posted on the Apple Tours Web site revealed that the company claims to make 15 stops that are not authorized by the state.</p>
        <p>The hearing ended with testimony from Thomas Fullington, an assistant director of the State Department of Motor Vehicles, who described scores of possible violations of state bus-driver standards that his office found when it began a preliminary investigation of the company's driver files on Wednesday. Mr. Fullington said the files did not include current driving records and medical examination results for many drivers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fullington also said that a comparison of the state's roster of the company's drivers with a roster obtained by a city subpoena found a large gap: Apple Tours told the state it had 24 drivers, he said, and told the city it had 80.</p>
        <p>''When I saw it, I was really shocked,'' Mr. Fullington said.</p>
        <p>As part of a safety monitoring program, motor carriers like Apple Tours are required to provide the state with files on all of their active drivers. Susan Kassapian, assistant general counsel for the Department of Consumer Affairs, said that the new findings, buttressed by 12 Police Department summonses issued this week to Apple Tours drivers operating buses unlawfully, were grounds to halt the company's operations immediately.</p>
        <p>''The number of discrepancies should indicate to this tribunal, Your Honor, that there is something wrong,'' Ms. Kassapian said.</p>
        <p>The hearing yesterday began 45 minutes after an Apple Tour bus with tourists on board rear-ended a United States Postal Service truck at Fifth Avenue and 28th Street. No one was injured, but the police gave seven summonses to the driver for such violations as a defective rear taillight, no working horn, insufficient air pressure for the brakes and other problems, officials said.</p>
        <p>The hearing was characterized by an unmistakable air of disarray. On a few occasions, journalists covering the hearing wandered behind the judge's bench as she presided over the case. Now and then, reporters bumped lawyers with microphones, even while they were questioning witnesses.</p>
        <p>And Judge Gould seemed frequently surprised by the city's presentation, which was based primarily on documents and a list of witnesses that had been provided to the company as late as Wednesday, and in some cases had not been shared with the company at all.</p>
        <p>Moreover, some of the testimony was not clear. It was not apparent, for instance, if Mr. Fullington's remarks about the company's driver files illustrated poor record-keeping or if they showed that the company had failed to meet state driver-training standards.</p>
        <p>Bruce Paulsen, the lead lawyer for the tour company, objected repeatedly to the details that were the foundation of the city's case, saying their last-minute introduction was a violation of due process. Mr. Paulsen said that a temporary closure would ''put this company out of business.''</p>
        <p>Given the chance, he said, the company ''will debunk much of what has gone on here today.''</p>
        <p>Hayim Grant, president of the company, also said that the city's case was overstated, and that his company was trying to accommodate the demands of the authorities.</p>
        <p>''We are working with every agency to cooperate with their investigation,'' Mr. Grant said. ''We have a professional bus operation and we operate a very important service to visitors of New York.''</p>
        <p>The hearing was attended by a dozen employees of the tour company, who said they would lose their livelihoods if Judge Gould ruled in favor of the city's motion. Luz Herrera, an office clerk who has worked for Apple Tours for eight years, pointed angrily at Ms. Kassapian after the evening recess. ''She will feed us, pay our rent?'' she said. ''No. So we will be here. We will keep coming.''</p>
