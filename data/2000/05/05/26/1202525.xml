        <p>Through June 30</p>
        <p>While he is usually compared to John James Audubon, Walton Ford may be closer in his aspirations to Herman Melville. He wants to create epic adventure narratives that are loaded with real-world information and allegorical significance. This exhibition's main attraction, a life-size watercolor of a rampaging, sexually aroused Indian elephant, has philosophical purposes that could be more persuasively realized, but it is impressive nevertheless.</p>
        <p>The galloping elephant is rendered on 22 separately framed pages assembled into one looming 12-by-18-foot rectangle. Made in a meticulous, old-fashioned linear style on artificially aged paper, the painting looks 150 years old.</p>

        <p>While he is usually compared to John James Audubon, Walton Ford may be closer in his aspirations to Herman Melville. He wants to create epic adventure narratives that are loaded with real-world information and allegorical significance. This exhibition's main attraction, a life-size watercolor of a rampaging, sexually aroused Indian elephant, has philosophical purposes that could be more persuasively realized, but it is impressive nevertheless.</p>
        <p>The galloping elephant is rendered on 22 separately framed pages assembled into one looming 12-by-18-foot rectangle. Made in a meticulous, old-fashioned linear style on artificially aged paper, the painting looks 150 years old.</p>
        <p>Curiously, the elephant has attracted dozens of birds -- owls, starlings, goldfinches, vultures, larks and so on -- painted in a lucid, Audubon-like manner. From a gallery handout one learns that the birds -- all Western species and all associated with ''nila'' or pressure points on the elephant's body used by trainers -- represent Western efforts to colonize India.</p>
        <p>This is interesting but pedantic; one wishes that Mr. Ford had come up with some more vivid metaphors to represent his geopolitical interests.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford's three other watercolors -- 5-by-10-foot images of a lion killing a man, an orangutan with a stolen camera and a buffalo that has survived a forest fire -- also combine powerful graphic impact, faux-antique style and obscurely coded meanings. Inscriptions on the buffalo picture, for example, refer unconvincingly to the destruction of Chechnya.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford may have more to say than his vocabulary permits right now, but his large ambition and undeniable skill make him an artist worth following.</p>
