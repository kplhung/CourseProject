        <p>Ending one of the most rancorous negotiations in the history of cable television, Time Warner Inc. and the Walt Disney Company completed a deal that allows the cable company to continue carrying Disney's ABC television stations for the next six years.</p>
        <p>The Disney stations reach 3.5 million Time Warner Cable customers in seven cities, including New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Both sides called the deal mutually beneficial. But the financial terms were not disclosed and estimates of the value of the deal for Disney varied from $1 billion to $2 billion. Disney executives would only say they were ''happy'' with the terms.</p>
        <p>Executives at America Online and Time Warner acknowledged yesterday that they wanted the cable company to reach a deal as soon as possible, knowing that Time Warner had made a blunder by letting the dispute become so open that it drew unwanted attention to the proposed merger between the companies.</p>
        <p>In return for permission to carry ABC's signals through May 2006, the cable company agreed to convert the Disney Channel by 2003 from a service that viewers have to pay extra for to one that is included in their basic package.</p>
        <p>It will begin carrying Disney's Toon Disney and SoapNet channels on some of its systems and expand its distribution of Disney's ESPN 2 and ESPN Classic sports networks.</p>
        <p>Time Warner also agreed to consider eventually adding two unspecified Disney channels, which are currently under development, to some of its systems.</p>
        <p>At the height of the tensions, Time Warner had said that Disney was demanding unacceptably exorbitant fees for its cable channels, which would have forced Time Warner to significantly raise cable rates.</p>
        <p>Time Warner executives said yesterday that the amount of money that was finally agreed upon was acceptable, that both sides had compromised and that the cable company would not have to significantly raise its rates.</p>
        <p>''It's good for Time Warner, it's good for Disney and it's good for our customers,'' said Ed Adler, a Time Warner spokesman.</p>
        <p>The companies had reached an agreement in principle last week but completed the details late on Wednesday night, after months of fingerpointing and accusations of bad faith. Tensions hit a peak on May 1, when Time Warner halted the programming of the ABC-owned stations for 39 hours and replaced it with a blue screen with the statement, ''Disney Has Taken ABC Away from You.''</p>
        <p>With that move, Time Warner angered its customers, raised concerns among federal lawmakers about its pending merger with America Online and gave Disney a rare chance to publicly play the role of the victim.</p>
        <p>Time Warner did win some concessions of its own. Disney dropped its demand that the company agree not to discriminate against its offerings after its merger with AOL is approved. Disney has expressed fears that the new company will wield too much control over access to both the Internet and cable distribution.</p>
        <p>And Time Warner, which now has long-term deals with all of the major networks, will not have to worry about losing ABC for some time.</p>
        <p>Publicly, Time Warner was maintaining a position of contrition.</p>
        <p>''We regret the way that the dispute unfolded and that it got to a point where consumers were caught in the middle,'' Mr. Adler said. ''We have put this dispute behind us.''</p>
