        <p>Letter from Joan Wile, who participated in Million Mom March, disputes National Rifle Assn's Wayne LaPierre's description of march as 'Gore campaign rally'; says none of people she went with had political agenda</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Wayne LaPierre, the executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, discounted the Million Mom March when he said, ''It wasn't a grass-roots rally but a Gore campaign rally, scripted and coached by the White House'' (news article, May 21).</p>
        <p>As a 68-year-old grandmother who made the difficult trek from New York to Washington and back on May 14 to take part in the march, I am disturbed at that characterization of our efforts. None of the people I went with on the bus -- a group from Nyack, N.Y. -- had any political agenda whatsoever.</p>

        <p>We were a grass-roots group of mothers, grandmothers, children and a few fathers, who were unaffiliated in this instance with any political party or organization. We were motivated by the single issue of gun registration and licensing to protect our children.</p>
