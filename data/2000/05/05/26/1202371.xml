      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Takeshi Kitano, the director of ''Kikujiro,'' has been widely acclaimed for his violent, meditative yakuza (gangster) movies, which explore the bloody deeds and uneasy consciences of members of Japan's legendary criminal underworld, often played, with volcanic charisma, by Mr. Kitano himself using the alias Beat Takeshi. While he's not explicitly a gangster, this film's grumpy, profane title character is another sensitive thug, whose every phrase and gesture jabs like a dirty thumb for the eye of the decorous, repressed, middle-class society he inhabits.</p>
        <p>But ''Kikujiro,'' which was shown at last year's Cannes and Toronto Film Festivals, is something of a departure for Mr. Kitano, if not for his alter ego. It's a sentimental comedy about a troubled child and his unlikely, reluctant adult protector, part of a subgenre that goes back at least to Charlie Chaplin's ''Kid'' and that includes ''Gloria'' (twice), ''Central Station'' and a dozen cornball kiddie road pictures whose names have been mercifully forgotten.</p>

        <p>Takeshi Kitano, the director of ''Kikujiro,'' has been widely acclaimed for his violent, meditative yakuza (gangster) movies, which explore the bloody deeds and uneasy consciences of members of Japan's legendary criminal underworld, often played, with volcanic charisma, by Mr. Kitano himself using the alias Beat Takeshi. While he's not explicitly a gangster, this film's grumpy, profane title character is another sensitive thug, whose every phrase and gesture jabs like a dirty thumb for the eye of the decorous, repressed, middle-class society he inhabits.</p>
        <p>But ''Kikujiro,'' which was shown at last year's Cannes and Toronto Film Festivals, is something of a departure for Mr. Kitano, if not for his alter ego. It's a sentimental comedy about a troubled child and his unlikely, reluctant adult protector, part of a subgenre that goes back at least to Charlie Chaplin's ''Kid'' and that includes ''Gloria'' (twice), ''Central Station'' and a dozen cornball kiddie road pictures whose names have been mercifully forgotten.</p>
        <p>While it doesn't sink to the level of, say, ''Cop and a Half,'' a 1993 Burt Reynolds turkey, ''Kikujiro'' offers little besides its setting that is likely to seem unfamiliar to American viewers. There are some arresting visual touches -- Mr. Kitano is a painter as well as a filmmaker -- and a handful of loose, whimsical scenes. But the movie's humor is dissipated by its slow pace and static scenes, and its emotional payoff is assumed rather than earned.</p>
        <p>Kikujiro, referred to throughout the film simply as ''Mister,'' is a middle-aged layabout whose wife, perhaps to get him out of her way, entrusts him with the care of her friend's young grandson, Masao (Yusuke Sekiguchi), a mopey, moon-faced 9-year-old who longs to find the mother who abandoned him. Mister promises to take him to the beach, but they end up at the bicycle track, where the boy's failure to pick winners provokes his new guardian to sputtering rage.</p>
        <p>Mister's ill temper is matched only by his staggering incompetence. He's a lousy gambler, a worse car thief (he doesn't know how to operate a stick shift) and a disastrous hitchhiker. He tries to stop passing motorists by feigning blindness, and then by laying nails in the middle of the road in the hope of puncturing their tires. When he fails to trick people into doing what he wants, he insults them; and when that doesn't work, he threatens violence.</p>
        <p>In time Mister develops a soft spot for his young charge, and the two set off on a slow journey through the Japanese countryside in search of Masao's mother. Along the way they encounter a collection of misfits and eccentrics, including a pair of sensitive bikers Mister christens Fatso and Baldy (Great Gidayu and Rakkyo Ide) and an itinerant poet (Nezumi Mamura). With Mister in the role of demented camp counselor, they devise impromptu amusements ''for the kid's sake'': swinging from trees, parading around in costumes and playing the Japanese version of Red Light, Green Light.</p>
        <p>Though it generally moves with painful deliberateness, ''Kikujiro'' musters occasional touches of shambling, playful charm. The story is seen through the child's eyes, interspersed with his lurid, stagey dreams and divided into chapters whose titles -- ''Mister Is Strange,'' ''The Scary Man'' -- reflect his innocent, baffled perspective.</p>
        <p>These dreamy touches can't compensate for the film's main flaw, which is that the relationship between the two main characters never really develops, in spite of all the time they spend together. The boy  spends most of the time looking at the ground and frowning, and Beat  Takeshi never lets go of his shtick long enough to let anyone else in.</p>
        <p>''You're just like me, kid,'' he says at the end. But there's no sense that the two have really gotten to know each other, or changed each other, even though the presence of syrupy piano and strings assures us that they must have.</p>
        <p>''Kikujiro'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes some profanity, mild violence and a scene of attempted child molestation.</p>
