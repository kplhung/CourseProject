        <p>Bob Brownlie grew up just a few miles from the campus of Rutgers University, dreaming about pitching for the Scarlet Knights. That dream came true when he passed up a chance to play in the professional ranks or for some of the nation's highly regarded college teams farther from home.</p>
        <p>Now, as the Big East rookie of the year -- he had a 9-0 record in the conference and was 9-1 over all -- Brownlie, a freshman, will find himself pitching in an unlikely position as Rutgers plays host to a National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament regional for the first time.</p>

        <p>Bob Brownlie grew up just a few miles from the campus of Rutgers University, dreaming about pitching for the Scarlet Knights. That dream came true when he passed up a chance to play in the professional ranks or for some of the nation's highly regarded college teams farther from home.</p>
        <p>Now, as the Big East rookie of the year -- he had a 9-0 record in the conference and was 9-1 over all -- Brownlie, a freshman, will find himself pitching in an unlikely position as Rutgers plays host to a National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament regional for the first time.</p>
        <p>Fifty years after the school's only appearance in the College World Series, Rutgers (39-16) will be host of a four-team regional at Yogi Berra Stadium in Little Falls, N.J., opening against Army (24-18-1) at 3:30 today. North Carolina (44-15) and Penn State (41-16) will play at 7:30 p.m., and the teams then pair off tomorrow and Sunday.</p>
        <p>''We are flattered to be in another N.C.A.A. tournament and to be the No. 1 seed in our own regional,'' said Fred Hill, the Rutgers head coach, who is in his 17th season with the Scarlet Knights. ''It's great to bring N.C.A.A. tournament baseball back to the Northeast and it's a credit to the kids and their hard work this season. We aren't going to change things much this weekend. There are four very good teams in this regional and it will be the team that gets good pitching and timely hitting that ends up advancing.''</p>
        <p>Other New Jersey teams in the tournament include Seton Hall, which will open against Wake Forest in Columbia, S.C., in a bracket that includes Liberty and the tournament's top-seeded team, South Carolina; and Princeton, which will play at Houston, the fifth-seeded team in the tournament.</p>
        <p>Brownlie will pitch the first game for Rutgers. A 6-foot right-hander, he hurled a six-hit shutout in the Scarlet Knights' 1-0 victory over Seton Hall to win the Big East tournament and earn him the tournament's most valuable player honors. This all comes after he spent a good amount of his pitching life making the short trip from his home in Edison, N.J., to Rutgers to attend Hill's baseball camp. He was drafted in the 26th round last year by the Colorado Rockies, having dropped that low after making it clear that Rutgers would be his first choice.</p>
        <p>''In a tournament like this, it is very important to win that first game,'' Hill said. ''I'm sure Army is throwing their best pitcher and we plan to do the same. Bobby has been great for us and we hope he can do it again.''</p>
        <p>We expected him to be good, but I don't think anybody expected him to be this good. His composure and mound presence are what separates him from other freshmen.</p>
        <p>Rutgers is ranked No. 15 by Baseball America. The Knights, who set a school record with 39 victories this season, are led by the senior shortstop Darren Fenster, the Big East player of the year and a second-team all-American. He is batting .439. The team's leadoff hitter, David DeJesus, scored 66 runs this season, and Joe B. Cirone led the Big East in batting with a .457 average.</p>
