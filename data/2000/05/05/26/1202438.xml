        <p>As Europe's economies and bloated companies streamline, the Continent has become the latest playground for American leveraged-buyout specialists.</p>
        <p>The cutthroat tactics of the 1980's, with vulture investors searching the landscape for takeover prey, have fallen somewhat out of fashion in the United States. This phenomenon, it turns out, did not die, but migrated across the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>In the thick of this trend is one of the brashest and most feared of the old-style raiders, Asher B. Edelman, who is trying to outwit a venerable French family institution, Taittinger, the Champagne maker, luxury-goods producer and top-of-the-line hotel company.</p>
        <p>But while corporate raiders used to slash and burn in relatively brief battles, Mr. Edelman is conducting a prolonged siege, having stalked the Taittinger family since 1996.</p>
        <p>At one level, the battle has evolved into a clash of personal and corporate styles. Taittinger is represented by its chairman, Claude Taittinger, 72, and his niece Anne-Claire Taittinger, chief executive of the Societe du Louvre, the company that is the main Taittinger asset. They have been scrambling to transform Louvre from a French heirloom into a leaner American-style corporation, and they refuse to deal with Mr. Edelman.</p>
        <p>But they face a formidable foe with potent allies, including the New York investor Guy Wyser-Pratte. Through a combination of legal expertise and sharp financial elbows, Mr. Edelman has been transferring the skills he honed in the United States to pursue Louvre. And Mr. Wyser-Pratte has successfully laid siege to another French institution, Groupe Andre, which owns a Champs-Elysees shoe shop, Chaussures Andre, and the Kookai fashion chain.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Edelman, giving up seems the furthest thing from his mind. ''There's every reason to stay in, and to continue to push for change,'' he said by phone from New York.</p>
        <p>Beyond the clash of French provincial style and American bluntness, larger stakes are in play. As the Andre case showed, old French family companies are under pressure to perform or be taken over. Moreover, the way companies protect themselves is a hot topic of corporate and political debate. Several French companies, like the conglomerate Vivendi and the bank Societe Generale, have recently limited stockholder voting rights, sending minority shareholder groups to the barricades.</p>
        <p>Luxury products are hot now, and the Taittinger properties of Societe du Louvre, like the Hotel de Crillon in Paris and the Baccarat crystal works, are thriving. Mr. Edelman thinks that breaking Louvre into separate companies could vastly enhance its value. But the Taittingers say that a loss of family control would weaken the company's image.</p>
        <p>Early this month, in a Paris court, Mr. Edelman contested the Taittinger family voting rights in Societe du Louvre. A decision is expected early in June. But even if the court rules against him, Mr. Edelman says he will not give up.</p>
        <p>The struggle can be wearing, as each side tries to push on as though the other does not matter. The history of the battle goes like this:</p>
        <p>In 1996, Mr. Edelman began buying shares in Taittinger S.A., the holding company that owns the Champagne maker and more than half the voting rights in Societe du Louvre. He also went after Louvre itself, bringing his holdings and those of his allies to about 25 percent. At a stockholders meeting in 1998, Mr. Edelman's group presented a list of 52 questions about the company's inner workings, including delicate matters like whether family members used company apartments rent-free or held fictitious jobs.</p>
        <p>Such methods, tastelessly aggressive by Taittinger standards, are part of Mr. Edelman's corporate arsenal. In the 80's, he was feared for his assault on companies like Datapoint, a computer concern he took over after a long and bitter battle. By the early 90's, Mr. Edelman, an avid art collector, retired to Switzerland and opened a gallery. His reputation had become one of lavish living more than of financial acumen. In 1996, his sale of a Jasper Johns painting for $3 million drew attention, as had his sale two years earlier, for $5.8 million, of a 23-room Manhattan apartment overlooking the East River.</p>
        <p>But by the mid-90's, he was back at work, running Edelman Value Partners from New York, investing mainly in undervalued French and Swiss stocks.</p>
        <p>Despite the sniping, his continuing struggle has had its playful moments. When Claude Taittinger said in an interview that if the Taittingers wanted to paint the Crillon pink, ''we can, and Mr. Edelman can't,'' Mr. Edelman responded by having a can of pink paint delivered to Mr. Taittinger's home.</p>
        <p>In this spirited give-and-take, Mr. Edelman has been clear about his motives. He says there is great value to be unlocked in Louvre. He wants to shed nonluxury businesses and focus on the Concorde hotel chain and its flagship, the Crillon, where stars and statesmen congregate; the midprice Envergure hotel chain, and a luxury-goods division centered on a revived Baccarat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edelman makes no secret of wanting to ride the wave of demand for luxury. France remains Europe's, and the world's No. 1 tourist destination, and Societe du Louvre's chief luxury hotels, which also include the Hotel de Louvre in Paris and the Martinez in Cannes, are hot properties. Baccarat he sees as a glass company around which to build a luxury-goods group in the style of Louis Vuitton or Gucci.</p>
        <p>''When we first bought in, we thought we would enter into a basic cooperation agreement,'' he said. ''We now see it differently. Whether through a takeover or a proxy fight, in either event we have a plan for three different public companies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyser-Pratte agrees. Societe du Louvre, he said in a telephone interview, is ''highly, highly undervalued,'' adding, ''The value of the assets is two, two and a half times the value of the shares.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Taittinger wants no part of a breakup. ''We have a very great sense of security,'' she said in her office paneled in black wood on the edge of Paris. As for Mr. Edelman's continued pressure, she remarked: ''It's nothing new. There's no rational explanation for it.''</p>
        <p>What she wants is to keep Louvre together, to keep focusing on its main businesses. Over the next five years, she wants to double the number of rooms in the Envergure hotels and to spread into markets like Spain, Italy and Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>Ms. Taittinger, a slight, engaging woman of 50, was educated in sociology and urban studies, and says her passion is urban planning. Asked why she joined Louvre in 1979, she hesitated, but an associate who knows her well said, ''Duty.'' In 1997, after running several divisions, including a line of perfumes and Baccarat, she succeeded her father, Jean, then 70, as chief executive.</p>
        <p>''A family company must be run like a company,'' she said, adding that family-owned companies have it harder in France, where envy of wealth is a national sport, than in Germany or Italy.</p>
        <p>But the Taittingers are not just any family. Nine Taittingers are listed in ''Who's Who in France.'' Ms. Taittinger's father was mayor of Reims and French minister of justice in the 1970's. Her uncle, Pierre-Christian, was a senator; her brother, Jean-Frantz, is a member of Parliament. Yet business has always been the family's inclination. Ms. Taittinger's son recently dropped out of college to join a dot-com company.</p>
        <p>By shedding nonessential businesses like ELM Leblanc, a heating concern, and a controlling share in the private Banque du Louvre, and then sprucing up the perfume and glassware businesses through increased marketing and more closely controlled distribution, Ms. Taittinger raised revenue 10 percent a year, to 677 million euros in 1999, now $617 million. Net profit has risen 52 percent since she took over. Now, Baccarat plans four new stores in the United States, including locations in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Some of the changes, she acknowledges, came partly in response to Mr. Edelman's pressure. ''I have to thank him for the opportunity,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyser-Pratte accuses her of arrogance. ''It's the Marie Antoinette story,'' he said. ''Let them eat cake.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Edelman, for his part, says the improvements are not enough. Claude Taittinger, he said, now brags that Louvre is ''run in the Anglo-Saxon fashion.'' But he added, ''They've been put in a position where they have to run it that way.'' Even with the changes, he said, the hotel chains and luxury-goods businesses have yet to fully exploit the Internet. The company should sell costly hotel buildings, like the Crillon, he says, and concentrate on hotel management. To bolster his arguments, he commissioned a study by Jones Lang LaSalle, the real estate firm.</p>
        <p>''The company is basically un-run,'' he concluded.</p>
        <p>Ms. Taittinger says she does not need the advice. What separates the family from Mr. Edelman, she says, is a question of credibility. ''And then,'' she adds, ''there is Datapoint.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Datapoint stands out as perhaps the muddiest chapter in Mr. Edelman's career as a turnaround artist. Under Mr. Edelman, Datapoint, once a leading-edge producer of computer networking equipment, collapsed, crushed by losses and a series of irregularities. In 1996, when Mr. Edelman was still registered as holding 20 percent of its voting shares, Datapoint settled a lawsuit over a fraudulent Texas land sale after a jury had ordered Datapoint to pay $63 million in penalties.</p>
        <p>Five years earlier, Mr. Edelman agreed to pay almost $437,000 in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had accused him of delaying the disclosure of Datapoint stock purchases.</p>
        <p>But the past does not interest Mr. Edelman. ''If I were to go away,'' he said of Societe du Louvre, ''they would go back to the way they used to run it.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 27, 2000, Saturday  A picture caption in Business Day yesterday about a takeover battle between Societe du Louvre, the main asset of the Taittinger Champagne interests in France, and Asher B.
