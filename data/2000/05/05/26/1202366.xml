        <p>This is a city on second base, wondering if it can make it all the way home.</p>
        <p>The old Philadelphia, which lived on manufacturing and banking and lawyering, ran out of steam a half-century ago. Now the city is betting a billion dollars and more that a new Philadelphia can prosper on history and culture and tourism -- that people will come here not merely for the obligatory visit to the Liberty Bell with the kids but for several days of meetings, music, art, shopping and good food as well.</p>
        <p>An unmistakable new energy has taken hold in Center City, as the locals call downtown Philadelphia. Without losing its civilized manners, the city has begun to bounce after dark; Walnut Street's sidewalks are still crowded at 10 p.m. A Democrat, Ed Rendell, a husky, dynamic former mayor, gets much of the credit for setting the transformation in motion, but the first big payoff is this year's Republican National Convention, opening here on July 31.</p>
        <p>''People at the convention will see signs of a real renaissance in key parts of the city,'' said Senator Arlen Specter, who served as Philadelphia's district attorney before heading to Washington. ''But don't delude yourself: 15 blocks from the center, enormous problems remain.''</p>
        <p>Philadelphia was, of course, America's original convention city, beginning in 1774 with the Continental Congress, which two years later produced the Declaration of Independence. But no major political party has held its quadrennial powwow in the city since 1948, when no fewer than three of them did so (the Democrats, to choose Harry S. Truman; the Republicans, to nominate Thomas E. Dewey, and the Progressives, to name Henry A. Wallace).</p>
        <p>A lot has happened since then, too much of it bad.  Philadelphia lost many of its defining institutions, including The Saturday Evening Post, once the nation's leading magazine; The Bulletin, a powerful and venerable evening newspaper; the Pennsylvania Railroad, one of the first great routes to the West; John Wanamaker's department store, a pioneer of mass merchandising; and the Philadelphia Athletics, who made baseball history under Connie Mack. It had a surly white mayor, Frank Rizzo, whose confrontational approach to blacks was typified by the nightstick he once famously tucked into his cummerbund, and a star-crossed black mayor, W. Wilson Goode, who in 1985 dropped a firebomb on the headquarters of a radical group in his own city.</p>
        <p>In 1976 an outbreak of a mysterious respiratory disease killed 34 members of the American Legion attending a convention here.</p>
        <p>David L. Cohen, a co-chairman of the host committee for the Republican gathering, defined the status quo ante in these words: ''People didn't have low expectations of Philadelphia; they had no expectations of Philadelphia.'' They saw it, he said, as ''an old city, falling apart, dirty and unsafe.''</p>
        <p>A first important step toward recovery was a new convention center, which opened in 1993. Then, in 1996, 548,000 people came to see a Cezanne exhibition at the Museum of Art -- many of them suburbanites who hadn't been downtown in years, many others from New York, Washington and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Local leaders realized that there was big money in culture. Broad Street got a face-lift and a new name, the Avenue of the Arts, and this year steelwork for a new, $245 million Regional Performing Arts Center began rising there. Designed by Rafael Vinoly of New York in emulation of London's 19th-century Crystal Palace, it is scheduled to open in the fall of 2001.</p>
        <p>To house the hoped-for throngs of visitors, 5,000 new hotel rooms have been added in the metropolitan area in four years. Two of the splashiest new hotels and several restaurants have taken over old banks; the metaphor is almost too apt.</p>
        <p>The much-admired PSFS building (the letters stand for Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, though few remember that) is now a Loews hotel, with all its architectural glories, including a polished black granite base that bends around a corner, miraculously intact. Designed by William Lescaze and George Howe in 1932, it was the first International Style skyscraper built in this country, just at the end of the Art Deco era. Soon the old Girard Trust Company, a little Ionic temple with a perfect dome, designed in dazzlingly white Georgia marble by Stanford White, will be a Ritz-Carlton.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia used to concentrate on food that filled big men up fast:  cheese steaks, hoagies, soft pretzels, L. D. Bassett's world-class ice cream, scrapple (a Pennsylvania Dutch blend of cornmeal and unmentionable pig parts), sticky buns and pepper pot soup (a potent brew of honeycomb tripe and hot chilies). Most of the traditional fare can still be found at the Reading Terminal Market (often sold there by Amish or Mennonite women in white gauze caps) or at Bookbinders Seafood House on 15th Street or both.</p>
        <p>Booming (and Shrinking)</p>
        <p>But now the city is a playground for foodies, with heroically hip restaurants opening every month. These are no storefront improvisations; by the end of the year, Neil Stein, who started it all with a place called Striped Bass, will have opened five sophisticated spots at a cost of $10 million. ''I think it will work,'' he told me, ''if the economy holds up.''</p>
        <p>Rick Nichols, who has watched the city's travails for years from various posts at The Philadelphia Inquirer, sounded similarly cautious.</p>
        <p>''The fate of Philadelphia really  hangs in the balance,'' he said. ''Can we live off this culture-dining-service boom, or do we need more lunch-bucket jobs to keep the thing going?''</p>
        <p>Look carefully on the side streets downtown, and you will see vacant shops and even a few vacant buildings. The region's retail nexus is not there but out in the suburbs, at King of Prussia, in a megamall where Hermes and Neiman Marcus and other chic merchants court the carriage trade. Jobs have fled the city, too, as companies like CoreStates Financial and Bell Atlantic have closed or shrunk their Philadelphia offices because of mergers.</p>
        <p>New stadiums for the Phillies and Eagles are all talk and no action, and the ballyhooed DisneyQuest mall is just another hole in the ground, its financing having collapsed. Mr. Rendell, now the Democratic national chairman, must be devastated; the project had so excited him that he told an English visitor, ''To call it virtual reality is to call Michelangelo a house painter.'' The city will now have to make do with a $300 million Family Entertainment Center at Penn's Landing on the Delaware River, featuring a children's museum, an 18-screen multiplex cinema, restaurants and a wide range of shops. Not exactly the sort of thing that brings the Renaissance to mind.</p>
        <p>William P. Hankowsky, Philadelphia's industrial development czar, acknowledged frankly that ''you have two contradictory phenomena here at the same time: Center City is booming, with people moving back downtown, while the population as a whole is still in decline.'' With some exceptions, like Chestnut Hill, the northern, western and southern parts of Philadelphia are worn and worried. Between 1990 and 1998, the city lost 9.4 percent of its population; of the 10 largest cities in the United States, only Detroit and Philadelphia shrank, and Philadelphia shrank more.</p>
        <p>Philadelphians tend to undersell Philadelphia. Is it the Quaker heritage of dour understatement? Or the city's position halfway between the nation's political capital, to the south, and its economic and cultural capital, to the north? Could it possibly be an inferiority complex?</p>
        <p>''Cheering against the home team is a time-honored tradition in Philadelphia,'' wrote the social historian E. Digby Baltzell.</p>
        <p>Whatever the reason, locals have allowed a Philadelphia-born comedian of minimal talent, W. C. Fields, to fasten a joke to their city like a barnacle. Asked what he wanted on his gravestone, the great man is said to have replied, ''On the whole, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.'' That one-liner has been repeated ad nauseam.</p>
        <p>Yet this has always been a richly endowed city, full of distinctive neighborhoods, a center of artistic and intellectual life since the days of Benjamin Franklin and the Peales, much loved by those who live here. The population is less transient than in most large American cities; Philadelphians may flee to the suburbs, but most of them go no farther.</p>
        <p>Whether they call it Philadelphia or Philly, a nickname loved by some and loathed by others, whether they are Rocky Balboas (or Frankie Avalons or Vic Damones) from gritty, Italian-American South Philadelphia or Tracy Lords from the wealthy, pastoral Main Line, they are staunch loyalists.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia story started with that redoubtable Quaker, William Penn, who laid out the city's grid in 1682. It was he, not some latter-day adman, who named it the City of Brotherly Love, and he who gave it many of its characteristics: its respect for education (Temple, Villanova, Haverford, Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr and Drexel, as well as the University of Pennsylvania, with its celebrated Wharton School of Business, carry that tradition forward today); its wide streets and its extensive parks, religious tolerance and closely knit families.</p>
        <p>As usual, Mark Twain got the picture. In Boston, he said, people ask,  ''What does he know?'' In New York they ask, ''How much does he make?'' In Philadelphia, the crucial question is, ''Who were his parents?''</p>
        <p>Some of those families can be frosty, snobby and self-satisfied, their lives consecrated to the First Troop of the Philadelphia City Cavalry, the Merion Cricket Club and the Union League Club (whose brownstone clubhouse bears a plaque celebrating its loyalty to the North in the Civil War). Many live in the western suburbs known as the Main Line because the Pennsylvania railroad connected them on a route running from Philadelphia to Paoli.</p>
        <p>Generations of young college students learned a mnemonic aid to help them find their way home: ''Old maids never wed and have babies,'' for Overbrook, Merion, Narberth, Wynnewood, Ardmore, Haverford,  Bryn Mawr.</p>
        <p>But of course Philadelphia is not all socialites or Quakers or Italian-Americans, and even if the current gamble succeeds, it will not become a tourist target and little else, like Las Vegas or Orlando. Anne d'Harnoncourt, the director of the Museum of Art, New York-bred but devotedly Philadelphian by adoption, calls this ''a city full of nooks and niches.''</p>
        <p>It is not just Rittenhouse Square, the traditional center of patrician Philadelphia, bounded by mismatched buildings that give it visual vigor, used every day by dogs and bums and Frisbee-tossing adolescents and pram-pushing nannies and students from the nearby Curtis Institute of Music, and celebrated for its vitality by no less than Jane Jacobs.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia is also the home of an old and eminent black community, which has produced national leaders like A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., who was a towering presence on the Federal appeals bench; former Congressman William Gray, who now heads the United Negro College Fund; and William Coleman, a former transportation secretary. And it is a river town; the Schuylkill (pronounced SKOO-kul) ) is one of the city's delights, especially on days when it is filled with sculls and eight-oared shells from clubs along its bank. Grace Kelly's father and brother, both named Jack, rowed there and won national titles.</p>
        <p>From Greek Revival to Pop</p>
        <p>The tide of the Revolution flowed through and around Philadelphia.  Washington crossed the Delaware just north of town, lost to the redcoats at Germantown and spent the severe winter of 1777-78 at Valley Forge. But it is in the Old City, in the blocks south of Walnut Street between Second and Sixth Streets, that the drama of those astounding years comes to life.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is, as its promoters say, ''The Most Historic Square Mile in America.'' Few visitors miss the Liberty Bell or Independence Hall, where both the Declaration and the Constitution, those two extraordinary products of Enlightenment genius, were debated and finally approved. Even the history-averse are stirred, though the fabric of the buildings has been mended as often as an old sock.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Franklin was a dominant figure in the life of the city and the young nation, so it seems fitting that he is buried nearby, across the street from the Free Quaker Meeting House. His grave is strewn with coins tossed by tourists mindful of his maxim ''A penny saved is a penny earned''; the site of his house is marked by a steel frame devised by Robert Venturi, a ''skeleton'' of the original, much more evocative than a mere reconstruction.</p>
        <p>But many of the red-brick houses where Washington and Madison and the others lived during the decade from 1790 to 1800, when Philadelphia was the nation's capital, still stand on the cobbled streets, shaded by plane trees, south of the Independence National Historic Park. You can sit in the pews where the Founding Fathers sat (Washington used Pew 58) at Christ Church, whose six-sided, 209-foot steeple, built in 1753 and 1754, was the tallest structure in America for more than a century. Influenced by the work of Gibbs and Wren in London, the church is remarkable for its broad expanses of clear glass.</p>
        <p>Some idea of the wealth of Philadelphia may be gained from late Georgian mansions like Cliveden (1767), in Germantown, and Mount Pleasant (1762), in Fairmount Park, the nation's largest urban park. Cliveden, seat of the Chew family, still contains chairs and a sofa by Thomas Affleck, one of the greatest Colonial furniture makers. At the end of the 18th century, Philadelphia was the leading American city. Once the government left, it never again enjoyed that eminence.</p>
        <p>But it built as if it did. That was the doing mainly of Nicholas Biddle, the city's social, cultural and financial star (and the founder of its most notable dynasty of civic leaders). He returned from a trip to Athens in 1806 with this in his diary: ''The two great truths in the world are the Bible and Grecian architecture.''</p>
        <p>Soon the city was awash in Greek Revival temples, from the Philadelphia Water Works (1819) along the Schuylkill River to Biddle's own magnificent house, Andalusia (1836), high above the east bank of the Delaware, with a grand, six-column-wide portico designed by Thomas U. Walter. The Second Bank of the United States (1819-1824), designed by William Strickland, parts of which literally copied the Parthenon, is the masterpiece of the genre. In this white marble temple, Biddle, the bank's president, fought with Henry Clay against Andrew Jackson for control of the nation's monetary supply, and lost.</p>
        <p>Monuments and Culture</p>
        <p>Ever since Biddle's day, Philadelphia has had a taste for the monumental. A climax of sorts was reached in the exuberant Second Empire City Hall (1872-1901), a hulking, multi-pavilioned mountain of a building topped by a statue of the city's founder, William Penn. The creation of Alexander Milne Calder, Penn stands up there in a broad-brimmed hat, all of 37 feet tall.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Franklin Parkway, the city's ceremonial boulevard, is a Calder-to-Calder-to-Calder triple play. Halfway along its length, one comes to Logan Circle, which was modeled after the Place de la Concorde in Paris; the fountain in the center is by A. M.'s son, Alexander Stirling Calder. At the far end of the parkway, at the top of the steps leading up to the Greek Revival facade of the Museum of Art (remember them from ''Rocky''?), stands a bold red stabile called ''The Eagle,'' by A. S.'s son, Alexander Calder.</p>
        <p>The transitional figure in Philadelphia architecture was Frank Furness, whose taste for the exotic and the eclectic is evident in the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. His enthusiasm for certain kinds of foliate decoration communicated itself to a young draftsman in his office named Louis Sullivan, who returned to Chicago and became a pioneer modernist.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia has had two great latter-day modernists: Louis I. Kahn, whose Richards laboratories at Penn (1960-64) turn the unavoidable technological folderol into crisp design elements, prefiguring the Pompidou Center in Paris, and Mr. Venturi, the father of Pop architecture. For me at least, local buildings by Frank Lloyd Wright (a synagogue in Elkins Park) and Helmut Jahn (the Liberty Place skyscrapers) are less successful.</p>
        <p>The Museum of Art and the Philadelphia Orchestra are both ranked among the top five or six institutions of their kind in the nation.</p>
        <p>Founded exactly 100 years ago, the orchestra is older. Wolfgang Sawallisch, its current music director, surprised many here by presenting its subscribers with a centennial program composed entirely of 20th-century music, from Scriabin and Poulenc to Lutoslawski and Takemitsu. Many of the pieces had been given their American premieres by the orchestra under Eugene Ormandy and Leopold Stokowski, who introduced Stravinsky's ''Rite of Spring'' here in 1922. Joseph H. Kluger, the orchestra's president, said that the programs of more-or-less modern music had given a boost to single-ticket sales, brought the average age of audiences down and provided ''an idea we plan to build on.''</p>
        <p>The orchestra has been housed for years in the Academy of Music, a charming, 143-year-old opera house whose acoustics are poor for symphonic music. Soon the orchestra will be the main tenant in the new arts center, and a new conductor is expected to replace Mr. Sawallisch, who is 76, once the move is made. The move is not without controversy; the old academy may be the city's most beloved building, and neither the Pew nor the Annenberg foundations, two of the city's cultural mainstays, contributed to the new center's cost.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, it will confer at least one indisputable benefit on the city by opening more room at the academy for the Philadelphia Opera, which has made considerable progress under Robert B. Driver, and the Pennsylvania Ballet. Their growth has been stunted by a dearth of free dates there.</p>
        <p>Across from the academy is the Wilma Theater, designed by Hugh Hardy. Two Czech-born directors, Blanka and Jiri Zizka, present works there by David Gow, Tom Stoppard and many others, in productions that are often controversial but very seldom dull.</p>
        <p>A Vast Bastion of Art</p>
        <p>The vast, honey-colored Museum of Art looks as if it had been there for 700 years, not 70. It will soon get an annex -- an Art Deco building across the street, which will provide 100,000 square feet of additional space. Its holdings are enormous, ranging from period rooms (including one by the great Scottish designer Robert Adam) to impressive arrays of armor and Oriental art. It also continues, in the tradition of the Cezanne show, to mount and aggressively promote special shows, though I must confess that I found the current exhibition of 18th-century Roman art a letdown; for me, it's a struggle to accept Pompeo Batoni as a seminal figure among European painters.</p>
        <p>But the museum's permanent painting collections more than make up for that. Its old masters are dominated by the pictures accumulated by John G. Johnson, the prototypical Philadelphia lawyer, who appeared a record 168 times before the Supreme Court. And his pictures (among them arresting works by van Eyck and Giovanni di Paolo) are dominated by the majestic Rogier van der Weyden portrayal of the Crucifixion with the Virgin and St. John the Evangelist.</p>
        <p>The austere figures are shown against brilliant red hangings, the Virgin crumpling in grief, Christ's loincloth lifted by some mysterious force. It is the saddest, greatest painting in the museum and one of the greatest in the United States. I have sat before it a dozen times, always mesmerized.</p>
        <p>In another part of the building are assembled the brilliant, before-their-time collections of Walter and Louise  Arensberg and A. E. Gallatin, notably Miros, Brancusis and Duchamps, including the once-scandalous ''Nude Descending a Staircase.'' At the moment, the modern galleries are being renovated, but that gives visitors a chance to see (and compare) three large-scale masterpieces in one small room: Leger's colorful, mechanistic ''City''; Picasso's ''Three Musicians,'' a pivotal example of Synthetic Cubism; and Cezanne's architectonic yet lyrical ''Large Bathers.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the museum also prides itself on its paintings by local artists, and it would be a mistake to miss Thomas Eakins's ''Concert Singer.'' But a greater Eakins painting, ''The Gross Clinic,'' hangs at Thomas Jefferson University, and others are at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook, where the painter sought solace on Sunday afternoons.</p>
        <p>Art is, in fact, almost omnipresent in and around Philadelphia. In Merion, the truly fabulous Barnes collection (reserve in advance) mixes rustic ironwork with paintings that people travel thousands of miles to see. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts boasts a brilliant American collection, including superb works by Gilbert Stuart, Winslow Homer and all the Peales. The museum at the University of Pennsylvania houses the golden treasures from the ancient Sumerian city of Ur, amid much else. And the Rosenbach Museum and Library contains not only the rare books and manuscripts accumulated by A. S. W. Rosenbach, a scholarly, piratical dealer who helped to build the Folger Library in Washington and the Huntington Library near Los Angeles, but also important antique furniture.</p>
