        <p>Yevgeny Vasilevich Khrunov, an early Russian astronaut who took part in the first linkup of two manned spacecraft high above the earth, has died at the age of 67. In reporting his death from Moscow on Tuesday, the news agency Itar-Tass said that several of his fellow astronauts had gathered on the day of his death to mourn him.</p>
        <p>The date, place and cause of death were not given.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khrunov, then an air force lieutenant colonel and described as the flight's research engineer, was part of the three-man crew that went into space on Jan. 15, 1969, aboard a capsule called Soyuz 5. It was the first Soviet mission to be videotaped and shown on Soviet television promptly after launching, as well as during the mission.</p>
        <p>At an altitude of about 130 miles,  they steered into a coordinated orbit with a single astronaut aboard Soyuz 4. The two craft then maneuvered toward a safe docking.</p>
        <p>Then Colonel Khrunov and a colleague, Aleksei Yeliseyev, a civilian engineer, donned spacesuits and made history by transferring to Soyuz 4 after a one-hour walk in space.</p>
        <p>The two capsules remained linked for four hours before Colonel Khrunov and the other two astronauts aboard Soyuz 4 returned safely to earth. Previously, both the American and Soviet space programs had succeeded only in linking up manned craft with unmanned target vehicles.</p>
        <p>Colonel Khrunov had been a standby in March 1965 for Col. Aleksei A. Leonov, the Soviet astronaut who was the first man to walk in space.</p>
