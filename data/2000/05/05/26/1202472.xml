        <p>Editorial welcomes debate between Gov George W Bush and Vice Pres Al Gore on how best to reduce nuclear arsenal and diminish threat of accidential or intentional nuclear conflict; says placing greater emphasis on defensive systems, as Bush proposes, is alluring, but there are disabling problems with making antimissile shield centerpiece of nuclear strategy; says US should seek to develop limited defensive system, but it must also work with Russia to reopen ABM treaty rather than withdrawing from it</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>It seems fitting that the first presidential campaign of the new century should confront the most dangerous military legacy of the last century, nuclear arms. Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore initiated an important and healthy debate in recent days about how best to reduce nuclear arsenals and diminish the threat of an accidental or intentional nuclear conflict. America's security will be best protected if the next president moves boldly to cut nuclear arms without suddenly overturning the carefully calibrated balance between offensive and defensive weapons that has long been central to preserving the peace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, like Ronald Reagan in the 1980's, is impatient with the balance. The impulse is understandable. The primary deterrent to war is the chilling notion of mutual assured destruction, which requires Washington and Moscow to maintain sufficient nuclear firepower to annihilate one another. That balance of terror has always been unsettling and should be supplanted by a less threatening calculus. Placing a greater emphasis on defensive systems, as Mr. Bush proposes, is alluring.</p>

        <p>It seems fitting that the first presidential campaign of the new century should confront the most dangerous military legacy of the last century, nuclear arms. Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore initiated an important and healthy debate in recent days about how best to reduce nuclear arsenals and diminish the threat of an accidental or intentional nuclear conflict. America's security will be best protected if the next president moves boldly to cut nuclear arms without suddenly overturning the carefully calibrated balance between offensive and defensive weapons that has long been central to preserving the peace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, like Ronald Reagan in the 1980's, is impatient with the balance. The impulse is understandable. The primary deterrent to war is the chilling notion of mutual assured destruction, which requires Washington and Moscow to maintain sufficient nuclear firepower to annihilate one another. That balance of terror has always been unsettling and should be supplanted by a less threatening calculus. Placing a greater emphasis on defensive systems, as Mr. Bush proposes, is alluring.</p>
        <p>But there are disabling problems with Mr. Bush's desire to make an antimissile shield a centerpiece of his nuclear strategy. For one thing, the technology to destroy even a handful of incoming warheads in outer space remains elusive. Intercepting just one warhead has proved difficult in recent tests. For another, an abrupt shift to defensive strategies would invite Moscow to increase its nuclear arsenal to ensure that it could overwhelm even a limited American antimissile system.</p>
        <p>Though such matters of nuclear theology may seem anachronistic eight years after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, they cannot be escaped. Even at a time of cooperation, the United States and Russia possess thousands of nuclear weapons that must be responsibly managed. It is in neither nation's interest to make the other feel less secure.</p>
        <p>But that is just the risk that Mr. Bush takes by emphasizing the immediate development of a robust antimissile defense. Apart from questions of cost and technology -- the United States has already wasted billions of dollars chasing this goal -- Mr. Bush's approach will tempt Washington to break out of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. The pact limits the defensive systems that Washington and Moscow can construct. An American breakout would unravel the arms control work of six presidents, and encourage China to join a new arms race to overcome the shield.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Bush's own arms reduction proposals would be threatened. Many of the ideas he presented this week were constructive and creative. Mr. Bush made clear his commitment to seek deeper cuts than those provided under the last arms reduction treaty. The 1993 agreement requires Washington and Moscow to slash the number of long-range warheads from roughly 6,000 on each side to half that count. Mr. Bush seemed comfortable with eventually leaving each country with 2,000 to 2,500 long-range weapons. Drawing on the positive example his father set as president, Mr. Bush also said he would consider eliminating some American missiles and lowering the alert status of others on his own to encourage Moscow to respond in kind.</p>
        <p>Given the potential threat of a missile attack from rogue nations like North Korea, the United States should be seeking to develop a limited defensive system against such an assault, which the Clinton administration is doing. But Washington must proceed with care by working with Moscow to reopen the ABM treaty rather than withdrawing from it. The next president should avoid reliance on expensive and unworkable antimissile technologies and not take steps that would lead Russia to rearm.</p>
