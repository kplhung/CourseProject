        <p>Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York filed suit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday against an Orange County gallery, accusing it of selling fake artworks over the Internet on the eBay auction site.</p>
        <p>The suit contends that the Antique and Design Center of New Windsor, N.Y., sold numerous paintings in 1999 with forged signatures of well-known artists including Oscar Bluemner, Charles Burchfield and George Luks. In particular, the suit alleges that the gallery, using the Internet name ''sambuca914,'' sold 23 fake paintings at prices from $700 to more than $10,000. The suit was brought on behalf of 23 purchasers all over the country who paid a total of $75,000, but Mr. Spitzer said at a news conference that he believed that many other people had purchased virtually worthless art from the gallery through eBay.</p>

        <p>Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York filed suit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan yesterday against an Orange County gallery, accusing it of selling fake artworks over the Internet on the eBay auction site.</p>
        <p>The suit contends that the Antique and Design Center of New Windsor, N.Y., sold numerous paintings in 1999 with forged signatures of well-known artists including Oscar Bluemner, Charles Burchfield and George Luks. In particular, the suit alleges that the gallery, using the Internet name ''sambuca914,'' sold 23 fake paintings at prices from $700 to more than $10,000. The suit was brought on behalf of 23 purchasers all over the country who paid a total of $75,000, but Mr. Spitzer said at a news conference that he believed that many other people had purchased virtually worthless art from the gallery through eBay.</p>
        <p>''Sambuca914'' is registered on eBay to Jill Schuster, also known as Jill McEwan, the attorney general's office said. The suit says the officers of the gallery, also called the Antique Connection, are Jill Schuster and Jerry Schuster. In 1980 Mr. Schuster was convicted of selling paintings on which he had forged signatures, among other things.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the auction record of ''sambuca914'' listed 39 current auctions and 178 that had ended in the last 30 days. Among the offerings were a painting attributed to ''Granma Moses (Anna Mary Robertson)'' that sold for $2,000 and a lithograph attributed to Fernand Leger that had not yet received a bid. Feedback for ''sambuca914'' -- consumer comments that are supposed to aid other potential buyers -- was overwhelmingly adulatory, with 407 positive statements, 5 neutral ones and 2 negative.</p>
        <p>EBay said yesterday that it had suspended the ''sambuca914'' account pending resolution of the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer's office began investigating the case last fall after a complaint from Michael Ross of St. Louis, who had paid $3,200 for a painting said to be by Joseph Henry Sharp.</p>
        <p>The suit accuses the gallery of continuing to sell fakes after being explicitly told that the paintings were counterfeit. Sometimes, it adds, the gallery refunded money to unhappy purchasers, only to resell the returned works to new buyers without adding any disclaimers.</p>
        <p>In addition to restitution and civil penalties of up to $500 a violation -- the state's maximum penalty for deceptive business practices and false advertising -- the suit asks the court to issue a permanent injunction to prevent the gallery from making further illegal sales and to require the posting of a $150,000 bond.</p>
