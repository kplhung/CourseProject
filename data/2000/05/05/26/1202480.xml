        <p>Adding to the barrage of lawsuits attacking managed care, the California Medical Association yesterday accused three big insurance companies of violating federal antiracketeering laws by coercing doctors and interfering with physician-patient relationships for financial reasons. The California suit was the first broad-based legal assault on managed care by a state medical association, medical officials in several states said.</p>
        <p>The California Medical Association, which says it has 34,000 physician members, filed a civil lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, against the Blue Cross of California unit of WellPoint Health Networks, the HealthNet unit of Foundation Health Systems, and PacifiCare Health Systems. The three investor-owned companies provide coverage for a total of nine million members in California, or about 4 in 10 residents in managed care.</p>

        <p>Adding to the barrage of lawsuits attacking managed care, the California Medical Association yesterday accused three big insurance companies of violating federal antiracketeering laws by coercing doctors and interfering with physician-patient relationships for financial reasons. The California suit was the first broad-based legal assault on managed care by a state medical association, medical officials in several states said.</p>
        <p>The California Medical Association, which says it has 34,000 physician members, filed a civil lawsuit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, against the Blue Cross of California unit of WellPoint Health Networks, the HealthNet unit of Foundation Health Systems, and PacifiCare Health Systems. The three investor-owned companies provide coverage for a total of nine million members in California, or about 4 in 10 residents in managed care.</p>
        <p>The doctors said they had turned to the courts in frustration after negotiations with managed health plans failed to produce the results the doctors wanted. They were seeking higher payments for their services and the ability to make medical decisions with less managed care oversight. ''We got promises, we got intentions but we didn't get definitive results that we could bring back to our physicians,'' said Dr. Marie Kuffner, president of the California Medical Association.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit accuses the health plans of ''using coercive, unfair and fraudulent means to dominate and control physician-patient relationships for their own financial gain, to the detriment of both patients and physicians.''</p>
        <p>The California suit was timed to obtain a seat for the doctors in negotiations over proposals to consolidate two dozen managed care suits across the country. The suits, which were filed over the last year and which are being discussed in federal court in Miami by lawyers for both plaintiffs and defendants, seek class-action status. Almost all of the suits were filed on behalf of patients, not doctors.</p>
        <p>''We cannot continue to allow our patients' health to be jeopardized by corporate greed,'' said Dr. Kuffner, a professor of anesthesiology at the University of California at Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of Health Plans, an insurance company trade group, denounced the lawsuit as ''a shotgun attack on managed care.''</p>
        <p>''There is no evidence to support any of these charges,'' he added. Mr. Zelman said he had recently exchanged letters proposing talks with officials of the medical association.</p>
        <p>Officials of the three companies named in the suits said they were disappointed that the doctors went to court. The suit is ''misguided and it does nobody any real good,'' said Ben Singer, a spokesman for PacifiCare.</p>
        <p>Lisa Kalustian of Foundation said,  ''The only winners will be the attorneys, not the physicians, the patients or our health-care system.''</p>
        <p>Medical society officials in Texas and other states said they helped  plan the California suit. They said they were weighing similar legal actions in their states. ''There are going to be a rash of these suits,'' said James Lane, a health care analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Kim Ross, a vice president of the Texas Medical Association, said, ''California is well suited to have a significant influence on what managed care should look like if the investor-owned companies are pushed aside.''</p>
        <p>Medical societies in New York and Georgia recently filed lawsuits in state courts against insurers on narrower grounds involving payment disputes.</p>
        <p>Last March, the A.M.A. and the New York State Medical Society asked for class-action status in a suit contending violations of state consumer laws. It accused Metropolitan Life Insurance and United Healthcare of basing certain fees on unreliable statistics supplied by the Health Insurance Association of America, a managed care trade group in Washington.</p>
        <p>The American Medical Association said it supported the California society's action.</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts said the California suit could be influential. ''This is the best-organized and best-financed medical group in the country,'' said Todd Richter of Banc of America Securities.</p>
