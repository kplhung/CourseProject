        <p>A pair of mixed-income rental buildings that will offer a total of 222 apartments will soon rise on 10th Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets in the Clinton section of Manhattan, bringing new housing to the far West 50's for the first time in a decade.</p>

        <p>A pair of mixed-income rental buildings that will offer a total of 222 apartments will soon rise on 10th Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets in the Clinton section of Manhattan, bringing new housing to the far West 50's for the first time in a decade.</p>
        <p>The $60 million development, called the Foundry, will have studio, one- and two-bedroom units, with 460 to 1,183 square feet, spread between the two buildings. A 12-story structure with 164 units and 13,500 square feet of ground-floor commercial space will rise at 505 West 54th Street at 10th Avenue, and a six-story building with 58 units will go up at 510 West 55th Street.</p>
        <p>They replace a parking lot and a taxi garage respectively that once stood on the sites, which are in the Clinton urban renewal area, extending from West 50th to 54th Street and from 10th to 11th Avenue.</p>
        <p>Each of the Foundry buildings, which are separated by a five-story co-op at the southwest corner of West 55th Street, will have its own lobby and entrance. Eighty percent of the units will be leased at market rents. The remaining 20 percent will be rented to people with annual incomes of $19,650 to $37,100, depending on family size. The project is being developed by the Gotham Organization of Manhattan, which bought the sites in December from New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development for $8 million.</p>
        <p>''The neighborhood has the potential to be the next TriBeCa,'' said David L. Picket, Gotham's president.</p>
        <p>In exchange for setting aside the units for lower-income residents, the city provided tax-exempt bond financing to the developer, which is also eligible for a 20-year tax abatement from the city. Gotham also secured a letter of credit from Key Bank and is investing some equity into the project, which is to be completed in the summer of 2001.</p>
        <p>The Foundry underscores renewed developer interest in the neighborhood, where the gentrification of the mid-1980's was cut short when that building boom deflated and the economy faltered. There were also concerns from community groups over displacement of residential and commercial tenants in the urban renewal area. Five of the original 12 parcels were developed from 1969 through 1981 into 1,396 mostly low-income housing units, plus Park West High School, according to the city's housing agency.</p>
        <p>But now, with the economy strong, the 42nd Street redevelopment drawing attention to the whole West Side, and commercial tenants venturing into former industrial areas on 10th and 11th Avenues, ''the flow of housing can expand farther west,'' said Brian Edwards, leasing director at the Halstead Property Company, a residential brokerage in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Offices were the wild card,'' added Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a Manhattan rental brokerage and the leasing agent for the Foundry. Younger people who work in the dot-com and Internet businesses moving into the area ''also like the older Midtown neighborhoods,'' she said.</p>
        <p>There is a spate of residential projects planned in the West 50's, mainly on or off Eighth and Ninth Avenues, industry professionals said. ''And we expect more pressure to rezone along 10th Avenue,'' said Katherine Gray, chairwoman of Community Board 4, which guides growth in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>In the Clinton urban renewal area, up to 700 new and renovated mixed-income residences could be developed on the five remaining city-owned sites. The understanding is, Ms. Gray said, that those sites will be developed with a larger percentage of apartments subject to income limits than is the case with the Foundry.</p>
        <p>But the Foundry is the first project to go into construction west of Ninth Avenue in the West 50's. The Gotham Organization, however, built the New Gotham, a 375-unit mixed-income rental building at 520 West 43rd Street between Ninth and Tenth Avenues -- relatively untested terrain when the project was completed three years ago. Now there are other residential buildings under way or planned in the far West 40's.</p>
        <p>The Gotham Organization was selected to develop the two Clinton urban renewal sites because of its work at the New Gotham and ''its responsiveness to community concerns over the impact on the existing corner structure and the design of the new buildings,'' said Christopher J. Cirillo, director of large-scale development for the housing agency.</p>
        <p>The scale as well as the exteriors of the Foundry buildings, which will be clad in red brick and feature oversized windows, will blend with their low-rise neighbors. Most of the apartments at the Foundry will be one-bedrooms and be marketed to the young professionals who work in the area, Mr. Picket, Gotham's president, said. To appeal to those tenants and distinguish the Foundry from its competition, he said, he would do there what worked at the New Gotham -- offer lobbies and common areas with innovative designs.</p>
        <p>Joel Sanders, a Manhattan architect who is also the director of the Parsons School of Design Graduate Program, has given the lobbies an urban pastoral design. The lobby of the taller building, for example, will feature a suspended concrete floor with openings to view a rock garden below as well as concrete furniture that seems to grow from the floor.</p>
        <p>Amenities planned for the buildings include a landscaped terrace and laundry room. The taller building will also house an exercise room and parking for up to 60 cars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edwards, the Halstead leasing director, said rents in the area averaged $41 to $43 a square foot a year, or $2,000 to $2,150 a month for a 600-square-foot one-bedroom apartment.</p>
        <p>Rents at the Foundry, where leasing will begin in March, have not been set. But Mr. Picket said that if rented today, they would lease at $45 to $47 a square foot a year, roughly $2,500 to $2,900 a month, comparable to the rents at the New Gotham.</p>
