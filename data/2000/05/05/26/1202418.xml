        <p>The leaders of the democratic opposition in Serbia are divided about how to respond to the government's seizure of the main opposition television station, undercutting their credibility and damaging the image of unity they are trying to project to voters and the West.</p>
        <p>There are sharp internal arguments about the dangers of confrontation with Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president. Some leaders favor a more systematic program of civil disobedience, including hunger strikes. Others press for a negotiated settlement with Mr. Milosevic that might bring early elections under fairer conditions.</p>
        <p>The seizure of the television station, Studio B (including Radio B2-92's transmission facility in Belgrade), and the continuing attack on the independent print media have also opened new divisions about the wisdom of taking part in local and federal elections when they are called, probably this autumn.</p>
        <p>The smaller parties grouped in the Alliance for Change generally favor going to elections in any conditions. But the largest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic, now says in internal debates that it would be impossible to take part in elections under these conditions, say political leaders who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>In general, these leaders say, Mr. Draskovic -- who had sworn to defend Studio B, which he controlled and which was lavish in its coverage of him and his party -- is opposed to any plan of confrontation that would give Mr. Milosevic a further pretext for a general crackdown. Already, the government says it is drafting a new law on terrorism that could be used to detain individuals for 60 days without charges. It is also drafting a new law banning foreign financing for nongovernmental organizations here, which tend to promote democracy, human rights and civil society.</p>
        <p>The popular student movement, Otpor, or Resistance, is pressing for civil disobedience, including the blocking of roads and a halt to urban services like water, electricity, transport and garbage collection.</p>
        <p>Fearing student unrest, the Government today ordered all universities to end the spring semester on Friday, a week ahead of schedule, and banned student gatherings on campus. In protest, student leaders have called a major rally for Friday.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the week, Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party,  the largest within the Alliance for Change coalition, issued a call for civil disobedience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic is allied to the Alliance but is not a member. He is said to be concerned for two reasons. First, that a tired, depressed, poor population will not follow the political opposition's call to arms, and second, that a growing crisis would favor the Serbian deputy prime minister, Vojislav Seselj, the head of the nationalist Radical Party, while Mr. Draskovic apparently believes that a deal, with Russian pressure, may still be possible with Mr. Milosevic's Socialists.</p>
        <p>But some other leaders believe that Mr. Draskovic is simply afraid to lose control over Belgrade and its lucrative concessions, and that he would rather do a deal with Mr. Milosevic, still hoping to succeed him, than confront him and risk arrest. ''He's trading Studio B for kiosks,'' one leader said bitterly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic, Mr. Djindjic and Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic Party of Serbia, are scheduled to travel to Moscow on Monday to seek Russian support. They intend to ask the Government of President Vladimir V. Putin to press Mr. Milosevic for the return of Studio B and early, democratic elections on all levels, said a Draskovic adviser. Predrag Simic. ''Moscow has leverage over both the regime and the opposition and is in a good position to mediate,'' Mr. Simic said.</p>
        <p>In a meeting on Monday, opposition leaders disagreed even about the wisdom of having the large rally in Belgrade they announced for Saturday. The rally will go ahead, but the opposition leaders say they have no agreed plan of action to announce there.</p>
        <p>''It's the worst of both worlds,'' one leader said. ''Some argued that if we're not willing to fight hard with civil disobedience, using local city councils under our control, then we should just cancel the rally and say so, and then put our resources into preparing for elections. But we're going ahead with the rally with nothing new to say.''</p>
        <p>The problem for the opposition is also its strength. There are 16 leaders from a wide variety of parties of varying size. Inevitably, joint decisions are ''lowest common denominator,'' another leader said.</p>
        <p>But given that Mr. Draskovic controls the largest party, with the most votes, any concerted program of civil disobedience or electioneering is less likely to succeed without him, said a leader of the Alliance for Change.</p>
        <p>Alliance leaders, who generally favor a more robust challenge to the regime and participation in elections under almost any circumstances, are considering whether to distance themselves from Mr. Draskovic. That might help them refurbish their credibility with some in the electorate, but it would also weaken the image of unity that voters, who generally dislike the Milosevic government, find attractive.</p>
        <p>A third opposition group, led by former army generals and government officials who have broken with Mr. Milosevic, is trying to distance itself from the squabbling.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration and the European Union have pressed the opposition to stick together. After last summer's efforts to oust Mr. Milosevic through daily rallies failed -- rallies Mr. Draskovic opposed -- the West came to a consensus that elections were the best way to undermine Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>But the seizure of Studio B and increasing pressure against the independent daily newspapers Blic and Glas Javnosti have made Mr. Draskovic question the idea of taking part in any elections. While such a position could change -- elections haven't been called -- his position is a reversal of 1997, when Mr. Djindjic boycotted Serbian elections against American advice and Mr. Draskovic took part, validating the vote.</p>
        <p>''People have made it clear they don't want civil war,'' said a Draskovic adviser. ''Free and fair elections are the best means to overthrow Milosevic.''</p>
        <p>But one Alliance leader said, ''This is another gift for Milosevic.''</p>
