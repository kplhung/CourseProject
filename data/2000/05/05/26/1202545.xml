        <p>CBS Sports, which has been in and out of boxing for the past decade, will return temporarily in July when it rebroadcasts four Showtime cable fights featuring Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, David Tua and Andrew Golota.</p>
        <p>The CBS-Showtime deal was completed soon after the closing of the merger of CBS and Viacom, the parent company of Showtime, and it will allow CBS to show the four fights in one-hour time slots on July 9, 16 and 22.</p>
        <p>CBS has not scheduled them in any order, but expects the Tyson-Lou Savarese bout, which Showtime will carry on June 24, to be the last one to capitalize on several weeks of promotion. The other fights are: Tua-Obed Sullivan, which will first air on June 3; Holyfield-John Ruiz, which is to air live on June 10; and Golota-Orlen Norris, which Showtime will carry on June 16.</p>
