        <p>Comment on ineffective offensive play by Latrell Sprewell of New York Knickerbockers in final quarter of second playoff game against Indiana Pacers, which Pacers won 88-84 (M)</p>

        <p>For three quarters, Latrell Sprewell's offense has the electric sizzle and glow of a neon sign. Then, somewhere between the third quarter and the fourth, the circuit breaker pops.</p>
        <p>The only things left are empty attempts at the most crucial moments. As Sprewell prepared for tonight's Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals at Indiana's Conseco Fieldhouse, he was confounded at the reason behind his unsettling fourth-quarter performances over the Knicks' previous nine playoff games, when he was 4 for 27 from the field. In the month since he scored 13 of the team's final 17 points in Game 2 of the Knicks' first-round series against Toronto, Sprewell has scored a combined 22 fourth-quarter points. Tonight Sprewell was 0 for 4 from the floor in the fourth quarter, 2 of 2 from the free-throw line. Over all, he was 3 for 14 from the field and finished with 10 points.</p>

        <p>For three quarters, Latrell Sprewell's offense has the electric sizzle and glow of a neon sign. Then, somewhere between the third quarter and the fourth, the circuit breaker pops.</p>
        <p>The only things left are empty attempts at the most crucial moments. As Sprewell prepared for tonight's Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals at Indiana's Conseco Fieldhouse, he was confounded at the reason behind his unsettling fourth-quarter performances over the Knicks' previous nine playoff games, when he was 4 for 27 from the field. In the month since he scored 13 of the team's final 17 points in Game 2 of the Knicks' first-round series against Toronto, Sprewell has scored a combined 22 fourth-quarter points. Tonight Sprewell was 0 for 4 from the floor in the fourth quarter, 2 of 2 from the free-throw line. Over all, he was 3 for 14 from the field and finished with 10 points.</p>
        <p>''The numbers are a concern,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said today before the team's morning shoot-around. ''If one of our best players isn't making shots in the fourth quarter, it's going to have an effect on us. I think he has plenty in the tank. I don't have an answer for it.''</p>
        <p>There are a couple of theories. First, it appears that in each fourth quarter -- all of which have been tight with the exception of Game 2 in Miami and Game 1 in Indiana -- Sprewell tries to do too much with too little lift left in his legs. He likes to take his man hard off the dribble, pull up in the lane or on the baseline, leap and fire from within 10 feet. It is a tough shot. For a player who has averaged 44 minutes a game through the playoffs, it is a shot that requires some explosiveness that may be missing at the end of the game.</p>
        <p>''I'm not finishing strong in the fourth quarter,'' Sprewell said. ''Whatever it is, I really have to concentrate on getting good shots and getting good lift on my shot. I really don't know what it is. I haven't looked at every fourth quarter. But I know lately I haven't played as well as I have at the start of the game. So that's something I'm going to concentrate on.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell added: ''One thing Jeff likes is to give me a little rest early in the fourth. So, usually, I'm on the bench at the start of the fourth. When I get back in, I'm trying to get all loose again and that type of deal. Sometimes, it's hard for me to get the same rhythm going. I'm just going to concentrate on it more after I get that little rest. When I do come back in, I'm just going to try to get back in it and maybe get layups or something easy to help me get going. Hopefully, that will change it.</p>
        <p>''At some point, you need rest. You're out there playing and expending energy. Maybe I'll get a rest early in the third or late in the third. Whatever it is, this way I'll be ready for the fourth. But I really don't want to break the rotation or change anything at this point. For me, really, it's more about me and what I'm doing as opposed to any rotation.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy Calls Fines Lenient</p>
        <p>Jeff Van Gundy was not impressed by the $55,000 in total fines the league handed to the Heat's owner, Micky Arison, and the Miami players Jamal Mashburn and Tim Hardawy for their brazen criticism of the officials after losing Game 7 to the Knicks last Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I just think it is very lenient,'' Van Gundy said before the Knicks played Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against Indiana. ''I understand the disappointment, but to me, I feel for those three guys.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy was referring to the officials Dick Bavetta, Bennett Salvatore and Dan Crawford. All three were under attack in Miami after the Heat players felt cheated out of Game 7 by a series of calls they objected to and some they thought should have been made against the Knicks. Van Gundy did not understand why Indiana's Reggie Miller and Philadelphia's Matt Geiger were fined and suspended during the second round for an on-court altercation last week but certain members of the Heat were able to cast suspicion on the integrity of the game without more repercussions.</p>
        <p>''Miller put a love tap on Geiger and gets a game suspension,'' Van Gundy said. ''Two players and an owner are questioning the basic integrity of the game and get a very, very small fine.''</p>
        <p>The fines were leveled on Wednesday, with the owner, Arison ($25,000) taking the heaviest hit for saying that in Game 7 it was like his team was playing five on eight. Hardaway ($20,000) and Mashburn ($10,000) also implied the officials were part of a conspiracy to advance big-market teams through the playoffs.</p>
