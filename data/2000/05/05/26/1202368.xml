        <p>THE BINDING CHAIR</p>
        <p>Or, a Visit From the Foot Emancipation Society</p>
        <p>By Kathryn Harrison</p>
        <p>312 pages. Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Though Kathryn Harrison's new novel, ''The Binding Chair,'' takes place not in contemporary America but in turn-of-the-century Shanghai, the book recapitulates many of the themes of her controversial 1997 memoir, ''The Kiss.'' In this case, foot binding, the old Chinese custom of mutilating the feet of aristocratic girls, is a kind of metaphor for the child abuse and incest chronicled by Ms. Harrison in that earlier book -- a metaphor for the sort of childhood trauma that persists throughout an individual's life, warping emotional reflexes and leaving behind a permanent sense of otherness and alienation.</p>
        <p>The smell of incense and opium wafts lugubriously through the pages of ''The Binding Chair,'' creating the heavy, sensual atmosphere of an old-fashioned Gothic. Ms. Harrison not only dwells on the painful ritual of foot binding with almost voyeuristic fascination, but she also resorts to contrived plot high jinks and willfully sensational set pieces to move her story along. By book's end, the corpses have piled up with alarming speed: three people die by drowning, two by fire, one by torture and countless others from an epidemic.</p>

        <p>THE BINDING CHAIR</p>
        <p>Or, a Visit From the Foot Emancipation Society</p>
        <p>By Kathryn Harrison</p>
        <p>312 pages. Random House. $24.95.</p>
        <p>Though Kathryn Harrison's new novel, ''The Binding Chair,'' takes place not in contemporary America but in turn-of-the-century Shanghai, the book recapitulates many of the themes of her controversial 1997 memoir, ''The Kiss.'' In this case, foot binding, the old Chinese custom of mutilating the feet of aristocratic girls, is a kind of metaphor for the child abuse and incest chronicled by Ms. Harrison in that earlier book -- a metaphor for the sort of childhood trauma that persists throughout an individual's life, warping emotional reflexes and leaving behind a permanent sense of otherness and alienation.</p>
        <p>The smell of incense and opium wafts lugubriously through the pages of ''The Binding Chair,'' creating the heavy, sensual atmosphere of an old-fashioned Gothic. Ms. Harrison not only dwells on the painful ritual of foot binding with almost voyeuristic fascination, but she also resorts to contrived plot high jinks and willfully sensational set pieces to move her story along. By book's end, the corpses have piled up with alarming speed: three people die by drowning, two by fire, one by torture and countless others from an epidemic.</p>
        <p>And yet for all these melodramatic excesses, ''The Binding Chair'' never devolves into simple soap opera. Ms. Harrison writes with such assurance, such matter-of-fact sympathy for her characters, that readers are slowly but surely induced to succumb to the spell of her hothouse world.</p>
        <p>As in her last historical novel, ''Poison'' (1995), Ms. Harrison tells the overlapping stories of two women whose lives mirror and counterpoint each other's. The first woman, May, was born to privilege and wealth, and her feet were painfully bound when she was 5. After a nightmarish marriage to a sadistic man, May runs away to Shanghai, where she spends seven years working in a brothel. There she meets the man she will marry, a good-natured do-gooder named Arthur Cohen who invites her into the fold of his expatriate family.</p>
        <p>Just as he believes that his quixotic plans for reform (registering prostitutes, regulating surgery and inveighing against pornography) can transform Shanghai into a more humane city, so Arthur believes that he can save May from her past. After their only child, Rose, dies in a boating accident, however, May slips further into her opium habit, escaping into a dream world where memory can be blurred if not erased.</p>
        <p>The second woman to hold center stage in Ms. Harrison's novel is May's niece, Alice Benjamin, the daughter of Arthur's high-strung sister. Alice is a bright, rebellious girl who shares her aunt's defiance of authority: she gets herself expelled from boarding school and allows herself to be abducted from a train by a Russian Army engineer. May sees Alice as a substitute for her lost daughter and tries to adopt Alice as her own, an act that ultimately estranges the two women.</p>
        <p>Cutting back and forth between Alice's story and May's, Ms. Harrison conjures up the vanished world of early-20th-century Shanghai, a world in which women are brought up to please and service men, a world in which class and sex determine one's fate. Although May tries to escape her destiny and though she eventually flees to the south of France with Arthur's family, her damaged feet are a constant reminder that she comes ''from another world.'' She is scornful of Alice's efforts to get her medical help, impatient with others' efforts to make her fit in. Her one passion becomes swimming -- an activity where she can ''move unhindered by her feet,'' travel ''without help, as fast and as gracefully as any other person.''</p>
        <p>Among the people Alice and May cross paths with are a motley assortment of eccentrics, misfits and fellow outsiders. There's Captain Litovsky, the Russian engineer who tries to kidnap Alice during a long train trip across Siberia. There's Suzanne Petrovna, a penniless translator and editor who flees to the south of France to escape her abusive father. And there's Eleanor Clusburtson, a former math teacher whose mishap with a false tooth unexpectedly helps Alice's father corner the lucrative Chinese rubber market.</p>
        <p>Though Ms. Harrison's orchestration of these people's intersecting lives is clumsily stage-managed, her evocation of May's life is persuasive enough to make the reader overlook such missteps. Indeed, ''The Binding Chair'' ratifies the notion that a gifted writer can take seemingly lurid subject matter and a tricked-up plot and transform them through emotional insight and plain old storytelling verve into an involving work of fiction.</p>
