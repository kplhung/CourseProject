        <p>Offering the most detailed catalog yet of the Pirro family's finances, a former secretary to Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester district attorney, testified today that Ms. Pirro regularly routed household bills to the office of her husband, so that some of those bills would be paid with corporate checks.</p>
        <p>In this closely watched and politically charged federal tax-fraud trial, Ms. Pirro's husband, Albert J. Pirro Jr., and his brother, Anthony G. Pirro, are accused of improperly deducting more than $1.2 million in personal expenses as business write-offs between 1988 and 1997.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pirro has not been charged with any wrongdoing. But today's testimony was the closest that the federal government has come to suggesting that she was not exactly in the dark about how her husband handled the family's books.</p>
        <p>The former secretary, Dolores Uben, noted that Ms. Pirro was usually quite conscientious about using her personal checkbook to pay for personal items like groceries, dry cleaning and doctor's bills -- even using her own stamps to mail out the checks. At the same time, though, Ms. Pirro forwarded her family's utility bills and expenses for her cable television show, which her husband produced, to Marie Tedeschi, Mr. Pirro's bookkeeper, knowing full well that those bills would be paid by one of her husband's myriad companies.</p>
        <p>''When I received the bill from Judge Pirro,'' said Mrs. Uben, referring to Ms. Pirro's earlier tenure as a Westchester County judge, ''she said, 'Send it to Al and ask Marie what company to pay it from.' ''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Uben's revelations capped the sixth day of the trial of Mr. Pirro, Westchester's most prominent real estate development lawyer and a powerful Republican fund-raiser, whose wife's political prospects have been at least temporarily derailed by this trial.</p>
        <p>Bennett L. Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School who has attended most of the proceedings and has often been critical of the Pirros, said after today's session that it appeared that Ms. Pirro knew more about her family's finances than she had let on.</p>
        <p>''I think it shows that she's in the front, and he's in the background, behind the scenes, making the decisions as to how to allocate these expenses,'' he said. ''I think it's pretty clear that she had some knowledge, and maybe some culpability, though clearly not enough to warrant charging her.''</p>
        <p>So far in the trial, federal prosecutors have tried to cobble together a picture of a family that spent lavishly on art, cars and home-improvement projects and was headed by a ''shrewd, experienced businessman'' -- as they have labeled Albert Pirro -- who used his various corporate accounts to pay those personal expenses.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, most of the testimony centered on the Pirros' art purchases; today, it was expensive cars and fine cigars. For instance, Werner L. Pfister, a car salesman in Greenwich, Conn., recalled that Mr. Pirro traded in a 1961 Corvette and a 1984 Ferrari for a 1994 Ferrari 348 Spider that cost $123,000 -- a car that prosecutors say was bought by one of Mr. Pirro's companies and illegally deducted as a business expense.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mrs. Uben portrayed Ms. Pirro as extremely sensitive to what constituted a personal expense to be paid out of her own checkbook, and what should be forwarded to her husband as a corporate expense. On cross-examination, Mrs. Uben said that the only reason Ms. Pirro received the Con Edison bill for their home at her office before forwarding it to her husband's office was that Mr. Pirro ''wasn't very good about paying the bills'' and ''it was a point of contention'' between the two.</p>
        <p>As for the cable television program ''Judge Pirro Reports,'' Mrs. Uben and another witness, Sunny McLean, testified that Mr. Pirro -- the program's executive producer -- had paid for production costs, videotapes and assorted other program expenses with checks from one of his companies, AJP Management Group. One invoice, for $436.67, even had a handwritten note from Ms. Pirro to her husband: ''Al, please pay, Love, Jeanine.''</p>
