        <p>In a signal that there may be some easing in the 18-month-long impasse between New York and New Jersey that has blocked approval of major Port Authority projects, the agency's commissioners unanimously adopted an annual budget yesterday.</p>
        <p>The $3.9 billion spending plan for 2000 had been stalled for months because of the dispute. But approval came swiftly and without debate yesterday at the monthly meeting of the authority's 12-member board.</p>
        <p>The document is a rough outline of agency expenses and expected capital spending for the year. Most major projects still must be individually approved by a vote of the commissioners.</p>
        <p>The budget includes a record $1.54 billion in capital spending, much of it earmarked for work on the Air Train project connecting subway and Long Island Rail Road lines to Kennedy International Airport, and for the monorail connecting Newark International Airport to a new rail terminal on the Amtrak and New Jersey Transit commuter lines.</p>
        <p>Not included in the spending plan was authorization for a new 30-year lease to the Maersk Sealand container shipping company that would house its major East Coast terminal in expanded and improved quarters at the Elizabeth Marine Terminal in New Jersey. Gov. George E. Pataki of New York has maintained that the lease would be a huge subsidy benefiting New Jersey alone, and would continue an imbalance in Port Authority capital spending.</p>
        <p>Also missing from the budget was any action advancing two initiatives favored by New York: the leasing of air rights over the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and the solicitation of proposals to privatize or sell the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who rejects the argument that the agency's spending favors her state, has argued that New York's opposition is jeopardizing a  measure that will keep the New York area's ports competitive. She has  directed the six New Jersey commissioners to approve the two measures favored by New York only when they are included as a package with the Maersk Sealand lease.</p>
        <p>The two governors have resisted calls from newspaper editorial boards and former New York and New Jersey governors that they meet to resolve the impasse.</p>
        <p>A month ago, an agreement to pass the budget collapsed at the last minute when New York commissioners insisted that they had problems with the implications of the plan over the next five years.</p>
        <p>But yesterday Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority and the chief New York representative, said that those concerns had been addressed and that progress was being made in ending the larger impasse.</p>
        <p>''We are talking about resolving the problems,'' said Mr. Gargano, noting that he had talked almost daily with Lewis M. Eisenberg, the agency's chairman and its chief New Jersey negotiator. ''But we are not at the point yet where the two governors will meet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisenberg echoed that view, adding that he and Mr. Gargano were working on a proposal acceptable to both states. While neither  would describe the proposal, advisers to the governors in both Trenton and Albany said that they are considering creating a pool of money -- as much as $400 million -- to be divided between the states for new projects, with New York getting the larger share.</p>
