        <p>In her first public appearance since her recent libel case victory against a British writer who has denied the Holocaust, Deborah E. Lipstadt told the graduating class of Yeshiva University yesterday that her decision to fight her legal battle was similar to the decisions made by gentiles who rescued Jews during World War II.</p>
        <p>''I never decided to fight -- not fighting was never an option,'' Dr. Lipstadt, a renowned scholar of the Holocaust who runs the Institute for Jewish Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, said during Yeshiva's commencement ceremonies in an auditorium at Madison Square Garden. Similarly, she said, when she has asked the rescuers when they decided to rescue Jews, they are befuddled ''because they never decided.''</p>

        <p>In her first public appearance since her recent libel case victory against a British writer who has denied the Holocaust, Deborah E. Lipstadt told the graduating class of Yeshiva University yesterday that her decision to fight her legal battle was similar to the decisions made by gentiles who rescued Jews during World War II.</p>
        <p>''I never decided to fight -- not fighting was never an option,'' Dr. Lipstadt, a renowned scholar of the Holocaust who runs the Institute for Jewish Studies at Emory University in Atlanta, said during Yeshiva's commencement ceremonies in an auditorium at Madison Square Garden. Similarly, she said, when she has asked the rescuers when they decided to rescue Jews, they are befuddled ''because they never decided.''</p>
        <p>''In both cases, the alternative, letting the scoundrels do their evil deeds, was simply unpalatable,'' Dr. Lipstadt said. ''With pure evil, there can be no compromise.''</p>
        <p>The celebration seemed as much about Dr. Lipstadt's success in April, in a libel case filed in a British court, as about the achievement of the 2,049 students who had earned associate's, bachelor's, master's, professional and doctoral degrees. In that case, Dr. Lipstadt successfully defended herself against a claim by David Irving, a British writer, that her book ''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory,'' had damaged his reputation. Yesterday, Dr. Lipstadt was welcomed with a solemn standing ovation and, upon receiving an honorary doctorate of humane letters, was compared in heroism to the biblical Deborah.</p>
        <p>After her speech, the ceremony turned to typical commencement high jinks. Students, particularly the male undergraduates, punctuated the diploma-collection parade with boisterous cheers, including rounds of The Wave and shouts of ''de-fense'' befitting the location. They tossed paper airplanes and bounced big plastic beach balls, as parents, grandparents and spouses watched through video cameras.</p>
        <p>''I'll hold up these proceedings until that ball is taken out of here,'' Norman Lamm, the university's president, warned from the podium. The ball was removed, to loud boos, but was soon replaced with another. And another.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lamm gave his own commencement address in Hebrew, telling students that their character is more important than any academic achievement. Five of the Ten Commandments concern acts between neighbors, he noted, urging them to live lives guided by derech eretz, or civilized behavior.</p>
        <p>Among the valedictorians was Salim Baghdadi, an immigrant from Syria who did not even speak English when he arrived in this country four years ago. Mr. Baghdadi received four major awards, including prizes in Bible and chemistry, and one ''for a worthy student.''</p>
        <p>In addition to Dr. Lipstadt, Yeshiva, the nation's oldest and most comprehensive Jewish university, granted honorary degrees to Gunter Blobel, winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize for Medicine, and Azriel Rosenfeld, who has five Yeshiva degrees and is a leader in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lipstadt read letters she received from supporters, including children of Holocaust victims and survivors, after her court victory. Using stories from the Talmud, she urged the graduates to surround themselves with a community of like-minded people to support them in their struggles.</p>
        <p>''Your teachers hope that, as you go forth from the gates of this institution and as you encounter challenges in life, you will not compromise your principles just because it is easier to do so,'' she said. ''They hope that you will know that while you cannot fight every battle, there is a line you will not cross, that you will stand up for what is right, even when it demands much of you to do so.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 27, 2000, Saturday  An article yesterday about Yeshiva University's commencement included an erroneous reference from the university to the appearance of Dr. Deborah E. Lipstadt, a historian of the Holocaust who received an honorary doctorate. This was not her first public appearance since her victory in April in a libel suit against a British writer who has denied the Holocaust. Dr. Lipstadt spoke earlier in May at the American Jewish Committee meeting in Washington.</p>
