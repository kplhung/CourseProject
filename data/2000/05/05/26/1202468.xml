        <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court declared today that the state was responsible for all of the costs of construction for poor school districts under the court's 1998 school finance ruling, not just a portion of them.</p>
        <p>Today's decision was a setback for the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, and a victory for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Mr. Collins's likely opponent for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Senate president. Governor Whitman cannot run for re-election because of term limits.</p>

        <p>The New Jersey Supreme Court declared today that the state was responsible for all of the costs of construction for poor school districts under the court's 1998 school finance ruling, not just a portion of them.</p>
        <p>Today's decision was a setback for the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, and a victory for Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Mr. Collins's likely opponent for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Senate president. Governor Whitman cannot run for re-election because of term limits.</p>
        <p>The ruling was a clarification of the court's 1998 decision, which held the state responsible for bringing poor, mostly urban, school district buildings up to state standards. The cost has been estimated at about $15 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins has introduced legislation that commits the state to pay for classrooms but leaves the costs of what he called extras, like cafeterias and media rooms, entirely or partly up to the 30 designated poor districts. They are known as Abbott districts after the original lawsuit, Abbott v. Burke. That action was brought by parents of children in poorly financed areas, who said low per-child spending in their districts violated the state constitution's guarantee of a complete public education.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco and Mrs. Whitman favored legislation that committed the state to pay all costs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins asked the court to take the unusual step of clarifying its own words, and the court agreed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins said he would accept the court's position, even though he thought it infringed on the Legislature's authority to allocate money.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiFrancesco said he was pleased that his view had prevailed.</p>
