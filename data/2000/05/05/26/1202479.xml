        <p>Over the past two weeks, both teams have .500 records. Both have played inconsistently.

        <p>Over the past two weeks, both teams have .500 records. Both have played inconsistently. Both have been overlooked, even in their own sport, because the other conference finals series is more glamorous. Both have frustrated their fans with lapses on defense and with missed opportunities on offense. So what is the big deal about the Devils playing the Flyers tonight in Philadelphia?</p>
        <p>It is significant for more than just the right to meet the Western winner next week in the Stanley Cup finals. The victor in Game 7 between the Devils and the Flyers tonight will be a deserving survivor of these rugged and harrowing Eastern finals. The players who prevail will have earned the right to advance and the honor of having beaten a worthy foe.</p>
        <p>Consider, for instance, the 39 stitches needed to close the cuts on the face of Philadelphia's John LeClair and the 40-stitch gash on the face of the Devils' Sergei Nemchinov. Both of these bloody injuries, by the way, were accidental. Elsewhere, the desire is evident when you see John Madden of the Devils, a rookie of modest size, returning unexpectedly early from a knee injury to cover Eric Lindros of the Flyers, a huge veteran who returned unexpectedly early from post-concussion symptoms.</p>
        <p>There have been other cuts to skin and blows to heads and bumps to limbs but remarkably few penalties and only one fight. Despite occasional trash talk -- thank you, Claude Lemieux -- you get the feeling that both of these evenly matched teams respect each other's grit and harbor antagonism that is mostly professional. Of course, this does not stop them from hacking and whacking one another with gleeful abandon during line changes.</p>
        <p>In goal, the contrast was startling early in the series when Brian Boucher, the Flyers rookie, outplayed Martin Brodeur, the Devils veteran. Boucher has continued to play well during the last two games, both Devils victories. But they are starting to put pucks behind him, off his goal posts, and even stuck one slap shot into his mask Wednesday night. And Boucher has been showing more emotion lately, some anger and frustration. How will he handle the pressure of Game 7, when Philadelphia fans will demand the best and fear the worst?</p>
        <p>Brodeur could have disintegrated emotionally after all those soft goals, fat rebounds and turnovers of the early games. But he stayed calm, accepted criticism and coaching and stabilized both his performance level and his team's confidence. The day after Game 3, when he was asked whether he could wash such a poor showing out of his hair, Brodeur smiled, fingered a short strand on his head and said, ''Just got it cut.''</p>
        <p>Behind the benches, both coaches have similar histories this season and have had different results this series with lineup changes. Philadelphia's Craig Ramsay, an assistant who replaced Roger Neilson because of Neilson's illness, had to accommodate the presence of Lindros for Game 6. It may not be Ramsay's fault that LeClair, Mark Recchi and Rick Tocchet followed with their least effective efforts of the series. But Ramsay will need more from them in Game 7 to advance.</p>
        <p>Larry Robinson, who replaced the fired Robbie Ftorek as the Devils coach, provided a jolt of energy when he kicked over a trash can and yelled at his players after they fell behind by three games to one. Unanimously, they say his dressing-room speech sparked their turnabout.</p>
        <p>More quietly, Robinson has adjusted personnel, moving Randy McKay off Bobby Holik's line and replacing him with Lemieux. When Nemchinov left Game 5 with his injury, Robinson moved Sergei Brylin from Holik's line to a combination with Scott Gomez and Alexander Mogilny. Both moves made both lines better.</p>
        <p>Close to his players, Robinson seems to have a feel for their personalities and motivational triggers. When Gomez slumped early in the tournament, Robinson inspired him by threatening to bench him. When Scott Niedermayer was less than impressive in this round, Robinson told reporters that the underachieving defenseman might be nervous. Niedermayer responded with a strong effort.</p>
        <p>When Mogilny struggled for a goal and missed on several good chances Wednesday night, Robinson kept sending him out. Mogilny responded with the game-winning goal. When Mogilny came back to the bench, the coach congratulated him by grabbing him around the neck with both hands and shaking hard.</p>
        <p>Fittingly, the finale between these two East Coast rivals takes place at the beginning of the first holiday weekend of the summer season, when motorists from both areas jam the Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway and head for the Jersey Shore. For one of these teams, a three-month vacation begins tonight. For either team, a berth in the finals or a long rest and recuperation will be well earned. When they part at the post-game handshake line, their audience should give both sides a hand.</p>
