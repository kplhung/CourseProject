        <p>He's an enigma and an All-Star, a technical foul waiting to happen and a highlight film ready to roll. In two mood swings so far, Rasheed Wallace has proved himself as the Western Conference finals' wild card, capable of upsetting his own team's chemistry or personally escorting the Los Angeles Lakers to the express-checkout lane.</p>
        <p>Playing only 16 minutes in Game 1 last Saturday, Wallace was the Portland Trail Blazers' biggest asset and liability, scoring 11 points and being ejected for a menacing stare-down of the official Ron Garretson. Portland lost by 15 points.</p>
        <p>In Game 2 on Monday, Wallace suddenly became his own anger-management counselor, played 46 of 48 minutes and strafed the Lakers for 29 points and 12 rebounds. He hit all three of his 3-point attempts in the decisive third quarter and Portland won by 29 points.</p>
        <p>''That's the way everybody would love to see Rasheed play -- including myself,'' the Blazers' Scottie Pippen said.</p>
        <p>So, which Wallace will show up for Game 3 on Friday night at the Rose Garden? The rage? Or the fury?</p>
        <p>His teammates are confident Wallace, who is in his fifth professional season, has replaced his short regular-season fuse with a mature playoff cool. The power of peer pressure in the Trail Blazers' locker room after Game 1 certainly helped promote a change in his attitude.</p>
        <p>''He might not have said it to anybody, but I know he was real frustrated about the other day,'' the Portland guard Bonzi Wells said. ''Like he let everybody down.''</p>
        <p>With the home crowd serving as Wallace's support group for the next two games, the Lakers could again find themselves under extreme frontcourt pressure. A focused Wallace can resemble Pippen in his quickness and sleight of hand, appearing to be constantly open on offense and everywhere on defense.</p>
        <p>''He's a tough match,'' said Portland's Greg Anthony, the former Knick, who like Wallace struggled early in his career to find the proper mix of emotion and intensity in his game. ''When he stays under control and plays the way he did, it really bodes well for us.</p>
        <p>''You want to have a happy medium there. The best way to develop that is with experience and over time. That's something Rasheed is doing a pretty good job of. Even from Game 1 to Game 2, he was frustrated with a few calls that didn't go his way, but he didn't allow that to deter him from doing his job. He's garnering experience with that each day and each game.''</p>
        <p>Wallace shrugged his shoulders and offered no insight into his turnaround from villain to hero. ''Just playing ball,'' he said of his 11 points during the Trail Blazers' 28-8 third-quarter blowout of the Lakers in Game 2.</p>
        <p>''You pretty much feel like you're on a roll and can score at any time,'' he said. ''They did the same thing to us in Game 1 when they blew us up in that second quarter. That's just how it goes. If you put a whole lot into it, it turns out to be a good story.''</p>
        <p>Wallace's offensive production was only part of the plot. His biggest impact came on defense, where he and Pippen helped center Arvydas Sabonis stop Shaquille O'Neal, who scored only 9 points through three quarters. Wallace also has spent significant time guarding Kobe Bryant, who has 25 points in two games.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say I've shut him down,'' Wallace said. ''We've been doubling on him, so it doesn't make sense for him to shoot over a double or sometimes a triple team.''</p>
        <p>To Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy, Wallace's play in Game 2 was a simple case of the forward's channeling his energy toward the Lakers instead of the officials.</p>
        <p>''The difference in Rasheed was about 20 minutes,'' Dunleavy quipped afterward.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to try and fool anybody,'' Dunleavy said today. ''I can talk all I want to Rasheed, say all I need to say to him, say all the right things. But it comes down to him wanting it. He's got to make that decision.</p>
        <p>''He's heard it from me, from anybody and everybody you can think of, all his coaches over the years, and at some point it's got to become important to him. Last game was very important to him, to step out and play the way he played.''</p>
