        <p>In an unusually public display of acrimony among the caretakers of the nation's nuclear stockpile, Sandia National Laboratories has charged that cost overruns on a giant laser at another federal laboratory may disrupt the program to ensure that the stockpile remains safe and reliable.</p>
        <p>The laser, the National Ignition Facility, is designed to mimic some conditions at the heart of an exploding hydrogen bomb. But its expected construction costs at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have doubled to $2.1 billion, and critics in Congress have begun to wonder aloud if the project is worthwhile.</p>
        <p>Since 1992, when the United States abandoned nuclear tests, the national laboratories have vied to devise ways to simulate nuclear explosions in hopes that these methods will allow them to determine whether stockpiled warheads are still usable.</p>
        <p>Officials at the Energy Department, which runs both Sandia in Albuquerque and Lawrence Livermore in Livermore, Calif., publicly rebuked Sandia, saying its criticism was inaccurate and, in any event, should not have been made in public.</p>
        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the Sandia criticism was ''totally out of line and inconsistent with the nation's stockpile stewardship policies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said the cost overruns would be handled with money from defense programs, and largely within Livermore's existing budget.</p>
        <p>''The labs are very competitive with each other, and this outburst is typical lab belly-aching that is sometimes aimed at jockeying for appropriations at the expense of each other,'' he said. ''While we have contained the rivalries in the past, it seems that N.I.F. is too big a pot to ignore.''</p>
        <p>Under pressure, Sandia tempered its stance late yesterday, issuing a more conciliatory statement on the project.</p>
        <p>But opponents of the laser seized on the original statement to advance their argument that the project was unworkable.</p>
        <p>''The objections have been echoing around the weapons complex for the last couple of years,'' said Christopher Paine, a senior researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''They're now being publicly stated.''</p>
        <p>The National Ignition Facility would consist of 192 individual laser beams converging on a tiny pellet of nuclear fuel to generate fusion energy -- a vastly scaled-down version of one element of a hydrogen bomb.</p>
        <p>The laser, like other parts of the stockpile stewardship program at Sandia, Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratory, would allow scientists to approach the harsh conditions in bombs for study. But the project, which has been under construction since 1997, has encountered a series of problems, including the resignation of its director, construction delays and ballooning costs.</p>
        <p>Those problems led to the critical statement on Tuesday from Tom Hunter, a senior vice president for defense programs at Sandia.</p>
        <p>Delays and overruns at the laser project ''will disrupt the investment needed to be made at the other laboratories,'' Mr. Hunter said. ''This causes us to question what is a reasonable additional investment in the N.I.F.''</p>
        <p>Even though Sandia had contacted reporters with those criticisms, the statement today called their release inadvertent. Mr. Hunter is quoted in the release as saying that ''public divisiveness is not helpful in finding good solutions,'' but he did not directly contradict the criticisms.</p>
        <p>Rod Geer, a Sandia spokesman, said ''the concern still exists'' on how the various parts of the stockpile stewardship program will fit together financially.</p>
        <p>Clay Sell, a staff member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the cost overruns were placing the project in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely, it's in danger as a program,'' Mr. Sell said.</p>
        <p>Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who is a member of the committee, said, ''The project's costs appear to be rising sky-high,'' adding that ''Congress needs to take more decisive action to prevent further money down the drain.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said: ''We believe N.I.F. is important. And I have made the necessary management and structural changes to make it viable. The last thing we need is the Congress to try to decimate the project on the basis of their own local priorities.''</p>
