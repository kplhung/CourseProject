        <p>With Suits Settled, A Rap Party</p>
        <p>On Wednesday night, hours after the rap impresario SEAN COMBS settled the last lawsuit arising from a stampede at a City College basketball game that he promoted in 1991, he went partying. He was surrounded by a familiar crowd as he introduced the latest addition to his Bad Boy Records label, the teenage girl group called dream (which spells its name with a lowercase d). ANDRE HARRELL, the president of Bad Boy; RUSSELL SIMMONS, another hip-hop impresario; and Mr. Combs's mother, JANICE, were on hand at Laura Belle on West 43rd Street.</p>

        <p>With Suits Settled, A Rap Party</p>
        <p>On Wednesday night, hours after the rap impresario SEAN COMBS settled the last lawsuit arising from a stampede at a City College basketball game that he promoted in 1991, he went partying. He was surrounded by a familiar crowd as he introduced the latest addition to his Bad Boy Records label, the teenage girl group called dream (which spells its name with a lowercase d). ANDRE HARRELL, the president of Bad Boy; RUSSELL SIMMONS, another hip-hop impresario; and Mr. Combs's mother, JANICE, were on hand at Laura Belle on West 43rd Street.</p>
        <p>One person who was not was Mr. Combs's longtime mentor, CLIVE DAVIS, who founded Arista Records and was replaced several weeks ago. ''I wish it could have ended in a better way,'' Mr. Combs said of Mr. Davis's work at Arista. ''I will always stay loyal to him.''</p>
        <p>How loyal? When his own contract with Arista is up, would Mr. Combs join forces with him? ''I would seriously think about it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>New Awards For Stage Couture</p>
        <p>The actor JOEL GREY did not have much time. He was moving, for the first time in 25 years. Still, he made time to join 100 theater luminaries at Sardi's yesterday to celebrate the Fashion Institute of Technology's new prizes for Broadway costume design. The awards are named for the Tony Award-winning designer and Fashion Institute alumna Patricia Zipprodt, who died last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grey recalled a visit to Ms. Zipprodt's home on Martha's Vineyard. He swatted down a wasp, or so he thought. He reveled in his children's admiration ''that their father could do something besides act.'' The euphoria lasted until he put on his shoe and discovered his flying adversary tucked in it.</p>
        <p>The actress MARIAN SELDES talked about how well Ms. Zipprodt dressed herself. ''Whenever I was with her, I thought I looked like a seamstress and she looked like a great actress,'' Ms. Seldes said. ''She looked like what you thought an actress should look like.''</p>
        <p>Weatherman Faces Drug Charge</p>
        <p>A lot can happen between the 6 o'clock news and the 11 o'clock news. The police said they arrested MARK DANON, a forecaster for WCBS-TV, at 8:25 p.m. on Wednesday after a detective watched him buy two one-gram bags of cocaine two blocks from the station's news studio. The detective said Mr. Danon had told him, ''I'm sorry.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday Mr. Danon appeared before JUDGE DONNA G. RECANT in Criminal Court in Manhattan. He did not enter a plea to the misdemeanor charge of possession of a controlled substance; he also turned down an offer to plead guilty to disorderly conduct and enroll in a one-day treatment program. The judge scheduled another hearing for July 12.</p>
        <p>Channel 2, which told Mr. Danon last month that it would not renew his contract when it expired in July, said it had suspended him without pay ''pending results of the investigation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Danon did a little dance as he left the courthouse, trying to look casual and yet keep his back to the cameras. DANA ADAMS, a reporter and weekend anchor at Channel 2, was with him.</p>
        <p>Driving in Verse</p>
        <p>SAM SHEPARD, who plays the ghost of Hamlet's father in MICHAEL ALMEREYDA'S high-tech, New York-oriented film version of the Shakespeare play, learned his lines at the wheel of his pickup.</p>
        <p>''I was working on 'Snow Falling on Cedars' and driving back and forth to Vancouver because I mainly don't fly,'' said Mr. Shepard, who lives in Minneapolis. ''It gave me time to learn the part, speaking it over and over to myself. I'm not a quick study. I needed to soak in the language for all that time.''</p>
        <p>No wonder: it was his first Shakespeare role. ''I was quite intimidated by the awesomeness of the language,'' he said. ''I think most Americans are, unless they're complete fools. Oddly enough, once you get into it, it's some of the easiest language to memorize because of the rhythms and textures.''</p>
