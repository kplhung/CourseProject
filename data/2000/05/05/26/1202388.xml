        <p>Demi Moore stars in the dreamscape ''Passion of Mind,'' one of those other-side-of-the-looking glass pictures.

And when she closes her eyes at night, she's living in gray-blue Manhattan as Marty, a literary agent with her hair pulled back to heighten the severity of her loveless life in the big city.

        <p>Marie/Marty is aware of the assets and liabilities of both states, though she is unsure which is reality and which a dream.

        <p>Demi Moore stars in the dreamscape ''Passion of Mind,'' one of those other-side-of-the-looking glass pictures. During the daylight hours she's Marie and lives in a sun-dappled chateau in Provence with her two daughters, writing book reviews for this very newspaper. And when she closes her eyes at night, she's living in gray-blue Manhattan as Marty, a literary agent with her hair pulled back to heighten the severity of her loveless life in the big city. Fortunately she doesn't get around to reviewing any of the books by authors she signed, or there could be a very nasty battle between the two at Elaine's.</p>
        <p>Marie/Marty is aware of the assets and liabilities of both states, though she is unsure which is reality and which a dream. So Marie seeks the counsel of a friend about her roiling fantasy life, while Marty does it the old-fashioned Manhattanite way: she talks to a shrink, who never asks if she actually gets any rest during her extremely active dream life.</p>
        <p>''I don't know who I am anymore,'' she says in the opening narration, and it's easy to see where that sentiment comes from. It's the gauzy and underdramatized conception of the movie that lacks passion; she wanders through both of her lives terribly unfulfilled because she can't have what she wants: romance.</p>
        <p>The film really should be called ''Fashion of Mind,'' since the decor in both of her unrealities seems like something conjured by someone who has spent more time fantasizing about layouts in Architectural Digest than meeting deadlines. Anyone with this kind of specificity about the dwellings in her dreams has problems that this movie can't be bothered to develop; most people can't even remember what they wear in their dreams. In her New York apartment she has a bust of herself that is meant to suggest some psychological undercurrent but really looks like the kind of thing she sculptured with Patrick Swayze in ''Ghost,'' another fantasy-film landmark in Ms. Moore's career.</p>
        <p>With its dual and dueling-worlds structure, ''Passion'' may put viewers in mind of last year's ''Sliding Doors,'' which starred Gwyneth Paltrow, though it's much closer to the 1987 puzzle picture ''Julia and Julia,'' in which Kathleen Turner played a woman who was married in one reality and involved in a soft-core romantic blaze in another.</p>
        <p>There's a self-pitying side to ''Passion,'' with these ideal existences that both cry out for the love of a good man. Stellan Skarsgard is courting Marie in Europe, and the talented and eccentric William Fichtner, who manages to vary his appearance with every role, is the awkward and intense man seeking Marty's love in America.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem with such movies is that the audience often ends up feeling as if the creators themselves haven't committed to a single world to focus on; it's hard enough to make one reality work in movies and find a consistent tone for it. The tensions have to be built on contrasts that aren't sharp enough in ''Passion,'' especially since Marty/Marie has most of the things women her age would dream about. This situation also seems like the kind of ''you can have it all but not really'' projection that a much younger woman would have.</p>
        <p>To her credit, Ms. Moore is far too mature for the audience to believe that she is trapped in this purgatory. It's a difficult conceit to pull off, and not because she isn't working at it. Marie's relationship with her children, though slightly idealized, is thorny at times, as they compete for her attention, a grown-up touch contributed by the star, who apparently has huge stores of maternal warmth and patience. The director, Alain Berliner (''Ma Vie en Rose''), gives ''Passion'' an anonymous polish, but there's a definite sense that someone's hands are tied, perhaps by the both-sides-now whininess of the script by Ron Bass (''Rain Man,'' ''My Best Friend's Wedding'').</p>
        <p>Visually there's certainly a difference between the worlds, thanks to Eduardo Serra's cinematography. And since Marie and Marty are literally the day and night sides of the same woman, the halved personas need to open up and learn to love again.</p>
        <p>It's hard to take ''Passion'' seriously because it brings to mind the kind of shallow psychology that wouldn't be out of place in a history short about Sigmund Freud on ''ABC Schoolhouse Rock.'' If there's a sequel, perhaps Marie could have Marty represent her for the sale of her book or, at the very least, negotiate the deal for the made-for-Lifetime movie. Apparently she's the kind of driven negotiator it would take to sell the mild Harlequin Romance simple-mindedness of ''Passion of Mind.''</p>
        <p>''Passion of Mind'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some rather desultory sequences of lovemaking and strong language.</p>
