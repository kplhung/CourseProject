        <p>Patrick Ewing limped slightly down a Conseco Fieldhouse corridor, trailed by Dave Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, and the rest of the franchise's concerned brain trust. He wore an immaculately tailored suit and a grimace.</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose, the lean Indiana forward who slithered through the Knicks' frontline with ease last night, remembered thinking, ''Here we go again,'' when he saw Ewing leave midway through the first quarter.</p>
        <p>He was referring to how New York found a special resolve against the Pacers last season in the conference finals, stunningly winning in six games without their aging, yet proud, center. But as the game wore on, Rose realized: these are such different times.</p>
        <p>This deflating 88-84 loss left the Knicks down by 2-0 in the Eastern Conference finals, and you have to be honest about their chances. The Knicks don't look nearly as good as they did last season, when they returned to Madison Square Garden knotted at one game apiece, their secret weapon, Marcus Camby, ready to spring to action and help bail them out.</p>
        <p>These Knicks: Ewing is injured with a sprained tendon in his right foot, and who knows how effective he will be if he plays. Chris Childs had an ice pack strapped to his right knee and appeared to have trouble walking. Latrell Sprewell is in a major funk, unable to produce at the most clutch moments.</p>
        <p>On the Knicks' last offensive possession last night, Sprewell backed the 6-foot point guard Travis Best into the post along the left baseline and, with Rose sprinting to double team, released a shot that bounced high off the back rim with 5.8 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Dale Davis rebounded and was immediately fouled. Now, Davis being a poor free-throw shooter and all, the Knicks were hoping to get some kind of prayer play to work at the end. But they could not even get to that point because they botched one of the most fundamental plays in basketball.</p>
        <p>Missing the first free throw badly, Davis also missed the second. But with only Allan Houston and Sprewell positioned on the blocks to grab a rebound, Davis went over the top of Charlie Ward, grabbed his own miss, and fed Rose for a dunk as the building nearly imploded with noise.</p>
        <p>The Knicks forgot to block out the shooter. After it ended, Sprewell slammed the basketball to the floor. Camby grabbed the ball and threw it hard off the backboard.</p>
        <p>Having come so close to persevering in Ewing's absence again and pulling off a victory with their grit and heart, they fell victim to brain lock.</p>
        <p>Were there questionable calls that helped the Pacers shoot 20 more free throws than the Knicks, a 38-18 margin that had Coach Jeff Van Gundy laughing about the alleged leaguewide conspiracy to ensure a Knick-Laker final? Yes.</p>
        <p>Did Larry Johnson play a mammoth role in giving the Knicks a chance in Ewing's absence, producing 25 points, backing the smaller Rose into the post, using his brawn and guile to score inside on left-handed lay-ins or rise up for a short fall-away jump shot? Yes.</p>
        <p>Can the Knicks as comprised beat the Pacers four out of five games over the next 10 days? That's a little tougher to answer.</p>
        <p>The longer the second half dragged on, the more uncomfortable the game grew for the Knicks.</p>
        <p>While Kurt Thomas, Camby and even Chris Dudley gave them key minutes, the Knicks' reserves also had trouble finishing plays, keeping Davis off the glass.</p>
        <p>''We missed a ton of layups,'' Van Gundy said. ''I mean, you have to finish.''</p>
        <p>No one in New York had seen the Knicks at the Garden since their pulsating comeback against Miami in Game 6 of the semifinal series last Friday. The players returning home tomorrow afternoon will bear no resemblance.</p>
        <p>If Ewing is out, Camby, Johnson, Thomas and Dudley used sparingly are all they have.</p>
        <p>Camby was recently asked if he had ever thought about attending Pete Newell's Big Man Camp in Hawaii. The annual summer clinic, whose alumni include such pivots as Bill Walton, Hakeem Olajuwon and Shaquille O'Neal, is geared toward improving the skills of the 7-foot-and-over crowd.</p>
        <p>''Nah,'' he said. ''Hawaii's too far. I'll stay out here and work with the coaches.''</p>
        <p>Camby was asked because it was no secret that he could use a few low-post lessons, develop a baby hook, a drop step, anything resembling a go-to move. The Knicks' 6-foot-11-inch dynamic young forward has gradually gone from the little-known phenom of the 1999 playoffs to the player who has been included in everyone's game plan this season.</p>
        <p>If the Pacers have truly figured out Camby and New York -- and it seems as if they are off to an impressive start -- Hawaii may be much closer than the Knicks want to believe.</p>
