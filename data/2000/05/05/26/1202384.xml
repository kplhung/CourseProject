        <p>''This is the West, not the East.''

        <p>''This is the West, not the East.'' So Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson), a scruffy, laid-back outlaw of dubious competence, admonishes his reluctant partner, an imperial guard from the Forbidden City named Chon Wang (pronounced like John Wayne and played by the incomparable Jackie Chan). In ''Shanghai Noon,'' Tom Dey's slapstick kung fu horse opera, the twain meet in a series of rousing comic collisions, but in the geography of global pop culture they've never been all that far apart.</p>
        <p>The Hong Kong action films of the 1970's and 80's (where Mr. Chan first became a star) owe as much to the spaghetti westerns of the 60's as the spaghetti westerns owe to earlier samurai movies, which in turn were inspired by the classic John Ford and Howard Hawks cowboy pictures, which grew out of the old Tom Mix two-reelers, and so on all the way back to ''The Great Train Robbery'' almost a century ago.</p>
        <p>But who cares? Jackie Chan -- whose given name, Kong Sang Chan, means ''born in Hong Kong'' -- is an entertainer whose appeal transcends differences of culture, age and taste. The appreciation of his genius requires no excursions into the history of cinema. It's nonetheless worth noting that, in an age of widespread movie star narcissism, when sullen vanity often stands in for seriousness and lazy cynicism for wit, Mr. Chan recalls the icons of an earlier time, the improbably graceful, virtuosically silly clowns of the silent era: Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, who are his deepest source of inspiration.</p>
        <p>In ''Shanghai Noon'' his astonishing physical gifts find a perfect counterpoint in Mr. Wilson's goofy verbal riffing. The two of them are thrown together when Chon is dispatched to the rugged Old West to rescue a kidnapped princess (Lucy Liu), and finds himself transporting her ransom on the very train Roy and his gang have decided to rob. Roy has a spacey, surfer-dude approach to outlawry, and he mystifies the tightly wound Chon with his loopy New Age pronouncements.</p>
        <p>''You need to relax,'' he admonishes Chon when they are forced to share a jail cell. ''You are the most irritable guy I've ever been around.'' Later, before a shootout with the main heavy, one Marshal Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley), Roy's inner voice tells him to ''be the bullet,'' and he screams at his impatient adversary: ''I won't let you cheapen this! A duel is a sacred moment.''</p>
        <p>The movie benefits from an unusually witty, high-spirited script, by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, the authors of ''Lethal Weapon 4.'' There are moments that echo Mel Brooks's ''Blazing Saddles,'' but instead of Mr. Brooks's borscht belt ethnic insult humor, ''Shanghai Noon'' traffics in the high farce of multicultural misunderstanding. It tweaks stereotypes even as it spoofs multicultural sensitivity. (''That's taken out of context,'' Roy protests after Chon confronts him about some overheard anti-Chinese remarks.)</p>
        <p>It's not easy to wring comedy from the history of Chinese laborers and Native Americans in the Old West, but somehow the filmmakers finesse the issue without evading it entirely. And a hint of upbeat patriotism finds its way into the mix. The first English phrases Chon learns are ''America'' and ''happily ever after,'' and his adventures are a raucous celebration of the raucous, slapdash individualism that is part of the West's -- or at least the western's -- most vital legacy.</p>
        <p>In an early, especially inspired sequence, Chon is taken in by some Indians, for whom his rudimentary English might as well be Mandarin. After a night of heavy peace-pipe smoking -- featuring a hilarious montage of his increasingly pixilated face -- Chon wakes up to find himself with a new wife (Brandon Merrill), a new name (Fights-in-a-Dress) and a lot of face paint. (Later he turns up on wanted posters as the Shanghai Kid, even though, as he points out, he's not from Shanghai at all.)</p>
        <p>Resplendent in his Indian warrior-imperial guard get-up, he walks into a saloon, where . . . but just go see it, already. Mr. Chan's fight scenes are like nothing else in the movies, and they're staged without trickery or flashy special effects. The thrill is like that of watching a great athlete or musician; it's a perfect marriage of discipline and grace.</p>
        <p>It's also giddily, effervescently funny, like the complicated Chinese drinking game Chon and Roy play in adjoining bathtubs or the drunken horse routine that follows. There's a motley assortment of villains (notably the feline Roger Yuan and the donkeyish Walton Goggins) and some vague love interests lurking in the background -- the Indian bride and the fairy tale princess, who both seem like pretty good sports. But ''Shanghai Noon'' is, in classic western tradition, a celebration of male bonding, unabashedly juvenile, boyishly risque and disarmingly sweet. Mr. Wilson and Mr. Chan have enough chemistry to fuel a string of sequels.</p>
        <p>O.K., so not all the jokes work, and the plot limps a little toward the end. No matter. After the glum bullying of ''Gladiator'' and the noisy bombast of ''M:I-2,'' it's refreshing to see a movie so good natured, so confident of its ability to provoke not queasy awe or numb exhaustion but pure delight. ''You have a certain nobility,'' Roy tells Chon in a moment of misty cowboy sentiment. In the context of the movie, the line is pure hokum, but applied to Mr. Chan, it's right on the money.</p>
        <p>''Shanghai Noon'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a lot of high-spirited fighting and gunplay, which occasionally has fatal consequences, and a smattering of salty cowboy lingo.</p>
