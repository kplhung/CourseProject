      <abstract>
        <p>Letter from Massoud Derhally says Israel was not only cause of Lebanon's misery; says with Israelis gone, Lebanon's ability to restore peace will rest on whether it can curb Hezbollah, with aid of Syria and Iran</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Israel's retreat from Lebanon (front page, May 24) demonstrates how the political situation has evolved since the 1982 invasion. The withdrawal was inevitable because the presence of troops was too high a price for the military as well as for any Israeli prime minister.</p>
        <p>Lebanon's ability to restore peace will depend on how the different religious communities come to terms with one another. More important, it will rest on whether Lebanon can curb Hezbollah, with the aid of Syria and Iran.</p>

        <p>Israel was not the only cause of Lebanon's misery. I don't think people in the region know how to live in freedom and democracy. But if they learn to, Lebanon may once again be known as the Switzerland of the Middle East.</p>
