        <p>Chuck Knoblauch smiled at two reporters who approached his locker this afternoon and raised his hands. ''See, I made it through the night,'' Knoblauch said.</p>
        <p>The joke was on him, a reference to the dire comments he made after he made another throwing error on Wednesday night. Less than an hour after his mistake, Knoblauch suggested that the problem might force him to retire. ''I don't need this,'' he said repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Further removed from those emotions today, Knoblauch was more circumspect, saying that while he does need to solve the problem, he is not thinking of retiring any time soon, not during this season. ''That's quitting; I'm not into quitting,'' he said. ''If I was really whacked, I'd be in the Caymans right now, or Martha's Vineyard.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch continued to speak frankly about the throwing problem, adding that he was willing to consider any suggestions from the club about seeing a therapist.</p>
        <p>To Manager Joe Torre, the fact that Knoblauch is talking about the problem, about his frustration, his feelings -- something he did not really do for more than a year -- is a ''very good'' sign.</p>
        <p>''I think we're allowed to do that now,'' Torre said. ''Players and athletes are always seen as rough and tough, and we weren't allowed to be sad or cry, or feel bad. It was always full speed ahead without any sensitivity. I think talking about it is definitely a positive.''</p>
        <p>Using a therapist, Torre said, ''obviously has to start with Chuck's willingness to do that.</p>
        <p>''And we'll definitely research that, because we're here to help by whatever means we can to get it accomplished,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch won a Gold Glove award for his strong defensive play in 1997, but after joining the Yankees, his throwing jitters first surfaced in 1998 and were rooted deeply in his play in 1999, when he had 14 throwing errors among 26 over all.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch went to spring training this year and concentrated on practicing the fundamentals of throwing.</p>
        <p>His throwing jitters were dormant in the first month of the season, but he has been afflicted again in recent weeks. The Cleveland Indians were determined to run on Knoblauch last weekend, and on Sunday, Enrique Wilson challenged Knoblauch's arm, racing around third and scoring on an inside-the-park home run, as the second baseman's throw sailed to the backstop.</p>
        <p>Then, in the eighth inning of Wednesday's game against the White Sox, Knoblauch fielded an easy grounder, started to throw, tried stopping when he saw first baseman Tino Martinez was not ready yet, and fired the ball into the ground, far to the right of Martinez. Knoblauch removed his glove and raised it in his right hand, as if he were going to throw it against the ground, then stopped before turning and watching the replay.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch got his second hit of the game in the next half-inning, as the Comiskey Park fans taunted him about his throwing. They cheered for each on-target toss in warm-ups before the ninth inning.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch met with Torre afterward, seething, mentioning the possibility he would eventually retire if he could not conquer the problem. Torre did not take Knoblauch's words literally, as if he were going to quit immediately; rather, Torre figured Knoblauch was just speaking out of frustration.</p>
        <p>''He was down,'' Torre said. ''He had such a good game, and the unfortunate thing was, that happening late in the game, it just took the good feeling away. We won two World Series with him, and you have to concentrate on what the whole package is. But I know that it bothers him.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch says that as he combats the throwing jitters, he must remember how good he can be; he knows this because he has been a great player in his career.</p>
        <p>''I've got six or seven years to look back on,'' Knoblauch said. ''I know what I'm capable of doing, and I know what type of player I can be. I know I'm an All-Star player. If I wasn't, I wouldn't have been in the All-Star Game four times.</p>
        <p>''You know that it's there. It's not like I'm trying to tap into something that's never been there. It's there. That's the thing that I have to go on. I'm trying to get back to where I was.</p>
        <p>''It's not like I'm sitting here in denial, and not willing to try anything; I am willing. But then again, nobody has the magic answer. I take full responsibility. It's me. It's only me. I'm the only one out there doing this.</p>
        <p>''You can't run from things. You can't hide from things. The best thing to do, I guess, is to talk about it.''</p>
