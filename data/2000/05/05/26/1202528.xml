        <p>The time, place and haunting howl of Patrick Ewing were uncanny as the Pacers ran back to the other end of the court. The Knicks' patched-and-pasted center had stopped still in front of his own bench tonight, six minutes into Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals.</p>

        <p>The time, place and haunting howl of Patrick Ewing were uncanny as the Pacers ran back to the other end of the court. The Knicks' patched-and-pasted center had stopped still in front of his own bench tonight, six minutes into Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>One year ago, Ewing was in this same city, on the Pacers' floor, when he partially tore his Achilles' tendon in the pregame layup line but played through Game 2, only to miss the rest of the playoffs. This time, he couldn't play any longer. With his playoff future uncertain, Ewing grimaced, groaned in pain and soon limped away from Game 2 after spraining the peroneal tendon in his right foot.</p>
        <p>''I just thought, 'Here we go again,' '' Latrell Sprewell said. ''I thought, 'I know we can do this.' We've done it before.''</p>
        <p>But once the final buzzer sounded on the Knicks' 88-84 loss in Game 2, once the team unraveled in a last-minute meltdown that was cruelly punctuated when Dale Davis gobbled up his own rebound on a missed free throw, the pixie dust had evaporated completely. The Knicks could not manufacture a victory without Ewing on the floor, and now find themselves down two games to none in a four-of-seven series, with Game 3 at Madison Square Garden on Saturday.</p>
        <p>As the relieved Pacers slipped away from the court feeling fortunate to have won at Conseco Fieldhouse, Sprewell grabbed the bouncing ball on the floor, crushed it into the floor loud enough to be heard above the cheers, and exited in disgust. He could have done so much more. Larry Johnson (25 points), Marcus Camby (11 rebounds), even a foul-ridden Allan Houston (15 points) had squeezed out inspirational performances.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to believe,'' Sprewell said. ''I picked an unfortunate time to have the worst playoff game of my career.''</p>
        <p>It was enough to have struggled all night against a big shot maker like Jalen Rose. But as the time spun off the game clock, and with the Knicks down by 2 points, Sprewell found the kind of mismatch seen on an asphalt court. Catching the Pacers on a defensive switch, Sprewell backed in against the 5-foot-11-inch Travis Best. Trying to overcome his wickedly off night, Sprewell turned, lifted up high and let a 10-footer spin off his hands, only to watch it hit hard on the rim with 5.8 seconds left.</p>
        <p>''We got the play we wanted,'' said Sprewell, who was 0 for 4 in the fourth quarter and finished 3 for 14 from the floor. ''It was perfect. I just didn't have it tonight.''</p>
        <p>His agony continued. Fouled on the play, Davis missed two free throws, but the undersized Charlie Ward -- at a disadvantage once Kurt Thomas fouled out -- couldn't block him out. Davis bolted through the lane, picked up the loose ball over Ward's head and whipped a pass to Rose, who scooted past an inattentive Sprewell and scored his 24th point of the night on a dunk just before the buzzer. It was the end to a miserable last three minutes of the game. A game the Knicks led by 6 with eight minutes to play got away once it was tied at 80-80 with 3 minutes 1 second remaining.</p>
        <p>''We couldn't hit a layup, didn't get rebounds,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''We just didn't do enough to win.''</p>
        <p>They weren't as aggressive as the Pacers, who went to the free-throw line 38 times compared with the 18 trips by the Knicks. They weren't quite as steady down the stretch, scoring just 4 points in the game's last three minutes.</p>
        <p>In Ewing's absence, the 7-foot-4 Rik Smits was able to pound into a feisty Thomas for 10 fourth-quarter points. The Knicks need Ewing, but have no idea when or if he'll be ready to play again. Ewing will have a magnetic resonance imaging test on his foot on Friday.</p>
        <p>Even after the game, the Knicks' center wasn't sure how he injured the foot. He just felt something pull. But Ewing said it wasn't related to the sore right arch that kept him out of practice on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''It's frustrating to watch from the sidelines,'' said Ewing, who spent the rest of the game in the locker room getting treatment. ''I'm going to try to come back on Saturday, and help my team win.''</p>
        <p>His team could have used his ability to get to the free-throw line. With foul trouble causing attrition, the Pacers took advantage of the Knicks' thinning talent in the game's last 30 seconds. As Reggie Miller (19 points) grabbed a pass on the perimeter with 28 seconds on the clock, an overzealous Houston crashed into him. Houston fouled out, and Miller hit both free throws to break an 84-84 tie.</p>
        <p>''We let our guard down against them last year when Patrick was out,'' said Miller, remembering how the Knicks eliminated the Pacers in six games without Ewing last year. ''Sprewell and Allan killed us. They will get more shots if Patrick is out.''</p>
        <p>So will Johnson. But as he entered the fourth quarter tonight, playing heavy minutes, he wasn't able to come up with a big play at the end. With the score tied, 82-82, he lined up a 3-pointer but missed. It was part of a fourth quarter when the Knicks hit 7 of 20 from the field while the Pacers connected on 55 percent of their shots. Now, everything looks dire for the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''We look for challenges,'' said Ward, who believed he was fouled by Davis on the missed free-throw attempt. ''Everyone will say we can't win the next four of five games. Never count the Knicks out. Nothing is impossible.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>MARCUS CAMBY can hear the Pacers calling out his name on the floor. ''The talk on the court was, 'Make sure you block out Marcus,' '' said Camby, who lost AUSTIN CROSHERE in 3-point territory during Game 1. ''They know what I did last year cost them a trip to the finals. They're not going to let me do the same things I did last year.'' . . . An emotional MARK JACKSON discussed his memories of Timberwolves guard Malik Sealy, who died in a car accident last week in Minneapolis. ''He was a phenomenal human being,'' said Jackson, who, like Sealy, played for St. John's. ''I feel blessed and fortunate to have had a relationship with him and his family, a wonderful family. To see a life tragically cut short like that is a terrible thing.''</p>
