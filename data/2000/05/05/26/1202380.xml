        <p>William Grimes Diner's Journal review of Rainbow Grill, now run by Cipriani family; photo; famous Promenade Bar is gone and Rainbow Room, used mostly for private parties, is open to public for dining and dancing on either Friday or Saturday night (S)</p>

        <p>Dinner at the Rainbow Grill is not so much a meal as a real estate transaction. You want to occupy 16 square feet in Midtown with an unsurpassed view? Prepare to pay. Patrons of the old Promenade Bar atop 30 Rockefeller Center should prepare to weep when they leave the elevator on the 65th floor. It is gone, gone, gone. And so is the elegance and romance. The Cipriani family, which now runs the former Promenade Bar and the Rainbow Room, have whittled down the bar operation and expanded the dining area, installing double rows of tables to make the Rainbow Grill. It's a little like an airplane. Diners with window seats get the view. The rest get to watch their fellow diners.</p>
        <p>Under the new regime, the Rainbow Room is used primarily for private parties. The public can dine and dance on either Friday or Saturday night, depending on the room's irregular schedule. The grill is open for lunch and dinner seven days a week. The food at the Rainbow Grill is Italian, very simple and perfectly acceptable at half the price. If $31 for an appetizer of tuna tartare sounds about right, then the Rainbow Grill is your kind of place. The prices are brazen, especially in light of the cheap tables, cafeteria silverware and drip-dry tablecloths. Appetizers start at $15 for a mixed salad and climb to $31 for a shrimp cocktail. Entrees top out at $54 for a sirloin steak. The three-course fixed-price menu at $60 may be the only way to avoid bankruptcy.</p>

        <p>Dinner at the Rainbow Grill is not so much a meal as a real estate transaction. You want to occupy 16 square feet in Midtown with an unsurpassed view? Prepare to pay.

        <p>Under the new regime, the Rainbow Room is used primarily for private parties. The public can dine and dance on either Friday or Saturday night, depending on the room's irregular schedule. The grill is open for lunch and dinner seven days a week. The food at the Rainbow Grill is Italian, very simple and perfectly acceptable at half the price.

        <p>Like the waiters in their white dinner jackets, the menu strikes a traditional note, with straightforward appetizers like prosciutto with melon, buffalo mozzarella with tomatoes, and quickly grilled tuna squares surrounding a bed of braised fennel. Main courses, too, stick to the middle of the road, with dishes like veal Milanese, red snapper with tomatoes and capers, and veal Marsala. The menu also includes a selection of dishes from Harry's Bar in Venice, like fish soup, risotto alla primavera, calf's liver alla veneziana and carpaccio alla Cipriani. Perhaps after the sticker shock, management decided that the customers should not be further agitated by the food.</p>
        <p>The view, by the way, is still spectacular.</p>
        <p>Rainbow Grill, 30 Rockefeller Center; (212) 632-5100. Dinner entrees, $36 to $54.</p>
