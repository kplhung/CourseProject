        <p>The Pentagon defended its antimissile plan yesterday  against a critic who contends that the proposed system of ground-based interceptors is crippled by a technical flaw.</p>
        <p>The critic, Theodore A. Postol, an arms expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, made his accusations in a May 11 letter to the White House. His criticism centers on the hardest part of the missile-defense challenge, distinguishing incoming weapons from decoys. He said a test had proved the job to be impossible, and said the Pentagon had conspired to cover up the failing.</p>
        <p>Yesterday in a brief statement, the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization said, ''The information on which he based his claims is incomplete and his conclusions are wrong.'' It said other parts of the antimissile system other than the criticized interceptor, including high-frequency radar on the ground and satellites in low orbit, would aid the job of distinguishing the decoys from the weapons.</p>
        <p>''Dr. Postol,'' the statement said, ''is not considering all the capabilities of our system of systems.''</p>
        <p>''For obvious reasons,'' the statement said, ''we do not discuss the capabilities of the systems and how they deal with countermeasures,'' the term for ways an enemy might try to outwit a defensive shield.</p>
        <p>Last week, the organization said a detailed written response was being prepared for Dr. Postol and the White House. Yesterday a spokesman said it had yet to be sent.</p>
