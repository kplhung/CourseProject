        <p>Artwork on display in museums and galleries may now be seized by state authorities as part of a criminal investigation, under legislation signed today by Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>The legislation is intended to aid the recovery of stolen artwork that has passed into the hands of private collectors and museums. In recent years, under growing public pressure, museums around the world have scoured their collections for artworks taken illegally from Jewish families during the Holocaust.</p>

        <p>Artwork on display in museums and galleries may now be seized by state authorities as part of a criminal investigation, under legislation signed today by Gov. George E. Pataki.</p>
        <p>The legislation is intended to aid the recovery of stolen artwork that has passed into the hands of private collectors and museums. In recent years, under growing public pressure, museums around the world have scoured their collections for artworks taken illegally from Jewish families during the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>New York law has prohibited the seizure of art from public exhibitions since the 1970's. Museum officials said they feared that the new law would discourage private collectors from exhibiting their art here.</p>
        <p>The governor also signed into law a plan intended to entice new teachers into public schools with salary bonuses, scholarships and other financial incentives.</p>
        <p>The program's centerpiece is a plan to provide cash grants to college students who agree to teach for four years in public schools that are facing a particularly severe shortage of teachers. The plan would give grants of $3,400 for each of the four years.</p>
