        <p>Michael Levine wanted what many people would in a new house: a safe neighborhood and low upkeep. But what really sold him on Centennial, a 900-home development north of Indianapolis, was the wiring -- a ready-to-use, high-speed Internet connection as well as cable and phone service, all provided by the builder.</p>
        <p>The Internet service is ''so much faster than anything I've ever seen,'' said Dr. Levine, a retired surgeon who moved in with his family in March. Since Internet access no longer requires a phone line and can go to more than one computer, ''nobody complains, 'Gee, I can't get online,' '' he said. ''While one kid is doing research, the other one is talking to her friend.''</p>
        <p>For a growing number of home buyers, high-speed Internet connections are becoming as important as a two-car garage, fireplace or new kitchen, prompting some developers and builders to jump into the telecommunications business. Either by building and owning neighborhood networks, or joining with telecommunications companies, they are offering Internet access, bundled with cable and phone service, at up to $20 a month below the typical cost. And instead of different bills, people might pay one fee -- perhaps $50 for Internet and cable -- through a homeowners' association.</p>
        <p>Their efforts are in the early stages, with most wired developments having sprouted in just the last year. How developers eventually fare against the regional phone companies, cable companies and other providers is anyone's guess.</p>
        <p>''What we began to see during the last couple of years is a huge explosion in demand'' for these connections, said Glen Barnard, who runs e-commerce at Kaufman &amp; Broad Home, a Los Angeles builder.</p>
        <p>Builders also see a way to have continuing revenue from these services -- perhaps 10 percent of the total fees -- and this income would be most welcome in a business that has its ups and downs. ''Wherever possible,'' Mr. Barnard said, ''we want to have an ownership interest in the infrastructure we're putting in.''</p>
        <p>High-speed, or broadband, access has been slow to reach many homes, even in centrally situated or wealthy neighborhoods, frustrating consumers used to speedy connections at work. One type of service, a digital subscriber line, is often not available to homes more than three miles from a phone company switching station. Even then, some homeowners have faced delays in getting hooked up. The other popular method, cable-modem service, has its own problems, including slowdowns at peak times.</p>
        <p>Only a few million American households have either service, even though analysts estimate that about 40 percent of the population uses the Internet. According to Jo Chapman, director of surveys at the National Association of Home Builders, only 5 percent of new homes come with ''structured'' wiring, the fatter in-home pipe needed to get the most from broadband service. But that should grow rapidly. Structured wiring can add several thousand dollars or more to the cost of a new home.</p>
        <p>Broadband is already a must for some home buyers. Moving from Redmond, Wash., recently, Ed and Judy Bott looked at 40 developments in Arizona before settling on DC Ranch, a new wired community in Scottsdale. The development has it all -- including structured wiring in every home -- and is served by U S West. ''Not having high-speed access would have been a deal breaker,'' said Mr. Bott, an author and magazine editor who telecommutes.</p>
        <p>The Botts know firsthand how difficult it can be getting the right set-up: their old home in Washington was supposed to have structured wiring, but the job was done poorly, they say, causing an expensive retrofit. ''We went through a painstaking process,'' said Ms. Bott, a public relations director for a Scottsdale technology company.</p>
        <p>At Toll Brothers, a luxury builder in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., executives have set up their own subsidiary to build and own broadband networks within Toll developments. Other builders, like Kaufman &amp; Broad, are weighing revenue-sharing arrangements with companies that will wire new communities, similar to deals struck by owners of some office buildings and high-end apartments. And some service providers, like SBC Communications, U S West, and Cox Communications, are seeking builders and developers to wire planned communities.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is working down the same path,'' said Richard Beckwitt, general partner of Encore Venture Partners, a fund whose major investors include a Texas builder, D. R. Horton. Encore is searching out Internet-related businesses that dovetail with home building, including broadband delivery. ''We're trying to get some ownership of the stream of revenue that passes through the Internet, the cable, the telephone lines after the house closes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some builders are taking a slower tack, unsure of how well all this will fare against established telecom companies. To keep buyers from sticking with old-line providers, some developers are including their brand of service in neighborhood association fees.</p>
        <p>One risk is that the capital spending required could be lost if newer technologies proliferate. ''The question for us is whether what is cutting-edge today will still be leading-edge tomorrow,'' said Jim Zeumer, director of investor relations for the Pulte Corporation, a builder in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. ''You can spend a lot of money laying whatever kind of pipe, then tomorrow, somebody has solved wireless, and all of a sudden you've got a whole new ball game.'' Still, Pulte is already testing some new ideas in Arizona. ''We are looking at other business structures we could roll out on a more nationwide basis.''</p>
        <p>The Centex Corporation, a Dallas builder that has been a leader in diversifying into areas like lawn care and home security, is proceeding cautiously. But Randy Luther, a vice president at its Centex Homes unit, said signs pointed to broadband becoming a much more important feature, especially as the first generation to grow up with computers starts buying homes. Many houses not built with structured wiring -- a feature Centex is pushing -- will be at a disadvantage in the resale market in five years, he said. ''It's not a question of if it's going to happen. It's a question of when.''</p>
        <p>For a lot of home builders, ''how they do it is still very much up in the air,'' adds John Stanley of UBS Warburg. ''It's probably a few years down the road before it means anything to the bottom line.'' But for most big builders, ''they've come to the conclusion they're leaving some money on the table'' if they do nothing.</p>
        <p>The opportunity exists because developers own the land that carries the wiring from homes to the outside world. This is especially true in developments in outlying suburbs and planned communities, where developers own the easements, providing a barrier to entry against cable, telephone and other rivals.</p>
        <p>The importance of this ''last mile'' or ''first mile'' in existing neighborhoods has helped drive some big mergers, like AT&amp;T's acquisition of Tele-Communications and MediaOne, and America Online's deal for Time Warner. Existing providers of telephone and cable service, meanwhile, are spending billions of dollars getting old-fashioned lines and wires in shape for high-speed service. And huge investments have been made in technologies bypassing the last mile, like satellite dishes and fixed wireless.</p>
        <p>''Developers have realized the first mile of real estate, which we previously gave away, is perhaps the most valuable real estate in the country,'' said Paul Estridge Jr., president of Estridge Companies, which built Centennial outside Indianapolis. With other backers, Estridge has formed a company, First Mile Technologies, to wire new developments. First Mile hopes to expand by cutting deals with other developers, offering them up to 10 percent of the revenue from services it sells their home buyers. Mr. Estridge estimates that for homeowners, the service could be 15 percent or more cheaper; for now, Centennial residents get it free while the company sorts out pricing.</p>
        <p>So far, the biggest problem is that residents have had phone calls routed through a cellular network, though Centennial says they will be linked up with a regular network in a few weeks.</p>
        <p>At Toll Brothers, executives recently announced a new unit, Advanced Broadband, which is wiring two new developments in Florida and one in Virginia. But Toll plans to expand that business and also to join forces with other builders and developers, said Michael Zammit, managing director for telecommunications at Toll. He expects the new Toll unit to help cash flow by 2002. ''Clearly it's a direction we see ultimately taking the company,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another start-up, Dynamic Telecom Engineering of Cleveland, has signed revenue-sharing deals with several builders, including Beazer Homes USA and Kaufman &amp; Broad. Dynamic Telecom will wire new developments and pay the builders 10 percent of its revenue, with some builders also getting an equity stake, said the president, Eli Asher.</p>
        <p>Some big phone and cable companies are also seeking out deals with developers. In addition to DC Ranch, U S West, the Denver-based phone company, has similar arrangements planned or under way with at least a dozen other big developments, said Vickey Callen, vice president and general manager of the broadband services unit.</p>
        <p>And two months ago, Newhall Land and Farming, a large developer outside Los Angeles, said it had made a deal to have SBC's Pacific Bell unit provide video, broadband and phone service to every new home in Newhall's Valencia and Newhall Ranch communities. Robin MacGillivray, a Pacific Bell executive, said some such agreements call for revenue sharing with the developer, depending on what state regulations permit. ''Developers are realizing that they need to offer their customers more than just news, weather and sports,'' she said.</p>
