        <p>To the Editor,</p>
        <p>I read with great sadness your May 19, 20 and 21 news articles about Ahsianea Carzan, the 5-year-old girl who died in the Bronx with signs of malnutrition.</p>
        <p>The social situation for Ahsianea was obviously complex. But nothing excuses permitting any child with a severe disability to become so malnourished.</p>

        <p>To the Editor,</p>
        <p>I read with great sadness your May 19, 20 and 21 news articles about Ahsianea Carzan, the 5-year-old girl who died in the Bronx with signs of malnutrition.</p>
        <p>The social situation for Ahsianea was obviously complex. But nothing excuses permitting any child with a severe disability to become so malnourished.</p>
        <p>This case represents a failure of the systems responsible for caring for needy children. Why wasn't an Agency for Children's Services worker knowledgeable enough to refer Ahsianea for interventions to experienced professionals? Why wasn't she in a special educational program as required under federal law?</p>
        <p>To avoid future tragedies for children with disabilities, we need better-trained caseworkers and better monitoring systems for at-risk children.</p>
