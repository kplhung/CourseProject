        <p>The editor of Texas Monthly resigned yesterday after 19 years. Gregory B. Curtis, who founded the magazine in 1973 with two colleagues and wrote some of the magazine's first articles, said that he would return to writing.</p>
        <p>Evan Smith, the magazine's deputy editor and a former deputy editor of The New Republic, will be the new editor in chief.</p>
        <p>Texas Monthly, which has a circulation of 300,000 readers, has won eight National Magazine Awards in its 27-year history, and has a reputation for publishing the work of little-known writers who later become relatively established figures in the magazine and literary world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Curtis founded the magazine with Michael R. Levy and William Broyles in 1973. They later sold a minority stake to Dow Jones &amp; Company. In 1998, the Emmis Communications Corporation, which owns radio and television stations and magazines in the United States, bought Texas Monthly from the founders and Dow Jones, adding it to its regional magazine stable, which includes Indianapolis and Cincinnati magazines. Emmis bought Los Angeles magazine from the Walt Disney Company in January.</p>
