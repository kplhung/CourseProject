      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial offers abbreviated list of vital court and criminal justice reforms needing attention before New York State Legislature closes in mid-June; says it should act on Chief Judge Judith Kaye's sensible plan to consolidate and symplify state's archaic court system; says it should raise fees for attorneys assigned to represent indigent defendants, noting fees have not been raised in 14 years; says state's proven program of televised access to judicial proceedings should be revived on permanent basis and without weakening restrictions; says state's law dealing with sexual assault must be updated to recognize seriousness of 'date rape'; says statute of limitations should be lifted for rape, given advances in DNA technology</p>

        <p>Scarlett O'Hara would have felt right at home in New York State's Legislature, where lawmakers habitually put off action on important matters for another day. But some issues involving the state's justice system cannot wait. Proposals by Gov. George Pataki and others for tougher gun laws merit prompt attention, as do the Rockefeller drug laws, which deserve repeal. Here is an abbreviated list of other vital court and criminal justice reforms needing attention before the Legislature closes shop in mid-June.</p>
        <p>Court restructuring.-- Three years after Chief Judge Judith Kaye unveiled her sensible plan to consolidate and simplify New York's archaic court system, Governor Pataki seems serious about making reform finally happen. But he will have to beat back attempts to preserve patronage by exempting Surrogate's Court from the reorganization. The next few weeks are critical. The overhaul requires amending the State Constitution, meaning it must be approved by two separate elected Legislatures -- this one and the one to be chosen in November -- before it gets put before voters.</p>

Here is an abbreviated list of other vital court and criminal justice reforms needing attention before the Legislature closes shop in mid-June.</p>
        <p>Court restructuring.-- Three years after Chief Judge Judith Kaye unveiled her sensible plan to consolidate and simplify New York's archaic court system, Governor Pataki seems serious about making reform finally happen. But he will have to beat back attempts to preserve patronage by exempting Surrogate's Court from the reorganization. The next few weeks are critical. The overhaul requires amending the State Constitution, meaning it must be approved by two separate elected Legislatures -- this one and the one to be chosen in November -- before it gets put before voters.</p>
        <p>Assigned counsel fees.-- Regrettably, the governor and the State Legislature overlooked pleas to raise the fees for attorneys assigned to represent indigent defendants -- the so-called 18-B rates -- when they fashioned a state budget last month. These fees have not been raised for 14 years, which has led to a mass exodus of experienced attorneys willing to take assigned counsel work, and a major disruption in the processing of cases. A way must be found to finance the modest increase Judge Kaye has proposed, perhaps by splitting the added expense between the state and localities.</p>
        <p>Cameras in the courtroom.-- The wise decision by State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi to allow televised coverage of the Amadou Diallo murder trial in Albany has underscored the Legislature's error when it let the state's successful 10-year experiment with cameras in the courtroom lapse in 1997. The task now is to revive -- on a permanent basis and without weakening restrictions -- the proven program of televised access to judicial proceedings.</p>
        <p>Sexual assault law reform. -- New York's law dealing with sexual assault needs updating to recognize the seriousness of ''date rape,'' change antiquated terminology and address other problems. The State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, recently introduced a promising reform package, opening the door for serious negotiations with the governor and the Senate. Progress now depends largely on the governor's willingness to drop -- at least for now -- controversial parts of his 52-point Sexual Assault Reform Act that are anathema to the Assembly, such as giving prosecutors the right to appeal sentences and bail decisions.</p>
        <p>DNA tests and statutes of limitations. -- Governor Pataki has shown a laudable interest in taking advantage of DNA technology to improve the criminal justice system. He recently proposed a new state DNA Review Committee to examine all convictions in New York that were overturned because of new genetic evidence. But his call for ending the statute of limitations for all class B violent felony offenses is too broad. A sound compromise would lift the statute of limitations for rape and a limited number of other violent offenses in which decisive biological evidence would most likely be present.</p>
