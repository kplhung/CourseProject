        <p>There is a line that appears a couple of times in ''M:I-2'' (though not quite as often as the series' patented rubber-mask trick, which never seems to fail even though all the spies already know it).

        <p>Robert Towne, one of Hollywood's most respected screenwriters, explains that thus it is with all action franchises, from 007 to Batman. The genesis of each installment is not in the hero but in the hero's quest, and that means a villain with a plausible and nefarious scheme.</p>

        <p>There is a line that appears a couple of times in ''M:I-2'' (though not quite as often as the series' patented rubber-mask trick, which never seems to fail even though all the spies already know it). It's a nifty bit of deconstruction: ''Any search for a hero must begin with what a hero requires -- a villain.''</p>
        <p>Robert Towne, one of Hollywood's most respected screenwriters, explains that thus it is with all action franchises, from 007 to Batman. The genesis of each installment is not in the hero but in the hero's quest, and that means a villain with a plausible and nefarious scheme.</p>
        <p>Perhaps some moviegoers are wondering what Mr. Towne, the author of ''Shampoo,'' ''Chinatown'' and other classics, is doing on a John Woo shoot-'em-up, even one that stars Mr. Towne's frequent superstar collaborator, Tom Cruise. Some might even be expecting Mr. Towne to peel off a rubber mask and be revealed as, oh, Shane Black or Jeb Stuart or some other action-flick specialist. But the project was not without its allure.</p>
        <p>''Ever since the end of the cold war, people have been looking for a good villain,'' said Mr. Towne, dressed in track shorts and T-shirt, as he sipped a cappuccino at his Pacific Palisades home. For a while it was Arab terrorists. Then it was arms dealers or renegade Russians or evil Washington bureaucrats. Nothing seemed to work quite so well as those old standbys, the Nazis and the K.G.B.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towne said he was watching ''60 Minutes'' a few years ago when he saw a segment about new boutique antibiotics that kill specific strains of viruses. He filed the idea away. A bit later he was reading an article in National Geographic about Eskimos and a weird strain of virus found frozen in the Arctic ice. The dime dropped. How's that for a villain? A pharmaceutical company that makes a super-killer virus just so it can sell people the antidote!</p>
        <p>''It's tricky writing for a franchise series like 'Mission: Impossible' because there are certain things that you know you cannot do,'' Mr. Towne said. ''The single biggest challenge is to convince the audience that the hero might die.''</p>
        <p>Or, if not the hero, at least the hero's love interest or sidekick.</p>
        <p>''The one thing you can work with is the emotional life of your hero,'' Mr. Towne said. ''If there is a romance, will the girl survive?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Towne, who had a hand in writing the 1996 ''Mission: Impossible'' movie, was involved in the sequel early on but dropped out when he went to direct ''Without Limits,'' for which Mr. Cruise was co-producer. Several other writers -- Mr. Towne estimates seven or eight -- were brought into the sequel, and several plot lines were flirted with. But by the time Mr. Towne returned to the project after completing ''Without Limits,'' the filmmakers had returned to the original virus idea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towne said the ''M:I-2'' team took to heart some of the criticism of the first film: that it was needlessly complex and that too many crucial plot points were buried beneath sound cues and the rattle of explosions.</p>
        <p>They didn't want to abandon all the complexity; they figured the puzzle was part of the pleasure of the series. But extra efforts were made to ensure that all crucial plot points were given enough space and time to register with the audience.</p>
        <p>As for the key to Mr. Cruise's hero, the super-agent Ethan Hunt, it is, Mr. Towne said, in the actor's own basic character.</p>
        <p>''He is a risk taker,'' Mr. Towne said. ''Tom loves risks. And that's what drives Ethan.''</p>
        <p>It's the ''Impossible'' part of the title that attracts the star and the character, Mr. Towne said, as much as the working out of the mission. Hunt always seems to solve problems by doing something riskier than anyone else would dream of trying, yet he somehow manages to be in full control in the process. Like a character from Greek mythology, he puts on wings and flies toward the sun, but he does not fall.</p>
        <p>''That's the key,'' Mr. Towne said. ''He looks like Icarus, but he is really Daedalus.''</p>
        <p>The wax does not melt from Tom Cruise's wings. ''He knows the limits of adhesion,'' Mr. Towne said.</p>
        <p>The Public Pulse</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, back when people wore leisure suits and Steven Spielberg and George Lucas were inventing the summer blockbuster, Hollywood's most lucrative period began on Memorial Day weekend and ended on Labor Day. Well, it's been many years since that was true, with more and more summer-type blockbusters opening in mid-May, then early May and now, as with this year's ''U-571,'' in April.</p>
        <p>So this Memorial Day weekend, the summer movie season is well under way.</p>
        <p>There are already two huge successes -- Ridley Scott's ''Gladiator'' and Disney's ''Dinosaur'' -- and ''M:I-2'' is widely expected to be the third. There have also been some notable failures, like ''The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' and the bona fide disaster of ''Battlefield Earth.''</p>
        <p>Can we learn anything yet about what audiences are hungry for this year?</p>
        <p>''In the digital age, perhaps movies are as much about the places they take you as the stories they tell,'' said Walter F. Parkes, who with Laurie MacDonald is jointly head of production at DreamWorks, which released ''Gladiator.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parkes and Ms. MacDonald,  who were also executive producers of ''Gladiator,'' this week signed a new six-year deal with Dreamworks that will allow them to continue their administrative duties while producing some of their own movies, including films for Mr. Spielberg, one of the studio's principals.</p>
        <p>Douglas Wick, one of the producers of ''Gladiator,'' said audiences seemed ready for new things.</p>
        <p>''My sense is, it's one of those periods where there's a little bit of fatigue with the same-old, same-old,'' said Mr. Wick, whose producing credits also include the recent ''Stuart Little'' and the coming ''Hollow Man,'' an invisible-man thriller. ''There is no question that there is an appetite for unusual things.''</p>
        <p>Thus, while this summer season has its share of sequels (''M: I-2,'' ''The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps,'' ''Pokemon 2000'') and some car-chase action films like those popular in previous summers (''Gone in 60 Seconds''), there are also a lot of big, expensive movies with unusual settings: second-century Rome in ''Gladiator,'' colonial America in ''The Patriot,'' North Atlantic fishing grounds in ''The Perfect Storm.''</p>
        <p>And there are ''dinosaurs like nobody's ever seen before,'' Mr. Wick said.</p>
        <p>''At the moment, it's better to go into the marketplace with something that feels new,'' he said. ''Maybe it's just an old genre, like sword-and-sandal movies, given new life with new technology.''</p>
