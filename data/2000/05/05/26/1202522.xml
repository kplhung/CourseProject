        <p>Some of the world's most spectacular peaks sat for portraits by Vittorio Sella (1859-1943): the Matterhorn in Switzerland, Kangchenjunga in Nepal, K2 in the western Himalayas, Elbrus in the Caucasus, Mount St. Elias in Alaska.

        <p>'Vittorio Sella, Mountaineer  and Photographer, 1879-1909'  New York School of Interior Design  161 East 69th Street  Manhattan  Through June 10</p>
        <p>Some of the world's most spectacular peaks sat for portraits by Vittorio Sella (1859-1943): the Matterhorn in Switzerland, Kangchenjunga in Nepal, K2 in the western Himalayas, Elbrus in the Caucasus, Mount St. Elias in Alaska. In fact, this intrepid Italian climber, who lugged Dallmeyer cameras weighing up to 40 pounds and glass plates of 2 pounds each, is thought by many to have been the greatest mountain photographer of all time.</p>
        <p>Not a far-fetched assessment, as this show, organized by Wendy Watson, curator of the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum and presenting more than 80 photographs, makes clear.</p>
        <p>Soaring summits, vast spaces, sprawling glaciers, breathtaking crevasses, awesome ice falls and the people who surmounted them were all grist for Sella's picture-making, which produced important scientific and documentary information as well as images of great aesthetic quality.</p>
        <p>A stunning telephoto shot of the summit of Jannu, a peak of the Kangchenjunga ensemble, shows a grand colossus of icy crags looming implacably against a sunset sky. An incredible panorama of the Baltoro Glacier in Karakorum, the western Himalayas, records K2, at 28,250 feet the world's second highest peak, along with two others, Broad Peak and Gasherbrum IV, towering above a broad, winding trail of snowy ribbons.</p>
        <p>In an Alpine photograph, taken in 1884, a lone figure sporting a dashing Tyrolean hat stands near the brink of a perilous crevasse on the snow-packed Aletsch glacier.</p>
        <p>Sella often hand-colored his prints to give a glow to a sky or a cast to snow, and he was not above the occasional insertion of figures after the fact, for reasons of scale or drama.</p>
        <p>Never mind. There have been mountaineering photographs before and since, but few with the freshness and compositional clarity of these.</p>
