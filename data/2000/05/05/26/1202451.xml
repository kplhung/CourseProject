        <p>The sharp wooden spears and all the ankle bells posed a bit of a problem. They are, after all, not exactly standard prison fare. But for the visiting dancers from the National Ballet of Rwanda, who said they were spreading a message of reconciliation as widely as possible during their first appearance in North America, officials at the Washington Corrections Center for Women made an exception.</p>
        <p>''We want all kinds of Americans to see that people can move forward together,'' Eugene Kayihura, the first counselor at the Rwandan Embassy, said in explaining the dancers' unusual detour to the prison.</p>
        <p>''Hutu, Tutsi, Twa, they can dance together,'' Mr. Kayihura continued, listing the three main ethnic groups in that African country, ravaged by a civil war in 1994 that left more than 500,000 people dead and turned millions more into refugees. ''Yes, what people know now of Rwanda is genocide. You go on the Internet and you type 'Rwanda,' and the first thing you will see is 'genocide.' The genocide happened. But we believe this is a sign of what can happen in the post-genocide era.''</p>
        <p>The Rwandan dancers came here for nearly a week of performances at the Seattle International Children's Festival. True to its reputation as one of the largest and most far-reaching arts festivals for young people in the country, the program last week succeeded in bringing a striking array of troupes from around the world. Among the performers were the Ho Chi Minh City Water Puppet Theater from Vietnam; the Lakota Sioux Indian Theater; the Bustan Abraham contemporary ensemble, featuring Jewish and Arab musicians from Israel; and the B'net Marrakech, a music and dance troupe from Morocco.</p>
        <p>But none generated more attention than the Rwandan dancers, and none seemed to carry a stronger message for old and young alike that ''dance can make everybody more peace-loving,'' in the words of Buregeya Deo, 33, one of the 15 dancers in the group, formally known as Imparage: The Hutus, Tutsis and Pygmies of Rwanda. (The Pygmies are also known as Twa.)</p>
        <p>The group is a unit of Rwanda's national ballet, whose origins date to 1974 but which was torn apart, as was almost everything else in the nation, by the roughly 100 days of insanity six years ago, when many Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed by Hutu extremists. Most current members of the ballet were refugees, and many had relatives who were killed.</p>
        <p>There was, then, some irony in the fact that the dancers agreed to end their American visit with a trip to the women's prison here, which was arranged by festival organizers, prison officials and Pat Graney, a Seattle choreographer who runs an arts program, called Keeping the Faith, for imprisoned women.</p>
        <p>And even though the dances, many focusing on harvest and courtship themes, involved exuberant and even joyous outbursts of singing and foot-stamping, there were at least small signs that fear and tension persist.</p>
        <p>As a reporter conducted an interview today after the prison performance, one of the Rwandan dancers gently touched his arm when she saw him write the word ''Hutu'' in his notebook. ''Why did you write 'Hutu' in there?'' she wanted to know. Reading back part of what she had just said to him, he replied, ''All our people are Rwandese -- not Hutu, not Tutsi, Rwandese.'' Yes, she nodded vigorously, that was the point she wanted to make.</p>
        <p>Some dancers, the Rwandan officials accompanying them said, probably have relatives in prison for the 1994 slaughter. There was intense mutual curiosity during a discussion after the dancers, many dressed in flowing bleached headdresses, performed. Some dancers said they found maximum-security conditions for the women here preferable to the prisonlike circumstances they had endured in refugee camps.</p>
        <p>The discussion was animated, despite being slowly translated back and forth into English, French and Kinyarwanda, the Rwandan language. ''We do have our own war going on in America right now,'' one of the inmates said. But just as she started to explain, another inmate cut in, saying, ''I'm sure our war is nothing compared to yours.''</p>
        <p>Since recreating their ruined costumes and drums and finding a new home in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, the dancers have appeared in several European countries and in South Africa. Plans for their trip here started when the Seattle festival's producing director, Brian Faker, saw them last summer in Belgium.</p>
        <p>''I totally fell in love with it,'' Mr. Faker said of the African dances, which deal with folklore but not with the tragedy of the genocide -- not yet, anyway. ''And it's exactly the kind of program we want to do.''</p>
        <p>Last month Paul Kagame took the oath of office as Rwanda's first Tutsi president, calling on all Rwandans to shun ethnic divisions, and the nation's director of folklore and ballet, Bernardin Rutazibwa, who came with the dancers, said he hoped they could help spread that appeal, and that they would make more such visits to the United States.</p>
        <p>''We just would like to show the world that we are not as disunited as people might think,'' Mr. Rutazibwa said. ''And I think this is more eloquent than a bunch of political speeches.''</p>
