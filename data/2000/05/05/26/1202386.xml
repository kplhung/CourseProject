        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''MARRIAGE OF FIGARO.'' The homespun but attractive qualities of the Amato Opera's productions and the intimacy of its shoe-box theater offer a useful change of perspective for operagoers used to the big houses uptown. The casts here vary: at the very least, the singers are eager and enthusiastic; sometimes the singing shows great promise. And Anthony Amato, the company's founder, conducts the performances with an evident love of the music. The closing production of the company's season is Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' performed in English. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village; (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $25; $20 for the elderly and children (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>Classical</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There are few better places in the city to hear chamber music than this barge floating on the East River, with its live, intimate acoustics and its spectacular view of Lower Manhattan. Good weather will only enhance the experience, and the performances are often as fine as the setting. Here, in programs coordinated by Paul Neubauer, an excellent violist, he is joined by other fine performers, including the McDermott sisters. (Kerry, a violinist, and Anne-Marie, a pianist, perform tonight and are joined tomorrow and on Sunday by Maureen, a cellist.) The big piece tonight is Brahms's great Piano Quintet. Tomorrow and on Sunday, Robert White, a tenor, performs songs of Beethoven. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $23; $20 for the elderly; $15 for students (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BRONX ARTS ENSEMBLE. Carlos Franzetti conducts an orchestra in an annual holiday program in a tent on Sunday at 2 p.m. . The program includes seasoned Americana by Copland (''An Outdoor Overture'' and music from ''Appalachian Spring'' and ''Rodeo'') and Howard Hanson (''Romantic'' Symphony) as well as Mr. Franzetti's own Sinfonia from ''Corpus Evita.'' Woodlawn Cemetery, Jerome and Bainbridge Avenues, the Bronx, (718) 601-7399. Free (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>ELEMENTS STRING QUARTET. The group, founded last year, is new to this listener, but the program, centering on the fugue, is attractively varied. Inevitably, Beethoven's ''Grosse Fugue'' is here. So are Mendelssohn's A minor Quartet (Op. 13) and Bartok's Third, along with a suite of movements by Glazunov and Rimsky-Korsakov. Tomorrow night at 8, Grace and St. Paul's Church, 123 West 71st Street, Manhattan, (212) 904-1422, Extension 13. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>PAUL JACOBS. Students are naturally exuberant when they finally graduate, but this beats all. The day after his graduation from the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia two weeks ago, this young organist began a series of the complete Bach organ works, unfolding over 14 consecutive evenings. Here he presents the last two programs, both mingling chorale preludes with more formally based works, like the great C minor Passacaglia and Fugue (BWV 562), which ends the series tomorrow. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 288-8920, Extension 267. Admission: suggested donation of $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>MIDAMERICA PRODUCTIONS. This group's presentations could most kindly be called mixed. This concert is typical in bringing together choruses of no obvious distinction from around the country. But the program may be of more than usual interest, combining Schubert's G major Mass (D. 167) with David Fanshawe's ''African Sanctus,'' a 1972 setting of the Mass incorporating African music. Not knowing Mr. Fanshawe's work or the motley performers, one cannot promise more. Sunday night at 8:30, Carnegie Hall; (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $16 to $68 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NEW VIENNA CHAMBER ENSEMBLE. This Austrian group, consisting of a soprano (Joan-Marie Zimmerman) and seven instrumentalists, now two years old, has yet to be heard, so a reasonable level of quality can only be assumed. But it must be said, at least, that the ensemble is adventurous in its programming, juxtaposing composers based in Vienna (from Schubert to the present of Dieter Kaufmann and others) with counterparts based more or less in New York (George Perle, Donald Martino, Perry Goldstein and Edward Smaldone). Tonight at 8, Christ and St. Stephen's Church, 120 West 69th Street, Manhattan, (212) 568-4732. Tickets: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. The New York Philharmonic is winding down its subscription year with a program including the Shostakovich Seventh Symphony and the premiere of Lowell Liebermann's Trumpet Concerto. The Philharmonic's estimable Philip Smith plays the trumpet solos, and Kurt Masur conducts. Avery Fisher Hall, Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; (212) 721-6500. Tickets, $18 to $77. (Bernard Holland).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK YOUTH SYMPHONY. Mischa Santora conducts the young players of the New York Youth Symphony in Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola, Stravinsky's ''Petrushka'' Suite and a new piece by Gregory Spears called ''Midnight Pictures.'' Pamela Frank and Andy Simionescu are the soloists. Carnegie Hall, Sunday at 2 p.m.; (212) 247-7800. Tickets, $7 to $40 (Holland).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>AMERICAN BALLET THEATER. Kenneth MacMillan's ''Romeo and Juliet'' lumbers in this weekend in all its lavishly appointed sets and costumes. The star-crossed pair will be performed by Julie Kent and Vladimir Malakhov tonight, Yan Chen and Angel Corella tomorrow afternoon and Ashley Tuttle and the redoubtable Mr. Corella tomorrow night. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m. Metropolitan Opera House; (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $20 to $75 (Jennifer Dunning).</p>
        <p>CHRISTOPHER CAINES DANCERS AND SINGERS. Christopher Caines is not simply a choreographer but also a composer and, this program suggests, a cultural historian. His new evening-long ''Arias'' is a suite of dances inspired in part by the lyrical early European modern dance of the Art Nouveau era as captured in the dance photography of Paul Jsenfels in Germany in the 1920's. ''Arias'' is set to songs by 10 composers including Handel, Faure, Schoenberg, Scarlatti and Gershwin. Tomorrow and Sunday night at 8. Construction Company, 10 East 18th Street, Manhattan; (212) 924-7882. Tickets: $12; $10 for students and the elderly; T.D.F. vouchers accepted (Dunning).</p>
        <p>WALLY CARDONA QUARTET. Wally Cardona provides audiences with a sneak preview of ''Trance Territory,'' a work in progress. Described as ''a tribal ritual for the 21st century,'' it combines ancient rites with modern technology to affirm dance and music as transcendent spiritual experiences. The program also includes Mr. Cardona's ''Open House 01: Prime.'' Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Street Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $12;TDF vouchers accepted (Jack Anderson).</p>
        <p>ANN CARLSON. A choreographer noted for her unusual use of spaces turns the entire Chelsea neighborhood into an outdoor stage in her ''Night Light.'' History collides with contemporary life as audiences are taken on a walking tour through the area, pausing in gardens, back alleys, churches and apartments while dancers enact scenes from Chelsea's past; the evening ends at the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Reservations and information about meeting points: (212) 255-5793, extension 11. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and Chelsea residents. (Anderson).</p>
        <p>KATHLEEN FLYNN AND ALISON BELINFANTE. In this interestingly balanced program by two newish modern-dance choreographers, Kathleen Flynn will address the life and dreams of modern working women in three dances, one inspired by the iconic Rosie the Riveter, and Alison Belinfante will explore bizarre aspects of the circus in six dances that make use of a shared corset, balloon-concealing hoop skirts, a tightwire and crinolines. Tonight through Sunday night at 8. Context Studios, 28 Avenue A between Second and Third Streets, East Village; (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $12 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>THE KITCHEN: DANCE IN PROGRESS. This annual series brings newish and mid-career choreographers together for two months to create dances in a workshop atmosphere. This year's choreographers and works are Amy Cox and ''Waterfront,'' inspired by the Williamsburg waterfront; Andrea Kleine and an excerpt from a dance about identity and the photographic image; Amiel Malale and his minimalist ''Touch First,'' which explores  time's passing and life's surprises; and Meg Wolfe in a solo that uses movement and video to explore the externalization of personality. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-5793, extension 11. Tickets: $12 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK CITY BALLET. It was something of a blessing when the New York City Ballet paid tribute to the fledgling Dance Theater of Harlem in 1971. Today the company -- founded by the charismatic City Ballet dancer Arthur Mitchell after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to prove that blacks could dance ballet -- is a force to be reckoned with. Tomorrow night and Sunday, City Ballet pays tribute again, on Dance Theater of Harlem's 30th anniversary, with performances of ballets associated with Mr. Mitchell's career there, and a new piece choreographed by Robert Garland and Robert LaFosse, who were nurtured by the two companies. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. . New York State Theater; (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $25 to $72; $10 for student rush tickets (Dunning).</p>
        <p>TAMI STRONACH DANCE. A dancer with Neta Pulvermacher, Tami Stronach will present her own choreography, performed by dancers known for their work with Stephen Petronio, Bebe Miller, Urban Bush Women and Doug Varone. Ms. Stronach will present ''Love Particles'' and the intriguing-sounding ''Two Inch Pedestal,'' a solo about the impossibility of becoming the ideal girl. Sharing the program will be the guest troupes the Flying Machine and the Underfoot Dance Company. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Washington Square Methodist Church, 133 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village; (718) 384-1377. Tickets: $12; $10 for students and the elderly (Dunning).</p>
        <p>TANGO AND TANGO. Need one say more? Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 p.m. Through June 18. Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens; (718) 729-3880. Tickets: $20; $18 for students, children and the elderly (Dunning).</p>
        <p>TAP EXTRAVAGANZA 2000. An event that lives up to its name, Tap Extravaganza 2000 will celebrate National Tap Dance Day with performances by artists including Mable Lee, the Silver Belles, Jimmy Slyde and Dianne Walker. Flo-Bert Awards for tap artistry will be presented to Buster Brown, Savion Glover and Leonard Reed. The master of ceremonies is Ted Levy. Sunday night at 7 p.m. Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan; (212) 252-2927. Tickets: $23 to $52 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>''THEME AND VARIATIONS.'' Images from ballet, lyrical and full of passion, will be on view in an exhibition by the dance photographer known as Costas. The show also includes dance sculptures by Andrew De Vries, paintings by Douglas Hofmann and acquaints by Roy Fairchild-Woodard. Through July 1. Hours: Mondays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 8 a.m. Free. The Gallery at Lincoln Center, Concourse Level just beneath the Metropolitan Opera House; (212) 580-4673 (Dunning).</p>
        <p>KRIOTA WILLBERG'S ''I, RASPUTIN.'' Kriota Willberg draws from Russian folk dance, ballroom and etiquette manuals, stage combat, silent movies and political cartoons and lithographs from the time of the ''mad monk'' Rasputin. Tonight through Sunday night (and Thursday through Sunday nights  through June 11) at 7:30. Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue at Ninth Street, East Village; (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $15 (Dunning).</p>
