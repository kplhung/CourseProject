        <p>Edward L. Daily, the Korean War veteran whose unsettling recollections of gunning down civilians made him the most sought-after witness to the killings, now agrees that he was not on the scene, The Associated Press said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Presented with military records showing that he was serving with another unit miles away on July 26, 1950, when a group of civilians cowering under the double arches of a concrete railroad trestle were killed, Mr. Daily told The A.P.: ''I have to agree with your records. I can't dispute them.''</p>

        <p>Edward L. Daily, the Korean War veteran whose unsettling recollections of gunning down civilians made him the most sought-after witness to the killings, now agrees that he was not on the scene, The Associated Press said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Presented with military records showing that he was serving with another unit miles away on July 26, 1950, when a group of civilians cowering under the double arches of a concrete railroad trestle were killed, Mr. Daily told The A.P.: ''I have to agree with your records. I can't dispute them.''</p>
        <p>The admission came after two weeks of mounting questions about the credibility of the veteran who was one of nine named sources cited in The A.P.'s Sept. 29, 1999, report, which was the first to show that Americans had taken part in the killings. Last month, the A.P. report was awarded a Pulitzer Prize.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daily's admission came after reporters for the military affairs Web site Stripes.com and U.S. News &amp; World Report published evidence raising doubts about his presence on the scene.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Wolman, The A.P.'s executive editor, said in a statement yesterday, ''While we remain confident of the central findings of our coverage, A.P. is dismayed that Ed Daily cannot authenticate his account of the events at No Gun Ri.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolman added, ''Mr. Daily is obviously haunted by his service in the Korean War even as he struggles to understand and explain the version of events he provided to A.P., to the Army and to other news organizations.''</p>
        <p>In the wake of the wire service's original report about No Gun Ri, the Defense Department set up a commission to look into the scope of the killings -- estimates of the number of victims run from below 50 to more than 300 -- and whether the soldiers who shot the refugees were acting under direct orders. Mr. Daily was one of three soldiers who spoke of direct orders, either in the original report or on videotapes available on The A.P.'s Web site.</p>
        <p>The question of direct orders is of paramount importance to military investigators, because such orders would be likely to constitute a war crime. The A.P.'s original report said high military commanders had issued general orders to stop any refugees trying to cross the front lines.</p>
