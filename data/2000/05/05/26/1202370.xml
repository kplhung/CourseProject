        <p>Here is a selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>KAYE BALLARD, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. Now in her 70's, Ms. Ballard is performing in a rare New York cabaret engagement, an indefatigably gregarious one-woman variety show. She sings, tells jokes, does impersonations and even plays the flute (John Denver's ''Annie's Song''). Her latest act, ''Another Final Farewell Appearance,'' is a warmhearted tribute to traditional show business idols, including Henny Youngman, Jimmy Durante, Mabel Mercer and Alice Faye. Her voice may sound frayed but her singing conveys enormous heart and her ebullience is contagious. Friday nights at 8:30; Saturdays at 8:30 and 11 p.m.; Tuesdays through Thursdays at 9 p.m. Through June 3. Cover: $25; $15 minimum.</p>

        <p>Here is a selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>KAYE BALLARD, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. Now in her 70's, Ms. Ballard is performing in a rare New York cabaret engagement, an indefatigably gregarious one-woman variety show.

Her voice may sound frayed but her singing conveys enormous heart and her ebullience is contagious. Friday nights at 8:30; Saturdays at 8:30 and 11 p.m.; Tuesdays through Thursdays at 9 p.m. Through June 3. Cover: $25; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>BARBARA BRUSSELL, Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800. This blond Los Angeles-born cabaret performer wields a 50's-style glamour-girl mystique that encompasses extremes of innocence and sophistication. Although her show, ''I Wish You Love,'' has some witty changes of pace, it is mostly a ballad-oriented program that features a tribute to Lerner and Loewe and builds to a sentimental peak with Stephen Sondheim's ''No More,'' from the musical ''Into the Woods.'' Ms. Brussell has a small cottony voice, which she pushes to its limit and sometimes beyond, at which times her inspirational impulse begins to cloy. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30; Tuesday through Thursday nights at 9. Through June 3. Cover: $50, with $50 prix fixe dinner required for early shows Saturdays and Sundays; $15 food or drink minimum for late shows; suggested dinner arrival for early show is 7.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. This agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key. Her elegant, lyrical pianism is a compendium of 20th-century jazz styles, from Count Basie to Erroll Garner to Bill Evans and beyond. And her clipped, understated vocals, which verge on speech-song, approach lyrics from a wry but warmhearted point of view. Through July 22. Tuesday through Saturday nights, beginning at 9:30. From 5:30 to 8, Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Blue Angel Theater, 323 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, a creamy baritone who echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock focuses on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Today, tomorrow, Monday and Thursday nights at 8; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Wednesday at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55 (premium ringside seating, $75 and $80).</p>
        <p>* STEVE ROSS, the Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. Although this debonair singer and pianist is best known for playfully inhabiting the spirits of Cole Porter, Noel Coward and Fred Astaire, he also has an introspective side. And in his superb new show, ''Love and Laughter, Part 1,'' witty romps like Porter's ''They Couldn't Compare to You'' are balanced by meditative renditions of ''All Through the Night,'' ''My Shining Hour,'' ''I Can Dream, Can't I?'' and ''One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)'' that find psychological dimensions in familiar ballads. At his most lucid, his dry, self-aware interpretations make him a philosopher of fantasy. Wednesday and Thursday nights at 9; Fridays and Saturdays at 9 and 11. Through June 3. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at the Firebird, Sunday night at 9, James Beaman as Marlene Dietrich. Cover: $30; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>* BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 744-1600. Although his voice has its ups and downs, Mr. Short, now 75, still gives the best cabaret party in New York. For his 32nd spring season at the Cafe Carlyle, he is joined by a small, top-notch swing band, and he struts his bluesier pianism in the instrumental ''Moten Swing.'' Nobody puts a more vivacious spin on Cole Porter than Mr. Short, whose new show includes a boyishly wistful version of ''Why Shouldn't I?'' and the hilariously tongue-twisting, double-entendre-laden title song from ''Can-Can.'' Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Through June 24. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; $30 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>FEINSTEIN'S, at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. Lainie Kazan. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $60; minimum $50; dinner required for early show, with seating beginning at 6; late show, $25 minimum, with seating beginning at 10.</p>
        <p>CAFE PIERRE, Fifth Avenue at 61st Street, (212) 940-8195. Fridays and Saturdays from 8:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m.; Tuesdays through Thursdays, 8:30 to 11:30 p.m., Kathleen Landis. Sundays and Mondays from 8:30 to 11:30, Nancy Winston. No cover or minimum.</p>
        <p>DANNY'S SKYLIGHT ROOM, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 265-8133. Tonight from 9 to 1 in the piano bar, Jerry Scott; at 9:30, Laurie Krauz, singer. Tomorrow from 5 to 9 p.m. in the piano bar, Chuck Musone; at 7, Ginetta Bernard; from 9 to 1 in the piano bar, Mr. Scott. Sunday from 7 to 11, Sol Yaged and friends. Cover: free to $12; $10 minimum.</p>
        <p>DON'T TELL MAMA, 343 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 757-0788. Tonight at 8, Lisa Charles, singer, with band; at 9, Chris Puckett, singer, with Vadim Feichtner, pianist; at 10, CaSandra Brooks and Wende O'Reilly, music and comedy. Tomorrow at 4 p.m., Debbie Antola, singer, with Rick Jensen, pianist; at 6:30, Pat Monteleone, singer; at 8, Rob Pitaccio, musical comedy; at 9, Gay and Lesbian Comedy Fest; at 10:30, ''Poole Party!'' stand-up comedy. Cover: Free to $15. Two-drink minimum. No credit cards.</p>
        <p>DUPLEX, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-5438. Tonight at 7:30, ''Lighten Up,'' comedy revue; at 10, ''The Grodin Show,'' comedy. Tomorrow night at 6, Leslie Giammanco, singer; at 8, ''Bed, Boys and Beyond,'' comedy show. Cover: $7 to $15 plus two-drink minimum. No credit cards.</p>
        <p>JOE'S PUB, Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Akiko Yano, pianist. Tickets: $20.</p>
        <p>JUDY'S CHELSEA, 169 Eighth Avenue, at 18th Street, (212) 929-5410. Tonight at 11, Go Mahan, singer, in ''Astonished Heart,'' with Peter Kiesewalter, pianist. Cover: $10 to $20; $10 minimum.</p>
