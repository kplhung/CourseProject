        <p>Burt Perry stood slack-jawed yesterday morning as the police pulled bodies from the Wendy's on Main Street in Queens, carted them across a gum-stained sidewalk and put them into a coroner's truck.</p>
        <p>''If I wasn't standing here I wouldn't believe this was happening, not in Flushing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry was returning home from work, he said, intending to get a cup of coffee at McDonald's, two doors down from Wendy's. But instead of a quiet early morning street, he saw hovering helicopters, detectives in rubber gloves, an army of reporters and the news that seven people had been shot in the refrigerator of the fast-food restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry stopped and stared at his shoes, unable to conjure a rational motive. ''They just destroyed people,'' he said. ''I've lived here for 20 years and there's never been problems.'' A stinging quality came into his voice as he repeated himself: ''This doesn't happen in Flushing.''</p>
        <p>Beyond the shadow of Manhattan's skyscrapers, Flushing has become,  during the last 20 years, one of the city's most dynamic business districts, with stores and foreign banks and crowded sidewalks, having supplanted Chinatown in Manhattan as the city's Asian hub. Business people go there directly from Kennedy International Airport, never setting foot in Manhattan. Southeast Asians and Russians have arrived, too.</p>
        <p>It is considered a good, safe place to live. People go here to make money, not problems, residents say.</p>
        <p>''People don't go after each other like this, nothing like this,'' said James Deleon, 23, an aide to City Councilwoman Julia Harrison, who represents the district.</p>
        <p>While Queens has no true center, Flushing is the cultural heart of the borough. In a 1995 survey, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority estimated that on weekdays 174,000 people took the No. 7 train from subway stations east of the 33rd Street station in Sunnyside.</p>
        <p>The busiest station is Main Street-Flushing, the most heavily used station outside Manhattan, followed by those in Corona, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst. The Long Island Rail Road stops here, and 23 bus lines crisscross downtown.</p>
        <p>The Flushing branch of the Queens Public Library -- a new $32 million building with a foreign language wing -- is the busiest branch of the busiest city library system in the United States.</p>
        <p>The community has the biggest mosque in Queens and the largest Hindu temple in the city, as well as many Roman Catholic, Methodist and Korean Presbyterian churches and Jewish temples. Housing ranges from older Tudors to co-ops.</p>
        <p>There are more than 200 Chinese restaurants downtown alone and commercial space is the most expensive in Queens.</p>
        <p>''Twenty years ago, Flushing was down in the dumps and people were moving away,'' said Pauline Chu, the former president of School District 25, who came from Taipei, Taiwan, in 1980. ''People started hearing good things about Flushing and they've come to make their lives here.''</p>
        <p>Residents say they feel safer in Flushing than in any other part of New York. There was just one murder in the 109th Precinct last year.</p>
        <p>But workers at the McDonald's  say the killings have them scared. ''I'm so frightened, especially when you know they're still out there,'' said Mike Hyland, 40, a cook.</p>
