        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's disbanded Senate campaign will soon begin returning nearly $2.8 million to thousands of contributors across the country and will enclose with the checks a letter suggesting that donors give the money instead to Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is required by federal law to return this part of his campaign fund within 60 days of his withdrawal from the race but is not required to include such a letter bolstering Mr. Lazio's Senate candidacy.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, this will mean that at least some substantial proportion of the people that donated to my campaign will donate to his campaign,'' Mr. Giuliani said during a news conference in the City Hall Blue Room. The $2.8 million had been set aside in a separate account to be used only for the general election campaign.</p>
        <p>The mayor also said that he would campaign for Mr. Lazio in the Senate race within the next week but that he would skip the state Republican Party's convention in Buffalo on May 30 to avoid creating ''any kind of distraction'' from Mr. Lazio's presumed nomination as the party's candidate. Mr. Giuliani pledged once again yesterday to help Mr. Lazio, who entered the race against Hillary Rodham Clinton less than 24 hours after Mr. Giuliani withdrew because of his prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's actions are essential if he wants to run for office again in New York with the state Republican Party's backing.</p>
        <p>Even though the mayor dropped out of the party's critical Senate race for health reasons, there remains some hostility toward him over his protracted decision-making and the subsequent unraveling of his personal life.</p>
        <p>On May 10, Mr. Giuliani announced that he was seeking a separation from his wife but did not tell her first. Two days later, he strolled in an explosion of flashbulbs on the Upper East Side with his ''very good'' friend, Judith Nathan.</p>
        <p>John H. Gross, Mr. Giuliani's campaign treasurer, said yesterday that when the campaign finished paying its bills -- including the $2.8 million it must return to contributors -- it would have slightly more than $3 million left out of the $20 million it raised.</p>
        <p>The disposition of the $3 million is of great interest to Mr. Lazio and state and national Republicans. It is also of great importance to Mr. Giuliani's political future.</p>
        <p>Legally, Mr. Giuliani could keep all of the money for any of his future campaigns, or he could donate it to charity. Neither option would be especially welcomed by state and national Republicans, who are eager for Mr. Lazio to catch up to Mrs. Clinton in fund-raising. As of March 31, Mr. Lazio had $3.5 million in his campaign fund, while Mrs. Clinton had $6.6 million in hers.</p>
        <p>Although by law the mayor may not give the money directly to Mr. Lazio, he could give it to state or national Republican Party committees that would spend it on Mr. Lazio's behalf, ensuring future good will with the party. There are indications that that is what Mr. Giuliani will do with at least some of it.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Giuliani spoke to Senator Mitch McConnell, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, to discuss what could be done with his remaining money. ''There's a good chunk of change there,'' said a committee spokesman. ''Senator McConnell outlined what we would like to do if we had the funds.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Giuliani and Lazio campaigns, which have much to gain from mutual cooperation, continued their era of good feeling yesterday. Mr. Giuliani went out of his way to say that his campaign was doing everything possible to help Mr. Lazio's fledgling operation, and singled out his former campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, who has presided over at least three meetings among members of the Giuliani and Lazio campaigns this week.</p>
        <p>''Congressman Lazio has been effusive in his praise for the level of cooperation that he's getting from Bruce Teitelbaum and the people that work for me,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether that cooperation would include the Giuliani campaign's highly valuable mailing lists of political donors that fed the mayor's prodigiously successful fund-raising operation. Mr. Teitelbaum would only say that the two campaigns were ''continuing to talk'' about whether Mr. Lazio would get the lists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teitelbaum also said the Giuliani campaign took in $44,000 on Wednesday alone, all from people who wrote checks to the mayor after he dropped out of the race. All money received after Mr. Giuliani's withdrawal, Mr. Teitelbaum said, would be returned.</p>
