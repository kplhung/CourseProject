        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Taking On the N.R.A.'' (editorial, May 22) unfortunately sets the tone for battle instead of trying to unite all factions concerned with halting gun violence.</p>
        <p>The techniques of the National Rifle Association are no different from other interest groups, including the gun control lobby. I don't doubt the sincerity of the intent of the mothers who marched against gun violence.</p>
        <p>But I do wonder how well the existing laws are known to most marchers. Do they know that the number of shootings at schools is down, as are violent crimes nationwide?</p>
        <p>Programs like Operation Exile, where the federal government works with local governments to crack down on gun crimes, have more chance of success at reducing criminal use of guns than additional laws that sound impressive but won't work.</p>
