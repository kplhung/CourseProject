        <p>'The Summer Studio'  Ameringer/Howard Fine Art  41 East 57th Street  Manhattan  Through June 10</p>
        <p>Cape Cod was the summer life and subject of Hans Hofmann, who observed it for more than 30 years from his Provincetown studio and nearby dunes. In oil, watercolor or pen and ink, he went at it in many modes, from abstraction to outright realism. The works in this show vary from formal paintings to the merest of sketches, but collectively they have the exuberance of Hofmann's engagement with a very lively scene.</p>
        <p>In a group of small crayon and crayon-and-ink drawings, all untitled, one suggests a fantasy garden of growing things, from long tuberous vegetable shapes to snail-like creatures that frolic on the ground among them. Another, very different in structure, lays out a broad field of pastel Cubist planes against a corner of realistic old houses in black and white.</p>

        <p>Cape Cod was the summer life and subject of Hans Hofmann, who observed it for more than 30 years from his Provincetown studio and nearby dunes. In oil, watercolor or pen and ink, he went at it in many modes, from abstraction to outright realism. The works in this show vary from formal paintings to the merest of sketches, but collectively they have the exuberance of Hofmann's engagement with a very lively scene.</p>
        <p>In a group of small crayon and crayon-and-ink drawings, all untitled, one suggests a fantasy garden of growing things, from long tuberous vegetable shapes to snail-like creatures that frolic on the ground among them. Another, very different in structure, lays out a broad field of pastel Cubist planes against a corner of realistic old houses in black and white.</p>
        <p>A third is a still-life arrangement of carefully balanced squares, rectangles and anonymous object shapes. A loose, engaging comic-strip quality characterizes some of his small pen-and-ink sketches of local places.</p>
        <p>There are a number of larger oil paintings, too, from ''The Studio'' (1950), a crisp medley of large and small geometric shapes in sunny yellows, greens and reds inflected by a recognizable shape or two, to ''Orchestral Dominance in Green'' (1954), a dissonance of small, packed-together modules in jarring colors played off against larger, more coherent shapes on a big green field.</p>
        <p>Hofmann obviously loved his Provincetown life, and these summery paintings reflect it.</p>
