        <p>The Central Intelligence Agency said today that it had reprimanded six current or former officials for their roles in the agency's initial investigation into evidence that John M. Deutch, the agency's former director, had mishandled classified information.</p>
        <p>Gen. John A. Gordon, the deputy intelligence director, handled the disciplinary action because Director George J. Tenet played a role in the Deutch matter. General Gordon issued formal reprimands to two former senior officials and to one current one; admonished in writing another former employee and one current official; and orally admonished one other current employee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tenet was not among the six people reprimanded by General Gordon, but he has met privately with President Clinton to discuss a recent report on the handling of the Deutch case issued by the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. That report, which had been written at General Gordon's request, criticized Mr. Tenet for failing to involve himself more forcefully in the Deutch case to ensure its proper resolution.</p>
        <p>In his meeting with the president, Mr. Tenet ''acknowledged that he shared in the responsibility for shortcomings identified'' in the advisory board's report, the agency said in a statement today.</p>
        <p>The agency did not identify the current or former officials reprimanded by General Gordon. But it said that he had based his decisions on a review of reports by the agency's inspector general and by the advisory board, both of which criticized the same group of current and former intelligence officials who were involved in the initial investigation. The reports were particularly critical of the roles played in the investigation by Nora Slatkin, the agency's former executive director, and Michael O'Neil, its former general counsel.</p>
        <p>Others cited in the two reports included Frederick Hitz, the agency's former inspector general, and Richard Calder, its deputy director for administration. The advisory board also criticized Mr. Tenet for allowing Ms. Slatkin to take charge of the Deutch investigation.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. O'Neil and Ms. Slatkin were issued written reprimands by General Gordon, their lawyers said.</p>
        <p>''We sincerely regret and vigorously disagree with General Gordon's decision to reprimand Mr. O'Neil,'' said Roger Spaeder, Mr. O'Neil's lawyer. ''At all times during his employment by the C.I.A., Mr. O'Neil acted in the utmost good faith.''</p>
        <p>The disciplinary actions taken by General Gordon today follow a series of investigations dating back to the initial discovery in December 1996 that Mr. Deutch had placed classified material on unsecured computers in his home.</p>
        <p>After being passed over for secretary of defense in President Clinton's second term, Mr. Deutch resigned as director soon after the 1996 election. As he was leaving, an agency computer security official found that he  had stored the information at his home.</p>
        <p>The agency's security office began an investigation into whether Mr. Deutch had mishandled classified material in violation of agency rules and federal laws. But that inquiry soon bogged down.</p>
        <p>Within weeks of the discovery, some C.I.A. security officers came to believe that senior agency officials seeking to protect Mr. Deutch were blocking their efforts to conduct a thorough inquiry.</p>
        <p>A security office report on the Deutch case was completed in 1997, but it was effectively shelved. No action was taken against Mr. Deutch, and the Justice Department was not notified that he might have broken the law until more than a year after the security breach was discovered. In 1998, an agency employee told the the inspector general's office that the initial investigation had been improperly handled. The inspector general then opened his own investigation and notified the Department of Justice.</p>
        <p>In April 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to prosecute Mr. Deutch. But this year, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation of the matter. In August 1999, Mr. Tenet suspended Mr. Deutch's security clearances.</p>
