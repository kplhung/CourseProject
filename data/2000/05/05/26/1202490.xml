        <p>When Mike Schmidt left the country recently for a trip abroad with his family, he was No. 7 on the career home run list. He did not expect to be No. 7 when he returned.</p>

        <p>When Mike Schmidt left the country recently for a trip abroad with his family, he was No. 7 on the career home run list. He did not expect to be No. 7 when he returned.</p>
        <p>''Having Mark McGwire approach my spot on the career home run list is exciting,'' Schmidt said in a statement he left behind, ''especially because I know Mark and know he has a great respect for those who came before him and what we accomplished. That's important to me and will be to everyone on that list he passes in the near future. All Mark has done in the last few years he has done with class, and I'm sure he'll treat No. 549 in the same way.''</p>
        <p>When McGwire hit his major league-leading 20th home run of this season against Florida on Wednesday night, he put himself only 7 home runs away from No. 549 and supplanting Schmidt as No. 7 on the career list. His ascent on that list has been so rapid that great players have not had to leave the country to discover they have been passed.</p>
        <p>''To me, there's no one like Mark McGwire,'' said Ernie Banks, whom McGwire passed Sept. 17. ''I talked to Hank Aaron yesterday. He said, 'Man, the way these guys are hitting home runs they're going to pass me like I'm standing still.' His favorite kid is Ken Griffey Jr. I like him, too. But my real choice based on his record and the parks he has played in is Mark McGwire.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not McGwire surpasses Aaron and his 755 home runs, he has been the most phenomenal development of the past five seasons. He is the Babe Ruth of baseball's new era.</p>
        <p>When the 1996 season began, McGwire was tied for 83rd on the career list. The record 70 home runs he clouted in 1998 catapulted him to 20th. With his first 19 home runs last season, the burly first baseman passed Dave Winfield, Willie Stargell and Stan Musial. When he hit his 37th in San Francisco last July 27, he eclipsed Lou Gehrig. No. 48, which he hit against Philadelphia Aug. 18, sent him past Eddie Murray with 505.</p>
        <p>Mel Ott (511), Eddie Mathews (512) and Banks (512) were passed in the next month. When McGwire hit his 65th home run on the last day of the season against the Chicago Cubs, he left Ted Williams and Willie McCovey in a tie at 521 and ended the season as No. 10.</p>
        <p>''Mark McGwire is just a natural power hitter,'' Banks said. ''He has played in parks where you have to hit the ball solid to get the ball out of the park.''</p>
        <p>Banks, the Hall of Fame shortstop, recalled watching McGwire in his younger years in spring training with the Oakland Athletics. He said he was impressed with McGwire's size and his power and his ''commitment to play this game, his commitment to be the best power hitter there was.''</p>
        <p>''He didn't say that, but watching him develop, he was just kind of made for the sport, to be the best home run hitter ever,'' Banks added. ''I couldn't believe this man hit this ball this far and this fast and this high out of a ballpark. There's nothing you can do but stand there and watch.''</p>
        <p>As McGwire climbs higher and moves closer to the top, the totals become more spread out. In a two-homer game against Los Angeles on May 14, he passed Jimmie Foxx and tied Mickey Mantle. Not a bad day's work. In Philadelphia on May 18, he unleashed a three-homer barrage, leaving Mantle behind.</p>
        <p>Schmidt is next, then Reggie Jackson, who is 15 home runs beyond him, and Harmon Killebrew, 10 more home runs up the ladder. Should McGwire match or surpass his 1999 total of 65 home runs, which is not out of the realm of possibility given his early performance, he would finish the season ahead of Frank Robinson, too, leaving only Willie Mays, Ruth and Aaron ahead.</p>
        <p>Banks, 69, whose career spanned or at least touched the playing days of most of the top 20 home run hitters, pronounced McGwire the best.</p>
        <p>''Not taking away from our careers,'' Banks said, ''but we played in ballparks that were more conducive to home runs, especially in the National League.''</p>
        <p>Banks mentioned his own Wrigley Field in Chicago and Crosley Field in Cincinnati. ''The parks really favored us,'' he said. ''We've talked about this.''</p>
        <p>These days skeptics talk about a juiced baseball, smaller parks and pitchers who are less experienced or less talented. Banks said he did not know anything about the baseballs, but he said it did not matter what size park McGwire played in.</p>
        <p>As for the pitchers, he added: ''Maybe the critics say he's getting these pitches down the middle of the plate. We all got pitches down the middle of the plate. But we didn't hit them like he does. We'd pop some up. He hits them out of the park. His swing is the most modern swing I've seen for power.''</p>
        <p>McGwire, whom the Mets will see for the first time tonight in St. Louis, leads the majors in home runs even though he missed 9 of the Cardinals' first 15 games with pain in the lower back. His home runs this season have been even more productive than the 135 he hit the previous two seasons, because he has help. Last year the Cardinals had a 24-32 record in games McGwire hit a home run or two or three. This season their record is 12-5.</p>
        <p>When McGwire hit 70 home runs in 1998, he averaged a home run every 7.27 times at bat. He came into this season with a career average of one every 10.83, nearly a full at-bat lower than Ruth's 11.76, which had been the lowest ratio nearly forever. In the first eight weeks of this season, however, McGwire is outdoing even himself, hitting a home run every 5.45 at-bats.</p>
        <p>How remarkable a ratio is that? If a hitter maintained that average through a 500-at-bat season (McGwire had 521 at-bats last season), he would hit 91 home runs.</p>
