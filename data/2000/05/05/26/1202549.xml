        <p>BOCKMAN-Sigurd, 89, passed away Thursday morning, May 25, at his home in Annapolis, MD. He was a noted classical clarinetist and teacher whose career spanned 52 years. He played with the Minneapolis Symphony, the Pittsburgh Symphony and the NBC Symphony. He was also an original member of Leopold Stokowski's American Symphony at Carnegie Hall as well as the New York City Opera Orchestra. Other playing engagements included performances with the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra. Mr. Bockman performed with studio orchestras for ''Cavalcade of America,'' ''Theater Guild'' and the ''Bell Telephone Hour.'' He also played with the Firestone Hour Orchestra and for the Cities Service Hour in their coast-to-coast broadcasts. In addition, he participated in many musical recordings including the original score for ''Victory at Sea.'' Mr. Bockman was born in Seattle, Washington and grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He graduated in Music Education from the University of Minnesota and held teaching positions at the University of Minnesota, Carleton College, the MacPhail School of Music, Minneapolis, and he often tutored during summer sessions at the Chautauqua Institution. Mr. Bockman is survived by his wife of 32 years, the former Marilyn Modern. A memorial service will be held Tuesday, May 30, at the United Methodist Church, Davidsonville, Md. He was a man whose musical talent was undeniable, whose wit and gentle charm were unparalleled and whose place in our memory will be unwavering. In lieu of flowers, please make a contribution to the Annapolis Symphony Orchestra.</p>
