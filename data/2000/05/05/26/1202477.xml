        <p>It was just another Wendy's restaurant, one of dozens in New York City, with another crew of employees working yet another night shift.</p>
        <p>There was Ramon, who liked nothing better than to drink beer while standing watch over a backyard barbecue. And Anita, always eating salads to look good in the clothes she so carefully selected. And Jean, the restaurant's assistant manager, who recently asked his brother for advice about marriage; it seemed as if he had finally found his partner for life.</p>
        <p>They came from different backgrounds, and different neighborhoods -- even different countries --  but they were united in the entry-level path they had chosen to pursue a better life. They would move up and on by checking the French fries, stocking the condiment stand, mopping the floor.</p>
        <p>But late Wednesday night, their closing-time routine was interrupted. They and their four co-workers soon found themselves in the restaurant's basement, their hands tied behind them, their mouths sealed with duct tape, guns aimed at their heads. And a certain restaurant in Flushing, Queens, would never be just another Wendy's ever again.</p>
        <p>Ramon Nazario, Anita C. Smith and Jean Dumel Auguste were shot dead, along with Jeremy Mele, who at 18 was the youngest victim, and Ali Ibadat, an immigrant so solitary in his habits that the police were still trying to figure out whom to formally notify. Their two badly wounded colleagues, Jaquione Johnson and Patrick Castro, somehow managed to crawl up the stairs to call for help.</p>
        <p>As if sensing that the hunt for the two gunmen might soon overshadow the stories of the dead, friends and relatives of the victims paused from their mourning yesterday, opened their doors and shared grief-clouded memories: of earnest striving and young love, of proud moments and a pretty good Elvis impersonation.</p>
        <p>On the top floor of one of the six-story apartment buildings looming over Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, not far from Prospect Park, a woman's cry rang out: ''Why? Why? Why?'' This was the mother of Jean Dumel Auguste; her relatives refused to give her name, as if to suggest that such wailing was all that one needed to know.</p>
        <p>Mr. Auguste, 27, had great ambition, his relatives said with admiration. Born in Haiti, he had come to the United States in 1990 for the same reason that had attracted the rest of his family, his brother-in-law, St. Anel Saint-Vilus, said: ''Looking for a better life.''</p>
        <p>He found work at Wendy's, the fast-food company that has 4,900 restaurants and more than 200,000 employees throughout the country. For a while he worked as a crew manager at a Wendy's in Whitestone, Queens. His former colleagues recalled him as someone who would  drive them home after a late shift.</p>
        <p>In January, Mr. Auguste was promoted to assistant store manager and assigned to the Wendy's in Flushing. He preferred to work the 3-to-11 shift, his brother, Jean Elson Auguste, said, because ''he could do more business.'' Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president for communications, said Mr. Auguste had reached a salaried position that included a bonus incentive that ''is based in part on the success of the individual restaurant.''</p>
        <p>Jean Elson Auguste said his brother had called him a few days ago to talk about marriage. For the last two years, Jean Dumel had been dating Linda Pardo, 32, a nurse. ''He finally got the woman that he wanted to get married to,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A short while later, Ms. Pardo, her face wet with tears, looked past the stream of visitors to the Auguste family's apartment to stare at the reporters outside. She burst into tears, then went back inside.</p>
        <p>In South Jamaica, Queens, the relatives of Anita Smith sat on a stoop outside a small, three-story house, sharing memories that made them cry one moment and laugh the next. Ms. Smith, they said, was 22, a graduate of Springfield Gardens High School who had dreams of going to college. She was fashion-conscious, they said, with a discerning eye.</p>
        <p>After working the late shift at Wendy's, Ms. Smith would take a bus back to her neighborhood. ''I wasn't afraid of her working nights at Wendy's,'' her mother, Joan Smith, said. ''I was more afraid of her coming up the block.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith leaves behind her mother, a younger sister, two younger brothers and her maternal grandparents. Her grandmother, Pamella Truman, stood on the porch with odd mementos from her granddaughter's life, including a photograph from elementary school and a certificate of honor that read: ''Wendy's Employee of the Month. To reward you for your accomplishments in guest satisfaction.''</p>
        <p>In Flushing, not far from the restaurant, those who knew and loved Ramon Nazario gathered in and around the basement apartment he shared with seven other people, including his mother, his stepfather, his wife, Malgo, and his 2-year-old son, Ramon. They described a native of Puerto Rico with a Zorba-like zest for life, someone who loved beer and barbecues and who could defend himself verbally and physically.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nazario, 44, spent most of his life doing anonymous grunt work in restaurants, they said. But he came to life when he hung up his apron. ''He did Elvis imitations,'' his friend Rashid Sachdeva said. ''He would wear the tightest army pants made for his body.''</p>
        <p>In a modest ranch house in Neptune, N.J., the relatives of Jeremy Mele struggled with the loss, which they had learned of while watching television yesterday morning. They said he had grown up on the Jersey Shore, but had moved to Queens after graduating from Neptune High School last June to be closer to his girlfriend, whom he had met through  the junior Reserve Officers Training Corps program.</p>
        <p>Finally, in Ridgewood, Queens, Abdul Waheed struggled to remember the little he could of Ali Ibadat, the immigrant from Pakistan who, for three years, lived in the windowless, one-room apartment next to his own, in the basement of a building at 789 Woodward Avenue. He said the two men shared a bathroom, a small, dingy kitchen, and very few words.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waheed knew that his quiet neighbor had two teenage children back in Pakistan, that he had also once lived in England, and that he worked ''seven days a week, 12 months a year'' at one of those Wendy's restaurants.</p>
