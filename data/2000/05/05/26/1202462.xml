        <p>For years, as diamonds from African war zones fueled conflict, African diamond-trading has been associated with secretive deals between warlords in the bush and unscrupulous buyers who trade gems for weapons.</p>
        <p>As of next month, though, in a remarkable business deal, an African diamond company plans to sell shares on the London Stock Exchange, offering investors a stake in a venture that includes as partners the embattled governments of Congo and Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>What investors will be buying, essentially, are the pickings from a billion-dollar diamond mine concession, granted by decree from the Congolese government and guarded by Zimbabwean soldiers, at the heart of one of Africa's most troubled, decayed and divided nations.</p>
        <p>Zimbabwean troops have been in Congo since 1998 supporting President Laurent Kabila's government along with Angola and Namibia against rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.</p>
        <p>Shares of the diamond company, Oryx Diamonds Ltd., will be offered on the Alternative Investment Market, which is part of the London exchange, on June 13. The company is a result of a merger between Petra Diamonds Ltd., run from South Africa with registered offices in Bermuda, and Oryx Natural Resources, incorporated in the Cayman Islands but run from Oman. Shareholders are scheduled to approve that merger formally on June 12.</p>
        <p>The deal is thought to be the first overtly commercial venture involving two of the countries in one of Africa's most complex conflicts.</p>
        <p>It has produced a company keen to establish legitimacy at a time when Western governments are campaigning to end Africa's linkage of diamonds and war.</p>
        <p>Geoffrey White, the deputy managing director, said the new company had sought to avoid secrecy about its dealings in light of potential adverse publicity.</p>
        <p>''We have got nothing to hide,'' he said. ''We are a company that believes there's a commercial opportunity far greater than the risk associated with it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. White denied that the diamonds would be mined in a war zone. ''The area where we are is totally secure,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The company, moreover, has enlisted a former United States ambassador in Oman and elsewhere, Frances Cook, and a high-ranking official of the 54-nation Commonwealth, Moses Anafu, to join its board as nonexecutive directors, according to public documents. ''I'm very positive about this involvement,'' Ambassador Cook said.</p>
        <p>Its officers also include the chief executive, Thamer bin Said al-Shanfari, a 32-year-old Omani businessman, who has invested millions of dollars into the deal, and Adonis Pouroulis, a 30-year-old South African mining executive whose company, Petra, already trades on the Alternative Investment Market.</p>
        <p>Petra's shares almost doubled, to 80 pence, or about $1.20, when the deal was announced on May 18.</p>
        <p>According to a prospectus sent to shareholders, the company will own a 25-year concession on a large area 20 miles south of Mbuji-Mayi, Congo's main industrial diamond zone. A geologist's assessment in the prospectus valued the concession at $1 billion. The profits will be shared between the company, Oryx Diamonds, taking 40 percent, and two companies with ties to the Zimbabwean and Congolese governments.</p>
        <p>Osleg, meaning Operation Sovereign Legitimacy, a Zimbabwean company with close ties to both the government of President Robert Mugabe and to the commander of Zimbabwe's 11,000 troops in Congo, will take 40 percent. And a company called Comiex-Congo-Operation Sovereign Legitimacy, will take 20 percent, the prospectus says.</p>
        <p>Comiex is described variously in published reports as linked to the Congolese Army and to President Kabila. But David Price, a British lawyer working for Mr. Pouroulis, denied that the company was seen as President Kabila's personal investment vehicle.</p>
        <p>According to diplomats, bankers and others, both Mr. Mugabe and Mr. Kabila had close ties to it. The Congolese diamond concession, for instance, was taken by decree from the Congolese state diamond company, Miba, and given to Oryx with a six-year tax moratorium, according to Jim Williams, an independent technical consultant who prepared a report on the concession for the merger prospectus. Mr. Williams called the concession's kimberlite diamond deposits ''a future world-class resource.''</p>
        <p>The deal has nonetheless raised questions among senior diplomats here about two important political issues: how it will affect efforts to bring peace to Congo, and what role  it will play in the ferocious government campaign in Zimbawe to secure victory in parliamentary elections scheduled for June 24 and 25 -- the first in 20 years of independence in which Mr. Mugabe has faced a serious challenge.</p>
