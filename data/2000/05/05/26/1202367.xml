        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth last weekend for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.  ++ means discounted tickets were available at the TKTS booth for performances last Friday night only.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT.'' The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly unrelated vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer performances from Boyd Gaines, Deborah Yates and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as a Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $80 (Ben Brantley).</p>

        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN.'' Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $65; $25 student rush tickets at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''DIRTY BLONDE.'' Stand up, boys, and take your hats off. Mae West is back on Broadway in this compact Rolls-Royce of a vehicle written by and starring Claudia Shear. Eight decades after a play with the forthright title ''Sex'' landed her in jail, West is proving that she still has the power to shock and delight. She has also, not incidentally, provided the inspiration for what is hands down the best new American play of the season. This tale of an icon and two of her idolizers (played by Ms. Shear and Kevin Chamberlin) is no evening of mere impersonation; it's not ''Mae West Tonight!'' What Ms. Shear and her director, James Lapine, have shaped is a multilayered study of the nature of stardom. Bob Stillman rounds out the protean three-member ensemble. ''Dirty Blonde'' presents one of the canniest portraits on record of that floating dialogue between celebrities and fans that remains so much a part of American culture (1:45). Helen Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6262. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $60 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*++ ''A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN.'' Every time Cherry Jones and Gabriel Byrne make physical contact in this heart-stopping new production of Eugene O'Neill's great, elegiac love story, the floodgates open to a tide of clashing emotions. The characters they play, an earthy farm woman and a burned-out actor, are as opposite as the quick and the dead. But it is clear that each is wearing a mask that only the other can remove. What makes this ''Moon,'' lovingly directed by Daniel Sullivan, so illuminating is the extraordinary transparency of its stars: their ability to play, and display, all those layers at once. To watch Ms. Jones, Mr. Byrne and Roy Dotrice react to one another is to realize the degree to which O'Neill's play is about how everyone is an actor, a deceiver by necessity. Infused with both clear-eyed observation and a warm, luminous empathy, the performance's solid three hours melt into a quick-coursing stream (2:45). Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 and $70; $26 (at box office only) (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE REAL THING.'' This immensely appealing revival of the Tom Stoppard play, from the Donmar Warehouse in London, is a rare thing even in what has been an exceptionally strong season for straight plays: an elegant comedy of infidelity filled with the sort of comebacks that people only wish they were capable of themselves. True, Mr. Stoppard's anatomy of a cerebral (and anachronistically romantic) playwright, played with all-conquering charm by Stephen Dillane, is also always subverting itself, pointing out how some things, love among them, defy glib articulation. But, ah, how articulately it manages to say so. If its structural game playing seems a tad too clever this time around, few comedies have managed to have it so successfully both ways. David Leveaux is the highly accomplished director, while the delectable Jennifer Ehle, a standout in an exceptionally polished cast, plays the self-possessed object of Mr. Dillane's affections (2:15). Ethel Barrymore, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $70 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE RIDE DOWN MOUNT MORGAN.'' As Lyman Felt, the joyously eloquent, sexually rapacious and relentlessly self-justifying bigamist at this ride's center, Patrick Stewart makes a fine devil for a new millennium. A man who wants everything and can deny himself nothing, Lyman suffers as a result, but in the end, well, the pleasure of living his carefully maintained double life was probably worth its ultimate destruction. In intelligent and savage satire, the play makes a pretty good case for bigamy as a lifestyle choice. And it is the achievement of Mr. Stewart that such stunning amorality seems nearly reasonable. It's hard to imagine a more sympathetic creep (2:10). Ambassador, 215 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $65 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>+ ''UNCLE VANYA.'' Anton Chekhov, meet Henny Youngman. The director Michael Mayer's ill-advised new interpretation of the 1897 drama for the Roundabout Theater Company, which manages to dim even the luster of the extraordinary British actor Sir Derek Jacobi, seems determined to trace the borscht belt back to Mother Russia. This is a world of stand-up sufferers who never look more contented than when expounding on their profound unhappiness directly to the audience from the center of the stage. Get thee behind me, Stanislavski. The evening offers a few lightning flashes that illuminate the anguish in the forced frivolity, mostly from Sir Derek and Roger Rees. But by and large you don't believe that these noisy show-offs even know one another, much less that they are capable of inflicting deep mutual pain (2:40). Atkinson, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE DIRECTOR.'' This funny, suspenseful and entertaining new play by Nancy Hasty uses the con game that we call the theater as a means of exploring the more dangerous deceptions that exist in human relations. The power struggle between the director of the title, played with Machiavellian subtlety by John Shea, and his actors go from teasing sexual games to more sinister exercises that become literally a matter of life and death. The production barrels headlong toward the unknown, taking the audience along for the roller-coaster ride. A fine cast delivers excellent ensemble work (2:15). Arclight, 152 West 71st Street, (212) 279-4200. Mondays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $37.50 to $40 (Wilborn Hampton).</p>
        <p>* ''JITNEY.'' ''Don't put your business in the street,'' advises a character in this splendidly acted production of August Wilson's early comic drama about a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh. As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays about the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where private business is always on parade: real life is always the best show in town. ''Jitney,'' which has been extensively revised since its first production in 1982, could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality, and it is rendered with such stylish detail, that a complete urban symphony emerges. There are occasional whiffs of standard-issue melodrama. But under Marion McClinton's sensitive direction, every performer shines as a soloist and as a member of the chorus. It's the finest ensemble work of the season (2:35). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $41 and $51 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''THE LARAMIE PROJECT.'' An enormously good-willed, very earnest and often moving work of theatrical journalism. Overseen by the director and writer Moises Kaufman, the inspired talent behind ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' this more self-conscious production examines the impact of the brutal killing of Matthew Shepard, a gay university student, on the town of Laramie, Wyo. Eight actors play 60 characters based on interviews conducted by Mr. Kaufman and his ensemble in Laramie in the wake of the crime. The young, clean-scrubbed cast is more effective in creating a general climate of feeling than in summoning authentic portraits of individuals, yet there's no denying the work's emotional pull. The overall effect is not unlike one of the candlelight vigils described here, a stately procession through which swims a stirring medley of emotions: anger, sorrow, bewilderment and, most poignantly, a defiant glimmer of hope (2:35). Union Square, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Mondays and Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.;Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $35 and $40 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''SMALL CRAFT WARNINGS.'' Taking place entirely in a seedy bar on the Southern California coast, this play is Tennessee Williams's 1972 rap session of a drama. It fills the establishment with a recognizable array of Williams characters, from Leona, the lusty, needy libertine, to Quentin, the dapper homosexual screenwriter who arrives with a harrowing vacancy in his soul. The speeches evoke lives steered into dark corners, yet there is dignity in the testimony of these trapped sinners. As portrayed in this respectable revival with both restraint and electricity by David Greenspan, Quentin is the embodiment of some terminal sense of disappointment in the playwright's psyche (1:40). TriBeCa Playhouse, 111 Reade Street, (212) 532-8887. Mondays, Thursdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 5 p.m. Tickets: $15 to $40 (Peter Marks).</p>
        <p>+ ''WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE.'' In this shrewd and bristly performance piece, Eric Bogosian turns his gimlet eye upon himself and finds himself wanting, complicit in the cultural wasteland he abhors. The interesting effect is a kind of sympathy for the businessmen, drug dealers, evangelists, street people and suburbanites he has so memorably skewered in the past (2:00). Jane Street, 113 Jane Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Through June 11. Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays at 8 and 11 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29.50 to $49.50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>+ ''WAITING IN THE WINGS.'' There are few sights more warming on Broadway at the moment than that of Rosemary Harris being chilly. In this shaky but likable production of Noel Coward's deeply sentimental play from 1960, Ms. Harris plays a former West End star who now lives in royal exile in a theater retirement home, and her performance evokes a whole existence spent before footlights: every lofty, delicate gesture registers like a thunderclap. Unfortunately, Ms. Harris has been mismatched with the aggressively American Lauren Bacall, who plays her onetime rival with evident discomfort. And Michael Lang ham's direction fails to find a sure tone to smooth out the play's patchiness. Still, it's a treat to see such a fine host of veteran actresses, from Helen Stenborg to Elizabeth Wilson (2:30). O'Neill, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 and $70; $25 at box office only (Brantley).</p>
