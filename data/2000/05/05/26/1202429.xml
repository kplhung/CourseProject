        <p>School officials here apologized today to parents who were outraged by a health survey, given to some students as young as 11, that posed  specific questions about sexual orientation and behavior, drug and alcohol use and other intimate details.</p>

        <p>School officials here apologized today to parents who were outraged by a health survey, given to some students as young as 11, that posed  specific questions about sexual orientation and behavior, drug and alcohol use and other intimate details.</p>
        <p>The survey, intended to assess the effectiveness of the district's health classes, asked students a broad range of questions, including whether they were gay or bisexual, or had contemplated suicide, used cocaine or engaged in oral or group sex.</p>
        <p>''I am appalled,'' said Betty Najm, who said her 11-year-old daughter was perplexed by many of the questions about sexuality. ''She didn't know what bisexual meant. It's not taught in the health curriculum.''</p>
        <p>Nor should it be, she said. ''Leave it up to the parents and let them decide how to teach it.''</p>
        <p>Taking full responsibility for the survey, the assistant school superintendent, Thomas Mulvihill, apologized this morning to more than 60 parents who crowded into a conference room at the Schaghticoke Middle School for an emotional meeting. But many irate parents in this town eight miles north of Danbury in rural western Connecticut said the apology was insufficient.</p>
        <p>''I want resignations,'' said Tiffany Libardi, a parent who left the meeting still fuming. ''What I personally asked twice was for the resignations of everyone involved in the perversion of this.''</p>
        <p>At the meeting, Mr. Mulvihill promised to write a letter of apology to all parents that would be distributed with final report cards next week. In an interview later, he said the 95-question survey, which included queries about nutrition and mental health, was intended to measure the success of the health curriculum.</p>
        <p>''Our curriculum is a very conservative curriculum,'' he said. ''It basically preaches abstention from everything.'' He said health instructors wanted to know if students were using the refusal skills and other lessons taught in class.</p>
        <p>The survey was given during classes last week to all 400 sixth graders, 400 eighth graders and 1,200 high school students. Mr. Mulvihill said there had been no complaints about the survey at the high school.</p>
        <p>But officials decided on Wednesday to stop administering it after receiving complaints from parents of students at the middle school, where 11-year-old sixth graders were among those asked whether they had AIDS, smoked cigarettes or had ever brought a weapon to school.  Several parents said they most objected to a question asking, ''Have you ever had oral sex, either fellatio (mouth touching penis) or cunnilingus (mouth touching vagina)?''</p>
        <p>They also complained about the drug questions.</p>
        <p>''They have listed every drug known to man,'' Mrs. Libardi said. ''It's almost like they are planting seeds. Did you know you can sniff paint? I have paint in the garage.''</p>
        <p>Anonymous questionnaires delving into students' personal lives have become common nationwide, as educators seek to understand and prevent school shootings and other incidents.</p>
        <p>Some view the surveys as a way to  identify undesirable behavior, particularly in light of the criticism  school officials have faced when  problems that were undetected or ignored exploded in violence.</p>
        <p>But many parents have complained that the surveys are intrusive and provide children with an almanac of bad behavior.</p>
        <p>Federal law requires school districts to obtain written parental permission before requiring students to participate in any survey or analysis paid for with federal money that asks about sexual behavior and attitudes; illegal, antisocial or demeaning behavior; or critical appraisals of family relationships.</p>
        <p>The federal Department of Education, which enforces the law, is currently investigating complaints by four parents in Ridgewood, N.J., about a survey of 2,100 junior high and high school students last fall that asked similar questions about sex, drinking and drug use.</p>
        <p>School officials there said they had complied with the law by sending parents a letter notifying them of the survey, informing them of the nature of the questions and saying the survey was voluntary and anonymous.</p>
        <p>In the New Milford schools, which used federal money for the survey, officials said they, too, had sent a letter home telling parents about the survey and stressing that it was anonymous. But many parents complained that they never saw the letter, and that it had been sent home with the children rather than mailed.</p>
        <p>The letter told parents they could request, in writing, that their children not participate. It broadly described the scope of the survey, but did not warn that some questions would be explicit.</p>
