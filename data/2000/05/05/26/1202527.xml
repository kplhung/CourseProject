        <p>THEY didn't have to hand out a description of the injury to tell us it was plenty to worry about. You could see it by the way Dr. Norman Scott solemnly knelt by Patrick Ewing's injured right foot, and you knew it from Ewing's vacant stare. By now, we know that look, along with the familiar sad walk, out of another playoff game.</p>
        <p>It came six minutes and change into the first quarter, and everyone who lived through last spring was simply amazed, by the irony and by Ewing's bad luck. Game 2, Eastern Conference finals, at Indianapolis. A year ago, Ewing played with a slight tear of his left Achilles' tendon, right until the buzzer, when he missed the final shot of the game, his last shot of the season.</p>

        <p>THEY didn't have to hand out a description of the injury to tell us it was plenty to worry about. You could see it by the way Dr. Norman Scott solemnly knelt by Patrick Ewing's injured right foot, and you knew it from Ewing's vacant stare. By now, we know that look, along with the familiar sad walk, out of another playoff game.</p>
        <p>It came six minutes and change into the first quarter, and everyone who lived through last spring was simply amazed, by the irony and by Ewing's bad luck. Game 2, Eastern Conference finals, at Indianapolis. A year ago, Ewing played with a slight tear of his left Achilles' tendon, right until the buzzer, when he missed the final shot of the game, his last shot of the season.</p>
        <p>This time, the injury was called a sprained peroneal tendon, the top of the right foot. Yet it turns out Ewing also missed practice Wednesday. Why? ''Because the bottom of my foot was hurting,'' he admitted. Was last night's injury in any way related? Let the doctors explain that one after they announce the results of today's M.R.I.</p>
        <p>What we do know is that Ewing, who has always had a high tolerance for pain, was done for the night. The Knicks went on to lose to the Pacers, 88-84, to trail the Eastern Conference finals, 2-0.</p>
        <p>''I don't really know what happened,'' Ewing said after struggling to the interview room, all dressed in black. ''I tried to make a play to go to the basket. I felt something pull.''</p>
        <p>So here we go again and, when you think about it, when you consider the previous series, the Knicks were already on the same road they roamed last spring. It is always a drama with them, and, in Ewing's case, a prime-time medical hour.</p>
        <p>If you force-fed the others truth serum, you would be surprised how many Knicks would say they are better off without him. Sometimes they are, for a night or two, anyway. They were just about good enough to win last night, until Kurt Thomas and Marcus Camby collided going after a loose ball, allowing Rik Smits to power dunk and convert a foul that tied the game at 78-78 and signaled the end of an encouraging Knicks' fourth-quarter run.</p>
        <p>After their 102 points and 10 3-pointers in Game 1, the Pacers gave no repeat perimeter performance. This time, Austin Croshere short-armed so many jumpers you thought his right elbow was going to crack. This time, until he busted loose in the paint for 10 fourth-quarter points, Smits looked closer to retirement than he did to the finals.</p>
        <p>It is a fact that certain areas of the floor open up when Ewing disappears. Larry Johnson slid into his spot on the post and had himself an L of a time, spinning into the teeth of the Indiana defense for a game-high 25 points. Camby rediscovered his high-wire muse. Thomas had 10 points and eight rebounds and gave the Knicks their last lead, 84-82, with a left baseline jumper.</p>
        <p>But Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell -- again shooting fourth-quarter blanks -- failed them on their final possessions, and Game 2 slipped away. The Knicks will want to believe they can come back against these enigmatic Pacers, with or without Ewing, at home. They beat them against the odds last year. Yet if the latest injury isn't a temporary setback, it should be obvious to all that the last words the Knicks will want to hear from Ewing today is, ''Go get me my ring.''</p>
        <p>They can't get one without him, and if every player doesn't know it, Jeff Van Gundy sure does. Dave Checketts does. When the doors to the locker room opened last night, the biggest crowd was in the trainer's room. The door was shut tight. Then Checketts came out, his face ashen. Then Scott, the team physician, and Scott Layden, the general manager, who is new to the Knicks and their 27-year championship quest. Chris Childs, himself limping, emerged. Then Johnson, and, finally, Ewing.</p>
        <p>''I don't know -- I hope so,'' he told a friend who had asked if he was all right. He pulled open the door, waved off a camera and limped down the hall.</p>
        <p>In Miami a couple of weeks ago, it was quite the eye-opener to watch Ewing wrap himself in ice packs after one morning practice. The rebuilt wrist. The scraggly knees. The tender feet. With all of that, Ewing had been, for him, the picture of health. When he returned in December after missing the season's opening six weeks, the debate about whether the Knicks were better off with him or without resumed.</p>
        <p>For the big picture, the title picture, there is no debate. This morning, there is only the wait for more medical news, and a soap opera that never does end.</p>
