        <p>The Transportation Department, which has been trying since 1973 to find a way to reduce vehicle rollovers, said today that it wanted to publish a ranking of cars, vans, pickups and sport utility vehicles that it said correlated with their tendency to turn over.</p>
        <p>Rollovers kill nearly 10,000 people a year, more than a quarter of all the people who are killed in vehicles. Of the deaths in sport utility vehicles, 62 percent are in rollover crashes; for vans and pickups, the figure is just over 40 percent, and for cars, 22 percent.</p>
        <p>The government's main tool for safety is setting crash test requirements, but to reduce rollovers it proposes using a public ranking instead, based on the width of vehicles and the height of their center of gravity. The agency now uses rankings for front- and side-impact performance.</p>
        <p>''Empowered consumers will have added ability to judge more aspects of a vehicle's safety performance,'' Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater said. With the ranking, Mr. Slater said, consumers can ''make choices based on reason and reflection, rather than just the style and appearance of a given vehicle.''</p>
        <p>He and other officials said they hoped the rankings would encourage manufacturers to make their vehicles lower and wider.</p>
        <p>But some safety advocates said a better approach would be establishing performance standards. ''A highway safety issue that takes 10,000 lives a year and costs $30 billion deserves a more effective response,'' said David F. Snyder, a spokesman for the American Insurance Association.</p>
        <p>Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, whose petition to the government in 1988 for a rollover standard produced today's announcement of a grading system instead, said that it was pleased with the result, but that requiring live tests would have been better.</p>
        <p>''When we evaluate any product, we make every effort to test that product in as close to real-world conditions -- i.e., having the product perform its essential tasks -- as we can,'' said Dr. R. David Pittle, senior vice president and technical director at Consumers Union. Cars should be tested, Dr. Pittle said, on how well they perform and avoid accidents.</p>
        <p>The automakers have argued, though, that rollover tests do not produce consistent results. Vehicles ride on springy suspension systems and thus vibrate, said Gloria J. Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. They may roll because of the oscillation, Ms. Bergquist said, but if the government ranked the vehicles' tendency to roll on a course, and then changed the shape of the course, the ranking would change.</p>
        <p>The ranking system that the Transportation Department now plans to use consists of one-half the track width of the vehicle divided by the height of its center of gravity, a ranking called the static stability index. The department will use the scores to award stars, from one to five, to separate the vehicles into classes, as it already does for front-impact and side-impact performance. More stars means less tendency to roll.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bergquist said that might have some value, but that ''some issues are just too complex to be reduced to an icon.''</p>
        <p>But Joan Claybrook, a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and now president of Public Citizen, an advocacy group, said that resorting to a ranking instead of a rule was particularly unhelpful for the class of driver most likely to roll a car, young people who do not choose cars with safety in mind.</p>
        <p>The department estimates that 228,000 vehicle rollovers occur a year. Sometimes vehicles roll over in the course of a collision with another vehicle, but the vast majority are single-vehicle accidents. Of the 25,000 people seriously injured in these accidents, most are not wearing seat belts, and more than half are fully or partially ejected from the vehicle in the crash, sometimes with the vehicle then rolling over them.</p>
        <p>The agency had been working on a performance standard, but dropped that approach in 1994 because it said it could not determine a measure that would predict rollover likelihood. Since then it has been working on the grading system that was announced today.</p>
        <p>The safety administration, the part of the Transportation Department with jurisdiction over light-duty vehicles, including cars, vans and most sport utilities, said a grading system would be faster to implement, compared with a crash-test program, and that the agency was well set up to run it.</p>
        <p>The proposal announced today will be open for public comment for 60 days.</p>
        <p>Agency officials acknowledged that road conditions and driver behavior were big influences on the likelihood of a rollover. But a study of 186,000 crashes over a five-year period found that the stability index correlated well with the incidence of rollovers, department officials said.</p>
        <p>That study, based on cars built in the 90's, found that cars generally get five stars, the highest rating, or four; minivans get two or three; sport utilities, one to three, and pickups, one to four.</p>
