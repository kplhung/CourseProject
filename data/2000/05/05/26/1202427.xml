        <p>The outlook for passage of legislation defining patients' rights turned bleak today as House and Senate negotiators issued an unusually negative report on their efforts to strike a compromise.</p>
        <p>''These talks are stalled,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, as he walked out of a conference committee meeting this evening. Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said, ''We are making zero progress.''</p>
        <p>A senior Republican negotiator, Representative Bill Thomas of California, said that ''it's going to be very difficult'' to reconcile the bills passed by the Senate last July and by the House last October.</p>
        <p>''It's akin to mating a chihuahua with a Great Dane,'' Mr. Thomas said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas and other lawmakers said part of the problem was that House and Senate Republicans had not reached complete agreement among themselves on several major issues. For example, Mr. Thomas said that ''we agree to disagree'' on the number of people who should be protected by any new federal standards for health insurance.</p>
        <p>Many provisions of the House bill would apply to more than 165 million Americans, about three times the number covered by comparable provisions of the Senate bill.</p>
        <p>Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the conference committee, said, ''Most people would say the chances of success are not great, but we've worked very hard.''</p>
        <p>Today's meeting included 13 members of Congress and lasted about 75 minutes. Much of the time was spent discussing whether patients should have new rights to sue health insurance plans for injuries caused by the denial of care. Republicans repeatedly insisted that Congress must not impose any new legal liability on employers who sponsor health plans for their employees. Democrats complained that Republicans seemed to be worrying more about employers than patients.</p>
        <p>''We spent one hour in there, and I did not hear the word 'patients' mentioned once,'' said Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia. ''Everything is about one tiny section of the bill'' dealing with the liability of employers.</p>
        <p>Members of Congress said that there was no agenda for today's meeting, and that lawmakers gave no instructions to staff members about what to do next week, while Congress is in recess. The recess began this evening, with both houses of Congress scheduled to reconvene on June 6.</p>
        <p>Republicans said it was still possible that the pace of negotiations could pick up after Congress reconvenes. Representative Charlie Norwood, a Georgia Republican who supports the same bill favored by many Democrats, said he was losing patience with the conference committee and was seeking other ways to move a bill through Congress.</p>
        <p>''If we don't get a bill, or at least a tentative agreement in writing by the week we come back from Memorial Day, we must move past the conference,'' Mr. Norwood said. ''I am willing to pass this measure through any legal means that may be necessary.'' He did not give details.</p>
        <p>Likewise, Senator Kennedy said, ''We've got other options.'' He said Democrats could offer their proposals on the Senate floor as amendments to other legislation.</p>
