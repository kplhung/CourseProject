        <p>THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>A FEUD LINGERS -- It's no secret in Utah that Representative Christopher B. Cannon of the Third Congressional District and Representative Merrill Cook of the Second, both Republicans, are not the best of friends. Mr. Cook watched incredulously a few weeks ago as Mr. Cannon nominated a Cook challenger at the state Republican convention. So is Mr. Cook plotting his revenge? Who should show up at Mr. Cook's front door the other Sunday but Donald Dunn, a Democrat who is challenging Mr. Cannon. The Hill, a weekly newspaper that covers Congress, said Mr. Dunn stopped in for lunch and the two, acquaintances for years, talked about Mr. Cannon. Mr. Cook says that they chatted only a few minutes. And if it was Mr. Dunn's intention to fuel Republican discord, it would not work, Mr. Cook insists. ''It's irritating that Chris is the one member of the delegation who doesn't support me for re-election,'' Mr. Cook told The Hill. ''But that doesn't mean that I don't support the Republicans trying to retain control of the Congress.''</p>

        <p>CONSTITUTION PARTY</p>
        <p>NEWS FROM ANOTHER CAMP -- The Reform Party and the even lesser known Green Party are getting some national coverage this year, thanks to Patrick J. Buchanan and Ralph Nader, the front-runners for their respective presidential nominations. And recently the staunchly conservative Constitution Party, which is hardly ever covered, has been in the news, too, thanks to the conservative commentator Alan Keyes, a Republican White House hopeful. He warned the other day that he would jump to the Constitution Party should the Republican Party weaken its anti-abortion stand. Then Howard Phillips, the party's presidential nominee, announced at a press luncheon that his party had quietly completed ballot access work in 30 states, no small political achievement if all 30 are eventually certified. Together, he said, those states are worth 290 electoral votes, 20 more than required to win. But he is not running to win, he insisted, only to increase his party's visibility, expand its base and advance its ''true conservative philosophy.''</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>INDIANS AND POLITICS -- California is the state where the most money is spent on political campaigns. And in recent years, California's Indian tribes have become the biggest-spending interest group in the state, pouring about $114 million into campaigns since 1998. Why, given that Indians account for less than 15 percent of California's population? Statistics compiled by the California chapter of Common Cause show that most of the money was spent on a successful one-time effort to pass ballot measures permitting expansion of reservation gambling, a move that is expected to eventually make California second only to Nevada as a casino mecca. But the figures pulled together by Common Cause, a private watchdog organization, also show that the tribes are giving heavily to elect candidates, dwarfing contributions by all other groups in recent years by handing out $7 million. The second-biggest-spending interest group in the state, Common Cause said, is the state prison guard union, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association. Representing security personnel in the country's largest prison system, it gave $1.9 million to candidates over the last two years.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>BUSH DAUGHTERS' DAY -- ''I'll have a tear in my eye,'' Gov. George W. Bush said yesterday in Austin, Tex., as he prepared to watch his twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, graduate from Stephen F. Austin High School and head off for college. ''They mean more to us than anything in life,'' he went on. ''Today is a big day.'' Then, making clear that he wanted to continue the family's  effort to shield the teenagers as much as possible from the spotlight of public life, he told reporters, ''You all aren't invited, by the way.''</p>
