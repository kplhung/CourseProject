      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>SONIC YOUTH: ''NYC Ghosts and Flowers'' (Geffen). Self-exile can be a fruitful state, and New York's quintessential rock band tastes its gifts on this new release. ''NYC Ghosts and Flowers'' views the time and place that inspires Sonic Youth's breakthrough art rock -- Gotham, as shaped by the shared lineage of the Beats, the hippies and the punks.</p>
        <p>In eight graceful vignettes that blend noise rock and melodic musing, the band regards its own history through a cosmic viewfinder, the landscapes tinged blue by a distance that is both literal (half the band now lives in Northampton, Mass.) and emotional.</p>

        <p>SONIC YOUTH: ''NYC Ghosts and Flowers'' (Geffen). Self-exile can be a fruitful state, and New York's quintessential rock band tastes its gifts on this new release. ''NYC Ghosts and Flowers'' views the time and place that inspires Sonic Youth's breakthrough art rock -- Gotham, as shaped by the shared lineage of the Beats, the hippies and the punks.</p>
        <p>In eight graceful vignettes that blend noise rock and melodic musing, the band regards its own history through a cosmic viewfinder, the landscapes tinged blue by a distance that is both literal (half the band now lives in Northampton, Mass.) and emotional.</p>
        <p>Some songs are homages to elders like William S. Burroughs, whose painting adorns the album cover. Others ruefully assess the legacy of alternative rock. No one era or scene limits Sonic Youth's focus; the foursome is at its most holistic, mixing punk focus with compassionate poetic vision. There is room in this 42-minute album for many New Yorks and many Sonic Youths.</p>
