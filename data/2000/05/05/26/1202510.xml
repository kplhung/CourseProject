        <p>The Yankees' world spins faster than any other in baseball, from brilliance to darkness to brilliance. After experiencing moments of ignominy on this road trip, they will return in full gleam to Yankee Stadium on Friday, to play the Boston Red Sox.</p>
        <p>The Yankees thrashed the previously undefeated Chicago pitcher James Baldwin and the White Sox tonight, 7-0, and moved into a first-place tie with the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>Ramiro Mendoza, under the inspection of scouts sent here specifically to see him, needed only 100 pitches to throw the Yankees' second shutout of the season, and Ricky Ledee -- who will lose his spot in the lineup if the Yankees make a trade -- drove in three runs.</p>
        <p>From darkness to brilliance: The Yankees won the final two games of the road trip and improved their record to 26-17. They are on a pace to win 98 games. And Derek Jeter, the shortstop who is on the 15-day disabled list, is expected to play two minor league games and be activated in time for Sunday's game.</p>
        <p>Chuck Knoblauch fielded a grounder and flipped to first for the final out of the game, and catcher Jorge Posada tapped Mendoza on the back of the neck. It was easy to forget that in the seventh inning Wednesday, it looked as if the Yankees would lose their fourth consecutive game and fall two games behind the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>But in the last three innings Wednesday and the first three innings tonight, the Yankees' offense erupted -- 18 runs and 21 hits over those six innings -- for back-to-back victories to finish the road trip.</p>
        <p>Baldwin had been 7-0 and had a chance to become the first American League pitcher to accumulate eight victories. Quite simply, this was just one of those nights when Baldwin's stuff was lacking, when his command was poor. He kept falling behind in the count.</p>
        <p>Ledee doubled home a run in the second. Scott Brosius came to the plate, feeling better about his swing. In an attempt to prevent his front side from flying open in his swing, Brosius had all but eliminated his stride forward, and had a couple of hits Wednesday. Facing Baldwin tonight in the second, Brosius took a pitch out of the strike zone and blasted a high changeup for a two-run homer. Yankees 3, Chicago 0.</p>
        <p>Shane Spencer singled with the bases loaded in the third inning, Paul O'Neill running home, before Ledee rolled a two-run single to give Mendoza a six-run lead.</p>
        <p>Scouts from the Cincinnati Reds and the Kansas City Royals came to watch Mendoza. The Yankees have been asking around for left-handed hitters, like the Reds' Dmitri Young and Michael Tucker and the Royals' Johnny Damon. There was no telling what the scouts would see in Mendoza. The right-hander, after all, had not started a game in 18 days, and his control sometimes suffers -- his sinkerball sailing high -- when he has too much rest. He struggled with this in the early innings.</p>
        <p>But Mendoza, emboldened by the Yankees' early lead, managed to throw strikes, lots and lots of strikes, getting ahead in the count.</p>
        <p>''I came to pitch,'' Mendoza said through a translator. ''They gave me the ball to pitch, and thankfully, I did well.''</p>
        <p>Manager Joe Torre said: ''He really didn't get in any trouble. He really didn't stress at all.''</p>
        <p>Mendoza, who allowed only four hits and a walk, is 5-2 and has more victories than any Yankee starter.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>WILSON DELGADO slugged his first career home run in the sixth inning, made a few nice plays at shortstop and is likely to be back in the lineup at shortstop Friday. ALFONSO SORIANO was not part of the lineup again.</p>
