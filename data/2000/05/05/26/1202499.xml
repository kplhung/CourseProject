        <p>The two creative directors at the New York office of Wieden &amp; Kennedy are planning to leave during the summer in departures that mean all the top-office leaders will be new.</p>
        <p>The simultaneous exits of Michael Prieve, 37, who joined the office in 1998, and Stacy Wall, 33, who helped open the office in 1997, are coincidental, said Liz Hartge, a spokeswoman for Wieden &amp; Kennedy, which is based in Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prieve ''never had plans to stay in New York more than two years,'' Ms. Hartge said, adding that he would return to Portland after a sabbatical to work with Dan Wieden, chief executive, on special projects. And Mr. Wall is changing fields, Ms. Hartge said, as he joins Hungry Man  in New York, a commercial and TV production company.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hartge said that Wieden &amp; Kennedy was seeking one or two people to take over creative leadership of the office, which works for clients like ESPN and Nike. ''If we hire two people,'' she added, ''it would be great if one of them came from New York.'' Mr. Prieve and Mr. Wall both relocated from Portland.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Wieden &amp; Kennedy hired an executive from New York as managing director of the office, serving as the management counterpart to the creative directors. He is Matthew Seiler, who joined from BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, where he had been executive vice president and director for strategic services. His predecessor, Tom Blessington, who had left Portland to help open the office, has returned there.</p>
