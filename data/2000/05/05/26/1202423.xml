        <p>As the Israeli troop withdrawal settled into a reality, the Lebanese proudly celebrated a new holiday, National Resistance Day, with a jubilant rally today at the now empty Khiam prison, which is notorious here for the reported torture of guerrilla fighters by Israel's allies in the South Lebanon Army militia.</p>
        <p>Cheering, flag-waving throngs defiantly transformed the place that the Lebanese saw as a nightmarish symbol of their 22-year occupation into the venue for a victory party. The prison, it was announced today, will be preserved in all its sordid disarray as a monument to the misery that they overcame.</p>
        <p>A guarded hopefulness transfused the country as Lebanese tasted the possibility that they might be entering a rare era -- however limited -- without bloodshed. Beneath the hope, however, lay the fear that Israel's threats to treat cross-border fire as an ''act of war'' meant that the stakes were now much higher.</p>
        <p>''I was born in 1975,'' said Maya Abishaheen, a political scientist in Beirut. ''And all I've seen is war. Maybe this is the first day in my life when a bomb or a machine gun wasn't aimed at someone in my country. It is such happiness. But we are so afraid. Maybe now all it takes is a Katyusha rocket and they can wipe us off the earth.''</p>
        <p>Low-level tensions surfaced at the Israeli-Lebanese border as the exuberance here mixed with the palpable hostility toward Israel. In Kfar Kila, barely 10 feet from the Israeli town of Metulla, curiosity seekers mingled with guerrillas and free-lance hooligans to create an alternately festive and provocative scene.</p>
        <p>First some youths lobbed Israeli-grown melons, splat, back over the border. Then the melons gave way to stones and firebombs, the Israelis said in a complaint to the United Nations officials here. The United Nations representatives asked key resistance leaders to hold back their members, which they did, but the crowd was not solely theirs.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the barbed-wire fences along the border, the Israeli Parliament held a special meeting in the northern border town of Qiryat Shemona, where Prime Minister Ehud Barak and other officials said they hoped that Lebanon would see the withdrawal as a gesture of peace.</p>
        <p>''I appeal to you, President Emile Lahoud,'' Mr. Barak said. ''Let's exploit the moment. Let's talk peace.''</p>
        <p>But for the Lebanese, peace with Israel is not yet part of the vocabulary; it would be too abrupt. ''In Lebanon, the last shots fired were two days ago,'' said Timor Goeksl, the spokesman for the United Nations forces in Lebanon. ''There are a lot of dead, wounded and destroyed people. It's going to be a long time before their feelings of distrust and hostility go away.''</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Barak's extended hand, the deep-seated suspicions on both sides are mirror images of each other. Israelis see the Shiite Muslim guerrillas who fought them in southern Lebanon as hell-bent on violently challenging Israel's very existence; the occupation was their excuse, Israelis say, which is why the Lebanese are now coming up with reasons to invalidate the withdrawal and justify continued fighting.</p>
        <p>The Lebanese see Israel as a military powerhouse and occupier of Arab lands, which has now promised to seize on any provocation to re-occupy their territory or bombard them mercilessly. The withdrawal is not a gesture of peace, they say, but a delayed compliance with a United Nations resolution that ordered them out in 1978.</p>
        <p>A prominent Beirut journalist recounted, with bemusement, what her young daughter said when she told her about the withdrawal: ''Where will the Israelis go now, Mommy? To someone else's land?''</p>
        <p>The Hezbollah leaders, who have been careful to present the Israeli retreat as a Lebanese victory and not just theirs, are riding high. If outsiders like the Americans and the Israelis label them as Iran-backed and Syrian-abetted terrorists, here they are part of the social and political establishment.</p>
        <p>Dozens of Shiite Muslim sheiks granted interviews today during live coverage of the festivities, and they sounded as if they were campaigning. Indeed, with parliamentary elections ahead in August, they fully intend to capitalize on the moment. The Shiite Muslim parties now hold 32 of 128 seats; six of those belong to Hezbollah.</p>
        <p>In a scene that dramatized the precipitate changes of the last few days, Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, flanked by the Hezbollah fighters that his nation helped train, toured Lebanon's border with Israel. He drove at the head of a motorcade through the zone that Israel occupied until Wednesday, proclaiming the withdrawal a ''victory for the region and the whole Islamic world.'' At one point, the foreign minister left his car, climbed a hill and gazed across at Israeli settlements with a smile.</p>
        <p>Lebanese officials sent 100 additional police officers to the southern zone, more than doubling the size of the force to address the residents' fears of lawlessness. It was a sign that the government was willing to move into the area even if it was not ready to send troops there. But Hezbollah and other resistance groups far outnumbered the officials, and they manned the checkpoints and kept the order, even as their minions let loose daylong fireworks from their automatic weapons.</p>
        <p>United Nations troops, whose number will increase to 7,900 from 4,500, will not deploy to the border until the United Nations certifies that the Israeli withdrawal is complete and Lebanon accepts its certification. But today they ran frequent patrols far deeper into the zone than they were ever stationed, and nobody complained.</p>
        <p>Smiling broadly, the foreign soldiers in the blue helmets waved at the Lebanese flocking into the south like tourists. ''Good, good for you,'' a Ghanaian soldier kept repeating. Like the Finns and the Indians and the Irish troops, he did not hide his relief at spending his first day in the region freely above ground and not hunkered down in bunkers during the daily cross-fire.</p>
        <p>Stationed for 20 years on the northern edge of the zone, the soldiers also appreciated moving into the heart of the area they are supposed to monitor. Their supervisors, though, are wary about the thousands of mines and the unexposed ordinance that lie scattered along the border. United Nations officials here have secured maps of some minefields from the Israelis and made urgent requests for an engineering unit to de-mine the area.</p>
        <p>The United Nations' Middle East envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, met with Lebanese officials today to discuss how to expand the troops' role and ease the way for the Lebanese government to reassert its authority over the area. According to the Lebanese prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, Hezbollah will also coordinate its role with the United Nations forces and the government.</p>
