        <p>The Supreme Court today ordered the postponement of the election scheduled for Sunday, saying that the ''reliability and transparency'' of the electoral process could not be guaranteed.</p>
        <p>The surprise ruling was rendered after the National Electoral Council had conceded at a judicial hearing that it could not ensure an accurate, timely and fair vote count.

        <p>The Supreme Court today ordered the postponement of the election scheduled for Sunday, saying that the ''reliability and transparency'' of the electoral process could not be guaranteed.</p>
        <p>The surprise ruling was rendered after the National Electoral Council had conceded at a judicial hearing that it could not ensure an accurate, timely and fair vote count. No new date was set for the balloting, and the court ordered that all campaign activities be suspended until the Congress, which President Hugo Chavez controls, chooses a date.</p>
        <p>Addressing foreign reporters at a news conference here this morning, Mr. Chavez said that he favored delaying the vote for president and more than 6,000 other posts and that he thought it ''likely that this will occur.'' He acknowledged that ''serious technical difficulties'' had developed and urged the council to take the appropriate steps ''to avoid a disaster'' that would tarnish the country's image.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chavez, 45, a former army colonel who led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992, compared the situation to a baseball game in which ''the teams are in the dugout, the pitchers are warmed up, and the fans are in the stands,'' but a heavy rain obscures and inundates the field.</p>
        <p>''In that situation,'' he added, ''the smartest decision for the umpires is to postpone the game.''</p>
        <p>Polls show Mr. Chavez leading his main opponent and former comrade in arms, Francisco Arias Cardenas, by a comfortable margin. It is thus clearly in his political interest, as his supporters were quick to recognize, to avoid a repetition of the situation in Peru, where elections have been marred by accusations that President Alberto K. Fujimori is manipulating the apparatus to reduce the opposition vote.</p>
        <p>''A delay is not going to change the results,'' Luis Alfonso Davila, the interior and justice minister, said in a brief conversation with reporters this morning. ''No matter when the vote is held, Hugo Chavez is going to win, and win big.''</p>
        <p>Under the Constitution that Venezuelans approved in December, no elections were to have been held until six months after a new electoral code went into effect. But Mr. Chavez was eager to capitalize on his popularity and win a new six-year term. The newly established Supreme Judicial Tribunal, whose independence has been questioned by opposition forces, ruled that the restrictions did not apply retroactively.</p>
        <p>A tide of complaints about the ability of the National Electoral Council, which Chavez forces dominate, to administer the vote had been building. But as late as Wednesday night, council members had continued to maintain that the complete vote would proceed head on Sunday, ''come rain or shine, thunder or lightning,'' as one of them put it.</p>
        <p>The turnabout occurred after several days in which the members and other government officials had sought to fix the blame for the problems on the American and Spanish companies that were hired to carry out the balloting. On Tuesday, the council president, Estanislao Gonzalez, complained that the foreign companies had violated their contracts by failing to meet deadlines to deliver software and equipment. And he hinted at sabotage.</p>
        <p>In a news release, the American company, Electoral Systems and Software, said it was ''totally dependent on having complete and accurate data from the National Electoral Council.'' The statement said that some required data had not been delivered as of Monday and that the electoral council had requested more than 11,000 changes in the list of candidates to be programmed into voting machines.</p>
        <p>A series of other incidents that involved the state political police, known as Disip, had also clouded the picture and generated concerns about the integrity of the vote. News accounts said police agents entered the electoral council headquarters early on Wednesday and seized part of the electoral database.</p>
        <p>In diplomatic notes, the American and Spanish Embassies protested what the Americans called ''the unconscionable treatment'' of citizens at the hands of the political police.</p>
