        <p>The business side of the National Football League continued to change yesterday with the resignation of Howard Handler, the senior vice president for marketing of N.F.L. Properties. Handler is leaving to run Burly Bear Network, a cable TV network and Web site for college students, which is owned by Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of NBC's Saturday Night Live.</p>
        <p>Handler's departure follows the resignation May 9 of Ron Bernard, the president of N.F.L. Enterprises, which develops new media businesses and oversees N.F.L. Films. Sara Levinson recently resigned as the president of N.F.L. Properties.</p>

        <p>The National Hockey League has lost two executives within the past two weeks. Glenn Adamo, the vice president of broadcasting, is leaving after seven years to join Axient Communications, a broadband Internet network. Richie Woodworth cited the personal toll of traveling as the president of N.H.L. Enterprises for resigning after eight months.</p>
        <p>The league is also slowly recovering from an attack by hackers on its newly relaunched Web site, NHL.com. The F.B.I. is investigating the disabling of the site, which began over the weekend. ''We're coming back slowly,'' said Bernadette Mansur, the league's vice president for corporate communications, but the attention to this has created a lot of legitimate hits on the site.</p>
