        <p>It took Hollywood 23 years to turn ''Mission: Impossible'' into a movie. (The original CBS series went off the air in 1973; we're not counting the misconceived imitator that ran on ABC from 1988 to 1990). But it has taken only four years for the sequal. ''M: I-2'' opened this week with Tom Cruise returning as the dashing government agent Ethan Hunt whose latest assignment, should be choose to accept it, is to find and eliminate a German virus.</p>
        <p>Transforming television shows into feature films is an established practice now, as the wealth of television-based movies on videocassette demonstrates. Sometimes the series in question is still on the air (''South Park,'' ''The X-Files''). Sometimes it's only a faint memory (''Maverick,'' ''Dragnet''). Sometimes the idea goes wrong (''Dennis the Menace''), very wrong (''The Mod Squad''). And sometimes, as with the films below (to varying degrees), it goes right.</p>
