        <p>The European Commission said yesterday that it would probably have to take a close look at the competitive aspects of the UAL Corporation's proposed takeover of US Airways.</p>

        <p>The European Commission said yesterday that it would probably have to take a close look at the competitive aspects of the UAL Corporation's proposed takeover of US Airways.</p>
        <p>The announcement did not come as a surprise -- James E. Goodwin, the chairman and chief executive of UAL, had said he expected the deal would be subjected to scrutiny by the commission -- but it is another hurdle that the companies must clear to complete the $4.3 billion combination of United Airlines and US Airways.</p>
        <p>''I would have been surprised if they had said they wouldn't look at this,'' said James Higgins, an airline industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. However, the US Airways-United combination ''doesn't change the balance of power that much in the North Atlantic,'' he added.</p>
        <p>''It primarily improves United's ability to pull traffic off the East Coast,'' Mr. Higgins said, ''and traffic emanating east of the Mississippi produces two-thirds of the traffic across the North Atlantic.''</p>
        <p>United offers trans-Atlantic flights to six European cities from Washington Dulles International Airport, Kennedy International Aiport, Logan Airport in Boston, Newark International Airport, O'Hare in Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>US Airways offers service to Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid, Rome, Munich and Gatwick Airport in London.</p>
        <p>''Trans-Atlantic is by far the largest international presence US Airways has, but they don't have much international presence,'' Mr. Higgins said.</p>
        <p>Investors focused on the challenges facing United yesterday, casting a pall over the entire airline group.</p>
        <p>Airline stocks moved lower on Wall Street, and none fell harder than US Airways. The company's shares, which jumped on Wednesday after UAL's formal announcement of its $60-a-share cash offer, slumped $4.375 yesterday, to $44.625. UAL fell for a second day, closing at $52.50, down 68.75 cents.</p>
        <p>Shares of United's biggest competitors, the AMR Corporation, parent of American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, also fell. AMR lost $2.9375, to $27.125. And Delta closed at $50.4375, down $1.0625.</p>
        <p>In addition to worries about the implications of the merger, an increase in oil prices did not help the group. Nor did the performance of the overall market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Higgins of Donaldson, Lufkin, who downgraded airline stocks yesterday, said that ''given the uncertainty in the industry, investors aren't going to care about fundamentals unless they are negative.''</p>
        <p>Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said he was ''nonplussed'' by the move in airline stocks yesterday.</p>
        <p>''We think it is a good thing for the marketplace to rationalize the assets,'' he said. ''There is a lot of misunderstanding and hysteria going on that we have told clients to buy into. This is an opportunity, not a problem.''</p>
