        <p>The Finnish video artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila lives up to her Scandinavian origins, and then some. Her film and video installations are laced with domestic bleakness, mental instability and a sense of love lost, usually met with impassive and wry understatement. To this dour emotional core and documentary-like presentation, she adds elements of the fantastic and surreal, layers of shifting narrative voices and structural devices like repetition.</p>
        <p>Much of this comes across in ''Consolation Service,'' the subtitled two-screen video projection, 23 minutes long, that is at the center of Ms. Ahtila's second New York show. (It was also seen at last summer's Venice Biennale.)</p>

        <p>The Finnish video artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila lives up to her Scandinavian origins, and then some. Her film and video installations are laced with domestic bleakness, mental instability and a sense of love lost, usually met with impassive and wry understatement. To this dour emotional core and documentary-like presentation, she adds elements of the fantastic and surreal, layers of shifting narrative voices and structural devices like repetition.</p>
        <p>Much of this comes across in ''Consolation Service,'' the subtitled two-screen video projection, 23 minutes long, that is at the center of Ms. Ahtila's second New York show. (It was also seen at last summer's Venice Biennale.)</p>
        <p>Shot mostly in close-up, it begins in a marriage counselor's office where a young couple is coming to terms with divorce. It moves to the husband's birthday party, which culminates in a frightening accident: six people (divorcing couple included) fall through the ice of a frozen lake and apparently drown. It ends with a final leave-taking in the couple's apartment.</p>
        <p>This piece feels a bit long and ponderous, a weakness mostly balanced by its combination of harrowing drama and melancholy mood and its intriguing confusion of reality and metaphor. A more clear-cut indication of Ms. Ahtila's sensibility is ''Me/We, Okay and Gray,'' a 1997 installation that also depicts estranged couples and people under water.</p>
        <p>Its three 90-second novellas are startlingly evocative, and the screening of each on a separate, relatively small monitor reflects the artist's stated interest in contrasting real space with the space of film.</p>
        <p>Without this spatial element, Ms. Ahtila's work has a lot to compete with, from anything by Godard to Paul Thomas Anderson's ''Magnolia.'' She seems more than equipped for such competition, but joining the battle might render real space, as well as the art world itself, superfluous.</p>
