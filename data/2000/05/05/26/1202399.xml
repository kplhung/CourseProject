        <p>We were tumbling into a taxi, my children and I, bound for a Saturday matinee of ''The Music Man,'' when my son, Aaron, asked a question that I at age 8  would never have framed. ''Daddy,'' he said, ''is there any play that doesn't have music?''</p>

        <p>We were tumbling into a taxi, my children and I, bound for a Saturday matinee of ''The Music Man,'' when my son, Aaron, asked a question that I at age 8  would never have framed. ''Daddy,'' he said, ''is there any play that doesn't have music?''</p>
        <p>I stammered and finally managed, ''Of course,'' hoping that bit of paternal wisdom would end the dialogue.</p>
        <p>''Which one doesn't?''</p>
        <p>''Well,'' I said, wondering whether to start with Aeschylus, ''all of Shakespeare.''</p>
        <p>''Shakespeare doesn't count,'' Aaron announced.</p>
        <p>And with that I was silenced, for good reason. When it came to musical theater, I was far off familiar ground. My parents had always told the story of my mother going into labor with me during a performance of ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' so I suppose I was born under the star of dramatic tragedy. I had begun my theatergoing life at 5 with a concession to light comedy, seeing Menasha Skulnick mug his way through ''The Zulu and the Zayde,'' which did include a few incidental ditties, but the performing arts for me were always a serious affair.</p>
        <p>My mother's idea of a treat for me on the night before the last day of fifth grade was to stay up late and watch ''The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner.'' (Or maybe it was ''The Pawnbroker.'' I later recycled that image of Rod Steiger impaling his hand on a receipt spike in a story for a creative-writing class.) My high school mentor, an English teacher named Robert W. Stevens, directed a drama program that performed Shaw, Moliere and Shakespeare, not a musical in sight except when the principal pulled rank to direct ''West Side Story,'' a pretty highbrow show at that.</p>
        <p>As I grew into a passion for jazz, I came to learn a fair amount of the Broadway song book, but only in the interpretations of master improvisers. I considered part of the brilliance of an Etta Jones or a Chet Baker their ability to elevate standards above what I thought to be the schlock of musical theater. Sondheim was different, of course; he was a dramatist strangely landed into the realm of the Broadway musical by plate tectonics or some other mysterious force.</p>
        <p>But as a parent, I guided my children with a lighter hand, if only to appease my wife, who tends to exclaim ''Too intense!'' whenever I rent us a video like ''Affliction'' for a romantic Saturday night. My one attempt to take Aaron to the circus, for his third birthday in 1995, ended with both of us fleeing a deafening routine involving motorcycles, rap music and a spherical metal track that brought to mind the 1964 World's Fair's Unisphere. I knew I would sooner take my children to Metallica than the insipid Raffi. So that left Broadway musicals as a wholesome entertainment that even my highfalutin self could tolerate.</p>
        <p>The tradition began with Aaron's fourth birthday and a performance of ''Beauty and the Beast.'' The next year, I took him to the revival of ''Once Upon a Mattress,'' contenting myself in those days before ''Sex and the City'' with the chance to leer at Sarah Jessica Parker for a couple of hours. Two months after Aaron's birthday that May, my daughter, Sarah, turned 3 and I escorted her to see ''The King and I.'' She was sleeping across my lap midway through the second act, but at least my putative act of fatherly interest had given me an excuse to eat lunch with her at the Cafe Edison, a k a the Polish Tea Room, site of the greatest soup in the history of soup.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I was your basic deprived depressive. I mustered all my will last year to insist that my wife and I spend our 10th wedding anniversary at ''The Iceman Cometh'' when she craved drinks and dancing at the Rainbow Room. It's the kind of detail guaranteed to come up in any marital spat, lo these many months later, and I'm still renting Sandra Bullock movies for us as a form of penance.</p>
        <p>Something had happened with my children, though, over the course of our Broadway outings. They had circumvented my snobbery. For Hanukkah last year, Aaron got a scrapbook and soon began filling it with the programs and ticket stubs he had saved: ''1776,'' ''On the Town'' and ''Annie Get Your Gun'' as well as ''Barney Live.'' Alongside the boom box on Sarah's night table stands a stack of CD's that she uses as the soundtrack to pretend play, and ''The King and I,'' despite her nap that day, tops even ''Pokemon 2.B.A. Master'' on her Hit Parade. They both remembered the odd details of these shows that demonstrate just how deeply an experience has penetrated -- for Sarah the onstage taxi in ''On the Town,'' for Aaron the colonial flags decorating the stage at ''1776.''</p>
        <p>Well, fine, I'm a dutiful dad enduring the performance and they are children indulging a childlike taste. Or so I thought until we sat in the Gershwin Theater's mezzanine one weekend in August watching the Cathy Rigby revival of ''Peter Pan.'' Some kind of sense-memory kicked in. I remembered how NBC used to broadcast the Mary Martin version once a year and how guilelessly I watched it, aching to follow her and the Darling children out the bedroom window and into the night sky to Neverland.</p>
        <p>Last December, during school vacation, I took Aaron and Sarah to a thronged Wednesday matinee of ''Annie Get Your Gun.'' And when the moment came for ''They Say That Falling in Love Is Wonderful,'' I felt moved in a way I'd never thought anything could make possible except the John Coltrane-Johnny Hartman rendition. Is this what happens when you start needing bifocals?</p>
        <p>Now, on this April afternoon, we took our seats in the Neil Simon Theater for ''The Music Man.'' After the brief obligatory grapple for seats, even with me volunteering to take the middle spot, they dashed to the orchestra pit. With the first snap of the snare drum, they bolted back to the seats, perching expectantly. Sarah forgot all about sitting on my lap, the usual requirement for any prolonged stillness. By the third song, ''Trouble,'' she was humming along. Aaron pitched forward in his seat, elbows on thighs, the reflected stage light falling across his face. Oh, how well I knew that posture.</p>
        <p>Through the first act, I kept up a sotto voce annotation to every question Aaron and Sarah asked. What's a pool hall? What's a con man? What does Marian mean when she sings, ''Goodnight, My Someone''? In this crowd, abundant with children, my commentary did not seem to be disturbing anyone. Who would notice mere whispers amid the periodic yelp or whistle, the occasional syncopation of small feet padding up the aisle to the restroom?</p>
        <p>And I had to admit I was enjoying the show on its own terms, not just as an occasion to hold forth to my children, the ultimate captive audience. I smiled at the visual puns of Susan Stroman's production, the brief tableaux of ''American Gothic'' and ''Washington Crossing the Delaware.'' I appreciated just how subversive were elements of Meredith Willson's script. His River City, where the mayor owns the pool hall and the con man is the most genuine guy in town, seemed not so different in tone from the small-minded Midwest of William Inge, one of my favorite writers, in ''Picnic'' and  ''Come Back, Little Sheba.''</p>
        <p>For Aaron and Sarah, the viscera ruled. At intermission, they pinwheeled around the lounge in imitation of Ms. Stroman's choreography for ''76 Trombones.'' When I took Sarah to the restroom midway through Act II, we had to wait at the back of the orchestra section for a  break to retake our seats. She used the freedom to mimic the springy dancing in ''Shipoopi.''</p>
        <p>Late in the show Craig Bierko as Harold Hill, the music man, and Rebecca Luker as Marian met on a footbridge to share the duet of ''Till There Was You.'' I remembered myself squeaking through a version of it 35 years earlier during my weekly clarinet lesson on Mr. Atkinson's sun porch. I remembered the Beatles -- the Beatles themselves -- doing a cover version. When Ms. Luker's voice leaped an octave above the note she had just struck, I quivered, both from the musicality and the full-throated romance.</p>
        <p>Ten minutes later, the curtain calls were over and my children and I were heading for a theater-memorabilia store to buy a CD of the original cast with Robert Preston. I had to marvel at what aficionados they had become. Aaron was so familiar with the Polish Tea Room, the favored lunch spot for Broadway insiders, that when his aunt from Chicago visited and began waxing about the Russian Tea Room, he confided to me that you could tell she was an out-of-towner because she got the name of the place wrong. Then again, he did read the marquee on ''Les Miserables'' phonetically, as if it were describing a relative state of despair.</p>
        <p>Me, I was abashed. I understood the normal flow of influence from a father to his children, the way I had introduced mine to jazz and pro football. It had come as a surprise, though, that they could reverse the engines and teach me. And what I knew, by watching through their eyes the Broadway musicals I had once dismissed as spun sugar, was that it took the knowledge of life in all its complicated fullness to create onstage such indelible portraits of innocence.</p>
