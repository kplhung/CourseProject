        <p>Editors' Note: Carl Friedan's May 18 letter, denying contention in May 11 interview with his former wife, Betty Friedan, that he abused her, should not have been printed above letter from another reader, who assumed truth of accusation; placement seemed to undercut Carl Friedan's denial</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in the House &amp; Home section on May 11 reported on an extensive interview with the author Betty Friedan.</p>
        <p>In the fourth paragraph, it recounted her assertions in a recently published memoir, ''Life So Far,'' that her former husband, Carl Friedan, had physically abused her. In the 23rd paragraph, the article noted that Mr. Friedan could not be reached for comment on her accusation. (His telephone number, although officially listed, was missing from several directory assistance databases.)</p>
        <p>In fairness, in view of the seriousness of the accusation, The Times should have sought Mr. Friedan's response in person or by mail, and should have quoted him early in the article.</p>
        <p>A week after the interview appeared, the section published a letter from Mr. Friedan in which he called the accusation ''blatantly untrue'' and added, ''Never in my life have I ever gratuitously struck anyone.'' But Mr. Friedan's letter was printed just above one from another reader, who assumed the truth of the accusation, and the placement seemed to undercut his denial. The juxtaposition should not have occurred.</p>
