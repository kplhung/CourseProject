        <p>History is not on the side of the Devils.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has played in seven Game 7's, winning only twice and losing five times, including last year to Pittsburgh in the first round. On Friday night they will face the Philadelphia Flyers in the deciding game of their Eastern Conference finals. The survivor will play the winner of the Colorado-Dallas series.</p>
        <p>The Devils trailed the Flyers, three games to one, but rallied for consecutive victories to set up Friday's showdown.</p>
        <p>''There is a lot of confidence around here after what we did the last two games and people had taken us for dead,'' Jason Arnott said today after a team meeting. ''We've had so much fun coming this far, we didn't want to blow it now.''</p>
        <p>The Flyers have been involved nine Game 7's and have won five. Their last was in 1989, when they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Patrick Division semifinals.</p>
        <p>The Devils' captain, Scott Stevens, a dominant figure in this series, agreed that the Devils seemed to be responding better when presented with a huge challenge. He considered Friday's game as big a challenge as any for the Devils.</p>
        <p>''We battled back after facing elimination in two games and we'll try to do it three games in a row,'' Stevens said. ''What we have to do is focus on the next game, the present, not next week, or say it's great we've come this far from 3-1 down.''</p>
        <p>After the Flyers defeated the Devils, 3-1, at Continental Arena in Game 4 to take a three-games-to-one lead, Coach Larry Robinson went on a tirade. The criticism lit a fire under his players, who gave credit to their coach for spurring them to the two victories.</p>
        <p>Robinson said today that he did not have to tell his players anything before Friday night's game at Philadelphia, where the Devils have won twice in this series.</p>
        <p>''Focus is the key word here,'' he said. ''All I can say is that we're going into an unfriendly building and it's important to have a good start.''</p>
        <p>Martin Brodeur remembered the unfriendliness of the Flyers' fans at First Union Center, where several Devils fans were beaten at the end of Game 1, a 4-1 victory for the Devils.</p>
        <p>Brodeur is aware that the Flyers tightened security after several incidents in the first game, but he could not help laughing about it: ''That building is a factor for my family. They're scared to go.''</p>
        <p>As for the his role in such a crucial game, Brodeur said: ''I can't say I will be the one to make a difference. I can't be the one to decide which way the game will be played. If I give the guys a chance to win, they'll probably win.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur said that one deciding game stood out in his career, one that every hockey fan in the metropolitan area knows. That, of course, is the 1994 Eastern Conference final, when the Rangers' Stephane Matteau scored in overtime at Madison Square Garden during New York's drive to the Stanley Cup title.</p>
        <p>''Every time I go to New York I hear the guy's name,'' Brodeur said of Matteau, who now plays for San Jose.</p>
        <p>Stevens recalled that overtime loss to the Rangers and said he hoped that some of his teammates also remembered because it could help against the Flyers.</p>
        <p>''I was very depressed after that,'' Stevens said. ''Nothing was more devastating after that -- except, maybe, when we didn't make the playoffs after winning'' the Stanley Cup in 1995.</p>
        <p>The Devils went on to capture the Stanley Cup in 1995 by sweeping Detroit in the finals after eliminating the Flyers in the Eastern finals. One game again separates them for the trip to the Stanley Cup finals, and it is an opportunity they do not want to waste.</p>
        <p>''We cannot get comfortable with the two wins,'' Bobby Holik said about tying the series. ''Nothing will make us happy but a win.''</p>
