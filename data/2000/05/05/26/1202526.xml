        <p>It was just past closing time Wednesday night at the Wendy's on Main Street in Flushing, Queens. Two men, one short and one tall, knocked at the locked front door, calling out for the manager by name.</p>
        <p>The 27-year-old manager, Jean Dumel Auguste, seemed to know the men, and he led at least one of them down to the store basement where he kept a small office near the employee changing rooms and a large walk-in freezer unit.</p>
        <p>Not long after, Mr. Auguste used the store's intercom system to summon his small night crew down into the basement for a meeting. Six employees made their way down the back stairs into the cool, musty basement.</p>
        <p>It was a death trap.</p>
        <p>Minutes later, on one of the busiest strips in Queens, a massacre began to unfold -- a crime so grisly, so ruthless that it left some of the city's most experienced homicide investigators sickened. When it was over Wednesday night, all seven employees had been shot, all of them at close range, all in the head. Five were killed, including Mr. Auguste. A sixth was fighting for his life last night, and the seventh miraculously survived, his cheeks pierced by a bullet.</p>
        <p>''This is the most horrendous crime scene I've ever witnessed in my nine years as district attorney of this county, and as people know I've been to a lot of crime scenes,'' Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said yesterday, as hundreds of police officers hunted the city for two suspects, and as relatives, stricken with shock and grief, gathered at a nearby Sheraton Hotel.</p>
        <p>Investigators said yesterday that the crime appeared to have been carefully planned and timed, and they thought one of the gunmen either had worked at the restaurant or knew someone who did because of their knowledge about how the place operated. ''They knew too much about Wendy's and how things worked there,'' one official said.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said yesterday afternoon that they were pursuing several possible suspects, including a 36-year-old man, a former employee at the Wendy's in Flushing, who was arrested last summer in connection with a robbery at a McDonald's in Queens. The man, who had also worked at the McDonald's, was on probation at the time for a 1996 burglary of a Manhattan fast food restaurant. In the 1996 case, law enforcement officials said, the man used a cutting tool to break into the restaurant's safe. In the 1999 case, the man was released in August on $3,500 bail, but then did not show up for court appearances and a warrant was issued for his arrest.</p>
        <p>Police officials offered this description of the gunmen: One was a black man in his 20's, about 6 feet tall, who was wearing brown sweat pants and a brown sweatshirt. The other was a black man in his 30's, about 5 feet 5 inches tall, who was wearing a black jacket and blue jeans. The Police Department's leading suspect, whose driver's license lists him as 5 feet 5 inches tall, has been identified by at least one witness from an array of police file photos. Another witness, however, could not identify the man.</p>
        <p>Customers said yesterday that in the moments before the restaurant's closing time, there was no hint at all of what was to come.</p>
        <p>A young couple sat at a front table, quietly finishing their food. One employee went about emptying trash bins. Others wiped down tables and counters. At 10:55 p.m., a regular walked in and ordered one of the night's last meals, a junior bacon cheeseburger, a baked potato with sour cream and chives and a salad.</p>
        <p>By 11 p.m., the store was empty but for seven employees, and the front door was locked. In the most haunting disclosure yesterday, investigators said that a passing police officer tried to stop in for a hamburger shortly after closing time but was shooed away. A senior police official said the officer reported that he was waved away by a man and a woman standing at the door.</p>
        <p>''We think it's very possible that could have been the robber standing there with the female,'' the official said. ''The cop tells us there is a guy and a girl standing at the door saying we're closed. His sense was they seemed friendly. But could he have been standing there with a gun at her back? It's possible.''</p>
        <p>Once in the basement, Mr. Auguste and the employees -- Ramon Nazario, 44; Anita C. Smith, 23; Jeremy Mele, 18; Ali Ibadat, 40; Patrick Castro, 23; and Jaquione Johnson, 18 -- were quickly subdued at gunpoint, police officials said. The gunmen used duct tape to bind hands behind backs and gag mouths. At some point, plastic bags were slipped over the heads of all seven employees, and they were forced into the large walk-in unit that combines a refrigerator section and freezer section. And then they began to shoot, apparently determined to leave no witnesses to their theft of as much as $2,000.</p>
        <p>It was unclear last night how the men made their getaway. Police officials said they thought the two men might have slipped out a side door. But a woman at a nearby bus stop told the police she saw two men leave from the front door.</p>
        <p>Over the next 90 minutes or so, two of the wounded, Mr. Castro and Mr. Johnson, worked themselves free. Mr. Castro called 911 from a basement telephone in the manager's office. ''We're in the basement,'' he managed to say, despite the bullet wounds to his cheeks. ''We're locked in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson considered Mr. Castro his closest friend at Wendy's, Mr. Johnson's family said. The two sometimes walked home together. Now, Mr. Castro dragged Mr. Johnson upstairs, where they waited for the police by the front counter. Mr. Johnson, who had a bullet lodged near the top of his skull, was in Mr. Castro's arms. According to police investigators, Mr. Castro was in such a daze that he did not even realize he had been shot in the mouth.</p>
        <p>The first officers arrived at 12:52 a.m. The first paramedics arrived a minute later. Seeing two wounded men inside, the officers smashed the glass of the locked front door.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Johnson and Mr. Castro were taken to the hospital, the officers followed a trail of blood down the stairs to the basement, where they confronted a terrible carnage in the walk-in refrigerator. There was blood everywhere -- on the walls, on the floor, on boxes of food. Four of the employees were already dead. A fifth died on the way to New York Hospital Medical Center in Queens.</p>
        <p>Four of the employees were found inside the refrigerator part of the walk-in unit. One of the dead was found sitting on the floor outside the unit, propped up against the wall. An investigator said it appeared as if the man were taking a nap.</p>
        <p>One of the first Emergency Medical Service paramedics on the scene described his reaction to a superior. ''He said to me, 'You trained for this, You're prepared for this. But you're never prepared for this. These were kids. They were teenagers. This was a massacre.' ''</p>
        <p>Police officials said that based on shell casings found in the basement, they thought the weapon used in the shootings was a .380-caliber semiautomatic handgun. Police said they were unsure whether more than one .380 was used in the attack.</p>
        <p>One senior police official said: ''These certainly aren't the smartest guys in the world -- to shoot seven people to rob a Wendy's? I think they were going with the old gangster philosophy of dead men tell no tales.''</p>
        <p>As the day wore on, and as the hours ticked by without an arrest, relatives were left to cope with the twin burdens of grief and fear.</p>
        <p>Yesterday morning, members of Jaquione Johnson's large family filed into the waiting room of the intensive care unit at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. Some roamed the halls, pacing and awaiting word from doctors, who were still operating. ''Doctors said he can't move his right side at all, but he has sensation in it,'' his aunt, Regina Johnson, said. ''His teeth are completely shattered.''</p>
        <p>At the restaurant, a co-worker, Olga Purdie, whose 2 p.m.-to-9 p.m. shift overlaps with the victims', rattled off their names and burst into tears. ''Jean, Ramon, Ali, Jeremy, Anita, Jaquione,'' she sobbed. ''They were my co-workers. They were my friends.''</p>
        <p>Last night, two detectives were sent to Mr. Castro's home to protect their leading witness in the case. ''We fear for his life,'' a friend said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown, the district attorney, spent three hours at the scene and promised ''a full-court press'' to arrest the culprits. The killings were the worst in the city since five Bronx relatives were shot and stabbed to death in March.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown noted that the death penalty was one possible punishment for Wednesday's shootings, and Wendy's officials quickly pledged a $50,000 reward for information leading arrests.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani pledged another $10,000. Mr. Giuliani did not visit the crime scene, but in a City Hall press conference, he seized on the shooting to defend his buildup of the Police Department.</p>
        <p>At the crime scene, city workers pumped out sewer lines, searching for a weapon, clothing, anything that might be a clue. Police dogs and their handlers methodically searched for some faint scent of the gunmen. A police van circled the neighborhood, its loudspeakers blasting pleas for witnesses to come forward.</p>
        <p>A police helicopter hovered over the scene and, for reasons they would not disclose, officers searched for a green 1994 Nissan Maxima.</p>
        <p>Several factors hampered investigators yesterday. A security camera surveyed the front counter area of the store, but the videotape from the camera was missing.</p>
        <p>''If we were making an educated guess at this point, it would appear the tape was taken,'' an official said.</p>
        <p>And the sound of gunfire may have been muffled by work crews who were jackhammering a sidewalk just four doors down.</p>
        <p>''I heard nothing because of the construction,'' said Muhammed Khalid, manager of the Flushing News Outlet, a store four doors down from the Wendy's.</p>
        <p>Even so, officials said they had more than enough leads to pursue, and they expressed confidence that they would soon make arrests.</p>
        <p>''It may be today, it may be tomorrow, it may be later,'' one senior law enforcement official said, ''but we will get these guys. If we can't catch guys like this, then shame on us.''</p>
