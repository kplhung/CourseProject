        <p>In a race that threatens to redefine the outer limits of what it costs to run for the United States Senate, Jon S. Corzine has already spent nearly $25 million on his race for the Democratic nomination, more than three times as much as anyone has ever spent on a Senate primary and within striking distance of the most money ever spent on an entire Senate election.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey primary for the seat being vacated by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg is not until June 6. But as of May 17, Mr. Corzine had spent $24.9 million on his contest with former Gov. Jim Florio, according to documents filed today with the Federal Election Commission.</p>

        <p>In a race that threatens to redefine the outer limits of what it costs to run for the United States Senate, Jon S. Corzine has already spent nearly $25 million on his race for the Democratic nomination, more than three times as much as anyone has ever spent on a Senate primary and within striking distance of the most money ever spent on an entire Senate election.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey primary for the seat being vacated by Senator Frank R. Lautenberg is not until June 6. But as of May 17, Mr. Corzine had spent $24.9 million on his contest with former Gov. Jim Florio, according to documents filed today with the Federal Election Commission.</p>
        <p>The previous spending record in a Senate primary is believed to be the $8.1 million, spent by Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York in his 1998 race. The record for spending in an entire Senate race is now held by Michael Huffington, the California millionaire who lost to Dianne Feinstein in 1994 after pouring nearly $30 million into his campaign, $28 million of which came from his own fortune. The record for any statewide primary is the $38 million spent by Al Checchi, a California airline executive, in an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 1998. Because of its size and array of major media markets, California is regarded as by far the most expensive state to mount a political campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine is likely to exceed Mr. Huffington's record even before Primary Day. Since May 17, for example, Mr. Corzine has boosted his purchases of television commercials in New York and Philadelphia by 50 percent, to $2 million a week, which is itself said to be a new high for New Jersey political campaigns. And in the last week of the primary campaign, Mr. Corzine is expected to spend close to another $2 million on get-out-the-vote efforts, such as hiring street workers to knock on doors.</p>
        <p>''We're in uncharted territory, here, and I don't think anybody knows how high it'll go except possibly Mr. Corzine himself,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington. ''My sense is there's a whole generation of sons and daughters of political consultants who'll be going to the best Ivy League schools by the time this campaign is over.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's primary opponent, Mr. Florio, has accused his rival of trying to ''buy the election,'' and today, several advocates of campaign finance reform took up that refrain.</p>
        <p>''Every time you have a race with this kind of huge money, it takes you one step closer to a system dominated by very wealthy people, or people who are completely indebted to their campaign donors,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington public policy group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine defends his campaign expenditures as necessary for a political newcomer running against a household name like Mr. Florio's. And many experts say New Jersey can be a particularly costly place to run for statewide office, because the state has no widely watched television station of its own, forcing candidates to advertise on TV stations in New York and Philadelphia -- the nation's first and fourth most expensive media markets, respectively.</p>
        <p>''It's the hardest place in the world to communicate, to pop through to the voters and get a message through, and Corzine's running against someone who's universally known,'' said Hank Morris, a consultant who has run campaigns in New York and New Jersey. ''There are only two ways to get through to the voters in New Jersey: to communicate over a very, very long time, which is what Florio's done, or to spend a very large amount of money.''</p>
        <p>Since last summer, when Mr. Corzine paid thousands for some consultants to polish his presentation skills and for others to help him develop his political platform, he has presided over the Rolls-Royce of campaigns. But in the six-and-a-half-week period covered in his most recent F.E.C. filing, his spending accelerated to its fastest rate yet, paying out a total of $14.6 million, or more than $300,000 a day.</p>
        <p>It bought $10.7 million worth of TV and radio commercials, and $946,595 of newspaper ads. It spent $337,607 on postage for direct mailings. It paid its consultants $446,972, its canvassers $133,590 and its pollsters $639,600 -- at a time when those pollsters still had not begun conducting nightly tracking surveys.</p>
        <p>By comparison, Mr. Florio's shoestring campaign spent all of $1.1 million over the same period, $900,000 of that to purchase TV advertisements that began running only on Wednesday, 10 weeks after Mr. Corzine's television campaign had started. All told, since last year, Mr. Florio has spent $1.9 million running for the Democratic nomination -- meaning that he has now been outspent by more than 13 to 1.</p>
        <p>''One would want some kind of financial balance in our campaign process,'' said Mr. Wertheimer, of Democracy 21. ''And whatever the appropriate balance might be, this huge sum far exceeds it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio continued today to describe Mr. Corzine's spending as ''obscene.''</p>
        <p>''However this thing turns out, he's going to be the poster boy for campaign finance reform,'' said Mr. Florio, likening his rival to ''the oligarchs in Russia who are buying places in power, buying the government.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's co-campaign manager, Steven Goldstein, responded equally harshly. ''Jon Corzine has spent one dollar for every lie Jim Florio has told in this campaign,'' he said, adding that Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion 1990 tax increase as governor remained of greater importance to New Jersey voters than campaign finance. ''Voters will care far more about the billions of dollars Jim Florio has taken out of their pockets than the millions Jon Corzine has taken out of his.''</p>
