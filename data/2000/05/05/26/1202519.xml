        <p>Since 1954, when he did his first realist painting, one of his pregnant wife, Paul Georges has stayed with traditional subject matter: self-portraits, nudes, landscapes, flowers, mythological and occasional religious scenes.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Georges, a student of the progressive teacher and painter Hans Hofmann, uses the methods of modernist art: shallow space with ambiguous perspective, subordination of details to dominant forms, the flat planes and color areas of contemporary abstraction.</p>

        <p>'The Big Idea:</p>
        <p>A Retrospective'</p>
        <p>Center for Figurative Painting</p>
        <p>115 West 30th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>Through June 10</p>
        <p>Since 1954, when he did his first realist painting, one of his pregnant wife, Paul Georges has stayed with traditional subject matter: self-portraits, nudes, landscapes, flowers, mythological and occasional religious scenes.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Georges, a student of the progressive teacher and painter Hans Hofmann, uses the methods of modernist art: shallow space with ambiguous perspective, subordination of details to dominant forms, the flat planes and color areas of contemporary abstraction.</p>
        <p>This mini-retrospective of nearly 20 paintings in diverse styles inaugurates a new, ''academically oriented'' exhibition space established by an anonymous patron to display his own collection. The Georges works include a number of ambitious self-portraits. A comparison of two of them, separated by more than 40 years, reveals how he has brightened and lightened his palette and compositions.</p>
        <p>The earlier portrait, dated 1956, shows Mr. Georges; his wife, Lisette; and their young daughter in the studio as he prepares to paint his wife in the nude. Stiff and off-putting, in dark old masterish tones, it seems to celebrate the artist's domination as paterfamilias by means of his brush.</p>
        <p>The more recent canvas, dated 1989-90, is far more inviting. The artist, wearing a bright blue outfit, stands alone, paintbrush in hand, near a screen door that reveals a wide expanse of yellow-green lawn bisected by a horizontal band across the door.</p>
        <p>The planes of bright blue and orange canvas can be seen on rich gray walls; a sketchy, rather Cubist-looking dog reclines on the floor. The painting's welcoming informality, its dazzlement of light and color, give the impression of an artist whose affection for the old masters has been happily tempered by the here and now.</p>
        <p>Also on view are several flower paintings, at which he is a master. His colorful blooms, in gardens or in vases, have a lusty freshness few contemporary painters can match.</p>
