        <p>At P.S. 1 in Long Island City, Queens, ''Greater New York'' is gradually being disassembled. (Sections of the show are on view through the summer.) But its youthful spirit lives on in Lower Manhattan in a small exhibition at the Clocktower, the imposing office building whose two top floors are home to P.S. 1's satellite gallery and its national and international studio programs.</p>
        <p>''Clocktower 2000'' is a showcase of the 18 artists from 14 countries who have worked on the premises over the last year. It packs a lot of diverse material into a not-huge space. But the curator, Roxana Marcoci, from the department of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, has performed organizational miracles, and the results look great.</p>
        <p>Certain threads that ran through the art in ''Greater New York'' also surface here: self-invented systems; hybrid media (often discreetly computer-assisted); unshowy formal polish; and a preference for understated ideas with resonant implications. Also consistent is the show's transnational mix, confirming yet again that New York is an important cultural node on a global circulatory system.</p>
        <p>The city is a central image in some of the work. The Japanese artist Hironori Murai has produced an installation of black vinyl puppets sporadically stirring to life against a projected film of a New York subway ride. The figures, which resemble the voiceless backup performers in Kabuki, suggest the shadow life of an urban underworld.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Sara Chi Hang Wong and Leung Chi Wo from Hong Kong train their sights upward. They filmed the rooflines and sky in nearby Chinatown, then cut out sections of sky from the film and used the shapes to make cookies. These were served at the show's opening in a kind of hospitality-as-art gesture that has enjoyed a convivial run in recent years.</p>
        <p>Nurturing also underlies a project by Elke Lehmann, a German-born artist living in the United States, who fed sea gulls at her studio window throughout her residency. A film of birds eating now plays in her otherwise empty studio, while live microphones pick up ambient outdoor sounds, including the cry of gulls wheeling around the Clocktower. (Ms. Lehmann also has an installation at Stephen Gang Gallery in Chelsea this month.)</p>
        <p>The Clocktower is the focus of a text-and-photo project by the Dutch conceptualists Liesbeth Bik and Jos van der Pol, who also plan to transfer floodlights from the roof of P.S. 1 to the top of the Clocktower. The lights haven't arrived yet, but one suspects they will. A few years ago these artist-movers built a full-scale copy of part of the Institute of Contemporary Art bookstore in London and shipped it to a New York gallery.</p>
        <p>The idea of travel, with its epiphanies and perils, is the theme of two very different pieces in the show. In the case of a fine-tuned wall drawing by David Godbold of Dublin, it takes a historical cast. He turns a 16th-century engraving of New World exploration into a scathingly satirical comic strip, featuring a clueless Columbus and cheeky mermaids.</p>
        <p>The other work is a video by the American artist Andrea Ray, which records a trip she made to China. The film alternates straightforward tourist scenes and jerky, distracted hand-held-camera shots, and it is accompanied by a trancelike recorded monologue that dwells on an unnamed illness picked up en route. (''It must have been the fruit,'' Ms. Ray intones as if exhausted at one point.)</p>
        <p>''Clocktower 2000'' includes a smattering of photography, notably shots of fancy at-home art collections, which tend to look like high-priced clutter, by Montserrat Soto of Spain. Painting and sculpture are represented by the work of the Belgian artist Gert Verhoeven, as is the show's quotient of hands-on material funk. (Mr. Verhoeven also has a solo exhibition of paintings at Christine Burgin Gallery in Chelsea.)</p>
        <p>Film, in various forms, is the dominant medium. Claudia and Julia Muller, grave-faced sisters from Switzerland, perform a series of ordinary on-camera acts that end up looking like mechanized, slightly sinister rituals. The Korean artist Seung-Young Kim films the letter I being traced in sand, then erased by wind. Susan MacWilliam from Belfast, Northern Ireland, turns the image of a woman repeatedly fainting into an operatic scene with pathological overtones.</p>
        <p>Jan Kopp, a German in France, provides new voice-overs for dozens of clips from American television -- cartoons, sitcoms, political speeches -- captured during weeks of intensive channel-surfing. (Check out his revised version of a televised Clinton speech about the fall of the Berlin Wall.)</p>
        <p>The most arresting entry, though, is a wrap-around sound and video piece by the Austrian team of Kurt Hentschlager and Ulf Langheinrich, who call themselves Granular Synthesis. Its rumbling computer-generated audio track recalls the extraordinary sound installation by Stephen Vitiello in ''Greater New York'' but with a pulsating video component added.</p>
        <p>The seismic Granular Synthesis sound (which will also be heard in an Art in the Anchorage installation this summer) even filters up to the one-room gallery set in the clocktower itself. The space, with its high ceiling and soft light, is fabulous, and thanks to Ms. Marcoci's discerning eye, it's a visual cap to the show.</p>
        <p>Ms. MacWilliam's ''Faint'' is here. So is work by the American artist Elizabeth Zawada, large-format photographs of rows of random handwritten numbers punctuated by painted flowers. The sense of boundless and fruitless proliferation conveyed here is echoed in a beautiful wall piece by Paola Pivi, who brings to mind subatomic particles with a dense cascade of hundreds of thousands of clear plastic pearls.</p>
        <p>Functional logic seems to be suspended on the domestic level in a sleeping platform designed by the German artist Sabine Hornig: a shelflike structure, it is installed high above reach and has no means of access. But all this strangeness achieves a cosmic resolution in ''Mandala of the B-Bodhisattva,'' by the American artist Sanford Biggers.</p>
        <p>A floor piece made from colored institutional linoleum tiles, the work has the abstract, symmetrical design of a meditational image but was created as a floor for break-dancing. The artist is African-American and has lived in Japan. From both cultures he takes arduous disciplines -- dance, meditation -- that lead to transcendent experience, and he conflates them and tosses an affectionate tribute to Carl Andre into the mix.</p>
        <p>Mr. Biggers, who does interesting work in several media, including sculpture and video, is also one of this year's artists in residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem and will have work on view there starting June 21.</p>
        <p>One other entrant in ''Clocktower 2000'' should also be mentioned: the American conceptualist and performance artist Fiona Templeton. During her residency, Ms. Templeton has been working on a live, language-intensive solo piece meant to last 24 hours. At this point she is performing it in increments, with the next section scheduled for June 3 from noon to 6 p.m. Given the collective strength of the Clocktower show, she will be appearing in promising company.</p>
        <p>''Clockwork 2000: P.S. 1 National and International Studio Program 1999-2000'' is at the Clocktower Gallery, 108 Leonard Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 233-1096, through June 17. In Chelsea through tomorrow, Gert Verhoeven's paintings are at the Christine Burgin Gallery, 243 West 18th Street, (212) 462-2668, and Elke Lehmann's work is at the Stephen Gang Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 741-7832.</p>
