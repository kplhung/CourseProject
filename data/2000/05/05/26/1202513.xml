        <p>The Justice Department approved AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of the MediaOne Group today, giving the telephone giant control over more than a third of the nation's cable network for television, high-speed Internet access and online telephone service.</p>
        <p>The decision, which requires the companies to sell their interest in Road Runner, the nation's second-largest cable Internet service, clears a significant regulatory hurdle. The companies now await a decision, expected soon, by the Federal Communications Commission. The staff of the commission has raised concerns about the companies having too much control over both cable systems and programming. Federal regulations prohibit a company from owning more than 30 percent of the nation's cable systems and by some estimates, AT&amp;T would control more than 40 percent once it completed its purchase of MediaOne.</p>
        <p>Competitors and consumer groups have also asked the F.C.C. to force the sale of more assets to ensure a competitive marketplace for cable television, high-speed Internet access and online telephone service.</p>
        <p>The decision by the Justice Department continues the Clinton administration's policy of putting relatively few obstacles in the way of the consolidation of the telecommunications market after it was deregulated in 1996. The administration has not blocked any major deal, although it has begun to indicate that consolidation may have reached its limits.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the staff of the Justice Department's antitrust division recommended that it block the proposed merger of WorldCom and Sprint. Federal regulators are also considering the proposed acquisition of Time Warner by America Online.</p>
        <p>The proposed merger of AT&amp;T and MediaOne was valued at $58 billion when it was announced a year ago during the wave of consolidation in the telecommunications and high-speed Internet markets. Those deals have posed a particular challenge for antitrust regulators because of the complex interlocking ownership interests among cable operators, programmers and high-speed Internet service providers.</p>
        <p>Both AT&amp;T, which will be the nation's largest cable operator when it completes the purchase of MediaOne, and Time Warner, which will be the second largest, have interests in high-speed Internet and programming companies, although the overlap will diminish somewhat with the sale of Road Runner.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T, for instance, has a controlling interest in Excite@Home, the largest cable modem service, and MediaOne now has a substantial interest in Road Runner, the second-largest service, which will most likely be sold. Time Warner also has a large interest in Road Runner. Moreover, MediaOne and Time Warner have large interests in Time Warner Entertainment, a programming and cable operating company.</p>
        <p>As its market share in the long-distance telephone business has begun to erode, AT&amp;T has embarked on a whirlwind of acquisitions to transform itself into a company that will be able to offer consumers a basket of services: television; the Internet; and local, long-distance and wireless telephone access.</p>
        <p>In the process, it has alarmed consumer groups and competitors who are concerned that the company is turning into an Internet version of the powerhouse monopoly that it was before the government broke it up 16 years ago. The critics have urged federal officials to force AT&amp;T to sell its interest in programming operations and cable modem services.</p>
        <p>While Justice Department officials agreed with the arguments over MediaOne's interest in Road Runner, they did not find antitrust problems with other aspects of the deal.</p>
        <p>''The merger as proposed would have had an anticompetitive impact on the emerging broadband market,'' said Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division. ''The divestiture assures that AT&amp;T will not acquire undue leverage in its dealings with broadband content providers, and American consumers will be the ultimate beneficiaries.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T executives hailed the decision, which they said they had anticipated from the moment the deal was announced.</p>
        <p>''The Road Runner divestiture is an obligation we always assumed we would face, and the decree proposes both a schedule and process that are fair and feasible,'' said James W. Cicconi, AT&amp;T's general counsel. ''We expect to gain F.C.C. approval of the merger shortly. After that, our intention is to close the merger as quickly as we can. Customers are clamoring for broadband, digital cable television and choice in local phone service. Our acquisition of MediaOne will greatly increase our ability to deliver all of those highly sought consumer services.''</p>
        <p>But consumer groups said the decision fell short of assuring competition in the emerging market and urged the F.C.C. to force the companies to sell more assets.</p>
        <p>''It's an important first step, but we're disappointed that AT&amp;T was not also required to shed the cable systems and programming they jointly own with the second-largest cable company, Time Warner,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of Consumers Union. ''This begins to disentangle the web of ownership between the two largest cable companies. The F.C.C. should now use its rules to split apart the programming networks and cable systems that the two companies jointly own.''</p>
        <p>While the Justice Department decision clears a major obstacle for AT&amp;T and MediaOne, officials at the Federal Communications Commission were still reviewing the deal and may require further divestitures.</p>
        <p>Last month, the staff of the commission recommended that, because AT&amp;T had such a large market share of cable systems, the company should relinquish either some control over those systems or some of their interests in programming. Staff officials suggested that could be accomplished by measures like shedding its programming units, Liberty Media and Rainbow Media Sports Holdings Inc., or MediaOne's interest in Time Warner Entertainment.</p>
        <p>The commission, which is expected to issue its decision soon, may adopt those recommendations, reject them or pursue another course. But its hand in negotiating with AT&amp;T was significantly strengthened last Friday when a federal appeals court, reversing a lower court decision, upheld the constitutionality of the regulations that limit how much of the cable industry one company may control.</p>
