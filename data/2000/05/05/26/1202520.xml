        <p>'Paintings of the 1950's'</p>
        <p>Achim Moeller Fine Art</p>

        <p>Through Wednesday</p>
        <p>This is the first of five shows planned by the gallery to celebrate the work of Piero Dorazio, whose painting and writing were important to the development of postwar Italian art.</p>
        <p>This show, organized by the art historian Francis M. Naumann, reveals Mr. Dorazio's rapid progression from early canvases with broken fields of color to the dense, liquescent, near-monochromatic paintings for which he was hailed in the late 1950's.</p>
        <p>A frequent visitor to the United States during that decade, he immersed himself in the abstract modes then prevalent and made paintings driven primarily by color and light.</p>
        <p>The small ''Nothing in Brooklyn'' (1954) is a decorous canvas whose tapestrylike brushwork is framed by strong colored borders; another work from that year, ''Garden of Pogo,'' inspired by the comic-strip figure, has a bright, neatly ordered pattern in yellow, white, black and red that dispenses with the borders.</p>
        <p>Later works of that decade, with bigger overall abstract elements, reflect the influence of Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner and other figures of the New York School. But by 1958 Mr. Dorazio was inventing his own compositions, intense, nuanced surfaces flecked with lighter colors, which suggest deep bodies of water.</p>
        <p>One of the most beautiful is ''Dies Irae'' (1958), a wavy field of deep blues inflected by raised curving lines and patches of pinkish red; another is the deep-gray ''Basalt'' from that year, a near-monochrome barely touched with pinkish red.</p>
        <p>Tune in next season for Dorazio in the 1960's.</p>
