        <p>When Representative Tom DeLay came to work on Wednesday, he was still a vote or two shy of the bare-minimum 150 Republicans he needed to help push the China trade bill over the top.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay, the Republican whip, had lined up lots of help. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was recruited to cajole several wavering Republicans. So was Gen. Colin L. Powell. Dozens of pro-trade lobbyists and corporate chieftains fanned out on Capitol Hill to buttonhole the last dozen or so undeclared members for what both camps predicted would be a nail-biter.</p>
        <p>Over the next crucial hours, those calls and an array of other influences paid off, as virtually every undeclared Republican, and even a few others who had been written off, broke Mr. DeLay's way. In all, 164 Republicans joined 73 Democrats voted to grant China permanent normal trading status, wiping out economic restrictions rooted in cold-war policy for a quarter century.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, they surprised me a little bit,'' said Mr. DeLay, whose bare-knuckle approach to head-counting has earned him the nickname the Hammer. ''Members in the last few hours really turned around and understood how important this was,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The bill now goes to the Senate, where critics are already preparing amendments that could upset the delicately crafted measure.</p>
        <p>Normalizing trade with China was a victory for the Clinton administration, but House Republicans had their own reasons for voting three-to-one in favor of the bill. Passage insured that Republicans' corporate benefactors would fully benefit from a market-opening accord Washington and Beijing negotiated that slashes Chinese tariffs on a wide range of farm and industrial products and removes some barriers to American service providers, like banks and telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>The House Republican leadership closed ranks behind the bill, arguing passionately that economic engagement would foster political change. But they needed to produce two-thirds of the yes votes, and had a tough sell with many Republicans who balked at rewarding a trade plum to a Communist government with a record of religious persecution and political repression.</p>
        <p>''There was nothing simple about this,'' said Bob Schaffer of Colorado, one of the last conservative House Republicans to climb down off the fence in favor.  ''The 51 percent of this bill that's good only barely outweighs the 49 percent that is truly deplorable.''</p>
        <p>Republican leaders said a number of factors helped sway undeclared members in the final  days and hours to provide the unexpectedly large margin of victory. An amendment creating a commission to monitor human rights in China won half a dozen Republicans and many more Democrats.</p>
        <p>Republicans lined up Chinese dissidents who said that the bill would improve the rights of religious minorities, arguing that persecution cannot survive the advent of the Internet. Representative David Dreier of California, a chief Republican supporter, enlisted the evangelist Billy Graham to endorse the measure.</p>
        <p>Two dozen Republicans with national security concerns were steered to General Powell or Representative Porter Goss, a Florida Republican who heads the House Intelligence Committee. ''I told them, the more open a society the better opportunity we have of getting results,'' said Mr. Goss.</p>
        <p>Many members cited increased trade and national security benefits as reasons to vote yes. These broader merits, combined with the home-district considerations, collectively sealed the decisions of many borderline supporters.</p>
        <p>''The key factor for me was that this was the last best hope to save family farms in middle and eastern Tennessee,'' said Representative Van Hilleary of Tennessee, who said Europe's agreement with China last week on Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization also  convinced him that American jobs were at stake.</p>
        <p>Finally, a few members who were leaning toward voting yes needed a touch of outside help to reach their decision. Governor Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, spoke to a handful of Republicans, including Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky, who was impressed by Mr. Bush's commitment to improving human rights in China.</p>
        <p>Christopher Cox, a California Republican and outspoken critic of China, endorsed the measure after provisions in the human rights commission were strengthened. Elton Gallegly, a California Republican, said backing the bill was easier after he spoke to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman about keeping a ban an Argentine oranges, which could introduce a citrus-killing insect into southern California orchards.</p>
        <p>Representative Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican with steel mills in his district, voted in favor after Republican leaders agreed to amend a spending bill to address his concerns about imported coke, which is used in steel-processing. ''We're always sensitive to our members needs,'' said Susan B. Hirschmann, Mr. DeLay's chief of staff.</p>
        <p>By the roll call, all but a handful of the 15 or so Republicans who started the day on the leaders' lists as undecided voted yes.</p>
        <p>''I've been counting votes for a long, long time and never in my life have I seen that many undecideds break in favor of a position,'' said Nick Calio, a bill supporter who was President Bush's top lobbyist on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>Labor leaders said they had been outgunned. ''The business community unleashed an unprecedented campaign that was hard for anyone to match,'' said George Becker, president of the United Steel Workers of America.</p>
        <p>The China bill's 40-vote margin of victory in the House, 237 to 197, would seem to give it unstoppable momentum as the legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration, probably next month. Passage in the Senate, which is usually considered more pro-trade and internationalist, had appeared more certain.</p>
        <p>But lurking in the Senate are critics like Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Helms, a fierce foe of the Beijing government, said after the House vote that he would not allow the Senate ''to simply rubber-stamp the President's plan to reward the Chinese Communists.''</p>
        <p>Opponents do not have the votes in the Senate to kill the House bill, but amending it -- open to any Senator -- would force House and Senate negotiators to hammer out a compromise of the competing chambers' bills.  The House would then have to cast a second vote on the revised bill.</p>
        <p>Supporters vowed today to push for speedy Senate passage of a clean House bill.</p>
        <p>''There will be efforts to derail this by using amendments and other parliamentary means,'' said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican who supports the measure. ''But we have to keep this moving.''</p>
        <p>Rushing to the next legislative battleground, Commerce Secretary William Daley, Mr. Clinton's point man on the China bill, marched to the Capitol today to meet with the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and senior members of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott gave no hint of when the Senate will take up the measure, Mr. Daley said in an interview, and when asked how serious Mr. Helms's veiled threats were, the secretary said, ''It's hard to judge how serious anything Chairman Helms does.''</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he and panel's chairman, William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, had no problems with the House bill. ''Our job now is to see that the bill stays right on the floor and is passed as it was sent to us,'' said Mr. Moynihan.</p>
