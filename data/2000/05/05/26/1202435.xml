        <p>Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen reprimanded his spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, and another senior Pentagon official today for releasing information to a journalist in 1998 from the private personnel file of Linda R. Tripp.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen's action came after a two-year investigation by the inspector general of the Defense Department concluded earlier this month that Mr. Bacon and his former assistant, Clifford H. Bernath, had violated the federal Privacy Act by disclosing confidential material from Mrs. Tripp's Pentagon employment file.</p>
        <p>Earlier, the Justice Department found no reason to bring criminal charges against the two officials.</p>
        <p>In his reprimand today, Mr. Cohen expressed disappointment in Mr. Bacon but said there was no evidence that his spokesman had intended to harm Mrs. Tripp in answering a reporter's inquiry two years ago.</p>
        <p>Responding to an inquiry from The New Yorker magazine, Mr. Bacon and Mr. Bernath told a reporter that Mrs. Tripp had incorrectly stated on a security clearance form that she had never been arrested. Jane Mayer, the writer who was working on a profile of Mrs. Tripp for The New Yorker, had asked the officials whether the Pentagon employee had disclosed a long-ago arrest.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tripp's tape recordings of telephone conversations she had with Monica S. Lewinsky led Kenneth W. Starr, who was then the Whitewater independent counsel, to begin investigating President Clinton. That investigation led to Mr. Clinton's impeachment in the most serious presidential scandal since Watergate.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mayer asked the Pentagon spokesman whether Mrs. Tripp had admitted on her security clearance form that she was arrested in 1969 on a charge of grand larceny that was later dismissed. On Mr. Bacon's instructions, Mr. Bernath searched the file and discovered that Mrs. Tripp had not mentioned the arrest.</p>
        <p>The Privacy Act prohibits the government from disclosing employee records in most instances without the consent of the employee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bacon said today that while he respected Mr. Cohen's decision, he believed that his conduct had been lawful under the federal Freedom of Information Act, which makes such information available to the public.</p>
        <p>''It certainly never occurred to me that the Privacy Act would preclude disclosing how a public figure recorded a public arrest record on a security clearance,'' Mr. Bacon said.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, the chief state prosecutor of Maryland dropped criminal wiretap charges against Mrs. Tripp, concluding the only criminal case against a major figure in the scandal.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tripp has filed a lawsuit against the White House, the Department of Defense and Mr. Bacon, asserting that they had conspired to intimidate her and that they had violated her rights under the Privacy Act.</p>
        <p>''When Mr. Bacon released that information, it had a devastating impact on Linda Tripp's credibility during a crucial phase of the Lewinsky investigation,'' Stephen M. Kohn, a lawyer for Mrs. Tripp, said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohn said he would ask the president to overturn what he called a mild rebuke, since the reprimand will not be included in Mr. Bacon's personnel file. He said he would ask the president to take immediate disciplinary action, which could include firing Mr. Bacon.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mr. Bacon noted that the two-year investigation, which included 95 interviews, had found that there was no evidence of White House involvement in his handling of The New Yorker request, and that his only motive was ''a desire to be responsive to an urgent media inquiry.''</p>
        <p>''This matter is an extremely small part of a large and painful national drama, which is why it has been studied by the Office of Independent Counsel and the Justice Department, both of which decided no further action was appropriate,'' Mr. Bacon said.</p>
