        <p>Offering an olive branch to Lebanon a day after withdrawing Israeli troops from its soil, Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel traveled to this northern border town today and appealed to the Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, to begin peace talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak addressed the Israeli Parliament at its first plenary session held outside Jerusalem, convened here in support of communities on Israel's northern frontier.</p>
        <p>Residents of this working-class town, hardened by years of crossborder rocket attacks by guerrillas in Lebanon, expressed skepticism that the withdrawal would bring lasting calm. One demonstrator greeted the prime minister with a sign: ''Barak is gambling with our lives.''</p>
        <p>Addressing the legislators in a local auditorium, Mr. Barak made his peace overture.</p>
        <p>''From this podium at Qiryat Shemona, the city that was the main target of aggression and terror from Lebanon, I appeal to the government and people of Lebanon: We have left all your country's territory up to the international border that is recognized by the United Nations,'' Mr. Barak said.</p>
        <p>''We don't covet a single inch of your land, we have no demands of you, except to strictly preserve security along our common border.''</p>
        <p>''I call on you, President Emile Lahoud: Israel extends its hand in peace, with the vision of a common future that will be better for the children of both peoples. Let us talk peace. Israel is not an enemy of Lebanon.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak said that Israeli troops had entered Lebanon only because it had become ''a hothouse for terror organizations and a base for aggression against us.''</p>
        <p>''Now we have an opportunity to turn over a new leaf,'' Mr. Barak said. ''This depends on us, on you and on the Syrian government.''</p>
        <p>Syria, which is the dominant power in Lebanon, is thought to be highly unlikely to sanction peace talks between Lebanon and Israel as long as its own negotiations with Israel to recover the Golan Heights remain suspended.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Barak tried to turn the withdrawal to diplomatic advantage, he received a cool reception from residents here, who are worried that guerrillas might now attack them from across the border fence, even though not a shot has been fired since the pullout.</p>
        <p>Visiting a falafel stand for a chat on the street, Mr. Barak was asked by a woman whether he thought his ''gamble would pay off.''</p>
        <p>Yossi Gavrieli, from the neighboring community of Margaliot, said that he expected crossborder shooting at Israeli Army patrols. Yitzhak Ohana predicted that Syria would sponsor guerrilla violence to press Israel into returning the Golan Heights. He held up a sign that said, ''We welcome the boys home, but what about my children?''</p>
        <p>Tamir Raymond shouted at Mr. Barak: ''Come live here.'' He complained that the prime minister visited Qiryat Shemona only when it was politically convenient.</p>
        <p>Up the road at Metulla, a community separated by a fence from a Lebanese village, Kafr Kila, youths on Lebanon's side raised the yellow flag of Hezbollah on the fence. ''You will all die,'' a youth shouted toward people on Israel's side.</p>
        <p>Smoke rose from an abandoned Israeli base that had been sacked by villagers. Youths climbed the border fence, taunting Israeli soldiers and pelting them with old shoes. ''God is great,'' they shouted. ''Death to Israel.''</p>
