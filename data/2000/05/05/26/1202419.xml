      <abstract>
        <p>Letter from William Crain says City University of New York's new master plan (May 23 article) may enhance its reputation, but it will restrict opportunities for financially disadvantaged students and students of color, who typically ï¿½receive poorest preparation for college</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The City University of New York's new master plan calls for elite senior colleges and higher admissions standards throughout the university (news article, May 23).</p>
        <p>The new policies may enhance CUNY's reputation in some circles, but they will restrict opportunities. Financially disadvantaged students and students of color, who typically receive the poorest preparation for college, will disproportionately find themselves in the ''second-tier'' colleges, if they can get into a college at all.</p>

        <p>The City University of New York's new master plan calls for elite senior colleges and higher admissions standards throughout the university (news article, May 23).</p>
        <p>The new policies may enhance CUNY's reputation in some circles, but they will restrict opportunities. Financially disadvantaged students and students of color, who typically receive the poorest preparation for college, will disproportionately find themselves in the ''second-tier'' colleges, if they can get into a college at all.</p>
        <p>Since 1970, when CUNY's open admissions policy took effect, CUNY has continued to provide a most rigorous education, as the percentages of graduates who go on to earn Ph.D.'s attest. CUNY has given thousands of students their first full opportunity to develop their minds and pursue their dreams. It would be a crime to take this away from them.</p>
        <p>WILLIAM  CRAIN  New York, May 24, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a professor of psychology at City College, CUNY.</p>
