        <p>Mike Freeman's On Pro Football column says Atlanta murder trial of Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis underscores current travails of National Football League; says legal spectacle is steadily tarnishing league's image, casting 'noxious fume' over all players and their deeds even though most contribute large amounts of time and money to charity (M)</p>

        <p>Ray Lewis is not accustomed to just sitting and watching while other people decide his fate. By his very nature he is a doer. He is a linebacker, probably the most destructive job title in sports. On the field his goal is to wreak havoc, and few players in recent years have done that better than Lewis.</p>
        <p>His success seems to have been destined. In his first game in his rookie season four years ago, he was named defensive player of the week after nine tackles and one interception. Players on both teams said they had not seen a rookie hit that hard in years.</p>

        <p>Ray Lewis is not accustomed to just sitting and watching while other people decide his fate. By his very nature he is a doer. He is a linebacker, probably the most destructive job title in sports. On the field his goal is to wreak havoc, and few players in recent years have done that better than Lewis.</p>
        <p>His success seems to have been destined. In his first game in his rookie season four years ago, he was named defensive player of the week after nine tackles and one interception. Players on both teams said they had not seen a rookie hit that hard in years.</p>
        <p>Now he is a team leader, the highest-paid linebacker in football. He is also on trial for murder. The doer, the on-field destroyer, sits in an Atlanta courtroom, in designer suits, his beard and mustache trimmed neatly, flanked not by his Baltimore Ravens teammates, but an army of defense lawyers, a Southern dream team whose goal is to free him of the charges.</p>
        <p>At this point Lewis is nothing more than a bystander. A somber Lewis is not playing before tens of thousands of fans, but is being judged by a handful of jury members. Lewis and his defense team are putting on the performance of a lifetime. They must if they are to save Lewis from spending the rest of his life in jail.</p>
        <p>One hundred years from now, when historians look back at this point in the National Football League, there will be discussions about the sport's popularity, its great television ratings, its outstanding athletes like Randy Moss and Drew Bledsoe. But the microscopes will particularly focus on this moment and how this was one of the most trying times for a great league.</p>
        <p>The image is indeed stunning. A current professional football player, in a court of law, charged with murder, the legal spectacle available for all to see live on cable television. As each day of the trial continues, the N.F.L.'s image takes another hit.</p>
        <p>It does not matter that most N.F.L. players are good citizens. It does not matter that most players contribute large amounts of time and money to charity. When an N.F.L. player is charged with murder, it casts a noxious fume over all the players and their deeds.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors maintain that a blood trail connects Lewis to two men who were viciously stabbed to death after a Super Bowl party last January. Defense lawyers portray the N.F.L. star as a peacemaker who did not kill or stab anyone.</p>
        <p>At one point in the trial -- as prosecutors showed the jurors knives that the state contends were used to murder two people -- Lewis intently took notes. As witnesses testified, Lewis made direct eye contact with each, and sometimes smiled at some jury members, as if he were trying to make a personal connection. In other moments, Lewis simply squeezed a tennis ball as he listened to the testimony. He wore a ''W.W.J.D.'' bracelet -- ''What Would Jesus Do?'' On the other side of the room, the families of the two victims, Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar, were often in tears.</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. is a constant topic among lawyers involved in the case, using the sport, twisting it to fit their theories. The defense says Lewis left the scene and lied to the police about not knowing the other two alleged assailants because of fear that his career would be ruined, not because he stabbed anyone. The prosecution maintains that Lewis's concern for his livelihood came only after the deaths. Usually it is the N.F.L. that maneuvers and manipulates -- as it does with the television networks at contract time -- to further its agenda. This time, professional football is the entity being used.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, hundreds of miles away, in Baltimore, owners from the league's 31 teams have been meeting this week, and among the topics was the sometimes disturbing off-field behavior of their players. The name of Ray Lewis rings in the ears of the owners like the dull pain of a hangover.</p>
        <p>Ownership, under the shadow of the Lewis trial, approved new measures to fortify what is already a strong anti-crime policy. The league-wide screening process of players will be expanded to include testing, interviewing and evaluating at the annual scouting combine. There will be a mandatory intervention process to support and counsel incoming at-risk players and professional counselors will help coaches identify the same.</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. is watching the trial, holding its collective breath. At stake for Lewis is his freedom. At stake for the N.F.L. is its image. People who think football is populated by brutes who are ticking bombs will use the Lewis trial, if he is found guilty, as ammunition. This is already beginning, and the chorus will only become louder as Rae Carruth, another N.F.L. player accused of murder, and Mark Chmura, the Green Bay tight end who was charged this month with sexually assaulting his teenage babysitter who had been drinking, wind their way through the court system.</p>
        <p>Actually, an N.F.C. East player who asked not to be identified said this week that he understands how Lewis might have become involved in the fracas, although he believes Lewis is innocent of stabbing the two men. On the field, teammates instinctively protect one another. So if a player sees a teammate punched, that player will go after the offender, as a way of backing up his friend. This player contends that Lewis's on-field instincts may have taken over when he saw his two friends get into a fight that dark night.</p>
        <p>Another player, also in the N.F.C. East, strongly disagreed, saying the vast majority of players can separate those instincts. They can flip a switch and the violence that occurs on the field does not cross over to their personal lives. After practice they are fathers hopping into the minivan and taking their kids to a soccer game.</p>
        <p>Before court every day, Lewis meets with his personal adviser and friend, the Rev. J. Richard Harris. While in court, Lewis is being supported by his mother and other family members as well as friends. Occasionally he turns to his supporters and smiles.</p>
        <p>That smile always evaporates into a look of contemplation. No one, of course, knows exactly what Lewis is thinking. Maybe he wishes this public spectacle would soon end. Maybe the N.F.L. is thinking the same thing.</p>
