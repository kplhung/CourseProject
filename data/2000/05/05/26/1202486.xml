        <p>Faced with a new warning by a prominent religious conservative against selecting a running mate who supports a right to abortion, Gov. George W. Bush today called himself ''a pretty independent thinker'' whose main criterion for a vice-presidential nominee was an ability to assume the presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush spoke of his vice-presidential search as he stood beside Colin L. Powell, the retired general and Republican dream candidate who refuses to seek elective office. General Powell, prompted by reporters' questions, repeated his wish to see the anti-abortion plank removed from the Republican platform. And he once again said he would not be interested in being Mr. Bush's running mate.</p>
        <p>''I am not a candidate for the vice presidency, and I'm not seeking it,'' he said. ''The governor knows that.'' But he left the door open to a cabinet post. ''In any other capacity,'' he said, ''one has to listen when the president asks you to consider a job.''</p>
        <p>The day's event had not been devised for talk of abortion politics. In the garden of the Governor's Mansion, Mr. Bush and General Powell  signed an agreement in which Texas and America's Promise, the general's volunteer group to help the nation's youth, vowed to work together.</p>
        <p>But the subsequent news conference quickly turned to the jousting inside the Republican Party over Mr. Bush's choice of a running mate, just a day after the religious conservative James C. Dobson told reporters that Mr. Bush ''sounds a whole lot more conservative when he is talking to conservatives and a whole lot more moderate when he is talking to moderates.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Dobson accused Mr. Bush of sacrificing the party's core principles and called on him to choose a running mate opposed to abortion.</p>
        <p>''The base in the Republican Party is pro-life,'' Dr. Dobson said. ''You can't have it all, and you can't win without that base.''</p>
        <p>Asked his response, Mr. Bush gave neither a nod to Dr. Dobson's concerns nor a hint where his running mate would stand on abortion. ''I appreciate advice,'' the governor said. ''I'm getting it from all corners. But I'm a pretty independent thinker.'' And, he said, his political message is always consistent. ''It's basically this: we're going to trust people, not government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Pressed several times on whether he was listening to either conservatives or abortion-rights Republicans about the choice of a vice-presidential nominee, Mr. Bush listed some of his criteria for selecting a running mate.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking for someone who could be president, someone able to fill that job,'' he said, a theme he emphasized twice.</p>
        <p>''I'm looking for someone who would be loyal,'' he added. ''I'm looking for someone who brings honesty and integrity to the office, someone whose judgment I could count upon.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush repeated his position that the Republican platform's plank against abortion should remain intact. General Powell, asked whether he agreed, said: ''I would work to remove it. But good friends can disagree on issues, so I don't see that there is a big fight over that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, who has been positioning himself close to the political center, faces a major decision on whether he can afford to select a running mate, like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who backs abortion rights.  In a New York Times/CBS News survey this month, 3 of every 10 Republican voters polled said they would be less likely to support Mr. Bush if he picked a running mate who backed a right to abortion.</p>
        <p>As reporters tried and failed several times to draw Mr. Bush out on how much he was weighing abortion in his choice of a running mate, he seemed to grow impatient.</p>
        <p>''I'm making an exhaustive search,'' he said. ''I've laid out the characteristics necessary for the vice presidency. And at some point in time you're going to find out who it is. And on that cheery note we will end.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush did say, in an interview with The Associated Press, that he was not considering either General Powell or Senator John McCain, taking them at their word that they did not want the job.</p>
