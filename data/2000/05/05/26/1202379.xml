        <p>I was still in grade school when I had my first ride in a Chris-Craft Racing Runabout. It was mid-August 1959, and Barnegat Bay in New Jersey was pure glass. Taking my cues from my father -- a sailor and ice-boater -- I had disdained ''stinkpots,'' the sailor's term for motorboats. But when a friend invited me for a spin on his father's gleaming wooden motorboat, I hopped in.</p>
        <p>A deft captain, my friend's father smoothly maneuvered us out of the slip, careful to make no wake. On the bay, he smiled as he opened the throttle full. We roared into the night, the acceleration jamming me back into the red vinyl cushions. The long sleek bow with its racy caulk lines lifted high out of the water; phosphorescent spray flamed by the low freeboard like galaxies of stars. I was thrilled: this must be what astronauts felt, shooting though space.</p>

        <p>I was still in grade school when I had my first ride in a Chris-Craft Racing Runabout. It was mid-August 1959, and Barnegat Bay in New Jersey was pure glass. Taking my cues from my father -- a sailor and ice-boater -- I had disdained ''stinkpots,'' the sailor's term for motorboats. But when a friend invited me for a spin on his father's gleaming wooden motorboat, I hopped in.</p>
        <p>A deft captain, my friend's father smoothly maneuvered us out of the slip, careful to make no wake. On the bay, he smiled as he opened the throttle full. We roared into the night, the acceleration jamming me back into the red vinyl cushions. The long sleek bow with its racy caulk lines lifted high out of the water; phosphorescent spray flamed by the low freeboard like galaxies of stars. I was thrilled: this must be what astronauts felt, shooting though space.</p>
        <p>It is just such early memories that have made the 19-foot Chris-Craft Racing Runabout one of the most popular classic boats in the United States, according to Wilson W. Wright, the executive director of the Chris-Craft Antique Boat Club, which is based in Tallahassee, Fla. From 1947 to July 1954, 503 were built. ''They were the Corvettes, the Thunderbirds of their era,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And like their automotive counterparts, they can fetch high prices, as much as $50,000 for a show-quality boat with original hardware and motor. Boats in excellent condition but lacking what judges term ''originality,'' because owners have added souped-up motors or improved controls, are also popular. One, a 1953 Chris-Craft Racing Runabout, is expected to fetch $25,000 to $35,000 at the New Hampshire Antique and Classic Boat Auction on June 17 at Moody Mountain Farm in Wolfeboro, N.H.</p>
        <p>''It was a basket case when I found it eight years ago,'' said Gil Steward, who donated the boat for the auction to benefit the New Hampshire Antique and Classic Boat Museum on Lake Winnipesaukee. Restorers rebuilt the bottom and deck for Mr. Steward, a stockbroker who also judges classic boat shows. He set to work rebuilding and installing a small block Chevrolet 350 Ci-250 horsepower engine with a Holley carburetor. ''I'm a hot rodder at heart,'' he said. ''I figure, conservatively, it will go 55 to 57 miles per hour.''</p>
        <p>Going fast is what these wooden boats are all about. In the late 19th century, Mr. Wright said, the first racing runabouts were custom-built for gentlemen boaters on the St. Lawrence Seaway. By the 1920's, several companies vied for the trade. Cigar-smoking Chris Smith, the founder of Chris-Craft, took a lesson from Detroit and built the first standardized runabout in 1922.</p>
        <p>''Henry Ford wanted to put a car in every garage in America,'' Mr. Wright said. ''Chris Smith wanted to put a boat in every boathouse.'' Unlike Gar Wood, which produced runabouts one at a time, with the same crew working on every detail of the boat, Smith broke down the assembly into teams. ''Think of the Model A,'' Mr. Wright said.</p>
        <p>After World War II Chris-Craft became the largest manufacturer of wooden motorboats. The 19-foot Racing Runabout was the speedster of the line, painted red-and-white or blue-and-white. Some claim that this was a patriotic gesture to attract returning G.I.'s, but most historians believe they were painted because of the materials used -- fir and cedar rather than the mahogany so prized for brightwork. In 1949, when wood from the Philippines was available again, the company built the boats in varnished Chris-Craft-grade mahogany (actually, a mahogany relative called luan).</p>
        <p>Races, sanctioned by the American Power Boat Association or informal, were held on summer weekends across the country, from Long Island Sound to Lake Tahoe. Jack Savage, author of ''Chris-Craft'' (MBI Publishing), said there was even a race down the Colorado River. The contest was between a 19-foot Chris-Craft Racing Runabout and a specially built racer -- an archetypal battle between the common man and privileged class. The assembly-line Chris-Craft won when the custom boat's water-cooled engine lost power because of the sandy river water.</p>
        <p>By the mid-1950's Chris-Craft stopped producing the jazzy Racing Runabout, shifting its emphasis to larger leisure crafts with open cockpits, more suited to America's growing families. A final blow came when fiberglass took over the industry. By the 1970's the wooden Racing Runabouts were considered passe.</p>
        <p>Smaller and easier to store, most racers did not meet the fate of many larger woodies, left to rot in some marsh or hauled to a garbage dump and burned. Instead, they were stored in boathouses, pulled out of the water on pulleys.</p>
        <p>Today, many of the antique Racing Runabouts can be found on or near northern lakes, precisely because of those boathouses (sun is hard on wood) and because in colder climes boats were seldom used more than 40 hours a summer. (Freshwater is not a factor: while easier than saltwater on engines and chrome, it is harder on wood because of dry rot.)</p>
        <p>Anyone can learn the age of a Chris-Craft boat by giving the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Va., its hull number, from a brass tag on the engine hatch. Chris-Craft kept meticulous records and in 1985 donated its archives -- 55,000 plans, 25,000 photographs and 105,000 hull cards -- to the museum.</p>
        <p>''There was one hull card for each boat built from 1922 to 1980, a little bit like a birth certificate,'' explained Jerry Conrad, archivist for the museum. The hull card details when the boat was built, the specifications, and to what town and dealer it was shipped. The museum receives 1,200 to 1,500 requests a year.</p>
        <p>Owners of the classic racing runabouts no longer race as a formal class -- Mr. Wright, a lawyer, ruefully talks of liability and insurance -- but they attend vintage boat shows. The big ones include the season opener in Mount Dora, Fla., in March; in Wiers on Lake Winnipesaukee on July 29; and in Clayton, N.Y, and Tahoe, Calif., in August.</p>
        <p>And if two or three Chris-Craft racers should meet on the water? Well, says Mr. Wright, maybe there will be an informal test of speed: ''It's a basic instinct.''</p>
        <p>George Johnson, who has been selling, riding and racing boats on the Eastern seaboard for over half a century, estimates there are probably 200 Chris-Craft Racing Runabouts in various conditions on the lakes, bays and rivers of the country. And two companies -- Vintage Marine in Mattituck, N.Y., and Golden Era Classics, outside Sydney, Australia -- build replicas of the Chris-Craft Racing Runabout, for those who don't want to go through the lengthy process of finding and restoring an original.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, 75 and living on Lake Winnipesaukee, has sold his two antique Racing Runabouts and ordered two reproductions for himself.</p>
        <p>''They're nicer, stronger, faster, lighter,'' he said, adding that what he really likes to do is take an evening spin, when the water is still and the breeze is down, and the deep reverberating sound of the motor echoes off the wooded hills.</p>
