        <p>Mesopotamia, whose name comes from the Greek for ''between the rivers,'' is one of the places where it all began, a cradle of Western civilization, like ancient Egypt. The rivers are the Tigris and the Euphrates, and the land between is a flood plain that today is in Iraq. It was inhospitable terrain: flat, arid and lacking in indigenous plant life or useful materials like stone, metals and wood.</p>
        <p>But in the seventh millennium B.C. it was settled by people whom historians call Sumerians. And by the late fourth millennium, the Sumerians began to meet the requirements for ranking as a cradle of civilization. They probably invented the wheel; they established one of the world's first irrigation systems, essential to both agriculture and flood control; and they created one of the first written languages. The keeping of written records made large urban centers possible -- most notably the city-states of Uruk and Ur -- as well as an elaborate economy that included trade with places as far away as Afghanistan (from which the Sumerians imported various kinds of stone).</p>
        <p>Beginning about 3500 B.C., the Sumerians also produced artworks of lasting beauty. Some of these, belonging to the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, form the core of ''Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur,'' a sumptuous exhibition at the Pierpont Morgan Library. They were allowed to travel for the first time while the museum in Philadelphia is being renovated.</p>
        <p>Everything in this show came to light between 1922 and 1934, when archaeologists sponsored by the university and the British Museum discovered and excavated a vast cemetery full of hundreds of intact, often lavishly equipped tombs at Ur, the southernmost of the ancient Sumerian city-states. Leading the team was C. Leonard Woolley (1880-1960), an English archaeologist known for his energy and meticulousness.</p>
        <p>Gertrude Bell, another archaeologist of the time, described Woolley as ''a tiresome little man but a first class digger.'' At the Morgan, photographs blown up to sepia-toned wall murals indicate the substantial size of one of the main pits at Ur and also the work force. But once the heavy work was done, Woolley usually sent everyone away and did the most delicate, time-consuming excavating himself, working face down in the dirt with a knife and a little brush beside his wife, Catherine, who was also an archaeologist, and one trusted assistant.</p>
        <p>In a letter quoted in the catalog, he describes the tedium of stringing beads from this vantage point, the better to preserve the order in which they were found.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has taken an introductory survey of Western art has seen images of the exhibition's stars. There is the Ram Caught inthe Thicket, a small sculpture of an avid ram made of gold, lapis lazuli and silver, whose wool is ingeniously depicted as rows of spearheadlike pieces of shell. He stands on his hind feet, as if to graze on a gold tree. There is also the Great Lyre, with its big prow-like bull's head bearded in lapis. Just below is the lyre's four-tiered inlaid front panel, rich in intimations of gods and myths to come.</p>
        <p>The panel's four scenes include one of the first appearances of what art historians call the nude bearded hero as well as figures and creatures that presage the Holy Trinity, the minotaur, and the clever beasts of Aesop. Also present is a scorpion-tailed man resembling a devil. All the standard textbooks of Western art reproduce two of these three items.</p>
        <p>It is, however, something else to see the real thing, and in the company of nearly 200 other objects from the tombs, sensitively lighted and displayed in nearly invisible vitrines. There have been significant reconservations: the ram's feet, for example. After an earlier conservation, they had hung oddly in the air in photographs published as recently as 1993; now they rest on the tree's gold boughs, as if on the handlebars of a bicycle.</p>
        <p>The show also has vessels of gold, silver and calcite, a pale translucent stone; tools and weapons; and, perhaps most interesting, the small stone cylinder seals that served important people as amulets and early identification cards. (These are supplemented by a selection of Middle Eastern cylinder seals from the library's own holdings, displayed in the East Room.) Most prevalent is all manner of jewelry: headdresses, rings, earrings, cloak pins, beaded necklaces and chokers, belts and even a beaded cape belonging to a queen or aristocrat named Puabi, whose grave accounts for more than half the exhibition.</p>
        <p>The assembled objects suggest that the Sumerian elite lived well and died even better. Not only were their bodies lavishly adorned and surrounded by objects both useful and entertaining (lyres, for example, and little lapis tablets that may be the first dominoes), but they were also accompanied by attendants, themselves richly adorned, along with oxen and carts. The burial was the culmination of a feast and processional march into the tomb, where the animals were slaughtered and the attendants either committed suicide or were ritually killed.</p>
        <p>The objects in this exhibition suggest their own purely visual criteria for qualifying as a cradle of civilization. While neither as unbending nor as pure as the Egyptians, the Sumerians achieved a consistency of style that operated over a range of media: sculpture, incised relief, inlay and the incised cylinder seals, whose cartoonlike narratives are made visible here with enlarged photographs and  modern clay impressions.</p>
        <p>Given the barbarism of human sacrifice, the style is surprisingly buoyant, characterized by a wide-eyed innocence and alertness that are also visible in Minoan and Etruscan figures. (The Sumerian animals are also depicted with wide round eyes: those of the bull on the Great Lyre, emphasized by repeating creases, make clear why targets are known as bull's-eyes.)</p>
        <p>The recurrence of certain motifs from one medium to another is a further consistency, one that indicates art's increasingly complex mirroring of life. The sketchy lines visible around the heads of the tiny figures on the cylinder seals are drinking tubes, like a long gold one, resembling a bit of miniaturized plumbing pipe, in one of the vitrines. The fringed garments worn by the figures are sheepskin, as verified by a front panel for a lyre where a figure wears a garment incised with the same spear shapes that appear in three-dimensions on the back of the ram.</p>
        <p>An oddly shaped pouring vessel appears in the hand of an upright lion in the front panel of the Great Lyre, and others like it are in a vitrine. These vessels seem to have developed from the bisected conch shells used for the same purpose, which are also in the show.</p>
        <p>Lions are a frequent subject, especially impressive in a simple cast silver lion's head with staring eyes of lapis and shell. Also intriguing is a small, bedraggled copper relief that shows two striding beasts facing in opposite directions, as they would nearly 2,000 years later in the stone reliefs of Assyrian art. That lions were both a symbol of power and a real threat is apparent again in the cylinder seals, where they are repeatedly shown attacking domestic animals.</p>
        <p>One of the less expected pleasures here is the plentiful jewelry. In addition to suggesting that beautification of the human form is among the most ancient impulses, it also reflects a continually evolving ingenuity and technology. In jewelry the Sumerians made extensive use of three materials, all imported: red carnelian, blue lapis lazuli and gold.</p>
        <p>This triumvirate -- a mineral version of the primary colors -- recurs in different ratios, combinations and motifs and in beads and other elements of varying shape and size. It is a leitmotif that grows surely and irresistibly into a major theme of the exhibition.</p>
        <p>''Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur'' remains at the Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0008, through Sept. 10. It will travel to the Oriental Institute Museum in Chicago in October and to the Detroit Institute of Arts in February.</p>
