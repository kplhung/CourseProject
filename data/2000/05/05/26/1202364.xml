        <p>This holiday weekend, you can visit some close relatives in the Bronx. You say you don't have any family in the Bronx? Actually, you do: they're just hairier than most of your cousins. They're the principal residents of the Congo Gorilla Forest at the Bronx Zoo, which will salute them, Africa and the whole primate family at ''Celebration Congo.''</p>
        <p>The Harambee Dance Company, an African troupe, will ''do a whole skit with stilt walking, dancers and drummers,'' said Linda Corcoran, a zoo spokeswoman. Storytellers will offer folk tales with animal themes.</p>

        <p>This holiday weekend, you can visit some close relatives in the Bronx. You say you don't have any family in the Bronx? Actually, you do: they're just hairier than most of your cousins. They're the principal residents of the Congo Gorilla Forest at the Bronx Zoo, which will salute them, Africa and the whole primate family at ''Celebration Congo.''</p>
        <p>The Harambee Dance Company, an African troupe, will ''do a whole skit with stilt walking, dancers and drummers,'' said Linda Corcoran, a zoo spokeswoman. Storytellers will offer folk tales with animal themes.</p>
        <p>Children can get further into the act with art. They will make African masks and caxixis (kah-SHEE-shees), hand-held musical rattles.</p>
        <p>The Sparks Science Corner (Sparks stands for Supporting Parents in Advocacy Reform and Knowledge in Science) will hold educational activities, like Draw a Scientist.</p>
        <p>''Children tend to draw people in lab coats, very severe-looking,'' Ms. Corcoran said. Later educators will show pictures of real scientists, who look more like nice neighbors than like Frankenstein.</p>
        <p>''In fact, they're like Amy Vedder, who is in our Congo movie,'' Ms. Corcoran said. ''She's a mom.'' At each zoo event, Sparks will highlight a scientist; in this case, it is Dr. Vedder, who created a mountain gorilla project in Rwanda.</p>
        <p>The science corner will also explore family ties with the Primate Game. In one activity, children will be asked to try to button a shirt after they have put on gloves that prevent them from using their thumbs.</p>
        <p>''An opposable thumb is an important part of your adaptation as a primate,'' Ms. Corcoran explained.</p>
        <p>''Celebration Congo,'' tomorrow through Monday from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at Reptile Court, the Bronx Zoo, Bronx River Parkway at Fordham Road, Fordham, (718) 367-1010. Free with general admission: $9; the elderly and children ages 2 to 12, $5. (Admission to the Congo exhibit is an additional $3). Parking, $6.</p>
        <p>Why 2K Is O.K.</p>
        <p>The best hope for the new century may lie in the children who were born near the end of the last. Judging from the latest production by the New York Youth Theater, the world is in good hands.</p>
        <p>Called ''Y2Kids: Stories and Songs  for the New Millennium,'' the hourlong entertainment is framed by scenes in which children count down the seconds to the New Year; in the first vignette, one admits to being scared. This is less a story line, however, than a way to open a show that is part musical revue, part drama, part poetry recitation.</p>
        <p>Performed by the members of the theater's junior company, who are 5 to 11 years old, the production revolves around a simple theme: the best values for the future are to be found in the past.</p>
        <p>Don't be surprised, then, to hear music by Carole King, Harry Chapin and Irving Berlin, and stories that are even older, like ''The Little Red Hen'' and ''Mazel and Schlemazel,'' a Yiddish folk tale adapted from a translation by Isaac Bashevis Singer. One, ''The Tortoise and the Hare,'' doesn't even date from the last millennium, much less this one.</p>
        <p>Conceived by Lawrence Axmith, who wrote much of the new material, and with original music and orchestrations by Phill Greenland, ''Y2Kids'' is both exuberant and poignant. (It includes a child's poem from the Terezin Ghetto.) Peace and justice may not always triumph, it seems to say, but the means to reach them are timeless.</p>
        <p>''Y2Kids: Stories and Songs for the New Millennium,'' through June 11 at Central Presbyterian Church, 593 Park Avenue, at 64th Street, seventh floor. Fridays at 7 p.m.; Saturdays at 1 and 5 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. This holiday weekend, the only performance is tonight at 7. Tickets: $10. Reservations: (212) 888-0696.</p>
        <p>A Friendly Invasion</p>
        <p>Susan Cippoletti would rather that you not imagine Genghis Khan when you think about Mongolia. That is, if you think about Mongolia at all.</p>
        <p>This weekend you will certainly be encouraged to do so at the Children's Museum of Manhattan, where Ms. Cippoletti is the manager of public programs. As part of the citywide Festival of Mongolia, the museum will present three days of activities that will show off the country as a culture rather than a conqueror.</p>
        <p>First, children ages 6 and older will play foreign correspondents in the museum's Time Warner Media Center, where they will create a five-minute news segment.</p>
        <p>''There will be a script,'' Ms. Cippoletti said, and, thanks to technology, ''the kids will look as if they're reporting live from Mongolia.''</p>
        <p>Younger children can also perform. They will make shadow puppets, a traditional Mongolian art form, and take them to the puppet stage at the museum's Helena Rubenstein Literacy Center, where they can act out a simple folklore-based script or make up their own.</p>
        <p>For a literal taste of the culture, families can put together Mongolian vegetable dumplings in the museum's Learning Lab. (They are to be cooked at home.)</p>
        <p>On Sunday only, at 1:30 and 3:30 p.m., a folklorist who goes only by the name of Hillary (any resemblance to a senatorial candidate is purely coincidental) will offer ''Yak-ity Yak Folk Tales,'' to be accompanied by Mongolian music and displays of the country's artifacts.</p>
        <p>Mongolian Festival, through Monday at the Children's Museum of Manhattan, the Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1234. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Free with admission: $6; the elderly, $3; children under 1 and members, free.</p>
