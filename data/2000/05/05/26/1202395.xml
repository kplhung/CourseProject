        <p>PEOPLE who sell new cars like to start negotiating at the sticker price. But savvy consumers know that it makes more sense to bargain up from the invoice, or wholesale, price. If you don't know the number on the invoice, you're just not trying; the figures are ubiquitous in car buyers' guides and on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>Those who know the invoice price when they start haggling end up with deals that run $1,700 less, on average, than the salesperson's first offer, according to a recent Consumer Reports survey.</p>
        <p>Now, even more price information is available, thanks to the Internet, and the invoice is only the visible floor of the deal. Beneath it are other sources of dealer profit that buyers can try to tap.</p>
        <p>''People were walking in and saying, 'How much over invoice will you sell me this car for?' and that wasn't getting them the dealer's best offer,'' said Paige Amidon, director of Consumer Reports' car price service.</p>
        <p>To get an approximation of the dealership's true cost for a vehicle, one should also take into account two pots of money that carmakers pay to dealers: sales incentives and holdbacks. By subtracting these figures from the invoice, one comes closer to the actual price that the dealer paid for the car.</p>
        <p>The holdback is money that is intended to help cover the dealer's interest expense. Dealers, who must pay for cars when they are ordered, not when they are sold, carry loans to cover their inventory. By longstanding arrangement, most carmakers pay dealers a percentage of the invoice price, usually from 2 to 3 percent, to cover interest charges for the first 90 days. Automakers who pay 3 percent, for example, give a dealer $600 for a car with an invoice of $20,000. Dealers get the same amount whether the car sells in three days or three months.</p>
        <p>In addition, carmakers offer incentives to dealers just as they do to consumers to help move sluggish-selling models or to clear out inventories. If, as the 2000 models rolled in, a 1999 model carried a $1,000 manufacturer rebate for the customer, the older car might have carried a $1,000 rebate for the dealer, too. These incentives, for both customers and dealers, usually have expiration dates.</p>
        <p>Dealer incentive information has been available in industry journals like Automotive News for years, but it is now more accessible to consumers. Edmunds, a company that has provided automotive information for decades, has offered incentive and holdback information without charge on its Web site (www.edmunds.com) since 1996; those who want to save time seeking this and other information can get a detailed report on a specific model for $9.95. This spring, Consumer Reports started including dealer holdbacks and incentives in calculating the bottom-line price for a car in its new-car price reports. These sell for $12 each ($10 for additional reports ordered at the same time), and can be obtained at www.consumerreports.org or by calling (800) 205-2445.</p>
        <p>Harold Wells, chairman of the National Automobile Dealers Association, who is a General Motors and Chrysler dealer in Whiteville, N.C., reluctantly accepts the reality that more price information is available to consumers, but laments that too often customers come in with outdated information. That, he says, adds to mistrust when salespeople disagree with the figures.</p>
        <p>The experts agree that you should confirm the pricing as soon as possible to the time of negotiations, because automakers are shuffling incentives, prices and even holdback amounts more than ever in their efforts to grab market share.</p>
        <p>How close can you get to this rock-bottom price? Bargaining skills aside, strong demand keeps prices high. If you want a popular model, expect to pay sticker price, or close to it. ''But by showing you are aware of these factors, you can make the process more businesslike,'' Ms. Amidon said.</p>
