        <p>Travel this corner of Spain, with its endless hills of olive groves, and you begin to realize why the country thinks of itself as a kind of Saudi Arabia of olive oil.</p>
        <p>It is not just the vast scope of Spain's annual olive oil production, amounting to roughly one-third of the world total. Spanish olives, long processed for cooking, are now being transmuted into a fuel.</p>
        <p>Olive oil production leaves roughly 5.5 million tons of crushed olive pulp and skin. For the last three years, the farmers around this olive-growing hamlet, population 4,600, have delivered the residue to a specially designed power station, where it is burned to produce electricity, and hence, reduce Spain's reliance on Saudi oil.</p>
        <p>''The farmers used to dry it and burn it in ovens to heat their homes,'' said Francisco de la Torre, who manages the olive growers cooperative of Nuestra Senora de la Gracia, which unites 550 local growers. In the 1970's, when cheap natural gas arrived from North Africa, the growers began storing the foul-smelling, blackish sludge in cesspool-like pits that reeked, attracted insects and often polluted the groundwater.</p>
        <p>The power plant here, nestled between Cordoba and the sea, produces 12 megawatts of electricity, roughly enough for four villages this size. It has been so successful that the leading Spanish utility, Endesa, which built it together with the Abengoa engineering group, is about to build two more, each costing $19 million, including one near Jaen, east of Cordoba, whose groves alone account for more than 20 percent of the world's olive oil production. Endesa has said there is potential in Spain for about eight more such plants, each producing 16 megawatts.</p>
        <p>That is hardly enough to reduce Spain's electricity needs, but the project is a small sign of Europe's resolve to develop renewable sources of electricity like solar power, wind energy and biomass, that do not deplete natural resources, while helping solve the problem of industrial waste. The Spanish food processing industry produces biomass that must be disposed of at considerable cost. Mr. De La Torre's cooperative, for instance, after pressing 2,600 tons of virgin olive oil a year, is left with almost 10,000 tons of crushed olive skin and pulp.</p>
        <p>So last month, Loyola de Palacio, the European Union official responsible for energy, who is Spanish, announced that the 15-nation union would seek to double the share of electricity produced with renewable fuels in the next 10 years, to 12 percent of the total from 5.8 percent.</p>
        <p>In a country where tilting at windmills has a certain tradition, the number of giant power-generating windmills has doubled each year since 1995, to 1,400, and is expected to reach 9,000 by 2010; after selling sun to tourists for decades, Spain now uses it to produce about 9 megawatts of electricity with solar cells, about half the European total.</p>
        <p>In the United States, efforts to use natural fuels like biomass have been stymied in part by relatively low  prices for oil and natural gas. Biomass now accounts for about 3 percent of national energy use, but that also includes wood burning to heat homes.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the Clinton administration announced in August a long-term effort to triple the energy produced from crop waste and farm products by 2010. The idea, administration officials said, is to reduce reliance on imported oil, create additional farm income and generate technologies that American companies can sell abroad.</p>
        <p>Carmen Becerril, director of the Institute for Energy Diversification and Saving in Madrid, financed by the Ministry of Industry, said ''the whole secret is price.''</p>
        <p>In 1996 Spain, lacking oil and gas resources, joined other European countries, including Germany and Denmark, in providing state funds to offset the difference for consumers between the cost of providing electricity from renewable sources and the market price. Given the relatively low cost of the required technology, she said, government price supports for power generated from agricultural wastes like olive skins are a fraction of those for electricity generated by solar power or wind energy.</p>
        <p>Jose Luis Marin, who is responsible for diversification at Endesa, said the power generated at Benameji feeds a national grid. Given its relatively small share of the company's total electricity production, he said, only about 2 percent of what consumers spend for power is covered by the government subsidy.</p>
        <p>But even with government help, the path to alternative energies can be slippery. Raimon Argemi Puigdomenech, Endesa's technical director, who helped design the plant here, said the high humidity content of the olive waste hindered combustion. Moreover, hauling the olive mass from distant oil-pressing sites proved expensive.</p>
        <p>Hence, Endesa's future plants will be constructed near plants that process olive oil.</p>
        <p>Endesa sees potential export markets for its technology in other olive growing countries, including Italy, Greece and Turkey. On the Greek island of Crete, utilities are already using olive pressing waste to generate small amounts of electricity. In Cuba, Endesa is helping supply similar technology to produce power from sugar cane waste.</p>
        <p>And after that? Besides olive oil, wine is among Spain's best-known agricultural products. ''Within two years,'' Mr. Argemi said, ''we will decide whether to build a generating plant using the waste of wine-making.''</p>
