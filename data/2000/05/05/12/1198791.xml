        <p>Dr. Jay Shorr, a psychoanalyst and leading teacher of other psychoanalysts, died on Saturday at his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side. He was 75.</p>
        <p>The cause was cancer, his wife, Cynthia, said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shorr's ties to the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and Society, on East 82nd Street, spanned five decades. He was a student there and then a teacher and administrator. He also did important committee work for the American Psychoanalytic Association and maintained a psychoanalytic practice.</p>
        <p>''Many people who felt in need, colleagues and children of colleagues, would consult with him for his advice and would want to go into analysis and treatment'' with him, said Albert M. Sax, the New York Psychoanalytic Society's president.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shorr headed the institute's educational committee and played other key roles there. He also taught a conference for students near the end of their training at the institute. In such conferences, the students report on the treatment they are giving patients, and the clinical and technical issues the cases pose are then discussed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Shorr, a native of Brooklyn,  graduated from Amherst and from New York University's medical school.</p>
        <p>Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Nicholas, of Winston-Salem, N.C.; a daughter, Emily Felix of Manhattan; and a grandchild.</p>
