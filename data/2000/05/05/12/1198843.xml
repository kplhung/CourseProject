        <p>In the space of a remarkable month, South Carolina has made three momentous strides in its race relations, voting to remove one symbol profoundly offensive to black residents and creating two new ones to honor the achievements of black Americans. But without exception, those actions have been opposed by the state chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., which objected to the method necessary to achieve them.</p>
        <p>It was the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  that first engendered national criticism of the Confederate battle flag that flies on top of the State Capitol, which the General Assembly has now agreed to remove.</p>
        <p>But the association's refusal to accept the compromise has brought criticism from the black and white moderates who have always been the core of the N.A.A.C.P's national support and raises questions about the continuing effectiveness of its economic boycott of South Carolina, which was originally intended to get the flag off the dome.</p>
        <p>Just after 10 p.m. on Wednesday, the House joined the Senate in voting to remove the flag from the dome and the legislative chambers, a goal that black leaders had sought for decades. But to remove the flag, lawmakers had to agree to the demands of white supporters of the flag that a smaller Confederate battle flag fly on a 30-foot pole in front of the Statehouse, near a monument to soldiers of the Confederacy.</p>
        <p>Last month, after years of refusal, the state enacted an official holiday to observe the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., becoming the last state to do so. But to get the votes of reluctant white legislators, the General Assembly at the same time created a state holiday on Confederate Memorial Day.</p>
        <p>And this morning, a large group of state leaders broke ground for a monument celebrating African-American history on a Capitol greensward strewn with memorials to Confederate heroes, a few feet from a Statehouse built of granite quarried by slaves. But no officials of the N.A.A.C.P. were present for the event, and several black legislators, annoyed by the group's absence, said it was because a staunch flag supporter, State Senator Glenn F. McConnell, Republican of Charleston, had been a leader in getting the monument approved.</p>
        <p>The group's leaders later said that was not the reason for their absence, but they did not explain why they were not there.</p>
        <p>Although the flag is now scheduled to come down on July 1 -- assuming the Senate and the House iron out minor differences in their bills -- James Gallman, president of the state N.A.A.C.P. conference, said today that the economic sanctions against the state would continue. The group's executive board will meet soon to discuss the extent of the sanctions, Mr. Gallman said, but he predicted that some form of boycott would remain.</p>
        <p>''We had some satisfaction that the flag will be coming off the dome, and, of course, we do take credit for that partial victory that we have won,'' he said in an interview today. ''But there is still a missing piece, because the flag will still be in a position of sovereignty on the grounds. It's going to be so prominent that I've even had some people tell me it would have been better to leave it up.''</p>
        <p>The group's absolutist position -- joined by 23 of 26 black House members who voted against the flag compromise on Wednesday night -- has exasperated white moderates and many other black officials, particularly the six black senators who helped broker the compromise.</p>
        <p>Walter Edgar, director of the Institute for Southern Studies at the University of South Carolina, who was at today's groundbreaking, suggested that the boycott might begin to lose steam once the flag came down and it was no longer featured on newscasts showing the Capitol dome.</p>
        <p>''Yes, it will still be on a flagpole, but taking it off the dome is what's significant,'' Dr. Edgar said. ''Once the flag is down, I think the criticism will have less impact.''</p>
        <p>That clearly is the hope of Gov. Jim Hodges and the state's business leaders, who are now hoping to convince tourists and conventions that have canceled their bookings in the state that it is now acceptable to return.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the flag compromise have known that this moment was coming, of course, but they say the risk of now being marginalized is less important than the principle of standing up for what is right.</p>
        <p>''We don't believe in finding the easiest way out of a problem, the quickest compromise,'' said Lonnie Randolph, president of the Columbia branch of the N.A.A.C.P. ''There's always an attempt to do that when dealing with black-and-white issues, but that's not what the N.A.A.C.P. is about. We are going to stand on principle, even if that makes things more difficult.''</p>
