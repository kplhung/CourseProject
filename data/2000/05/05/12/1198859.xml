        <p>As the Heat's three-hour practice wound down today, Coach Pat Riley divided his players into two teams -- black shirts against red shirts -- and started a contest called Nets. The goal: to see how many free throws each player could make without hitting the rim.</p>
        <p>Asking for perfection from the players was Riley's answer to the Heat's woeful free-throw shooting on Tuesday night. Miami missed 14 of 33 free throws, including 7 in a row, in the Game 2 82-76 loss.</p>

        <p>As the Heat's three-hour practice wound down today, Coach Pat Riley divided his players into two teams -- black shirts against red shirts -- and started a contest called Nets. The goal: to see how many free throws each player could make without hitting the rim.</p>
        <p>Asking for perfection from the players was Riley's answer to the Heat's woeful free-throw shooting on Tuesday night. Miami missed 14 of 33 free throws, including 7 in a row, in the Game 2 82-76 loss.</p>
        <p>The contest at American Airlines Arena drew animated responses from the players until power forward P. J. Brown's swish won it for the black team.</p>
        <p>Riley first used Nets as a practice tool when he was coaching the Los Angeles Lakers to four National Basketball Association titles in the 1980's. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had objected, telling Riley that the game was making them shoot the ball higher and taking away their normal trajectory. ''We shouldn't be doing this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That Riley was still using the game indicated what he thought of Abdul-Jabbar's advice. During the regular season, the Heat made .736 percent of its free throws. However, during this series the Heat is shooting only .661 percent (37 of 56).</p>
        <p>''Somewhere, you've got to have a little levity with it,'' Riley said.</p>
        <p>The Heat could use a chuckle before Game 3 Friday night at Madison Square Garden. Familiarity with the opponent breeds knowledge, Brown added, which gives this series a unique quality.</p>
        <p>''There are no other two teams in the league like we are,'' he said. ''You're not going to see basketball played the way it's played with anybody else except these two teams.''</p>
        <p>The veteran guard Dan Majerle, while acknowledging that the Heat must play smarter than it did on Tuesday, indicated some weariness in making this series seem like Armageddon.</p>
        <p>''This has gotten bigger than New York for us,'' he said. ''New York is the team we have to beat on the way to reaching our goal.''</p>
        <p>Riley said he expects the Heat to get a scoring boost on Friday from someone other than center Alonzo Mourning and small forward Jamal Mashburn, who have accounted for more than half of the Heat's points and are averaging a combined 44.5 points a game in the series.</p>
        <p>''I do believe someone will step up big time, like Eric Murdock did, or Terry Porter or Ike Austin ,'' he said of three players who are no longer with the team.</p>
        <p>Yet, he did tell his team that it can't win by playing a ''random game,'' as he described the Game 2 loss.</p>
        <p>''We're not very good when we just play,'' he said. ''Some teams can do it. Like Sacramento. But we don't have those type of players. We have a scheme and when we operate within it, we're good. When we play randomly, we're not.''</p>
        <p>One of the few Heat players able to function well in a free-lance environment is Mashburn, who is averaging 23 points a game in the series. But Riley believes the referees have not accepted him as a bona fide star.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the officials look at Mash yet like they do Houston,'' he said, referring to Allan Houston. ''Any fouls he draws, he has to earn. Everything Allan gets is off a touch. They touch him and he's on the line. It's probably going to take Mash a couple more playoffs to get that kind of respect.''</p>
        <p>While Mashburn has made advances in this series, Houston took a step backward in Tuesday's game. With Majerle almost overplaying him and Mourning providing near-the-basket support, Houston settled for 12 points, on 3-of-14 shooting.</p>
        <p>But as Riley said, expect the Knicks to adjust. ''You learn to expect the unexpected in this series.''</p>
