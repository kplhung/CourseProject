        <p>Hofstra has been to the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I men's lacrosse tournament before, and each of those appearances was greeted with a celebration on campus. This year, with a berth in the tournament already secured thanks to the Flying Dutchmen's status as America East champions, the reaction was different. Hofstra is hoping the result will be different, too.</p>
        <p>The Flying Dutchmen will open the 12-team tournament on Sunday against the University of Maryland at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, one of four opening-round games.</p>
        <p>''We've made the tournament in four of the last five years,'' Hofstra Coach John Danowski said. ''But in years past it would have been a big deal just to make it. Last year we needed to beat Johns Hopkins in the last game to make the playoffs, and the year before we beat Hopkins and North Carolina to make it. There was tremendous euphoria then.''</p>
        <p>''Now our seniors have done this before. That's the nice thing I like about this team. They haven't gotten too high or too low. With the leadership of the seniors, they are approaching it like it's just the next game, and I think that's a positive.''</p>
        <p>What unseeded Hofstra (11-4) has gained is a meeting with sixth-seeded Maryland (10-4), which reached the championship game in 1997 and in 1998. The two have not met since 1987, and Hofstra has beaten Maryland only once in eight meetings, but the two teams scrimmaged in February and Danowski believes his squad can compete.</p>
        <p>The winner will advance to the quarterfinals and will face third-seeded Princeton at Rutgers on May 21, with top-seeded Syracuse facing the winner of the Cornell-Georgetown match.</p>
        <p>Hofstra has gotten past the opening round twice in its history, last season and in 1993. Last season the Dutchmen advanced to the quarterfinals, but then lost to Johns Hopkins, 11-7.</p>
        <p>Leading the Dutchmen this season has been the attacker Tim Kessler, a sophomore from Hicksville, N.Y. He has scored 44 goals this year, the second-best single-season total in school history and just five short of the record set by Michael Lacrosse in 1989. Playing on an all-sophomore attacking line with Joe Kostolansky and Scott Dooley, Kessler has helped Hofstra score 13.33 goals a game this season, eighth-best in the nation.</p>
        <p>The Terrapins' goalie, Pat McGinnis, ranks seventh in the nation with a .628 saves percentage, allowing 108 goals but making 182 saves.</p>
        <p>''Maryland is a terrific team,'' Danowski said. ''They're very athletic with a terrific goalie who is capable of winning the game on his own. They have an athletic defense and they play great together. Their first midfield may be as good as any in the country.''</p>
        <p>DIVISION I WOMEN BEGIN TOURNAMENT</p>
        <p>The women's Division I lacrosse tournament began yesterday with four opening-round games.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, top-seeded Maryland, the five-time defending champion, will play host to Georgetown, which defeated Syracuse, 11-10; No. 2 Princeton will play host to Duke, a 7-6 winner over Dartmouth; No. 3 James Madison will play host to Virginia, which beat Boston University, 13-10; and No. 4 North Carolina will play Loyola, which topped Delaware, 14-4.</p>
        <p>The semifinals will be played at the College of New Jersey next Friday and the final will be May 21.</p>
        <p>The Maryland women's team showed the first sign of vulnerability in four years this season with the end of its string of three consecutive seasons without a loss. In the season's second game, the Terps lost to North Carolina. But they finished the season with 16 consecutive victories to finish 17-1, including a 14-6 victory over second-seeded Princeton on April 26.</p>
