        <p>Sweat pores, ulcer-causing bacteria and gallbladder parts, all replicated and much enlarged in yellow cast rubber, are the stuff of Jeanne Silverthorne's sculpture, along with yards of complex but functionless black rubber cable, switch boxes and industrial lighting fixtures that snake along the floor and fasten to the wall.</p>
        <p>An ironist chipping away at ''arty'' values, she is concerned, as Eva Hesse was, with the means and materials of sculpture rather than with its end product. And why can't it be body processes and orifices or studio fixtures as well as anything else?</p>

        <p>McKee Gallery</p>
        <p>745 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through June 3</p>
        <p>Sweat pores, ulcer-causing bacteria and gallbladder parts, all replicated and much enlarged in yellow cast rubber, are the stuff of Jeanne Silverthorne's sculpture, along with yards of complex but functionless black rubber cable, switch boxes and industrial lighting fixtures that snake along the floor and fasten to the wall.</p>
        <p>An ironist chipping away at ''arty'' values, she is concerned, as Eva Hesse was, with the means and materials of sculpture rather than with its end product. And why can't it be body processes and orifices or studio fixtures as well as anything else?</p>
        <p>''Fingerprint With Thorns,'' a blown-up fingerprint in cast rubber framed in a square adorned with writhing rubber thorns, is an easy read. But some of the work is a little more complicated, like ''Sweat Pore,'' a writhing mass of spaghettilike strands and clumps punctuated by tiny holes. Ms. Silverthorne also takes bits of detritus left over from the casting process and blows them up into swollen, biomorphic shapes, like ''Two Fragments,'' a pair of yellow blobs set like high sculpture on a black base.</p>
        <p>The studio where she carries on her inquiries is very much part of the show, in a miniature tabletop version. It contains, among other pieces of equipment, a chair next to a file cabinet that spills over with tiny photographs (also arrayed on a nearby wall), representing a complete archive of drab photographs of studio sites and works in process from 1992 to the present. To paraphrase the Fairway market solgan, it's a show like no other.</p>
