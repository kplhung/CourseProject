        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free.  * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>Museums</p>
        <p>* ''ART AND ORACLE: SPIRIT VOICES OF AFRICA,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through July 30). This is the first big international loan exhibition of African art to appear at the Met outside the Michael C. Rockefeller wing, and it is gorgeous. The subject is divination, the practice of channeling superhuman knowledge to predict the future, diagnose illness and promote social harmony. Nearly every object here has a role in that process or reflects its effects, from a ''power figure'' that looks as explosive as a stick of dynamite, to a Yoruba divination tray believed to be the oldest African wood sculpture in the West, to the portrait of a king who was warned by diviners to beware of water and had himself depicted as half-fish. (He ended up in exile far across the Atlantic in Martinique.) Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Suggested admission: $10 for adults; $5 for students and the elderly (Holland Cotter).</p>

        <p>* ''ART AND ORACLE: SPIRIT VOICES OF AFRICA,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through July 30). This is the first big international loan exhibition of African art to appear at the Met outside the Michael C. Rockefeller wing, and it is gorgeous.

        <p>''BIENNIAL 2000,'' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through June 4). A show without a theme: no strong point of view, not much sex, no dead pigs, no fecal matter or rotting eggs or mannequins with a penis for a nose. Sounds boring, no? This committee-organized Biennial goes out of its way to be ecumenical, independent, geographically diverse, representative of all media including the Internet and different from what the New York power brokers would do. All this may be admirable. It's also truer than previous biennials to what goes on across the country; truer to the character of the American scene, where artists come from other countries; more respectful of different generations and multiple strategies. And flat. Notwithstanding Hans Haacke's forgettable noisemaker, it is the most uncontroversial Whitney biennial in years, which is not good. Hours: Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 1 to 8 p.m. Admission: $12.50; $10.50, students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''COLLECTION IN CONTEXT,'' Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500 (through May 28). This group show, organized from the permanent collection by the museum's new director of exhibitions and programs, Thelma Golden, has all kinds of smart alignments and enchanting pairings. Between two impressive portraits -- a girl in vermilion slippers by the African-American artist Joshua Johnson (circa 1735-1830) and Barkley Hendricks's image of a 1970's Black Pride beauty set against a gilded background like a Renaissance saint -- come small pieces by Sister Gertrude Morgan, Alma Thomas, Meta Warrick Fuller and Jacob Lawrence that feel like discovered gifts. Also on view is a selection of Harlem photographs by James VanDerZee. Hours: Wednesdays and Thursdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Fridays, noon to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''MAKING CHOICES, 1920-1960,'' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Sept. 26). The main event at the  Modern these days is the museum itself. This has been the case since last fall, when the project ''MOMA 2000'' began the first of what will be three successive top-to-bottom reinstallations of the permanent collection galleries. The affair has been billed as a test drive toward the future, a chance for an institution to rethink the modern art tradition it helped invent and to consider its own identity in what is often called a postmodern world. This second installment, which looks denser, weirder, messier and more truly modern (or maybe postmodern) than the first, is a big leap in the right direction. Hours: Thursdays through Tuesdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* MICHELANGELO TO PICASSO: MASTER DRAWINGS FROM THE COLLECTION OF THE ALBERTINA, VIENNA,'' Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700 (through June 18). The Albertina, which has one of the world's greatest collections of works on paper, houses some 65,000 drawings and watercolors and nearly a million prints, from Gothic to contemporary. The small sampling of 45 drawings and watercolors here runs from Michelangelo to Jackson Pollock and includes many works that have never before left Austria. Standouts include Leonardo's ''Half-Length of an Apostle''; four drawings by Albrecht Durer, including his ''Head of an Old Man'' (1521); Michelangelo's anatomical study ''Seated Male Nude with Two Arms''; and Raphael's ''Madonna and Child.'' There are also works by Rubens, Rembrandt, Poussin, Claude Lorrain, van Gogh, Picasso, Klimt, Schiele, Chagall and lesser-knowns. It is not often that one gets to see this range of masters packed into one small show, a fine teaser for the full Albertina experience. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck).</p>
        <p>* ''THE PRINZHORN COLLECTION: TRACES UPON THE WUNDERBLOCK,'' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166 (through June 10). The legendary Prinzhorn Collection, amassed just before and after World War I in Heidelberg, Germany, is one of the originating points of the study and appreciation of art by the insane. The collection's first New York appearance is a mine of exciting new information: 200 drawings and handmade books that often stun the eye and always touch the heart, by mostly unfamiliar artists. It is also very much a time capsule; its contents clearly reflect an era when penmanship was taught and valued, when ledgers were kept, and when religious images and farm animals were part of everyday life. Its suggestion that the art of the insane is not pure, timeless and autonomous, but part of a larger continuum of art and visual culture, may be the exhibition's most valuable lesson. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free (Roberta Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Uptown</p>
        <p>FREDERIC EDWIN CHURCH, ''In Search of the Promised Land,'' Berry-Hill, 11 East 70th Street, (212) 744-2300 (through July 15). This sumptuous exhibition of 50 works, the largest in New York in nearly 30 years, spans most of Church's long career, offering opportunities to contrast his innate early talent with its maturation, his reverence for the American landscape with his depiction of exotic foreign sites, and his grand, sometimes grandiose finished statements with his small animated studies (Smith).</p>
        <p>''THE COLLECTOR AS PATRON IN THE 20TH CENTURY,'' Knoedler &amp; Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550 (through July 31). This two-tiered exhibition honors American collectors present and past. Upstairs an exemplary selection from five private collections summarizes postwar American art. Downstairs a fascinating archival display of correspondence, photographs and color reproductions profiles 28 important American collections, tracing their impact on American museums and offering tantalizing glimpses of their dealings with Knoedler, the oldest living art gallery in New York (Smith).</p>
        <p>WILLEM DE KOONING, ''Mostly Women,'' Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313 (through June 30). Dominated by de Kooning's lush, disheveled paintings and drawings of women from the middle 1960's, this show has the intimacy and excitement of a visit to the artist's studio. The works, from the collection of John and Kimiko Powers, come in all shapes and sizes and are executed on whatever's-handy surfaces -- from paper towels to hollow-core doors. They are often affectionately inscribed by the artist (Smith).</p>
        <p>* LUCIAN FREUD, Acquavella Gallery, 18 East 79th Street, (212) 734-6300 (through May 19). The emotional pitch of this show, Mr. Freud's first in New York in four years, is subtler than last time. Of 35 paintings and prints, three are landscapes, including a big bird's-eye view of the shuttered garden beside his London town house, an antipicturesque image that is about the elevating value of steady, unforgiving observation. The same philosophy applies to the pictures of people, some of his best in years, including a vertiginous, voluptuously painted portrait of a female model face down and a portrait of his daughter Ib reading. At the heart of the art is the idea that truth without sentiment is beauty, and that beauty becomes erotic not when it involves an attractive naked young woman on a bed, but when it attaches to deep feeling. There are not many artists today operating on this level (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* LEON KOSSOFF, Mitchell-Innes &amp; Nash, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 744-7400 (through May 20). Mr. Kossoff's show includes more than 20 paintings and drawings of his neighborhood around Kings Cross Station in London. He has studied this neighborhood season by season: what may at first glance look like inspired squiggles turn out to be close observations of fact. There are also some very fine portrait drawings and large paintings of old friends doing nothing in particular in the studio and wearing nothing at all. The strong, clear light of New York gives these works a particular radiance. (A completely different aspect of Mr. Kossoff at work can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where 14 of his etchings after Poussin are on view through Aug. 13.) (John Russell).</p>
        <p>FRANCIS PICABIA, ''Late Works,'' Michael Werner, 4 East 77th Street, (212) 988-1623 (through June 9). From Cubism and Dada to postmodernism, there is hardly a 20th-century art movement that this maverick French modernist hasn't contributed to or presaged. This show confirms his prescience and his stylistic profligacy, but also reveals the high levels of painterly experimentation, curiosity and passion basic to his perpetual motion (Smith).</p>
        <p>''WOMEN OF WARHOL: MARILYN, LIZ AND JACKIE,'' C &amp; M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020 (through June 3). A ghostly, evanescent power permeates this show, a result of Warhol's tissue-thin pictorial magic, his canny eye for the iconic potential of everyday images -- whether from movie magazines, publicity stills or newspapers -- and his correct assumption that the weight of history could anchor his seemingly ephemeral art (Smith).</p>
        <p>Galleries: 57th Street</p>
        <p>ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO, ''Terra Cotta Sculptures,'' Zabriskie Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1223 (through June 10). These suave, mostly small terra cotta figures were made by Archipenko (1887-1964), an innovator in early 20th-century sculpture, during the 1930's. They deal with the female form, from solid, sensuous torso to near-abstraction in which open spaces play a role. One of their distinctive features is elegant surface finish, highly polished with the addition of colored elements and inlays to the basic structure. He is at his best in several beautifully modeled torsos of idealized figures that reach for the spiritual essence of form (Glueck).</p>
        <p>''AND AWAY WE GO,'' Baron/Boisante, 50 West 57th Street, (212) 581-9191 (through June 3). For its last exhibition at this site, this valuable little gallery presents a show about moving. It includes a clunky wooden truck by Chris Macdonald; a slyly self-referential photograph of a truck by Jennifer Bolande; exquisite, tiny photographs of misassembled model helicopter parts by Sandrine Guerin; a disappearing white deer by Not Vital and faux-primitive paintings by Michael Byron and Donald Baechler called, respectively, ''Change of Address'' and ''The Goodbye Painting'' (Ken Johnson).</p>
        <p>ENRIQUE CHAGOYA, George Adams, 41 West 57th Street, (212) 644-5665 (through May 20). A gifted caricaturist and mimic, this Mexico-born Californian gives expression to a wildly pluralistic imagination. In a 10-foot horizontal scroll called ''An American Primitive in Paris,'' Superman, Jesus, goofy characters from French comics, Aztec diagrams, Claude Monet and Che Guevera come together in a comic panoply of images that fiercely satirize the enduring legacy of Western cultural elitism (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''WARHOL AND BEATON: DESIGN AND DRAFTSMANSHIP,'' Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331 (through May 20). In the 1950's the British stage designer Cecil Beaton was at the peak of his career and an object of fascination for Andy Warhol, then a young, up-and-coming commercial illustrator. This show of drawings from that decade by both artists is meant to demonstrate the older man's influence on the younger in terms of artistic as well as personal style. You can see the affinity, but it is Warhol who steals the show; next to his insouciant elegance, Beaton's costume-design drawings look stiff and generic (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: SoHo</p>
        <p>''ECHO,'' Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970 (through May 20). If this four-artist show has a point, it is easy not to get it. But Hajime Nakamura's yolklike yellow balls bobbling in milky liquid and Iris Binor's sleek color photographs of people in oddly simulated and deconstructed environments may pique interest. In addition, Shawn King progressively blows up his old high school in an eight-part photographic sequence and Trisha Donnelly shows an annoying video of a woman with fashion-model looks who repeatedly leaps into the air (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''PAINTING GENERATION,'' Kagan Martos, 515 Broadway, near Spring Street, (212) 343-4293 (through May 20). This intriguing eight-work show traces an eccentric art history from 1920 to 2000. It includes a cluster of ink dots by Francis Picabia (1920); a lovely grisaille by Yves Tanguy (1946); gritty Abstract Expressionism by Alfred Leslie (1951); near-Minimalist elegance by Jo Baer (1970); soft, gray luminosity by Ross Bleckner (1981); zany calligraphic images and patterns by Amy Sillman (1995); and a mysterious, spider-webbed tchotchke painted by Randy Wray (2000) (Johnson).</p>
        <p>ROBERT ZANDVLIET, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441 (through June 10). For his first New York solo show, this young Dutch painter presents a group of large, black-and-white, Abstract Expressionist-style monotypes. They are less interesting, however, than five egg tempera-on-canvas paintings also on view. The latter, layered compositions of wide, crisscrossing brush strokes, call to mind Franz Kline, Gerhard Richter and David Reed, but have their own attractively muted color and buttery sensuousness (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Galleries: Chelsea</p>
        <p>GILLIAN CARNEGIE, Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000 (through May 27). This young British artist brings to the act of painting a searching and inventive curiosity. Whether picturing landscape, still life, a back-alley stairway at night or sexy, bare female bottoms, she is intensely alert to the possible ways this inert, gooey stuff called paint can be brought to life. Her mostly small-scale work is subtly complicated, unpredictably textured and sensuous (Johnson).</p>
        <p>RENE DANIELS, Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100 (through June 3). Conceptual painting is in. Artists like Martin Kippenberger, Elizabeth Peyton and Luc Tuymans are fashionable, and suddenly this neglected Dutch painter, whose career was stopped by illness in 1987, looks like a prophet. The pictures of trees, swans and the receding inside of a gallery, sometimes abstracted into the shape of a bow tie, wring symbolist poetry from ordinary stuff, effortlessly (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* PAT DE GROOT, Pat Hearn, 530 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-7366 (through May 20). Every day, Ms. de Groot, who is in her early 70's, makes a new painting of the ocean from her window in Provincetown, Mass. This is her first New York solo show. Her small panels have a blocky physicality that calls to mind Robert Ryman or Agnes Martin, yet each records atmospheric conditions with exquisite specificity, from the whiteout of dense fog to the bracing contrasts of a breezy sunny day (Johnson).</p>
        <p>FRANK GILLETTE, Universal Concepts Unlimited, 507 West 24th Street, (212) 727-7575 (through May 27). Mr. Gillette, a video-art pioneer three decades ago, here shows works produced by newer technology: swirling, complicatedly layered black-and-white abstractions made with a computer mouse and drawing software. Turned into iris prints and stuck to aluminum panels, they look impersonal and disembodied; as objects on the wall, however, they have a certain hovering, futuristic presence (Johnson).</p>
        <p>CLAUDIA HART AND SAM SAMORE, ''Playworld,'' Clinica Aesthetica, 427 West 14th Street, (212) 243-5345 (through May 20). This collaborative multimedia installation about childhood and fairy tales, in the form of a brightly painted but rather empty playroom, looks like a work in progress with interesting possibilities. In an animated video by Ms. Hart, bizarre twin pigs squeal ''Mama! Mama!'' continually; Mr. Samore contributes a frieze of evocative phrases like ''stealing the newborn'' or ''devouring beauty'' and a large, romantically hazy, inkjet printed portrait of a little boy (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MADELEINE HATZ, Florence Lynch Gallery, 147 West 29th Street, (212) 967-7584 (through May 27). Working in two and three dimensions, Ms. Hatz pursues a two-pronged  enterprise. Each of her canvases is a colorful, richly painterly abstraction suggestive of roiling, sun-drenched clouds; in sculpture, she simulates slightly miniaturized brick-and-mortar rubble and arranges it on steel platforms. The viewer swings back and forth between the celestial and the terrestrial (Johnson).</p>
        <p>BETSY KAUFMAN, Leslie Tonkonow, 601 West 26th Street, (212) 255-8450 (through May 20). Ms. Kaufman's precise and sensuous paintings are always based on the grid, but are otherwise unpredictably various. ''Wavers'' is a dazzling field of fine vertical lines; ''Blue Text,'' a luminous layering of streaky, pale blue paint, skewed white horizontal lines and fine dots. The paintings seem at once mathematical and poetic (Johnson).</p>
        <p>MARILYN MINTER, XL Xavier LaBoulbenne, 504 West 22nd Street, (212) 462-4111 (through May 20). The enamel-on-metal paintings in this show are based on close-up photographs Ms. Minter took of a man wearing women's clothes and makeup. A bit of lace falls across a hirsute chest. A set of tough-looking toenails are painted avocado green. Like Surrealism, work by Ms. Minter mines the fetishistic charge of the anatomical fragment, and turns gender-scrambling eroticism into high theater (Cotter).</p>
        <p>LUCA PIGNATELLI, Generous Miracles, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 352-2858 (through June 15). Big, brooding and theatrical, the paintings by this Italian artist could be overbearing and portentous but they are not. Rather, ghostly pictures of a World War II bomber flying over a mountain lake or a massive, charging locomotive or snowy forests -- all realized in dark stains on distressed, stitched-together tarps -- are ruggedly physical and mysteriously romantic (Johnson).</p>
        <p>PIPILOTTI RIST, Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100 (through May 27). The New York solo gallery debut for this prominent Swiss artist mixes installation, sound and video. She concocts an overstuffed 60's living room. Videos tinker with voyeurism, lust and female angst. They have a winsome, self-mocking air, low-tech in style but secretly suave. The work, her best in a while, operates almost subliminally, as if on the verge of speech. The show coincides with a less successful Public Art Fund project: one-minute videos on the big screen in Times Square, every hour at a quarter past, through May 20 (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>Other Galleries</p>
        <p>CHARLES CAJORI, New York Studio School, 8 West Eighth Street, (212) 673-6466 (through May 20). As his four-decade drawing retrospective shows, this esteemed New York Studio School teacher has always worked with the tension between the fixed reality of the female nude and the flux of perceptual and gestural response. Most of his drawings have an agitated concentration, with much overdrawing and erasing. More recent works, freed from frenetic mark making, have an incisive awkwardness and the suggestion of an Asian brevity (Johnson).</p>
        <p>''CONCEPTUAL INK,'' Ethan Cohen Fine Arts, 37 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 625-1250 (through May 20). This inventive gathering offers a contemporary look at the role of language and ink-and-brush painting in Chinese art, as a formal and intellectual medium. Some artists, like Gu Wenda and Xu Bing, are familiar in New York; others live in China where they are producing highly experimental work. The eminent painter and collector C. C. Wang is represented by calligraphy brushed onto pages of New York City phone books, a conceptual gesture that joins the individualist mark-making of one culture with printed evidence of the diversity of another (Cotter).</p>
        <p>KAREN GUNDERSON, ''Moral Courage During World War II: Denmark and Bulgaria,'' Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, 1 West Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 824-2205 (through June 21). It has been done in literature and film, but can painting and drawing convey any of the moral complexity associated with the Holocaust? Ms. Gunderson's black-on-black portraits of Danish and Bulgarian kings who aided the Jews, illustrative charcoal drawings of civilian heroes and allegorical visions of nautical escape may have memorial value for some viewers, but they are vacuous as expressions of moral insight or celebration (Johnson).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>* JENNIFER BARTLETT, Lawrence Rubin, Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212) 445-0444 (through tomorrow). Ms. Bartlett continues her use of the rambling, multipart grid system established by her painting ''Rhapsody,'' which first brought her acclaim 25 years ago. On the square plates that form the grid, her imagery -- abstract or narrative -- is formed by dots. In her narrative paintings she shapes them into trees, figures, houses and domestic rites by manipulating their colors. But in her more vivacious abstractions, the dots take on their own personae, sometimes confined to grids but others expanding into brilliantly colored, sometimes ringed, circles of various sizes bursting out of their rigid confinement to form throbbing patchwork quilts of chromatic dazzle. They are her best and brightest (Glueck).</p>
        <p>* WALKER EVANS, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Sunday). It is curious that such a prickly man could have made such affecting photographs, but maybe that is why they are moving: sentiment is perfectly balanced by dispassion. Evans was after a poetry that would not be called beautiful, not conventionally beautiful anyway. The Met's outstanding survey, the first complete Evans retrospective, sweeps across six decades, including the photographs he took with a Polaroid SX-70 in 1973 and '74, which were his last works. We see what we already knew: that American documentary photography is derived from his mordant concentration, his elevation of the everyday and his belligerent independence, which was maybe his most truly American trait. Hours and admission: See above (Kimmelman).</p>
        <p>* ''GREATER NEW YORK,'' P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Tuesday). This huge survey of new art is the first curatorial collaboration between P.S. 1 and the Museum of Modern Art. With a whopping 150 artists, it is a themeless, selected-by-committee show with the kind of institutional clout that can make the art world see red. The same formula has caused the Whitney Biennial headaches for years, but in this case it works. It ends up producing a good if uneven exhibition with flashes of inspiration. Its tone is low key, distinctly unsensational. With a third of the artists foreign born, there is a cosmopolitan undercurrent. It leaves a million things out. (New York has dozens of art worlds; only a few are represented here.) But as a highly selective recap of what's cooking in new art locally -- in this case the five boroughs, along with a fringe of Westchester -- it is invaluable. In short, an important beginning to the decade. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5 (Cotter).</p>
        <p>* ''MILLENNIAL DREAMS: VISION AND PROPHECY IN AMERICAN FOLK ART,'' Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533 (through Sunday). With all the Y2K furor, it's easy to forget that for most Americans not so long ago the turn of the millennium carried profound spiritual weight: it signified the end of time, the culmination of history, when good and evil faced off and the heavenly kingdom arrived on earth. This intelligent and stirring show explores these ideas in works ranging from the apocalyptic paintings of the Pentecostal preacher William A. Blayney to Sister Gertrude Morgan's visions of an interracial paradise to Edward Hicks's earthly lions-with-lambs ''Peaceable Kingdom.'' At the center of everything is a set of Shaker chairs, each as plain and elegant as a hymn book tune and suspended together in space like a stairway to heaven. Just perfect. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Cotter).</p>
        <p>''PICTURING BUSINESS: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF FORTUNE, 1930-1965,'' International Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777 (through Sunday). A show of 154 original prints of photographs published in Fortune's early years, along with a number of the actual issues. The magazine employed top photographers, from Margaret Bourke-White to Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans to Robert Frank, and the many images here make it clear how important Fortune was to telling stories in pictures. In its more formal and elegant way, it laid the groundwork for Life. Hours: Today, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; tomorrow and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $6; $4, students and the elderly; $1, children under 12 (Vicki Goldberg).</p>
        <p>* ''TILMAN RIEMENSCHNEIDER: MASTER SCULPTOR OF THE LATE MIDDLE AGES,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Sunday). This stunning show is the first full-scale survey of the greatest of the late 14th-century German sculptors, creator of some of the most quietly virtuosic, spiritually focused yet undeniably dynamic figurative works of Western sculpture. There are 60 works from 45 ensembles, usually close to life-size, in the round and in relief, in sandstone, alabaster and limewood. The great monochrome carved pieces predominate, with alpine topographies of drapery that wrap their revered subjects in what are effectively abstract sculptures. They are radical, mesmerizingly complex visual propositions whose crystalline forms and introspective faces speak simultaneously of the power of human faith and aesthetic will. Hours and admission: See above (Smith).</p>
        <p>TOM GIDLEY/MARTIN WEBER, the Project, 427 West 126th Street, Harlem, (212) 662-8610 (through Sunday). Among interesting recent developments for contemporary art in Harlem is the presence of this gallery with a roster of young artists from Europe, Asia, Africa and the United States. Currently, two figures with international reputations are making New York solo debuts. A short video by Tom Gidley, from Britain, has the romantic drive of a Schubert sonata. Martin Weber, based in Buenos Aires, is represented by a Felliniesque series of photographs titled ''Dreams,'' in which the subjects hold placards carrying a one-line description of their fondest wish for the future. The results are wry, tender, enigmatic (Cotter).</p>
