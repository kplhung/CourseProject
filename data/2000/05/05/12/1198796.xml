        <p>Federal agents wielding guns and wearing black masks staged a raid on the downtown headquarters of Russia's largest private media empire today, raising alarms among politicians and journalists about the prospects for an independent press under President Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>The corporate offices of Media-MOST, a holding company that has been in and out of political favor with the Kremlin for years, controls influential radio and television stations as well as a newspaper, a news magazine and other publications, were still being searched tonight as top law enforcement officials issued conflicting statements on the purpose of the criminal investigation.</p>
        <p>MOST officials condemned the action as a crude attempt at political intimidation against a media group that had already been isolated by the Kremlin in recent months for taking a critical view of Mr. Putin, some members of his administration and the conduct of the ongoing war in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>''It is obvious that what is going on is a factor of political pressure,'' said Vladimir Gusinsky, president and founder of Media-MOST, who flew back to Moscow from Israel today to handle the crisis. ''It is a simply a pity that just a few days after the new president of Russia took office -- the president on whom many people pin hope for a rebirth of the country -- it looks like everything is going backwards, the same masks, the same special services, the same witch hunting.''</p>
        <p>In a statement tonght, Aleksandr Zdanovich, a spokesman for the F.S.B., the federal domestic intelligence agency that is the successor to the K.G.B., said that the search of Media-MOST offices had turned up recordings and files containing evidence against the company's managers and correspondents.</p>
        <p>Charges by Media-MOST officials that the raid was politically motivated were ''but an attempt to distract the attention of the public from the holding's financial problems,'' Mr. Zdanovich said. ''They are trying to conceal the true reasons for what is happening.''</p>
        <p>Media MOST was the target of a raid by federal special agents in 1994, after NTV, its flagship television station, began critical broadcasts about Russia's first war against Chechnya. This time, the investigation was not so rough, but no less thorough as federal agents -- representing a collection of agencies from the tax police, to the security police to the general prosecutor's office -- carted out boxes of documents, equipment and even cassetttes of popular television programs reportedly taken from Mr. Gusinsky's own office at the company's recently opened headquarters on a quiet Moscow side street.</p>
        <p>Coming in the first week of the Putin administration, at a time when observers here and abroad are waiting to see what Russia's new president will do his powers, the raid today was widely seen as an inauspicious beginning.</p>
        <p>''What we saw was some kind of a military operation -- camouflage, weapons, seizure of big buildings, lots of people,'' said Oleg Mironov, who heads the Russian Parliament's human rights committee. ''It is an alarming fact, a demonstration of force that is undermining the authority of Vladimir Putin who just took office, proclaiming the ideas of democracy.''</p>
        <p>Even those politicians who withheld judgment on the purpose of the raid were strongly critical of the methods. ''A suspicion immediately arises that it may be linked with dissatsifaction with the channel's information policy,'' said Sergei V. Kiriyenko, a former prime minister and leader of a liberal party. ''Even if this is not true, such methods of operations allows doubts, and discredits the noblest of motives that the tax service might have.''</p>
        <p>Mikhail Berger, the chief editor of Segnodnya, Media-MOST's daily newspaper, said he was certain that federal investigators were set on finding evidence to compromise the entire media empire, and to silence critics of the Putin administration.</p>
        <p>''They are looking for anything,'' he said. ''There was an order issued -- from Putin, from whomever -- to find whatever at Media-MOST. It is like a military command: find something, anything, no matter the cost.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berger said he had anticipated a harsh reaction to recent investigative articles that focused on top officers of the F.S.B., Mr. Putin's old employer.</p>
        <p>The MOST media group has been at loggerheads with the Kremlin for the last year, ever since its reporters, both for print media and television, began to aggressively cover charges of high-level corruption in the presidential administration.</p>
        <p>The conflict deepened as Russia's  election season began, and Media-MOST shifted its support to the anti-Kremlin opposition, headed by Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow.</p>
        <p>One of Media-MOST group's chief enemies is Aleksandr Voloshin, the chief of the Kremlin staff and a holdover from the administration of former President Boris N. Yeltsin, who has openly vowed to destroy Mr. Gusinsky's media empire.</p>
        <p>''Several members of the president's administration didn't make it a secret that they regard MOST media as the only signficant opposition in the country,'' said Masha Lipman, a deputy editor at Itogi, the group's weekly news magazine.</p>
        <p>When the raid began shortly after 9 a.m., federal authorities offered no explanations at all. According to a news report on NTV, the agents did not identify themselves, or show any documents, as they began to search the premises and interrogate employees.</p>
        <p>Unofficial spokesman at first told Russian news agencies that the raid was connected with an investigation, now several years old, into a former Finance Ministry official, and that the company was being charged with disclosure of commercial secrets. By the end of the day, both the Russian General Prosecutor's office and the Federal Security Service said they were investigating Media-MOST's private security operations, which they said had been involved in illegal surveillance.</p>
        <p>Media-MOST, like many other major Russian corporations, has hired former top-ranking members of the old Soviet K.G.B. to run security services and a wide-ranging intelligence-gathering network.</p>
