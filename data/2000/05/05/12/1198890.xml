        <p>Palm Inc. said yesterday that it had named Citron Haligman Bedecarre in San Francisco to handle its account, with billings estimated at $70 million. The decision came less than one week after Palm parted ways with its agency of two years, the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, because that agency was named to handle the $350 million account of the Compaq Computer Corporation.</p>

        <p>Palm Inc. said yesterday that it had named Citron Haligman Bedecarre in San Francisco to handle its account, with billings estimated at $70 million. The decision came less than one week after Palm parted ways with its agency of two years, the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, because that agency was named to handle the $350 million account of the Compaq Computer Corporation.</p>
        <p>Liz Brooking, a spokeswoman for Palm in Santa Clara, Calif., said that the decision came without a review but that Palm had a backup plan once it had been informed that FCB was involved in the Compaq review. Citron Haligman ''actually approached us during the Compaq pitch,'' Ms. Brooking said.</p>
