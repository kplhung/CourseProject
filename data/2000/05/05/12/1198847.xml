        <p>Following are excerpts of the closing statements of former Gov. Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine during the senatorial debate yesterday in Trenton, as recorded by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Jim Florio -- Social Security is a defining issue of this campaign. It is important in and of itself, but it also is important because it tells you a lot about someone's attitude towards America, and our values. Jon and the Republicans want to look to the private sector. Jon wants to put the money into the stock market. The Republicans overtly want to privatize it. What that essentially is saying is that there's a philosophy there that says everyone's for themselves, and the devil take the hindmost. I reject that philosophy. I'm pleased that the president rejects it, the vice president rejects it, I do, and I think most of the members of the New Jersey Congressional delegation reject it. . . .</p>
        <p>Jon S. Corzine</p>
        <p>Tonight I think the voters of New Jersey have seen a clear contrast between the old politics and the future. I think the voters can see unequivocally the difference between an agenda of progress and my opponent's personal attacks. These debates, this campaign, should be a contest of ideas, and not distortions. The governor wants to pick a fight; I prefer to fight for the people of New Jersey. This is why I've offered a bold agenda on the things that I want to repeat: improving education, access to health care, providing an affordable prescription drug benefit for our seniors, revitalizing our cities through my renaissance bank, and fighting to end racial profiling. And let me repeat, I stand with President Clinton for securing and strengthening Social Security....</p>
