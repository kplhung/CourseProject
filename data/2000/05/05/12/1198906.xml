        <p>A Yale Law School graduate who stabbed his pregnant fiancee to death after he had become a role model for the mentally ill will not stand trial for her death but will be committed indefinitely to a state psychiatric hospital, a judge ruled today.</p>
        <p>The judge, Daniel Angiolillo of Westchester County Court, accepted a plea of ''not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect'' from Michael B. Laudor, who two years ago killed his fiancee, Caroline Costello, in their apartment in Hastings-on-Hudson. At the time, Mr. Laudor, who had successfully battled schizophrenia, had stopped responding to medication and had become severely delusional.</p>
        <p>Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, tried to prosecute Mr. Laudor and won an indictment on a charge of second-degree murder. But the case was derailed in March when the prosecution's psychiatrist, Dr. Park Dietz, concluded that Mr. Laudor was insane at the time of the killing, and thought Ms. Costello was not human but a ''robot'' or ''doll'' acting on behalf of a conspiracy to kill him.</p>
        <p>At the hearing today, the district attorney's office reviewed the events of the killing and its aftermath in horrific detail. Ms. Costello's relatives fought back tears, and Mr. Laudor, whose mental state has improved recently, stared ahead and blinked. The prosecution then asked the judge to accept the plea.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pirro, who was in the courtroom but did not address the judge, said the findings of Dr. Dietz, a leading prosecution psychiatrist, had killed the case. ''I don't have a choice,'' she said. ''I'm disappointed in a legal system that allows a psychiatrist to decide whether an individual should stand trial.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Laudor, a native of New Rochelle who will turn 37 on Friday, had graduated summa cum laude from Yale University in three years and was working for a high-powered management consulting firm when he first experienced symptoms of his illness at age 24.</p>
        <p>For eight months, he was hospitalized at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Upper Manhattan, where he received a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, a type of schizophrenia that includes depression. He then moved to a halfway house for the mentally ill in White Plains and improved enough through medication and therapy to enter Yale Law School. He did so well there that he was asked to join the school as an associate.</p>
        <p>While looking for a position as a law professor and working as a mental-health advocate in the New York area in 1996, Mr. Laudor signed a book and movie deal for his life story worth $2.1 million. At the time of the killing, he was still working on the manuscript.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laudor and Ms. Costello had dated for years after they met in 1991 in New Haven, where she was working and he was attending Yale Law School. She, too, had gone to Yale, receiving a bachelor's degree in literature in 1984. Friends say the two had a very loving relationship, and Ms. Costello, who, at her death, was associate director of technology at the Edison Project, supported him through his illness.</p>
        <p>In court today, Mr. Laudor answered several questions from the judge. Although his voice was breathy and strained, his answers were lucid, and he seemed deeply distraught, his face red and contorted, as he listened to the angry and emotional statements read by Ms. Costello's mother and sister.</p>
        <p>''As parents, it is horrifying for us to accept that our daughter was murdered by someone she loved and trusted,'' said Marilyn Costello, whose husband, William, stood at her side. ''It is horrifying for us to accept that our daughter died all alone, bleeding, terrified and in pain. This is a nightmare that haunts our waking as well as our sleeping hours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Laudor's family released a statement after the hearing, expressing relief at the outcome. ''We do not today celebrate any legal victory,'' it read, ''but rather mourn the loss of Caroline Costello.''</p>
