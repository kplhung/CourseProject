        <p>A new federal review of the health effects of malathion, the insecticide sprayed around New York City last year to kill disease-carrying mosquitoes, has found ''suggestive evidence'' that high doses of the chemical may cause cancer in laboratory animals, but no evidence that it poses a threat to people when used properly.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, in more than 1,000 pages of preliminary analysis of malathion issued yesterday and posted on its Web site, found no evidence that would indicate a need for tighter restrictions on the chemical, which is widely used in agriculture, consumer backyard products and mosquito control.</p>
        <p>In particular, the agency concluded that when malathion is sprayed in the very low concentrations that are used to kill mosquitoes, there is no health threat to people. The agency did conclude that an independent scientific advisory panel should take a closer look at studies in laboratory mice and rats hinting that malathion might cause some kinds of tumors when consumed in high doses, but the report also noted that malathion is rarely encountered in concentrations beyond a trace.</p>
        <p>In some city neighborhoods, the spraying operation last year caused more public concern than the West Nile virus, the disease it was aimed at eliminating. The virus, which is transmitted by some mosquitoes, can in rare instances cause deadly encephalitis, a swelling of the brain.</p>
        <p>Last year, seven people died of West Nile encephalitis in and around the city, and 60 others developed serious infections. There was no documented rise in health problems from the spraying, city health officials said.</p>
        <p>''No pesticide is 100 percent safe, and they have to be used in accordance with labeled directions,'' said Stephen L. Johnson, a deputy assistant E.P.A. administrator who is in charge of the agency's pesticide program.</p>
        <p>''But,'' Mr. Johnson added, ''we have concluded that we don't have any level of concern with regard to food or drinking water or the use of malathion in a program to control mosquitoes, boll weevils or medflies.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, private environmental groups, the pesticide industry and city and federal officials had widely varying reactions to the E.P.A. report. Some said that the newly identified potential cancer risk was a reason for heightened concern, while others said the report gave the chemical a clean bill of health, as long as it is used correctly.</p>
        <p>Laura Haight, a pesticide expert at the New York Public Research Interest Group, a private consumer and environmental group in Albany, said it was important for the agency and the public to keep in mind that cancer is only one factor to watch for with chemicals such as malathion.</p>
        <p>''All this focus on the cancer causing potential of these pesticides is missing other harmful effects,'' she said. ''Malathion is a nerve toxin and can cause acute reactions. There are non-cancer health hazards that are still very serious.''</p>
        <p>But agency officials said the review took into account every possible health impact of the chemical.</p>
        <p>Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said, ''We're reassured by the findings of federal scientists that malathion used in mosquito control is of negligible health concern.''</p>
        <p>But he said that until the review becomes final sometime late this year, the city planned to avoid using malathion for mosquito control and would only use other sprays as a last resort, if the West Nile virus emerges again in force.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. is accepting public comments on its findings for 60 days, then will issue a revised report and take public comments once again before publishing its final conclusions, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Malathion is one of 43 organophosphate pesticides approved for use in the United States. These chemicals, related to nerve gas, kill insects by disrupting the action of their nerve cells. Some, including malathion, have been known to cause neurological problems in people in high doses.</p>
        <p>In the report, the agency did find a few instances in which people might be exposed to levels that pose some health risks: for instance, if a toddler plays in a backyard sprayed recently by a homeowner, or when adults pick fruits in gardens or farms where malathion was recently applied.</p>
        <p>''You shouldn't stand out and be sprayed, you should make sure your children and pets are indoors and toys removed,'' Mr. Johnson said. But, he added, for cancer particularly, no evidence of a threat to people was found, even if they are exposed.</p>
        <p>The new appraisal of malathion was initiated by the E.P.A. as part of an ongoing reassessment of all the 20,000 pesticides in use. The reassessment was called for under the 1996 Food Quality Protection Act.</p>
        <p>Under the law, the agency must judge the merits of a chemical solely by measuring its impacts on health and the environment, and must determine all the potential routes by which someone could be exposed -- through diet, work and exposure in air or water. This is a much stricter standard than the agency's previous approach, which had also taken into account a chemical's economic benefits, agency officials said.</p>
        <p>Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota, reacting to the findings, said that the study rebuffed critics of the city's spraying operation last year.</p>
        <p>''This is a much lower risk assessment than you'll find on your common can of bug spray that you find under your kitchen sink,'' Mr. Lhota said yesterday.</p>
        <p>But Representative Gary L. Ackerman of Queens said that the indications of a cancer link -- though confined to laboratory tests -- showed that the chemical was not as benign as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani portrayed it to be last year.</p>
        <p>''In so many press conferences, they said it was perfectly safe,'' Mr. Ackerman said.</p>
