        <p>AN elfin, top-hatted statue perched high on a venerable red-brick building at Houston and Lafayette Streets leans over the sidewalk, holding a mirror above the passing crowds.

        <p>AN elfin, top-hatted statue perched high on a venerable red-brick building at Houston and Lafayette Streets leans over the sidewalk, holding a mirror above the passing crowds. The gold-leaf figure is Puck, the playful sprite of Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream,'' whose mischievous spirit animates the building that takes his name and the scene below on which he muses. For along Houston Street, Puck, who proclaims ''What fools these mortals be!,'' has a rich array of humanity to marvel at. There are finger-snapping jazz-hounds, 4 a.m. pool sharks, dancing fools, fools waiting behind a velvet rope to start dancing, pregnant folk singers, walkers, poseurs from SoHo (south of Houston), shoppers from NoHo (north of Houston), gardeners, noshers, moviegoers of every stripe -- and a handful of sinks for the bar and bathroom, if not the kitchen.</p>
        <p>If this be folly, play on.</p>
        <p>By night and by day, for a river-to-river slice of city life as varied and colorful as the mondo-maki fare at Mr. Sushi, Houston Street is unrivaled. By night, where else could one find what in many cities would be impossible -- a $9.95 lobster dinner a few doors down from hearty Tibetan cuisine, just a stroll away from headlining rap and folk artists and films both conventional and controversial?</p>
        <p>By day, one can find arguably the world's best knish, urban garden and barroom bar. Not to mention more playgrounds than you could shake a stickball at. Plus water views, the arch of bridges spanning the East River in the shadow of the Lillian Wald and Bernard Baruch housing projects and the majestic expanse of the Hudson as it widens into the Narrows.</p>
        <p>The street is kind to filmgoers, offering two fine houses. At 18 West Houston is the Angelika Film Center, where one can take in anything from the latest foreign movie to more mainstream fare. It has the feel of a bohemian multiplex, with its beret tipped to more eclectic tastes in both film and food, selling vegan baked goods upstairs and decent popcorn downstairs. Do obey the signs and refrain from wearing Rollerblades here!</p>
        <p>Across town, the Film Forum (209 West Houston) feels much homier, and its offerings tilt a bit more to the avant-garde and the socially conscious. The latte-sipping crowd at the Angelika is a mix of college students and middle-aged adventurers. At the Film Forum, you could expect a younger Woody Allen waiting in line for ''The Sorrow and the Pity.'' It was here that, along with my fiance, Pete Newman, who accompanied me on my trans-Houston journey, I caught ''The Specialist,'' Eyal Sivan's chilling documentary on the Eichmann trial.</p>
        <p>For music, our favorite was the Mercury Lounge (217 East Houston), tucked in the back of what was once the servants' quarters to the Astor Mansion, then later a tombstone store. One monument remains embedded in part of the bar's countertop. The night we visited the music room, which felt as if it were lighted by exit signs, we found comfortable seating, famously good acoustics and Sara Hickman, the Texas singer-songwriter who sat with her guitar right up against her very round belly, making us wonder how her lively, pleasing music sounded to the child growing inside.</p>
        <p>Xena Night and Hip-Hop</p>
        <p>A few blocks east, we poked into Meow Mix (269 East Houston), which features Xena Night every second Tuesday, for watching the warrior princess. Most nights it's a lesbian bar, but not exclusively so, especially on evenings with bands that attract a broad audience.</p>
        <p>And for an active dance scene with a D.J., crystal chandeliers and music ranging from hip-hop to techno to contemporary, there's the nightclub Chaos in the old Provident Loan Society Building, which once housed Jasper Johns's studio (225 East Houston). The club has just introduced a new modern-style lounge downstairs, in contrast with the Oriental-rug, red-velvet Old World of upstairs.</p>
        <p>On the west side, the Zinc Bar (90 West Houston) has a wide variety of live music. For a good Cuban singer, there's Xiomara, on Thursdays.</p>
        <p>At S.O.B.'s, at Houston and Varick Streets, I'm afraid we looked too suburban as we stepped up for admission to Large Professor + Mad Skilz. ''You know, this is hip-hop,'' one bouncer warned us. ''Rap music,'' the other added, in case we didn't get it. The first one frisked Pete, but the second one waved his colleague off, as if we were obviously too green to be packing heat. Inside, the music was pounding with urban energy as the professor talked his lyrics at a virtuosic pace. The only thing that shocked us, frankly, was the cost of two run-of-the-mill drinks -- $15. When we left later, we noticed the windows on Houston rattling with the bass.</p>
        <p>For night owls in search of a landing spot, there's SoHo Billiards at Houston and Mulberry Streets. Though pool aficionados complain that it looks more like a car dealership than a cozy, traditional tucked-away pool hall, it has an ample supply of tables and is open until 4 a.m. on weekends. We were not charmed by the funky, terribly dusty, stucco ceiling and the odor of a soggy rec-room; we'd hoped to see more characters and fewer regular-looking people. But once we found two cue sticks that were acceptably symmetrical, we had a couple of enjoyable midnight games, for only $10 an hour for two.</p>
        <p>'So Come In Already'</p>
        <p>Daytime brought a different look to Houston Street. Pete and I made a five-and-a-half-mile round-trip trek across the thoroughfare, from the artistically renovated Broadway-Lafayette subway station along the south side, east to the East River, and then back along the north side and west to the Hudson. Finally, we returned east to our starting point at the subway stop.</p>
        <p>Our journey, along the border between the named streets south of Houston and the numbered avenues to the north, took us through an urban kaleidoscope that had served as way station and home to waves of immigrants from Jews and Hispanics on the East Side to Italians on the West, to the hip and arty in recent decades. We marveled at random, captivating images: a lady carrying an armful of pussywillows, a dog being hand-fed a hot dog, the shaggy calf and foot of a man receiving a streetside pedicure, a cormorant floating peacefully on the East River, a pondful of turtles at a community garden, a shredded prom corsage in the gutter under a tunnel-like building near the West Side Highway and colorful seven-story murals on the sides of buildings.</p>
        <p>One recent Sunday we headed east from Broadway -- which divides east from west on Houston Street --  because it was early in the afternoon and because Pete loves knishes. Ages ago, he had heard about Yonah Schimmel's (137 East Houston) and the fresh knishes that rise from the basement on the dumbwaiter: sweet potato knishes, ''buy them for the party'' chocolate knishes, kasha knishes to go or blueberry knishes at the tables. The descendants of people who couldn't wait to leave the Lower East Side flock back to this knish emporium between Eldridge and Forsyth Streets for the authentic taste of Yiddish eats. ''So come in already,'' the store's Web site admonishes.</p>
        <p>We proceeded east to Russ and Daughters (179 East Houston), an 85-year-old family food tradition, which was likewise packed with people ordering whitefish, garlic paste, goat cheese and caviar.</p>
        <p>''My grandfather was one of those Eastern Europeans who had a hard work ethic but not much patience,'' said Mark Russ Federman, 55, who gave up his law practice to go into the business. ''Customers would come in like they still do and say: 'I don't want this! Trim the fat off that!,' and he'd reply, 'Did I invite you?,' and throw them out. The business wasn't doing so well until he brought in his three daughters. They'd stand behind the counter smiling, and it was quite unusual at the time to see pretty young women reaching into herring barrels.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Federman's mother, Anne, is the youngest of the three daughters, who have all retired to Florida, ''in the same shtetl,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Farther east, three cats graced the merchandise at NY Bars and Backbars (49 East Houston), where one could buy an official, original Automat machine, complete with the labels from the days when it sold Manhattan cheesecake for three nickels. Across the street we enjoyed poking through Manhattan Castles and Props (74 East Houston), offering bathtubs, subway signs, sinks and antiques al fresco, in a caged-off slice of the sidewalk that gives it the air of being slightly forbidden.</p>
        <p>A Community Garden</p>
        <p>My favorite block coincided with a bit of a thunderstorm. Just east of the Bowery, we had arrived at the Liz Christy Bowery-Houston Garden, named for the founder of the Green Guerrillas who died in 1985 at age 40. As we strolled among the community garden's apricot tulips, trilliums and nasturtium seedlings in cold frames, we noticed a young man standing on one of the rough-hewn, wooden public seats struggling to thread his umbrella handle through the latticework above it. Satisfied, he sat in the corner, and his beloved nestled her head beneath his shoulder, under the open umbrella, protected from the rain.</p>
        <p>''This place defies the city,'' Pete said, after we had counted about a dozen turtles surfacing around the rim of the garden's fish pond. The place is open to the public when there are gardeners present, and from noon to 4 p.m. on Saturdays, and 6 p.m. until dusk during the growing seasons.</p>
        <p>Houston Street was named after William Houstoun, a delegate from Georgia to the Continental Congress of 1784 and -- more important for naming purposes -- the son-in-law of Nicholas Bayard III, who owned property on which the street was built. The spelling was shortened in the 1800's, confusing tourists who mispronounce it with a ''you'' sound, like the Texas city, as opposed to an ''ow'' sound.</p>
        <p>Early in that century, it was considered a rural and residential enclave of ''uptown'' Manhattan, which later gave way to factories and became a center for the printing trades. It was in this milieu that the erstwhile humor magazine Puck thrived inside the 1885 Romanesque Revival structure at Lafayette Street built to house it. The building was once also home to Spy magazine; it is now the frequent host of upscale weddings and home to Pratt Institute's Manhattan outpost.</p>
        <p>The thoroughfare is unusually wide, especially by New York standards, and, with a few more trees, could pass as a boulevard. When Houston Street was widened, many buildings flanking the street were sliced off, exposing the blank walls of their next-door neighbors. On the south side, at the corner of Thompson Street, the Japan Artists Society has sponsored a building-high mural of two cats, with a city in the background, containing the following announcement: ''A pondering feline is melting into the Socratic skyline.''</p>
        <p>Architectural Jewels</p>
        <p>We strolled by McKim, Mead &amp; White's 1894 Cable building at Broadway, a jewel in the crown of the neighborhood's fabled cast-iron district. The building, foot-stompingly beautiful and believed to be designed by Stanford White, was once the powerhouse for cable cars moving from the Battery as far north as 36th Street. (Wheels 26 feet in diameter pulled the cables under Broadway.)</p>
        <p>After a short amble past I. M. Pei's New York University housing, we came upon the anomalous Time Landscape at Houston and LaGuardia Place -- a 25-by-40-foot fenced-in area depicting what Manhattan looked like in more pastoral times. The pristine woodland was created, then sealed off, by the artist Alan Sonfist, and encourages reflection on what Houston Street might have been in an earlier era.</p>
        <p>Another source of contemplation, two blocks west at Sullivan Street, is the Church of St. Anthony of Padua, a reminder of the neighborhood's Italian pedigree, which honors its patron saint with a lively street festival in June.</p>
        <p>While playgrounds appear every few blocks, especially on the east side with Hamilton Fish Park at Pitt Street and Sara D. Roosevelt Park at Chrystie Street, I particularly enjoyed one for dogs: the Mercer-Houston Dog Run Association, complete with hose and a small dog pool, open by membership. This little park at Mercer Street attracts quite a crowd of spectators when it fills up in the late afternoons for a canine happy hour.</p>
        <p>Posters and River Views</p>
        <p>On our westward journey, once we crossed the Avenue of the Americas, the feel of the street changed, becoming more like any Greenwich Village lane than an arterial. On this western swing we found a few pleasant surprises.</p>
        <p>We explored Alphaville (226 West Houston), which specializes in vintage toys and movie posters. I was particularly drawn to the full sheets of Wacky Packs sporting stickers with such spoofs of name-brand products as Gadzooka Bubble Gum and Botch Tape that I had adored in grade school. The owners, Steve Karchin and Gary Kraut, had traveled far and wide in their quest for ''childhood artifacts,'' particularly from the 1940's, 50's and 60's.</p>
        <p>In true Manhattan fashion, public toilets and access to the scenic riverfronts are as hard to find around here as a person wearing fewer than three black garments. And be warned that gaining access to river vistas at either end of Houston Street can be daunting. Trying to get to the East River, we had to risk crossing a traffic circle with inadequate crosswalks, as cars left the F.D.R. Drive. On the West Side, we walked confidently to the farthest reaches of the Pier 40 parking garage, pretending we had left a car there, so we could lean over the top-floor railing for a gorgeous, albeit challenging, view of the Hudson.</p>
        <p>From Sushi to Cichetti</p>
        <p>For dining, by day or by night, Houston Street offers a wide variety of choices, heavily weighted toward the West Side. We had to keep heading back to the blocks between Macdougal Street and La Guardia Place for the temptations of cheap lobster (El Paso, 134 West Houston), very affordable sushi (Mr. Sushi, 142 West Houston, with ample avocado in the California rolls -- the mark of a good sushi bar) and the lure of Tibet on Houston (136 West Houston), offering an appetizing cuisine we had never sampled. Check out the daikon radish dishes.</p>
        <p>A few blocks east, Arturo's Restaurant-Pizzeria (106 West Houston)  offers live music most nights, outdoor seats and tasty pasta dishes.  For a nightcap there's Madame X (94 West Houston), a moody downstairs bar dressed all in red, which offers live music weekday nights.</p>
        <p>And if you're around in the daytime, you might want to pick up some gnocchi at Raffetto's (144 West Houston), one of New York's oldest pasta makers.</p>
        <p>On the East Side we couldn't resist the 1940's appeal of Sunday brunch at Katz's Deli (205 East Houston), still conjuring up its wartime slogan: ''Send a salami to your boy in the Army.'' We could, however, send back the foul, poorly diluted orange juice from concentrate. The perfectly browned blintzes and authentic knishes made up for that, as did all those letters from recent presidents, blown up to five feet in height, thanking the owners for all the salamis.</p>
        <p>On my way to a party farther east on the Lower East Side, I was hard-pressed to find inspiring dinner choices, and ended up at the Clinton Restaurant (293 East Houston),  where the shrimp salad was good and plentiful, the avocados were unavailable and the wallpaper, of faded pheasants and mountain scenes, was probably older than everyone in there. It was here, south of the border of Alphabet City, that I got a pungent taste of the street's Hispanic flavor. Marc Anthony and Luis Vargas played on the jukebox, and the menu was presented in both Spanish and English, with more Spanish spoken.</p>
        <p>We followed the crowds to Cafe Colonial (73 East Houston), which features Brazilian cuisine, though that's not obvious from the decor,  which favors old advertising signs in English. The Brazilian beer was dark and copious, the hearts-of-palm salad with Roquefort cheese attracted the forks of everyone around the table, and the steaks were very well received.</p>
        <p>For gracious atmosphere, Ballato Restaurant (55 East Houston) and Bar Cichetti (220 West Houston) ranked high. We liked the way the maitre d' at Ballato welcomed some of his patrons by name, ushering them in to the warm dining room, with its distressed plaster and Old-World feel.</p>
        <p>At Bar Cichetti, the yellow walls, done half in bead board, formed the perfect backdrop for the two bottles of Veuve Clicquot our friends bought to toast our engagement.</p>
