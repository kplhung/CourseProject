        <p>After pulling out of a brief slump, Scott Gomez was skating freely and effectively again for the fourth consecutive game, making plays for himself and his linemates from his center position. With the Devils ahead of the Maple Leafs by a goal and dominating the game, Gomez confidently skated into the left-wing corner of the Toronto zone near the end of the first period.</p>
        <p>Two tough Leafs -- Tie Domi and Dmitri Yushkevich -- decided to make a Gomez sandwich. They were the slices of bread. Gomez was the jelly.</p>
        <p>''Oh! I hadn't had the wind knocked out of me for a while,'' Gomez said later, with a smile, after the Devils eliminated the Leafs in Game 6 of the National Hockey League's Eastern Conference semifinals with a 3-0 victory Monday night at Continental Arena. ''That's what happened. Oh, my God! That is not a good feeling. The worst thing was, I had to skate by their bench and hear it from everyone. I couldn't breathe there for the second.''</p>
        <p>Does he expect more of the same treatment in the next series, when the Devils play Philadelphia for the conference championship in the third round of a four-round tournament?</p>
        <p>''Hopefully not,'' Gomez said. ''We'll see.''</p>
        <p>He is learning a lot this season, this 20-year-old Hispanic-American from Alaska. Gomez played 14 minutes 25 seconds Monday, about as much as most Devils forwards. He put three shots on goal.</p>
        <p>But, earlier in the series, things were not so good. The first message was nonverbal. His ice time was dwindling. The second message was more direct: the spoken word, with Larry Robinson. The Devils' coach called Gomez into a private meeting and said it did not matter that Gomez is the likely winner of the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year in the National Hockey League.</p>
        <p>That was for then, the regular season. This was for now, the Stanley Cup playoffs. In the first round, Gomez contributed a goal against the Florida Panthers in Game 1 and nothing else for the next three games. In the second round, against the Leafs, Gomez had no points in the first two games.</p>
        <p>If the trend continued, Gomez was told, he might be a healthy scratch, a player out of uniform without being injured. That would be an embarrassment for the only man to play in all 82 games in a Devils uniform during the regular season.</p>
        <p>''If that doesn't light a fire under you, I don't know what does,'' Gomez said, referring to his conversation with the coach. ''There's no way I didn't want to be a part of this. I guess I was kind of taking things for granted, maybe thinking I had a good year, that I deserved this or that. It doesn't work that way.''</p>
        <p>Although he had no points Monday, Gomez finished the series with 2 goals and 3 assists for 5 points. With 6 points over all in the playoffs, he is tied for third-most on the team. Two of them came in Game 5, on Saturday night, a 4-3 victory in Air Canada Center. In the second period, Gomez set up Sergei Nemchinov for the goal that tied the score at 2-2.</p>
        <p>In the third period, after exiting the penalty box, Gomez set up Vladimir Malakhov for the goal that put the Devils ahead to stay. It was not your average assist. With Malakhov reading the play and moving up into the rush from the defense, Gomez passed the puck to him with a behind-the-back move from the playbook of Magic Johnson.</p>
        <p>It was an audacious deed, the kind that appears on highlight reels of sportscasts, the sort of thing that rookies do not always try on the road in the playoffs. Gomez said the same play was available to him earlier in the game but he was afraid to make it.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to risk the pass,'' Gomez said, adding that he did not want to turn over the puck at the Toronto blue line. ''This time, I saw Vladdie from the corner of my eye. I saw he beat his guy. I was going to shoot, but it kind of went in between my legs. So I said 'Here we go.' I was a little lucky.''</p>
        <p>And very skilled. Gomez seems to work well with Russian players, among the most talented in the sport. His new linemates lately have been Nemchinov and Alexander Mogilny. He also seemed to be in sync with Malakhov. Since moving from left wing back to his natural position at center, Gomez has shown the instinctive and generous soft touch for playmaking that reminds aficionados of Igor Larionov, the future Hall of Famer from Russia who plays in Detroit.</p>
        <p>But Gomez is not yet a master of the pivot position. Among other things, Robinson told him to improve on his face-offs. In Game 5, Gomez won nine and lost seven, a pretty good percentage. In Game 6, he won five and lost seven. He admitted that he has not always paid attention to this detail.</p>
        <p>''I had to take seriously how important draws were,'' Gomez said. ''I've always been that way, not giving 100 percent on the draw. Well, in the playoffs, every draw is so important.'' Referring in general to the team objective as it prepares for the Stanley Cup semifinals, Gomez said: ''The more you start thinking about the Stanley Cup, the more you want to get there. I'm young, so I probably don't really understand like some of these other guys. But you don't get too many chances with a great team like this.''</p>
