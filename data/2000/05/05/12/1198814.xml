        <p>Vanessa Castagna, J. C. Penney's new executive vice president and chief operating officer, is making demands again. At a summit conference for suppliers yesterday at Penney's headquarters in Plano, Tex., the imposing Ms. Castagna, who is nearly 6 feet tall in heels, strode back and forth as she hammered away on what it would take to turn around the ailing department store chain she now runs.</p>
        <p>''We have got to be more timely, more current and ship modern merchandise that is trend right,'' she tells the suppliers, demanding that apparel makers provide more fashionable goods already priced on hangers so that they can go right to the selling floor.</p>
        <p>''We are asking more of them, requiring more of them,'' Ms. Castagna explained in an interview after the meeting, ''and they love it.''</p>
        <p>Love, perhaps, is a tad strong, but certainly Ms. Castagna has generated plenty of positive buzz since she jumped ship from Wal-Mart Stores nine months ago. Fresh off the triumph of revamping Wal-Mart's once-dowdy apparel section into one of its most successful departments, Ms. Castagna is viewed as the kind of results-oriented executive who can finally shake Penney out of its longstanding ennui.</p>
        <p>''She focused on changes internally as well as externally,'' said Kim Roy, a group president at Liz Claiborne, who attended an earlier conference for apparel makers. ''It really bodes well for Penney.''</p>
        <p>Already Ms. Castagna has demanded a number of changes: everything from giving her suppliers scorecards to asking her store managers to work on Saturdays. But no one underestimates the task before her.</p>
        <p>With a decentralized business culture that had left an unusual amount of buying power in the hands of individual store managers, Penney has been slow to reach customers with up-to-date styles. Its aging stores are overstocked with slow-selling, oddball merchandise that makes them seem cluttered. And a tradition of promoting only from within left the company bereft of top talent.</p>
        <p>As a result, while direct competitors like Kohl's and Target have been growing at close to double-digit rates in recent years, Penney completely missed the late 1990's consumer spending spree. Year over year, the company's sales per store have actually declined in all but 9 of the last 28 months.</p>
        <p>Penney's stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the last two years, leaving investors fuming for change and making the company a prime takeover target. Last week, in a filing with federal regulators, Carl C. Icahn, the corporate raider, indicated that he was buying Penney's stock and might take up to a 15 percent stake in the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Icahn could simply be looking for a passive investment in a company he thinks is undervalued or he might be considering a takeover that would allow him to split Penney into its component parts.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Ms. Castagna has found her importance as a symbol of change growing as other high-level executives have defected. And the ultimate test could come soon. Just last week, James E. Oesterreicher, Penney's chief executive and chairman, said that he would step down and that a search for a replacement was under way. Penney said it would look both inside and outside the company to fill the position, but Ms. Castagna is clearly one of the front-runners.</p>
        <p>A 28-year veteran of the retail industry, Ms. Castagna is short on financial and operations background but long on merchandising talent. She had senior merchandising responsibilities at Lazarus, a division of Federated Department Stores; at Target, the stylish discounter; and at Marshall's. But Ms. Castagna is best known for her work at Wal-Mart, where she became senior vice president and general merchandising manager for women's apparel in 1996.</p>
        <p>At that time Wal-Mart's clothing assortment was of low quality and poorly presented. Customers may have been happy to pick up a bargain, like a decal t-shirt for $4.99, but they were skipping over the higher-priced and more profitable sweater sets and jean jackets.</p>
        <p>Ms. Castagna is widely credited with helping Wal-Mart clearly identify a strong image for each of its clothing brands. She had a keen eye for the one or two fashion items to promote. But just as important was the structure she built for decision making.</p>
        <p>''She created a process of planning,'' said Tom Burns, who worked as a consultant to Wal-Mart when he was with the Doneger Group. ''She created different teams for each brand. And she created her own product-development team that worked on identifying trends.''</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart does not break out apparel sales in its financial statements, but analysts say it is clear she helped both sales and profitability. ''When Vanessa was there, food sales began to increase at a rate of 30 to 40 percent a year due to Wal-Mart Supercenter expansion,'' said Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers. ''Yet at that time, apparel, as a percent of the total, remained the same, which confirms the point that apparel sales did well during her reign.''</p>
        <p>Even more critically, Ms. Castagna managed to adapt and thrive at Wal-Mart, which, with its headquarters in the small town of Bentonville, Ark., and a dearth of woman executives, is known for its good ol' boy atmosphere.</p>
        <p>She succeeded, colleagues say, because she is tough -- in a nice way. Known to work 100-hour weeks herself, Ms. Castagna demands a lot of her staff but she also entrusts them with a high level of responsibility.</p>
        <p>''She works through people very well,'' said Paul R. Charron, chief executive of Liz Claiborne, which does business with both Penney and Wal-Mart. ''You won't see her taking over meetings and usurping the prerogatives of a subordinate.''</p>
        <p>Warren D. Feldberg, who served as Ms. Castagna's boss at both Target and Marshall's, echoes that view. ''She is a cheerleader,'' he said. ''She describes it as putting on her pompoms.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Castagna is no shrinking violet. ''If you call her to see how business is going,'' said Richard Baker, the chief executive of the sporting-goods manufacturer Ocean Pacific and a longtime business friend, first ''she'll tell you how your business is going.''</p>
        <p>All her leadership skills will certainly be tested at Penney, which is famously insular and unresponsive. ''When the report card comes in on Vanessa, she will have earned her 'A' grade more for what she was able to elicit from the J. C. Penney community than what she did for suppliers,'' Mr. Charron predicted.</p>
        <p>Ms. Castagna has already started pushing internally just as hard as she has been seeking external changes. Under her direction the retailer has adopted a new compensation policy, making bonuses more contingent on total company performance and less tied to the gains of one division or store.</p>
        <p>At an April meeting with store managers, she zeroed in on the contrast between Wal-Mart managers who take Tuesdays and Wednesdays off and store managers at Penney, who are often off on the busy weekend shopping days. ''We have to have the best people being there when the customers need them,'' she said firmly.</p>
        <p>At the same time, she is doing away with many of Penney's traditional business practices. For example, Penney had long prided itself on a decentralized ordering system that allowed individual store managers to make the bulk of the purchasing decisions. Not long ago, the company moved to limit the autonomy of store managers but Ms. Castagna was not satisfied. She recently demanded that all ordering be centralized at headquarters to create a more consistent image.</p>
        <p>Outside, Ms. Castagna has moved to improve Penney's dealings with its suppliers. ''It has been our history that we did not share information with suppliers,'' she said. ''It was a contractual relationship. We would say, 'This is what Penney's wants.' '' Ms. Castagna has tried to make that a more reciprocal relationship. As of November, suppliers could monitor sales of any of their own items at any store through a Web site Penney established.</p>
        <p>Typical of her carrot-and-stick methods, Ms. Castagna announced that Penney would give suppliers scorecards rating them on sales, profits, swiftness of product turnover and other things. They will also be able to see other suppliers' ratings so they can gain insight on the competition.</p>
        <p>In return for all this information, Ms. Castagna wants suppliers to give Penney first crack at new products, to shorten delivery times and to ship merchandise ''floor ready'' with hangers and price tags in place. She also insists that the suppliers stop giving Penney their second-tier staff. ''We want people who can analyze the business, not just salesmen,'' she explains.</p>
        <p>It is probably too early to see much improvement in sales, but Penney says inventory and related costs are already down substantially. Ms. Castagna says she believes the seeds she has planted will not bear real fruit until next year.</p>
        <p>''This is not about remodeling a store, or changing a buying or shipping mode,'' she says. ''We are changing the business model.''</p>
