        <p>IT looks more at home at Truckstops of America than alongside Golden Pond, but there's no denying that the Kingsley Coach Camelot is a recreational vehicle with presence.</p>
        <p>At 45 feet long, the Camelot Merlin brushes up against some states' size restrictions on R.V.'s. (Other models range from 34 to 40 feet.) Its 380-square-foot living area is as spacious as a good many Manhattan apartments, and sections slide out to expand the rooms. There are solid-oak cabinets, double-door refrigerators, tiled bathrooms, washer-dryer hookups and surround-sound entertainment systems. A sales brochure shows a unit with mirrored ceilings throughout. (Any rest stop can be a love nest.)</p>

        <p>IT looks more at home at Truckstops of America than alongside Golden Pond, but there's no denying that the Kingsley Coach Camelot is a recreational vehicle with presence.</p>
        <p>At 45 feet long, the Camelot Merlin brushes up against some states' size restrictions on R.V.'s. (Other models range from 34 to 40 feet.) Its 380-square-foot living area is as spacious as a good many Manhattan apartments, and sections slide out to expand the rooms. There are solid-oak cabinets, double-door refrigerators, tiled bathrooms, washer-dryer hookups and surround-sound entertainment systems. A sales brochure shows a unit with mirrored ceilings throughout. (Any rest stop can be a love nest.)</p>
        <p>But what makes the vehicle distinctive is its foundation: It is, essentially, a semi-truck -- the kind used for long-haul loads -- that you can can call home.</p>
        <p>Kingsley Coach Inc. of Middleburg, Pa., mounts an R.V. body to a stretched truck chassis and opens the back of the cab to the living quarters. Underneath are luggage bays and up front is a real big-rig engine, a Detroit Diesel Series 60 that makes 500 horsepower, gets 9.3 miles per gallon and can haul 85,000 pounds. (The unit weighs around 38,000.)</p>
        <p>Since the Merlin is an R.V., a driver needs only a standard license, said Terry A. Watkins, Kingsley's chief executive. For ease of use, the 10-speed transmission has computerized shifting, and the 3-axle 10-wheelers are ''not hard to maneuver,'' he said. Helping out are backup cameras, a global-positioning system and collision-avoidance monitors.</p>
        <p>The business plan of the company -- it parked a Camelot recently on Park Avenue as it sought to attract investors -- refers to the ''intangible thrill that just driving a Kingsley gives.''</p>
        <p>Prices range from $230,000 to $400,000, including air horns. The CB radio is included, good buddy.</p>
